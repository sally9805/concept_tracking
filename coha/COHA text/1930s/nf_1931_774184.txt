txt  | the quaternary period is one of the most striking illustra. dons of the lessons which prehistoric archeology may draw from a judicious study of ethnography . Since modern sociology has shed light upon the origin and true character of the first artistic attempts of primitives , we can now recognize without difficulty that all of these drawings may be explained in one and the same manner , that is , as belonging to a group of primitive beliefs , known to scientists as " totemism . " The word , totem , signifying " sign , " " marking , " " family , " was borrowed from the North American Indians . The concepts , however , which are attached to this term are singularly universal , as has been attested by many observers . In Australia as well as in America , the clans believe that they ire under the protection of a guardian being , ordinarily an Animal , which they must persuade by means of favors to shield the interests of the clan . This totem animal becomes in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be found the roots to a large number of the ancestral superstitions of primitives , and even of civilized peoples . The clan affix the image of their totem upon their weapons of offense and defense . Multiplication of the tribe can also be obtained from the totem animal through the intervention of magic . Spencer , Gillen , and Frazer have described the curious ceremonies which the Australians perform toward that end , at the foot of cliffs , ornamented with zoomorphic designs . Many details of these magic rites recall some of the observations made in the grottoes of Perigourdia and the Pyrenees . Salomon Reinach , who is equally well versed in the literature of the totem as in the science of prehistory , was the first to disclose very remarkable facts that have direct bearing upon this question .2 /. s we have seen , the paintings of our caves are usually re . ' note from the entrance . At Niaux the visitor must pass ' . rirough a subterranean gallery , Soo meters long , in order , o find them . At Combarelles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance . Furthermore , Spencer and  | Gillen state that in a great number of cases the Aus tralian paintings which they have considered to be o. totemistic origin " are traced upon rocky walls in localities that are strictly taboo to women , children , and uninitiated youths . " " Certain designs found in our ornamented grottoes also occupy hidden recesses in the walls and inaccessible , bulging surfaces which it must have cost the artist great difficulty to reach . It would , therefore , be impossible to view these designs , which are so well hidden from the sighs of the uninitiated , as mere ornamental decorations or as the products of a pastime occupation of idle Troglodytes . The devotees of the cult of the emou in Australia paint the image of this totem upon the earth , to the accompaniment of intricate rites . Around it the men of the clan dance and sing . Now , in the Pyrenean grotto of Niaux , MM . Cartailhac and Breuil discovered animal designs not only upon the walls , but to their great surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols , painted or scratched upon the figures , conform to these findings . The tectiform sign of the hut is the symbol of ownership affixed by the hunter upon the animal which he should bring back with him to the camp ; but its success is assured by special rites . The magic value of arrow-heads is emphasized even better . " The clan lived on meat , " wrote S. Reinach . " In reproducing the likeness of the animals which furnished their food , they believed they increase their number and stimulate their multiplication , just as the Australian savages believe they stimulate the multiplication of the kangaroos by performing the dance of the kangaroo . The practice of bewitching a living person by inflicting injury or destruct ion upon his image with the intent of harming the living is a phenomenon of the same kind , only inspired by an opposite sentiment . The notion that art is a form of play is perhaps nothing but a modern prejudice ; art began as a t i t ual or act of magic . And when we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know how truly right we are . " " The same author has also called attention to the fact that  | the most useful animals are found most abundantly depicted in these wall paintings and the recent discovery of rare images of carnivorous animals has in no way weakened the value of his observation . It would doubtless be stretching the facts too far to attempt to attribute a religious or symbolic significance to every quaternary design . The various instincts of human nature , as well as the love of ornamentation , have , most likely , rivaled religious beliefs in stimulating art among primitives . It must be recognized , however , that the totemistic interpretation , based upon solidly established facts , explains better than any other hypothesis the origin of the art of the reindeer epoch . Furthermore , it accounts also for its sudden disappearance , which is no less surprising than its brilliant flourish , since the primitive concepts from which these paintings have sprung have been at home among the hunting nomads . During the neolithic period the totemistic superstitions no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henceforth tillers of the soil and shepherds , and it never again gave rise to the same plastic arts 15 If we turn our attention again to the engravings and sculptures carried out upon small objects of durable material , recalling at the same time the resemblance of their numerous animal drawings to the wall paintings , it will appear logical to assume that one part at least of these objects owes its origin to concepts of the same nature . The toothed arrowheads which the bisons of the grotto of Niaux bear on their flanks explain to us the similar arrow-heads engraved upon the prairie dogs of Sorde , and the interpretation of the batons as magic wands seems to us more acceptable than any other conjecture . Z he progress of science has gravely undermined the ancient theory of prehistorians , who , in accordance with the doctrine of G. de Mortillet , refused to concede any religious concept to quaternary man . For , as we have seen , the reindeer hunters did have their sanctuaries and the discovery of these mysterious galleries , revealing the vast distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primitive man , will count among the greatest prehistoric discoveries .

It is difficult to align them with the works of the quaternary age .  | New discoveries of prehistoric man always have popular Hews interest . Reports of them are often distorted or exaggerated , but occasionally they are based upon finds of importance and permanent scientific value . The latest case , the discovery last December 119291 of an ancient human skull near Peking , has been widely heralded as marking a notable advance in our knowledge of early humanity . When Professor G. Elliot Smith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment of early man ever found , " it may be assumed that it is something more than merely " another prehistoric skull , " even though it should fall short of meriting this superlative characterization . I shall attempt here to present briefly the more notable features of this discovery with a minimum of technical deto evaluate it in relation to present knowledge , and to ' tnswer some of the questions people are asking about it . Some two years ago Dr. Davidson Black , professor of anatomy in the Peking Union Medical College , had the temerity , or the foresight , to establish a new genus and species of early man upon the meager basis of a lower molar tooth , found in 1927 in a cave deposit of the early Pleistocene age , at Chou Kou Tien , thirty-seven miles southwest of Peking . He called it Sinanthropus pekinensis ? Chinese man of Peking . ( Time will show whether the creation of a new genus was justified ; at present there is difference of opinion on this point . ) Some other human teeth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavations in 1928 and 1929 yielded additional ones as well as wo fragments of lower jaws and a few small pieces of other footnote * This article was published in The New Republic , August 13 , 1930.  | skull bones , all showing certain primitive features . On December 2 , 1929 , Mr. W. C. Pei , a young Chinese paleontologist , on the staff of the Cenozoic Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China , found in this Chou Kou Tien deposit a human skull which unquestionably belongs to the same type . The skull is incomplete , lacking the facial region ; but the brain case is uncrushed and almost intact . One especially gratifying feature of the discovery is the completeness of its geological and paleontological documentation . In a preliminary report on the geology and paleontology of the Chou Kou Tien deposit , the authors , Pere Teilhard de Chardin and Dr. C. C. Young , present abundant evidence for regarding it as belonging to very early Pleistocene ( Basal Lower Quaternary ) , a period comparable to the very beginning of the Ice Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit proved to be so old as this is a discovery of the first magnitude in human paleontology . As the beginning of the Pleistocene period is variously estimated at from 500,000 to 1,200,000 years ago , a fair guess as to the age of the Peking man might be perhaps upwards of a million years ! Associated with the human fossils are numerous mammalian bones of various species , which establish the geologic age , as they are clearly distinguishable from the species of the preceding Late Pliocene period ( Tertiary ) , and also from those of the subsequent loess , which is of Middle and Later Pleistocene age , The fossilized bones are found in certain fissures at the base of low hills formed largely of limestone . In the days of Sinanthropus these were open clefts or caves , but during the course of ages they became gradually filled with deposits of reel clay , limestone and bones , which finally became cemented together by secondary limestone infiltration , Some of the bones , even the human remains , may have been brought into these rock clefts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , " Sinanthropus itself may once have sheltered within the Chou Kou Tien cave " ; but it if impossible to say definitely whether or not the Peking mar  | was a cave dweller , and as there is complete absence of worked flints or other implements nothing whatsoever is yet known of his cultural status . The definite placing of Sinanthropus in the very early Pleistocene has important bearing on its possible relationship to other ancient types , for this skull may well be the oldest human fossil thus far found . It clearly antedates the Neanderthal race , and is apparently somewhat older than the Heidelberg man . The Java " ape-man , " Pithecanthropus , which was formerly believed by Dr. E. Dubois , who discovered it , to be of Late Tertiary age , is now rather generally regarded , upon strong evidence , as a fairly early Pleistocene form , which implies that it is no more ancient than the Peking man and perhaps not so old . The remains of the Piltdown " dawn man , " Eoanthropus , found in England in 1911-13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commonly held to be also Early or Middle Pleistocene ; though Professor H. F. Osborn has recently advanced the opinion that this type lived as early as Late Pliocene time , which would make him an example of the long sought , but hitherto more or less hypothetical , Tertiary man . But whether older or more recent , the Piltdown type with its apelike teeth and Jaws , rounded cranium and absence of brow ridges , is not , in my opinion , so nearly related to Peking man as are Pithecanthropus and especially the Neanderthal species , but belongs to another and widely divergent branch of our family tree . The discovery of human remains of such great antiquity in China , while highly important , is not in itself very surprising . Central Asia has long been regarded as the presumptive " cradle of humanity , " as also of humanity 's nearest relatives . Paleontology affords cogent evidence for this view which need not be reveiwed here . Expeditions from the American Museum of Natural History have been diligently . seeking man 's ancestors in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ert : al species , widely di tr : , , ed through  | Europe , has recently ( 1925 ) been found as far eastward as Palestine . Flint implements , similar to those of the Mousterian ( Neanderthal ) culture of Europe , have been found in Shensi province in China near the upper Yellow River and also in the Ordos desert in Mongolia . Thus it appears probable that Neanderthal man may have been a widespread Eurasian race rather than limited to the western or European portion of that vast continent . For some years past I have frequently expressed the opinion that the discovery in Asia of Neanderthal man , or a pre-neanderthaloid such as the Heidelberg race , would not be surprising . Therefore , the finding of Sinanthropus , which , as Professor Black truly says , " might well be regarded as pre-neanderthaloid in type , " although a discovery of outstanding importance , can hardly be said to revolutionize our ideas regarding early man , but rather to confirm previous theories . The proving of a theory by new evidence is quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by similar means . Fortunately , Professor Black and his colleagues , instead of withholding the details of their discovery until they could publish a complete description , have generally presented the facts in well-illustrated preliminary reports . The skull , which was partly embedded in hard travertine , has been carefully freed from this matrix , and its main features are clearly exhibited in a series of life-sized photographs recently sent to this country . In size it somewhat exceeds the cranium of Pithecanthropus , but is not quite so large as the female Neanderthal from Gibraltar . In profile view it is almost exactly like the skulls of the well-known Neanderthal species , with the heavy brow ridge overhanging the eyes , so strikingly characteristic of that race , but the crown is even a trifle lower . Seen in top view also the outline is completely neanderthaloid , but when examined from the rear a marked difference is apparent in that the broadest part of this skull is very low , only slightly above the ear openings , the skull  | becoming narrower above this region . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is found also in Pithecanthropus ( and in the Eoanthropus skull as restored ) , must be regarded as an extremely primitive feature , which in correlation with the very flat low crown proves that the brain was less voluminous than in a typical Neanderthal skull of equal length and width . As the cranial capacities of Pithecanthropus and the Gibraltar skull are respectively about 940 and 1,28o cubic centimeters , one might tentatively estimate that of the new skull as somewhere between ' , too and 1,200 cubic centimeters , which is well above the minimum capacity of modern normal crania . The capacity will eventually be determined with approximate accuracy , as a cast of the interior will surely be made , and as the brain case is so nearly complete , only a small portion of the base will require restoration . It is regrettable that nothing is positively known regarding the cranium of Homo ( Paleoanthropus ) heidelbergensis ( of which a lower jaw only was found in Germany in 19o7 ) , as the new Peking skull realizes so admirably the guess one might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the Sinanthropus skull lacks the facial bones , the numerous teeth and two jaw fragments give us some idea of this region . Thus one piece , the anterior part of a jaw containing several teeth , demonstrates the complete absence of any chin prominence . This , together with the dental features , marks additional resemblance to the Neanderthal and Heidelberg types , except that the molars do not show a certain specialized condition known as " taurodonty , " which is observable in some , though not in all , Neanderthal teeth . The canines are not enlarged , nor in any sense apelike , as are those of the Piltdown " dawnman , " and in general the teeth , though primitive and generalized , are completely human . The skull is that of an individual of early adult or adolescent age , and from its general shape and modeling Professor Black considers it to  | be that of a female , but in the absence of other skulls for comparison it is impossible to be certain of the sex . The great development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In brief , Sinanthropus is an extremely early human type , apparently at least as old as any other hominid thus far known , and probably the oldest . Belonging at the beginning of the Pleistocene , its age , as I have said , may be a million years ! Its closest anatomical affinities are with the somewhat later Neanderthal race , and it seems well qualified to be regarded as a pre-neanderthaloid and probably ancestral to the true Neanderthals . Complete knowledge of the more nearly contemporary Heidelberg species might reveal a still closer relationship to that type , but any kinship to the Piltdown man must be quite remote . As for the cultural status of Sinanthropus , there is thus far no evidence whatsoever . This new discovery does not overthrow previous theories , but rather confirms them , as there has been ample reason to anticipate the finding of very early man in Asia , and especially man of neanderthaloid affinities . The possible relation of Sinanthropus to our own species is far more doubtful , We know nothing about it , but regarding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that " Its dental characters certainly would seem to indicate that Sinanthropus could not have been far removed from the type of hominid from which evolved both the extinct Neanderthaler and the modern Homo sapiens . " This is far from being a definite assertion that Peking man was our ancestor . The fact that Sinanthropus lived in China carries no possible implication that he was a pre-mongoloid . A type so ancient that it antedates the emergence of Homo sapiens by hundreds of millenniums can have no special relationship to any particular racial subdivision of " Wise Man , " so we may be sure that this venerable fossil is no more eligible to ancestor worship by the yellow race than by the white or black .  | Fortunately , the Chou Kou Tien cave deposits are not yet depleted . An additional skeletal discovery has already been reported , and we have the right to hope that there will be cultural ones as well .  | TN the present cultural conditions of mankind we observe , or observed at least until very recent time , a cleavage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European and Japanese began to introduce European patterns . Still greater appeared the contrasts between Europeans , native Australians , African Negroes and American Indians . It is , therefore , but natural that much thought has been given to the problem of the interrelation between race and culture Even in Europe cultural differences between North Lure , nears and people of the Mediterranean , between West and East Europeans , are striking and are correlated with differences in physical appearance . This explains why numberless books and essays have been and are being written based on the assumption that each race has its own mental char acter determining its cultural or social behavior . In America particularly fears are being expressed of the effects of intermixture of races , of a modification or deterioration of national character on account of the influx of new types into the population of our country , and policies of controlling the growth of the population are being proposed and laws based on these assumptions have been passed . The differences of cultural outlook and of bodily appearance have given rise to antagonisms that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little clarity in regard to the term " race . " When we speak of racial characteristics we mean those traits that are determined by heredity in each race and in which all members of the race participate . Comparing Swedes and Negroes , lack of pigmentation of skin , eye and hair are footnote *Anthropology . New York : W. W. Norton &; Co.  | hereditary racial characteristics ; or the straight or wavy hair of the Swede , the frizzly hair of the Negro , the narrowness and elevation of the nose among the Swedes , its width and flatness among the Negroes , all these are hereditary racial traits because practically all the Swedes and Negroes participate in them . In other respects it is not so easy to define racial traits . Anatomists can not with certainty differentiate between the brain of a Swede and of a Negro . The brains of each group vary so much in form that it is often difficult to say , if we have no other criteria , whether a certain brain belongs to a Swede or to a Negro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have in common . A knowledge of all the bodily traits of a particular individual from Denmark does not enable us to identify him as a Dane . If he is tall , blond , blue-eyed , long-headed and so on he might as well be a Swede . We also find individuals of the same bodily form in Germany , in France and we may even find them in Italy . Identification of an individual as a member of a definite , local race is pot possible . Whenever these conditions prevail , we can not speak of racial heredity . In a strict sense racial heredity means that all the members of the race partake of certain traits , ? such as the hair , pigmentation and nose form of the Negro , as compared to the corresponding features among the North European . All those forms that are peculiar to some members of the race , not to all , are in no sense true hereditary racial characteristics . The greater the number of individuals exhibiting these traits the less is their racial significance . North Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different forms are represented in either series , and other bodily forms are so much alike that it would be impossible to claim that an individual selected at random must be a North Italian or a Scandinavian . Extreme forms in which the local characteristics are most pronounced plight be identified with a fair degree of probability , but in-  | termediate forms might belong to either group . The bodily traits of the two groups are not racial characteristics in the strict sense of the term . Although it is possible to describe the most common types of these groups by certain metric and descriptive traits , not all the members of the groups conform to them . We are easily misled by general impressions . Most of the Swedes are blond , blue-eyed , tall and long-headed . This causes us to formulate in our minds the ideal of a Swede and we forget the variations that occur in Scandinavia . If we talk of a Sicilian we think of a swarthy , short person , with dark eyea and dark hair . Individuals differing from this type are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical " Sicilian . The more uniform a people the more strongly are we impressed by the ' type . " Every country impresses us as inhabited by a certain type the traits of which are determined by the most frequently occurring forms . This , however , does not tell us anything in regard to its hereditary composition and the range of its variations . The " type " is formed quite subjectively on the basis of our everyday experience . Suppose a Swede , from a region in which blondness , blue eyes , tall stature prevail in almost the whole population , should visit Scotland and express his experiences naively . He would say that there are many individuals of Swedish type , but that besides this another type inhabits the country , of dark complexion , dark hair , and eyes , but tall and longheaded . The population would seem to represent two types , not that biologically the proof would have been given of race mixture ; it would merely be an expression due to earlier experiences . The unfamiliar type stands out as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as racially distinct . Conversely , a Scotchman who visits Sweden would be struck by the similarity between most Swedes and the blond Scotch , and he would say that there is a very large number of the blond Scotch with whom he is familiar , without reaching the conclusion that his own type is mixed .  | We speak of racial types in a similar way . When we see American Indians we recognize some as looking like Asiatics , others like East Europeans , still others are said to be of a Jewish cast . We classify the variety of forms according to our previous experience and we are inclined to consider the divergent forms that are well established in our consciousness as pure types , particularly if they appear as extreme forms . Thus the North European blond and the Armenian with his high nose and his remarkably high head , which is flat behind , appear as pure types . Biologically speaking , this is an unjustifiable assumption . Extreme forms are not pure racial types . We do not know how much their descendants may vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if it were shown that the extreme types were of homogeneous descent , this would not prove that the intermediate types might not be equally homogeneous . It is well to remember that heredity means the transmission of anatomical and functional characteristics from ancestors to offspring . What we call nowadays a race of man consists of groups of individuals in which descent from common ancestors can not be proved . All we know is that the children of a given family represent the hereditarily transmitted qualities of their ancestors . Such a group of brothers and sisters is called a fraternity . Not all the members of a fraternity are alike . They scatter around a certain middle value . If the typical distribution of forms in all the groups of brothers and sisters that constitute the race were alike , then we could talk of racial heredity , for each fraternity would represent the racial characteristics . We can not speak of racial heredity if the fraternities are different , so that the distribution of forms in one family is different from that found in another one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually in all the known races the single  | family lines as represented by fraternities show considerable amount of variation which indicates that the hereditary characteristics of the families are not the same , a result that may be expected whenever the ancestors have distinct heritable characteristics . In addition to this we may observe that a fraternity found in one race may be duplicated by another one in another race ; in other words , that the hereditary characteristics found in one race may not belong to it exclusively , but may belong also to other races . This may be illustrated by an extreme case . If I wish to know " the type " of the New Yorker , I may not pick out any one particular family and claim that it is a good rep-esentative of the type . I might happen to select a family of pure English descent ; and I might happen to strike an Irish , Italian , Jewish , German , Armenian or Negro family . All these types are so different and , if inbred , continue their types so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representative New Yorker . Conditions in France are similar . I can not select at random a French family and consider its members as typical of France . They may be blond Northwest Europeans , darker Central Europeans or of Mediterranean type . In New York as well as in France the family lines are so diverse that there is no racial unity and no racial heredity . Matters are different in old , inbred communities . If a number of families have intermarried for centuries without appreciable addition of foreign blood they will all be closely related and the same ancestral traits will appear in all the families . Brothers and sisters in any one family may be quite unlike among themselves , but all the family lines will have considerable likeness . It is much more feasible to obtain an impression of the general character of the population by examining a single family than in the preceding cases , and a few families would give us a good picture of the whole race . Conditions of this type prevail among the landowners in small European villages . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among some isolated tribes .  | the Eskimos of North Greenland , for instance , have been isolated for centuries . Their number can never have exceeded a few hundred . There are no rigid rules proscribing marriages between relatives , so that we may expect that unions were largely dictated by chance . The ancestors of the tribe were presumably a small number of Eskimos who happened to settle there and whose blood flows in the veins of all the members of the present generation . The people all bear a considerable likeness , but unfortunately we do not know in how far the family lines are alike . We have information of this kind from one of the isolated Tennessee valleys in which people have intermarried among themselves for a century . The family lines in this community are very much alike . In cases of this kind it does not matter whether the ancestry is homogeneous or belongs to quite distinct races . As long as there is continued inbreeding the family lines will become alike . The differences of racial descent will rather appear in the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards one of the ancestral strains , others to the other . The distribution of different racial forms in all the various families will be the more the same , the longer the inbreeding without selection continues . We have a few examples of this kind . The Bastaards of South Africa , largely an old mixture of Dutch and Hottentot , and the Chippewa of eastern Canada , descendants of French and Indians , are inbred communities . Accordingly , the family lines among them are quite similar , while the brothers and sisters in each family differ strongly among themselves . In modern society , particularly in cities , conditions are not favorable to inbreeding . The larger the area inhabited by a people , the denser and the more mobile the population , the less are the families inbred and the more may we expect very diverse types of family lines . The truth of this statement may readily be demonstrated . Notwithstanding the apparent homogeneity of the Swedish nation , there are many different family lines represented .  | Many are " typical " blond Swedes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The range of hereditary forms is considerable . It has been stated before that many individuals of Swedish types may be duplicated in neighboring countries . The same is true of family lines . It would not be difficult to find in Denmark , Germany , Holland or northern France families that might apparently just as well be Swedes ; or in Sweden families that might as well be French or German . In these cases hereditary characteristics are not " racially " determined , but belong to family lines that occur in many " racial " groups . Just as soon as family lines of the same form are found in a number of racial groups the term " racial heredity " loses its meaning . We can speak solely of " heredity in family lines . " The term " racial heredity " presupposes a homogeneity of lines of descent in different races , that do not exist . In short , if we wish to discuss racial traits we have to recognize that a great diversity of these occurs in every race and that they are inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type do not belong to the race as a whole . Another important problem confronts us . We have seen that our concept of types is based on subjective experience . On account of the preponderance of " typical " Swedes we are inclined to consider all those of different type as not belonging to the racial type , as foreign admixtures . There is a somewhat distinct type in Sweden in the old mining districts which were first worked by Walloons and it is more than probable that the great darkness of complexion in this region is due to the influence of Walloon blood . We are very ready to explain every deviation from a type in this way . In many cases this is undoubtedly correct , for intermingling of distinct types of people has been going on for thousands of years ; but we do not know to what extent a type may vary when no admixture of foreign blood has occurred . The experience of animal breeders proves that  | even with intensive inbreeding of pure stock there always remains a considerable amount of variation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent variations of this kind might develop in a pure human race and it is not probable that satisfactory evidence will ever be forthcoming , because we have no pure races . The history of the whole world shows us mankind constantly on the move ; people from eastern Asia coming to Europe ; those of western and central Asia invading southern Asia ; North Europeans sweeping over Mediterranean countries ; Central Africans extending their territories over almost the whole of South Africa ; people from Alaska spreading to northern Mexico or vice versa ; South Americans settling almost over the whole eastern part of the continent here and there , ? in short , from earliest times on we have a picture of continued movements , and with it of mixtures of diverse people . It may well be that the lack of clean-cut geographical and biological lines between the races of man is entirely due to these circumstances . The conditions are quite like those found in the animal world . Local races of remote districts may readily be recognized , but in many cases they are united by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of sharp distinctions between neighboring populations it happens that apparently identical family lines occur in both , and that an individual in one may resemble in bodily form an individual in another . Notwithstanding their resemblances it can be demonstrated that they are functionally not by any means equivalent , for when we compare their children they will be found to revert more or less to the type of the population to which the parents belong . To give an example : the Bohemians have , on the average , round heads , the Swedes long heads . Nevertheless it is possible to find among both populations parents that have , the same head forms . The selected group among the Swedes will naturally be more round-headed than the average Swede , and the  | selected Bohemians will be more long-headed than the average Bohemians . The children of the selected group of Swedes are found to be more long-headed than their parents , those of the selected group of Bohemians more short-headed than their parents . The cause of this is not difficult to understand . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an individual nonhereditary trait . Furthermore the general run of their relatives will be similar to the long-headed Swedish type and since the form of the offspring depends not only upon the parent , but also upon the characteristics of his whole family line , at least of his foul grandparents , a reversion to the general population may be expected . The same is true among the Bohemians . We must conclude that individuals of the same bodily appearance , if sprung from populations of distinct type , are functionally not the same . For this reason it is quite unjustifiable to select from a population a certain type and claim that it is identical with the corresponding type of another population . Each individual must be studied as a member of the group from which he has sprung . We may not assume that the round-headed or brunette individuals in Denmark are identical with the corresponding forms from Switzerland . Even if no anatomical differences between two series of such individuals are discernible they represent genetically distinctive strains . Identity can occur in exceptional individuals only . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sicilians , men and women , who marry among themselves , we must expect that their offspring in later generations will revert more or less to the Sicilian type , and , conversely , if we select a group of brunette , brown-eyed Swedes , their offspring will revert more or less to the blond , blue-eyed Swedish type . We have spoken so far only of the hereditary conditions of stable races . We imply by the term racial heredity that the composition of succeeding generations is identical . When one generation dies , the next one is assumed to represent  | the same type of population . This can be true only if random matings occur in each generation . If in the first generation there was a random selection of mates , due to chance only , the same condition must prevail in the following generations . Any preferential mating , any selective change in group mortality or fertility , or brought about by migration , must modify the genetic composition of the group . For these reasons none of our modern populations is stable from a hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population that has originated through migration will gradually become more homogeneous , if the descendants continue to reside in the same spot . In our cities and mixed farming communities , on account of changes in selective mating , constant changes in the hereditary composition are going on , even after immigration has ceased . Local inbreeding produces local types ; avoidance of marriages between near relatives favors increasing likeness of all the family lines constituting the population ; favored or proscribed cousin marriages which are customary among many tribes establish separate family types and increase in this sense the heterogeneity of the population . Another question presents itself . We have considered only the hereditary stability of genetic lines . We must ask ourselves also whether environmental conditions exert an influence over races . It is quite obvious that the forms of lower organisms are subject to environmental influences . Plants taken from low altitudes to high mountains develop short stems ; leaves of semi-aquatic plants growing under water have a form differing from the subaerial leaves . Cultivated plants transform their stamens into petals . Plants may be dwarfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is so organized that it develops a certain form under given environmental conditions . Microorganisms differ so much in different environmental settings that it is often difficult to establish their specific identity . The question arises whether the same kind of variability  | occurs in higher organisms . The general impression is that their forms are determined by heredity , not by environment . The young of a greyhound is a greyhound , that of a shorthorn a shorthorn ; that of a Norway rat a Norway rat . The child of a European is European in type , that of a Chinaman of Mongolic type , that of an African Negro a Negro . Nevertheless detailed study shows that the form and size of the body are not entirely shaped by heredity . Records of the stature of European men that date back to the middle of the past century show that in almost all countries the average statures have increased by more than an inch . It is true , this is not a satisfactory proof of an actual change , because improvement in public health has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not likely that this should be the cause of an increase in stature , it is conceivable . A better proof is found in the change of stature among descendants of Europeans w ! ' o settle in America . In this case it has been shown that in many nationalities the children are taller than their own parents , presumably on account of more favorable conditions of life . It has also been observed that the forms of Cie body are influenced by occupation . The hand of a person who has to do heavy manual labor differs from that of a musician who develops the independence of all the muscles of his hand . The proportions and form of the limb are influenced by habitual posture and use . The legs of the oriental who squats flat on the ground are somewhat modified by this habit . Other modifications can not be explained by better nutrition or by the use of the muscles . Forms of the head and face are not quite stable , but are in some way influenced by the environment in which the people live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child will not be quite like the parent . All the observed changes are slight and do not modify the essential character of the hereditary forms . Still they are . not negligible . We do not know how great the modifications may be that ultimately result from such changes , nor have  | we any evidence that the changes would persist if the people were taken back to their old environment . Although a Negro will never become a European , it is not impossible that some of the minor differences between European populations may be due to environment rather than to heredity . So far we have discussed solely the anatomical forms of races with a view of gaining a clearer understanding of what we mean by the term race . It may be well to repeat the principal result of our discussion . We have found that the term " racial heredity " is strictly applicable only when all the individuals of a race participate in certain anatomical features . In each race taken as a whole the family lines differ considerably in their hereditary traits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of lines similar or even identical in one or many respects occur in contiguous territories . The vague impression of " types , " abstracted from our everyday experience , does not prove that these are biologically distinct races , and the inference that various populations are composed of individuals belonging to various races is subjectively intelligible , objectively unproved . It is particularly not admissible to identify types apparently identical that occur in populations of different composition . Each individual can be understood only as a member of his group . These considerations seem necessary , because they clear up the vagueness of the term " race " as usually applied . When we speak of heredity we are ordinarily concerned with family lines , not with races . The hereditary qualities of families constituting the most homogeneous populations differ very much among themselves and there is very little , if anything , that these family lines have in common and they are not sharply set off from neighboring populations that may give a quite distinctive impression . The relation of racial types may be looked at in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types the identification of an individual as a member of each type can not be made with any degree of certainty . Nevertheless  | the distribution of individuals and of family lines in the various races differs . When we select among the Europeans a group with large brains , their frequency will be relatively high , while among the Negroes the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding group will be low . If , for instance , there are 50 per cent of an European population who have a brain weight of more than , let us say , 1,500 grams , there may be only 20 per cent of Negroes of the same class . Therefore 30 per cent of the large-brained Europeans can not be matched by any corresponding group of Negroes . It is justifiable to compare races from this point of view , as long as we avoid an application of our results to , in ? dividuals . On general biological grounds it is important to know whether any one of the human races is , in regard to form or function , further removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races can be arranged in an ascending series . Although we do not know the ancestral form with any degree of certainty , some of its characteristics can be inferred by a comparison of the anatomical forms of man and of the apes . Single traits can be brought into ascending series in which the racial forms differ more and more from animal forms , but the arrangement is a different one for each independent trait . The ancestral form had a flat nose . Bushmen , Negroes and Australians have flat , broad noses . Mongoloids , Europeans and particularly Armenians have narrow , prominent noses . They are in this sense farthest removed from the animal forms . Apes have narrow lips . The lips of the Whites are thin , those of many Mongoloid types are fuller . The Negroes have the thickest , most excessively " human " lips . The hair coat of apes is moderately strong . Among human races the Australians , Europeans and a few scattered tribes among other races have the amplest body hairs ; Mongols have the least . Similar remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot , of the spinal column , of the proportions of the limbs . The order of the degree to which human races differ from animals is not the same in regard to these traits . Particular stress has been laid on the brain , which also differs in various races . Setting aside the pygmy Bushmen and other very small races , the negroid races have smaller brains than the Mongoloids , and these in general smaller ones than the Europeans , although some Mongoloid types , like the Eskimo , exceed in size of the brain many European groups . The brain in each race is very variable in size and the " overlapping " of individuals in the races is marked . It is not possible to identify an individual as a Negro or White according to the size and form of the brain , but serially the Negro brain is less extremely human than that of the White . We are apt to identify the size of the brain with its functioning . This is true to a limited extent only . Among the higher mammals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have greater intelligence ; but size alone is not an adequate criterion . Complexity of structure is much more important than mere size . Some birds have brains much larger proportionately than those of the higher mammals without evidencing superior intelligence . The size of the brain is measured by its weight which does not depend upon the nerve cells and fibers alone , but includes a large amount of material that is not directly relevant for the functioning of the central nervous system . Superior intelligence in man is in a way related to size of the brain . Microcephalic individuals whose brains remain considerably under normal size are mentally defective , but an individual with an exceptionally large brain is not necessarily a genius . There are many causes that affect the size of the brain . The larger the body , the larger the brain . Therefore well-nourished people who have a larger bulk of body than those poorly nourished have larger brains , not because their brains are structurally more highly developed , but because the larger bulk is a characteristic feature of the  | - retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourished class and the cause of the greater brain is , therefore , uncertain . The variation in the size of the brain of eminent men is also very considerable , some falling way beneath the norm . The real problem to be solved is the relation between the structure of the brain and its function . The correlation between gross structure in the races of man and function is so slight that no safe inferences may be drawn on the basis of the slight differences between races which are of such character that up to this time the racial identification of a brain is impossible , except in so far as elongated and rounded heads , high and low heads and similar gross forms may be distinguished which do not seem to have any relation to minute structure or function . At least it has never been proved to exist and it does not seem likely that there is any kind of intimate relation . The differences between races are so small that they lie within the narrow range in the limits of which all forms may function equally well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains and nervous systems , that function noticeably worse than the norm , is the same in every race , nor that those of rare excellence are equally frequent . It iv not improbable that such differences may exist in the same . way as we find different ranges of adjustability in other organs . Without further proof the serial arrangement in brain size can not be identified with a higher racial intelligence . If the anatomical structure of the brain is a doubtful indication of mental excellence , this is still more the case with differences in other parts of the body . So far as we can judge the form of the foot and the slight development of the calves of the Negro ; the prominence of his teed- and the size of his lips ; the heaviness of the face of the Mongol ; or the difference in degree of pigmentation of the races nave no relation to mentality . At least every attempt to prove such relation has failed .  | In any attempt to place the human races u : ; evolutionary series we must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In regard to nutrition and artificial protection the mode of life of man is like that of domesticated animals . The artificial modification of food by the use of fire and the invention of tools were the steps that brought about the self-domestication of man . Both belong to a very early period , to a time before the last extensive glaciation of Europe . Man must be considered the oldest domesticated form . The most characteristic features of human races bear evidence of this . The loss of pigmentation in the blond , blue-eyed races ; the blackness of the hair of the Negro are traits that do not occur in any wild mammal form . Exceptions are the blackness of the hair coat of the black panther , of the black bear and of the subterranean mole . The frizzliness of the Negro hair and the curliness of the hair of the other races , the long hair of the head do not occur in wild mammals . The permanence rather than periodicity of the sexual functions and of the female breasts ; the anomalies of sexual behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestication of man is like that of the animals raised by primitive tribes that do not breed certain strains by selection . Nevertheless , forms differing from the wild forms develop in their herds . Some of the traits of man that might be considered as indicating a lower evolutionary stage may as well be due to domestication . Reduction or unusual lengthening of the face occurs . The excessive reduction of the face in some White types and the elongation of the mouth parts of the Negro may be due to this cause . It may be a secondary development from an intermediate form . The brain of domesticated forms is generally smaller than that of wild forms . In exceptional cases it may be larger . Pygmy forms and giants develop in domestication . In short , the " primitive traits " of races are not necessarily indications of an early  | arrest . They may be later acquisitions stabilized in domes. tication . All this , however , has little to do with the biologically determined mentality of races , which is often assumed to be the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physiological functioning of the body and the problem may be formulated as an investigation of the functioning of the body , in the widest sense of the term " functioning . " We have seen that the description of the anatomical traits of a race in general terms involves a faulty generalization based on the impression made by the majority of individuals , This is no less true in regard to the functions of a population . Our characterization of the mentality of a people is merely a conceptionalization of those traits that are found in a large number of individuals and that are , for this reason , impressive . In another population other traits impress themselves upon the mind and are conceptionalized . This does not prove that , if in a third population both types are found , it is mixed in its functional behavior . The objective value of generalizations of this type is not self-evident , because they are merely the result of the subjective construction of types , the wide variability of which is disregarded . Actually the functions exhibited by a whole race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits , because individually and in family lines the variations are so great that not all the members of the race react alike . When the body has completed its growth its features remain the same for a considerable length of time , ? until the changes due to old age set in . It does not matter at what time we examine the body , the results will always be nearly the same . Fluctuations of weight , of the amount of fat , of muscle do occur , but these are comparatively slight , and under normal conditions of health , nutrition and exercise insignificant until senility sets in . It is different with the functions of the body . The heart beat depends upon transient conditions . In sleep it is slow ;  | in waking , during meals , during exercise more rapid . The range of the number of heart beats for the individual is very wide . The condition of our digestive tract depends upon the amount and kind of food present ; our eyes act differently in intense light and in darkness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , the individuals constituting a population do not all function in the same way . Variability , which in regard to anatomical traits has only one source , namely , the differences between individuals , has in physiological functions an added source , the different behavior of the individual at different times . It is , therefore , not surprising that functionally the individuals composing a population exhibit a considerable variability . The average values expressing the functioning of various - aces living under the same conditions are not the same , but the differences are not great as compared to the variations that occur in each racial group . Investigations of the functioning of the same sense organs of various races , such as Whites , Indians , Filipinos and people of New Guinea , indicate that their sensitiveness is very much the same . The popular belief in an unusual keenness of eyesight or hearing of primitive people is not corroborated by careful observations . The impression is due to the training of their power of observation which is directed to phenomena with which we are not familiar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Whites and there are probably differences in the functioning of the digestive tract and of the skin between Whites and Negroes . Much remains to be done in the study of physiological functions of different races before we can determine the quantitative differences between them . The variability of many functions is well known . We referred before to the heart beat . Let us imagine an individual who lives in New York and leads a sedentary life without bodily exercise . Transport this person to the high alateaus of the Bolivian Andes where he has to do physical  | work . He will find difficulties for a while , but , if he is healthy , he will finally become adjusted to the new conditions . His normal heart beat , however , will have changed . His lungs also will act differently in the rarefied air . It is ' . the same individual who in the new environment will exhibit a quantitatively different functioning of the body . We pointed out before that environmental conditions cause in general but slight modification of anatomical form . Their effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case in lower organisms which are in bodily form subject to important modifications brought about by the environment . The functions of the organs are adjustable to different requirements . Every organ has ? to use Dr. Meltzer 's term ? a margin of safety . Within limits it can function normally according to environmental requirements . Even a partly disabled organ can be sufficient for the needs of the body . Inadequacy develops only when these limits are exceeded . There are certain conditions that are most favorable , but the loss of adequacy is very slight when the conditions change within the margins of safety . In most cases of the kind here referred to the environmental influence acts upon different individuals in the same direction . If we bring two organically different individuals into the same environment they may , therefore , become alike in their functional responses and we may gain the impression of a functional likeness of distinct anatomical forms that is due to environment , not to their internal structure . Only in those cases in which the environment acts with different intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we expect increased unlikeness under the same environmental conditions . When , for instance , for one individual the margin of safety is so narrow that the environmental conditions are excessive , for another one so wide that adequate adjustment is possible , the forme ; will become sick , while the other will remain healthy . What is true of the physiological functioning of the hod 's is still more true of mental reactions . A simple example may  | illustrate this . When we are asked to react to a stimulus , for instance by tapping in response to a signal given by a bell , we can establish a certain basal or minimum time interval between signal and tapping which is found when we are rested and concentrate our attention upon the signal . As soon as we are tired and when our attention is distracted the time increases . We may even become so much absorbed in other matters that the signal will go unnoticed . Environmental conditions determine the reaction time . The basal time for two individuals may differ quite considerably , still under varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the conditions of life compel the one to concentrate his attention while the other has never been required to do so , they may react in the same way , although structurally they represent different types . In more complex mental and social phenomena this adjustment of different types to a common standard is of frequent occurrence . The pronunciation of individuals in a small community is so uniform that an expert ear can identify the home of a person by his articulation . Anatomically the forms of the mouth , inner nose and larynx of all the individuals participating in this pronunciation vary considerably . The mouth may be large or small , the tongue thin or thick , the palate arched or flat . There are differences in the pitch of the voice and in timbre . Still the dialect will be the same for all . The articulation does not depend to any considerable extent upon the form of the mouth , but upon its use . In all our everyday habits imitation of habits of the society to which we belong exerts its influence over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformity of thought and action is brought about among individuals who differ considerably in structure . It would not be justifiable to claim that bodily form has no relation whatever to physiological or mental functioning . I do not believe that Watson is right when he claims that he whole mental activities of man are due to his individual  | experiences and that what is called character or ability i due to outer conditions , not to organic structure . It seems to me that this goes counter to the observation of mental activities in the animal world as well as among men . The mental activities of a family of idiots will not , even under the most favorable conditions , equal those of a highly intelligent family , and what is true in eliminate environmental influences that bring about similarity or dissimilarity , it seems unreasonable to assume that in the mental domain organically determined sameness of all individuals should exist while in all other traits we do find differences ; but we must admit that the organic differences are liable to be overlaid and overshadowed by environmental influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certainty the hereditary traits in mental behavior . In a well-integrated society we find people of most diverse descent who all react so much in the same way that it is impossible to tell from their reactions alone to what race they belong . Individual differences and those belonging to family lines occur in such a society , but among healthy individuals these are so slightly correlated to bodily form that an identification of an individual on the basis of his functions as belonging to a family or race of definite hereditary functional qualities is also impossible . In this case , even more than in that of anatomical form , , the range of variation of hereditary lines constituting a ; " race " is so wide that the same types of lines may be found in different races . While so far as anatomical form is concerned Negroes and Whites have racially hereditary traits , this is not true of function . The mental life of each of the individuals constituting these races is so varied that from its expression alone an individual can not be assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to a few races , like the Bushmen of South Africa , we have no evidence in regard to this point , and we may suspend judgment , al .  | Though I do not anticipate that any fundamental differences will be found . So far as our experience goes we may safely say that in any given race the differences between family lines are much greater than the differences between races . It may happen that members of one family line , extreme in form and function , are quite different from those of a family line of the opposite extreme , although both belong to the same race ; while it may be very difficult to find individuals or family lines in one racial type that may not be duplicated in a neighboring type . The assumption of fundamental , hereditary mental characteristics of races is often based on an analogy with the mental traits of races of domesticated animals . Certainly the mentality of the poodle dog is quite different from that of the bulldog , or that of a race horse from that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the races of domesticated animals are comparable to family lines , not to human races . They are developed by carefully controlled inbreeding . Their family lines are uniform , those of man diverse . They are parallel to the family lines that occur in all human races , which , however , do not become stabilized on account of the lack of rigid inbreeding . In this respect human races must be compared to wild animals , not to selected , domesticated breeds . All these considerations are apparently contradicted by the results of so-called intelligence tests which are intended to determine innate intellectuality . Actually these tests show considerable differences not only between individuals but 14 also between racial and social groups . The test is an expression of mental function . Like other functions the responses to mental tests show overlapping of individuals belonging to different groups and ordinarily it is not possible to assign an individual to his proper group according to his response . The test itself shows only that a task set to a person can  | be performed by him more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of organically determined intelligence is an assumption that has to be proved . Deirctive individuals can not perform certain acts required in the tests . Within narrower limits of performance we must ask in how far the structure of the organism , in how far outer , environmental conditions may determine the result of the test . Since all functions are strongly influenced by environment it is likely that here also environmental influences may prevail and obscure the structurally determined part of the reaction . Let us illustrate this by an example . One of the simplest tests consists in the task of fitting blocks of various forms into holes of corresponding forms . There are primitive people who devote much time to decorative work in which fitting of forms plays an important part . It may be applique work , mosaic , or stencil work . Others have no experience whatever in the use of forms . We have no observations on these people , but it seems more than likely that those who are accustomed to handling varied forms and to recognize them , will respond to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such experience . Dr. Klineberg has investigated the reactions to simple tests of various races living under very different conditions . He found that all races investigated by him respond under city conditions quickly and inaccurately , that the same races in remote country districts react slowly and more accurately . The hurry and pressure for efficiency of city life result in a different attitude that has nothing to do with innate intelligence , but is an effect of a cultural condition . An experiment made in Germany , but based on entirely different sets of tests , has had a similar result . Children be . longing to different types of schools were tested . The social groups attending elementary schools and higher schools of various types differ in their cultural attitudes . It is unlikely that they belong by descent to different racial groups . On the contrary , the population as a whole is uniform . The  | responses in various schools were quite different . There is no particular reason why we should assume a difference in organic structure between the groups and it seems more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differentiation . In all tests based on language the effect of the linguistic experience of the subject plays an important part . Our whole sense experience is classified according to linguistic principles and our thought is deeply influenced by the classification of our experience . Often the scope of a concept expressed by a word determines the current of our thought and the categories which the grammatical form of the language compels us to express keep certain types of modality or connection before our minds . When lingua. compels me to differentiate sharply between elder ancl. younger brother , between father 's brother and mother 's brother , directions of thought that our vaguer terms permit will be excluded . When the terms for son and brother 's son are not distinguished the flow of thought may run in currents unexpected to us who differentiate clearly between these terms . When a language states clearly in every case the forms of objects , as round , long or flat ; or the instrumentality with which an action is done , as with the hand , with a knife , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as observed , known by evidence or by hearsay , these forms may establish lines of association . Comparison of reactions of individuals that speak fundamentally distinct languages may , therefore , express the influence of language upon the current of thought , not any innate difference in the form of thought . All these considerations cause us to doubt whether it is possible to differentiate between environmental and organic determination of responses , as soon as the environment of two individuals is different . It is exceedingly difficult to secure an identical environment even in our own culture . Every home , every street , every family group and school has its own character which  | is difficult to evaluate . In large masses of individuals we may assume a somewhat equal environmental setting for a group in similar economic and social position , and it is justifiable to assume in this case that the variability of environmental influence is much restricted that organically determined differences between individuals appear more clearly . Just as soon as we compare different social groups the relative uniformity of social background disappears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent , there is a strong probability that differences in the type of re . sponse are primarily due to the effect of environment rather than to organic differences between the groups . The responses to tests may be based on recognition of sensory impressions , on motor experience , such as the results of complex movements ; or on the use of acquired knowledge . All of these contain experience . A city boy who has been brought up by reading , familiar with the conveniences of city life , accustomed to the rush of traffic and the watchfulness demanded on the streets has a general setting entirely different from that of a boy brought up on a lonely farm , who has had no contact with the machinery of modern city life . His sense experience , motor habits and the currents of his thoughts differ from those of the city boy . Certainly in none of the tests that have ever been applied is individual experience eliminated and I doubt that it can be done . We must remember how we acquire the manner of acting and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our environment and our behavior in later years is determined by what we learn as infants and children . The responses to any stimulus depend upon these early habits . Individually it may be influenced by organic , hereditary conditions . In the large mass of a population these vary . In a homogeneous social group the experience gained in childhood is fairly uniform , so that its influence will be more marked than that of organic structure . The dilemma of the investigator appears clearly in th  | results or mental tests taken on Negroes of Louisiana and Chicago . During the World War the enlisted men belonging to the two groups were tested and showed quite distinct responses . There is no very great difference in the pigmentation of the two groups . Both are largely mulattoes . The Northern Negroes passed the tests much more successfully than those from the South . Chicago Negroes are accustomed to city surroundings . They work with Whites and are accustomed to a certain degree of equality , owing to similarity of occupation and constant contact . All these are lacking among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more energetic and intelligent group of Negroes has migrated to the city and that the weak and unintelligent stay behind , and to disregard the effect of social environment . We know that the environment is distinct and that human behavior is strikingly modified by it . We do not know that selection plays an important part in the migration of the Southern Negro to Northern cities . It is quite arbitrary to ascribe the difference in mental behavior solely to the latter , doubtful cause and to disregard the former entirely . Those who claim that there is an organic difference must prove it by showing the difference between the two groups before their migration . Even if it were true that selection accounts for the differences in the responses to tests among these two groups , it would not have any bearing upon the problem of racial characteristics , for we should have here merely a selection of better endowed individuals or family lines , all belonging to the same race , a condition similar to the often quoted , but never proved , result of the emigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remain , whether there is any difference in racial composition in the two ; groups . So far as we know the amount of Negro and White blood in the two groups is about the same . Other tests intended to investigate differences between the mental reactions of Negroes , Mulattoes , and Whites due to the racial composition of the groups are not convincing ,  | because due caution has not been taken to insure an equal social background . The study of mental achievement of a socially uniform group undertaken by Dr. Herskovits does not show any relation between the intensity of negroid features and mental attainment . Up to this time none of the mental tests gives us any insight into significant racial differences that might not be adequately explained by the effect of social experience . Even Dr. Woodworth 's observations on the Filipino pygmies are not convincing , because the cultural background of the groups tested is unknown , A critical examination of all studies of this type in which differences between racial groups in regard to mental reactions are demonstrated , leaves us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent . We must emphasize again that differences between selected groups of the same descent , such as between poor orphan children often of defective parentage , and of normal children ; and those between unselected groups of individuals representing various races are phenomena quite distinct in character . In the former case the results of tests may express differences in family lines . Similar peculiarities might be found , although with much greater difficulty , when comparing small inbred communities , for inbred communities are liable to differ in social behavior . For large racial groups acceptable proof of marked mental differences due to organic , not social , causes has never been given . Students of ethnology have always been so much impressed by the general similarity of fundamental traits of human culture that they have never found it necessary to take into account the racial descent of a people when discussing its culture . This is true of all schools of modern ethnology . Edward B. Tylor and Herbert Spencer in their studies of the evolution of culture , Adolf Bastian in his insistence on the sameness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratzel , who followed the historical dissemination of cultural forms ? they all have carries on their work without any regard to race . The  | general experience of ethnology indicates that whatever differences there may be between the great races are insignificant when considered in their effect upon cultural life . It does not matter from which point of view we consider culture , its forms are not dependent upon race . In economic life and in regard to the extent of their inventions the Eskimos , the Bushmen and the Australians may well be compared . The position of the Magdalenian race , which lived at the end of the ice age , is quite similar to that of the Eskimo . On the other hand , the complexities of inventions and of economic life of the Negroes of the Sudan , of the ancient Pueblos , of our early European ancestors who used stone tools , and of the early Chinese are comparable . In the study of material culture we are constantly compelled to compare similar inventions used by people of the most diverse descent . Devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Islands and America ; games of Africa and Asia ; blowguns of Malaysia and South America ; decorative designs from almost every continent ; musical instruments from Asia , the Pacific islands and America ; head rests from Africa and Melanesia ; the beginning of the art of writing in America and in the Old World ; the use of the zero in America , Asia and Europe ; the use of bronze , of methods of firemaking , from all parts of the world can not be studied on the basis of their distribution by races , but only by their geographical and historical distribution , or as independent achievements , without any reference to the bodily forms of the races using these inventions . Other aspects of cultural life are perhaps still more impressive , because they characterize the general cultural life more deeply than inventions : the use of standards of value in Africa , America , Asia , Europe and on the islands of the Pacific Ocean ; analogous types of family organization , such as small families , or extended sibs with maternal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives ; the exclusion of women from sacred ceremonials ; the forma-  | tion of age societies ; all these are found in fundamentally similar forms among all races . In their study we are compelled to disregard the racial position of the people we study , for similarities and dissimilarities have no relation whatever to racial types . It does not matter how the similar traits in diverse races may have originated , by diffusion or independent origin . They convince us of the independence of race and culture because their distribution does not follow racial lines ,  | LANGUAGE has a setting . The people that speak it belong to a race ( or a number of races ) , that is , to a group which is set off by physical characteristics from other groups . Again , language does not exist apart from culture , that is , from the socially inherited assemblage of practices and beliefs that determines the texture of our lives . Anthropologists have been in the habit of studying man under the three rubrics of race , language , and culture . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Africa or the South Seas is to map it out from this threefold point of view . These maps answer the questions : What and where are the major divisions of the human animal , biologically considered ( e.g. , Congo Negro , Egyptian White ; Australian Black , Polynesian ) ? What are the most inclusive linguistic grouping , the " linguistic stocks , " and what is the distribution of each ( e.g. , the Hamitic language of northern Africa , the Bantu languages of the south ; the Malayo-Polynesian languages of Indonesia , Melanesia , Micronesia , and Polynesia ) ? How do the peoples of the given area divide themselves as cultural beings ? what are the outstanding " cultural areas " and what are the dominant ideas in each ( e.g. , the Mohammedan north of Africa ; the primitive hunting , non-agricultural culture of the Bushmen in the south ; the culture of the Australian natives , poor in physical respects but richly developed in ceremonialism ; the more advanced and highly specialized culture of Polynesia ) ? The man in the street does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity . He feels that he is the footnote * Language . New York : Harcourt , Brace &; Co.  | representative of some strongly integrated portion of humanity ? now thought of as a " nationality , " now as a " race " ? and that everything that pertains to him as a typical representative of this large group somehow belongs together . If he is an Englishman , he feels himself to be a member of the " Anglo-Saxon " race , the " genius " of which race has fashioned the English language and the " Anglo-Saxon " culture of which the language is the expression . Science is colder . It inquires if these three types of classification ? racial , linguistic , and cultural ? are congruent , if their association is an inherently necessary one or is merely a matter of external history . The answer to the inquiry is not encouraging to " race " sentimentalists . Historians and anthropologists find that races , languages , and cultures are rat distributed in parallel fashion , that their areas of distribution intercross in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each is apt to follow a distinctive course . Races intermingle in a way that languages do not . On the other hand , languages may spread far beyond their original home , invading the territory of new races and of new culture spheres . A language may even die out in its primary area and live on among peoples violently hostile to the persons of its original speakers . Further , the accidents of history are constantly rearranging the borders of culture areas without necessarily effacing the existing linguistic cleavages . If we can once thoroughly convince ourselves that race , in its only intelligible , that is , biological , sense , is supremely indif ? ferent to the history of languages and cultures , that these are no more directly explainable on the score of race than on that of the laws of physics and chemistry , we shall have gained a viewpoint that allows a certain interest to such mystic slogans as Slavophilism , Anglo-Saxondom , Teutonism , and the Latin genius but that quite refuses to be taken in by any of them . A careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributions is one of the driest of commentaries on these sentimental creeds . That a group of languages need not in the least cor  | respond to a racial group or a culture area is easily demonstrated . We may even show how a single language in tercrosses with race and culture lines . The English language is not spoken by a unified race . In the United States there are several millions of Negroes who know no other language . It is their mother-tongue , the formal vesture of their inmost thoughts and sentiments . It is as much their property , as inalienably " theirs , " as the King of England 's . Nor do the English-speaking whites of America constitute a definite race except by way of contrast to the Negroes . Of the three fundamental white races in Europe generally recognized by physical anthropologists ? the Baltic or North European , the Alpine , and the Mediterranean ? each has numerous English-speaking representatives in America . But does not the historical core of English-speaking peoples , those relatively " unmixed " populations that still reside in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and single ? I can not see that the evidence points that way . The English people Ire an amalgam of many distinct strains . Besides the old " Anglo-Saxon , " in other words North German , element which is conventionally represented as the basic strain , the English blood comprises Norman French , ' Scandinavian , " Celtic , " 2 and pre-Celtic elements . If by " English " we mean also Scotch and Irish , 3 then the term " Celtic " is loosely used for at least two quite distinct racial elements ? the short , dark-complexioned type of Wales and the taller , lighter , often ruddy-haired type of the Highlands and parts of Ireland . Even if we confine ourselves to the Saxon element , which , needless to say , nowhere appears " pure , " we are not at the end of our troubles . We may roughly identify this strain with the racial type now predominant in southern Denmark and adjoining parts of northern Germany . If so , we must content ourselves with the reflection that while the English language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree with the other West Germanic dialects ( Low Saxon or " Plattdeutsch , " Dutch , High German ) , only in third degree with Scandinavian , the specific  | " Saxon " racial type that overran England in the fifth and sixth centuries was largely the same as that now represented by the Danes , who speak a Scandinavian language , while the High German-speaking population of central and southern Germany is markedly distinct . But what if we ignore these finer distinctions and simply assume that the " Teutonic " or Baltic or North European racial type coincided in its distribution with that of the Germanic languages ? Are we not on safe ground then ? No , we are now in hotter water than ever . First of all , the mass of the German-speaking population ( central and southern Germany , German Switzerland , German Austria ) do not belong to the tall , blond-haired , long-headed " Teutonic " race at all , but to the shorter , darker-complexioned , short-headed ? Alpine race , of which the central population of France , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , Bohemians and Poles ) are equally good representatives . The distribution of these " Alpine " populations corresponds in part to that of the old continental " Celts , " whose language has everywhere given way to Italic , Germanic , and Slavic pressure . We shall do well to avoid speaking of a " Celtic race , " but if we were driven to give the term a content , it would probably be more appro. priate to apply it to , roughly , the western portion of the Alpine peoples than to the two island types that I referred to before . These latter were certainly " Celticized , " in speech and , partly , in blood , precisely as , centuries later , most of England and part of Scotland was " Teutonized " by the Angles and Saxons . Linguistically speaking , the " Celts " of to-day ( Irish Gaelic , Manx , Scotch Gaelic , Welsh , Breton ) are Celtic and most of the Germans of to-day are Germanic precisely as the American Negro , Americanized Jew , Minnesota Swede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly , the Baltic race was , and is , by no means an exclusively Germanic-speaking people . The northernmost " Celt , " such as the Highland Scotch , are in all probability a specialized offshoot of this race . What these people spoke before  | they were Celticized nobody knows , but there is nothing whatever to indicate that they spoke a Germanic language . Their language may quite well have been as remote from any known Indo-European idiom as are Basque and Turkish to-day . Again , to the east of the Scandinavians are nonGermanic members of the race ? the Finns and related peoples , speaking languages that are not definitely known to be related to Indo-European at all . We can not stop here . The geographical position of the Germanic languages is such as to make it highly probable that they represent but an outlying transfer of an IndoEuropean dialect ( possibly a Celto-Italic prototype ) to a Baltic people speaking a language or a group of languages that was alien to Indo-European . ' Not only , then , is English not spoken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely than not , was originally a foreign language to the race with which English is more particularly associated . We need not seriously entertain the idea that English or the group of languages to which it belongs is in any intelligible sense the expression of race , that there are embedded in it qualities that reflect the temperament or " genius " of a particular breed of human beings . Many other , and more striking , examples of the lack of correspondence between race and language could be given if space permitted . One instance will do for many . The Malayo-Polynesian languages form a well-defined group that takes in the southern end of the Malay Peninsula and the tremendous island world to the south and east ( except Australia and the greater part of New Guinea ) . In this vast region we find represented no less than three distinct races ? the Negro-like Papuans of New Guinea and Melanesia , the Malay race of Indonesia , and the Polynesians of the outer islands . The Polynesians and Malays all speak languages of the Malayo-Polynesian group , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Melanesian ) , partly to the unrelated languages ( " Papuan " ) of New Guinea ' In spite of the fact that the greatest race cleavage in this  | region lies between the Papuans and the Polynesians , the major linguistic division is of Malayan on the one side , Melanesian and Polynesian on the other . As with race , so with culture . Particularly in more primitive levels , where the secondarily unifying power of the " national " 10 ideal does not arise to disturb the flow of what we might call natural distributions , is it easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated . Totally unrelated languages share in one culture , closely related languages ? even a single language ? belong to distinct culture spheres . There are many excellent examples to aboriginal America . The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified , as structurally specialized , a group as any that I know of.1 ' The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas ? the simple hunting culture of western Canada and the interior of Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plains ( Sarcee ) , the highly ritualized culture of the southwest ( Navaho ) , and the peculiarly specialized culture of northwestern California ( Hupa ) . The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves . The Hupa Indians are very typical of the culture area to which they belong . Culturally identical with them are the neighboring Yurok and Karok . There is the liveliest intertribal intercourse between the Huila , Yurok , and Karok , so much so that all three generally attend an important religious ceremony given by any one of them . It is difficult to say what elements in their combined culture belong in origin to this tribe or that , so much at one are they in communal action , feeling , and thought . But their languages are not merely alien to each other ; they Moll ; to three of the ma:or American linguistic groups , each with an immense distribution on the northern continent . Hupa , as we have seen , is Athabaskan and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Char , lotte Islands ) and Tlingit ( southern Alaska ) ; Yurok is one of the two isolated Californian languages of the Algon-  | kin stock , the center of gravity of which lies in the region of the Great Lakes ; Karok is the northernmost member of the Hokan group , which stretches far to the south beyond the confines of California and has remoter relatives along the Gulf of Mexico . Returning to English , most of us would readily admit , I believe , that the community of language between Great Britain and the United States is far from arguing a like community of culture . It is customary to say that they possess a common " Anglo-Saxon " cultural heritage , but are not many significant differences in life and feeling obscured by the tendency of the " cultured " to take this common heritage too much for granted ? In so far as America is still specifically " English , " it is only colonially or vestigially so ; its prevailing cultural drift is partly towards autonomous and distinctive developments , partly towards immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a particular facet . We can not deny that the possession of a common language is still and will long continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual cultural understanding between England and America , but it is very clear that other factors , some of them rapidly cumulative , are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence . A common language can not indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when geographical , political , and economic determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout its area . Language , race , and culture are not necessarily correlated . This does not mean that they never are . There is one tendency , as a matter of fact , for racial and cultural lines of cleavage to correspond to linguistic ones , though in any given case the latter may not be of the same degree of importance as the others . Thus , there is a fairly definite line of cleavage between the Polynesian languages , race , and culture on the one hand and those of the Melanesians on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The racial and cultural divisions , however , particularly the  | former , are of major importance , while the linguistic division is of quite minor significance , the Polynesian languages con. stituting hardly more than a special dialectic subdivision of the combined Melanesian-Polynesian group . Still clearer . cut coincidences of cleavage may be found . The language , race , and culture of the Eskimo are markedly distinct from those of their neighbors ; 13 in southern Africa the language , race , and culture of the Bushmen offer an even stronger contrast to those of their Bantu neighbors . Coincidences or this sort are of the greatest significance , of course , but this significance is not one of inherent psychological relation between the three factors of race , language , and culture . The coincidences of cleavage point merely to a readily intelligible historical association . If the Bantu and Bushmen are so sharply differentiated in all respects , the reason is simply that the former are relatively recent arrivals in southern Africa . The two peoples developed in complete isolation from each other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultural and racial assimilation to have set in very powerfully . As we go back in time , we shall have to assume that relatively scanty populations occupied large territories for untold generations and that contact with other masses of population was not as insistent and prolonged as it later became . The geographical and historical isolation that brought about race differentiations was naturally favorable also to far-reaching variations in language and culture . The very fact that races and cultures which are brought into historical contact tend to assimilate in the long run , while neighboring languages assimilate each other only casually and in superficial respects , 14 indicates that there is no profound causal relation between the development of language and the specific development of race and of culture . But surely , the wary reader will object , there must be some relation between language and culture , and between language and at least that intangible aspect'of race that we call " temperament- " Is , it not inconcei " ahle that the particular  | collective qualities of mind that have fashioned a culture are not precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular linguistic morphology ? This question takes us into the heart of the most difficult problems of social psychology . It is doubtful if any one has yet attained to sufficient clarity on the nature of the historical process and on the ultimate psychological factors involved in linguistic and cultural drifts to answer intelligently . I can only very brieflq set forth . ny own views , or rather my general attitude . It would be very difficult to prove that " temperament , " the general emotional disposition of a people , 15 is basically responsible for the slant and drift of a culture , however much it may manifest itself in an individual 's handling of the elements of that culture . But granted that temperament has a certain value for the shaping of culture , difficult though it be to say just how , it does not follow that it has the same value for the shaping of language . It is impossible to show that the form of a language has the slightest connection with national temperament . Its line of variation , its drift , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antecedents ; it is as regardless of the feelings and sentiments of its speakers as is the course of a river of the atmospheric humors of the landscape . I am convinced that it is futile to look in linguistic structure for differences corresponding to the temperamental variations which are supposed to be correlated with race . In this connection it is well to remember that the emotional aspect of our psychic life is but meagerly expressed in the build of language . Language and our thought-grooves are inextricably interwoven , are , in a sense , one and the same . As there is nothing to show that there are significant racial differences in the fundamental conformation of thought , it follows that the infinite variability of linguistic form , another name for the infinite variability of the actual process of thought , can not be an index of such significant racial differences . This is only apparently a paradox . The latent content of all languages is the same ? the intuitive science of experience . It is  | the manifest form that is never twice the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing more or less than a collective art of thought , an art denuded of the irrelevancies of individual sentiment . At last analysis , then , language can no more flow from race as such than can the sonnet form . Nor can I believe that culture and language are in any true sense causally related . Culture may be defined as what a society does and thinks . Language is a particular how of thought . It is difficult to see what particular causal relations may be expected to subsist between a selected inventory of experience ( culture , a significant selection made by society ) and the particular manner in which the society expresses all experience . The drift of culture , another way of saying history , is a complex series of changes in society 's selected inventory ? additions , losses , changes of emphasis and relation . The drift of language is not properly concerned with changes of content at all , merely with changes in formal expression . It is possible , in thought , to change every sound , word , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least , just as one can pour into a fixed mold water or plaster or molten gold . If it can be shown that culture has an innate form , a series of contours , quite apart from subject-matter of any description whatsoever , we have a something in culture that may serve as a term of comparison with and possibly a means of relating it to language . But until such purely formal patterns of culture are discovered and laid bare , we shall do well to hold the drifts of language and of culture to be non-comparable and unrelated processes . From this it follows that all attempts to connect particular types of linguistic morphology with certain correlated stages of cultural development are vain . Rightly understood , such correlations are rubbish . The merest coup d'ceil verifies our theoretical argument on this point . Both simple and complex types of language of an indefinite number of varieties may be found spoken at any desired level of cultural advance . When if  | comes to linguistic form , Plato walks with the Macedonian swineherd , Confucius with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mere content of language is intimately related to culture . A society that has no knowledge of theosophy need have no name for it ; aborigines that had never seen or heard of a horse were compelled to invent or borrow a word for the animal when they made his acquaintance . In the sense that the vocabulary of a language more or less faithfully reflects the culture whose purposes it serves it is perfectly true that the history of language and the history of culture move along parallel lines . But this superficial and extraneous kind of parallelism is of no real interest to the linguist except in so far as the growth or borrowing of new words incidentally throws light on the formal trends of the language . The linguistic student should never make the mistake of identifying a language with its dictionary . There is perhaps no better way to learn the essential nature of speech than to realize what it is not and what it does not do . Its superficial connections with other historic processes are so close that it needs to be shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own right . Everything that we have so far seen to be true of language points to the fact that it is the most significant and colossal work that the human spirit has evolved ? nothing short of a finished form of expression for all communicable experience . This form may be endlessly varied by the individual without thereby losing its distinctive contours ; and it is constantly reshaping itself as is all art . Language is the most massive and inclusive art we know , a mountainous and anonymous work of unconscious generations . NOTES 1Itself an amalgam of North " French " and Scandinavian elements . 2 The " Celtic " blood of what is now England and Wales is by no means confined to the Celtic-speaking regions ? Wales and , until recently , Cornwall . There is every reason to believe that the invading Germanic tribes  | ( Angles , Saxons , Jutes ) did not exterminate the Brythonic Celts of Eng land nor yet drive them altogether into Wales and Cornwall ( there has been far too much " driving " of conquered peoples into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but simply intermingled with them and imposed their rule and language upon them . 3 In practice these three peoples can hardly be kept altogether distinct . The terms have rather a local-sentimental than a clearly racial value . Intermarriage has gone on steadily for centuries and it is only in certain outlying regions that we get relatively pure types , e.g. , the Highland Scotch of the Hebrides . In America , English , Scotch , and Irish strands have become inextricably interwoven . The High German now spoken in northern Germany is not of great age , but is due to the spread of standardized German , based on Upper Saxon , a High German dialect , at the expense of " Plattdeutsch . " " Dolichocephalic. " 6 " Brachycephalic . " By working back from such data as we possess we can make it prob . able that these languages were originally confined to a comparatively small area in northern Germany and Scandinavia . This area is clearly marginal to the total area of distribution of the Indo-European-speaking peoples . Their center of gravity , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8 While this is only a theory , the technical evidence for it is stronger than one might suppose . There are a surprising number of common and characteristic Germanic words which can not be connected with known Indo-European radical elements and which may well be survivals of the hypothetical pre-Germanic language ; such are house , stone , sea , wife ( German Haus , Stein , See , Weib ) . fi Only the easternmost part of this island is occupied by Melanesianspeaking Papuans. 10 A " nationality " is a major , sentimentally unified , group . The historical factors that lead to the feeling of national unity are various political , cultural , linguistic , geographic , sometimes specifically religious . ' Prue racial factors also may enter in , though the accent on " race " has generally a psychological rather than a strictly biological value . In an area dominated by the national sentiment there is a tendency for language and culture to become uniform and specific , so that linguistic and cultural boundaries at least tend to coincide . Even at best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultural unity is apt to be superficial , of a quasi-political nature , rather than deep and far-reaching . 11 The Semitic languages , idiosyncratic as they are , are no more deft , nitely ear-marked. 12 The Fijians , for instance , while of Papuan ( negroid ) race , are Polynesian rather than Melanesian in their cultural and linguistic affinities . 13 Though even here there is some significant overlapping . The southernmost Eskimo of Alaska were assimilated in culture to their Tlingit neighbors . In northeastern Siberia , too , there is no sharp cultural line between the Eskimo and the Chukchi. 14 The supersession of one language by another is of course not truly a matter of linguistic assimilation . 16 " Temperament " is a difficult term to work with . A great deal of  | what is loosely charged to national " temperament " is really nothing but ' customary behavior , the effect of traditional ideals of conduct . In a cub . dare , for instance , that does not look kindly upon demonstrativeness , the natural tendency to the display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite misleading to argue from the customary inhibition , a cultural fact , to the native temperament . But ordinarily we can get at human conduct only as it is culturally modified . Temperament in the raw is a highly elusive thing .  | THE purpose of the present work is to discuss a historical phenomenon that has hitherto been regarded by few and which no one has as yet fully examined . Students of antiquity fail to mention the matriarchy . The very word is new , as is the type of family life to which it refers . We not only lack extensive preparatory work , but to date no investigator has made any effort to interpret that stage of civilization to which the matriarchy belongs . In discussing it , we are , therefore , entering upon entirely unexplored ground . This study will lead us from the known ages of antiquity into earlier periods and from the world of ideas that has been so familiar to us in the past into an older milieu , wholly unknown . Those peoples with whose names the greatness of antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others , who never attained the heights of classical culture , occupy their places . An unknown world is suddenly revealed to us . And , the farther we penetrate into this world , the more strange does everything about us become . Everywhere we meet antitheses to the ideas of an advanced civilization , everywhere older views , for we are entering into an era with a character of its own and a morality that can be judged only on the basis of its own principles . The gynacocratic law of the family is strange not only when we view it . The Ancients already looked upon it as peculiar . Beside the Hellenic form of life that older law to which the matriarchy belongs , from which it has proceeded , and by which alone it can be explained , footnote * Das Mutterrecht . The material here reproduced was translated by Frida Ilmer.  | seems strange , indeed . It will be the aim of the following investigation to present the vital principle underlying this gynxcocratic epoch . I wish to show it in its true relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the more advanced on the other . I fully realize that I have set myself a task that is more inclusive than the title I have chosen would indicate . It will extend to all phases of gynxcocratic ethics , illuminating both its individual traits and the fundamental principle uniting them . Thus I hope to reconstruct the picture of a stage of culture that has been arrested , and in places even completley halted , by the advance of the classical era . My aim may seem too ambitious . But only by thus expanding our vision to its widest limits is it possible to gain true understanding and to extend the scientific idea with that clarity and precision which constitute the essence of knowledge . Of all reports that testify to the existence of the matriarchy in its intrinsic form , those concerning the Lykians are the clearest and most valuable . The Lykians , so reports Herodotus , named their children not after their fathers , as did the Hellenes , but after their mothers . In all genealogical reports they stressed only the maternal line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that of its mother . Nicholas of Damascus strengthened this statement by calling attention to the exclusive inheritance rights of daughters . These rights he traced back to a traditional law of the Lykians , that is , an unwritten law , which , according to Socrates ' definition must be regarded as given by the gods themselves . Although Herodotus sees in them nothing more than a strange deviation from Hellenic custom , the observation of their inner unity must lead us to a profounder interpretation . What we meet is not incoherent , but systematic ; it is not arbitrary , but seems to have arisen from necessity . Since , in addition , any influence of a written law-code is emphatically denied , the assumption that these customs represent but an insignificant anomaly , loses its last semblance 4 justification . The Hellenic-Roman father principle is  | hereby contrasted with a code of family ethics that is its direct opposite both in its fundamental principles and in their resultant development . This concept is further affirmed by the discovery of similar codes among other races . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters alone are responsible for the support of their aged parents . This corresponds well to the exclusive inheritance rights of the Lykians . But even though this practice seems to complete the Lykian system , a report of Strabo 's concerning the Cantabrians leads us to still further variants of the same principle . Among the Cantabrians , so Strabo reports , brothers are elocated and equipped with dowries by their sisters . In addition to presenting a remarkably complete picture , these facts also justify the assumption that the matriarchy is not merely an unusual development peculiar to one nation , but is characteristic of an entire cultural stage . Granted the uniformity of human nature , we must conclude that the matriarchy is not conditioned nor limited by racial ' lines . Finally , we must turn our attention not so much to . the internal harmony prevailing in the various forms dis covered , as to the identity of the fundamental idea governing the entire system . To this series of general facts the Polybrian reports concerning the ioo aristocratic Locrian families which are characterized by maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and significance of which will be proven in the course of this investigation . The matriarchy belongs to an earlier stage of civilization than the patriarchal system and its full and unlimited strength crumbled before victorious paternity . That this was so is corroborated by the fact that the gynxcocratic forms of society are found principally among those nations that are older than the Hellenic peoples . They are an essential part of that original culture whose peculiarities are as closely linked up with the predominance of the matriarchy as Hellenism is with the rule of the father .  | The marked coherence evidenced by gynxcocratic culture points clearly to the existence of one governing principle , whose every outward expression is of the same substance . They suggest a self-sufficient stage in the development of the human mind . The dominance of the maternal element can not be conceived of as an individual phenomenon . Such a morality , for instance , as that displayed by the Hellenic civilization at its height , can not be associated with it . The same contrast that governs the patriarchal and matriarchal principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cultures . The consistency of the gynxcocratic principle is borne out in the preference of the left over the right , commonly found among matriarchic peoples . The left direction belongs . to the passive nature of woman , while the right is characteristic of the active male . To clarify this point , we need but recall the part which the left hand of Isis plays in the Nile region , one of the strongholds of matriarchy . Once we have become aware of this tendency , other facts soon appear in great numbers , testifying to its significance and universality , and assuring its freedom from philosophic speculation . In manners and usages of civil life as well as of ritual , in peculiarities of garment as well as of hairdress , no less than in the meaning of certain idiomatic turns of speech , the same fundamental principle finds repeated expression . It is the principle of the major honos hevarum partium , closely associated with the matriarchy . By no means less significant is a second expression of the same fundamental law , that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb . An opposite conception would be decidedly in conflict with the gynxcocratic point of view . In antiquity already has the preference of night been associated with that of the left , and both have been placed in line with a dominant maternal influence . In this instance , too , hoary customs and usages , such as the reckoning of time by nights , the selection of the night for battles , council and court assemblies ,  | that is , the preference of darkness for the exercise of social functions , show that we are not dealing with a philosophic theory of a later origin , but with an actual , primary mode of life . Pursuing this line of reasoning , we shall easily recognize the preference of the moon over the sun and of the receptive earth over the fertilizing ocean as the integral characteristics of an epoch that was primarily matriarchic . Added to these observations comes the preference of the sinister aspect of life , death , over its bright aspect of creation , the predominance of the dead over the living and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will receive a deeper affirmation and significance . At this point we find ourselves involved in an ideology to which the matriarchy appears no longer as a strange and incomprehensible phenomenon , but as a homogeneous entity . Nevertheless , our picture still shows many gaps and vague patches . But every discovery that rests upon a solid foundation possesses the unusual power of rapidly attracting everything related to it into its own sphere , thus pointing readily the way from the obvious to hidden facts . A faint hint made by an author of antiquity often suffices , then , to disclose new vistas . Such an example is offered by the distinction of the sister and of the youngest-born child Both of these usages belong to the maternal principle , displaying its fundamental law in a new guise . The significance of the sister relationship is hinted at by a remark which Tacitus makes concerning the corresponding Ger , man practice . A similar report of Plutarch 's concerning Roman usages reveals the fact that here , too , we are not confronted by an accidental , localized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preference for the youngest child is fully recognized by Philostrates in his Heroic Tales . And even though this work falls into a somewhat later period , it is nonetheless of the greatest significance in the interpretation of the oldest ideas . A great number of disconnected examples , gleaned in part frorr mythical traditions and in part from historical reports , soot  | gather about these two practices , proving their universal application as well as their originality . It is not difficult to see with which phase of the gynacocratic idea each of these phenomena is associated . The preference of the sister over the brother merely lends a new expression to that of the daughter over the son . The preference of the youngest-born child attaches the prolongation of life to that offspring of the maternal stem , which , because it was the last to spring into being , will also be the last to be reached by death . The family that is based upon patriarchic law soon solidifies into one individual organism , while the matriarchic family bears that typically collective character which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this collective character which distinguishes the material aspects of life from the higher , spiritual ones . Herself the mortal image of the Mother of Earth , Demeter , every woman gives birth to children who are the brothers and sisters of every other woman 's child . The native country under matriarchy will know only brothers and sisters , and this will last until an exclusively patriarchal era will have superseded it , dissolving the unity of the mass and supplanting all with the smaller units of the family . In matriarchic communities this phase of the maternal principle frequently finds legal expression ; indeed it is often affirmed by law . Upon it rests that principle of liberty and equality which we shall often meet as a fundamental trait in the life of gynxcocracies . It is also the source of opposition to limiting barriers of any kind . It is the cause of the far-reaching significance of certain concepts , which , not unlike the Roman paricidium , were slow to exchange their natural and general meaning with their individual , i.e. , limited application . Finally it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of closeness and av , unci6eta , which knows no bounds and includes all members of the race without distinction . The absence of strife and aversion to warfare are characteristics that are repeatedly lauded in accounts of matriarchic states .  | The elevation of the human race and the progress of ethics are closely linked up with the rule of woman . In like manner the introduction of regularity and the cultivation of the religious sense . The enjoyment of every higher pleasure must be closely associated with the matriarchy . The longing for a purification of life arises earlier in woman than in man , and she also possesses to a higher degree the natural faculty of effecting it . The entire ethic code that follows upon barbarism is the work of woman . Her contribution to society is not only the power to give life , but also the ability to bestow all that which makes life beautiful . Hers is the earliest knowledge of the forces of nature , hers is also the presentiment and the hope that conquers the pain of death . Viewed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of civilization . It is the source and guarantee of its benefits , as well as a necessary educational period in the history of man . It is therefore in itself the realization of natural law whose patterns must be observed by entire races as well as by individual beings . The circle in which my ideas have developed has now been completed . I began by stressing the independence of matriarchy from all written laws and deduced from this its universal nature . I am now able to affirm its genuine posi. tion among family ethics and to complete its description . Originating with the life-giving power of maternity , whose physical image it reflects , the gynxcocracy is completely under the influence of matter and of the natural phenomena from which it has derived its laws . Woman is more keenly aware of the unity pervading all life . She is more closely linked to the harmony of the universe , of which she still is a part . She is more sensitive to the pain of man 's mortal fate and to that frailty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devotes her sorrow . She seeks with greater longing a higher consolation and finds it in the phenomena of nature . But these , too , she links up closely with the life-giving womb , the receptive , protecting , and nourishing mother 's love . Obedient in everv  | respect to the laws of material existence , she prefers to direct her glances down to the ground , placing the ZTovic powers above those of the Uranic light . She identifies male potency preferably with inland water , subordinating the procreative fluidum to the gremium matris , the OKedvos to the earth . Her own existence being grounded in the soil , she bestows all her care and labor upon the beautification of the material life , the npaptZi dpsT4 . In agriculture , which woman was the first to develop , and in the construction of walls , which the Ancients very closely associated with the cult of the chthonic , she achieves a perfection that has often been admired by later generations . In no other period than during the matriarchy has there been such an emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , while spiritual beauty was scarcely emphasized . Nor has there ever been another era that carried out so consistently the maternal dualism and a de facto realistic spirit . No other period has been equally concerned to further lyric enthusiasm , that primarily feminine mood , rooted in the love of nature . In other words , the gyna cocratic form of life is a well-ordered naturalism , its laws of thought are materialistic , its development is chiefly physical . It is a stage of culture that is just as necessary in matriarchy as it is strange and incomprehensible in a patriarchic age . Those who believe in the necessary primacy of permanent sexual unions can not be spared a humiliating surprise . The ruling thought of antiquity is not only different from theirs ; it is its perfect antithesis . The Demetrian principle of mar , iage appears at first as the limitation of a more original principle that was directly opposed to it . Marriage itself seems as the violation of a religious commandment . This condition , incomprehensible as it may appear to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone is able to explain to our satisfaction a series of  | most peculiar phenomena that have never been appreciated in their true light . It alone can account for the belief that marriage requires the propitiation of the godhead whose law it violates by its exclusive character . Nature has not endowed woman with all her charms merely to let her fade in the arms of one man . The law of materialism abhors all limitations ; it hates all bonds , and considers exclusiveness of any kind as a sin against its divine power . This fact , then , explains all usages that cause marriage itself to appear in association with rites of religious prostitution . Though varied in form , they are nevertheless similar in their fundamental idea . The deviation from natural law which is implied in marriage must be expiated by temporary prostitution , thus winning anew the favor of the god . The two institutions that appear to be mutually exclusive , prostitution and rigid marriage laws , now appear to be linked by the closest bonds : prostitution itself becomes a security for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition to which woman 's calling as wife is bound . It is obvious that the progress toward a higher morality could at best be very slow during the struggle against this attitude which , moreover , was shielded by religious sanction . The variety of intermediate stages which we discover prove , indeed , how fluctuating were the fortunes of the struggle that was waged on this behalf for thousands of years . The Demetrian principle advances but slowly toward victory . In the course of the ages the expiation which the married woman must pay was reduced to a smaller amount and to an easier service . The gradual emergence of these individual stages deserves our most careful understanding . At first the annual payment gives place to one single tribute . Instead of the matron it is the unmarried girl who serves as hetara ; prostitution , instead of being practiced after marriage , is now practiced before . Instead of unquestioning surrender to any male , only a certain few men are now selected . In connection with these limitations there appears the consecration of hierordulas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it places the payment of the expiation upon the shoulders of one particular class , thereby freeing the matron entirely from her duty and contributing toward the elevation of society . The lightest form of individual expiation is found in the sacrifice of the woman 's hair at marriage . Hair has in many instances been named as the equivalent of the body in the prime of life . The Ancients , especially , have associated it closely with the irregularity of hetaric procreation , particularly with the vegetation of the morast , its prototype in nature . All of these phases have left numerous traces in their wake , not only in mythology , but also in the history of different peoples ; they have found verbal expression even in the names of places , gods , and tribes . It seems strange to us , who are accustomed to different modes of thought , to see conditions and events which we are wont to relegate to the intimacy of the family circle exerting such a far-reaching influence upon the entire state , its rise and its decline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we are now concerned has not been given the slightest attention by past investigators . Still , it is precisely this connection which exists between the attitude toward the relationship of the sexes and the entire lives and destinies of nations that brings the following study into immediate contact with the primary questions of history . The encounter of the Asiatic world with that of the Greek is represented as a struggle between the Aphroditic-Hetcric and the Heroic-monogamous principles . Likewise , the cause of the Trojan War is led back to the violation of the marital couch . In continuation of the same idea , the finally complete conquest of Aphrodite , the mother of the ) Eneads , by the matronal Juno , is placed in the era of the second Punic War , that is , that period in which the inner strength of the Roman people had attained its apex . The connection that exists between all these phenomena can not be overlooked . History has imposed the task upon the Occident to lead the higher , Demetrian principle to vic-  | tory because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind from the bondage of the lowest telluricism in which the magic power of the Oriental culture has held it captive . It is to the political idea of the imperium with which it entered into the arena of world history that Rome owes the power which enabled it to end forever a complete culture that had once been prevalent in antiquity  | IN treating the subject of the growth of the idea of government , the organization into gentes on the basis of kin naturally suggests itself as the archaic framework of ancient society ; but there is a still older and more archaic organization , that into classes on the basis of sex , which first demands attention . It will not be taken up because of its novelty in human experience , but for the higher reason that it seems to contain the germinal principle of the gens . If this inference is warranted by the facts it will give to this organization into male and female classes , now found in full vitality among the Australian aborigines , an ancient prevalence as widespread in the tribes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be perceived that low down in savagery community of husbands and wives , within prescribed limits , was the central principle of the social system . The marital rights and privileges ( jura conjugalia ) , l established in the group , grew into a stupendous scheme , which became the organic principle on which society was constituted . From the nature of the case these rights and privileges rooted themselves so firmly that emancipation from them was slowly accomplished through movements which resulted in unconscious reformations . Accordingly it will be found that the family has advanced from a lower to a higher form as the range of this conjugal system was gradually reduced . The family , commencing in the consanguine , founded upon the intermarriage of brothers and sisters in a group , passed into the- footnote * Ancient Society . New York : Henry Holt &; Co.  | second form , the punaluan , under a social system akin to the Australian classes , which broke up the first species of marriage by substituting groups of brothers who shared their wives in common , and groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? marriage in both cases being in the group . The organization into classes upon sex , and the subsequent higher organization into gentes upon kin , must be regarded as the results of great social movements worked out unconsciously through natural selection . For these reasons the Australian system , about to be presented , deserves attentive consideration , although it carries us into a low grade of human life . It represents a striking phase of the ancient social history of our race . The organization into classes on the basis of kin now prevails among that portion of the Australian aborigines who speak the Kamilaroi language . They inhabit the Darling River district north of Sydney . Both organizations are also found in other Australian tribes , and so widespread as to render probable their ancient universal prevalence among them . It is evident from internal considerations that the male and female classes are older than the gentes : firstly , because the gentile organization is higher than that into classes ; and secondly , because the former , among the Kamilaroi , are in process of overthrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches is the unit of their social system , which place rightfully belongs to the gens when in full development . A remarkable combination of facts is thus presented ; namely , a sexual and a gentile organization , both in existence at the same time , the former holding the central position , and the latter inchoate but advancing to completeness through encroachments upon the former . This organization upon sex has not been found , as yet , in any tribes of savages out of Australia , but the slow development of these islanders in their secluded habitat , and the more archaic character of the organization upon sex than that into gentes , suggests the conjecture , that the former  | may have been universal in such branches of the human family as afterwards possessed the gentile organization . Although the class system , when traced out fully , involves some bewildering complications , it will reward the attention necessary for its mastery . As a curious social organization among savages it possesses but little interest ; but as the most primitive form of society hitherto discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progenitors of our own Aryan family were once similarly organized , it becomes important , and may prove instructive . The Australians rank below the Polynesians , and far below the American aborigines . They stand below the African Negro and near the bottom of the scale . Their social institutions , therefore , must approach the primitive type as nearly as those of any existing people . ' The Kamilaroi are divided into six gentes , standing with reference to the right of marriage , in two divisions , as follows : I. i . Iguana , ( Duli ) . 2 . Kangaroo , ( Murriira ) 3 3 . Oposcum , ( Mute ) . II . 4 . Emu , ( Dinoun ) . 5 . Bandicoot , ( Bilba ) . 6 . Blacksnake , ( Nurai ) . Originally the first three gentes were not allowed to intermarry with each other , because they were subdivisions of an original gens ; but they were permitted to marry into either of the other gentes , and vice versa . This ancient rule is now modified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carried to the full extent of permitting marriage into any gens but that of the individual . Neither males nor females can marry into their own gens , the prohibition being absolute . Descent is in the female line , which assigns the children to the gens of their mother . These are among the essential characteristics of the gens , wherever this institution is found in its archaic form . In its external features , therefore , it is perfect and complete among the Kamilaroi . But there is a further and older division of the people  | into eight classes , four of which are composed exclusively of males , and four exclusively of females . It is accompanied with a regulation in respect to marriage and descent which obstructs the gens , and demonstrates that the latter organization is in process of development into its true logical form , One only of the four classes of males can marry into one only of the four classes of females . In the sequel it will be found that all the males of one class are , theoretically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class into which they are al . lowed to marry . Moreover , if the male belongs to one of the first three gentes the female must belong to one of the opposite three . Marriage is thus restricted to a portion of the males of one gens , with a portion of the females of another gens , which is opposed to the true theory of the gentile institution , for all the members of each gens should be allowed to marry persons of the opposite sex in all the gentes except their own . The classes are the following : figure All the Ippais , of whatever gens , are brothers to each other . Theoretically , they are descended from a supposed common female ancestor . All the Kumbos are the same ; and so are all the Murris and Kubbis , respectively , and for the same reason . In like manner , all the Ippatas , of whatever gens , are sisters to each other , and for the same reason ; all the Butas are the same , and so are all the Matas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ippais and Ippatas are brothers and sisters to each other , whether children of the same mother or collateral consanguinei , and in whatever gens they are found . The Kumbos and Butas are brothers and sisters ; and so are the Murris and Matas , and the Kubbis and Kapotas respectively . If an Ippai and Ippata meet , who have never seen each other before , they address  | each other as brother and sister . The Kamilaroi , therefore , are organized into four great primary groups of brothers and sisters , each group being composed of a male and a female branch ; but intermingled over . the areas of their occupation . Founded upon sex , instead of kin , it is older than the gentes , and more archaic , it may be repeated , than any form of society hitherto known . The classes embody the germ of the gens , but fall short of its realization . In reality the Ippais and Ippatas form a single class in two branches , and since they can not intermarry they would form the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under two names , each of which is integral for certain purposes , and for the further reason that their children take different names from their own . The division into classes is upon sex instead of kin , and has its primary relation to a rule of marriage as remarkable as it is original . Since brothers and sisters are not allowed to intermarry , the classes stand to each other in a different order with respect to the right of marriage , or rather , of cohabitation , which better expresses the relation . Such was the original law , thus : Ippai can marry Kapota , and no other . Kumbo can marry Mata , and no other . Murri can marry Buta , and no other . Kubbi can marry Ippata , and no other . This exclusive scheme has been modified in one particular , as will hereafter be shown : namely , in giving to each class of males the right of intermarriage with one additional class of females . In this fact , evidence of the encroachment of the gens upon the class is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is thus seen that each male in the selection of a wife is limited to one-fourth part of all the Kamilaroi females . This , however , is not the remarkable part of the system . Theoretically every Kapota is the wife of every Ippai ; every Mata is the wife of every Kumbo ; every Buta is the wife of every Murri ; and every Ippata of every Kubbi . Upon this  | material point the information is specific . Mr. Fison , before mentioned , after observing that Mr. Lance had " had much intercourse with the natives , having lived among them many years on frontier cattle-stations on the Darling River , and in the trans-Darling country , " quotes from his letter as follows : " If a Kubbi meets a stranger Ippata , they address each other as Goleer ? Spouse . . . . A Kubbi thus meeting an Ippata , even though she were of another tribe , would treat her as his wife , and his right to do so would be recognized by her tribe . " Every Ippata within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Here we find , in a direct and definite form , punaluan marriage in a group of unusual extent ; but broken up into lesser groups , each a miniature representation of the whole , united for habitation and subsistence . Under the conjugal system thus brought to light , one-quarter of all the males are united in marriage with one-quarter of all the females of the Kamilaroi tribes . This picture of savage life need not revolt the mind because to them it was a form of the marriage relation , and therefore devoid of impropriety . It is but an extended form of polygyny and polyandry , which , within narrower limits , have prevailed universally among savage tribes . The evidence of the fact still exists , in unmistakable form , in their systems of consanguinity and affinity , which have outlived the customs and usages in which they originated . It will be noticed that this scheme of intermarriage is but a step from promiscuity , because it is tantamount to that with the addition of a method . Still , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from general promiscuity . Moreover , it reveals an existing state of marriage and of the family of which no adequate conception could have been formed apart from the facts . It affords the first direct evidence of a state of society which had previously been deduced , as extremely probable , from systems of consanguinity and affinity . ' Whilst the children remained in the gens of their mother ,  | they passed into another class , in the same gens , different from that of either parent . This will be made apparent by the following table : Male Female Male Female Ippai marries Kapota . Their children are Murri and Mata . Kumbo marries Mata . Their children are Kubbi and Kapota . Murri marries Buta . Their children are Ippai and Ippata . Kubbi marries Ippata . Their children are Kumbo and Buta . If these descents are followed out it will be found that , in the female line , Kapota is the mother of Mata , and Mata in turn is the mother of Kapota ; so Ippata is the mother of Buta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the same with the male classes ; but since descent is in the female line , the Kamilaroi tribes derive themselves from two supposed female ancestors , which laid the foundation for two original gentes . By tracing these descents still further it will be found that the blood of each class passes through all the classes . Although each individual bears one of the class names above given , it will be understood that each has in addition the single personal name , which is common among savage as well as barbarous tribes . The more closely this organization upon sex is scrutinized , the more remarkable it seems as the work of savages . When once established , and after that transmitted through a few generations , it would hold society with such power as to become difficult of displace ment . It would require a similar and higher system , and centuries of time , to accomplish this result ; particularly if the range of the conjugal system would thereby be abridged . The gentile organization supervened naturally upon the classes as a higher organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent in point of time , is shown by the relations of the two systems , by the inchoate condition of the gentes , by the impaired condition of the classes through encroachments by the gens , and by the fact that the class is still the unit of organization . These conclusions will be made apparent in the sequel . From the preceding statements the composition of the  | gentes will be understood when placed in their relations to the classes . The latter are in pairs of brothers and sisters derived from each other ; and the gentes themselves , through the classes , are in pairs , as follows : Gentes Male Female Male Female T. Iguana . All are Murri and Mata , or Kubbi and Kapota. 2 . Emu . All are Kumbo and Buta , or Ippai and Ippata. 3 . Kangaroo . All are Murri and Mata , or Kubbi and Kapota. 4 . Bandicoot . All are Kumbo and Buta , or Ippai and Ippata. 5 . Opossum . All are Murri and Mata , or Kubbi and Kapota. 6 . Blacksnake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The connection of children with a particular gens is proven by the law of marriage . Thus , Iguana-Mata must marry Kumbo ; her children are Kubbi and Kapota , and necessarily Iguana in gens , because descent is in the female line . Iguana-Kapota must marry Ippai ; her children are Murri and Mata , and also Iguana in gens , for the same reason . In like manner Emu-Buta must marry Murri ; her children are Ippai and Ippata , and of the Emu Bens . So Emu-Ippata must marry Kubbi ; her children are Kumbo and Buta , and also of the Emu gens . In this manner the gens is maintained by keeping in its membership the children of all its female members . The same is true in all respects of each of the remaining gentes . It will be noticed that each gens is made up , theoretically , of the descendants of two supposed female ancestors , and contains four of the eight classes . It seems probable that originally there were but two male , and two female , classes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of marriage ; and that the four afterward subdivided into eight . The classes as an anterior organization were evidently arranged within the gentes , and not formed by the subdivision of the latter . Moreover , since the Iguana , Kangaroo and Opossum gentes are found to be counterparts of each other , in the classes they contain , it follows that they are subdivisions of an original gens . Precisely the same is true of Emu , Bandicoot and Blacksnake , in both particulars ; thus reducing th , ' ?  | six to two original gentes , with the right in each to marry into the other , but not into itself . It is confirmed by the fact that the members of the first three gentes could not originally intermarry ; neither could the members of the last three . The reason which prevented intermarriage in the gens , when the three were one , would follow the subdivisions because they were of the same descent although under different gentile names . Exactly the same thing is found among the Seneca-Iroquois . Since marriage is restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one-half of all the females of one were , theoretically , the wives of one-half of all the males of the other . After their subdivision into six the benefit of marrying out of the gens , which was the chief advantage of the institution , was arrested , if not neutralized , by the presence of the classes together with the restrictions mentioned . It resulted in continuous in-and-in marriages beyond the immediate degree of brother and sister . If the gens could have eradicated the classes this evil would , in a great measure , have been removed . ' The organization into classes seems to have been directed to the single object of breaking up the intermarriage of brothers and sisters , which affords a probable explanation of the origin of the system . But since it did not look beyond this special abomination it retained a conjugal system nearly as objectionable , as well as cast it in a permanent form . It remains to notice an innovation upon the original constitution of the classes , and in favor of the gens , which reveals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ideal of the gens . It is shown in two particulars : firstly , in allowing each triad of gentes to intermarry with each other , to a limited extent ; and secondly , to marry into classes not before permitted . Thus , Iguana-Murri can now marry Mata in the Kangaroo gens , his collateral sister , whereas originally he was restricted to Buta in the opposite three . So Iguana-Kubbi can now marry Kapota , his collateral sister . Emu-Kumbo can now marry Buta , and Emu-Ippai  | can marry Ippata in the Blacksnake gens , contrary to original limitations . Each class of males in each triad of gentes seems now to be allowed one additional class of females in the two remaining gentes of the same triad , from which they were before excluded . The memoranda sent by Mr. Fison , however , do not show a change to the full extent here indicated e This innovation would plainly have been a retrograde movement but that it tended to break down the classes . The line of progress among the Kamilaroi , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a tendency to make the gens instead of the class the unit of the social organism . In this movement the overshadowing system of cohabitation was the resisting element . Social advancement was impossible without diminishing its extent , which was equally impossible so long as the classes with the privileges they conferred remained in full vitality . The jura conjugalia , which appertained to these classes , were the dead weight upon the Kamilaroi , without emancipation from which they would have remained for additional thousands of years in the same condition , substantially , in which they were found . An organization somewhat similar is indicated by the punalua of the Hawaiians . Wherever the middle or lower stratum of savagery is uncovered , marriages of entire groups under usages defining the groups have been discovered either in absolute form or such traces as to leave little doubt that such marriages were normal throughout this period of man 's history . It is immaterial whether the group , theoretically , was large or small , the necessities of their condition would set a practical limit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If then community of husbands and wives is found to have been a law of the savage state , and , therefore , the essential condition of society in savagery , the inference would be conclusive that our own savage ancestors shared in this common experience of the human race .  | In such usages and customs an explanation of the low condition of savages is found . If men in savagery had not been left behind , in isolated portions of the earth , to testify concerning the early condition of mankind in general , it would have been impossible to form any definite conception of what it must have been . An important inference at once arises , namely , that the institutions of mankind have sprung up in a progressive connected series , each of which represents the result of unconscious reformatory movements to extricate society from existing evils . The wear of ages is upon these institutions for the proper understanding of which they must be studied in this light . It can not be assumed that the Australian savages are now at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , show the contrary ; neither is there any ground for assuming their degradation from a higher condition , because the facts of human experience afford no sound basis for such an hypothesis . Cases of physical and mental deterioration in tribes and nations may be admitted , for reasons which are known , but they never interrupted the general progress of mankind . All the facts of human knowledge and experience tend to show that the human race , as a whole , have steadily progressed from a lower to a higher condition . The arts by which savages maintain their lives are remarkably persistent . They are never lost until superseded by others higher in degree . By the practice of these arts , and by the experience gained through social organizations , mankind have advanced under a necessary law of development , although their progress may have been substantially imperceptible for centuries . The Australian classes afford the first , and , so far as the writer is aware , the only case in which we are able to look r.awn into the incipient stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anterior organization so archaic ' -s that upon sex . It seems to afford a glimpse at society When it verged upon the primitive . Among other tribes the gens seems to have advanced in proportion to the curtail-  | ment of the conjugal system . Mankind rise in the scale and the family advances through its successive forms , as these rights sink down before the efforts of society to improve its internal organization . The Australians might not have effected the overthrow of the classes in thousands of years if they had remained undiscovered ; while more favored continental tribes had long before perfected the gens , then advanced it through its successive phases , and at last laid it aside after entering upon civilization . Facts illustrating the rise of successive social organizations , such as that upon sex , and that upon kin , are of the highest ethnological value . A knowledge of what they indicate is eminently desirable , if the early history of mankind is to he measurably recovered . Among the Polynesian tribes the gens was unknown ; but traces of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaiian custom of punalua . Original ideas , abso lutely independent of previous knowledge and experience are necessarily few in number . Were it possible to reduco the sum of human ideas to underived originals , the small numerical result would be startling . Development is the method of human progress . In the light of these facts some of the excrescences of modern civilization , such as Mormonism , are seen to be relics of the old savagism not yet eradicated from the human brain . We have the same brain , perpetuated by reproduction , which worked in the skulls of barbarians and savages in bygone ages ; and it has come down to us laden and saturated with the thoughts , aspirations and passions , with which it was busied through the intermediate periods . It is the same brain grown older and larger with the experience of the ages . These outcrops of barbarism are so many revelations of its ancient proclivities . They are explainable as a species of mental atavism . Out of a few germs of thought , . conceived in the early ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . Beginning their growth in the period of savagery  | fermenting through the period of barbarism , they have con , tinued their advancement through the period of civilization . The evolution of these germs of thought has been guided by a natural logic which formed an essential attribute of the brain itself . So unerringly has this principle performed its functions in all conditions of experience , and in all periods of time , that its results are uniform , coherent and traceable in their courses . These results alone will in time yield convincing proofs of the unity of origin of mankind . The mental history of the human race , which is revealed in institutions , inventions and discoveries , is presumptively the histoi'y of a single species , perpetuated through individuals , and developed through experience . Among the original germs of thought , which have exer , rised the most powerful influence upon the human mind , and upon human destiny , are these which relate to government , to the family , to language , to religion , and to property . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical progress , but can have no final consummation , because they are still progressing , and must ever continue to progress . NOTES 1 The Romans made a distinction between connubium. which related to marriage considered as a civil institution , and conjugium , which was a mere physical union . 2 For the detailed facts of the Australian system I am indebted to the Rev. Loritner Fison , an English missionary in Australia , who received a portion of them from the Rev. W. Ridley , and another portion from T. E. Lance , Esq. , both of whom had spent many years among the Australian aborigines , and enjoyed excellent opportunities for observation . The facts were sent by Mr. Fison with a critical analysis and discussion of the system , which , with observations of the writer , were published in the Proceedings of the Am .

A similar chart of the remaining marriageable classes will produce like results . These details arc tedious , but they make the fact apparent that in this condition of ancient society they not only intermarry constantly , but are compelled to do so through this organization upon sex . Cohabitation would not follow this invariable course because an entire male and female class were married in a group ; but its occurrence must have been constant under the system . One of the primary objects secured by the gens , when fully matured , was thus defeated : namely , the segregation of a moiety of the descendants of a supposed common ancestor under a prohibition of intermarriage , followed by a right of marrying into any other gens. 6 Proc . Am . Acad . Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation of peoples in the lower culture birth , s a phenomenon independent of the union of the sexes . By this it is not meant that at the present time everywhere among such peoples physiological knowledge is still in so backward a condition that the cooperation of the sexes is regarded as a matter of indifference in the production of children . That would be to contradict the facts . To-day the vast majority of savage and barbarous nations are aware that sexual union is ordinarily a condition precedent to birth . Even among such peoples , however , exceptions are admitted without difficulty ; and there are peoples like certain Australian tribes who do not yet understand it . Their stage of ignorance was probably once the state of other races and indeed of all humanity . The history of mankind so far as we can trace it , whether in written records or by the less direct but not less certain methods of scientific investigation , exhibits the slow and gradual encroachments of knowledge on the confines of almost boundless ignorance . That such ignorance should once have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible than that it should have extended to the cause of death . There are plenty of races who even yet attribute a death by anything else than violence to the machinations of an evil-disposed person or spirit , no matter how old or enfeebled by privation or hardship the deceased may have been . Nor do they omit anything which may render their ignorance on this point unambiguous ; they proceed to discover and punish the sorcerer ; they expel the malicious spirit ; they appease the enraged or arbitrary divinity . ? Primitive Paternity . London : David Nutt .  | Death has a character mysterious and awful , of which no familiarity has been able to divest it , and which not even the latest researches of physiologists have been able to dispel . Ignorance of the real cause of birth , it might be thought , on the other hand would not long survive the habitual commerce of men and women and the continual reproduction of the species . It would not , in our stage of civilization and with our social regulations . But the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentally and morally as well as physically . At the moment when the anthropoid became entitled to be properly denominated man his intellectual capacity was not that of a Shakespeare , a Newton , a Darwin , or even of an average Englishman of the twentieth century . He was only endowed with potentialities which , after an unknown series of generations and thanks to what we in our nescience variously dub a fortunate combination of circumstances or an overruling Providence , issued in that supreme result . The savage who has not been thus favored is still by comparison undeveloped . His intellectual faculties are chiefly employed in winning material subsistence , in gratifying his passions , in fighting with his fellow-man and with the wild beasts , often in maintaining a doubtful conflict against inclement skies , unfruitful earth or tempestuous seas . Many of them , therefore , are dormant , like a bud before it has unfolded . His attention , not habitually directed to the problems of the universe , is easily tired . His knowledge is severely limited ; his range of ideas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the solution of a merely speculative question by a tale that chimes with his previous ideas , though it may transcend his actual experience . Hence many a deduction , many an induction , to us plain and obvious , has been retarded , or never reached at all : he is still a savage . During many ages the social organization of mankind would not have necessitated the concentration of thought on the problem of paternity . Descent is still reckoned ex-  | clusively through the mother by a number of savage and barbarous peoples : This mode of reckoning descent is called by a useful term of German origin ? Motherright . It would be impossible to undertake an exhaustive enumeration of the peoples among which motherright prevails . The civilized nations of Europe and European origin reckon descent and consequently kinship through both parents . A few others , chiefly more civilized nations like the Chinese and the Arabs , agree with them . Apart from these it may be roughly said that motherright is found in every quarter of the globe . Not that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , many reckon through the father . But even where the latter is the case vestiges of the former are commonly to be traced . And the result of anthropological investigations during the past half-century has been to show that motherright everywhere preceded fatherright and the reckoning of descent in the modern civilized fashion through both parents . This past universality of motherright points to a very early origin . It must have taken its rise in a condition of society ruder than any of which we have cognizance . Let us consider what social organization it implies . Kinship is a sociological term . It is not synonymous with blood-relationship : it does not express a physiological fact . Many savage peoples are organized in totemic clans , each clan bearing usually the name of an animal or plant often supposed to be akin to the human members of the clan . Every member of the clan recognizes every other member as of the kin . Inasmuch as these clans extend frequently through whole tribes and even to distant parts of a vast continent like North America or Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a physiological sense blood-relations . Notwithstanding this , every member of the totemclan , wherever he may be found , is entitled to all the privileges and subject to all the disabilities incident to his status . He is entitled to protection at the hands of his fellowclansmen . He is liable to be called on to take part in the  | blood-feud of the clan , and to suffer by an act of vengeance for a wrong committed by some other member of the clan . Foremost among his disabilities is the prohibition to marry or have sexual relations with any woman within the kin , Consequently his children must all be children of women belonging to a different kin from his own . Though kinship , however , is not equivalent to bloodrelationship in our sense of the term , it is founded on the idea of common blood which all within the kin possess and to which all outside the kin are strangers . A feeling of solidarity runs through the entire kin , so that it may be said without hyperbole that the kin is regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit is more than metaphorically a member , a limb . The same blood runs through them all , and " the blood is the life . " Literally they may not all be descended from a common ancestry . Descent is the normal , the typical , cause of kinship and a common blood . It is the legal presupposition : by birth a child enters a kin for good and ill . But kinship may also be acquired ; and when once it is acquired by a stranger he ranks thenceforth for all purposes as one descended from the common ancestor . To acquire kinship a ceremony must be undergone : the blood of the candidate for admission into the kin must be mingled with that of the kin . This ceremony , no less than the words made use of in various languages to describe the members of the kin and their common bond , renders it clear that the bond is the bond of blood . The mingling of blood ? the Blood-covenant as it is called ? is a simple though repulsive rite . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and the flowing blood sucked from it by one of the clansmen , upon whom the operation is repeated in turn by the neophyte . Originally , perhaps , all the clansmen , assembled as witnesses if not as actual participants of the rite ; and even yet participation by more than one representative is frequently required . The exact form is not always the same . Sometimes the blood is dropped into a cup and diluted with some  | other drink . Sometimes food eaten together is impregnated with the blood . Sometimes a species of inoculation is practiced or it is enough to rub the bleeding wounds together , so that the blood of both parties is mixed and smeared upon them both . Among certain tribes of Borneo the drops are allowed to fall upon a leaf , which is then made up into a cigar with tobacco and lighted and smoked alternately by both parties . ' But whatever may be the exact form adopted the essence of the rite is the same , and its range is extraordinarily wide . It is mentioned by classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lydians and Iberians of Asia Minor and apparently the Medes . Many passages of the Bible , many of the Egyptian Book of the Dead , are inexplicable apart from it . Odin and Loki entered into the bond , which means that it was customary among the Norsemen ? as we know in fact from other sources . It is recorded by Giraldus of the Irish of his day ; and it still lingered as lately as two hundred years ago among the western islanders of Scotland . It is related of the Huns or Magyars and of the mediaval Roumanians . Joinville ascribes it to one of the tribes of the Caucasus ; and the Rabbi Petachia of Ratisbon , who traveled in Ukrainia in the twelfth century , found it there . In modern times every African traveler mentions it ; many of them have had to undergo the ceremony . In the neighboring island of Madagascar it is well known . All over the eastern Archipelago , in the Malay peninsula , among the Karens , the Siamese , the Dards on the northern border of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bengal and Central India , the wild tribes of China , the Syrians of Lebanon and the Bedouins , and among various autochthonous peoples of North and South America , the rite is or has been within recent times in use ? Nor has it ceased to be practiced in Europe by the Gypsies and the Southern Slays . In the French department of Aube , when a child bleeds he puts a little of his blood on the face or hands of one of his playfellows and says to him : " Thou shalt be my cousin . " In like manner in New England , when  | a school-girl not many years since pricked her finger so that the blood came , one of her companions would say : " Oh ! let me suck the blood ; then we shall be friends . " Something more than vestiges of the rite remains among the Italians of the Abruzzi . And the band of the Mala Vita , a society for criminal purposes in Southern Italy only broken up a few years ago , was a brotherhood formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncivilized have adopted an initiation-rite of which the blood-covenant forms part , either actually or by symbol representing an act once literally performed . That the blood-covenant , whereby blood-brotherhood is assumed , is not a primeval rite is obvious from its artificial character . At the same time its barbarism and the wide area over which it is spread point with certainty to its early evolution , and the fact that it is in union with conceptions essentially and universally human . It has its basis in ideas which must have been pre-existent . Even among races like the Polynesians , and the Turanian inhabitants of Northern Europe and Asia , where the rite itself may not be recorded , there are unmistakable traces of the influence of those ideas . On the other hand where , as among some of the peoples included above , it has ceased to be used for the purpose of admission to a clan , the rite or some transparent modification of it , has continued in use for the reconciliation of ancient foes or the solemnization of a specially binding league . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where descent is reckoned through females only , the father is not recognized as belonging to the kin of the children . Among matrilineal peoples exogamy , or marriage outside the kin , is usually if not always compulsory . So far is this carried that the artificial tie of the blood-covenant is a barrier to marriage . When Cuchulainn in the Irish saga of The Wooing of Emer wounded his love , Dervorgil , in the form of a sea-bird with a stone from his sling , he became her blood-brother by sucking from the wound the stone with  | a clot of blood round it . " I can not wed thee now , " he said , " for I have drunk thy blood . But I will give thee to my companion here , Lugaid of the Red Stripes . " And so it was done . ' This tale beyond doubt reflects the custom among the ancient Irish . The islanders of Webar in the East Indies , to select only one other example , represent even an earlier stage in the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually related to one another , and often at odds with the inhabitants of adjacent hamlets . But sometimes these quarrels are made up and a blood-covenant is entered into , after which no intermarriage can take place . ' The alien position of the father with regard to his children , and consequently the small account taken of him , has never been more vividly illustrated than by Miss Kingsley . She relates that on landing in French Congo she went to comply with the tiresome administrative regulations by reporting herself and obtaining a permit to reside in the colony . While she was waiting in the office of the Directeur del Administration a black man was shown in . " He is clad in a blue serge coat , from underneath which float over a pair of blue canvas trousers the tails of a flannel shirt , and on his feet are a pair of ammunition boots that fairly hobble him . His name , the interpreter says , is Joseph . Who is your father ? ' says the official . Clerk interprets into trade English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says the interpreter . My fader , ' says Joseph . Yes , ' says the interpreter , who 's your fader ? ' Who my fader ? ' says Joseph . Take him away and let him think about it , ' says the officer with a sad sardonic smile . Joseph is alarmed and volunteers name of mother ; this is no good ; this sort of information any fool can give ; Government is collecting information of a more recondite and interesting character . Joseph is removed by Senegal soldiers , boots and all . " ' Nobody on the west coast of Africa reckons descent through his father . Whether he knows who is his father or not is very often of no consequence to his social or legal position . The native law of the  | Bavili ( and the same is true of other tribes ) draws no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children . " Birth , " we are told by a keen observer who has lived for many years in intimate converse with the natives , " sanctifies the child " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mother 's family . The French cast-iron regulations , made for a different race and a different latitude , puzzled and confounded poor Joseph by the unexpected and absurd questions they required to be put to him . Miss Kingsley sarcastically observes : " As he 's going to Boma , in the Congo Free State , it can only be for ethnological purposes that the French government are taking this trouble to get up his genealogy . " Joseph does not understand the French government any more than the French government understands him ; and he has never traced his genealogy along those lines before . Joseph was a member of a Bantu tribe ; but the case is the same among the Negroes . The Fanti of the Gold Coast may be taken as typical . Among them , while an intensity of affection , accounted for partly by the fact that the mothers have the exclusive care of the children , is felt for the mother , " the father is hardly known or is disregarded , " notwithstanding he may be a wealthy and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America Charlevoix says that among the Algonkin nations the children belonged to and only recognized their mother . The father was always a stranger , " so nevertheless that if he is not regarded as father he is always respected as the master of the cabin . " 9 In Europe among the Transylvanian Gypsies " a man enters the clan of his wife , but does not really belong to it until she has borne a child . He never during his life shows the slightest concern for the welfare of his children , and the mother has to bear the whole burden of their maintenance . Even if the father is living , the son often never knows him , nor even has seen him . " " Among the Orang Mamaq of Sumatra the members of a suku , or clan , live together , and the feeling of kinship is  | very strong . As marriage within the clan is forbidden , husband and wife rarely dwell under one roof ; when they do , it is because the husband goes to the wife 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , which consists merely of the mother and her children . The latter belong solely to their mother 's clan ; the father has no rights over them ; and there is no kinship between him and them : In consequence of the spread of foreign influences the true family has begun to develop in a section of these people inhabiting the district of Tiga Loeroeng . The husband and wife usually live together , but the hi ' me is with the wife 's clan . Though the husband is considered a member of the family he exercises little power over the children . They belong to their mother 's suku , and the potestas , as usual in such cases , is in the hands of her eldest brother 11 A corollary of the principle that the father is not akin to his children is that children of the same father by different mothers are not reckoned as brothers and sisters . This is the rule of the Papuan tribe settled about Mowat on the Daudai coast of British New Guinea , 12 and indeed wherever motherright is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage of two or more sisters respectively to two or more brothers . Such children may accordingly intermarry . This permission however sometimes tends to be restricted , as among the Bayaka , of whom we are told that " marriage between children of the same mother is prohibited ; between children of the same father it occurs , but is considered unseemly. " 13 On the other hand it sometimes persists for a time , even a considerable time , among patrilineal peoples . By the laws of Athens children of the same father , but apparently not of the same mother , were allowed to intermarry . The same rule prevailed in Japan , " According to Hebrew legend Sarah was the daughter of Abraham 's father , but not of his mother . And when Amnon , King David 's son , sought to ravish his half-sister Tamar , in the course of her protest and struggles she said : " Now therefore I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he  | will not withhold me from thee . " 15 That is : while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere passing lust , marriage with him would have been legitimate and honorable . It is not necessary to contend that these stories are narratives of literal fact . There is no trustworthy evidence that they are . At the same time they are of high antiquity , and must have originated in a social condition where the incidents were not so far removed from daily life as to be incredible or even surprising . In that social condition kinship must have been counted only through the mother , or matrilineal having passed into patrilineal descent certain vestigial customs must have remained over from the prior stage . The incidents cited are therefore justly regarded as among the witnesses preserved to us that before the dawn of history the ancient Hebrews had traversed the stage of motherright . Enough has now been said to exhibit the alien position occupied among matrilineal peoples by the father in regard to his children . It remains to complete the picture by showing how the duties of head of the family are fulfilled , and in whom the authority ? or , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the African peoples the mother 's brother has greater rights over a child than the father , and the duty of blood-revenge falls to him , even against the father . Wherever progress has been made in the organization of the family , and motherright is still the basis of organization , as over perhaps the greater part of the African continent , the supreme power is vested in the Mother 's brother or maternal uncle . In Loango the uncle is addressed as Tate ( father ) . He exercises paternal authority over his nephew , whom he can even sell . The father has no power ; and if the husband and wife separate the children follow the mother as belonging to her brother . They inherit from their mother ; the father 's property on the other hand goes at his death to his brother ( by the same mother ) or to his sister 's sons 16 The customs of the peoples of the Lower Congo are  | the same . Around the missionary settlement of Wathen a woman is married by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's family , though the father receives a portion . But the wife is not bought as a slave , s bought . The husband acquires merely the right to her companionship , and in case of her death to another wife in her place . He has no control over his children by her . They belong to their mother 's family ; and as they grow up they go to live with their uncles . " Among the Igalwas the father 's authority over his children is very slight . " The really responsible male relative , " says Miss Kingsley , " is the mother 's eldest brother . From him must leave to marry be obtained for either girl or boy ; to him and the mother must the present be taken which is exacted on the marriage of a girl ; and should the mother die , on him and not on the father , lies the responsibility of rearing the children ; they go to his house , and he treats them as nearer and dearer to himself than his own children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , they become his heirs . " " Two kinds of marriage are known among the Bambala . The first is childmarriage . " A little boy of his own free will may declare that a certain little girl is his wife ; by this simple act he acquires a prescriptive right to her . He visits his future parents-in-law and takes them insignificant presents . When he is of mature age he gives a larger present , of the value of about 2000 djimbu ( a small shell of the species Olivella Nana ) , and then he is allowed to cohabit with her . Their children belong to the eldest maternal uncle . This form of marriage is attended by no special ceremony . If the girl , when of age , is unwilling , he can not coerce her ; but if she marries another man , the latter must make him a present of several thousand djimbu . " The other form of marriage is contracted between adults . The man pays a bride-price from Io , 000 to 15,000 djimbu to the father or maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the father ; but " parents have little  | authority over their children , who leave them at a very early age . " " A man 's property is inherited by the eldest son of his eldest sister , or in default by his eldest brother . " The mother 's brother is the guardian of his sister 's children . Here , as we have already seen reason to think , fatherright is beginning to make inroads on the original organization . This is confirmed by the further statement that " kinship is reckoned very far on the female side , " but " in the male line not beyond the uncle and grandfather , " " indicating that some kinship is now reckoned on the paternal side . The Bayaka , neighbors of the Bambala , and like them a Bantu people , dwell in small villages , often consisting of not more than two or three huts , presided over by a chief . " Each married woman has a separate hut where she lives with her children , and the husband moves from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hut . " " A child belongs to the village of his maternal uncle . " The inhabitants of a village regard themselves as akin . It is added that " relationship on the female side is considered closer than that on the male side . " 20 Among the Bangala of the Cassange Valley the chieftainship is elective . This is not unusual where female kinship prevails , for primogeniture has not yet developed , and among a band of equal brothers he who has proved himself the most capable is often preferred . Our information as to the Bangala is very defective . We are told : " The chief is chosen from three families in rotation . A chief 's brother inherits in preference to his son . The sons of a sister belong to her brother ; and he often sells his nephews to pay his debts . " zl It may be said generally that motherright prevails throughout Angola . " The closest relation is that of mother and child , the next that of nephew or niece and uncle or aunt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they are his heirs , not only in private property , but also in the chiefship , if he be a chief . " Z ' The father has , among the Kimbunda , no power  | over his children , even when they are young . Only his children by slaves are considered his property and can inherit from him.73 To avoid further repetition we may leave the foregoing to stand as examples of the organization of the western Bantu . They exhibit the mother 's brother or maternal uncle as the head of the family with almost absolute power over his sister 's children , in which authority of the father is however beginning to make breaches . Among the Negroes I have already referred to the Alladians . It may be added that the eldest of the etiocos , whether man or woman , is the head of the family . Although during the father 's lifetime the children reside with their mother in his house , on his death the sons go to live with their mother 's brother , unless he consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , but under their uncle 's tutelage . Polygamy prevails , but the . t children of the same father by different mothers scarcely consider that there is any tie between them . Marriages are arranged by the etiocos in council ; and apparently unless the bride be a mere child the bride-price is paid to them.24 The Ewhe-speaking peoples also trace kinship through females , except the upper classes of Dahomey , among which male kinship is the rule . " The eldest brother is the head of the family , and his heir the brother next in age to himself ; if he has no brother his heir is the eldest son of his eldest sister ... . Members of a family have a right to be fed and clothed by the family head ; and the latter has in his turn a right to pawn and in some cases to sell them . The family collectively is responsible for all crimes and injuries to person or property committed by any one of its members , and each member is assessable for a share of the compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the family receives a share of the compensation paid to it for any crime or injury committed against the person or property of any of its members . Compensation is always demanded from the family instead of from the in-  | dividual wrong-doer , and is paid to the family instead of to the individual wronged. " 26 Among the Ewhe of Anglo in Upper Guinea the maternal uncle has more authority over his sister 's sons than their father . Since they succeed to him at his death he requires from them labor and support in his lifetime . The nephew accompanies his uncle on trading journeys , carrying provisions , cowries , and merchandise . Under his uncle 's tuition he thus gradually learns to trade , besides other useful work such as weaving and so forth . By-and-by he begins to trade on behalf of his father or uncle , accounts to him for the proceeds and receives a share of the profit . And at length his father and uncle together negotiate a bride for him . The mother has naturally the charge and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to her marriage and cheerfully takes his share of the brandy and other gifts furnished by the bridegroom . " The Fanti Customary Laws have been expounded by Mr. Sarbab , a native barrister , in an elaborate treatise which throws much light on the pres ent condition of the Fanti family . Without discussing details , many of which are foreign to our present purpose , it may be stated generally that the Fanti are matrilineal . The head of the family is usually ( but not always ) the eldest male member in the line of descent . He has control over all the members ; he is their natural guardian ; he alone can sue or be sued , as the representative of the family , respecting claims on the family possessions . Within his compound the head of a family reigns supreme not only over his younger brothers and sisters and the children of the latter but also over his own wives and children . But he can not pawn his child without the concurrence of the mother 's relations ; and children who have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer under his power : they are wholly subject to their uncle. = ? The Negro has carried these customs in even a more archaic form to South America . The Bush Negro husband in Surinam does not live with his wife and often has wives in several  | different places . The maternal uncle supplies his place in the family . " Turning now to the true Negroes we find in Buna on the Ivory Coast a social condition in which fatherright is predominant , but has not yet succeeded in stamping out all vestiges of the more archaic stage . The family is strongly organized , its head being the eldest male , who is absolute master . All the children born during a marriage are the husband 's property , even those who are the fruit of adultery . In case of divorce where the wife is known to be pregnant the child subsequently born belongs to the husband ; if , however , her pregnancy be not then known she retains the child . ' In Seguela parentage runs in the paternal line by preference , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage belongs to the husband . In case of lengthened absence of the husband the wife is authorized to live in concubinage with another man , preferably a member of the family . At his return the husband takes her back , together with any children born during his absence.30 The Krumen of Sassandra reckon descent on both sides , but we are told that the female side is of little importance . The descendants of a common ancestor in the male line dwell together in the same village and form a clan . Since polygamy is here as elsewhere among the Negroes practically unlimited , infidelity to one wife leads to no more serious consequence than little tiffs . Adultery by the wife herself is hardly graver , the French official report tells us ; and everything is comfortably arranged , if she only share with her husband the presents she has received from her lover . Some husbands , indeed , especially old chiefs who are inclined to violence , revenge themselves ; but it is rare to find a really jealous husband . Sometimes , but very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thoroughly abandoned . Conformably with these easy-going morals the law declares no distinction between legitimate , illegitimate , and adulterine children . Is pater quem nuptice demonstrant admits of no exception . The husband is considered the  | father , even though he has been absent for ten years , of any children his wife may have borne in the meantime . " The Krumen of Cavally reckon descent only on the male side . There is no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children . The children are the wealth of the family and they are always welcome , even when the husband knows he is not the real father . They belong to him in all cases . He may however inflict corporal punishment on his adulterous wife , or even send her back to her family and obtain repayment of the bride-price . He may also institute a palaver against the adulterer for damages , which may be settled if he so please by an exchange of wives . The patria potestas vests in the eldest male of the highest generation living , and devolves with the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no brothers the eldest son inherits.32 In the foregoing cases the marriage rites are of the most restricted character . On the other hand , among the Andon ' , of Southern Nigeria ( if I am right in thinking them patrilineal ) an elaborate ceremony is performed . Two stout sticks of a certain wood called odiri , about four feet long , are supplied by the Juju priests from the sacred grove . They are sharpened at the end and first laid on the ground in a corner of the bridegroom 's house by the priests . The bride and bridegroom are then made to place their feet on them . The priest kills a goat and sprinkles its blood on their feet and on the sticks . The stakes are then driven by their sharpened ends into the ground in the corner of the house , and there they remain until they fall to pieces . From that moment the wife and all the children she may bear , by whomsoever begotten , are the husband 's property . The marriage is indissoluble , Even if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be delivered up to him on his demand . When she dies she can not be buried save by him ; any other person undertaking this important function would incur heavy punishment ; before the days of British rule it was death 33 Islam is not necessarily a religion of high civilization . It  | has made extensive conquests in Africa by reason of its power of adaptation to lower stages of culture . By Mohammedan law kinship is reckoned through both lines ; but such preponderant importance is attached to the paternal side that semicivilized African populations professing Islam may for our purpose be regarded as patrilineal . Just as among patrilineal peoples where fatherright is carried out to its logical term , great importance is attributed to the purity of Mohammedan women . On the other hand the law , by the aid of the physiological ignorance of the early doctors who framed it , stretches beyond all probability the presumption of legitimacy in its doctrine of the possibility of very lengthened gestations . A famous Maghribin saint named Sidi Nail lent his home and went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . At length he returned to find that his wife Cheliha had only a short time before given birth to a son . Even the credulity of the faithful , supported by the law , has had the greatest difficulty in digesting the legitimacy of this child . Yet the saint himself seems to have accepted him , and his sonship has been duly attested by heaven ; for it is especially among his descendants that the gift of miracles possessed by Sidi Nail has been perpetuated.34 In the same way the Bayazi , an heretical sect of which the bulk of the Arab population of Zanzibar consists , allow legitimacy to children born within two years after the husband 's death . The Shafei , another sect , extend the period to four years 3 " Mohammedan law , exaggerated by these heretical sects , seems indeed a device for gathering into the husband 's kin all the children of his wives to whom any semblance of a claim can be made . Among the Galla of northeastern Africa , who are Moslem , the illegitimate children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are legally descendants of the husband33 Customs similar to those prescribed in the ancient Indian law-books have even been in use in Europe . A Spartan law attributed to Lycurgus required an old man who had a young wife to introduce to her a young man whose bodily  | and mental qualities he approved , that he might beget children on her.37 The primary object indeed of this law of others fathered on the same law-giver was said to be what is called in modern scientific jargon Eugenics . However that may have been as regards the form in which they are reported to us , there can be little doubt that they are formulations of preexisting custom which enabled the continuance of the husband 's family by another man . At all events at Athens a law ascribed to Solon was in force which provided that if the next-of-kin who had in accordance with law successfully claimed an heiress for himself were impotent , his place should be supplied by some of his relatives ( cum mariti adgnatis concubito ) . This as McLennan points out is identical with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object was to provide heirs ; and the children took the estate as soon as they were able to perform the duties to their legal ancestors.38 The old peasant custumals of Germany , especially of Westphalia , lay it down that an impotent husband shall perform the ceremony of taking his wife on his back over nine fences and then calling a neighbor to act as his substitute . If he can not find one who is able and willing , he is to adorn her with new clothes , hang a purse at her side with money to spend and send her to a kermess , in the hope of finding some one there to help her 39 Grimm , commenting on these curious prescriptions . admits that there is no historical record of any such actual transaction , but observes that they are plainly and seriously prescribed and that their memory lingers in tradition , instancing an old poem of Saint Elizabeth . He suggests that in the custumals all the details are not mentioned , that probably the rite was only performed where serious detriment would result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choice of a substitute was not unlimited . In any case he holds the custom to be very archaic , though in the records it appears adapted to the circumstances of medieval peasant-proprietors . The foregoing examples are all chosen from peoples  | among whom fatherright is the rule , or who deduce kinship through both parents with preference for the father , as in the highest civilization . Where these customs are in vogue the husband can not be sure of the paternity of the children born of his wife . On the contrary he is often sure that the children belonging to him , reckoned of his kin and inheriting his property , are not in fact heirs of his body . They may even be born long after his death as the result of intercourse between his wives and other men . The list might be indefinitely lengthened if the customs of peoples among whom fatherright though predominant is imperfectly developed were considered . Thus in Madagascar motherright has left much more than traces . The hindrances on marriage of relatives are greater on the mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters by the same mother can not intermarry , nor can their descendants . On the other hand children and grandchildren of a brother and sister by the same mother may intermarry on the performance of a slight ceremony prescribed to remove the disqualification of consanguinity . The royal family and nobles trace their lineage , contrary to the general practice , through the mother and not through the father . Yet so great a calamity is it counted that a man should die without posterity that if an elder brother die childless his next brother must take the widow and raise up seed to the deceased.4 ? This involves sexual relations only after the husband 's death between the widow and his brother . But the Malagasy customs are furtherreaching still ; for all the children of a married woman belong to her husband , whoever may beget them . Divorce is a frequent occurrence and for trivial causes . When it takes place , not only are the children previously born retained by the husband , but any whom the wife may afterwards bear to another man belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure them by taking a present to each one as it is born ; a ceremony which appears to constitute a formal claim to them . In the ceremony of divorce The husband 's final word to his wife is an injunction to  | remember that though she is now at liberty to marry any one else , all her future children will belong to him , tht husband divorcing her.41 Motherright then is found not merely where paternity if uncertain , but also where it is practically certain . Father right on the other hand is found not merely where paternity is certain , but also where it is uncertain and even where the legal father is known not to have begotten the children . Nay , the institutions of fatherright often require provision for , and very generally permit , the procreation by other men of children for the nominal father . It follows therefore that the uncertainty of paternity can not be historically the reason for the reckoning of descent exclusively through the mother . Some other reason must be discovered .

In the Marquesas a man had marital rights over all his wife 's sisters , whether these married other men or not . The same causes which tend to limit every kind of polygamy restrict sororal polygyny in practice ; it is sometimes a severe strain on a man 's resources to marry a whole family . That difficulty is , however , often relieved by the fact that , since in primitive society girls usually marry at puberty , the younger sisters are not marriageable at the time of their elder sisters ' marriage ; and by that time the man 's circumstances may have improved so as to enable him to maintain a larger family . From those usages follows the rule which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unlawful for a younger sister to be married before her elder sister . That rule , on which Laban insisted when he gave his daughters to Jacob , namely that " it must not be done so in our country to give the younger sister before the first-born , " is a matter of fundamental morality , not only in most of the lower phases of culture , but in societies so highly civilized as that of China , and it has left traces at the present day even in England and in Scotland . If the husband does not wish , or can not afford , to exercise his claim on his wife 's sisters , he allows them to marry other men , but in order to do so his consent is necessary ; when a bride-price is due it is sometimes to him and not to the girl 's relatives that it is paid . An additional sister is given as t matter of course if the first sister proves barren ; the younger sister either replacing her , or joining her in her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exchanged for another sister for no other reason than incompatibility of temper , or simply because the man wishes it . Of the Indians of the Oregon , for example , it is remarked that " the parents do not seem to object to a man 's turning off one sister and taking a younger one , "  | that prerogative being " a custom handed down from time immemorial . " In Australia , however , among the Gournditch-mara , if a man has repudiated his wife he loses his claim to her sisters , being regarded as having divorced the whole family . Among the Tartars , if the wife dies before the payment of the bride-price is completed , the sum already paid goes toward the acquisition of her sister ; but if there is no sister to take the wife 's place the whole of the deposit is lost . In other instances the husband or bridegroom may demand a refund of the bride-price , should the family refuse to supply the widower with another wife . A deceased wife 's sister is supplied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the Kalmuks the right to marry a deceased wife 's sister is regarded as a claim which a man is entitled to enforce . Should the father be unwilling to yield the younger sister to the widower , the latter calls on . him , places bread and salt on the table , whereupon the father is held bound to give up the younger sister . Among the Kirghis failure to hand over the deceased wife 's sistel is an offense punishable by law . So strong is the claim that among the Flat-heads and other Oregon tribes , if the de ? ? ceased wife 's sister is already married to another man , she is obliged to leave him and marry the widower . Among the Wabemba of the Congo , if a man 's wife dies , and all her sisters are married , the husband of one of them must allow his wife to cohabit for one or two nights with the widower . Unless this is done the latter can not marry another woman . The same rule is observed by the Baholoholo ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister be a mere infant , the widower goes through the form of imitating the sexual act and pretending to have connection with the infant , although he does not marry her . In the last instances the usage of sororal succession has become a mere ritual . We shall see that similar ritual survivals abound in relation to the corresponding custom of fraternal succession. , nr the levirate . The observance of the ritual derives its obligatory or beneficial character from its formal conformity with  | established custom ; for to comply with an established custom is always lucky , and to omit its observance unlucky . With the Wabemba , when the sister happens to be an infant she is nevertheless handed over to the widower , but a slave-girl is sent with her to act as a substitute until the girl grows to nubile age . Similarly among the Assiniboins if , when a man 's wife dies , her sister is still immature , she is kept for him until she attains puberty . The same rule as to age must , however , be observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the wife 's lifetime . Thus among the Kaikari of central India , a man may marry his deceased wife 's younger sister , but may not marry her elder sister . Marriage with a deceased wife 's sister is sometimes regarded in the light of a moral obligation rather than as a claim or privilege . Thus the Iroquois widower who failed to do so . was subjected to such abuse on the part of the insulted lady that he seldom failed to comply . Among the Shuswap of British Columbia the widower was actually kept a prisoner by the deceased wife 's family until the period of mourning was over , and was released from his imprisonment on condition only that he married the deceased lady 's sister . On the island of Engano the widower who failed to marry his deceased wife 's sister was punished with a heavy fine . The abnormal notion that it is reprehensible to marry one 's deceased wife 's sister is a rare anthropological curiosity which appears to be found only among the natives of New Britain , some Chinese tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man 's wife dies he marries her sister , which is often the only survival of sororal polygyny , is thus clearly an attenuated relic of the widespread claim of a man to all the sisters of a family when he marries one of them , and it would be difficult to find any two social facts the connection between which is so manifest and so fully exhibited by every possible transition and similarity in the mode of their observance . Nevertheless , in accordance with an even more general rule , those people who observe the  | rule of marrying their deceased wife 's sister , but who have given up simultaneous sororal polygyny , do not admit that they at present practice the former custom because they once practiced the latter , and that their present usage is derived from one which they now condemn , but justify their practice by independent considerations of sentiment or expediency . Thus the natives of the Hervey Islands , who until quite lately practiced as a matter of course sororal polygyny , are all at the present day good Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman feels herself to be deeply injured if her brother-in.law does not , on the death of his wife , ask her to become a mother to his children . " Similarly , some Omaha Indians , among whom sororal polygyny was a time-honored practice , but who now conform to Christian usages , are reported to submit that marriage of a deceased wife 's sister is expedient because " the children bereft of their own mother ... would come under the care of her close kindred , and not fall into the hands of a stranger , " or that the usage " shows a respect for the dead . " In like manner writers on anthropological subjects to whom the application of the theory of evolution to the human race is repugnant , have no hesitation in declaring that they can not " find any reason for the assumption that the custom of marrying a deceased wife 's sister is derived from the custom of marrying her other sister in her lifetime . " The peoples who practice sororal polygyny and the missionaries and other writers who interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin and observance of the usage . The favorite explanation given by travelers and missionaries who report the custom as a peculiarity of the peoples they are describing is that it is desirable in a polygynous family that the wives should be sisters , because sisters are more likely to live together in harmony . The wives of an American Indian are said to live together " in the greatest harmony . " If , however , a man marries into two different families , " the wives , " it is alleged , " do not  | harmonize well together , and give the husband much inquietude . " But there is an overwhelming mass of testimony to the perfect harmony obtaining between wives in polygynous families , whether the wives be sisters or not . Where polygyny obtains , the women are the most persistent advocates of the practice , and additional wives are in most instances acquired at the desire of a man 's wife or wives , and are very commonly selected by them . There is nothing to indicate that the wives in a polygynous family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who live together , or that wives who are sisters are less liable to disagree than those who are not . In contradiction to the assumption of several writers , La Potherie asserts that sisters among the North American Indians are often particularly quarrelsome , and that their disputes are sometimes so lively that they attack one another with knives . The value of the psychological suppositions as to the greater harmony between wives who are sisters offered by uncultured peoples when pressed to account for their customs , is pointedly illustrated by the opinion of the Ostyak on the subject . Although it is their immemorial custom to marry several sisters , and they say that the observance of the usage brings luck , they nevertheless state that the arrangement is unsatisfactory and that they would prefer to marry women who are unrelated , " because experience shows that sisters are particularly liable to disagree in such marriage . " The practice of sororal polygyny , like every other traditional custom , presents , there can be no doubt , many advantages that could be adduced in its defense or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and customs do not generally owe their origin to the careful a priori weighing of fine points of psychology . It may be doubted whether Melanesian savages are much concerned about the amicable nature of the relation between their wives , about respect for their deceased wives , or proper qualifications in the nurses of their children . None of those alleged beneficial effects of the practice is applicable to ethnological facts as  | we find them ; they do not account for a man navmg to marry his wife 's sisters against his will or for his collecting the bride-price when they marry other men , or for his having to wait , with a slave-girl as a substitute , when thosr sisters are still infants in arms , or for his having a recog nized right of access to them whether he marries them or not . With peoples in the lowest stage of social organization the practice of sororal polygyny and of sororal succession is , like that of cross-cousin marriage , the automatic effect of the principles which constitute the foundation of their social organization , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of cross-cousin marriage , that of sororal polygyny in its narrower sense is a translation in terms of family relationship of the wider conceptions of clan relationship . In the one case the crosscousins and the sisters are what we , in accordance with the family system , call " actual , " or " own " cousins , and " own " sisters ; in the other they are cousins and sisters in the tribal sense , and according to the system of relationship obtaining in more primitive societies . If relationship be reckoned from the point of view of the clan-group , the term " wife " includes all the women of the corresponding marriage-group , and all those women are " sisters " ; that a man 's wives should be sisters is not a right or claim , or a matter of policy , but a consequence of primitive organization to which there exists no alternative . According to the clear and oft-quoted description of Dr. Codrington , " speaking generally , it may be said that to a Melanesian man all women , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives ; to the Melanesian woman all men are either brothers or husbands ... At must not be understood that a Melanesian regards all women who are not of his own division as in fact his wives , or conceives himself to have rights which he may exercise in regard to those women of them who are unmarried ; but the women may be his wives by marriage , and those who can not be so stand in a widely different relation to him ; and it may be added that all women who may become wives  | by marriage and are not yet appropriated , are to a certain extent looked upon by those who may be their husbands as open to more or less legitimate intercourse . In fact , appropriation of particular women to their husbands , though established by every sanction of native custom , has by no means so strong a hold in native society , nor in all probability so deep a foundation in the history of the people , as the severance of either sex by divisions which most strictly limit the intercourse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they do not themselves belong . " Translated into terms of the relationship set up by the smaller family-group , those principles imply that a man has a right to all the women of the group into which he marries . The true reason for the principle of sororal polygyny in its various forms is very clearly stated by the Omaha woman who , according to the Rev. J. Owen Dorsey , says to her husband : " I wish you to marry my brother 's daughter , as she and I are one flesh . " Instead of " brother 's daughter , " she may say her sister or her aunt . The converse or complementary aspect of the rule that when a man contracts a marriage with a family he marries all the marriageable females of that family is the principle that when a woman contracts a marriage with another family she marries all the marriageable males of that family . The simultaneous observance of the two rules constitutes a marriage between the several individuals composing them . The one-sided observance of sororal polygyny and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day much more common than the combination of the two practiced as complete group-marriage . The reason of this is , on consideration , plain . The combination of the two practices is , as we have already noted , an unstable arrangement ; for unless the groups to which the men and the women respectively belong be supposed to be broken up and a new grouping of men and women substituted for the original groups , the arrangement can only operate in an unmodified form where sexual relations do not entail permanent cohabi-  | tation . As soon as marriage involves not only sexual relations , but also economic interdependence and association , such an arrangement becomes almost impracticable in an unmodified form ; for no economic association can take place between a man and a woman or group of women unless the labor of those women is in some degree specially allotted to the man , unless , therefore , he has an individual right to their labor . Unmodified group-marriage is , thus , a practicable arrangement so long only as sexual relations remain completely independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such economic factors enter into that relation the organization must of necessity break up into one or the other of its constituent aspects , into sororal polygyny or fraternal polyandry . But the whole development of individualism , of individual property , and of personal economic interests has taken place mainly in the hands of the men and not of the women , and in human societies as they exist at the present day the economic advantages are generally in favor of the men . Since it is those very factors which constitute the chief difficulty in the practical operation of unmodified group-marriage , it is naturally to be expected that when that organization breaks up , it will do so in the form of sororal polygyny rather than in that of fraternal polyandry . And in fact fraternal polyandry , although scarcely less widespread in its distribution than sororal polygyny , is found to be considerably less common . Not only is it less common , but pure fraternal polyandry is , in point of fact , even more rare than it is generally supposed and currently stated to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraternal polyandry be more closely inquired into , it will be found in a large proportion of instances that , in addition to the rule of fraternal polyandry , that of sororal polygyny is either actually observed also or that there are strong indications that it was until lately observed . In other words , although primitive group-marriage customs frequently assume the modified form of sororal  | polygny without polyandry , when fraternal polyandry sur vives , the converse aspect of the collective relation survives also ; and most instances of fraternal polygamous marriage are in reality examples of complete group-marriage and not of its decay in the form of fraternal polyandry . Accordingly , instead of reviewing separately reported instances of fraternal polyandry and of group-marriage , we shall consider together those survivals of primitive marriage institutions . Collective Marriage Among the Peoples of Northern Asia We will begin our survey in that region which includes the northeastern portion of Asia and the adjoining northern portion of the American continent , and which constitutes a cultural and ethnical link between the old world and its civilizations and the new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Gilyak are a pala ? o-Asiatic race inhabiting the region of the lower Amur River , immediately north of Manchuria , and the northern parts of the adjacent island of Sakhalin . Our information concerning their customs illust : ates the confusion to which I have just referred . An old Japanese traveler mentions incidentally that Gilyak women have several husbands . The more recent account of an able French traveler gives us more specific details . Brothers have their wives to some extent in common ; when an elder brother is absent on a journey his younger brother enjoys marital rights over his wife , although the converse does not hold . " Villages are inhabited as a rule by members of the same family ; every Gilyak comes into the world with so many fathers and so many mothers that it is somewhat difficult to understand their system of relationship . " Another traveler reports that their sexual relations are indiscriminate , and that the circumstance is accounted for by the tradition that " in earlier times cousins ( rus-er ' ) had the juridic right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins . " Such information has , however , been greatly amplified by the extensive investigations , including a census , conducted  | among the Gilyak by Dr. Leo Y. Sternberg , the distinguished director of the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology of the former Imperial Russian Academy of Science . The Gilyak are strictly organized into exogamic intermarrying classes , and every member , male and female , of one class marries into the corresponding marriage class to which he or she is allotted from birth . Those classes correspond exactly to the degree of relationship , and the terms used to denote these indicate at the same time the norms of their marriage regulations . Thus the woman whom a man is bound to marry is his cross-cousin ; on the other hand all other cousins , the daughters of a father 's brother or a mother 's sister , are strictly barred even in the remotest degree , and are called " yoch , " which implies that they are absolutely tabu and inviolable . The name given by a man to the women whom he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a woman to the men whom she may marry is " pu . " Individual marriage takes place , that is , a woman becomes the particular economic associate of a man . But the economic husband pos. sesses no exclusive sexual rights over the woman : " all peo. ple who are in the relation of angej ' and pu ' have really the right of sexual intercourse , not only before , but also after , individual marriage . " When her husband is absent a wife is free to receive any man who is " pu " to her ; his brothers ( actual and tribal ) living in the same village or neighborhood do customarily use that right , and every man who is " pu " to a woman has the right to claim his privilege Sometimes a man from a distant part , hearing that an " angej " of his is living in a certain village will come to claim the right . In one respect the rules of group-marriage are different in the two principal divisions of the Gilyak nation ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have marital rights over the wives of each other indifferently . Among the eastern Gilyak , on the other hand , the younger brothers have a claim to the wives of all their elder brothers , but the elder brothers have no right . to the wives of the younger brothers . The terms of relation-  | ship are modified in accordance with those distinctions in the two divisions , the wives of younger brothers being " yoch , " that is , forbidden , to the elder brothers . Dr. Sternberg sees in that rule of the eastern Gilyak , the significance of which will be perceived later on , a step from unmodified group-marriage towards the establishment of patriarchal rights . The Yakut , the great Turki nation of which the Manchus are a branch , are divided into totemic clans . When the Russians first came upon them polygyny was general ; the nature of that polygyny is clearly indicated by the fact that at the present day the sisters of the bride , as well as the bride herself , must carefully abstain from ever showing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his brothers or cousins . They have been for the last hundred years members of the Orthodox Russian- Church , but their former organization still survives in a curiously modified form , for it is the established custom " that two brothers of one side marry two sisters of another . " The same terms are employed to denote a man 's own children or his brother 's . Betrothals take place in infancy . Among the Kamchadals it appears that the favorite marriage is between cousins , that is , presumably cross-cousins . Sororal polygyny was the recognized usage ; when a man took a second wife she was his first wife 's sister , or failing a sister her first-cousin , or tribal sister . A man frequently had two or three wives , either living in the same household or in separate dwellings . We are further told that it was customary between " friends , " which expression usually means tribal brothers , to exchange wives , and the levirate rule was observed . In spite , therefore , of the imperfect and fragmentary character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marital relations conformed to the principles of sororal and fraternal group-marriage . The Tungus are , numerically , by far the most important lace in northern Asia , extending from the borders of China in the east over the whole northern portion of the continent  | to the Ob River in the northwest . The organization of the Ochi tribe has been carefully investigated by Dr. Sternberg . Among them marriage is regulated by a classificatory sys , tern of relationship with wide age-grades , so that not only do those who stand in the relation of cross-cousins belong to reciprocal marrying classes , but also those who stand in the relation of uncle and niece , the daughter of a man 's sister belonging to the class into which he is by birth married . Among the Tungus complete group-marriage relations obtain , for not only is sororal polygyny observed , but every man has marital rights over the wives of his elder brothers . Further , owing to the inclusiveness of their classificatory system , he has also marital rights over the wives of the younger brothers of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme northeast of the Asiatic continent , the Chukchi , mentions that , " among other customs , they have the usage of contracting so-called exchange-marriages : Two or more men enter into an agreement whereby they have mutual rights to each other 's wives . The right is exercised whenever the contracting parties come together , as for instance on the occasion of a visit . Even unmarried men or widowers can enter into an exchange-marriage , ' which thus assumes the form of a veritable polyandry . " We have , concerning the Chukchi , the elaborate monograph of Mr. Wlademar Bogoras , sumptuously published in the series of publications of the " Jesup North Pacific Expedition . " The Chukchi are commonly betrothed in infancy to their first-cousins , that being the prescriptive marriage alliance . They moreover observe sororal polygyny ; if a man desires or can afford to maintain several wives he has a right during her life-time as well as after her death to the sisters of his first wife . Further , not only have the Chukchi the common custom of exchanging wives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men will solemnly bind themselves to mutual rights over their respective wives . Practically every Chukcha , we are told , belongs to such  | a marrying group . At first sight it would appear as if this group-marriage organization were an artificial one , that is to say , one formed by a pact into which the members deliberately enter by an individual contract , and not groupmarriage in what we are led to regard as its typical and original form as a mutual relation arising from wan established collective contract between the two groups . But the matter wears a different complexion when we are informed that " second and third cousins are almost invariably united by ties of group-marriage , " and that it is indeed exceptional for any but cousins to belong to a group exercising those reciprocal marital rights . It is well to note , as a corrective to the ideas by which it is customary to judge those marriage organizations , that in this instance we have clear testimony that licentiousness has nothing to do with the institution . The Chukchi are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization is not taken advantage of for licentious purposes . In fact , they are careful not to form such an alliance if possible with dwellers in the same village , and they in general avoid exercising the rights conferred on them by the compact . It is , as in all instances where deliberate exchange of wives takes place with a friend or a guest , as a bond of brotherhood that the relation is regarded . A man will thus seek to bind himself to those of his relatives who dwell in other villages , and when he visits those villages his tribal cousin will yield to him his bed , presently returning the visit in order to make the obligation mutual ; sometimes cousins will exchange wives for several months , for years , or permanently . So seriously is the arrangement regarded that children of the same marriage group are regarded as brothers and sisters ; they are not allowed to marry among themselves , such a union being looked upon as incestuous . It appears , then , that although the group-marriage of the Chukchi is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , it nevertheless corresponds to , and is a direct derivative of , established marriage rights between two  | marrying classes or groups , modified by the necessities imposed by the isolated and scattered condition of those groups , who live in small communities ranging over wide areas . That conclusion is confirmed the more we inquire into such reported instances of polyandrous arrangements . Passing to the bridge of islands which connects the Asiatic with the American continent across the Bering Sea , the majority of the reports which we have concerning the Aleuts are of the same character as those which are current concerning the Chukchi or the Gilyak , and represent them as given to loose polyandrous unions by " agreement " or from expediency . Thus Count Langsdorf says that a woman sometimes " lives with two husbands , who agree among themselves upon the conditions on which they are to share . her . " Father Veniaminoff , after stating that polygyny was , usual among the Aleuts , adds that " in addition the custom of polyandry is practiced , a woman having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one who has the title of helper , ' or partner ' ( in Russian , polovinschtchik ' ) . Those supplementary husbands enjoyed all marital rights , and were under obligation of contributing towards the upkeep of the household . The women living in such double marriages were in no wise regarded as immoral , but on tilt , contrary were rather honored for their industry in caring for two men besides their children . " Three men sometimes lived together in one household with one woman " without suspicion of jealousy . " Those multiple marriage arrangements were sometimes extended so as to include Russian settlers as accepted members in the partnership . All this might easily appear mere licentious depravity and laxity on the part of those savages , who were in the Stone Age when first visited by Europeans . Admiral Wrangell remarks that only a few years after the arrival of the Russians they had become Russianized , and had so entirely lost their native traditional customs , that it was quite useless to inquire what they really were . At the present day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many Aleutian villages and of their inhabitants differs little from that of a western township in the United States . To see the natives sitting on the verandas of their wooden cottages , the mother , maybe with her blouse-sleeves tucked up doing the week 's washing , or putting the finishing touches to their children 's toilet before they go to Sundayschool , one would consider those people to be no nearer to a primitive social state than the European immigrants in the little colonies . In those circumstances we should scarcely be entitled to hope that any investigation could bring to light more definite particulars concerning their social organization . Yet such an investigation has been successfully carried out under the auspices of the Russian Geographical Society by the well-known ethnologist , Mr. Wlademar Jochelson . To his intense surprise he found not only that in former times it was an established rule for younger brothers to have access to the wives of their elder brothers , but that even at the present day among these Europeanized natives " the institution is preserved among cousins , and ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as an obligatory one . To participate in group marriage is the duty of cousins . " Sexual Hospitality It will be well to pause here for a moment and consider how it is that participation in group-marriage , which we are in the habit of regarding as a form of licentious disorder , should be regarded not only in the light of a right and a privilege , but actually as a moral obligation . The reason is in reality quite clear and simple . Community of wives being originally part of the relation of tribal brotherhood , it was naturally regarded as an essential token of that relation ? that is , a man could not be truly a tribal brother unless that reciprocal access to wives existed . To primitive man all men are either tribal brothers or strangers , and the latter term is equivalent in primitive society to " enemy " ; there is no middle status between those two opposite relations . If a  | man , not being by birth a tribal brother , is admitted into the community , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good will or affection or admiration ? if , in short , he is not an enemy ? he must needs be a tribal brother . Hence the sacredness of hospitality in all primitive sentiment ; a man who has been admitted to the relation of guest is necessarily to be regarded and treated as a tribal brother . If a man has touched the tent-rope of an Arab 's tent his life must be defended against all enemies , and to tell an Arab that he has neglected his guest is the greatest of insults . The hospitality of savages knows no bounds ; if they are on the verge of starvation they will give the little that they have to the stranger who has been admitted to their midst . The guest who is not by birth a tribal brother must be made one , since he is not an enemy . The first thought of the savage when a stranger to whom he feels himself attracted is in his company , is to take the necessary steps to make him a tribal brother . When a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their first anxiety was to paint on his face the tribal marks . The bloodbond is insisted on whenever a traveler makes a stay in an African , American or Polynesian tribe ; an exchange of blood must be effected so as to make the man who is not treated as a stranger or enemy a tribal brother . In Australia , if a member of a strange tribe refuses to drink the blood of his hosts , it is forcibly poured down his throat . Among the Koryak the guest is obliged to undergo a somewhat strange rite of brotherhood with his host 's wife before he can avail himself of her hospitality . It follows that the participation of the guest in his host 's wife is a necessary token of his friendship , a " friend " being necessarily a tribal brother . The practice , very inaptly called " hospitality prostitution , " is not a matter of misguided benevolence , but a necessary pledge that the guest is a friend and not an enemy . For the guest to refuse is equivalent to repudiating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . The sedentary Koryak , for example , " look upon  | it as the truest mark of friendship , when they entertain a friend , to put him to bed with their wife or daughter ; and a refusal of this civility they consider as the greatest affront , and are capable of even murdering a man for such contempt . That happened to several Cossacks , before they were acquainted with the customs of the people . " The same thing is reported of the Chukchi . In Madagascar a missionary closely escaped being murdered because he refused the proffered hospitality . I have heard of similar perils incurred by missionaries in New Zealand , in the early days , from the same cause . Even the very free sexual hospitality of the natives of Tahiti was , M. Lesson remarks , regarded in the light of a ceremony partaking of a religious character . The custom is very general in all primitive societies . From the manner in which it is regarded we may be as certain as we can be of any inference in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formerly , considered to imply sexual communism , for it is by assimilation to a clan-brother that the guest is treated as he is . All hospitality , which among primitive peoples organized in clans is so liberal and ungrudging as to excite the admiration of Europeans , has its foundation in the assimilation of the guest to a clan-brother . The practice of sexual hospitality has naturally tended to become modified and limited , in the same way as sexual communism has become modified : and limited , with the development of individual marriage and its growing claims . All manner of transitional and attenuated modifications of the custom are accordingly found . Thus , the Missouri Indians were , like many North American tribes , so averse to any intercourse with members of : another tribe , that they never offered their wives or daughtters to strangers , not even to their close neighbors , the Mandans . Nevertheless , they regarded themselves as being under the obligation of offering sexual hospitality to a guest , and accordingly provided him with a captive from some other tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise between their strongly endogamic tribal prin-  | ciples and their equally strong conviction that a clan-brother was entitled to access to his fellow-clansman 's or host 's women . Among the Krumir Berbers a stranger visiting the tribe is received and lodged by one of the tribesmen , and is invited to spend the night in his tent in the company of his host 's wife . The host leaves the tent , but he mounts guard outside it , armed with his gun , and should he hear the slightest suspicious movement on the part of his guest , he would have no hesitation in instantly shooting him . Socalled " hospitality prostitution " has here dwindled down to an empty ceremonial which preserves the form of the social tradition , while safeguarding more advanced sentiments by abolishing the reality of the usage . Among the Arabs the cult of hospitality amounts to an article of religious faith , and , as is usually the case , is associated with an equally fervent devotion to the sentiment of clan-brotherhood and solidarity , which may be said to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs are at the present day , and have long been , intensely patriarchal in their conceptions , while passionately devoted to their women , and in the fullest sense of the term jealous of them and of their honor . From the importance of the conceptions of hospitality and clan-brotherhood among them we should , however , be disposed to infer , on comparative grounds , that at some former time hospitality amongst them included sexual hospitality , and that therefore sexual communism among clan-brothers was also at some former period a custom of their forefathers . In this instance we are able to check the inference , and we have evidence that it is , in fact , entirely justified . The learned Arab jurist , ' Ata ibnAbi Rabah , states that the custom of offering one 's wife to a guest was of old a universally sanctioned and recognized custom survived in historical times , and indeed , ha5. survived amongst some down to the present , or quite recent , times . The Asir tribe , up to the time of the Wahhabites , lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dhahaban Among the Merekedes , a tribe of the Yemen , " custom re .
