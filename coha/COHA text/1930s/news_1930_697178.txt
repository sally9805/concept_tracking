txt Palmer Canfield , former prohibition administrator , who is now legal adviser of the Prohibition Bureau for the Northeastern States , Wilt 60. pended from office yesterday : without pay on order of Prohibition Commissioner James M. Doran in Washington . Iteanwhile , . United States Attorney Tuttle , beginning a sweepling investigation of alleged corruption in the enforcement unit , issued subpoenas for twenty witnesses returnable before a Federal grand jury next Wednesday . The investigation , the first of its kind to be instituted by the United States Attorney in this district , followed , the conviction Thursday night of eight promoters and employes of the Columbia County Cereal Company , operators of a brewery in Hudson , N. Y. , who were found guilty of conspiracy and violation of the prohibition laws . Canfield , who conferred in Washington with Commissioner Doran , sent word to New York that he would waive immunity and appear voluntarily before the grand jury to deny- all charges or implications in the testimony involving him . Earlier in the day Commissioner Doran had demanded his resignation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear himself of the charges . During the trial of the brewery promoters and employes , twelve of whom were acquitted , Joseph F. Walsh , Republican leader of Newburg , testified that Michael A. Devasto and George H. Burt , according to the story they told him , had made " arrangements " with Canfield to obtain a near-beer permit and that either $10,000 or $20,000 had " disappeared " from-a table in the Hotel Roosevelt on Dec. 15 , 1928 , while they conferred there with Canfield , who had just been appointed administrator for the Albany district . Devasto and Burt , alleged ringleaders of the conspiracy , were convicted , and Mr. Tuttle , announcing that his investigation would be based on Walsh 's testimony , pointed out that the jury evidently had believed that the two men had given the witness this information . To Investigate Walsh , Too . Mr. Tuttle indicated that he would also investigate Walsh 's testimony that he , Walsh , had been induced to use his political influence in an effort to obtain a permit for the same defendants when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Cereal Beverage Company . , That ' influence " was evidently less than Walsh himself . had hoped , for , according to his testimony , Maurice Campbell , administrator for the Southern District of the State , not only declined to issue a permit , but caused one of his investigators to send a report on Devasto to the United States ' Attorney " for further investigation . " Walsh ' gave his testimony last Tuesday after pleading guilty to the indictment against him , in which he was named as president of the Columbia company . He was formerly chairman of the Republican ' committee of the city of Newburgh . 2 Tells of - Confession . Mr. Tuttle explained his investigation in the following statement : " Theoriginal indictment in the - Columhia County Cereal Beverage Company case was filed in October , 1929 , /within thirty days after- the raid on the company 's plant . Joseph F. Walsh , president of the company , did not give us his confession until Feb. 25 , 1930 . He . repeated that confession on the witness stand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a permit had been issued to the company , and while Mr. Palmer Canfield was ' prohibition administrator-to-be , ' Michael A. Devasto , one of the principals in this business , told him that ' arrangements ' had already been made with Canfield for the issue of a permit , and also told him that at a meeting between Devasto , George H. Burt and Mr. Canfield at the Hotel Roosevelt a large sum of money had been laid on the table and had then ' disappeared . ' " Walsh also testified that after the permit had been granted by Mr. Canfield , Burt told him the same thing . We believed , when we called Walsh to the stand , that Devasto and Burt had , in fact , made these statements to Walsh. : " We believe that the jury apparently so believed , also . Obviously , however , those statements by Devasto and Burt to Walsh were not , in themselves , justification , legal or otherwise , for the indictment or conviction of any one eXcept DeVasto and Burt . " It now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burt to Walsh were true or not true . The road is now clear for pushing with determination the inquiry which we had already begun on this subject and today over twenty grand jury subpoenas Will be issued with a view to a thorough investigation of the evidences of graft with which this case was rife . In order that no injustice may be done , we will extend to any one who wishes to exercise it the right to appear before our grand jury and to bring witnesses , provided only that immunity be waived . " The conviction of the Devasto gang brings to book a criminal organization , the members of which have been dealers in graft and corruption even more freely than in contraband and have , as to many of them , previous criminal records . " The concluding paragraph of this statement evidently referred to the testimony during the trial of Louis S. Wood , bookkeeper of the company , who explained that an entry of $30,720 on the books referred to " protection ! ' paid for at the rate of $4 a half-barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tuttle declined to say who would appear on subpoena , it was considered likely that Albert Cashdollar , vice president of the company , would be an important witness . Cashdollar , according to Walsh , heard Burt tell the story of the meeting with Canfield in the hotel .
