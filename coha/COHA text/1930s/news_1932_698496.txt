txt Will Rogers Gets a Laugh And a New Hope at Geneva To the Editor of The New York Times : GENEVA , Feb . I. ? Well , we are all here ready for disarmament . The first laugh was when the Japanese delegation arrived . I do n't know , but it just struck everybody funny . They have a large bunch and everybody expects to see ' em take over the city and have it under martial law by morning . The younger members of their delegation that started out to the conference have been called back for military service . Our female delegate , Miss Woolley , is the outstanding novelty . I had an hour and a half 's chat with her this afternoon . Did n't know whether to call her Miss , Mrs. Professor , Doctor or what , so I called her " Doc , " and " Doc " and I got along great . I had taken an interpreter , but I did n't need him , but some of my stuff had to be repeat ' ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad in mind . You would like her . Thirty million women of the world have hope and faith in her common sense versus diplomacy . It 's no joking matter getting the world to disarm . Maybe a woman can do it . It 's a cinch men ca n't . So good luck to you " Doc . " Yours , WILL ROGERS .
