From a clear-minded Cleveland diagnostician , Dr. Edward Elbert Woldman , 41 , last week came a simple method of detecting gastrointestinal lesions in from two to six hours . He dissolves a pinch of the common cathartic , phenolphthalein , in a third of an ounce of alcohol , dilutes it with two-thirds of an ounce of water , has the patient drink the mixture on an empty stomach . If the mucous lining of the intestinal tract is in the least eroded , the phenolphthalein quickly seeps into the blood stream. * The harmlessly adulterated blood in due course swishes through the kidneys , leaving a residue of phenolphthalein to trickle into the bladder with the urine . Phenolphthalein turns pink when mixed with an alkaline substance like sodium hydroxide . So when Dr. Woldman drops sodium hydroxide into an ulcerated or cancerous individual 's urine , the urine turns an indicative pink . For patients too sick for roentgenological study , or in cases where X-ray can not distinguish between old lesion scars and new lesions , Dr. Woldman 's technique is valuable . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract , Dr. Woldman at present is trying to devise a measure of the lesion 's size . Wrote he : " There is some evidence that the quantity of phenolphthalein excreted may have a relation to the size of the lesion . " <P> <P> * The phenolphthalein would , of course , penetrate any lesion in the mucosa . To test for intestinal lesion a patient who had a carcinoma of the mouth , Dr. Woldman piped the drug by that lesion through a straw .
