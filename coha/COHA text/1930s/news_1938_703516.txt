txt Julius Williams , a red-haired Negro election captain for Tammany District Leader James J. Hines , was jailed as a material witnog ? yesterday after he had accused the office of District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of duress and denied that he had testified before a grand jury that his political boss got him a $30-i-week job in the policy racket . He was taken to the Tombs after his bcfrd of . $500 was raised to $10,000 by Supreme Court Justice Ferdinand Pecora at the end of the fourth day of Hines 's trial . The two and a half hours that he spent on the witness stand before Justice Pecora and a blue-ribbon jury hearing evidence that Hines was a leading figure of the Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer policy gang produced one surprise after another . Called as " Short Witness " He had been called as one of the " short witnesses " ? Mr. Dewey had indicated that he had about fifty whose testimony would take fifteen minutes or less  --  to testify that in 1932 he had asked- Hines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 351 Lenox Avenue to see George Weinberg , and had been put on the payroll at ; 30 a week with little to do . This was supposed to have been just prior to the 1932 election . He did not testify to that , but instead , under ' the examination of Assistant District Attorney Sol . Gelb , denied it flatly . Confronted with a statement signed by him , he said he could not read , although he could write when someone gave him the letters to put down . He did not know all the alphabet , he said , only the letters " from A to Z. " But he could not read what he had written , a short inter-linear correction in a typewritten page , although he identified it as his handwriting . Ile Charges Intimidation Lloyd Paul Stryker , chief of defense counsel , cross-examined him on the statement and brought from Williams a story to the effect that the Words had been put in his mouth , by Mr. Gelb and Assistant District ' Attorney Frank S. Hogan . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the ring who has turned State 's evidence , to intimidate him further . Then he listened while Mr. Dewey , read a long transcript of his testimony before a grand jury ? which repeated , in question-and-answer form , the story in the statement ? and denied that he had made the answers recorded by the grand jury stenographer . To Justice Pecora he explained that where the grand jury stenographer had recorded him as saying one thing , he had actually said the opposite . Livens Dull Trial Day His testimony came at the end of a comparatively dull trial day . Wilfred Brunder , a former policy banker in Harlem , had opened the morning session with testimony to the effect that he had joined the racket , or " combination , " as he called it , receiving $100 a week as a controller and dealing with J. Richard ( Dixie ) Davis , who has pleaded guilty and will testify against Hines ; Abe Landau , who. was killed with Schultz in Newark in 1935 , and other members of the gang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court record of a hearing in Magistrate 's Court , pieced together a story of justice as administered by the late Magistrate Francis 3 .

All three testified that two policemen walked into the bank when it was in gull operation , with some twenty-six persons engaged in sorting out and tallying the thousands of slips .

" ith questions like that by Mr. ker , Williams went on to testihat ' Weinberg had said to him , by do n't you say yes , you Were up for the job ?

" Stryker asked . hey brought him out , yes , sir , " witness said . // in the room Were Defended by Davis All three had testified that t did not get bondsmen , but w bailed out and that they did get lawyers , but that Davis peered to defend them . Magistrate Erwin was one of judicial officers named by Dewey as having been " intimida influenced or bribed " by Hines providing the racket the protect it had . The stage was hardly prepa for so stubborn a witness as Ju Williams turned out to be . He large man , his face dotted freckles and his hair distinctly He has a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said . For the first few minutes he just another witness . Mr. brought out that he had been b in Orangeburg , S. C. , and cam New York in 1907 , and that in he had been convicted of a po violation . Those in the court r got a laugh when Williams repl in answer to a question , " What you do after you were convicte Williams replied , " I did si days . " Williams looked surprise He then testified that in 1932 was in the barber shop busi with a friend named Claude Bo He was not a barber but he j sat around , occasionally acting cashier . Met Hines at Polls In 1935 Williams testified that he k Hines , and had met him at the p in 1935 , which was the point which Mr. Gelb began to be prised . He produced statement that had been signed in his office by Williams , and the witness identified his signature . By questioning it was shown that Williams had been brought down to the office of the District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan and a statement dictated . " Then you read this statement , did you not ? " " I ca n't read . " " You wrote in this statement ? " " I did . " " You wrote something in your own handwriting on that statement did you not ? " " I did . " A long argument followed over whether the statement could be used as a basis of interrogation , and whether it could be admitted as evidence . After a conference between the attorneys at the bench , Mr. Gelb resumed his examination . His questions were based on the material contained in the statement . Williams denied that he had spoken to Hines at the Monongahela Democratic Club , the regular organization club of the Eleventh Assembly District , which is Hines 's , in 1932 , or had met him at that time . He also denied that he had asked Hines to help him get a job . Then , one after another , he answered " no " to a long- String of questions by Mr. Gelb , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had Williams come back twice and then sent him to 351 Lenox Avenue , one flight up , to see George Weinberg ; that Weinberg had given him a job , paying him $30 , and that he had been around for several months with little to do . The interlined sentence in Williams 's handwriting was eventually revealed as " At times I picked up some packages for him . " " You wrote this . did n't you ? " Mr. Gelb demanded . " You told me how to write it , " Williams answered . Before admitting the paper in by Mr. Gelb and Mr. Hogan to read . He said he looked at it but did not tell them that he could not read . Under Mr. Stryker 's examination there emerged , created more by tone of voice than the words used , the picture of Williams in an office with a man standing behind him telling him to sign the paper . " Now this man that was standing behind you , what , if anything , did he do ? " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and stamped it . " Those in the court room broke into laughter . Mr. Stryker went on : " Did Mr. Gelb shout at you with the voice that he has been using here in examining you , as loud as that or louder ? " " He was as loud as that , yes , sir . " " So it must have been loud , indeed , in that small room ; is that right ? " " Yes , sir , absolutely . " " Did any one threaten you , at all ? " " He said I would go to jail if I did n't tell the truth . " Williams identified Mr. Gelb as the person who had said that . After much more examination , most of it to the same effect , Mr. Stryker objected to the admission of the statement on the ground that the witness could not read and scarcely could write , and on the ground that " the circumstances under which it appears to have been executed were not voluntary but were the result of duress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The next step was a spectacular examination by Mr. Dewey . His voice was cutting , sharp and merciless . Time after time he put Williams in a job that required some ability to read . The witness said he had once taken a. civil service examination . " And you ca n't read ? " Mr. Dewey asked . Reading Ability Not Required Williams said it was a long time ago and he did not have to be able to read to take the examination for a. job lifting ashes . Mr. Dewey asked him how he could be a collector in the numbers game without being able to read , and he said he had his brother read the slips he collected for him . Finally , he testified that in his work as an election district captain for Hines he took some one along to do his reading for him . Page after page of his testimony before the grand jury was read back to him . At the end of every group of questions Mr. Dewey asked him if he had given that testimony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all over again with the business of being sent to Weinberg at 351 Lenox Avenue by Hines  --  and later when Justice Pecora demanded to know what he had said in the grand jury room , he replied that he made answers opposite to those recorded in ; the minutes from which Mr. Dewey was reading . At Prosecutor 's Office Twice It developed also that he had been to the District Attorney 's office twice in all , once on the day on which he signed the statement and the second time to go before the grand jury . Toward the end Williams denied that he had talked to any one about his testimony before the grand jury , and Mr. Dewey demanded ; " How did Mr. Stryker know you had invented this story to tell that he asked you about here today ? " An objection by Mr. Stryker to the form of the question was sustained , and Mr. Dewey asked : " Do you know how Mr. Stryker got this story that you thought up to tell about the first and second days you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . you were ? " " I do n't know Mr. Stryker . " Finally Mr. Stryker cleared it all up with a question . " When you say to His Honor 's question , and you have said it several times to Mr. Dewey , too , that you did not testify to those things , is what you mean to say that you do not remember whether you did . or not ? " " I do n't remember , yes , sir . " Shortly afterward the jury was excused and a long conference at the bench followed . Justice Pecora announced at the end that on the motion of the District Attorney he had revoked the bail of $500 under which Williams had been free as a material witness and ordered him held in bail of $10,000 . Williams was taken to the Tombs . Hines , glancing at the clock , got up and left the court room while the conference was on . and the persona rested . Mr. Gelb read the record of their ' hearing before Magistrate Erwie t the jurors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the most part , and Osmissed the entire lot , one by orm because he insisted no crime had ' been established . Mr. Stryker 4 ? Er lowed Brunder and the three who ' followed him to leave the star** without cross-examination.
