txt President Hoover was described at the White House today as being highly pleased with the manner in which= the principal industries of the country have supported him in his determination that wage scales shall be maintained during the , business depression . The statement was in answer to reports , published in several newspapers this morning , that the President had become aware of an organized effort in certain quarters to force a reduction , and that he was carrying on a struggle " behind the scenes " to maintain wage levels . Reports attributed to the White House were that the chief pressure for a wage reduction was coming from a source described as " the bankers . " Representations made on behalf of the President took no direct issue with the published statements , but merely called attention to Mr. Hoover 's stand at the outset of the business decline , that wages should be maintained at American levels . Early in the depression the President called conferences of business leaders and urged upon them the necessity of keeping wages up for at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President are said to have been carried out entirely to his liking . Continues Earlier Policy . Mr. Hoover , it was said , will continue to advocate high wage scales . It was emphasized that there had been no major strikes , no general wage reductions and no social disorders , a result which was attributed by President Green of the American Federation of Labor to President Hoover 's quick action in " pegging " wages at the high levels . In contrast ' to the stand taken by the President Representative Wood of Indiana , chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee , declared today that either wages must come down or commodity prices must be increased . Mr. Wood made his statement as he emerged from Mr. Hoover 's private office , but said that he did not discuss the subject with the President . " The wage level in this country , " Mr. Wood declared , " is far above the selling level of commodities . How that is to be adjusted is a problem . Those things naturally adjust themselves after a while just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Representative of Alabama , Democratic whip of the House , in a statement issued , through his party 's national committee , called upon President Hoover to identify the private institutions which are said to be seeking to lower the wage scale : " The garrulous ghost of the White House spokesman is walking again , " Mr. said . " That disem ; bodied ectoplasmic presence *that stalked across the pages of the newspapers so incessantly during the Coolidge administration manifested its return today in most of the journals that are represented in the White House corps of correspondents . " According to the leader of the Hoover press , ' persons who have talked with President Hoover since his return from his Caribbean trip say that he is carrying on a struggle behind the scenes , as It were , to maintain wages at their present level in the face of a strong movement in financial circles to lower them in proportion to the decline in commodity prices . ' " It will be news to most people that there has been any definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stories give the source of the idiotic proposition against which the President is represented to be conducting such a desperate battle . Vaguely , it is intimated that ' the bankers ' are striving to have wages lowered and one or more of the newspapers record that in certain unnamed industries the effect of wage reductions was being accomplished by a diminution of personnel . Hits Government as Employer . " According to current reports , the chief employing Institutions conspicuous in this subterfuge have been the United States Postoffica Department and the United States Navy . Moreover , judging from certain correspondence between the government and the officials of the . Federation of Labor , the workers ' complaint has been largely that the government has been giving contracts to institutions notoriously addicted to paying less than the prevailing wage scale . " If President Hoover is cognizant of any organized effort to cut wages , he would be doing a public service by making public the identity of the private institutions that are so conducting themselves as to inspire him to the desperate warfare which the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surface indications have been visible . " Otherwise it is to be feared that people will see in the incident the erection of a straw man to serve as the target for the Presidential spear and war club , with a political , rather than an economic , purpose in mind . " The suggestion is made in today 's publications that the President thinks that if the present wage scale is maintained undefiled until next June , all our business will be on the upgrade within sixty days . That prophecy has an-uncomfortable reminiscent reflex , for it will be remembered that on March 8 of last year President Hoover set sixty days for the duration of the panic , and the expiration of that period was marked by a terrific additional crash in the prices of securities and commodities . " A heartening note was sounded today by William Green , president of the American Federation of Labor , in commenting on employment , when be disclosed that a slight improvement had been noted in March as compared to February . He said that the improvement was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high level ; " with no prospect for more than gradual improvement in the near future . " - Seasonal Gains Recorded . " Employment improved again slightly in March , according to reports from our unions , " said Mr. Green . " The gain in March was about the same as that in February . Our weighted unemployment figures show 18.2 per cent unemployed in March , as compared to 19 per cent in ? February and 19.8 per cent in January . " Although the improvement from February to March is small , it is quite in keeping with the usual seasonal gains at this time of year . Last year unemployment in March was worse than in January ; after the hard Winter of 1928 , the improvement from January to March was less than it has been this year . Only in the prosperous year of 1929 was there a greater gain than this year . " While the March figures are encouraging in that they show a normal seasonal gain , no industry as yet shows a definite upward tendency in employment of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trades since the February peak , but 28 per cent are still out of work and 27 per cent on part time . " In ? clothing and textile industries , employment gains were substantial , as is usual at this season , but 25 per cent were still out of work in March and 40 per cent on part time . In manufacturing and on railroads there were very slight improvements . Adjustments Are Still Being Made . " In some other trades , however , adjustments are still in process . In trade and service industries this is marked , for street transport trades and our miscellaneous trade and service group both showed more out of work in March . " In printing , unemployment increased again and reached a new high peak ; there has been no substantial improvement in printing since January , 1930 , and unemployment has been growing almost steadily worse . " In building , the Spring pick-up which sometimes begins in March has not yet started in March of this year , and 52 per cent of the building trades membership were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at a very high level , with no prospect for more than gradual improvement in the near future . On the basis of the government census of unemployment in nineteen cities in January Secretary Lamont estimated that , 6.050,000 were without jobs and from 250,000 to 300,000 on temporary lay-off , making a total of about 6,300,000 without work . Considering the small improvement since January , the number out of work is probably still near the 6,000,000 mark . Unemployment Compared by Years .
