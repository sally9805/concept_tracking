txt While a thousand searchers ready to shoot it out sought kidnapped June Robles in the canyons and desert wastes surrounding this city tonight , authorities branded as spurious a second note reducing the ransom demand from 515,000 to $10,000 . With the announcement scores of police , sheriff 's deputies , ranchers and quick-shooting cowboys widened the hunt for the 6-year-old girl to the hills outside the city , a block-by-block and house-to-house canvass in the city having proved in vain . The child , granddaughter of a pioneer Spanish rancher , Bernabe Robles , was abducted yesterday as she was returning home from school . No authentic word has come from the kidnappers , according to Colby S. Farrar , under-sheriff in charge of the search , since the original demand for $15,000 was placed in the hands of Fernando Robles , June 's father , two hours after she disappeared . Contact Is Hoped . Mr. Farrar said investigators had hoped a contact might be had with the abductors before morning and some agreement as to the ransom payment reached , in an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divulge neither the time nor the place a contact attempt was to be made . As the search for the kidnappers widened beyond the confines of Tucson , firm-visaged ranchers and be-spurred cowpunchers , schooled in the lore of the hills and the desert country where rustlers once were hunted down and hanged , took over the bulk of the work . Threats of lynching , in the event of capture of the abductors , were heard . To lend impetus to the search , rewards totaling $1,000 were offered ? $500 by the Morgan Post of the American Legion and $500 by the Pima County Board of Supervisors . Every residence in the city was visited by men with ready guns in their hands . Members of the American Legion assumed the stationary patrols , and , with reserve officers out in uniform with sidearms , they gave the inner city the appearance of a military reservation . An airplane was ordered into " the hunt by Carlos G. Robles , Assistant County Attorney and uncle of the child . He recalled that a plane had aided greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon Sawyer , Tucson banker , two years ago . Two men and a woman were believed by authorities to be involved in the seizure of little June , although they did not indicate whether there were clues to their identity . The officers reasoned , however , that the services of a woman would be necessary to take care of the child if the abductors kept her indefinitely . There were a few other clues . A woman living in the isolated Fort Lowell section of the city said she heard the screams of a child about 9:30 o'clock last night , before she learned of the abduction . She had thought a child was being punished . Another clue , details of which were kept secret , came from a deaf mute , who informed Under-Sheriff Farrar by writing a note . It was understood the mute , whose name I was not disclosed , had observed a man sitting in an automobile near the Robles home early yesterday . A woman told investigators today she unwittingly witnessed the kidnapping yesterday . The incident occurred near Roskruge School , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my son , " Mrs. Harold D. Smith said , " when I saw a tall , emaciated looking man , with enormous sun glasses , beckoning to June to get in his car . " I though he might be a relative . " Mrs. Smith said the man was white , appearing to be about 40 years old , with a thick growth of beard . Bernabe Robles , who because of his reputed wealth was regarded as the person at whom the ransom demand was aimed , took a leading part in the hunt today , while the father remained at the Sheriff 's office to be immediately available should more definite clues appear . The mother , Mrs. Helen Robles , was reported near collapse at her home . A college student and two other men were taken into custody last night . The student remained in jail , although officers did not suspect him of connection with the kidnapping . He admitted , police said , that he offered a newsboy $10 to take a note to Bernabe Robles as " a prank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to teach him a lesson . " Governor Moeur ordered the State highway patrol force mobilized in Tucson and considered offering a reward for the capture of the abductors.
