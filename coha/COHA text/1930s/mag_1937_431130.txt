T HE bride the 1937 sun will shine on expects marriage to bring her companionship and security . She believes that $30 a week is the smallest sum on which a man can safely try to support a wife . She has been in love at least once before . And she likes her future mother-in-law ! These are peeps into the mind beneath this year 's tulle and orange blossoms . We got them from the expectant brides themselves . We said , " A postage stamp for your thoughts , " and sent out a list of questions to be answered but not signed . The results came rolling in , in an informative florid from brides all over the country . All kinds of June brides answered the questionnaire . Girls whose envelopes were addressed in a finishingschool script . Girls whose answers came from odd little towns in Idaho and New Jersey and California and Mississippi . Brides who were 17 and brides who were 40 . Sophisticated brides and nervous brides and brides who were not ashamed to blush . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where New York debutantes learn how to manage a formal dinner party for twenty-four and what are the duties of the upstairs maid . Girls connected with some of the oldest ? and most moneyed ? families have gone there : they agreed on $3600 as the minimum yearly income for a marrying man . Other blanks were sent to lists of country brides , provided by the Home Demonstration Agents of the Department of Agriculture . Brides learning homemaking in Works Progress Administration courses were queried , and brides who attended courses for engaged girls at the Girls ' Service League . Out of all their answers comes a picture of what the average bride today is bringing to marriage , and what she expects marriage to bring to her . She is a clear-headed young woman , the girl who is tripping to the altar this month . She is not going into marriage as a lark . She has thought about the mistakes other partners in marriage have made , and she has determined to avoid them . She is taking her financial problems gravely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests which may not be in accord with her own . And she wants to have babies ! The first question on the printed questionnaire which the girls were asked to fill out and return , unsigned was this ,  | " What do you expect from mar-riage ? " It was deliberately framed to be vague and general , to give the girls the greatest possible leeway in answering . And as a result their remarks are extremely enlightening . " Happiness and companionship , " " Companionship and a home , " " Companionship , a good home , and children " ? over and over again that word " companionship " appears , in hundreds of handwritings . It is the word the girls themselves chose to express their dream . Very few of them ? about a sixth ? mention " romance , " and it is usually listed along with other benefits . Many girls put down " security . " Only one says " excitement . " " Romance , battles , and security , " writes a high-spirited girl of 17 . Her husbandto-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting them all before she 's through ! " I expect devotion , love , fidelity , companionship , " writes one girl from midtown New York , " with ups and downs . I expect to do more than my share to make it last . " " A full , happy life with economic and social security , " writes a girl of 18 from Chicago 's North Side . " Prestige and a man , " says a bride of 35 , who is marrying a man of 40 . " Do you consider marriage a lottery ? Do you believe a happy marriage is the result of good luck ? " This was the second question . The brides-to-be answered with an emphatic No ! " No , " say several of the girls , " we have to work for happiness . " And : " No . I consider happiness the result of intelligent planning . " Only a fugitive handful of the brides feel that they are turning their future over to blind fate when they murmur , " I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they can write anything they wish . ' hey take the responsibility for their future on their own capable young shoulders . Finances are an important factor in marriage plans these days . During the depression , all of us were made uncomfortably aware of the fact that many young couples who should rightly marry and settle down were kept apart by the inability of the boy to get a job . This problem is being solved . Government statisticians expect a bumper crop of brides this year , and they are willing to plan on a very frugal future in order to set up a home . Girls in the smaller cities and towns think that $1200 a year is quite enough for a courageous couple to embark on . Girls from larger cities place the figure a little higher , in most instances . Only a few of the brides from the well-to-do sections of the larger cities place the figure as high as $50 a week , although a few of these mention $4500 as the minimum on which a man should marry . Strangely enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband are the ones who plan to earn more money themselves in jobs outside the home . Very few of the girls who believe marriage desirable on $25 a week answered " Yes " to the third question . This was : " Do you intend to work at a job outside the home after marriage ? If so , is this from economic necessity or choice ? " The responses from the larger cities showed that almost as many brides in these centers planned to hold jobs as not . Most of them softened their answers with qualifying phrases : " For a while " ; " Until the children come " ; " Only until my husband 's salary is larger . " Some of the girls plan to take work into the home and to increase their income in this way . Almost none of the rural brides expect to work at jobs . It is interesting , to those who have followed the feminist movement , to see that less than a tenth of the brides plan to keep jobs  | outside the home from choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the money . Can it be that the modern woman 's desire for a job for its own sake has been exaggerated ? Whatever ambitions this year 's bride may have , they will not take her downtown to an office and to an executive 's chair ! She will , on the other hand , have children . The number she hopes to have varies from two to four ( one girl writes " flocks " ) . " What sex do you want your first baby to be ? " About half the brides do n't care . Of the others , a few more hope for girls than for boys . Which explodes the old-fashioned belief that every woman wants her first child to be a son ! The next two questions could not have been addressed to brides twenty-five years ago . They were included because the courses on Marriage and Motherhood which are now offered in so many schools and colleges have prepared the young women of today to face the physical problems of marriage in a realistic manner . The questions were : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Have you a clear idea of the marriage act ? If so , where did you obtain the information ? " To the first question , no girl answered " Yes , " although five or six left it blank . One girl wrote , " There are times in every woman 's life when she does shrink from the physical side , and other times when it is the fulfillment of joy and happiness . " The vast majority of the girls answered with a simple " No . " A less overwhelming majority ? about four-fifths ? of the girls answered the question on sex information in the affirmative . Nearly all of them said that they had obtained this information from books or magazines . A few scattered replies mention " My mother , " " Friends , " " An older sister , " " Campus discussions , " as the source . Only one of all those questioned had learned the facts of marriage from a physician . " How long had you known your fiance before becoming engaged ? " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortest period ) to " We grew up together . " Few of the girls became engaged until they had known the man for at least a year . " Who did the proposing ? " brought out a great many staunch replies of " He did it . " A small fraction of the brides explain that it was a matter of " mutual consent " or that " both took part . " No bride admits to having proposed herself . THE financial side of marriage is one on which engaged couples do not usually dwell ; it is difficult , in their enraptured planning , to foresee any occasion on which they might quarrel over money . But this year 's brides have become hardheaded in the course of the depression years . They are not leaving the allotment of the family income to chance , but are making plans for its division now . " Do you expect to receive an allowance from your husband , or to share a joint bank account , or to let him pay the bills ? " was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share a joint account with their husbands . Instead , this year 's brides hope to get an allowance which they may spend at their own discretion . A few expect to take over the whole financial management of the home ? a system , by the way , which many bankers encourage . About one-tenth of the girls belong to their grandmothers  | school ; they want their husbands to handle ' all the finances and to pay all the bills . And over half of the girls ? with their heads filled with showers and trousseaus ? are still able to answer " Yes " to the question , " Have you made a budget of housekeeping expenses ? " The brides who were forced to answer " No " often added a guilty little postscript , saying they planned to do so right away ! The bride of 1937 believes that husbands and wives should take vacations apart ? but not too often , mind you ! The question asked the girls to say how often these marital vacations should occur and how long they should last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not for very long , but quite often , " says another , a girl of 21 in New York City . It is the metropolitan brides who stress the need for frequent vacations ; they believe , on the whole , that husbands and wives should separate for one month a year or should spend two two-week vacations apart . Some of them urge a separation " Whenever either one desires it " ; some , " Whenever we get on each other 's nerves . " Brides in small towns and farming communities either do not want vacations apart or will leave the matter " to circumstances . " WILL any relatives live with you after marriage ? " brought remarkably few answers in the affirmative . About one-sixth of the girls expect to have their mothers or their mothers-in-law live with them . Others answer with vague " Maybe 's " and " According to the circumstances . " A number of brides apparently feel strongly on this matter : " I hope not , " and " Positively , no ! " and " None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the girls are determined on this point . And there are a number of psychologists who would agree that they are quite right in fighting to protect their marriage from even the most kindly interference . " No home is large enough for two families , " is an old saying . " Do you know how to cook ? " the girls were asked . The answers are predominantly and cheerfully in the affirmative . The brides of this year will detour around the burned-biscuits crisis which used to form a part of every girl 's early married life . And even the brides who answer " No , " in most cases add " I 'm going to learn " or " I 'm taking lessons . " " Do you and your fiance quarrel when you are partners at bridge ? " was included , because of the widespread belief that this situation is the acid test of any couple 's ability to get along . Considering that these girls are very much in love , it is surprising to find that nearly half of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't quarrel , but we get annoyed , " says one girl . " Too often , " says another . While one cynical miss answers , " Not yet ! " It is the bromidic belief of short-story writers that all brides enter into marriage with the firm intention of making over their bridegroom 's character and habits as quickly as they can . The questionnaire goes surprisingly far toward proving that they are right . The question ran : " Would you make any changes in your fiance 's habits or character ? If so , what ? " Almost none of these hundreds of girls finds her man entirely to her liking , as he stands . The changes they wish to effect are , on the whole , pretty superficial matters . Only one girl writes a minor thesis on the reforms she would like to see ; she says , " I 'd like to have him develop a more mature point of view , which would reflect itself in his actions ? have him  | become more progressive in thought along all subjects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . " Another girl lays stress on the method she will use to change her husband ? " I 'll do it very subtly . " Other complaints cover a wide range of masculine shortcomings : " He 's too quiet " ; " I would like to change many of his nervous habits and mannerisms " ; " I want him to learn to take life easier " ; " I hope to teach him to be a more appreciative host , and less absent-minded " ; " I wish he 'd stop eating so much between meals " ; " He asks too many questions " ; " He says he snores . " These girls , whatever you may say against them , have definite ideas on what transformation they hope to effect . May they spare their husbands ' feelings in the process ! " Do you expect your husband to spend any of his leisure time at hobbies in which you do not share ? " To this question , the answers were almost unanimously " Yes . " Some of the brides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , " Absolutely , " " I hope he does , " to the more selfish answers of two 17-year-old brides : " Yes , if they bore me " and " Yes , for I may have some hobbies he wo n't share with me . " Human nature , even among engaged girls , is not uniformly perfect . To the question , " Have you and your fiance the same religion ? " the answer is predominantly " Yes . " Only one-fourth of the girls answered the question otherwise , and their responses include such phrases as : " No , but we are both Protestants " ; " No , but we will compromise the differences . " Differences in religion do not crop up among the older brides ? all the girls who disagree with their fiances on this point are under 24 . THAT brings up the matter of the marrying age . Many writers and sociologists have expressed concern over the effect of the long-drawn-out depression on our youngsters ' marriage plans . What would happen , they asked , to boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man found employment ? Would their love stand the test of this delay ? The answer seems to be that it has . About one-fourth of the questionnaires were signed by brides of from 23 to 29 years old ? girls who report that their engagement has been a matter of two to five years . These are the women who would normally have married soon after the announcement of their engagement . They are also , it is interesting to see , the girls who usually set the most modest sums as the minimum on which a man can afford to marry . They have been waiting for years for their young man 's financial position to improve enough for him to marry , and they are not inclined to hold out for luxuries in their first home . This June will be the month in which many thousands of girls realize the dreams that they have held fast to during the dreary , drab depression years . Having made so many sacrifices for their marriage , they are going to prize it highly and to take pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally bear a wedding ring . Do girls marry their first flames ? Not according to this year 's survey . The questions included , " Were you ever in love with another man ? " and the vast majority of the brides answer with a simple " Yes . " Occasionally a girl temporizes with , " Not really , but I thought I was . " A few say , " No . " A rather astonishingly large number say , " Of course . " Many a young couple have happened upon their first quarrel through a dis- agreement about friends from the husband 's bachelor days . For this reason , one of the questions ran : " Do you disapprove of any of your fiance 's present friends ? If so , on what grounds ? " It was hoped to gather some interesting data on this point , and also to help the brides avert future disagreements by facing the problem now . Less than half the girls answered the question in the affirmative , but those who did seemed to feel strongly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Social , " says another . " I do n't like the personality of some of them , " writes a woman of 29 . " A few , but they are all out of town , " is written with an almost audible sigh of relief . " They drink too much , " appears in more than one of the questionnaires . " Would you rather live , after marriage , in a house , apartment , or hotel ? " brought the expected answer ; most young people dream of owning a home of their own . A few of the brides in large cities preferred an apartment house ; two of the New York girls spoke up for a duplex apartment . But the house received a landslide endorsement , and not one girl , of all those interviewed , preferred life in a hotel . Critics of the modern woman who believe that she wishes to avoid all housekeeping responsibility will please copy ! " What mistakes in your own upbringing would you try to avoid in the case of your children ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which her parents brought her up . Complaints range from the trivial to the serious , but it is interesting to see that the girls who feel they have been spoiled or given too much freedom outnumber the girls who object to a strict upbringing by more than two to one . In many cases the lack of a religious atmosphere in their upbringing is deplored by the very modern brides of 1937 . And more girls used the back of the questionnaire for detailed answers to this question than to any of the others asked : " I should like my children to be taught all the major sports . I 'd want them to travel much . But my main desire is that they shall be able to do at least one thing well with their hands or at least have some talent in which they can express themselves . " " I 'll take care to tell them about sex and such matters , about which I had to find out for myself when I should rather have been informed by my mother . I 'd try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " " I should show a greater respect for the rights of a child , but I 'd never give in to tantrums . " " I 'd keep them from going to dances so young . " " I 'd let them choose their own careers . " " Teach them to think for themselves . " " I 'd try to spare them from developing an inferiority complex like mine . " " There would be far more stress on religion and on objective moral standards . " " I 'd give them far less freedom ; children do n't want to be left to make their own decisions . They want their parents to make them do what 's right . " " Do you consider your parents ' marriage a happy one ? Your fiance 's parents ' ? " was included , since it was felt that many girls might defer marriage until a later age if their childhood had been spent in unhappy homes . This is evidently not true . Four-fifths of the girls consider their own parents ' marriages to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents get along . But the girls who come from unhappy homes are , ap- parently , marrying at a rather younger age than those whose parents are happy . The majority of the brides from unhappy homes are younger than 23 ; this , of course , suggests that sometimes a daughter will marry to escape from an inharmonious atmosphere at home . The last question the girls were asked was , " Do you like your future mother-in-law ? " The comic-strip artists of the next generation may as well abandon this type of joke at once ; nine-tenths of the girls answer " Yes , " and many of them go out of their way to praise the lady . The 1937 mothers-in-law are having a definite success . These are the brides of today , the mothers of tomorrow . They are entering into marriage gravely and with a full understanding of the responsibilities involved . They are inclined to give their young husbands a great deal more leeway than the brides of twenty years ago , but they have their own plans for making over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooms later on . The engaged girls of today have none of the frivolous contempt for the conventions which their older sisters wore like a bright badge where their , hearts should have been . They are not looking toward marriage to provide them with thrills or even with romance . They want a steady , happy companionship with the nice young men with whom they are in love , and they are eager to work and save in order that their little income may give them security and a home . A home , and not an apartment over a delicatessen store . A home where children will be born and will be given the discipline they require . We give a toast to the brides of 1937 ! May they all live to celebrate their golden wedding day !  |
