ZACA VENTURE - William Beebe - Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> When they first encounter the works of Naturalist William Beebe , readers usually have some trouble getting accustomed to the strange cast of characters-the moray eels , zebra gobies , angelfish , filensh. amphipods , triglid fish , bubble shells , blennies , opaleyes , nudibranchs and other odd forms of life he writes about . In the Galapagos Islands , in Bermuda or on the Gulf of California ; everything reminds Naturalist Beebe of the teeming variety of life and the consistency of its patterns of struggle ; in the stomach of a sea bird he finds a half-digested fish , with a smaller fish in its stomach , while mud from the bottom of the sea turns out to be writhing with worms , crabs , starfish , urchins , snails , serpent-stars and heretofore unknown species . Not his best book , Zaca Venture presents the most crowded world so far , since it touches on everything from a 42-foot whale shark ( the largest true fish known ) to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the white breast feathers of the Brewster booby . <P> Zaca Venture tells , with many digressions , of a round-trip cruise of the 118-foot Zaca from San Diego down the coast of Lower California and up the Gulf of California to Guaymas with pauses for dredging , diving , fishing . Although it begins with an account of Beebe 's sensational discovery that there are snipefish on both the east and west coasts of the U. S.-a discovery whose exact scientific importance escapes the lay reader-it quickly gives way to discussions of Mr. Beebe 's first deep-sea fishing , a comparison of the flight of pelicans and cormorants , a spirited defense of vultures and well-chosen excerpts from the works of other naturalists . One of these , Dr. L. H. Matthews ' description of the mating habits of the albatross , reads like something by James Thurber . Albatross mating , it appears , is " no rough-and-tumble affair as with the house spar-row " ; the males " gather around one female and bow to her , bringing the head down close to the ground . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the female bows and groans back at them . " The mysteries and wonders which Naturalist Beebe unearths-his realization that his world of human beings is " only one among a host of many sizes and dimensions of other worlds " - are less stressed in Zaca Venture than in his previous books . And although his bright journalistic style permits little professional dullness , he sometimes drops offhandedly the names of fish so little-known that readers may fear he is pulling their legs . <P> Of some strange creatures on Clarion Island , he writes , " One was unquestionably a mipt ! " * and in the same pool he saw swimming by " a school of friendly old abudefdufs " mingling with pale green surgeons . <P> * A mipt is Dr. Beebe 's word , taken from Lord Dunsany , meaning a weird creature .
