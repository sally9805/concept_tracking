&t:741',4; COLLEGE PRESIDENT BY JOHN R. TUNIS G4THE Executive Committee of the I Associated Alumni : We take it as a fundamental promise that the university 's primary function is its educational and social influence on the undergraduate . The next president of Mammoth should therefore possess qualities of leadership of youth so that he may stimulate their appreciation of culture and their zest for intellectual accomplishments . He should be a young man who can understand young men , certainly not more than fifty years of age , preferably between thirty-five and forty . " Mammoth University wanted a young man and a leader . Henry Kirk Browne was just thirty-eight when he was inaugurated ; no one could deny he was young to be the head of an organization which employed four thousand three hundred deans , assistant deans , professors , associate professors , instructors , tutors , librarians , carpenters , gardeners , chauffeurs , and workmen of all sorts , skilled and unskilled ; which had an endowment of twelve millions ; which spent almost two millions in salaries each year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight hundred boys and girls between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three . A young man for a young college . Mammoth was comparatively young , less than sixty years old . It was a State university , looking to the future , not tradition-bound . Here was a place where changes could be made . At least so Henry Kirk Browne felt when he visited the campus as a possible candidate forthe presidency . He was stirred by the thousands of undergraduates in that vast auditorium , rank after rank reaching up until they were lost in the blackness of the ceiling . That sight was a challenge . He resolved that if he were called to Mammoth he would give them his best , that he would be a leader . Once chosen , he studied carefully the University and its needs . He talked with prominent alumni , with the students , with the faculty , with the board of eight regents whom he met formally and informally , with the young and progressive Governor of that young and progressive State . There were , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intellectual . His ambition was to make Mammoth a real intellectual center . Supported by public funds , it had a responsibility to keep in close touch with the needs of the commonwealth ; but this did not mean it had to be an educational factory . The second problem was athletic and social ; he hoped to loosen the hold of football and extra-curricular activities . Before accepting the job he studied the careers of half a dozen real leaders of educational thought in the United States : Harper of Chicago , Hopkins of Williams , Gilman of Johns Hopkins , Eliot of Harvard . They were leaders , these men , and he observed that they had all accomplished their most vital work in the first five years of their presidencies . During that period each one had shaken up his institution while he was fresh and a powerful factor . Gradually the changes had been made . Progress had slowed up . Here was a lesson to be applied . II It was nearly nine , and he had been at his morning 's mail for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few words or a sentence each , knowing that before dusk Miss Davis would place sixty-two complete answers on his desk , every one amplified from a phrase or a sentence into a paragraph perfect in tone and substance , every demand on his time and energy gracefully evaded . The college president , he reflected , must say " no " all day . He must also say it with regret  --  which is another way of admitting that seventy per cent of his success depends on having a good secretary . Five minutes past nine and his first appointment of the day . The Superintendent of Buildings was an important personage in university circles . Professors greeted him with respect and deans who called him by his first name were few and envied . Half an hour had passed before the problem of how the agricultural college could be connected with the main oil-burning plant at a cost compatible with budget regulations was settled . Meanwhile the head of the Social Science Department was waiting nervously in the anteroom . This was unfortunate because the professor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten ten . The Dean of Men entered with the proofs of the new university catalogue . Dean Terry was an important person in the faculty ; moreover , he was under consideration for the presidency of Pittsburgh , and everyone on the faculty knew this . His wishes had to be met , so the President took the proofs , promising to return them the next morning . The buzzer on his desk clicked . Would he care to talk to the editor of the Daily Express on whether he intended to change coaches after the football team 's recent defeats ? No , he would not . Enter the Dean of Women , breathless . Several undergraduates had been picketing a carpet factory in a neighboring town during a strike , and one girl had worn an M sweater given by a boy on the team . Was n't that outrageous ? What had they better do ? The president felt they 'd better do nothing . Campus opinion would take care of the situation . Mr. J. Harrison Baker , one of the regents who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . An unexpected visitor , he jammed up every appointment as he sat tranquilly smoking a cigar and explaining how different life in the university had been in 1906 . It was one-eighteen when Miss Davis came in with a tray of food . Just ahead lay one of the most critical two hours of President Browne 's career . Already he had appeared before the biennial session of the legislature to ask for his appropriation . That had been a difficult half-hour because on his appearance and presentation of the problem depended the happiness and welfare of thousands of persons connected with the university for the next two years . But he was even more uneasy now because he was about to propose changes in the educational set-up , and faculties instinctively oppose change . Like officers in the army , they are so governed by rules and regulations that any shift in the established order shocks them . To convince that hierarchy would be one of the greatest tasks of his life , and he knew it . The Council was an august body whose approval was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consisted of the heads of the various departments and sixty senior professors , about eighty in all . They sat that afternoon , legs crossed , quietly sucking on their pipes , an excellent picture of an academic hierarchy determined not to let itself be convinced if possible . At the sallies of the eager and intense young man they smiled not ; to his thrusts they were unresponsive . " Why is it , gentlemen , that we lack the real thing in so many American universities ? Is it not because the accumulation of information has been their chief object ? We have not been busy pursuing the truth , but we have been piling up facts and courses on inconsequential subjects . You will find that at present it is possible to study nut culture at Oklahoma , pingpong at Iowa , tap-dancing at Minnesota , broadcasting at Oglethorpe , charm at Carroll , and leisure at Rollins College . The purpose of the changes I am suggesting is not to help our graduates acquire the possessions of the world . That is not , should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faculty , let me assure you that the idea outlined in the memorandum in your hands was not something achieved in haste . It is the result of months of study by the committee appointed last winter , of much research and consultation with educational authorities throughout the country . It is new , but it is not revolutionary . If adopted it will merely be proof that as a young and aggressive institution we are unhampered by tradition . The most important aim of the plan is to raise the standard of college education . There are far too many young people who are here because they do n't know what else to do with their time and money . The plan I am suggesting would keep them apart from the serious students . " I would not prevent these young people from coining to college . I would not turn them back into the world . So we have provided for them a carefully worked out two-year course , at the end of which they would depart with a college certificate . The serious students would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would really mean something . As you are all aware , this is the trend in most real educational institutions throughout the country . I believe that if approved by you and adopted , it would change the attitude of the American undergraduate , that attitude best expressed by former President Lowell as being something like this : ' I am the educator . You are the educatee . Educate me if you can ! ' " III Professor James Durant Davidson of the Department of Romance Languages lived in a small frame house that was just off the campus and had n't been painted since the Coolidge era . His salary had been $3,600 , but since 1931 it had been cut ten per cent like those of all other employees of the Commonwealth . Sitting in a frayed rocker , he was correcting examination papers in Comparative Literature 24b , French Prose and Poetry of the 17th Century , when the telephone rang . " Hullo , James . Have I heard what ? Oh , the Council . They met to-day ? You do n't mean it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand . . . " Right here his wife put down the evening paper and sat up in her rocker , listening eagerly . " What ? No attendance at classes ? No probation either ? Pretty radical steps . . . Two-year terms ! But that means more professors and instructors ; where 's the money coming from ? .. Thinks he can convince the Regents , does he ? Doubt it very much . . . . So do I. Well , he 'll have to submit it to a vote of the faculty , and Terry will stand up for our rights . The faculty of this institution have always had their feet on the ground . Yes , that 's what I say , thank God . . . " While this conversation was taking place a dozen or fifty others like it were going on all over town . Faculty members and their wives were telephoning faculty members and their wives , and do n't imagine the wives were n't interested or able to form an opinion on anything so radical as transforming Mammoth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stone mansion which sheltered the President another storm was brewing . On his invitation six presidents of universities in the Conference had come to dine and discuss the problem of intercollegiate athletics . At his right sat Blair of Indianapolis , tall , dark , direct , a man of many friends and more enemies , a leader adored by his students and fac-ulty because of his liberal attitude , hated alike by Communists and Patrioteers . Next was Case of Southern Illinois , colorless and harmless , a man gifted only in the snaring of endowments ; he had formerly been a Methodist bishop . He was listening to Fielding , the Walter Damrosch of college presidents , bland , kindly spoken , benevolent , a man whose enemies said he had done much for Fielding but not much for education . Next was Shapleigh , who had married a rich New Yorker and played the social game to the limit ; the limit , in the opinion of his faculty , being when he asked them to dine in white ties and tails , thus causing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Kendall , plain , blunt , concealing his force under an approachable manner , with a genius for getting things done ; last , Jamison of Northeastern , accustomed to handling lumbermen and farmers of the north , with an infectious laugh that made you laugh in reply , although there was seldom anything in his remarks to laugh about . President Browne noticed , as he rose , that they were uneasy . They had heard , through the grape-vine route by which news travels in educational circles , that he had proposed changes in the curriculum . This worried them . If by any chance he was successful it would challenge them to act . As if they had n't enough trouble already ! No wonder they were nervous when he started . " Gentlemen , I 've asked you here to-night to discuss the whole problem of our athletics . We all know , even though we seldom admit it except to our wives , that football is , to speak vulgarly , a racket . Case , your team has won  --  how many  --  twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month that you were praying for a defeat , that the thing had got beyond you . Mr. Fielding 's varsity is studded with young men who ought to be playing on professional teams  --  that was n't told me in confidence , was it , Mr. Fielding ? Oh , excuse me . Well , anyway , the Chicago Daily News has been saying this for months . President Shapleigh 's alumni are yelling for the good old days when their alma mater was winning the Conference title ten times in succession . At Northeastern , Mr. Jamison , they tell me Coach Burdick no longer has the confidence of the student body . I notice that the confidence of my own student body ebbs and flows with titles . " The six men about the table smiled unenthusiastically . They felt such sallies were in bad taste . They were uncomfortable . " How are we going to reduce the pressure ? How can we make football a game ? We are agreed that it has degenerated into exhibitionism , that it has no relation to real sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , are we not ? " The agreement was universal but lukewarm . It was as if he had asked them to agree that the human race was a fine institution . Several men stirred uneasily in their chairs . What the devil was he up to ? " Football teams are to a college what colonies are to a great power . They are an advertisement , but like colonies , they often cost more than they bring in . To remedy the situation I suggest three specific changes . First : pay no coach more than four thousand eight hundred dollars , which is I believe the highest salary any head of department makes . This to include all side payments and sums made in ways I wo n't enlarge on . Second : limit participation to junior and senior years . This would defeat transfers of tramp athletes and eliminate boys who have played three years of varsity football without ever reaching the junior year . Third : admit our undergraduates to games free , and if necessary raise the price of seats to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not make them pay for it ? At least that will be honest . " Yes , this will take courage . These changes will not solve all our problems . But they are an attempt to put an end to one of the absurdities of American educational life . I 'm going to ask you to discuss these suggestions at the next meet-ing of your board of regents , and write me your decision within two months . " IV As he propped the newspaper on the breakfast table a headline at the bottom of the page caught his eye . " COMMUNIST TO LECTURE AT STATE UNIVERSITY .. " Without reading farther he knew to what this referred . John Strachey had been asked by a committee of half a dozen radical members of the faculty to lecture at Mammoth . The President was therefore ready for trouble . He was not. , however , ready for his friend the Governor , who walked into the office as he was finishing the morning mail . " Hullo , Rob . " " Good morning , Henry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , Robl We 've often agreed on freedom of speech in the universities . That 's the only question involved . " " Are you quite sure ? This is legislative year when the university gets its appropriations for the next two seasons . I 'm in accord with you but you ca n't run ahead of the crowd  --  and that 's what you 're trying to do in letting Strachey speak . " " How could I stop him ? Suppose I forbid him the use of Robinson Hall . The faculty committee will simply hire a hall off the campus . Besides , this is an institution devoted to the search for truth . . . " " Same old Iine , Henry . Go ahead then . Let him talk . What about your faculty when the legislature calls them a bunch of reds and trims the appropriation so that you have to cut their salaries again ? I remember old Boswell used to come before the finance committee up at the State House in his oldest clothes , with a shiny elbow and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made a hit with the farmers upstate and they gave him whatever he wanted . The job of the university president is to keep out of trouble . He 's the showman and the ringmaster .. . " " I 'm not . I 'm an educator , not a showman . I 'm an administrator , not a ring-master . " " If you 're an administrator , I 'll leave this problem in your Iap . The greatest art of administration is to say no , to make the other man think you are terribly anxious to say yes . That 's what I spend half my time doing . Good-by , Henry . " " Good-by , Rob . . . . Come in , Professor . " James Morton Robertson , one of the older members of the faculty , was his friend . It was Robertson who had known his father and had brought him to the attention of the Regents . There was trouble on the old man 's face . " It 's about Dean Terry , Henry . You 're recommending him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Robertson , that 's one of those unpleasant things I 've been putting off for weeks . I rather think not . " " Oh , but Henry , why not ? " " Weil , my reasons are three . First because he is sixty and too old to be president of a college like . . " " You say that because you 're young . " " Maybe so . I discount this reason , although it has force . There are others . I think the man 's psychological condition is poor . And I do n't think he 's fitted for the work , " " But he 's counting on it . We all expect it . The thing depends on your recommendation now , and he knows it too . " The President leaned over and picked up the big volume of American Men of Science on his desk . He turned the pages until he came to the name : Terry , Wallace Herbert ; b . Milwaukee , Wis. , Dec. 7 , 1876 ; A.B . Wisconsin , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , here 's some of his work . And mind you , he 's written dozens of treatises , monographs , and studies on subjects like these . ' Sex determination of the domestic mouse , mus musculus . " The spermatogenesis of Calex pipiens . ' That 's just a sample . It 's all the work of a precise specialist in narrow fields . All good in its way , but shows no ability at synthesis . I 've consulted the authorities in his field , and they say he 's a good man with a microscope but has no grasp of what goes on outside his special province , no breadth of imagination , no insight . What right have I to turn loose a man like that to take charge of the education of young minds ? Somebody has to look out for the undergraduates . In the college game we all have vested interests . The regents think of re-election , of keeping the alumni quiet . The alumni think of athletics and fraternities . No one thinks of the students . If a president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest president ought to look out for the students even in another institution . " " But Henry , it 'll kill him if he does n't get the appointment . " " Just what I said . His psychological condition is bad . But anyhow , he 's one of our poorest teachers . The boys avoid his courses , not because they 're hard but because they 're dull , and I do n't really believe his relations with the faculty are happy . He 's stodgy and stubborn and intellectually muscle-bound . " " But you must . " " What do you mean I must , Mr. Da-vidson ? " " Just this . Your plan wo n't work , it wo n't go through the faculty if Terry stays . You see he 's senior dean and responsible for all appointments from the ranks of lower professors and instructors . What Terry thinks to-day the majority of the faculty will think to-morrow . " " In order to save my plan you want me to wish Terry off on Pittsburgh . " " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence here against you I feel sure the body of the faculty could be persuaded . Promote young Kennedy ; he 's alive and thoroughly behind your idea . " " I tell you Terry is n't an educator . He 's an old fossil with a Ph.D . and a wish to study the sex determination of the household mouse . He 's not a teacher , he 's not interested in young minds , he 's not interested in anything but his research . I 'd be wishing a gold brick offon Pittsburgh . Would that be a square thing to do ? " " Yes , but it 's done that way . That 's how many university appointments are made  --  to get someone out and something accomplished . " " Well , I can tell you it wo n't be done that way here . If the plan fails , it fails . Now was there something else ? " V The Dean was tail , the Dean was gaunt , the Dean was sixty and bald . Sitting on the edge of his chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , he was president , and the President was a young instructor being rebuked for negligence by his superior . Each of the two men represented what the other most disliked . The President was always skeptical of age in authority , and the Dean had little patience for young whippersnappers who were , as he confided to his wife , " too big for their boots . " What the country needed was respect for constituted authority , and when he became President of Pittsburgh he would instill this attitude into the student body . Although he knew his fate rested with the young man he distrusted , he made no attempt to compromise or change his demeanor , which was one of polite suspicion rather than of cordiality . " Mr. President . speaking ... h'inm ... off the record , I feel it a duty to tell you that there is considerable opposition to the changes you suggested last fall in the curriculum . You see the faculty here like to feel sure we know where we are going , so any such changes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their teaching . " This was so true that the Dean was silent . In university circles one just did n't talk that way . Old President Boswell with whom he had been on Sam and John terms for eighteen years would never have dared address a senior dean in such a manner . " Yes . . . in a way , perhaps . But you are asking them to give up criteria which have been part of the educational pro-gram of the university since its inception . When you suggest the abolition of cuts , probation , and all that sort of thing , it makes the older  --  and if I may say so , the wiser members of the faculty .. . " " Wonder how they 'd find standards for marking students if time-worn customs like these were abolished . " The two men were on each other 's nerves . But the Dean had better control ; he had been dealing with brash young men for many a long year . Naturally he did n't like the trend of the conversation . Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would end in disaster , and what did he get for his pains ? Rudeness . So he hesitated a minute , took off his glasses and wiped them carefully , a gesture always in order when some graduate student asked him a question in class he could n't answer . " Well , possibly there 's more to it than just that . The younger faculty members feel that their salaries are not likely to be raised for some time if your plan goes into effect and additions to the staff are required . " " In other words , they believe in the idea educationally , but they object to it for personal reasons . " " After all , Mr. President , some of those boys are trying to bring up families on eighteen hundred dollars a year . However , I merely suggest this . There 's one matter more imminent and more important . " He leaned over and almost whispered the next sentence . " The Jews . You 'll have to do something at the next regents ' meeting . What do you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is there to suggest ? " " H 'm . You must be aware that for the first time in the history of this institution our enrollment of Jewish students has passed the twenty-five per cent mark . Eastern universities have been shutting their doors to them gradually and now we are getting them out here . " " But are n't they good students ? Do n't they add something to the intellectual life of the place ? " The Dean paused . No one had ever asked that question in that way . " Ye-es . But they are trouble-makers . All our student riots are caused by this group from New York and Brooklyn . Now I 'm told at Princeton they have an excellent idea . They take in a small percentage of Jews in every freshman class , high-grade boys y'understand , so they can prove there is no racial discrimination . " " That is , they refuse admission to all Jews whose fathers are not vice-presidents of Wall Street investment trusts , is that it ? " The Dean was now shocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . This young man had no taste . Always smart and flip . How he longed for Sam Boswell who could pretend never to see the most obvious things . " Not at all . They simply have a quota and stick to it . Is n't that logical ? If such an idea were adopted at Mammoth we . . . " " Not while I 'm in charge . I dislike that method of attacking the problem . " " Very well . But if something is n't done half the student body wilI be Jewish . You recall what happened at Columbia . If we do n't take steps soon the university will have to go out of business . " " Dean Terry , it 's my opinion it would be better for the university to go out of business then . However , we 'll meet that question when it arises . " VI When the President made his annual address to incoming freshmen at the start of the year he advised them to " take a good look at me , for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was true . Henry had observed that as for any influence he might have with the undergraduates he might just as well live in the State capital . As a rule not one student in ten knew what he looked like , and the number of undergraduates who managed to run the barrage of deans , as-sistant deans , secretaries , and others on the road to his desk was small . For that reason he always read the Daily Orange , the student newspaper , with attention . On the front page that morning was a column entitled " Hear That Cry . " It read ; " Senior . ' Hear that cry ? ' " Freshman . ' Yep , what is it ? ' " Senior . ' The wolves . They 're after Coach Sanford , and Doc Maguire , the Graduate Manager too . ' " Freshman . ' What for ? ' " Senior . ' Well , they say the coaching staff is divided , half Sanford and half Maguire . They say there 's far too much divided authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Senior . ' Not so long as the President has courage . But of course that stadium over there scats eighty-six thousand and has n't been filled since the Purdue game of 1932 . If the University is going to fill it there has to be a winning team , and we have n't had a winning team since the days when Doc was head coach . The G. P. has to be considered . ' " Freshman . ' Who 's the G. P. ? ' " Senior . ' The General Public , stupid . ' " Freshman . ' Then the wolves are the General Public ? ' " Senior . ' Not exactly . The wolves are the G. P. and the alumni and the downtown quarterbacks and what they call the press . That 's because they are always pressing , see . When the entire pack gets together in full cry , all pressing together , it 's just too bad . ' " Freshman . Do you think they 'll get the Old Man ? Say , you do n't think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior . ' Well , they say the Doc built the Stadium himself . They even say he founded the University . But you ca n't tell what 'll happen when the pack starts pressing . ' " Freshman . ' Then it is n't pressing yet ? ' " Senior . ' I should say not . But it certainly will unless ? ' " Freshman . ' Unless what ? ' " Senior . ' Unless the team wins . " ' President Browne threw the paper aside . That reminded him that it was a year since he had discussed the problem of athletics with the six college presidents . In that period , Blair had replied , entirely agreeing with his suggestions . No one else had even dared put his refusal in black and white . If the others did n't want to play ball there was little he could do . On that hand he was beaten for the time being . The telephone rang , and as Miss Davis was not in the office , he picked up the receiver . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He has . . . no , of course I did n't know it . I 'll be right over . . . . " Miss Davis , talking with a senior who was attempting to get an appointment to see the President the next week , saw him rush past , hatless and coatless , without a word . She looked after him with astonishment because she knew his list of appointments was full for the next three hours . VII Professor Davidson , puffing his pipe in his study , was explaining the inside meaning of the whole thing to a former student , now editor of a small up-state newspaper . " You see , Tommy , I 'm trying merely to give you the background . No , it was n't so much his lack of tact and impatience that did it , the main thing was his hatred of Dean Terry . Terry opposed his changes in the curriculum , as did many of the faculty , although we were all for them if he had n't been in such a hurry . Consequently when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he refused to give it . That was what caused Terry 's breakdown . " " I see . Browne did n't like Terry . " " No . The two men were antagonistic , I think . Naturally when Terry committed suicide . . . " " Suicide ! They told us he slipped and fell out of a window at home . " " Oh , they always say that . The point is that many of us were enthusiastic about Browne 's idea for a university , and if it had n't been for his vindictiveness toward poor old Terry . . . " Mrs. Make , the wife of the Regis Professor of Medieval History , was explaining it this way to the wife of the Bursar . " Jim says the faculty were unanimously behind him for his two-year plan , if he 'd only used a little patience . But he says it 's terribly bad when things get to such a pass that the President pursues his enmity to the point of driving a professor to his death . " Mr. Baker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view in a letter to his friend the Governor . " We gave the man a free hand in every respect , but he tried to get things done in such an infernal hurry . The faculty at Mammoth , as you know , are jealous of any infringement of their academic freedom , and they felt rightly that the persecution of Terry was unjustifiable . There was no real conflict of principles , for we were all for his idea of making Mammoth a real educational institution . " President Fielding and President Shapleigh , in a smoking compartment on the Hiawatha , bound for St. Paul , confided their feelings to each other . " They tell me , Fielding , he used to come before the regents with some crazy idea and ask them to vote on it immediately . I always give my regents three or four months . " " Yes , he was apparently in a hurry . That 's no way to get things done . And then the faculty disliked him ; all except a few hotheads like Kennedy . And Du Bois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A first-class teacher , Du Bois , but a trouble-maker . I was quite frank when Browne said he wanted him , I warned him the man was a trouble-maker . Know what he replied ? Said he feltevery faculty should have a few troublemakers or it would grow static . Why , Shapleigh , the man 's practically a red ; he voted for Norman Thomas in the last election . " " Yes , and he 's tactless too . You know I believe it 's good for a man 's morale to be licked once in a while . Naturally I take good care my faculty do n't beat me on questions of importance . But it was n't his ideas that I objected to ; they were mostly sound . Fine thing , that two-year plan . I hope to get it over at my place one of these days . But his continual persecution of that poor dean , what was his name ? " " Terry , you mean ? " " Yes , fine man too . A scholar , Terry . Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do things without considering the whole picture . Now the largest part of my time is spent compromising . Every good administrator compromises . I play one group off against another and let each one think they 're getting their own way . " " I know , people do n't realize that 's the way to progress . I find most of my time is spent in what you might call negative rather than positive work , in defending the university from attacks and pressure from outside . That 's constructive too . A man like Browne aroused so much antagonism that the machine stalled . Too bad , his ideas were sound . " " Yes , his ideas were all first-class . But a college president , Shapleigh , has a great responsibility . First of all he must keep the machine moving . Then he must be a leader . " " By all means , Fielding , a college president has a duty to be a leader . That 's what I always say . By the way , have you heard yet whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
