" Put the wage increase through and we 'll leave , " was the gist of the response last August when a committee backed by Mexico 's President Lazaro Cardenas ordered 17 U. S. and other foreign oil companies to pay a wage increase of some $7,000,000 . <P> The proposed increase was the Mexican Government 's way of settling a strike by 18,000 Mexican oil workers which seriously threatened Mexico 's depleted Treasury , greatly dependent upon taxes paid by foreign oil interests . Oilmen , already spouting over vigorous President Cardenas ' expropriation of 850,000 acres of undeveloped oil lands leased by foreigners , objected vigorously and the wage problem was referred to a Mexican board of arbitration and conciliation . Even friendly U. S. Ambassador Josephus Daniels protested . <P> Last month President Cardenas neatly split the opposition by a deal with Mexican Eagle Oil Co. ( an affiliate of British Royal Dutch-Shell , which controls 60% of Mexican oil production ) , yielding it full control of the rich Poza Rica field in return for royalties of 15% to 35% of the petroleum produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having thus strengthened his own position and his Treasury 's prospects , President Cardenas put the next move squarely up to the 15 U. S companies . He decreed that the $7,000,000 wage increase should go into effect . While Ambassador Daniels muttered , the U. S. companies pondered whether they really would abandon their $175,000,000 Mexican investment .
