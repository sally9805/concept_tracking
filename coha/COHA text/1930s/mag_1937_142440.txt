As I WAS GOING DOWN SACKVILLE STREET-Oliver St. John Gogarty-Rey-nal &; Hitchcock ( $3.50 ) . <P> Dublin 's Dr. Gogarty may go down in history merely as the original of Malachi Mulligan in Joyce 's Ulysses , but if so he will go down fighting . Ever since the publication of James Joyce 's big book ( 1922 ) , legends of Dr. Gogarty 's near-mythical person have been stealing round the world like a slow smile . His many friends in Dublin could swear he was flesh- &-blood,; but it was not till this week that the struggle for existence between the live doctor and the fictitious medical student began to look like a fair fight . Gogarty had published in the U. S. two books of verse ( Wild Apples and Selected Poems ; TIME , Nov. 27 , 1933 ) which indicated that his Joycean counterpart was merely a portrait of the doctor as a young man ; this week he published a work long in progress that showed him an unmistakably three-dimensional figure , as live as a high-tension line , as individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sackville Street ( the line is from a bawdy ballad ) is not patterned in the ordinary , staid memoir manner . Not only by the title but by the book 's motto ( " We Irishmen are apt to think something and nothing are near neighbors " ) and the author 's note ( " The names in this book are real , the characters fictitious " ) readers are warned to hang on to their hats . <P> The Dublin through which Gogarty takes his sometimes headlong but not always straightforward course is peopled with queer , usually delightful characters , many of them transatlantically famed . Francis Hackett , George Moore , AE , William Butler Yeats , many a lesser fish swim through the bright underwater of Gogarty 's world , and few of them are not good for a laugh , for Gogarty is never reverent even where he admires . Queerest fish of the lot is one " Endymion , " who regularly steers his course home by compass , was once arrested for sabering a ham ( which he had previously bought ) running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Dr. Gogarty is a distinguished throat specialist who works in an up-to-date hospital ( built from profits from the Irish Sweepstakes ) , a married man and a father ; but readers would hardly guess those facts from his book . Here he steers a carefree bachelor course from pubs to parties , escaping occasionally to drive his plane or shoot seals from a curragh , but always returning to drink with his friends , to be talked at and talk a sizzling blue streak . Only when the talk hovers on politics or poetry does the twinkle leave Gogarty 's eye . " But nobody can betray Ireland : it does not give him the chance ; it betrays him first . " An ex-senator of the Irish Free State , he has no love for the Republicans , not one good word for de Valera : " De Valera and degeneration are synonymous . " As an outspoken enemy of the Irish Republican Army during the Civil War ( 1922-23 ) , he was shot at , kidnapped , had his country house burned down .
