Morris Sheppard of Texas , the gentle , whitehaired father of the late Prohibition experiment and diligent overseer of Senatorial campaign morality , last week went to the White House in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs . News that President Roosevelt had secretly aided France in purchasing U. S. airplanes , revealed accidentally by the crash of a new Douglas bomber in California ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) , had upset and excited Military Affairs. * In the White House , President Roosevelt began to lecture Chairman Sheppard on his reasons for helping France , using background facts and confidential reports so arresting that Chairman Sheppard presently told the President he really thought the whole Military Affairs Committee should hear this lecture . Mr. Roosevelt agreed , and presently the committee , 17 strong , were closeted with the U. S. Commander in Chief at the White House . <P> When the Senators emerged after more than an hour , the Isolationists among them - North Dakota 's Nye , Missouri 's Clark , North Carolina 's Reynolds-were fuming . The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Senator Nye , " when there is so much that ought to be said , is something more than distressing . " <P> Secrecy , Franklin Roosevelt well knows , lasts about five minutes in Washington-particularly if 17 Senators are involved . Newspapers the world over soon headlined that Franklin Roosevelt had placed the U. S. " frontier " or " first line of defense " in France . As Chief Executive he had laid down for the Senators a foreign policy aligning the U. S. more strongly than ever behind France and England . As Commander in Chief he had declared his determination to back those democracies for defensive war by every means short of actual manpower . <P> Basic question the U. S. press immediately asked was : had this Democratic President made any commitments comparable to the moral ones assumed by the last Democratic President with regard to " foreign entanglements " ? To his full height in the Senate rose young Henry Cabot Lodge , grandson and namesake of one of the men who drove Woodrow Wilson wild on the League of Nations issue , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $2,000,000,000 Stabilization Fund , to see if any financial commitments were implied by the President 's program . Senator Lodge 's move was followed by a declaration from Senator Gerald ( " Neutrality " ) Nye , who announced : " I ... give notice of withdrawal from all executive secret committee meetings of the Military Affairs Committee . . . until such time as ... the record , devoid of any military secrets . . . shall be available to the people . " <P> Worse for Franklin Roosevelt than even the headlines in U. S. newspapers about his " new " foreign commitments was a speech in Chicago by the G.O . P. 's one living ex-President , Herbert Hoover . Said he : " . . . We are deluged with talk of war . . . . Amid these agitations President Roosevelt has now announced a new departure in foreign policies . . . . Our foreign policies in these major dimensions must be determined by the American people and the Congress , not by the President alone . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
