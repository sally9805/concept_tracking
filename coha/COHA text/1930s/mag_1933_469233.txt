THERE are some twelve million peace seekers in this country who are active to the extent of participating in organized effort to end war . More than a million dollars is spent every year in political and educational propaganda . With those numbers and that money great things should be accomplished ; but in point of fact the results have been woefully small . The peace seekers have not been able to make the United States a world leader against war ; they have not been able in twelve years of trying to get America into the World Court . They wanted this country to join with other nations in barring the use of poison gas , but they were defeated in that effort by the American Legion which has a membership of less than a million and spends only twenty-five thousand dollars a year on its lobby . The chief reason for the ineffectiveness of the peace movement is its lack of unity . Its weakness is precisely the same as that of the League of Nations . The League is split into fifty-five separate entities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace movement in the United States is split into some sixty separate societies , each as recalcitrant as any sovereign nation in the matter of sub- . merging its identity to make common cause . Quite unconsciously the pacifists exemplify the very human frailty they are trying to combat : They chide the nations for not living as one big happy family , while they themselvesexist in a state of perpetual internecine feud . Naturally , there is a difference of opinion on how to go about abolishing war ; that is only to be expected . With reasonable tolerance , however , the peace groups might be expected to join in furthering measures on which they could agree . Such co-operation would be invaluable in building public opinion and directing its force . The lack of that co-operation seriously cripples the peace movement by diminishing its power of leadership and its ability to get things accomplished . The incompatibility of the peace seekers was never more painfully apparent than at the present time when united action would be so eminently desirable . The peace groups realized the need of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of the World Disarmament Conference at Geneva , they formed an Interorganization Council with the intention of joining forces to assume the leadership they knew they should assume . When this article was being written , the Disarmament Conference was still holding together and struggling along bravely . But the Inter-organization Council of American peace groups had all but given up the ghost , practically dissolved in its own dissensions . H The story of this most ambitious effort to achieve peace among the peace seekers can be understood only by first obtaining a picture of the chaos which prevailed previously in pacifist circles  - -  and , alas , still prevails . So numerous are the organizations interested in abolishing war that their titles alone are confusing . There are 9 Associations of divers descriptions , 8 serious-minded Committees , 7 Unions , 5 Leagues , 4 Societies , 4 Councils , 3 Institutes , and a miscellaneous assortment of Movements , Alliances , Fellowships , Federations , and Foundations . It is doubtful whether even a peace expert could keep all his confreres straight . There is that rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banquets to visiting diplomats ; directors all in Who 's Who , average age seventy years ; budget , $687,846 ; oppressively respectable . The most zealous militarist has no fear of the work of the Carnegie Endowment . And , on the other hand , there is that comparative ragamuffin , the Committee on Militarism in Education which consists , for working purposes , of two young men in a dilapidated back room furnished with chairs that must be sat on carefully lest they fall apart ; budget , $8,000 , and they 're lucky if they get it ; luncheons , if any , fifty cent ones , Dutch treat . Yet all over the country the military propagandists are constantly harassed by this Committee and unquestionably would like to put a bounty on the heads of the two young men . The Carnegie Endowment and the Committee on Militarism could hardly be said to be on speaking terms . Consider two sister organizations that preserve the amenities but have very little in common . The Committee on the Cause and Cure of War is as impressive in numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's organizations assemble once a year to ponder the problems of peace . A worthy conclave , but hardly agile either in thought or deed . On the other hand , the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom ( Jane Addams , President ) is busy all year round . Timidity is not in it ; complete and total disarmament is its demand . When its attractive young lobbyist , Miss Dorothy Detzer , appears at a Congressional hearing the big navyites wince . The World Alliance for International Friendship Through the Churches displays on its letterhead an array of notable names ( Dr. S. Parkes Cadman , etc. ) , and while its activities are not confined solely to displaying these names , it moves for peace as though tiptoeing over a carpet of eggs . Obviously , it can have virtually no contact with the Fellowship of Reconciliation . Equally religious in motivation , equally world-wide in scope , the Fellowship would do away with the whole capitalistic system , if necessary , to achieve peace . It would send its members to jail rather than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifist forces , bane of the militarists ? and of its more orthodox brethren . Side by side in Washington are the League for independent Political Action and the National Council for Prevention of War , both peace seekers . The League , sensing the war possibilities in imperialism , snaps at the Government for maintaining marines in Haiti and Nicaragua . The National Council closes its eyes to Uncle Sam 's peccadillos of this sort . It is an important coalition of peace forces , does effective lobbying and propaganda work , but it is cautious about raising any questions that might embarrass the political powers-that-be . Between the League and the National Council there is scant co-operation . Then there is the dear old American Peace Society , which recently celebrated its one hundredth anniversary , veteran of them all . It dates back to the days when American pacifists opposed war on the ground that soldiers were continually violating the Sabbath , what with their swearing and fighting . The A.P.S. is the favorite peace organization of the D.A.R. , the American Legion , the Army and Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for America to be pacific is to let none outdo us in armaments ; it boasts of having rooted for every war this country has fought . How could the American Peace Society possibly allow itself to be tainted by association with , say , those reds the War Resisters ? The War Resisters ( who count Einstein a member ) believe that the way to end war is for nobody to fight , and they have signed up many converts in America and Europe . At a meeting of the League of Neighbors ( a religious pacifist group ) , you hum in unison ( " Ooom-000mm " ) for a few minutes before embarking into Indian philosophy with your fellow-swamis in order to start a wave of brotherliness undulating around the world . Naturally , there is an unbridgeable gulf between this group and the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America . The Federal Council means business ; militarists fear it . Obviously , then , it was a bold move in the spring of 1931 to bring the leaders of the various peace societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. united pacifist front for the World Disarmament Conference . Highly desirable , of course , but the obstacles to harmony must have seemed mountainous . Obstacle No. 1 was the doctrinal differences . Some peace seekers were staunchly conservative politically ; others at the extreme left felt that socialism was the only sure road toworld amity . Some favored inching along to peace ; others wanted to crash the gates and have the United States lead the way if necessary by abolishing its army and navy . Some would support a League of Nations war to punish a malefactor ; others would neither support nor fight in any war at all . Obstacle No . Q lay in the fact that pacifists are incurable particularists . The Women 's Peace Union is interested almost exclusively in the various antiwar measures presented to Congress by Senator Lynn J. Frazier . The Peace Heroes ' Memorial Society feels that the answer to the whole problem is to build statues to pacifists instead of to warriors . One society is preoccupied with chasing the R.O.T.C. out of the schools , another with getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Foundation is devoted to the World Court , and the World Peace Foundation is bent on broadcasting the proper sort of literature . The various groups are not always convinced of the importance of ? are , in fact , cool toward ? the aims of the various other groups . Obstacle No. 3 devolved round the seldom mentioned point that all the peace societies except the few endowed ones are , in a sense , financial rivals . Wealthy patrons are limited ; there is only so much money to go around ; what one peace society gets in the way of contributions the next peace society loses . Director X of the X ' Peace Society dropped into the office of Director Y of the Y ' Peace Society one day for a friendly chat about peace matters . Director Y interrupted the conversation to telephone to a prospective contributor for an appointment , and got it for three o'clock . Whereupon Director X excused himself , hurried out to a pay telephone and got an appointment with the same prospective contributor for two-thirty . Director Y , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend Director X emerging with three hundred dollars and a satisfied look . The unlucky Director Y got nothing for his society that day . This is an actual incident . Despite these formidable obstacles to harmony , a Coalition of pacifist leaders was duly formed for co-operation on the problems of the World Disarmament Conference . The Carnegie Endowment would have nothing to do with it , thank you , and some of the smaller societies were either too busy with their own affairs or too remote from New York to make participation practical . But nearly all the important groups joined in , to the total number , in the beginning , of forty different peace societies . Now when forty peace societies get together trouble is imminent , and right away trouble began to brew , and it brewed and brewed . If there remains any breath of life-in the Council by next month its troubles will have been brewing exactly two years . What may be called the Battle of Aims broke out immediately . The conferees had before them a proposed list of eight possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ' ? tre , and the first duty was to decide by discussion and ballot which goals to set . The eight functions embodied in essence two conflicting points of view . The conservative peace groups wanted the Coalition to be merely a study conference to talk things over but not to do much , especially not to issue statements setting forth collective views . Some of their leaders felt that the safe way to hold a job was to give the appearance of great activity without committing one 's self to any proposition which might later draw a frown from so much as one august higher-up . The directors of the liberal groups , on the other hand , felt that they were too busy to indulge inhi-monthly talk-fests unless the Coalition would actually do something ; and their idea of useful activity was to bring pacifist views into focus and through " united front " manifestoes assume leadership in peace affairs . Temporarily the victory fell to the do-nothing conservatives . The Coalition was innocuously christened " Study Conference on Disarmament , " and the issuing of statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , by no means ended hostilities . Within two months the liberal groups became restive at what they regarded as paralyzing inaction and decided to hold conclave among themselves . So they formed the habit of gathering for a preliminary meeting of their own an hour or so in advance of each meeting of the entire Coalition . They called themselves the Emergency Peace Committee , and they plotted ways to spur the larger group to more definite achievements . Thus the " Study Conference on Disarmament " became not one but two conferences although there was no overt split . The next development was a shrewd move on the part of the liberals . They persuaded the Coalition that " Study Conference on Disarmament " was a dull name ; a new one should be chosen and a letterhead printed listing the participating peace organizations . This innocent-appearing coup succeeded , and the Coalition blossomed forth as the Interorganization Council on Disarmament , which it remained . The liberals ' reasoning was this : under the new name the issuing of statements would not be inconsistent , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a batch of attractive stationery was printed , the temptation to use it would be almost irresistible . The reasoning was correct . The Battle of Aims was destined to flare up at intervals thenceforward in the midst of other engagements . bassador from Japan debated , defeated . New resolution finally passed urging President to recommend embargo on arms and loans . Here the Battle of Aims broke out again , temporarily overshadowing the Battle of Manchuria which had already thrust into the background the Battle of Disarmament . In connection with the new resolution about the Far Eastern situation , the newspapers had played up the name of the Federal Council of the Churches as being one of the sponsors . This was an unpleasant surprise to the Federal Council because its representatives had left the Interorganization session just before the resolution had been passed . The Federal Council became exceedingly wroth and telegraphed a disavowal to Secretary Stimson . The newspapers , seizing gleefully upon an internal squabble among the peace organizations , gave this incident much more publicity than they had given the original resolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World Alliance for International Friendship Through the Churches resigned in a sympathetic huff . The conservative groups delivered an ultimatum that the issuing of statements in the Council 's name must stop ; and the liberal groups replied with a threat to bolt and retire permanently to their Emergency Peace Committee , breaking up the Council altogether . After a period of tension , a compromise was arranged . Statements would be issued thenceforward only if approved by a practically unanimous vote of the Council , and if not unanimous , the one or two dissenting organizations could have their names blocked out of the letterhead , temporarily . If ? and this was the quid pro quo to mollify the liberals ? any ten organizations wanted to issue a statement on their own account , theycould have the facilities of the Council secretariat to do so , providing they used plain paper with no letterhead . This was advantageous to the Emergency Peace Committee because it had no secretary . So the Battle of Aims subsided for the time being ? and the Battle of Manchuria was resumed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ el : " The Manchurian situation grows steadily worse . Therefore I hope that everyone will make a special effort to be present . " December 21 ? Motion to promote a private boycott of Japanese goods rejected . Motion to appoint a committee of three to study the advisability of a private boycott carried . December 29 ? Committee to study private boycott had not met , because two of its members bitterly opposed to boycott in any form . Voted unanimously to appoint committee of three to see Japanese ambassador and tell him how perturbed peace groups were . ( Japanese troops went right on marching to Chinchow , last remaining point of conquest in Manchuria . ) January 11 , 1982 ? Committee to study private boycott still had not been able to get together . January 25 ? No meeting as yet of committee to study private boycott . ( Japan , having gobbled up Manchuria , was now threatening China proper . ) Council rejected motion to urge withdrawal of our ambassador if Japanese invaded Shanghai . February 8 ? ( four months after the outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a policy : United States should declare embargo on arms and loans and cooperate with the League ; Stimson 's note of a month previous refusing recognition of violent territorial acquisitions endorsed . Voted to seek widest publicity for this united program . February 26 ? Long discussion of activities of others ( including such radicals as A. Lawrence Lowell and Newton D. Baker ) in advocating use of international boycott to prevent breaches of the peace . April 1 ? Debated proposed resolution that teeth in the form of economic sanctions be put in Kellogg Pact . ( Flirting with the boycott idea under a new name . ) April 14 ? Large majority in favor of passing resolution approving use of economic sanctions . Then someone pointed out that a bill to that effect had already been introduced in Congress . Should the Council pass its own resolution , or vote to support the bill in Congress ? The Council could not agree . ( By this time the Sino-Japanese imbroglio had almost disappeared from the newspapers on account of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even before the Battle of Manchuria had faded out , the Council 's final fight had got underway . The Battle of Chicago was destined to be the fiercest , the most devastating of all . It had started innocently enough on the first day of April when the Council was told about a project launched by some women peace advocates to hold a parade in Chicago at the time of the political conventions and submit to them " one general declaration .. . which shall have the approval of all peace organizations . " The essence of the idea was again the presentation of a united front . The women , little suspecting what a whirlwind they were to reap , invited the Interorganization Council to take part . It did so , with gusto . In fact , the Council seized the project , tossed it about and eventually tore it to bits . The bone of contention was , of course , the " peace plank " upon which the various organizations should unite for presentation to the conventions . The conservative groups drew one up , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago . Armaments should be reduced , international co-operation should be increased . The intention was to be eminently practical , to present not a pacifist manifesto but a ready-made plank for Republicans and Democrats to insert into their platforms verbatim . Several meetings of the Council discussed the plank in minute detail , and finally the time arrived to vote on it as a whole . At this point , up spoke the left-wing groups . The plank , they said , was not as realistic as the conservatives thought . It was so timid that it lagged behind the views of liberal Senators on the party resolutions committees . The liberal Senators would thus be left out on the end of a limb : their reactionary colleagues would taunt them with the fact that even the pacifists would not support their advanced views . The net effect of the plank would be to hinder rather than help the progress of peace . Moreover , the conservatives ' plank utterly ignored some of the most immediate obstacles to world amity , such as war debts , tariffs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plank just would n't do . The Council voted to ponder it further . The left-wing groups promptly drew up a rival declaration , calling for drastic reduction of armaments and in addition demanding downward revision of war debts , recognition of Russia , and the lowering of tariff walls . By May ninth , after a month of controversy , it became apparent that the council was deadlocked , the right-wing determined upon their innocuous plank , the left-wing adamant for their bold one . In this crisis an ingenious compromise was arranged . The Council voted to combine the two planks into one manifesto with twelve sections . Each constituent organization would thereupon decide for itself which of the sections it was willing to support . Then the delegation would go to Chicago and say , in effect , to the political parties , " Here are the demands of the peace advocates . Sections 1 , 2 and 3 are supported by all of the peace organizations ; sections 4 , 5 and 6 are supported by the following organizations . . . " and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various organizations with the request to return their decisions on the sections . The sky seemed as bright as could be expected . At least the outward form of unity would be preserved in that there would be a single delegation appearing before the Chicago conventions representing all the pacifists . But the conservative groups brooded , and the more they brooded the more miffed they became . The liberals had spoiled their plank . So they borrowed the tactics of their left-wing adversaries and summoned a rump meeting of their own . There they rebelled against the Council 's compromise to which they themselves had agreed , and resolved to sabotage the plan . Their organizations would refuse to record their support of any of the sections of the joint plank . And they would send their own spokesman to Chicago to present the mild plank they originally drew up . The left-wing , in short , could go hang . All semblance of peace in the Inter-organization Council vanished , and open warfare broke out between the two groups of organizations bent on leading America into pacific ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the left-wing group and the right-wing waged intense competitive campaigns for signers to their rival peace planks . The united front was forgotten in the scramble . And when the conventions assembled , the political parties heard the pacifist plea not from one but from two separate ? quite separate ? delegations . Fred B. Smith , of the World Alliance for international Friendship Through the Churches , presented the right-wing plank ; and Miss Jane Ad-dams , of the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom , presented the left-wing manifesto . That was the end , for all practical purposes , of the Interorganization Council . The left-wing groups attended no more meetings , other groups lost interest . The forty participating organizations dwindled to a mere dozen , and the few sessions since have been listless affairs . At last reports , the Council was in a state of suspended animation . The importance of the campaign to banish international warfare can scarcely be overestimated ; the very existence of civilization may depend upon its success . It is doubtful whether any military campaign in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the peace crusaders march forth against militarism not as an organized army , but as an agglomeration of regiments quite independent , even jealous , of one another . Pacifist forces can no more take their objectives in that fashion than could troops on a war front . Individually , pacifist regiments are valiant , and both groups into which they are roughly divided are valuable . The conservatives , keeping their feet on the ground , win the allegiance of cautious citizens who might be frightened out of the peace movement by the often quixotic liberals . The liberals , on the other hand , are furthering progress by constantly blazing new trails ; their radical proposals of 1920 having become familiar and , therefore , respectable and , therefore , conservative by 1930 , the liberals go on to still more radical proposals which will appear safe and sane in 1940 . The trouble is that these regiments , with all their colonels , are robbed of their strength for want of a general . A general would discipline them to a tolerance that would end quibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . At present several peace societies are likely to issue pamphlets on the same subject covering the same ground . Finally , a pacifist general would lead in the formation of a plan of strategy , now sadly lacking . Were the peace forces with their tremendous latent strength to agree upon a series of specific objectives and concentrate their efforts , they would advance from triumph to triumph . Much time and energy is now spent persuading the people at large of the desirability of world peace and the horror of war . This is sheer waste . The people are already convinced . What they want to know is how to go about abolishing war . But when the peace leaders fall out among themselves over questions of method , the common man is thrown into bewilderment , whereupon be is inclined to discount all pacifist talk and listen more receptively to the military voice that speaks with comforting coherence . Once the pacifists unite , the consequent increase of power and public support may surprise even themselves .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
