txt  | in this form of decoration as those of the French Court . The illustrations are taken from English sources and show only a small amount . If more decoration is desired the edges of any of the houppelandes illustrated could be cut as preferred . The " dandies " of the time were not far behind the French , if at all , in their dress , but the appearance of the generality of the English nobility was usually on the saner side , though in splendour of colour and material and magnificence of equipment and jewels the English were unmatched . The French fashions show an inventiveness in detail which almost amounts to eccentricity . Parti-colour was still fashionable for hose and sleeves and sometimes the whole houppelande was divided as to colour . Linings , when not of fur , contrasted in colour with the main material . While the younger men cut their garments shorter and ever shorter , to the grave scandal of the moralists , the older men retained the longer houppelande cut to about cover the instep , while those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium length coming to just below the knee . A useful garment was a circular cloak in which two long slashes were cut from shoulder to hem , leaving a wide panel in front ; this  | panel was fastened round the waist with a belt . It had a turn-back collar and was worn over a tunic with low collar and tight-fitting sleeves . It was lined with fur or some contrasting colour . With all these garments , hose , sometimes parti-coloured , were worn and very often there appear to be no actual shoes . One imagines that light soles were attached to the cloth hose . Clogs or poulains were worn for walking outdoors , but were discarded indoors . The shape of the toes of the hose , when no shoes were worn , follows the prevalent mode and is more or less pointed as the fashion of the moment dictated . During the early part of the century hoods were worn in the individual way that came in in the previous century . The cape part was now very generally dagged , which lent itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the part that normally surrounded the face into a kind of circular sausage . The serrated cape was thus left standing up or rather falling to one side and the long tail or liripipe hung down over the shoulders . This method of wearing the hood at last ousted all others , and instead of troubling to fix it afresh every time it was put on , it was customary to have it made up " ready to wear . " A long  | stuffed roll surrounded the head , a kind of dagged flounce stood up in the middle , and a long tail or scarf was attached at one side . The individually rolled hood lasted longer in England than on the Continent . It took some time to break down the prejudice against the " sham " of the chaperon on French lines . Probably it was at first looked on as a man of the present day regards a made up tie or a dickey . The middle-class people of the richer civilian and merchant classes wore long gowns of less exaggerated cut than that favoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gown with square-cut sleeves and cowled neck was more usual . For travelling the semicircular cloak , fastened with a clasp or three buttons on the shoulder was often used . Hoods were generally worn by merchants and artizans and a hat was often placed over the hood , especially by travellers . These hats were of various shapes , that having a highish crown and a brim cut in various forms so as to allow of its being turned up in different ways , being the most usual . A flatter wideawake shape also occurs . The labourers in the fields and those belonging to the various trades , builders , carpenters , and so on , continued to wear the traditional belted  | tunic , which was now , however , sometimes cut so as not to require pulling up over the belt ? being simply girt in so that the belt , which is fairly broad , is seen . Its buckle and pouch and often a general utility knife form noticeable features of the working man 's costume . Hoods are still the general head-covering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for rough work simple leggings of coarse material or leather , strapped or hound round the calves of the legs . Ankle-high shoes ? a little pointed ? are very general ; and a simple kind of protection against cold was a straight piece of material about twenty-five inches wide with a hole in the middle to put the head through , which was belted at the waist . WOMEN Women still continued to wear dresses which were very much the same as those of the previous century . A close ( not tight ) fitting gown was almost universal . It was now usually belted on the hips and often buttoned down the front and on the arm from above the elbow to the wrist ; over it was worn in most cases an overdress . For great ladies on great occasions the furred , sideless gown was most usual . This over- robe now took what was practically the standardised shape for state occasions for two hundred years or more . It was very much cut away between the shoulders and hips , and very decolletee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increasingly often as time went on , the front of the upper part was mainly or wholly composed of fur , the lower part made of silk being added just below the hip line where it begins in a series of large radiating folds . The back was broader than the front and hung almost like a cloak ? all very heavy but most dignified and impressive . This garment takes much skill in the cutting and fitting of the shoulders so as to give the necessary sweep to the back . Some people , even writers on the subject of costume , have been misled by the appearance of brasses and such records , into thinking that this upper part of the garment was a short fur-trimmed jacket with sleeves . This error has occurred owing to the under-robe , which appears in the very open space at the sides , not being recognised as part of a separate dress . The belt of the under-robe was a very special feature and played its part in the smooth adjustment of the folds to the figure , though it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses at the feet which really accomplished the perfect hang of these dresses and gave the characteristic backward swing to the shoulders and forward thrust of the lower part of the body . The actual figure seemed " slim like a weasel " in contrast . An over-dress very closely resembling the male houppelande in most points was also very generally worn . It was very long and had hanging sleeves . Some of the earliest examples ( which may also be found at the end of the fourteenth century ) have the high collar which was such a feature of the earlier male houppelande . Most of them in the fifteenth century have the low turned-back , fur-lined collar which gets still lower as time goes on . The head-dresses , however , were the marvel of the fifteenth century costume . To understand them we must bear in mind always the two plaits , one each side of the face ? not down the back ? that are the real basis of their design . Otherwise the excrescences become mere bulges instead of having a meaning . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used or even only empty cases , but they do represent those two essential plaits enclosed in a net . The phase of the goffered veil passed away suddenly and the looped and coiled plaits were  |p6o  enormously developed sideways . They were covered with a net of large mesh and very soon under the net a covering of silk over the hair appears . Then it is only a step to a box-like structure edged with gold cord which covers the ears ; over this a veil is placed , sometimes surmounted by a padded roll or coronet , bent to fit the contour of the head-dressing . In extreme cases the veil is extended on each side over horn-like supports . In the best known example of these , that at Arundel , the edge of the veil is slightly goffered . If these head-dresses are understandingly made they are quite becoming . One must bear in mind that in the transition to the stone or brass in which many of our records are made , something of the unyielding character of those substances appears . Tiny though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more sympathetic version . These headdresses are suitable between 1410 and 1430 . In 1430 the shape of the head-dress was as shown in Figure 49 and that head-dress continued in vogue , with slight alteration , until about the middle of the century . The change in fashion tended towards making the pads more upright but though such arrangements as shown in Figure 47 appear , they are rather exceptional .  | The head-dresses with large bombe pads at the sides with a veil slightly goffered at the edge draping the top of the head , passing behind the pads and falling down to the shoulders , are especially becoming . The net enclosing the hair ( or padding ) is a conspicuous feature in these head-dresses ; in fact they are generally known as reticulated head-dresses . The actual gowns worn with them differed little during the whole period . The wives of less distinguished people more or less remote from Court influence wore simpler and shorter gowns of the cote-hardie type , with or without the houppelande gown . They were not , however , supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt , however , they did when they could afford it . They seem generally to have worn white veils over plaited and coifed hair , which was arranged so as to follow at a distance the vogue of the ornate head-dress of the titled ladies . Working-class women wore a long gored gown which was often turned up to show the shorter under-dress . An apron was used to protect the front of the dress when at work . Craftsmen were well off in the towns , and their wives were well-dressed , but do not seem  | to have copied the fashions of the richer people . Any attempt to do so would have been considered improper and ridiculous . They wore hoods covering the hair , which appears to have been simply plaited and wound round flatly on the head . In general the dress of the less well to do was much the same as that of the previous period . That of country women seems to have not changed at all .  | 1450-1500 MEN DURING this half-century there is a constant change so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume at the beginning , the dress of doublet and hose , of steeple-crowned hat and hood , of hanging sleeves and pointed shoes to the open-fronted gown , the doublet and shirt , the flat hat and round-toed shoes which presently develop into the well-known dress of Henry the Eighth . It is impossible , except in a history of costumes , to follow the variations by which the one passed into the other . The first phase may be considered to terminate about 1470 or thereabouts . The most noticeable difference from the earlier part of the century will be found in the sleeves both of the tunic and of the under-garment . They are very large and long in the outer tunic , so long in fact that the hand is seldom put through the opening at the bottom of the sleeve but 64  | has another opening cut for it half way up the arm , through which it is practically always passed . The tunic is full and over it a belt is worn . It sets in pleats which start above the waist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a border round the bottom of the tunic , the edges of the arm-slit and cuffs , and round the neck or collar if there is one . The under collar , when it shows is not edged with fur . If the long sleeves were worn on the arm with the hand put through the cuff , they were pushed up to the shoulders , which made them look very broad . It was for a time fashionable to heighten and broaden the shoulder by large pads , but this soon went out of date . It was never as prominent a feature here as it was in France . The sleeves of the tunic are narrow . Another type of gown was very short and wide , having many folds and no belt . It had sleeves varying in shape but always large and wide , sometimes they were put into a rather open cuff otherwise they were simply edged with fur . In any case they gave a broad appearance to the figure . Long gowns were still worn by nobles on formal occasions and by elderly men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be laced together for a short way down , showing the low cut doublet beneath . Long hose were the universal leg coverings ,  | they were made of fine cloth cut on the cross and both legs were the same in colour , the fashion of varied colours having gone out of fashion . The shoes were the kind which we all associate with the term " jester 's shoes " ? they are brought high over the instep and at the back in points and have very long pointed toes . A less usual shape is cut straight round just above the ankle-bone . Such shoes generally lace at the inner side of the ankle . It was considered very smart to have the points of the shoes as long as possible and very eminent people might have them a foot or more in length , but four or five inches was more usual . Long soft leather boots were worn even indoors on informal occasions . The hood as a fashionable head covering had disappeared soon after 1450 and the chaperon was only used as a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the almost universal hcad-wear ; the crown was , however , fairly round on the top . They were much altered as to their appearance by the different twists and shapings of the brim which was sometimes cut away altogether , sometimes rolled up into a kind of sausage , sometimes cut into a kind of castellated form . The most usual type perhaps , about 1.170 , being the simple roll . Sometimes a scarf , which was the last vestige of the chaperon , was  | attached to the side of the crown and fell over the shoulder . A feather and a brooch was the usual trimming if there was any , but the majority of hats are plain . A hat of shallower shape , which turned up well at the back and sides so that the front formed a pointed kind of peak , was also worn . As it will be seen , there was plenty of variety in the head coverings , but it was distinctly a hat period . Merchants and richer citizens generally , did not adopt for ordinary wear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that on occasions they , or perhaps mainly the younger of them , did attire themselves in similar fashion to general court wear for feasts and so on . As a rule , however , the long cassock-like fur-lined gown with a hood and hat for travelling was the usual attire . Under the heavy gown , which was often discarded in hot weather was a full tunic fastened round the waist with a belt . A semi-circular cloak fastening on the right shoulder was sometimes worn , or a kind of coat , with a cape instead of sleeves , was used as an overcoat in cold weather . " I'he use of tall boots for riding was universal , the toes were not as long as those of shoes but were pointed .  | For those doing active outdoor work , such as farm labourers , the tunic reaching to midthigh with wide sleeves , worn over a thinner under-garment in cold weather , for those who could afford it , and as a single garment by the very poor and in warm weather , was the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the head or thrown back as the case might be . The hose of the less well-to-do were made separately for each leg . They were sometimes rather like thigh boots and could be undone from the top , in which case , being of fairly soft material , they fell down over the knee . Others wore hose of woven stuff , and leather boots of medium length over them , or simply pieces of material wound round the leg and tied at knee and ankle over the boots , as the agricultural labourer does to-day in wet weather . The farmers wore much the same kind of garments , probably the chief difference was that they were cleaner and in better repair , and they often wore a hat as well as a hood . Many land workers wore thick gloves . Townspeople were dressed in somewhat similar fashion but the doublet and hose were of a neater type when it could be afforded . Beggars wore the cast off hose and parti-coloured garments of the better-off people of an earlier day .  | Somewhere about 148o there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , worn by fashionable men . By about 1485 we find that the top garments are no longer gowns , they have become coats opening down the front . They may be cut short at mid-thigh or just above the knee or are long down to the instep . There are also short heavilyfurred gowns which have turn-back collars and full bagpipe sleeves which also open in front like a coat . Beneath them is the jerkin with knee length ( or a little shorter ) bases or skirts . The jerkin is cut down in front and shows a low-cut shirt . A narrow belt , often of stuff , from which a pouch hangs , is worn with the long open gowns . On the legs are cloth hose and the shoes are broad-toed . The jerkin is sometimes worn without a gown and is often slashed and otherwise elaborated on the sleeves . There are long fur-lined coats with turn-back fur collars which also open down the front for the great nobles and the older men . The almost universal headgear of the nobility is the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merchants and the commonalty was as a rule much the same as it had been earlier in the century .  | The sideless gown richly trimmed with fur was the correct thing for state and very formal occasions . There was also a fitting dress that appears to have borrowed the fur collar from the houppelande while otherwise retaining the lines of the close under-gown . It fits very neatly to the waist without buttons and may possibly have been laced down the back to obtain the desired effect of full bust and hips , at any rate some form of corset or underbodice must have been worn . The collar lies just over the shoulders , taking almost the line of a Victorian low-necked dress . The cuffs generally are bell-shaped but most usually are turned back to show the fur lining . At the same time the more heavy looking houppelande was also worn in different forms , sometimes with the full bagpipe sleeve and sometimes having wide open sleeves which show a fur lining ; the neck is generally cut down and turned back so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the under-gown is sometimes visible as a tiny vest . Again , as in the earlier part of the century , we have very striking head-dresses . Those that  | came into vogue about 1450 are not so attractive as their predecessors of a few years before , especially those with short veils stopping just below the nape of the neck and those that have no veil left hanging at all . They have the nets at the sides brought up above the head and surmounted by a heart-shaped roll which is bent so that it edges the padded hair at the sides and top , and goes down to the nape at the back . The origin of this roll is probably the veil twisted or rolled up , but it no doubt soon became an artificial circlet as the chaperon had done , though traces of its origin remain in the oblique twist of the ornament of strings of pearls and ribbons . Sometimes , though rarely in England , this form of head-dress was actually provided with a crest and scarf like a man 's headgear . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre . Somewhere about 1470 the butterfly headdress seems to have emerged full-blown , imported from Flanders probably , as it was in the East and South of England that it flourished most . In this head-dress the hair cases were pushed over well to the back of the head , sometimes , but not always , fused together to a " jam-pot " shape and used as a support for an enormous very transparent veil folded in any fashion t hat seemed best to the wearer , as long as it  | was spread out widely at the sides and was sharply divided by a central fold into two wings . Often there were two veils , which added to the intricacy of the arrangement . One of them was often narrow and about two feet long . When this was disposed over the forehead and eyes it had a charming effect . The real appearance of these veils must be judged from their effect when worn ; no counterfeit presentment can do them justice . Many of the brasses which portray this head-dress are unfortunately badly executed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way extremely beautiful . The ornamentation on the hair cases almost always is based on the square meshes associated with a net , but sometimes the origin is so sophisticated as to be nearly unrecognisable . The question of the tall steeple head-dress known as the hennin raises a difficult question . Nearly all the illustrations in this book are from English sources and I have failed to find an unquestionably English steeple . Having seen it portrayed in different books which purported to show the manners and customs of the English I started to track down the source of the illustrations of this head-dress and found them , in every case that I discovered , to be foreign . However , it is so wonderfully  | decorative that with this warning I shall give an illustration of it on page 26o . The heart-shaped head-dress was worn throughout the period as well as the butterfly , probably chiefly by old-fashioned people away from Court influence . It should be noted that women 's hair was kept strictly out of sight . Even when the head-dress started on the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forehead were plucked or shaved , only a small patch on the temple being visible . Brides sometimes had their hair flowing loose over their shoulders , or confined by a chaplet of jewels or flowers . Queens are also portrayed with uncovered hair . The wives of rich merchants and citizens often wore much the same fashions as the nobility though in a slightly restrained version . The very ornate head-dresses were not worn , but various versions of the side pads and heartshaped head-dress were adopted , the traditional veil remaining to some extent customary . In deciding on the dress of such a woman it would have to be considered whether she lived in London or in a remote part of the country , the Wealth and position of her husband and her age ? an old woman used to a plain hood and gown from her youth would hesitate to adopt  | a new fashion which might appear to her foolish if not altogether indecorous . The same applies to untitled country gentry . Those who went up to London and could afford it , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their manors with simple clothes fifty years behind the times . In dressing a pageant or play it is just as well to observe the sumptuary laws , as it marks the differences which add so much interest to the scenes . Of course , it is very improbable that anyone really took much notice of them at the time , except perhaps that people who had hitherto been used to less show than the ordinances now specified , hastened to display , to the last bit of fur and ell of cloth , all the finery to which their position entitled them . The manual workers wore a dress which superficially resembled that of their forbears . In reality it was cut differently . The sleeves were set in the modern way at an angle with the shoulder , not cut like a Magyar blouse as heretofore , this allowed the body part to fit more closely round the waist , which had of course formerly to be very loose to allow the arms to be lifted . One is sometimes recommended to study French manuscripts to get an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities fail the Flemish painters are more  | useful as there was such very close association between Flanders and England at this time . 1483 ? 1509 WOMEN Towards the close of the fifteenth century women 's dress changed entirely in general appearance . The elements of the costume were the same but the line and grace were gone . The skirts of the dress were shorter , there were not so many folds and the whole was rather clumsier and heavier . Fur linings to the overgown were usual and the dress was sometimes pinned up at the back to display them . The head-dresses became smaller and more convenient but much less picturesque . The close hood with the shoulder-piece split so as to form a lappet was a favourite type and the simple square hood was also worn . Both these styles of hoods were often turned back at the front showing the lining , which appears generally to have been white or red , the hood itself being black . The " gable hood " which was a stiffened and elaborated version of the hood made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is surprising that it remained in favour as long as it did . It was used by elderly women down to the days of Elizabeth .  | 1509 ? 1550 MEN THERE is no historic character whose dress is better known to the man in the street than that of Henry VIII . It is said that he is the only character in any of Shakespeare 's plays which has never been played , even in the eighteenth century , in anything but the costume of his period . Very few plays deal with events which occurred in the very early part of the sixteenth century . The costume then worn is never popular with actors , who generally cordially dislike the flowing hair , low-necked shirts and curiously slashed and puffed breeches and hose . Moreover the women 's dress was very unbecoming , so that the illustrations here given deal mainly with the time of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon and after . The costume of this date is familiar to most of us . We all can visualise the nearly square body on its straddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with upturned brim pulled on to the brow . This silhouette was more or less that of all the fashionable males of the time . It was attained with the aid of much padding and puffing , especially of the sleeves , to give width at the shoulders , and many layers of garments on the rest of the body . Those visible were : the shirt at the neck and wrist , where it was often finished with narrow black-embroidered frills , or sometimes with a plain little turn-back collar , and some times with a decided frill . Over this was worn a richly ornamented doublet cut low , often in a square decolletage . Then a jerkin cut down so as to show the front of the doublet almost to the waist . Below the waist in State portraits there is a kind of full skirt or kilt arranged in more or less formal folds . This is a legacy from the fifteenth century . It was put on separately , and was known as the " bases . " It was made of stiff rich material such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gown , which looked immensely full as it was made of heavy rich stuff and almost always had a fur lining , collar and revers . The enormous sleeves were padded very heavily , and the doublet sleeves which showed below were puffed , slashed or embroidered .  | On the legs were worn long hose and trunks . The trunks sometimes reached half way to the knee , sometimes were short enough to be hardly seen . Older men wore a somewhat similar but less exaggerated costume with a long gown , often with long hanging sleeves with apertures through which the hands could be put . The learned professions were apt to retain the fashions of the fifteenth century in a modified form . With very few alterations , all tending to an increased formality , the same type of dress remained in vogue for the rest of the reign and with slight modifications through that of Edward VI . Low hats with upturned brims , or flat caps with a plume on the left side held in place with a brooch , were universally worn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entirely gone . The black coif remained for the elders and the learned professions essions but was worn under a flat cap or biretta-like hat with cut and twisted brim . The hair was cut round evenly and just hides the lobe of the ear . It was cut in a fringe across the forehead or brushed right back between the temples . A gold chain was generally worn , this was put on so as to set as a wide oval from shoulder  | to shoulder over the gown , a fine chain sometimes hangs inside on the doublet in the ordinary way . Shoes were very broad at the toes and cut high on the instep . They were sometimes slashed . The well-to-do citizen wore over his doublet a long gown with hanging sleeves which were slit so that the arm could be put through . His breeches and hose very often showed but little . The more conservative wore long full sleeves . Fur was much in evidence in their turned back collars and revers . For special occasions burgesses wore a kind of livery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , and their use still survives in some cities ; while almost everywhere , the Mayor , at least , has a gown of very similar appearance to that of his predecessor in the sixteenth century , though the cocked hat of the eighteenth century has now replaced the flat cap of the sixteenth in most towns . The smaller traders going about their business still wore a long plain belted gown over a skirted doublet , similar to that of the previous half-century . Their headgear , too , was as a rule the flat cap with a brim , the hood being hardly ever seen except for travelling and as a protection against cold .  | The country people wore a smock-like garment buttoning down the front , with full sleeves gathered in at the wrist like a cuff . A round cloak was worn in bad weather and sometimes a close-fitting hood with a very short cape under a kind of wide-awake hat . The flat cap was worn by all classes in towns with the long gown , doublet and hose , blue being a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful colours , browns and dark greys being favoured by the steadygoing , but the more frivolous appear to have added bright colours when they could . A strong leather belt and a shirt with a soft white turn-down collar completed the outfit of a selfrespecting though unpretentious citizen . Of course , the riff-raff attired itself in the castoff half-worn garments of the well-to-do . 1509 ? 1550 WOMEN The dress of the early sixteenth century Woman is , as it appears in Holbein 's paintings , ' sot superficially very attractive to modern es . One should try to see a set of photo " graphic reproductions of his drawings , as his sitters appear so much more akin to us in these  | wonderful studies than in the equally wonderful but more remote pictures . The gown as worn at court was now definitely cut apart into bodice and skirt , though these were attached to each other , and the sleeves set in . The skirt was often open from the waist down , the opening widening towards the ground , showing an undergown , generally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the lower part of the sleeves . It stood out all round in an almost conical shape and must have been supported by stiffened petticoats . The gown was made of rich material , generally self coloured , but often fur trimmed , especially as regards the sleeves . These sleeves were enormous but were turned back almost to the elbow . The cut of the top of the bodice should be noted . It was cut away almost to the sleeves on the shoulders , then almost down to the armpits , across the bust the lines of the decolletage rose slightly in the middle . The waist line was straight and the skirt set on to it in pleats . The under sleeve was often slashed , showing a white or gold embroidered under-garment through the slashes . In many of the dresses the top of the underbodice was converted into a high dress by a  | stiffened collar with a yoke attached ; the collar part was usually lined with white and was most becoming . It was the ancestor of the splendid standing ruffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary , pleated ruff derives from the gathered fullness round the neck of the chemise or shirt . The head-dresses of the period appear very hard and rather unbecoming in the pictures and monuments of the time . However , if we study Holbein 's drawings , in a great many cases it seems that this depended largely on how they were put on . In many of the drawings there is a twist or angle in the arrangement which was perhaps considered not quite formal enough to be perpetuated in a state portrait , but which does accentuate some beauty or conceal a defect . There is an endless oice in the arrangement of the head-dress d if a number of ladies of the nobility have be dressed , a style can be selected for each w which will suit the individual . They are all sed on a hood , a coif or cap , and a veil , but ese are so differently arranged that it is metimes difficult to distinguish the various rts . The hair shows sometimes , but it is metimes concealed in silken cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining of t he hood is either red or white . Under the  | hood there was worn a cap or a coif and the frill of this generally shows , sometimes being white and often gold . The coif has curious stiffened curved pieces at the side which come forward on to the cheek . With all these separate portions to adjust , the Tudor ladies made endless permutations and combinations . The coif was bent to becoming angles , the sides and ends of the hood could be pinned up , and the back part of the hood and the veil were often arranged so as to form a kind of turban . There were other much less elaborate headdresses which were also worn by ladies of rank , with a becoming curved wing to the coif and a simple veil either swathed round the head or falling down behind . Apparently the ladies of the citizen and rich merchant class did not adopt the very elaborate types of dress worn at court . The long gown undivided at the waist was not entirely out of vogue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hanging sleeves with fur or other rich lining were favoured . A girdle was worn round the waist , keeping the gown trimly confined there , whence it flowed out in folds to the feet . The gowns only just touched the ground , the general effect  | being to give a breadth and squareness to the figure . A rather unusual sort of short jacket or cape , not unlike the yoke piece worn inside the dress of the noble ladies was worn outside by the wives of the well-to-do merchants and citizens . It had turned-back collar points which came low on the neck and showed a neatly gathered under-garment . Wives of the less well-to-do traders wore good woollen dresses with wide sleeves which turned back over full under-sleeves . An apron was very generally worn , made of white Hollands linen . The wives of some of the richer members of the professional and merchant class wore the kennel head-dress on formal occasions but the elaborately swathed arrangements of the veil do not appear to have been adopted . Some wore a simple long black hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies of merchants doing much Flemish trade sometimes used red for the turned-back lining of the hood but white was more usual in England . White head veils still remained in use , sometimes stiffened to suggest an angular head-dress or worn over a curved coif . Working class women had learnt the advantages of shorter dresses , no doubt because they had fires and more comfortable homes than  | in earlier days when the very poor cottages made them dependent on their wearing apparel for warmth . Sleeves were set into the bodice which was fairly close fitting . They were often turned up over the fore-arm showing a white under-garment or the bare arm . The gown was sometimes worn turned up and pinned at the back so as to show the petticoat in " fish-wife " fashion . Aprons were usual . The head was covered with a tail-less hood or a white head cloth pinned at the nape of the neck . Boots of a rather shapeless kind reaching to above the ankle and laced in front were sometimes worn but low broad-toed heel-less shoes were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary there were few very noteworthy changes , except at Court where Spanish fashion influenced the immediate entourage of Queen Mary . The extreme squareness of the silhouette passed with the gradual diminution of the puffing of the upper sleeves . The cloak , as apart from the short gown or coat with hanging sleeves , again came into fashionable use , though the  | long gown with false sleeves remained almost unchanged for older wearers . The fluted skirtlike " bases " were no longer worn and the jerkin in its coat-like form was the principal body garment . Women 's clothes were changing in some respects , not so much perhaps in cut , as in the difference in appearance caused by the general adoption of the stiff cone-shaped farthingale . This spread out the skirt and allowed the under-gown to appear . Of course this had often been the case earlier , but now it was general . The bodices were longer and much more pointed . The curious straight gown was a decided novelty , quite different to anything else . It followed the lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with single bow ties .  | 1559 ? 1603 MEN THE evolution of the long skirted body garment of the early sixteenth century into a short doublet ending at the waist was accomplished in a few years and by the time Elizabeth came to the throne was a fait accompli . The usual costume for men during the first half of her reign which with very slight alterations was in vogue until its close , was a tightfitting garment ending at , or just below , the waist , following the lines of the figure at the back and sides , and more or less padded in front to give a smooth surface . It was generally buttoned from throat to the waist line with close-set buttons . The sleeves were padded but followed the general outline of the arm , being thicker at the top and tapering to the wrist where there was a small ruff . At the top of the sleeve was a slight roll or puff which emphasised the long shoulder seam . The collar  | was a standing one and was headed by a smallish ruff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs were clothed in long tight hose of cloth cut on the cross and closely modelled to the leg . The trunks in England were not as a rule exaggerated to the same extent as on the continent , though they were sufficiently puffed out to make a very conspicuous feature of the costume . They were " paned " as a rule , that is to say cut in strips showing between them a different coloured lining to which they were not fastened . The outer garment was a semicircular cape or cloak , it often had a slight standing collar and was lined with fabric to contrast with or match the outside , rarely , it would appear , was fur lining used . Sometimes also a form of coat , with mock sleeves attached and trimmed to simulate a coat , was slung over the shoulders cloak fashion , sometimes it hung back to front . This seems to have been a very foreign fashion worn by the " bloods . " Swords and daggers were generally carried , and the sword belt followed the doublet 's edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often very elaborate . The whole might be " paned " that is , made up of shaped strips connected here and there with ties or jewelled  | ornaments , or even left unjoined at the front and back allowing glimpses of the under-garment or lining to appear . The linings of the trunks were often rich and they were often puffed out so that the strips were held well apart . Slashes large and small were a frequent form of adornment , and punched holes were sometimes used . In both these decorations glimpses of the lining were shown . " Guarding , " or the application of rows of gilt ribbon or braid , was a revival of an earlier vogue . It is impossible to enumerate the various forms of ornament , as dandies vied with one another in the achieving of strange devices . Grave and reverend seigneurs generally affected a long gown with hanging sleeves and urred revers and sleeve linings . There is a ery interesting example on loan at the Victoria nd Albert Museum of a fine gown of this type ' furred " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles wolf fur , and guarded with gold braid . Such gowns make xceedingly effective attire for elderly men ho have a dignified part to play . They are uitable until about 163o . The shoes were of cloth or leather , often matching the long hose in colour . They had round , broadish toes , a slight heel and no 1  | visible ties , rosettes or buckles . They came up in a point over the instep . The head covering worn in and out of doors was primarily the cap ? the Statute cap as it came to be called at the time when its use was obligatory by law after 1571 on all but people of certain specified rank ? and thereafter , of course , studiously avoided by the really smart people . This cap was much the same as it had been in Henry VIII 's reign but on the whole , slightly smaller . There was also a vogue for the Spanish dap which replaced the flat crown with an Upstanding bag of material pleated so as to stiffen the crown and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coif under flat cap or the cut brim biretta . The rich commoners , those engaged in teachg , and the merchant class seem for a time to ave retained the long skirted doublet in a mewhat modified form , the skirt part being full and shorter . Over this the short coat with puffed sleeves was worn , but except for official use the prevailing fitting doublet and long fairly full trunks were soon adopted though in a much less exaggerated form than in court circles , being without slashings or panings. of course , as we learn from plays and the large number of books dealing with contemporary  | life , there were a number of the citizen class who chose to copy the court fashions as closely as they could , but the ordinary well-to-do trader was quite content to appear what he was ; he was well pleased with his rich gown when appointed to a place of honour such as sheriff or councillor or mayor , but otherwise followed fashion 's changes slowly . These official gowns have become standardised on the sixteenth century lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prototype of the gowns worn by our mayors and other municipal worthies . The flat cap was de rigueuy with the long gown and was generally worn by the ordinary citizen and those of mature age . The man in the street wore full breeches , a short doublet , a " falling band " or turn down collar , a tout belt and the inevitable flat cap . Serving men ( who must not be confused with the " gentlemen , " ? pages , and confidential servants ? who were attached to all great houses and wore the smartest of ordinary fashionable clothing ) and apprentices wore blue gowns , and white broadcloth hose and breeches with simple collar and shirt showing at the neck , a dress much like that of the " Bluecoat " boy . In summer a blue cloak was worn and of course a shirt with a simple turn down collar . no THE COSTUME BOOK  | ELIZABETH-SECOND PERIOD-MEN 'S DRESS Again let me remind you this is not a history of costume , so that I shall not deal with the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompli . The type of dress worn during the earlier part of Elizabeth 's reign continued to be quite usual almost to the end but the puffed short breeches were often worn with long continuations fitting the leg closely , which were called cannions . The body part was also more waisted and the sleeves smaller . More typical after about 158o was a very long waisted , very much padded out body . The extreme form was what has been called the peascod doublet , the padding and fullness being arranged so as to form a most remarkable peak in front . It seems to us one of the most absurd of the many ridiculous fashions which have appeared , yet it was worn by men of importance and position to whom one would have thought such freaks would never have appealed . Still they are to be seen in their portraits wearing this extraordinary prominence which transforms the wearer into the semblance of Puncinello . The vogue lasted some few years . Abbreviated skirts or basques just reaching the hip bone , which were cut in  | circular fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invariably worn , which passes under the point of the peascod . The breeches were generally of the Venetian type . These reached to below the knee and were generally puffed out at the waist , tapering evenly downwards . They were ornamented in the same style as the doublet with slashes or embroidery . Ruffs on the whole were larger and more elaborate , but fairly small ones were favoured by many . The flat cap had entirely gone out as a fashionable headgear after 1570 though some of the older men retained it . The high bonnet form was still to be seen sometimes . The typical head-covering was the hat , usually of beaver or felt . There were many shapes , many of them high in the crown and comparatively narrow in the brim . They were trimmed in various ways , some of them very elaborate , feathers and jewels being the usual forms of ornaments . Hair was worn brushed off the face , and though beards were still worn they were close trimmed and narrower , and many men were clean shaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commoners . Venetians do not seem to  | have been highly favoured but the breeches were full and often paned ; the body of the doublet was longer , but again the extreme of fashion as expressed in the peascod doublet was not adopted . In spite of the capmakers ' protests and even in spite of laws being passed that caps must be worn by all under a certain rank , tall felt hats were generally worn by the ordinary man . Ruffs were obviously not very practical for ordinary every day wear and were either small in size , or the falling band or plain collar was adopted as the neck finish . The countryman still wore a plain skirted doublet with full sleeves and leather belt . He had hose which he tucked into his boots and full breeches almost covered by the skirts of his doublet . In fact he was fifty years behind the times . Representations of farm workers differ little from those of the early days save that they too wear the ubiquitous hat . ELIZABETH-EARLY PERIOD-WOMEN The court fashions for women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps that is why there is  | seldom any wholehearted attempt to reproduce them on the stage . However slender a modern may be , her waist looks enormous in the dresses designed for a small long-waisted figure . The skirts , too , with their many petticoats and the farthingale , are extremely heavy for anything approaching active movement . Of course the original costumes were of silk , and the underwear was of finest lawn and lamb 's wool weighing only about a quarter as much as artificial silk or cotton . One sees actresses who have to run across the stage grasp voluminous but flimsy skirts in one hand and wind them tightly round their legs , showing that the farthingale they are wearing is only a hoop at the waist . With the hoops , padded hips and voluminous petticoats which were really worn as the means of distending the skirt , this effect was of course impossible . The English woman of Elizabeth 's day was obviously a very high spirited and hardy creature . She danced very vigorously , rode on horseback and hunted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate and drank enormously . How she did it one can not imagine . The dresses of the last twenty-five years of the sixteenth century have a very different appearance to those of the early part of Elizabeth 's reign .  | In the first part we find the Spanish Farthingale or cone-shaped under petticoat retained in an exaggerated form , being wider and stiffer . An embroidered or brocaded under-skirt showed where the open front of the over-gown was held apart by the fullness of the farthingale . The curved rim of the decolletage was still a marked feature though the neck was often covered by an ornamental separate yoke piece with standing collar and surrounded by a smallish ruff . Often the dress was tight fitting to the neck like a Victorian bodice . The sleeves though not enormous were heavy but followed the general shape of the arm . At the top of the arm there was a small puff . The stomacher was not yet much in evidence though the body of the gown was pointed at the waist . The bodice was extremely tight fitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation have tried to wear Elizabethan dresses without boning or corsets . The wearer should look as if " poured into the dress , " but even the slightest uncorsetted figure looks thick . The dresses seldom do more than just touch the ground and some are two inches or even more raised from it . Ruffs were fairly small and most often of the simple figure of eight pleated type .  | Head-dresses were worn almost universally , but simplification was the general trend of the fashion . A small hood with a stiffened turn back , with or without a veil of moderate proportions was a usual kind of headgear ; it was a form of the French hood which remained in vogue for so long . It was almost hidden from the front where the hair was frizzed- and worn over a high pad , a rim of trimming or jewels showing over the hair . For outdoor sports , such as riding and hawking , a form of Spanish hat similar to that worn by many men was sometimes used . It had a kind of stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a large proportion of the portraits of this date are of state dress as worn by people of high rank that one rather overlooks the very pleasing head-dresses of a sufficiently ornamental but less extreme kind worn not only by the commonalty but by those of high rank on less formal occasions . The dress for women of the citizen class was very like that of the nobility in cut , though sometimes shorter and generally , it would appear , without the stiffened farthingale . On important occasions such as municipal feasts and other state appearances , the " City madames " were little if anything behind the ladies of the court in the splendour of their  | apparel . There is an amusing scene in the Shoemaker 's Holiday where the newly made sheriff 's wife promises herself a new periwig and French head-dress . In ordinary life a simple hood appears to have been the usual head-covering especially for those who had not the means or the ambition to copy those of the higher rank . About 1570 there was an enactment that the citizens ' wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a " minever cap " which was white and " three square with peaks three or four inches high " was the usual wear for sober matrons , while aldermen 's wives wore similar creations of black velvet . These resembled the gable hoods . The wives of the well paid town craftsmen Wore for best , gowns of good sound material ut in a simple form of the prevailing fashion ith apron and shoulder kerchief . Elderly women wore that curious kind of neck-tie known as a muffler which covered the mouth and chin ? a fashion which helped Falstaff in his disguise as the old woman of Brentford . Country women seem to have worn a tight bodice laced loosely in front over a linen undergarment , a full gored skirt and an apron . On the head they wore a kerchief or hood , and a  | kerchief covered the shoulders . They also wore the muffler described above . ELIZABETH-LATER PERIOD-WOMEN The most noticeable change in the dress of women during the last fifteen years of the seventeenth century was the alteration in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became drum or cylinder shaped , but it does not appear that this form was universally adopted until the beginning of the seventeenth century . At this period we find that quite frequently the skirt of the dress is all of the same material , not parted to show a separate , underskirt , and the bodice has a stomacher which lengthens it below the waist and accentuates the pointed front which in a less marked form had been a feature for so long . Sometimes round the waist there was a frill of the dress material almost like a large ruff which made the skirt appear to stand out from the waist . The sleeves were generally of the leg of mutton type , full and long , the extra length being pushed up to make folds or large wrinkles . There were often turn-back cuffs made of pointed lace . The ruffs were very large and often for full dress were not of the all round type , but stood  | up at the back framing the face . They were supported by " rebatos " or " under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cardboard covered with satin or of strands of wire . These were hidden from the front by the ruff which came close to the neck at the back but showed the neck in front in a wedge shaped opening . This type of ruff seems to have been at this period an extreme form of the fashion almost exclusively confined to the court . The neck of the dress was cut low for court wear . A less extreme form of Spanish farthingale was sometimes worn under a robe opening down the front showing the under-gown . This was borne out in a more rounded fashion and not so widely . An all round ruff as a rule went with this type of dress which was really rather old fashioned though still worn by the country gentry and wives of civic dignitaries as well as by the nobility . The front view of the women at this period in many cases gives one the impression that they have nothing on their heads . This is because the hair is frizzed up over a very high frame filling in the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course almost non-existent in many cases , in others it is supported on large hoops which enable it to be worn with an  | enormous ruff . Such extremes belong to very special dresses for state occasions . A more usual headgear was some form of the French hood , pushed further back on the head than in earlier times in most cases , though the form with the well known dip in the centre also persists . In all these details one notices the increasing formality which marks the later period more than actual change of pattern or style of the garments . Especially at court everything was less and less functional and more and more an opportunity for display . Hats were worn , both of the beaver kind and the velvet made-up type for outdoor exercise such as hunting or hawking , men 's fashions being followed . They seem to have been most usually black or " sad " coloured but the material for judging this point is very scanty . The wives of the rich merchants appear to have adopted the prevailing fashions with as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe to give them about ten years in which to take a new style to their hearts and always they wore a heavier and more discreet type of headdress . Gauze hoods and lace ruffs would not have been approved of by the soberer class . There was however a type among the citizens ' wives who tried to follow every extreme whim of the moment . We meet them in the plays of  | the time , generally laughed at and somewhat despised both by their fellows and those they emulated and often only the dupes of shopkeepers and swindlers of all kinds . The less well-to-do do not seem to have changed much in their dress . Some , who are it appears , rather exceptions , adopt some kind of farthingale , but bunchy petticoats are enough for most . Hats , generally of the beaver type , are much worn by all classes . A coif or kerchief is worn under them and sometimes a long cloak is used for outdoor wear . Of course townswomen such as the wives of craftsmen , small traders and innkeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . The wives of farmers and such people wore a full skirt sometimes opening over a petticoat , a tight fitting bodice with puffed sleeves , a small ruff and a hat . An apron was invariably worn . A cloak was sometimes worn outdoors cold weather and a muffler covered the mouth and chin . Their dress was much the e throughout the reign .  | 1603 ? 1660 MEN 'S DRESS THE traditions of dress that had lasted throughout Elizabeth 's reign , continued without any very startling innovation during the early part of the reign of James the First . What alterations were made took the form of exaggerating what already was exaggerated to the point of unreasonableness . Neither the king nor the queen seem to have had much taste , though both loved magnificence and splendour in dress , and jewels and gold I were squandered in senseless profusion . The long breeches of the type reaching to below the knee were generally worn , and they were enormously stuffed out round the hips making each leg into the shape of an elongated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a prim corset-like appearance . There were nearly always epaulettes on the shoulders and skirts or tabs round the waist , 128  | sometimes a kind of frill , a miniature of that worn by the ladies , the most typical form consisted of large tabs overlapping a little in front . Ruffs were sometimes of the old pleated sort but a kind of stiff sailor collar standing up at the back of the neck and spreading out in front was perhaps more usual . In some cases it was all of lace , sometimes it was made of lawn . The sleeves were often different in colour to the rest of the coat , especially for ordinary wear , and were rather tighter than before . Cuffs of lawn or lace finished them at the wrist . The hats were of beaver with tall crowns and medium brims . Black was the most usual colour for them but claret , cream and other shades were used for special occasions . The tailoring of the clothes of this period was wonderful . It must have taken the proverbial nine tailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were worn for full dress . An example is sketched Figure 105 . It is trimmed all over with a kind of quilting and a multitude of slits or slashes , everything being graduated and tapered off to a nicety . Every button was covered with delicate stitchery and the lace and lawn of the collars and cuffs was of the finest . The lace was generally of the Italian pillow-made type .  | Cloaks were still of the circular sort with a collar and were generally three-quarter length but waist length and quite long ones were also worn . These were generally lined with white . The clothes in Charles I 's reign were far more graceful , and most of the illustrations given belong to the middle of his reign . He was , of course , a man of very artistic tastes and surrounded himself with beautiful things . We think at once of Vandyke in connection with this period and no doubt he influenced lid the selection of the costumes in which he painted his sitters . The mass of minute detail spread all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fashion was abandoned in favour of rich , self-coloured fabrics , especially velvet and damask . All stiffening and padding was done away with . The lace collar was always turned down , but it should be noted that it starts at the top of a high band on the coat . The doublet was still much the same in actual cut , but being without any stiffening it set quite differently . It was often open in the front showing the fine white shirt underneath . There are none of the small slashes and slits which had been so marked a feature earlier but there are sometimes a few large ones on the doublet . More often , however , the shirt shows through the seams which are left unsewn.  | Rows of embroidery and buttons were placed on the sides of the seams of the sleeves and breeches , but were not fastened . Some of the doublets were without skirts and showed the shirt between the waist and the top of the breeches . Bunches of ribbons were much in favour as ornament towards the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were often furnished with little tags like those on shoe laces . The breeches showed great variety in detail but they can broadly be divided into two classes ; those that were pear shaped and tied in at the knee , and the broad open kind . The cloaks were definitely long and were carried wound round the left arm , or had straps on them which held them in place even if thrown right back . Hats had crowns of medium height and were broad in the brim , being often trimmed with plumes . Long boots in brown or black leather were generally worn . The upper part was almost always turned down , displaying the " boot hose . " These were long stockings made of linen and often trimmed with lace , which were worn over the silk stockings to protect them . They were very broad at the top and were turned down with the boot-tops . The hair was worn long in curls or waved  | and a moustache and chin beard were in favour . Gloves were generally worn or carried . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to obtain that effect much thought and time was given . There really was little difference in dress and general appearance between the Royalists and the Cromwellians during the Civil War periods and the succeeding Commonwealth , though it is often convenient for stage purposes to emphasise the distinction between the parties by making the one side dress richly and the other with severity , but this appears not to have much historical authority . There were plain men and dandies on each side but there were , however , some fanatics among the Cromwellians who gave rise to the impression that all Charles ' opponents were ignorant boors , wearing the severest of garments and close-cropped hair . During the war little armour was worn by the officer class , but sleeveless jerkins with skirts made of leather gave good protection and were less cumbrous . Any metal armour strong enough to stop bullets would have been very heavy . Men of the citizen class wore long breeches , at first stuffed to some extent , later without stuffing , and even the round breeches were still used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either tapered or had long skirts . Some elders still approved the long , belted gown . Plain turn-down collars and cuffs to match , and black hats with tall crowns and widish brims gave a plainer version of the fashionable attire . Workers generally wore the long breeches with a shirt , and with or without sleeveless jerkins . This was an economical and convenient dress , and continued through the seventeenth century . The hat was of the tall crowned type in felt for best , a rather shapeless wide awake being used for everyday wear . A smock-shaped garment ( without smocking ) appears in rural scenes ; it opens down the front and has full sleeves put into a cuff band . This kind of dress was general throughout the century and hardly varied . Until the Civil War , servants and apprentices usually wore the long blue gown Ipver breeches and hose together with a flat cap which now survives in the uniform of the Christ 's Hospital ( Bluecoat ) boys . 1603 ? 1660 WOMEN Women 's dress in the early years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Elizabethan garments .  | The waists were narrower and longer ; the farthingale stood out more squarely and further from the hips ; the skirts were even more cylindrical . The ruffs were hardly larger than those worn at Elizabeth 's court but the patterns of the lace were larger and the whole effect was extremely tasteless . These clothes must have been extremely uncomfortable , as iron corsets , whalebone and padding were used wholesale . These excesses were gradually modified towards the end of the reign of James I. Queen Henrietta 's influence accelerated their departure , and soon a rather delightful period of costume began which lasted almost to the end of the century . By about 1635 the general effect of costume was both elegant and comfortable . The dress was somewhat full in the skirt and high waisted . The bodice was close fitting but the waist was not nearly so tight laced as earlier . A somewhat pointed front was retained . The difference in the silhouette is really extraordinary however . Instead of the wasplike figure with the remarkable inflation of the skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy folds of rich material falling naturally . The bodice was cut low , but in the daytime the decolletage was covered by a  | broad lace-edged collar which was a development of the ruff deprived of its stiffening . For full dress , lace edged the neck opening , and also fell in frills from the elbow sleeves over the forearm . Round the waist , the small tabs continued to cover the junction of the skirt and bodice . I t was but rarely that the skirt opened in the front to show an underskirt . Materials were very rich but usually patternless , the finest silks or satins and ( less often ) self-coloured damasks being employed . There was very little embroidery , but the Italian pillow lace employed on the collars and sleeve ruffles was fine and of good design . The fashion in hairdressing changed as sharply as that of the garments . The hair was arranged in ringlets on each side of the , lace and drawn into a knot rather high up at the back of the head . For outdoor wear hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ladies generally went about in their coaches , only alighting for short promenades . Masks were Worn when it was convenient to remain unknown , also veils and kerchiefs tied over the hair . This kind of dress with modifications was worn for a very long time , the period of the Common- wealth having but little influence in changing styles . Naturally , there was some simplification necessary in the Cavalier families whose means were much reduced , but the family of Cromwell had a liking for fine clothes and by no means abjured the " pomps and vanities , " and those attached to the " Court " followed suit . Amongst women of good position the style resembled that of the court but the neck was generally covered by a large lace edged collar and some kind of hip padding was retained after the more fashionable folk had given it up , and the underskirt sometimes shows between the opening of the gown in front . Large hats were worn for walking and fur muffs kept the hands warm in winter . The daughter of a merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demure figure with a long-trained dress , a large double collar , long sleeves with large white cuffs and a long apron , while a London merchant 's wife arrayed for walking has a long dress lifted up to show a full , ankle length petticoat . She wears a high and very large lace-trimmed double collar coming well up to the neck and high crowned broad brimmed hat . The country woman going to market , presumably in her best clothes , has a straw hat ,  | high crowned and very broad brimmed , under which a white cap covers her hair . She has a low cut dress with long sleeves and epaulettes in a bygone fashion . Her shoulders and neck are covered with a plain kerchief the ends being tucked into the front of the gown . A coloured petticoat trimmed with braid at the bottom and a large white apron complete a very sensible and attractive dress .  | 1660 ? 1700 MEN 'S DRESS WITH the Restoration there came no sudden change in men 's fashions . During the period of the Commonwealth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but those in high places on occasion were inclined to be as richly apparelled as those of a Royal court , and the more frivolously minded could be and were frivolous indeed in their clothes . The first few years of Charles ' reign saw simply a development of the garments of the previous twenty years . The doublet was reduced to a short skirtless jacket with buttons and buttonholes close set down the front ; they were , however , seldom fastened , but fell slightly apart showing the fine lawn shirt beneath . The sleeves were shortish and often slightly open at the seam , while at the wrist the shirt showed as a puff edged by a frill . It was also seen in the gap between the jacket and breeches . The breeches were wide , sometimes being almost tubular , and sometimes extremely full   and so cut as to look almost like a petticoat ; sometimes they were actually long but turned up at the bottom to form a series of pockets . Round the neck was worn the turn down square collar which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmed with a profusion of ribbons , sometimes tagged , and often of various colours . The edges of the jacket and its sides , the edges of the breeches , and the bottom of the sleeves , were all adorned with fringes or bunches of ribbon . Over a hundred yards were sometimes used in this way . The seams were outlined in gold or silver lace and the buttons were embroidered to match . Long boots were generally worn and with them laceedged long hose were always used , silk stockings and low shoes tied with ribbon were also worn . The favourite colours were cream and grey . Black was the usual colour for the hat which was almost invariably the large black beaver , but other colours were also used . This type of dress was really in vogue as early as 1658 , in its most elaborate and frivolous be-ribboned forms . It hardly accords with the general idea of the plain and serious life that was led in England under the Commonwealth , but the clothes of the last years of the Commonwealth are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Somewhere about 167o there was a sudden change in men 's fashions and the square figure with fluttering ribbons disappeared and in its place appears a slim close-fitting coat , tight to the figure as far as the hips with a slightly increased breadth below . There were buttons and button-holes on this garment , but they were only fastened at the top , the lower part being left open to show the waistcoat . With this were worn either wide breeches or nearly close-fitting breeches buttoned at the knee , or both these together . Shoes and stockings were more usually worn than boots . The plumed beaver was still the " only wear " practically and the periwig was worn all through this period . It was constructed on natural lines and the hair fell in profuse curly strands as if from the head , not in formal horizontal curls as is so often seen on the stage . This type of costume , getting gradually heavier and more formal , continued until about 1702 . Middle-class men wore the doublet with large tabs and long full breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionables . They never adopted the short jacket and preposterously full breeches but towards the end of the century turned to the long skirted coat , in a rather less waisted form and , of course , minus the profusion of trimming usual at Court .  | Plain white falling bands of lawn tied by two cords , the small tassels of which show slightly in the middle between the points of the bands and a rather low crowned broad brimmed hat were usual . A long cloak with a somewhat high collar was used as an outdoor garment and high boots were worn for riding or rough walking . The hair was worn longish but not in curls . The whole costume was very similar to that shown in Figure 138 . The general conception of the Puritan is really very much that of the usual everyday costume of ordinary moderately wellto-do quiet gentlepeople and the professional classes . They made no attempt to follow closely the vagaries of the Court but adopted , in time , anything that suited them and ignored the rest . 166o ? 1700 WOMEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little change from what had been worn for thirty years or more . The hair was dressed in ringlets each side of the head . By the very fashionable these were set out on wires and were often made of false hair ; they were rather longer but fewer in number than before . The rest of the hair was arranged in a kind of knob or " bun , " high on  | the back of the head often being enclosed in a net . Self-coloured silks and satins were the favoured materials for dresses , light and bright colours appear in many portraits and are also described in the diaries of the period . The bodice was perhaps a little longer than earlier . The neck was cut low and the lace collar ? the last remnant of the ruff , was no longer the fashion . A light gauze scarf was sometimes attached to the neck line and the under-garment also shows as a kind of tucker . It shows sometimes , too , between the bows or other fastening of the bodice , through the opening down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeve on the forearm . The skirts of the dresses are very full and though there is no formal farthingale they appear to have been supported slightly on the hips . Shoes were high heeled and square toed with uppers of silk matching the dress . They were tied with ribbon bows . Pattens to match them were worn for walking to protect the silk . The staider members of the nobility and those who did not aspire to follow the more frivolous diversions of the court of Charles II retained much of the rather stiffer style of dress which was a relic of the pre-Commonwealth days . They continued to wear a collar over the shoulders , a boned bodice and closer head- dressing . The change in men 's dress about 167o did not affect women 's attire . The costume in vogue after 1780 was very different , it was much trimmer . The hair was still dressed in curls but these were pinned high over a frame on the front of the head , except one or two which hung over the shoulder . The bodice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it parts to show the under-garment ( or an ornamental front ) over which it is fastened with ribbons . They are often arranged in formal strips or bows like the rungs of a ladder . The short sleeve remained in favour showing the under-garment as a full puff trimmed with a lace flounce at the elbow . A farthingale or hoop is quite obviously the means of setting out the skirts , which generally consist of an underdress hanging straight down and an overdress which is looped back to form panels and a kind of bustle . The most fashionable head-dress was the Fontange , commode or tower , a stiffened erection of lace and ribbon bows which rose from the crown of the head . Over the back of the head was worn a linen or lawn cap with lappets . A very usual way of dressing the hair was to pile it in curls on the top of the head , well to the front , and throw a gauze scarf tightly over  | the back of the head . The addition even of the scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country woman was not unlike that which , up to the middle of the nineteenth century was worn as a national costume by Welshwomen . The petticoat was of good sound woollen goods , russet , wincey or serge , while over it was worn a gown of lighter woollen pinned up at the back . Over the shoulders a neck kerchief or small shawl was pinned . An apron ? of woollen stuff or blue checked linen was tied round the waist . A white cap ( not frilled ) was worn on the head and over this a black kerchief was draped and knotted under the chin . The beaver hat and red cloak were worn for market and church going by farmers ' wives and such people . The townsfolk favoured a gown with full skirt , with a close bodice lacing up the front over a kerchief covering the shoulders . The sleeves ere elbow length with full sleeves showing underneath . A large apron of holland was always worn . A white kerchief was knotted under the chin and a high crowned beaver or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations ( Figures 138 , 139 , 141 and 144 ) may be followed for the different townspeople of this period . Though published later the dresses would be quite suitable after about 169o.  | THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY COSTUME in the eighteenth century was in a constant condition of change as to minor details , though in its essentials it altered little . The variations for the first seventy years or thereabouts were caused less by the personal preference of the reigning monarch than by a general following , by all who would be thought fashionable , of a small clique who made such matters their chief preoccupation . Many of the alterations were foolish extravagances , and were confined to fops and dandies and had little influence on general taste ; others were matters of minor details . Some fashions persisted all through the century , others lasted for quite a short time . It would be impossible to give every change or modification in such matters as the arrangement of the wig , the exact hang of the coat , the length of the waistcoat or the cock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for illustrations which show interesting and  | characteristic modes , and unless a play demands very great historical accuracy for a certain date , one or other of these styles will probably be found to give the required effect . ( All concerned must however bear in mind that , with eighteenth century modes , correct wearing is almost as important as the cut of the dress , if not more so . ( Unless the actor will be at some pains to carry his costume correctly , it is little use for those responsible for designing and making it to spend time and trouble in fitting him out with the proper historical cut of coat , or cock of hat . ) He must learn the " nice conduct of a clouded cane . " 1700-1730 MEN 'S DRESS The beginnings of eighteenth century costume date back to the days of Charles II , but by the first decade they had crystallised into the familiar long coat , waistcoat and knee breeches with the accompaniment of wig , cocked hat and snuff-box . The coat of the early eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sleeves showed the shirt below the cuff , being cut short just above the wrist . They were of medium breadth , and much narrower  | than the cuffs , which were enormous , reaching up to the elbow and correspondingly wide across . They were fastened up to the main sleeve by three buttons and buttonholes set horizontally . The coats were furnished with ornamental flaps concealing the real pockets , and their positions varied from time to time , but the most usual was just below the hipline . The dropped neckline was a noteworthy point . There were pleats set on the sides to give freedom of movement and the side seams were unsewn from the waist downwards . The back was also unsewn although it could be fastened by buttons , it however was always left unfastened . Fastenings were more for show than use , as even on the front of the coat only a few buttons at the neck and two or three below the waist were ever actually fastened . The material of the suit was often plain cloth or velvet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were sometimes of rich silk , were long , about six or seven inches shorter than the coat . They had two low set pockets , and buttons were placed on them from top to bottom but the last eight or ten buttons were left undone . The cuffs were turned back over those of the coat . Breeches fitted closely on the lower part of  | the leg but the back was cut full . As only about five or six inches ever show one does not notice them much . Still , they must be properly fitted . The stockings are rolled well over the knee and were often ensuite as to colour with the suit . The shirt was of fine lawn or cambric and shows as a full puff at the wrist filling the coat cuff and ending in frills three or four inches wide . The shoes were broad and had tongues and unobtrusive buckles . The heels were sometimes red . Wigs were full-bottomed , hanging behind in curls . They were smooth over the crown but in front they were dressed very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , not powdered white , though scented powder was used to perfume them . Hats were fairly large and the brims were turned up in three even divisions , the peak being in front . The crown was highish so as to avoid crushing the erection of curls over the front of the head . They were , however , not often actually placed on the head . A cane was a usual part of the equipment of a man of fashion but as he wanted at least two hands to deal properly with his snuff-box and handkerchief , he often suspended it by a loop from one of his waistcoat buttons .  | The general effect of a gentleman 's costume is formal , almost heavy . The coat hangs loosely at the front but smoothly at the back , less , however , by closeness of fit than by the balance caused by the weight of the pleats which draw it into position . The costume allows an easy , dignified carriage without stiffness or constraint anywhere , when properly cut and fitted . Less well-to-do people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , while wearing clothes of similar cut chose quieter colours and smaller cuffs , they used plain woollen cloth and woollen stockings and did not indulge in the large and very expensive wigs . Their shirts were of thicker linen and plain bands finished the wrists , and plain cravats were worn . Their hats were often only turned up once , that is over the face , and had rather low crowns . Their shoes were heavier and did not sport the red heels favoured by the ultra-smart . The lower middle-class men wore a long coat with buttons all down the front much like a smock , and a broad brimmed low-crowned hat as a working garb . This buttoning up of the coat is a noticeable feature in the series of " Cries of London " which illustrate the dress of the itinerant traders and other " characters " of the City . It points to the absence of a waistcoat .  | The dress shown in the " Cries " could be used almost without change for similar characters any time from the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CENTURY-WOMEN The main elements of fashionable dress which were a survival from the last decade of the seventeenth century remained the same throughout the greater part of the eighteenth , the difference ( and what a difference ! ) lay in the manner in which they were worn and the head-dress of the different periods . The full gown , worn over a rich petticoat which showed more or less according to the arrangement of the gown , the open neck , elbow sleeves and pointed bodice varied in detail as time went on , but in essence they were the same . 1700 ? 1730 WOMEN 'S DRESS When Queen Anne came to the throne the overdress was long , touching the ground all round and for full dress having a slight train behind . It generally opened in the front showing the petticoat which was of rich material , and often the same as the gown . Often the gown  | was looped or bunched up giving a slight bustle effect at the back . The petticoat was often quilted . A plain diamond pattern with a border at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also carried out . The work was done on a foundation of strong but open linen and the top layer was of sarcenet or satin . Between these was sandwiched a thin layer of lamb 's wool inserted in small pieces as the work proceeded , not spread all over beforehand . The pattern was done in small close running stitches which were pulled pretty tight so that the material rose up between the rows of stitches in small puffs . The under-petticoats were full but were not at first supported by hoops . Bodices were very tight fitting , hooking or lacing in front over a busk which kept the figure stiff and firm , corsets also being worn . The V in front was often filled with an embroidered stomacher or with Mechlin lace on a silk foundation attached to the corset which showed between the lacing . The neck was cut low and square in front but fairly high at the back . The sleeves finished about the elbow where there was generally a cuff of folded silk below which came a ruff of lace or fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of bodice was also much favoured which showed  | no opening in front but finished in the middle with a few loose pleats caught together with a jewel . Inside the square neckline was an irregular frill of muslin or lawn which was in reality the top of the same under-garment which in inch dresses appears at the open seam of the sleeves and below the cuff . With these dresses the natural curled hair is worn without a head-dress , or at most a gauze scarf is thrown over the back of the head . An apron of fine lawn or lace was often worn even with full dress . The shoes were of silk damask or brocade with large high heels . A strip of metal braid generally ran from toe to instep . They had a tongue but came well up on the instep and were fastened with bows . The hair was worn in its natural colour and arranged in curls in the front and fell at the back , sometimes in long curls . The commode head-dress was worn for dress occasions , theatregoing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff pleats of fine lace set in a formal fan-like crest . Ribbon loops were sometimes used in its construction . At its back a stiffish cap was set and lappets often completed the erection . It is about the ugliest head-dress ever invented and makes the prettiest face look plain , while the elderly appear ridiculous in it .  | Dresses were made of silk , often patterned , especially damasks and brocades . Imported cottons were also eagerly sought after . These had elaborate patterns on them which are often spoken of as being printed but were actually accomplished by a combination of hand painting and dyeing . Mittens were worn , both black and coloured . The mittens of the early eighteenth century are not like the Victorian variety . They more nearly resemble gloves with the palm and fingers omitted . There is no thumb-piece and they are ugly and clumsy . Long gloves to the elbow were used for outdoor wear . Patches accentuated a dimple or pointed a smile . Less fashionable people and the working classes continued to wear the clothes described at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types are valuable as they give the costume of such people for a period dating from about i6go . They changed but little save for minor details throughout the eighteenth century . The dress worn by the orange seller is that used by respectable women of the working classes and small tradespeople.  | 1730 MEN BOUT 173o a great change in the silhouette of the smart an began . There was no revolutionary alteration in the cut of the coat , though there were more pleats in the " fans " at the sides . The change was caused by the stiffening of the sides of the skirts of coats and waistcoats , especially the latter , so that as worn by fops and extremists the skirts of the coats were extended almost to the line of the women 's skirts . It was an extraordinary mode and in its extreme form was confined to a comparatively small circle consisting of Sir Foppling Flutter and his like . But even for those who did not go so far the skirts were definitely wider at the sides . The height of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeves were broad with enormous cuffs buttoned up to the forearm with three buttons . The coats had many medium-sized buttons ,  | often left entirely unfastened or just a few of them were buttoned at the neck and waist . There was a small collar-band but it did not button and the neck was cut very low . The large pouch-shaped pocket flaps were generally placed on the hips . The waistcoat , which was most usually of the same material as the coat and breeches , some- I times differed in material from the coat , and for full dress was edged or even covered with embroidery . It was long , almost to the knee . and the close set buttons were unfastened at the top and bottom , in fact , the last few buttons were not even provided with button-holes . It was cut low in the neck and had a very narrow collar-band . The breeches hardly show but were cut very close in the lower part of the leg so as to give a neat foundation for the stocking which was drawn over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium height . The tongue stood up well away from the foot and was of medium size . The shirt was sometimes frilled or set in close pleats and appeared at the wrist as a cuff from which depended ruffles of fine needle point or lawn . The cravat , too , was ' of lace and was often headed with a black ribbon which started from that which tied the wig at the back , and formed a bow in the front .  | The cravat or shirt frill was fully displayed by the open-necked waistcoat . At times the ends of the cravat were tucked inside the waistcoat and often no cravat was worn , the neck being finished with a folded band buckling under the wig at the back . In this case the wrist of the shirt sported no frills . It was definitely the mode of the time for the " best people . " The stockings often matched the suit in colour and were always of silk for the fashionable and were rolled over the knee . The hat was a formal tricorne and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally low or fairly low . The brim was often edged with galloon . Wigs were very various . They were generally tied at the back with a black ribbon and arranged in curls over the ears . The smart man had his powdered , in fact powder was becoming general for the nobility and gentry . It is the period of the typical " queue " and powdered curls . The full wig however , was still worn by the fashionable , indeed , an enormous variety of shapes appear . The " bag wig " is a curious kind . The black appendage contained , or was supposed to contain , the curls , which were thus prevented from marking the coat with powder . It is the most becoming fashion for a young man .  | The effect of the whole costume was more magnificent ( perhaps one might almost say " showy " ) than that of the beginning of the century . It showed off a slim figure to perfection if well worn . It is not so becoming to the well-covered man , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the face . Older men and those who did not follow fashion closely did not favour the highly stiffened skirts which the dandies affected . In other matters their dress was much as described above . The full periwig was still very generally worn by those who considered it more dignified than the queue in its various forms , and it was usual at Court . Tradesmen and professional men wore full-skirted coats of the prevailing type , generally in one of the soberer and more useful colours ( though this was not always the case ) with unstiffened skirts and of course no swords . Plain linen , simple buckles on the shoes and smaller cuffs give a subdued effect to the costume . As a rule they wore their own hair without powder , simply tied at the back . Others wore a rather bushy , shortish wig . It was mainly a question of convenience and cost . Many of them were as well dressed as their clients . Style was largely a matter of carriage and manner .  | Personal servants were often very well dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobe , were only a very little behind the extremes of fashion . Porters , labourers and such people while engaged in active work , wore rather loose knee breeches , coarse stockings gartered below the knee and rough shirts open at the neck . Some wore broad-brimmed uncocked hats with low crowns , others wore a kerchief tied on the head , somewhat in the traditional pirate fashion . The dresses shown in Figures 138 and 139 can be followed for townspeople , street vendors and so on . C. 1730 WOMEN The change in women 's dress during the first thirty years of the century was very marked . Somewhere about 1720 hoops had been reintroduced ; they were at first round or cone shaped , then they gradually flattened a little back and front and spread out at the side , reaching later to an enormous lateral spread . In 1730 , however , the extreme width had not been reached though it was considerable . Most dresses were ankle length , a train being added to those worn on very special occasions .  | They were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the mode . The bodice was very tightly laced , a long round figure with a flattened bust being aimed at . There was often an ornamental stomacher of fine lace or embroidery on silk . A favourite arrangement for filling in the V at the front of the dress was the echelle ? a succession of flat bows larger at the top than towards the waist , or the bodice might be simply laced . A muslin scarf sometimes softened the neckline or a slightly kilted tucker of muslin or lawn appeared inside the dress . This really was the full top of the smock , an under-garment with sleeves which sometimes appeared below the elbow sleeves of the dress . The sleeves of the dress were just elbow length and were edged with lace frills . There was sometimes a puff between the frill and the dress , but this survival was not universal . The kind of arrangement of pleats known as the Watteau pleat or robe a la Francaise , was in vogue . Added material was put into box pleats and started on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist where it combined with the fullness of the skirt . The skirt of these dresses frequently opened in the front , and the sides of the opening and also of the V opening of the bodice  | were often edged with a flat fold of the material . The sleeves were the same as those of ordinary dresses and the neck opening was always square and fairly high at the back . The petticoat was often quilted and sometimes appeared when the gown had a front opening but rather more often perhaps it was covered by a pinner or apron which simulated a complete under-skirt . There was a complete change in the method of arranging the hair and the head-dress . The towering Fontange was gone , though sometimes a small low kilted lace bow was worn . Its place was taken by caps with frills and lappets or gauzy scarfs . The lappets were often tied up on the top of the cap with a ribbon bow . Sometimes there was no head covering or a small floral ornament only was worn . The hair , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curled at the side and was arranged in sausage curls behind . In some cases it was cut short and brushed close to the head at the back . Straw hats with simple ribbons round the crown were worn over the frilled caps for walking , and for riding broad-brimmed beavers with or without a plume were worn . Very little jewellery was worn on ordinary occasions but at Court large diamond orna- ments were used in profusion . A string of pearls tight to the neck was the favourite finish . Shoes were made of silk and had high heels . Sometimes they were of the same material as the dress . Muslin or silk aprons were very generally worn . They were small and square at the bottom . All materials used were of the richest , and in extravagant circles the luxury in dress was colossal . In less frivolous families the effect was one of charming , well-bred simplicity .  | C. 1750 MEN 'S DRESS THERE was not a great deal of difference in the general cut of men 's clothes in 1750 from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for very much stiffened skirts to the coats was passing away but it was still affected by extremists . A rather trimmer effect is given to the coat by the somewhat higher neck which was at this date often cut at the collar line . The coat was frequently trimmed with galloon and rich embroidery and the seams were often outlined with passementerie . The sleeves were narrower and the cuffs a little smaller . The coats were hardly ever buttoned even part of the way , so the fronts were cut a trifle narrower . The coat was about knee length . The breeches showed more than in earlier times , as the waistcoat and coat were shorter . They fitted with great precision and fastened on the outside of the leg with three or four  | buttons , or were buckled . They were often of different material to the coat and waistcoat . Stockings were often worn under the breeches at the knee , though many wore them over . The waistcoat like the coat was of very rich material for full dress , often being stiff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming to about mid thigh and falling well apart in front owing to the sides being stiffened . The back and sides of the lower part were often of the same texture as the front , as owing to the stiffening of the coat the unsewn seams parted and these portions of the waistcoat showed . Shirts might either be frilled and worn with a buckled band or plain and with a knotted or passed cravat , and the cuff frills might be simply of fine lawn or lace edged . Wigs were mostly of the queue kind in fashionable circles , older men still wore the full wig and the bag wig was worn by some young ones , while professional men and others wore the round wig . There were many varieties and some even had a political significance . Powder was general for dress wear . The ribbon ties were invariably black . Shoes had medium heels , large tongues and elaborate buckles . They were cut rather high on the ankles . Stockings were often white and were generally  | of silk . The tricorne hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was worn out of doors and carried indoors under the arm . The professional classes and well-to-do tradesmen dressed in much the same general style as the more fashionable people . Medical men wore ( lark clothes without a sword and lawyers wore the gown and bands of their calling . Small tradesmen and clerks buttoned up their coats and wore shirts that lacked frills . The commonalty favoured knee breeches , a full shirt and short skirtless coats with a handkerchief knotted round the neck and uncocked broad-brimmed felt hats . Heavy shoes with tongues and ties , " highlows , " and knee-high boots are all to be seen . The dresses were often very splendid and the enormous hooped skirts showed off the beautiful ( and very large ) designs of Spitalfields silks and Indian chintzes and the delicate texture of fine muslins and satins . The skirts were supported by various contrivances of iron hoops , whalebone , or cane , so that they stood out , in some cases , as much as two feet on each side of the figure . These  | were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wearers and general inconvenience to everyone else . The bodice and skirt were combined in one garment , often with the so called Watteau pleat at the back . In the front the bodice was arranged so that to all appearances it was separate . Both skirt and bodice were generally so cut at the front that the bodice parted in a V narrowing to the waist , while the inverted V of the skirt grew wider towards the ground . In the skirt opening the petticoat appeared , it was often embroidered or quilted . Many skirts , however , showed no opening at the front . There were also dresses which showed no opening either on bodice or skirt in the front . Aprons of silk or fine muslin were very generally worn even on dress occasions , ? more for ornament than use of course . Bodices were very tight though often they did not meet in the front , but the fit was maintained by false fronts which were laced close to the figure . Between these was an ornamental stomacher attached to the corset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of a fichu or kerchief draped over the shoulders and brought down to the waist .  | These fichus often covered the whole neck though the actual opening was very low and square . Sometimes the fichu was caught together with a stiff two-eared bow . In many cases the V shape was filled in with an echelle which consisted of a number of bows one below the other , each a little smaller and shorter than that above it , down to the point of the bodice . The space between was filled by fine muslin or lace frills . These echelles were a persistent fashion throughout the century . The sleeves were of elbow length but there was either no cuff or only just a fold of the silk . They were generally finished with two frills of lace or muslin , one , generally narrower than the other , turning up , while the broader one hung down onto the forearm . The puff of lawn which was part of an undersleeve no longer appeared on fashionable garments . It is really only in minor details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , the general effect being on the whole trimmer and neater . The hair was worn turned back from the face and curled or waved at the sides and drawn to the back . Caps of lawn and lace trimmed with ribbon were generally worn . Lappets were usually pinned or tied up but in some cases hung over the shoulders .  | Straw hats with ribbon trimmings and strings were worn for country diversions over a frilled cap . Less well-to-do women of the better classes wore less wide skirts , and lawn frills instead of lace . For those who did not aspire to rank as gentry , the short petticoat worn under a pinned up gown , the bodice of which was laced over a white under-garment which showed as a cuff and frill at the elbow was usual . Some wore a frilled cap with a hat outdoors though the black scarf or kerchief , knotted at the chin over a white cap , still survived ? it was a useful head-covering and had a very long life . The country women wore a very similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor wear . Aprons were always worn . They were set full into a band and the strings brought round and tied in front . White linen was the usual material but that with a blue plaid-like pattern woven in it was also used . Wide brimmed straw or felt hats over a cap or white kerchief tied under the chin were worn by old and young . The picturesque milk-maid was still a feature of the London streets with her pails slung on a yoke or carried on her head , her costume being practically identical with that shown in Figure 141 save that the loose crossover bodice is usually seen .  | C. 1770 MEN BY the ' seventies a transformation had been effected in the silhouette of the man of fashion . He was now shorn of all excrescences . The coat was narrow , the fronts being cut right away and the pleats reduced to a minimum . It was often worn entirely unbuttoned , or a few buttons at most were fastened on the chest . The collar was cut decidedly higher and there was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a slight revers . The sleeves were of wrist length and had medium sized or quite small cuffs . Elaborate embroidery was often used on the coats , being actually worked on the material , not just applied or in bands . Buttons , too , were often an ornamental feature , being fairly large and decorative . They were sometimes embroidered and sometimes of metal garnished with paste or even diamonds , large ornamental buttonholes or " frogs " were much used .  | The breeches are very important at this time as their fit is displayed by the cutaway fronts and short waistcoats . They show to below the knee and are buttoned on the outside over the stockings . In colour they are often a contrast to the coat . The waistcoat often matches the coat and is short and sometimes cut low at the top . The shirt is not much in evidence beyond the small ruffles showing at the wrist and on the chest . The cravat is often of fine lace and a black ribbon might be brought round from the queue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow in front . The stockings were frequently , but not invariably , of white silk . The shoes come high over the instep and they fasten over large tongues with important buckles or have quite small tongues and flat buckles . The heels are fairly low . Wigs were beginning to pass out of fashion , to the great annoyance of the hairdressers , the wearer 's own hair being cut short at the sides where it is dressed high above the ears in horizontal curls . The front was brushed back and kept fairly high . The back portion was long and tied with a bow of large proportions at the back . The older men and country squires made little changes in their dress or  | hairdressing from what they had worn in their youth , so that the long full coat and long waistcoat were still to be seen , though the stiffened fronts had vanished , and well-to-do but unfashionable people ( often of high rank ) prided themselves on not following the mode , so that much contrast was seen . Great eccentricities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress were practised by dandies about this time , but those who went to these extremes were very few indeed . They were the rather emptyheaded set known as the Macceronies ; started by young men who had returned from making the Grand Tour . The wig they favoured was enormously high in front and worn turned up and tied in a " catogan " at the back . This fashion was accompanied by a very small tricorne hat , a very short coat , tight breeches , often striped , and a thick tasselled cane . Their affected carriage and atrocious manners matched their exaggerated attire . What a nuisance they must have been ! The most outrageous examples of the Macceroni type of dress do not appear until the mid-seventies and must not be considered as representing the general attire of the time . They were just a bid for notoriety on the part  | of that section of society which is unhappy unless it is in the limelight . The style had its male and female votaries and was not confined to the young people . C. 1770 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventies lent itself to exaggeration . At its best it could be picturesque , dignified and even graceful ; at its worst it was fussy in outline , overloaded with purposeless ornament and indeed , entirely unreasonable . The skirt was still very fully distended but in a bell-shaped fashion . Side hoops had utterly disappeared and the extension of the skirt was mainly a matter of multitudinous petticoats and puffings and loopings of the overgown , though the effect was aided by small horse-hair pads and underskirts of stiff material . The overdress consisted of skirt and bodice combined . The loose pleats from the shoulders were little used except for Court wear and some of the bodices were cut entirely separately , though these were sewn to the lower part . The majority of the gowns were cut in " princess " fashion as to the back , the upper part being very close-fitting . Some have pleats  | stitched closely to the lining , which follow the lines of the figure at the back and merge into the skirt at the waist . The decolletage was square cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The sleeves were tight fitting and came to the elbow , where they were finished with frills which covered the forearm . There were often three frills , generally of lace , the bottom one being the longest and each hanging so as just to show the border of the one below it . One of the leading fashions was the polanaise . This was an arrangement of the skirts into three puffs , one each side and one at the back , the fullness being regulated by strings which transformed a freely hanging skirt into panniers . Underskirts were definitely an important part of the costume and were sometimes of the same material as the gown . Quilting and petticoats were no longer en evidence , but were still worn beneath the overskirt and helped to give the required fullness . Fichus were very generally worn to modify the lowness of the neck . Very wide black scarves edged with frills and made of silk , were a popular wrap . This fashion lasted a very long time , being seen in the 1730 's and lasting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wearing aprons of silk or lace on dress occasions and even when out walking was not abandoned . The aprons were often of quite substantial size and though generally of silk or of lace-trimmed lawn or muslin , were sometimes quite plain . At about this time the elaboration of hairdressing reached its zenith . The enormous erections of false hair , lace , ribbon , flowers and jewels appear seldom to have been actual wigs except where hair was lacking . The wearer 's own hair was used as a basis and eked out by pads , and where necessary added to . If possible , people acting parts representing young and lovely women of this time will do well to follow the same plan or else to obtain a first-rate wig . The cheap ones are dreadful . Powder of course was almost universal . Hats were worn for walking and riding . Enormous straws with shallow crowns and trimmed with ribbons were used in the country where the coiffure was not so extreme , and small ones lavishly trimmed were poised at an acute angle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were worn for riding and the tricorne was also still used . The caps were of a very characteristic shape dictated by the high dressing of the hair . They rose to a point in front and framed the  | face in a very charming fashion . A similar shape in black silk was sometimes worn out of doors . Shoes were fairly high heeled and were made of silk or kid . They had pointed toes and were cut much lower than those earlier . Buckles were used to fasten them and the strip of metal embroidery which was so long used as a trimming was now never seen . Long gloves to the elbow were much worn . Fans , too , were carried on every occasion . Long canes and muffs were seen when people went walking . Muffs , by the way , were often carried by men . Country folk wore just the same as in the ' fifties except that the straw hat was oftener worn by the younger women than the black felt .  | C. 1790 MEN THE general note in men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier fashions were still often worn , such as the cut-away coat and the old pleated coat with a long waistcoat , which was very often preferred by elderly men . The most up-to-date wear was a coat which in many ways resembled the " tails " of the present day if we imagine the buttons fastened . These coats were cut off straight in front and then sloped away towards the back . There were large revers at the neck opening and the doublebreasted front was in general actually fastened . The more usual style was a cut-away coat with high collar and large buttons which were left undone . The collar was often of the stand-up turndown type and rather high . The sleeves were long with no cuff . Sometimes there was a slit in the sleeves at the wrist marked by  | three or four buttons which showed a glimpse of the shirt . The waistcoat was short and sometimes had revers which fell over the coat . This , however , was an advanced mode coming into general use a few years later . Breeches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they were quite long so as to meet the boots , when these were worn . The shirt , which was frilled , came into view , as the top of the waistcoat was left unbuttoned ; it also sometimes showed at the cuff where a simple cuff band or hemmed frill protruded . The cravat , too , was not lace trimmed and owed its smartness to its fineness and accuracy of tying . The hat was worn in varying forms . The tricorne was by no means abandoned but the double fold was more usual . The most up-todate headgear was the ancestor of the modern " topper . " It had sloping sides to the crown and a fairly narrow brim which was sometimes slightly curled . The natural hair was generally both uncurled and unpowdered . Wigs were , however , worn by professional and elderly men . Shoes were fastened either with buckles or shoestrings but boots were a later fashion . The sword was not now worn by civilians ;  | a cane or walking stick was usually carried . The cane was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain cap top . The very newest fashions were not perhaps always worn by those highest in rank or society . They to some extent at first had some connection with political ideas . Men of business and staid professional men did not accept the new fashions and as a rule still wore the skirted coat , a cravat , and a tricorne hat , and prided themselves on their neat stockings and trim buckled shoes . The clergy still wore the full black gown and bands . For best wear farmers and country people generally wore a quiet version of the fashions of bygone years , the skirted coat with or without a waistcoat , a plain shirt , and a black tricorne hat being the usual holiday attire . The breeches have the loose cut at the knee , being always a little baggy . For daily wear the smock with a flat wide-awake hat , breeches and woollen stockings with half-boots with or without gaiters were a general dress . C. 1790 WOMEN There was a growing feeling for simplicity in the dresses , though some details such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had quite gone , though the dresses were still set out by voluminous petticoats and pads and puffings . The overgown and petticoat still formed the basic idea of full dress , though the former might be reduced to the dimensions of a caraco jacket and the latter be almost a complete dress for less formal wear . The overgown took many shapes of which the polonaise remained the favourite when looping was resorted to at all . Most generally it hung down in simple folds , being slightly trained and a trifle longer than the petticoat . The bodice of the overgown followed the traditional mode , being laced or tied over an ornamental front . There were no folds on the back ( except for court wear ) . The sleeves were elbow length and had small frills . The waist was often round and the skirt part set into it all round in gathers . The petticoat was of silk or embroidery and was often flounced . The dress of a simple , almost modern kind was becoming very popular for informal and home wear . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flounce , or sometimes two . A sash was often worn round the waist and a fichu at the neck .  | Hats were of enormous proportions or rather the trimming made them look so . There were hats trimmed with masses of ribbon gauze and silk arranged to a towering height and word over a cap ; and others less massive in which the crown and brim were not completely obscured and were trimmed with plumes and loops of ribbons rather more sparsely applied . For riding , hats like those worn by men , the not so distant ancestors of the topper , were preferred by the more sporting ladies , while beavers with plumes were the choice of those who took their riding less seriously . Simple straw hats were reserved for the country but if one may judge by the engravings of the time people went picnicing and fishing in surprisingly elaborate toilettes . The hair was very gracefully arranged in a profusion of natural-looking curls sometimes unpowdered for undress occasions , but powder was more usual . Of the accessories of dress , fichus were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely . Long gloves to the elbow in light colours were universally worn or carried outdoors . In cold weather long furred cloaks and fur muffs were used and large fichus of black silk trimmed with frills of the same material , a very favourite form of wrap , were thrown  | over the shoulders and fell in full folds on the back , to the waist . The narrower ends were brought to the front and usually crossed . Other colours such as blue and claret were sometimes used . Riding coats were cut like those of men , some like coaching coats having three capes . Stockings were of silk and generally white . Shoes were of silk or kid , black or coloured . The kid was often perforated to show a coloured lining . The heels were of moderate height and had a very small base . They are extraordinarily uncomfortable to wear . Fans were carried both indoors and out . They were not nearly so well painted as in earlier days but are decorative in design , often having three ovals , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . They were printed on paper for everyday use , often having topical pictures or verses . Again one finds very little change in the standard wear of the farming class and country people generally . The caps were more often of the " mob " type for younger women , being seldom tied under the chin , and they wore large straw hats with coloured ribbons instead of the heavier felts ; otherwise the eighteenth century passed with most surprisingly little change in their clothes . Striped petticoats were  | usual and were made of woollen material but the time had not yet arrived when printed cottons were cheap enough for those who had to count the cost . i800 MEN So sudden and constant were the changes throughout the nineteenth century that in a small book like this it would be impossible to give any adequate idea of the costume of the period , so , with an account of what " everyone " was wearing in the last year of the eighteenth century this series of sketches comes to an end . For some years men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had marked the greater part of the eighteenth century , towards a simplicity and trimness which approximated to the modern ideal . The cutaway coat was double-breasted and was often worn buttoned . It had wrist length , narrow sleeves which were generally cuffless and showed only a glimpse of shirtband . The waistcoat was cut V-shape at the neck and was worn buttoned . Trousers of a kind were worn with boots for day wear . They were not , however , the tubular leg coverings which hang   approximately straight on the leg but were more like elongated breeches , fitting the kg closely . Breeches were still the correct thing for formal wear and , of course , have never been superseded for court use . The shirt was plain and showed very little . It was succeeded by the frilled shirt which led to the waistcoat again being unbuttoned . The tie of the cravat was difficult and important , it was high and many folded , the ends being simply knotted in front . Boots were much worn , both of the hunting " tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shoes without tongues but with buckles and rather low heels , or quite heel-less , were worn with knee breeches as a rule , though boots were sometimes used . The hair was cut short and left unpowdered. 1800 WOMEN Women were also striving for simplicity . By i800 tight lacing had entirely disappeared . Hoops had accompanied it into outer darkness and heavy silks and damasks had vanished . The gown was dead , or nearly so , and instead , a high waisted dress with narrow skirts which hung straight down from a waistline just below   the bust , the bodice being almost a minus quantity , was the almost universal wear . White muslin was the favourite fabric , sometimes embroidered with sprigs or painted with a pattern . The sleeves were either tight fitting down to the wrist , or short . The dress invariably fastened behind , having a runner at the neck and waist , and hooks down the back . A silken slip of white or some pale colour was worn under the dress , and apparently very-little else . The hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk loosely tied with a kind of studied negligence . Scarves , very wide and sometimes very long , were used as wraps and a short jacket rather of the Eton type in light or bright colours was worn for walking . But warm garments were reduced to a minimum and heavy risks of ill-health caused by insufficient clothing were run in the pursuit of fashion . Hats were little worn but smallish poke bonnets were popular and light gauze turbans . Shoes were very low and practically heelless . Black , white and red were the favourite colours . Stockings were white or pale flesh colour . Long gloves reaching above the elbow were worn on formal occasions .   These 1800 styles were by no means universally accepted . The adoption of them had a certain political significance and implied some degree of approval of Revolutionary ideas . Perhaps it would be more correct to say the non-acceptance of them showed a strongly conservative attitude .   DESIGNS AND DRAWINGS FOR STAGE COSTUMES THE general scheme of the stage decoration , including setting , lighting , costumes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody or be inspired by the producer 's general conception of the play of which they should ideally form a part . Some producers , however , have no power of visualising a suitable environment for the action and speech in which is embodied what is for them the only interest of the play . This of course throws the responsibility for the decor almost entirely on the stage designer , who in many cases also designs the dresses , though in the end the producer must decide whether the designs agree with his ideas . It may happen that the individual who undertakes to make drawings of the costumes for an amateur group has never done anything of the kind before ( although possibly he may be a very talented painter ) , and if so he may be at a loss how to begin the unaccustomed job .
