The First Baptist Church of Oakland , Calif , was all ready one night last week to extend a rousing welcome to a visitor from Japan , the No. i Christian of that land . Dr. Toyohiko Kagawa . The church folk of Los Angeles would gather the following night to greet the soft-faced , myopic 47-year-old man of God whose arrival has been heralded in church papers for months . Few days after Christmas the Young People 's Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , in Memphis , had on its program the name of the great Dr. Kagawa , who went to Princeton Theological Seminary ( 1914-15 ) and helped earn his way by serving as butler to Manhattan families . <P> Because he is an expert on Japanese consumers ' , producers ' , credit and medical cooperatives , a seminar on Consumers ' Cooperation , sponsored by the Federal Council of Churches and to be held in Indianapolis over New Year 's , was planned with Dr. Kagawa as its featured member . <P> The Fourth Southwide Southern Baptist Training Conference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other Southern and Eastern cities had him down for addresses before he was to appear , early in February , at another co-operative meeting in Kansas City . The Illinois Council of Religious Education was listed for a speech by the convert Christian who has written more than 50 books , many of them Japanese best sellers . <P> For March sponsors of the hardworking , ascetic-living Japanese put him down for meetings in Ohio , Indiana . Michigan and the Southwest , promised Colgate-Rochester Theological Seminary that in mid-April Dr. Kagawa would deliver its annual Rauschenbusch Lectures . After that the East and Canada were to have him until June , when he planned to sail for Europe and the World Sunday School Convention at Oslo . <P> For a few tense days last week the church folk of Oakland . Los Angeles and 88 other cities on Toyohiko Kagawa 's itinerary were in a frenzy of alarmed excitement . As the result of heavy weather the Chichibu Maru with Dr. Kagawa aboard was half a day late reaching San Francisco . Churchmen of the San Francisco area gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams greeting the guest of honor who was not there . Next morning when the steamship was finally berthed . Dr. Kagawa did not walk down the gangplank and a frantic churchman telegraphed Secretary of Labor Perkins : " EARNESTLY IMPLORE YOU TELEPHONE ANGEL ISLAND EXPEDITING DR KAGAWA 'S EYE EXAMINATION . " <P> At the U. S. Quarantine Station on Angel Island two Public Health Service doctors confirmed what immigration officials had suspected and what Dr. Kagawa 's friends have known for years : he suffers from trachoma . He contracted this highly infectious eye disease during the 14 years he voluntarily spent in the filthiest slums of Kobe , laying a solid foundation for his views as a Christian radical . After 13 operations , Dr. Kagawa has lost the sight of one eye , must use a powerful magnifying glass to read with the other . <P> Refused entry into the U. S. , Dr. Kagawa tranquilly remarked : " There is an American heaven and an American hell , and I want to see them both . ... I hope I shall be permitted to enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
