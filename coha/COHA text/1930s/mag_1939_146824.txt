As a general rule , a tough barroom bouncer figures to hang a shanty on the most rambunctious college guy . After the brawly bouncing around that occurred last week in Philadelphia 's Municipal Stadium , the rule still stood . <P> Boxer Lou Nova , who spent three years at the California College of Agriculture , is a serious sort , reads books , diets , sleeps long , goes for some queer fangles in fighting . For the Baer fight , for example , he trained at the yoga roost of Dr. Pierre Bernard , the Omnipotent Oom of the Sunday supplements . Half an hour before the fight his handlers came into his dressing room , found him standing on his head-relaxing , he said . Thus relaxed , he handed Max quite a pasting . But Tony Galento , the Orange , N. J. , barman , is most relaxed with a bung-starter in his hairy paw . For a week before last week 's fight he smoked a dozen big black cheroots a day , drank two or three beers after workouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange and saw to it that he got some sober rest . <P> When the men came into the ring , the odds were 3-1 on Nova . But what went on after the opening bell made mugs of many an expert-John Kieran , Hype Igoe , Jack Dempsey , Jim Braddock , Tommy Loughran . Not since the day of Elbows McFadden had fight fans seen such a bar-roomy brawl . In the first round Tony butted and backhanded . In the next , he wrestled and elbowed . Then Nova , whom the trade calls a get-even fighter , forgot his boxing orders and set out to get even . From then on he never had a chance . Tony butted , gouged , rabbit-punched , hit high &; low , dropped Lou with two lefts and an airplane spin , dropped him again and bounced on him , thumbed Lou 's badly cut right eye and heeled it with his glove lacing , swung so hard with his murderous left that his pants almost fell off . Finally , late in the 14th , with quartfuls of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Tony &; Lou , Referee George Blake stopped it , with Galento leading by all the tricks abjured by the Marquis of Queensberry rulebook . Nova , downed five times , was blinded by blood , rubber-legged , licked . <P> Tony Galento had won the goriest knockdown &; drag-out since the days of the last-century bully boys . <P> When it was over they carried Lou to a hospital with a good start on his first cauliflower ear . Tony went back to his New Jersey barroom , with his puffy eyes on Detroit and a great bully-boy future . Said he : " I 'll knock out dat bum Louis in two rounds . "
