txt Reductions in Federal , State and municipal expenditures , retrenchment in various branches of government , and the repeal of laws artificially raising the cost of public works or saddling mandatory expenditures on municipalities were demanded as necessary steps toward a revival of prosperity by business and professional leaders at a meeting held here yesterday under the auspices of the New York State Economic Council . Several hundred men and women present voted unanimously in favor of those proposals at a meeting at the home of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , 42 West Forty-fourth Street , at which George W. Wickersham , chairman of the council 's board , presided . The remedies were suggested in the form of a resolution offered by Thomas A. Wilson , president of the Marine-Midland Trust Company of Binghamton , and seconded by Elon R. Hooker , president of the Hooker Electrochemical Company of New York , after professional and business leaders , discussing present economic ills , had largely centred their attack on governmental extravagance . In his opening remarks Mr. Wickersham expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced budget . - Sees Ruin In Tax Law . Colonel Robert R. McCormick , publisher of The Chicago Tribune , went further and asserted that if that law remained on the statute books our civilization would fall like that of Rome . The resolution unanimously adopted by the meeting pointed out that " the country faces a great emergency , " that " unemployment is widespread " and " total taxes have increased enormously . " The preamble to the resolution suggested that it was likely we were spending too much in 1929 even for the enormous income of that year . " It is our conviction that one of the greatest obstacles to a revival of confidence and of private economic activity is this excessive public spending , " continued the resolution . " Necessary relief to unemployed persons must and should be given by government , to the extent that it can not otherwise be provided . But It should be economically and prudently administered and should terminate as soon as possible . " Therefore we believe that the earliest possible action should be taken : " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced national income . " Second  --  to reduce State expenditures at least to 1927 levels , a reduction of $75,000,000 , or about 25 per cent below 1931 . " Third  --  to reduce local expenditures generally at least to 1924 levels , a reduction roughly 25 per cent below 1931 . " These reductions must be accomplished by elimination of less necessary activities , by consolidation of bureaus and functions , by salary and wage reduction and by the elimination of waste generally . " Warns Against Delay . The resolution conceded that it would take time to accomplish the proposed economies , but warned that it " must not take too much time , " and that " retrenchment must come far faster than it has in he recent past , " Consequently the resolution approved of the council 's movement to organize the taxpayers by counties in this State just as the national council is organizing them by States . " Men with important interests and serious responsibilities in each county must become willing to give time and thought and action to the public need and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Democracy can not and will not succeed if intelligent people refuse to play a part . " Business has unquestionably made mistakes of judgment and sometimes of integrity . But under any system of which we have any experience , private business initiative remains the greatest hope of the people for the opportunity of employment . " Thus we approve : he organization of patriotic citizens in all legislative districts throughout the State , we pledge our support to the New York State Economic Council . and we commend the council 's program to citizens in other States . " In opening the meeting Mr. Wickersham said : " the American people are confronted with an unprecedented situation . Business is prostrate ; values ! of the most approved securities have faded into nothingness ; real estate , still valued at figures of boom times for the purposes of taxation , is appraised for purposes of mortgaging or renewing mortgages at much less ; everything is down , except taxes and public expenditures . " A few days ago , there was much rejoicing at the enactment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance the national budget . Whether it will do so or not is extremely doubtful . Certainly , if the present conditions of depressed industry , earnings reduced to almost minus quantities and widespread distress , shall continue during the next year . the tax bill will produce far less than is estimated . Wickersham Assails Congress . " But even in the face of that condition , Congress refuses to eliminate unnecessary spending of public funds and busies itself in devising means for disbursing large sums by way of alms , or to meet the demands of organized bodies of voters . " The Legislature of the State of New York before adjournment doubled the State income taxes for 1932 . The executive budget as proposed to the last Legislature was nearly if not quite the same as that for the previous year . It was $51 , - 000,000 more than the budget of 1930 . The Legislature cut out $21,000,000 of this , thus taking the first step toward reducing public expenditures . " Legislators , national and State , seem singularly blind to the fact that lavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of public economy substituted for the regime of spending , if we are to work out of the present depression " All recognize the fact that so long as men able and willing to work can not find employment they must be protected from want and starvation at puhli . expense . But the way to reduce unemployment and want is not primarily through dependence upon public aid . It is through revival of normal private industry . To reach that result the burden of unnecessary taxation must be lifted and the regulatory powers of government devoted to helping and not crippling individual endeavor . " Ex-Governor Smith , in a radio address on May 16 pointed out that the first duty of Congress , after exercising ordinarily good business Judgment . is to use every means at its command to reduce the cost of government . Governor White of Ohio recently told the people of New York , in the columns of THE Nsw YORK . TIMES , of how the State Government of Ohio had kept down expenses . " Throughout the nation , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary governmental expenditures . In towns , cities and States they are clamoring for economy in the administration of public affairs . Yet the law-makers are still singularly obtuse to that situation . " Mr. Wickersham then went on to show h , , w the State of New York was especially involved in the question of government economies , the cost of which had risen from $5.51 per capita in 1918 to $16.17 in 1930 . He explained that the New York State Economic Council had arranged with Ford . Bacon &; Davis , engineers . to undertake a study of one or two branches of the State Government under legislative direction , to determine what reduction might , be made in their expenditures without impairing essential public service . Depression Laid to Extravagance . Merwin K. Hart . president of the council , outlined the history of the movement and explained the organization 's program . He asserted that excessive public spending was " one of the causes of this whole depression , and that continuance of public spending on anywhere near the present scale was out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures in some aspects constituted a local question , and that public spending could be brought in hand . Grenville Clark , of the law firm of Root , Clark &; Buckner , outlined the national organization of the Economic Council by States. , After citing $928,000,000 provided by the veterans ' relief bill , which has passed the House and is expected to pass the Senate , he cited statistics showing how , relief for veterans , including those of the Civil War , had been pyramided until the expenditures for veterans now formed " a fantastic burden . " He asserted that $109,000,000 represented cash payments to the veterans of the Civil War and previous conflicts , including the Mexican War ; $119,000,000 went to Spanish War veterans and $700,699,000 went to the World War Veterans . Mr. Clark asserted that it had been estimated that $6,000,000,000 had been spent on World War veterans , and that if the relief system for that group of veterans expanded on the same scale that it had for other groups of veterans , it was estimated that by 1945 not less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War veterans . He said that he was convinced that a balancing of the budget would be altogether futile if the veterans ' relief resolution went through . Fred I Kent , a director of the Bankers Trust Company , characterized as unsound the payment of current governmental expenses by means of loans . He held that it was possible for government to be run on a normal and sound basis by proper planning and looking ahead . " There is no question that governments should not borrow for any purpose during times of high commodity prices and excessive profits . " asserted Mr. Kent , " as it inevitably leads to construction of abnormally high priced undertakings that must be paid for from the profits of the people upon an average of greatly reduced income . " It would only seem necessary to call attention to two sets of figures to show what civilized peoples have brought upon themselves in connection with government expenditures , namely , budgets and debts . " The budgets in 1930 of twenty-six nations amounted to $24,661,000,000 , not including States and municipalities , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry to the detriment of the I people . Rise in Government Loans . " The increase of governmental loans in the world is almost beyond comprehension . In 1913 the total indebtedness of eighteen countries amounted to $21,000,000,000 . In 1930 this had increased in those same eighteen countries to $101,000,000,000 . In this same year the total indebtedness of thirty-six of the principal countries of the world , including States and municipalities of the United States , was $140,000,000,000 . If the States and municipalities of all countries or the world were included it would , of course , be much more . " But this figure is startling enough to call attention to the fact that we are getting a top-heavy governmental debt situation that is excessive during periods of high commodity prices but that is a real menace during times of low prices and small profits . " Mr. Kent attacked the capital gain tax as a factor serving to increase the difficulties of the depression , as disastrous from the standpoint-of the government , harmful to those taxed and most unfortunate for the general public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , discussed the relation of the construction industry to the existing unemployment condition and attributed conditions largely to the five-day week . Mrs. Lillian Gilbreth spoke on the average woman 's relation to excessive public spending , asserted that ' 75 to 85 per cent of the country 's retail buying was done by women , consequently that it was important that such spending be done wisely . George W. Rossetter , president of the Chicago Association of Commerce , told of the recent organization of the National Organization to Reduce Public Expenditures , with a membership representing 648 organizations throughout the country . Andrew F. Kelly of Utica held . that It was largely " unearned wages that ruined us , " and he urged the necessity of having labor give adequate work for what it was paid .
