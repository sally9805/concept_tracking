Finding none open he returned home , fell Into a swoon and then telePhoned the Englewood police . The house had been ransacked and the suitcase was gone . The police were fumbling futilely for a clew and Olsen was vowing to drown himself In the lake when his ' wife , Agnes , lifted him from despair .
