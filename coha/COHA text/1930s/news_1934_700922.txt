txt The result of Monday 's offer of new United States Government bonds has been somewhat remarkable . In regard both to subscriptions elicited and to the resultant action of financial markets , the response was emphatic . The Treasury and proposed conversion of about $992,000,000 maturing 2y , per cent certificates into either 154 per cent short-term notes or 21/4 per cent four-and-a-half year bonds . Within two days virtually all of the higherrate maturing securities had been turned in for conversion . This was accompanied by the offer , for cash subscription , of $450,000,000 11J8 per cent short-term notes and $450,000,000 31/4 per cent eighteen-year bonds , and in the same space of time these were subscribed respectively seven and five times over . It should be remembered that in both operations the response meant that capital preferred the new government securities to cash , whether actually in hand or obtainable , in default of conversion , on the due-day of the maturing certificates . During the same two-day interval , prices for existing United States bonds rose on the Stock Exchange under heavy trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which with most of them was the highest of their history . Along with this interesting movement average prices of stocks advanced to the highest since July , with the largest daily business since that month . Average prices of company bonds went within 21/2 points of the highest of 1934 , which itself had not been matched since the middle of 1931 . Various implications will be attached , both to the result of the new United States bond offer and to the general market 's response . That the cash subscription means continued lowering of the interest charge on the public debt is manifest . This 4s a matter of high importance , in its bearing alike on future conversion of the existing higherrate Government bonds and on the question of what burden will be imposed on public finances by the mounting principal of the debt . But it also , as regards the question of possible paper inflation , reflects very strikingly the attitude of experienced capitalists and of the general public . The question has not involved the prospect , in case of such inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of such possible wild advance in prices of stocks , goods and living costs as should render the income from fixedrevenue securities altogether negligible to the holder . That consideration , which came to be of the greatest moment in Germany 's currency extravaganza of 1923 , has at times been made the text , by some observers , for judgment that all bonds are a dangerous investment , and that investors ought to put their money into stocks or , preferably , into commodities . The markets , as their action this week has shown , entertain no such view . Whereas transactions in stocks on the Exchange during the two past months were the smallest for the period since 1921 , transactions in bonds have nearly matched the highest record , and for the eleven completed months have surpassed , . vith the sole exception of 1922 , all previous precedent . This comparison proves nothing as to the subsequent action of stock values ; that will depend on many circumstances . What it does prove unmistakably is the belief of the financial community that the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
