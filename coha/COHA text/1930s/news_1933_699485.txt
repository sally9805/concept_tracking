txt Months have been spent in preparations in India and England for the flight over Mount Everest . The climb of the first plane , piloted by Lord CLYDESDALE , with an observer , from the southern base , a tract unexplored , will take only a very few hours . A second plane , piloted by Lieutenant MCINTYRE , with a cinematographer , will follow to the summit . The Houston expedition , so called in honor of the patroness , Lady HOUSTON , will leave England this month . In public interest , attainment of the top of the mountain , as an eagle would fly over it , comes first . But all that great bastion known as the southern face , which neither geologist nor naturalist has climbed , is to be photographed and surveyed if it is humanly possible . Nowadays there must be a practical side to adventure . Everest on the south presents too many difficulties to the alpinist to warrant an expedition . It is the opportunity of the aviator . He may fly from Nepal territory . The Maharajah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has always been jealously guarded . The base for the expedition will be Purnea , south of Nepal and 250 miles north of Calcutta . The Nepal border is 40 miles distant . In an article in The London Times Lord PEEL , formerly Secretary of State for India and who is chairman of the Everest Flight Committee , writes about the difficulties and perils of the enterprise in plain English . There is no attempt to make light of the hazard , or to disguise the fact that the adventurers will be completely ignorant of the weather conditions . The airplanes , specially designed for the flight to the roof of Asia , will carry heavy Iowa 's : observer , pilot , electrical-heating gear , oxygen cylinders , cinematograph and survey cameras , clothing and food . Observers and pilots will have work to do that would tax their strength if they did not have to depend upon oxygen apparatus of pipes , pressure gauges , regulators , flow-meters and face masks . That is to say , they will have to think of the scientific demands upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have trained in a sealed chamber of the Royal Aircraft Establishment , but absorbing oxygen lin such a protected place , with assistance within call , may be a comfortable experience compared with the searching test high up on the front of Everest , where , if anything goes wrong , disaster may befall them . Both planes have been taken up , with oxygen equipment , in England to altitudes exceeding 24,000 feet and have satisfied all tests . " The only safeguard , " says Lord PEEL , " lies in the phys " ical fitness of the men them " selves and in the youthful " strength and elasticity of their " artery walls . " He adds : " No " meteorological expert can fore " tell what turmoils and currents " of air will be encountered . " If adequate preparation is an assurance of success , the daring adventurers should know no such word as fail . The development of Central Asia , with its vast mountain ranges and far-stretching jungles , must be accomplished by air transportation . And so a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trail in the higher altitudes toward the opening up of now inaccessible regions .
