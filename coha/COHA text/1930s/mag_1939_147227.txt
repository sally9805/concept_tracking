One damp afternoon last week , just nine days after the U. S. submarine Squalus settled to the ocean floor off New Hampshire 's Isles of Shoals , the British submarine Thetis ( rhymes with lettuce ) * nosed down the Mersey from Birkenhead into Liverpool Bay . Like the Squalus she was a brand-new vessel , and this was to be a final diving test run before she was turned over to the Royal Navy . Aboard was an unusually large company-103 men . Besides her regular crew of 53 there were civilian technicians , civilian Admiralty officials , a local river pilot and two waiters brought out from a Liverpool catering establishment to help feed the added group . The waiters had each been asked if they minded taking a dive . Both said they did not . Neither the two waiters nor 97 of the rest came out of the Thetis alive . <P> Three hours after she had submerged , the Thetis was nowhere to be seen and her accompanying tug , which had lost contact with her , wirelessed ashore : " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew began to gather at the Birkenhead shipyards of Cammell Laird &; Co. , Ltd. , builders of the Thetis . A flotilla of salvage ships , warships , tugs and submarines set out from ports from Birkenhead all the way round the bottom of England to Portsmouth . Royal Air Force planes soared the skies . All were looking for the telltale buoys which distressed submarines try to send to the surface to show where they are . ( A buoy located the Squalus . ) The crowd around the shipyards grew bigger . After 15 hours the first news came ashore . Fourteen miles off Great Ormes Head , Wales , the destroyer Brazen had spotted something in the sea . It was not a buoy but part of the Thetis herself-her tail , sticking in the air like a diving porpoise . <P> The Brazen lowered boats . When her wireless operators tapped out messages on the protruding stern they thought they got back reassuring messages from within . The Admiralty released its first statement : " There is nothing to indicate that the men are other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene , a masked man had bobbed up from the depths-the first to escape from the foundered submarine . He wore a Davis lung , a contraption resembling the U. S. Momsen lung , consisting of a life belt , an oxygen container , a breathing tube , a nose clip . Half-drowned , he was Captain H. P. K. Oram , commander of the Fifth Submarine flotilla but not of the Thetis . Before he knew that help was at hand he had volunteered to take his chances getting out of the dangerously tilted escape chamber . He and six others , with messages of the submarine 's plight strapped to their wrists , were to act as human marker buoys , dead or alive . Of the seven , only Captain Oram and three others reached the surface . He was surprised to find the Brazen standing by . That news was also flashed ashore .
