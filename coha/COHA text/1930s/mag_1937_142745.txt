Since short-tempered Senate President Arturo Illas Hourritinier caned his job-seeking old uncle 's head and then tried to punish the Havana press for reporting the incident , an irate band of his colleagues have been staying away from the Senate Chamber to forestall a quorum , force him to resign ( TIME , May 31 ) . Last week after considerable backtracking , President Illas did resign and the Senate went back to work . Elected as his successor , on the potent recommendation of Army Boss Fulgencio Batista , was Liberal Senator Lucilo de la Pena . Promptly Colonel Batista sent his mouthpiece President Federico Laredo Bru to Congress with a whopping $78,856,000 budget , $21,000,000 of which is reserved for Boss Batista 's Army . <P> The budget , explained old President Laredo Bru , will leave Cuba with a $9,400,000 deficit , necessitating new taxes . The President proposed a tax of 1 a gallon on exported molasses , to bring in $1,600,000 yearly , a 5% tax on the gross product of mines , a tax on sugar used by national industries . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , costing up to $200 on a transaction involving $50,000 , would yield another $1,000,000 , and a 5% tax on capital leaving the island $1,100,000 more . Biggest boost was suggested in the tax on resident foreigners , now $1.55 a head , which would be raised to $5 for laborers and $10 for businessmen , produce another $2,160,000 . Most of Cuba 's foreigners are Haitians and British West Indians , the most poverty-stricken of whom Boss Batista has been trying to repatriate . Since several of these provisions , especially the capital export tax , would conflict with the Cuban-U . S. reciprocity treaty of 1933 , the President would reserve the power to grant exemptions . <P> Before they heard this bad news , the Senate had been thrown into a turmoil when four days earlier the lower house passed the most sweeping amnesty bill in Cuba 's history . Under its provisions thousands of prisoners awaiting trial for political offenses and common crimes ranging from pocket-picking to murder , committed before May 20 , would be turned out of Cuba 's crowded jails . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even onetime ( 1925-33 ) President Gerardo ( " The Butcher " ) Machado , now in Montreal where his secretary announced he would be likely to stay . If this move was calculated to throw a scare into Boss Batista 's restive Congress it worked too well , for the Senators immediately forgot the budget to shriek that soon Havana would be full of dangerous scalawags and cutthroats , to say nothing of political enemies . <P> Only outright " gangsters and terrorists " were excluded from the bill . This provoked an ironical outburst from Representative Manuel Penabas and several other members of the anti-Batista bloc in the lower house , who claimed that they were being threatened by the Boss 's musclemen . Cried Representative Penabas : " We are armed for any eventuality . "
