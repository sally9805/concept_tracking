txt A hundred years ago Charles Goodyear literally cooked some rubber on a kitchen stove with sulphur . To any other man the charred mess in the pan might have announced merely another failure in the century-old effort to cure rubber  --  change its properties so that it would not become as sticky as tar in Summer or as hard as a board in Winter . But Goodyear noticed that some rubber , which had escaped excessive heat , had been perfectly cured . Then and there he decided that the correct temperature had to be determined and controlled . More experimenting taught him what he wanted to know . And now ? Some 32,000 uses of rubber have been listed . Four million persons are employed in the world 's rubber factories . About 52,700,000,000 is invested in rubber enterprises that did not exist in 1839 . No wonder that Ohio 's 122 rubber factories are celebrating today the centenary of vulcanization at Akron and that the automobile industry is represented because it could not have sprung into being without vulcanized pneumatic tires .

Only a man of his fanatic persistence would have floundered through thou'sands of experiments until at last something like instinct led him to the desired result . There was no other way a hundred years ago . Chemistry was not . the exact science it is today , and organic chemistry had hardly been born . For sixty years after Goodyear no great creative work improved the rubber-making process . Barly in the present century the need of systematic research became apparent , The professional chemist , assumed charge of the laboratory and , in a sense , - of the factory . His first triumph was the reduction of the time of vulcanization with his organic " accelerators " and a saving of millions annually . He tore rubber apart to discover how it was chemica/ly constructed . Why not duplicate it ? He never quite succeeded . Then a great light dawned on him . Must rubber be imitated so accurately that the artificial can not be told from the natural product ? Rubber is too versatile . It is waterproof , elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these properties in a doormat or an ink eraser ? But there are drawbacks too . Rubber can not resist sunshine , many chemicals , - oil . Off the chemist started On a new track . He would make not rubber but rubbers  --  rubbers that nature forgot , rubbers that industry ' needed : So he studied rubber as an arrangement of molecules and learned how to make new arrangements . And now he makes rubber-Iike substances out of coke , limestone and salt . You can fry eggs and boil coffee on a few of . these " rubbers . " Some of them will stand more wear and tear than steel . Others will resist acids , gasoline , time itself . From 65 cents to $1 a pound is the price of these substitutes  --  four and - five times that of crude plantation rubber . But they are more than worth what they cost . They succeed where rubber fails . Nor is the end yet in sight .

For this is indeed the synthetic age , with substitutes for natural rubber among the most striking syntheses.
