txt Following a series of important private discussions during which U. S. Ambassador-at-Large Norman H. Davis talked at I e n g t h with M. Charles Spinasse , French Minister of Economy , and soon thereafter with British Foreign Minister , Anthony Eden , two developments have emerged today out of the exploratory efforts which have been notably stimulated here in the fields of possible economic and political appeasement since Mr. Davis ' arrival . First is the general agreement among the democratic group of nations to emphasize the continued existence of disarmament machinery by sending to the Geneva meeting of the steering committee of the Disarmament Conference May 6 a group of prominent statesmen . Mr. Eden expects to go for Britain . Premier Blum will attend for France if possible . If not he plans to send his Foreign Minister , M. " Yvon Delbos . Oslo Powers Active The Oslo Powers . which France hopes will act increasingly in the role of intermediary between the two general European groups , will be represented by Richard I. Sandler , Sweden 's Foreign Minister , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . Presumably this will involve the question of fuller exchange of information on armaments . Mr. Davis is understood to have decided definitely to attend the meeting in view of this general desire to give it prominence . The second is the disclosure that further efforts have been made the past week to persuade President Roosevelt through Mr. Davis to take the initiative in reviving the machinery for general European appeasement . Mr. Davis has been forced to make it quite clear again that President Roosevelt neither is able nor intends to take any maultn e other than to assuie his willingness to co-operate fully in any efforts to relieve trade from existing restrictions and to continua along the road to better monetary stability which was opened last fall by the tri-partite agi cement . No Early Developments Official quaitcrs make clear , and are borne out by all outside indications , that while the discussions are now progressing more constructively than for some time , nothing startling or dramatic can be expected in the near future . The British Imperial Conference , scheduled to follow the coronation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific moves either in the field of an Anglo-American trade agreement , or any change of attitude in the general European situation . At the same time it is strongly desired in British circles to thresh out problems with the United States now , so that the Imperial Conference decisions will not stand in the way of a subsequent Anglo-American agreement . As to the Geneva meeting , its purpose is solely to keep before the public eye the fact that machinery for appeasement continues to exist . Strain on Fascist States Another important factor behind the scenes is the apparent conviction in France , and to some extent also in England . that the pressure of the British and French rearmament programs is putting a set ere strain on the financial resources of Italy and Germany . which would begin to tell perhaps in three or four months The tendency . therefore . is to hold off on any specific movement until this effect has begun to show . Meantime the French are particularly anxious to keep the discussions alive here , presumably because of the impression it gives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other if nothing more . These two factors have unquestionably blasted any hopes which may have attended the departure of Mr. Davis from Washington that early developments might be expected on his arrival here . The only concrete result so far has been a , revival of widespread discussion on the subject of appeasement and the intensification of explorations in official circles . M. Spinasse of France has been doing the same thing here during the past week as Mr. Davis . He is returning to Paris over the weekend . but will be here again next week . The discussions will continue with the object to lay the ground-work both for the Geneva session and for the possible general move following the Imperial Conference . But developments are likely to be inconspicuous during the next three weeks . France is however admittedly in the forefront of the latest effort to persuade President Roosevelt to take the leading step . The assumption in French quarters that the United States is still sufficiently uncommitted in European alignments to be able to make some move . However this view is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately regarding the merits of democracy to make him scarcely beloved in Germany . Symptomatic have been several minor incidents here during the week . Efforts to bring together Mr. Davis and . the Reich 's Ambassador . Joachim von Ribbentrop . were not successful . American representatives here definitely do not look upon themselves as a potential intermediary between European groups . While the general situation is thus still in the formative stage , progress is being made in some special fields It is now predicted in informed quarters that Germany and Russia will sign special naval treaties with Britain within two or three weeks . Immediately thereafter both Britain and France will ratify the general naval treaty so far ratified only cv the United States . Reports grow that the British Cabinet is increasingly interested in the prospect of a trade agreement with the United States . The President of the Btitish Board of Trade . Mr. Walter Runciman , is supposed to have changed his position . The question of Anglo-American naval parity is due for further consideration soon .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
