Charles Wheeler Ervin , 73-year-old public relations adviser to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America , looks back with nostalgia on the years when he was editor of the Socialist New York Call , from 1916 until 1922 . He likes to thumb through old files of the Call , reread Eugene Debs 's daily letters from prison , smile at advertisements announcing John and Lionel Barrymore in The Jest , cluck his tongue appreciatively at some of the best news reporting of another troubled era . <P> Last week he came upon something beyond clucking or smiling over-a disturbingly prophetic cartoon . Published in 1919 , it showed Wilson , Clemenceau , Lloyd George and Orlando leaving the Peace Conference , the treaty on the floor , a child labeled " 1940 Class " standing with head bowed behind a pillar . Caption : THE TIGER : " Curious ! I seem to hear a child weeping ! " <P> The Call had reprinted the cartoon from the London Daily Herald , for whom it was drawn by Australian-born William Henry Dyson . Will Dyson had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Lansbury took him on the Herald at $25 a week in 1912 . In the great days of the Herald his savage satires on British complacency won him fame if not money ; his " Sentenced to Life " and " The Vampire " were reprinted far &; wide . Opposed to the War , he nevertheless refused to attack England while it lasted . A year of frontline duty and two-wounds deepened his cynicism ; in 1920 he abandoned England and returned to Australia . Ten years later he exhibited a series of brilliantly bitter etchings in Manhattan ( TIME , May 4 , 1931 ) . Last year he died , a bit too soon to boast of his prophetic vision .
