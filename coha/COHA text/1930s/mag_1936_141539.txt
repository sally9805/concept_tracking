An oldtime Broadway producer is 73-year-old William Augustin Brady , father of Actress Alice Brady , husband of Actress Grace George . In a Saturday Evening Post reminiscence last spring , Mr. Brady remarked , apropos topical productions : " A showman often has to stick pretty close to the news to get the most out of his public . " While summering at Lakewood , Maine , Showman Brady has lately been sticking close to the financial news-so close that last week he was in it . On this occasion he was concerned with getting the most out of his stock rather than his public . <P> To the common stockholders ' committee of Philadelphia 's great Baldwin Locomotive Works Showman Brady sent a letter on behalf of " William A. Brady &; Brady Enterprises , " refusing assent to the re-organization plan for which , since last spring , Baldwin has been soliciting stockholders ' approval . Owner of 2,300 shares of common ( currently worth $3.50 a share ) , Oldster Brady announced that his lawyers would ask the Philadelphia District Court for a rehearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he would alone . Brady 's objections to Baldwin 's plan were two : 1 ) it would " virtually wipe out common stockholders " ; 2 ) if reorganization had been necessary in 1935 , when the plan was sanctioned by a special master , it did not follow that reorganization was still necessary in 1936 . Mr. Brady 's second objection made particularly good sense in the light of recent business statistics . <P> Among the dozen or so big U. S. companies in the business of forging , casting , hammering , machining &; building out of wood , iron and steel the strong and powerful implements of railroading , Baldwin Locomotive has a big place . Of the three big U. S. makers of that essential giant , the locomotive , it is by far the oldest ( founded 1831 ) . In 1929 it outsold American Locomotive , its big competitor . But long before 1929 , Baldwin , in common with makers of cars , couplings , air brakes , signals and other railroad necessities , had felt the effects of the peculiar industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad equipment business varies as the square of the railroad business . When U. S. railroading lapsed into a quiet period of consolidation after the War , the business of equipping railroads became not merely quiet , but definitely dull . After 1929 it almost ceased to exist . <P> The classic Depression statistic is preserved by the railroad equipment industry ; in 1932 not one U. S. railroad ordered a single steam locomotive from any of the big three U. S. builders . Most of the equipment companies were well-heeled , and most of them , Baldwin included , had already started keeping a few eggs out of the railroad basket by diversifying products . They knew also that year by year more locomotives and rolling stock were becoming obsolete . They hoped for the day when Recovery would come to the railroads and the railroads , in a hurry , would come to them .
