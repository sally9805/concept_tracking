Last week Kentucky-reared Edwin Rogers Embree , president of the Julius Rosenwald Fund , went to University of Georgia to make a commencement speech on " How to Tell a College Graduate from the Birds and Fishes . " Mr. Embree recalled that when he was a boy the South had its own formula for the ideal man : a scholar , a gentleman and a judge of good whiskey . This triple ideal , said he , is still an admirable goal for education . Solomon , he reminded Georgia 's graduates , so pleased the Lord when he chose the gift of wisdom that he received riches also , 700 wives , 300 concubines , and " a prolonged visit from the most famous house guest of ancient history , the luscious and magnificent Queen of Sheba . " <P> Mr. Embree added that to be a judge of good whiskey " implies good taste all along the line . " Said he : " An educated man-a judge of good whiskey-will realize the abysmal gap between swinish drunkenness and that mellowness and expansion of personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift of the grape . " <P> Mr. Embree 's listeners were not amused when he told them the South had no university that approached the scholarly eminence of Harvard , Chicago , Columbia , California , Yale or any of a score of institutions in the North and West . They were shocked when brash Mr. Embree asserted that today the South is producing not only inferior scholars and gentlemen but indifferent judges of whiskey . Said he : " When the concepts of this phrase were widely realized in the lives of her sons , the South bristled with distinction . In so far as these ideals have fallen into desuetude , the South has drifted into mediocrity . This . . . section will regain eminence only as its leaders climb again to the triple peaks of this homely epigram. "
