Foresighted air transport operators regard the express business as their ace-in-the-hole . Passenger business is rarely profitable to any long-distance carrier . Airmail subsidies are subject to politics . Airmail loads vary inversely as the postage rates ( they are off 30% since the airmail stamp was upped to 8 ) . But air express has been zooming , will climb this year to 1,000,000 lb. , 66% higher than last year . <P> Into the game last week stepped a new player who , instead of saving up the express ace , played it as his first and only card . He was Philip Henry Philbin Jr. , youthful , debonair son of a Colorado hotelman , who learned the aviation business as a $1-a-year assistant to President Harris ( " Pop " ) Hanshue of Western Air Express , later headed Mid-Continent Air Express . Last week he announced Air Express Corp . ready to operate a daily 17 to 18-hr. service between New York and Los Angeles , exclusively for express . First flights : Dec. 12 . <P> Five sleek , silver-coated Lockheed Orions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Y. and United Airport , Burbank , Calif , last week , two more on their way from the factory . They are specially built , low-wing monoplanes , windowless , with retractable landing gear , designed to fly 170 m. p. h. with half-ton loads . The schedule westbound calls for take-off at 6 p. m. , arrival at 8:45 a. m . Eastbound , take-off 12:45 p.m. , arrive 8:45 a. m . <P> Only through consignments will be accepted . To save time checking cargo , the load compartment will be sealed at the takeoff , remain sealed during fuel stops at Columbus , St. Louis , Wichita ( where pilots change ) , Albuquerque , Seligman , Ariz , Among the pilots is famed Clyde Pangborn ( round-the-World , 1931 ) . Unbound by mail contracts or by required intermediate stops , the company may vary the planes ' routes at will to escape bad weather , also to thwart possible attempts at robbery . <P> Unlike the existing airlines , which delegate their ground handling to Postal Telegraph or Railway Express Agency , Air Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus insure full , permanent control of its business sources . <P> Air Express Corp . ' s transcontinental rate is $1.75 for the first pound , $1 per lb. additional . That closely approximates the air rates of Railway Express Agency since they were slashed 15% to 30% last fortnight . <P> If air transport were really a poker game , Player Philbin would need a substantial stack of blue chips to back his express ace . They have been supplied by " strong financial interests . " Three of the backers were learned last week : Chandler Hovey , socialite , yachtsman , senior partner in Kidder , Peabody &; Co . ( Wall Street investment house ) ; Arthur S. Jackson , of Jackson Bros. , Boesel &; Co . ( Chicago brokers ) ; and Frank Phillips , petroleum tycoon whose gas &; oil will fill the tanks of Air Express Corp . ' s ships . First aide to President Philbin is his vice president in charge of traffic . James G. Woolley , a plump , profane hurricane of energy who was a Western Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In charge of operations is Vice President Vance Breese , oldtime mail pilot , speed flyer .
