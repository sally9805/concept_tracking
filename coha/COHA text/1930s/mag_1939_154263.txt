Beer , champagne , tight abdominal belts , cotton earplugs soaked in a cocaine substitute , small doses of nitroglycerin , sodium nitrite , bromides , are all things that are recommended by travelers for seasickness . <P> None of them , however , affords certain relief , and the cause &; cure of seasickness remain one of medicine 's minor mysteries . <P> Last week as the British liner Lady Nelson docked in Boston , pier visitors were amazed to see a ship 's officer standing on deck , a large rubber muzzle covering his nose , a large rubber doughnut surrounding his mouth , a limp rubber bag hanging on his chest . It was Dr. Richmond Goulden , ship 's surgeon , who was modeling an oxygen mask for seasickness , invented by Dr. Walter Meredith Boothby of the Mayo Clinic . Dr. Boothby tried the new invention on four seasick passengers during the Lady Nelson 's 30-day trip to British Guiana and back . It gave complete relief to three , partial relief to a fourth . <P> The merciful mask is held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow tubes starting at each side of the nosepiece and curving clown to the chin , where they join a larger tube which runs to an oxygen bag connected with an oxygen tank . The mask permits a passenger to eat , talk and smoke while he inhales the soothing oxygen . The whole business , explained Dr. Boothby , is not as uncomfortable as it looks .
