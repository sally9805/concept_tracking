I HAD made my Paris debut with great success . " Yeti must follow it up quickly with a seeund concert , or lose what have gained , - everyone vouncried me . I could nut . I had no second program . It is terrible to meet a success for which one is not ready or ripe . It is an agony . Nothing can describe the feeling of an honest heart . Perhaps , had 1 been less conscientious , with smaller aspirations , I should have been satisfied . But at that moment I was terrified . I began to work immediately . There was no other way . The first program had taken eight months to prepare . I was three weeks working on I he second . Imagine what one could do in three weeks ! But I did the impossible . I prepared it somehow . It was not perfect academically , but 1 got it into shape . I met the challenge with my towering ambition and youth  --  and youth is a tremendous force . And then I played with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerto and Liszt 's Hungarian Fantasy . I earned some money . I lived as in u dream , a dream fulfilled beyond my most daring expeetations . I was invited to play at Brussels , then , and made quite a little success there . In fact , my playing was the sensation of the season , I think I may safely say . But I knew what I must do . I must return to Vienna and Lesehetizky , and prepare a large repertory at once . More Lessons in Vienna S 0 f %VENT hack to Vienna and began to prepare two programs , mostly by myself , for Lesehetizky was not there when I arrived , and when he came back he could riot give me as many lessons ati I wanted . But he did give me some , and the principal pieces I had to play in my programs I played to him , and he approved them . But I was already working more and more according to my own judgment and views . And there was always a little friction on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a real debut in Vienna in IS89 , and that was an immense , an immediate success , hailing me then as a star , and so on . After thud , my career as a pianist seemed launched . There was solid ground under my feet . I prepared two concertos then , and I also wrote my own concerto . had started writing that concerto in ' 88 . After the first season in Paris , 1 wrote it in a very short time . scored it in ' 89 in Paris , and wanted to play it myself ; but , alas , Madame Essipoff Lesehetizky said as she had introduced some of my compositions already in Vienna , she would like to do this concerto too . As Leschetizky had invited the great conductor , Hans Richter , to hear this composition , she was , naturally , anxious to play it . I must add here that Madame Essipuff was Lesehetizky 's wife at this moment . I say this advisedly , because- there were several Mesdames Leschetizky , all musical , all dimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours and tell you something about the importance of T ESCHETIZKY , who was alive 12 to everything of importance connected with the life of a musical student , realizing the prestige of having my concerto played in those concerts under Richter , invited him one Sunday to his house and asked me to play the concerto while Richter read the score . Well , Richter sat by the piano and read the ? 3COM while I played it in Leschetizky 's music room . The performance met with immediate success , for Richter said very flattering words , and asked me to play the concerto in one of his forthcoming concerts . But Madame Essipoff Leschetizky said , " Oh , I must . play that concerto . I have been studying it for several weeks and I claim the privilege of being the godmother of that work . " And then Lesehetizky took it up and insisted upun it too . Although Richter sug , gested my playing it myself , I really think lie would not have encouraged toe , an unknown pianist , and he probably felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . As a matter of Fact , I was glad to have her do it , because I had not studied the concerto sufficiently for a great public ' performance . It was really a good fortune , although I felt disappointed at the time . She was a line pianist and very successful . Her playing , many ways , was perfect , except when it came to strong , effective pieces ; then she was lacking in real force , as women pianists usually are . Quito different from IVIaditine Theresa Careno , who was a very  --  shall I say  --  strong pianist ; even too strong for a WU/111111 . Careno WiLS one of the pianists who had a very large tone , but it was not a beautiful tone , because beautiful toue must include tenderness , and she had none or that , just brilliance , Essipuff , on the contrary , was quite the opposite . She was very feminine in her playing , and small poetic pieces she could play admirably . ( Continued en Page 31 ) ( Continued from Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time a few days after Richter had read the score , and it had an immediate success . I am so sorry I can not find another word for that . Hans Richter had great faith in my compositions , as he proved by giving a masterly pert forniance of my symphony in London some years later . Richter was very much acclaimed wherever ho appeared , but he remained all through his life a modest accessible artist , and ready to assist a young musician in every way he could . He was not a linguist . The only language he used , and used very well indeed , was his mother tongue . In spite of his long career in England , where he used to spend several months every year , he never learned to speak correct English . There are many amusing stories based upon that defective English of his . I may be permitted to quote one of them which was very characteristic . He was invited once , for a week end , to a friend living some distance from London . His wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to London on the Sunday night . When arriving at the station he asked for two tickets , and said to the agent , " Please give me two tickets ; one for me to come back to London , and one for my wife not to come back . " You ask who were the great German conductors at the time . One of the most popular in Germany was Hans von Billow , who was extremely erratic in everything , including his career . His performances were sensational , but they were perfect in every way . One always thinks of his connection with Liszt and the effects of his marriage to Liszt 's daughter , Cosima . Cosima divorced Von Billow and married Wagner . And there the story begins . All this was of tremendous importance to musicians and brought about the great rupture between Liszt and Wagner , and has been the cause of much controversy and many explanations , which will go on as long as stories about Wagner are being written . Hans von low was very sarcastic , and sometimes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a quality which is always rather dangerous . He simply could not abstain from making witty remarks about people . Great Conductors QOMEONE said to Von 0 Billow , " Well , how do you like our English conductors ? " " What conductors ? " asked Von Billow . " Well , Sir Charles kin116 , for instance . " " Oh " ? with a shrug " he is quite good ; he is a good musician . " " Then , what do you think about X ? " " Oh , " Von Billow laughed . " He is a bus conductor ! " " Why ? " " Why ! " said Von Billow . " Because he is always behind ! " Great laughter . Prolonged laughter . Rather cruel , but , unfortunately , it contained a grain of truth which makes the point of the story . There were , besides Von Billow , other very important conductors in Germany . For instance , Schnell , who was at Dresden . Be was a man of genius ? remarkable , subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mottl , another great Wagnerian conductor . It was an age of great orchestras and great conductors . How different now ! You are right ; those men are tremendous powers in the musical life of the community . In America , for instance , certain conductors , like Theodore Thomas , were not only pioneers in symphonic music but musical conductors of the nation as well . They were builders of orchestras . Leopold Damroseh was another great pioneer . He formed the symphony orchestra in New York and also the Oratorio Society . Anton Seidl came later , and should be mentioned as a great conductor , but not as a pioneer . After that debut in Vienna  --  my real debut , as I always call it  --  I felt that my career had already begun , and I was fully prepared now to give three programs in Paris , the result of my final work with Leschetizky . So I returned to Paris at once . It was at the time of the exhibition in 1889 , and I was asked to give a concert at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the supreme satisfaction of being useful to my dear friend , Edward Kerntopf , because I encouraged him to send his own pianos to Paris for the exhibition , and I was fortunate enough to obtain a gold medal fur them . That was a very happy moment in my life . At last I could show him a little gratitude for all his goodness to me . I was then getting many engagements . My reputation was growing more and more . 1 played many times in Brussels , Liege , Antwerp , and so on , and in the provincial towns of France , all except Bordeaux , because Bordeaux is , perhaps , the most unmusical city in the whole world , and I do not hesitate at all to put this statement in my memoirs . The people are absolutely wooden . Yet it is one of the richest cities in France . From the sales of the famous wines , they are simply rolling in prosperity . It is very extraordinary . Lyons is musical . Nantes is musical , Nancy is musical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Lyons and Nantes , there are conservatories ; in Bordeaux there is nothing of the kind . The only attempt in Bordeaux , for example , for a musical season were three or four concerts which were very pompously called " philharmonic concerts . " They were ridiculous . In for the Duration I WAS engaged to play at one of these philharmonic 1 concerts , as they were ambitiously called . The program was practically endless . It began at eight o'clock , and we were all there at two in the morning . The orchestra played three or four numbers . A cellist played a concerto and a group of solos . A woman singer sang two long arias and a group of songs . A baritone sang two long arias and another group of songs . There were two groups of violin numbers and myself . I played one long concerto and two groups of solos . Who ever heard of such program ? Incredible ! The concert was well attended and attentively listened to for the first few hours , but when , about midnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , they found that they were unable to do so . " Why ? " you ask . Because the president of the society had locked all doors and put the keys into his own pocket . He did not wish anyone to miss one single note of that program . He managed everything in his own way , like a- general , including the artists as well as the program , for we , ton , were locked in . He was with its most or the evening , only going out occasionally to gaze at the audience from the wings , to see that all was well . We artists were all put together , as is the custom , in one room . The room was not big enough for such a company for that length of time . For each performer had his own accompanist . We were as endless in numbers as the program .

" You mean Quintain 's job ? " " I mean Quintain 's job . " Fuzzy considered . He closed his small , gray , twinkling eyes and tilted back his head . Then he bent forward across his desk and regarded Atterbury with a grin . " Maybe I could , " he said , " but I would n't . " " Why ? " " Because what I 'm doing suits me down to the heels , " he said . " And I 'm safe . " " But ? " " And the chances are , Mr Dodd , I could n't get away with it . It takes something . Quintain 's got something . Do n't kid yourself . He 's a big boy . I do n't know what he 's got , but there is n't any of it in my pocket . Maybe it 's art . Maybe it 's imagination .

" " Then I 'll tell you something . The company that 's going to make big dough has got to have a Quintain . He 's as necessary as film . But you 've got to be able to make him do his tricks for you without biting you . Know anything about politics ? " " Very little . " " Well , a good set of efficient crook politicians can run a town a sight better than a bevy of dumb , hcmest reformers . The crooks ' 11 get theirs , but they 'll give you a police force and a fire department and clean the streets .

" " That is why , after some study of the situation and of the personnel , I came to you , " said Atterbury . " Mr. Dodd , you are not the first banker who ever came to Hollywood . " - Probably not . " " During these years we 've had a pest . of them . Mostly they 've made idiots of themselves and got nowhere . When they come , Hollywood just puts on a raincoat and waits for the shower to end . It 's doing that with you . " " Waiting for me to fail and go home ? " The lady singer was accompanied by her husband , a jovial Frenchman , and I mention him because he played an amusing role in our comedy that evening . When , at last , everything was over , the president appeared in the artists ' room to congratulate us . He made the most cordial compliments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her his heartfelt thanks , " Yes . But meantime fixing it so that , if you turn out to be dangerous to their interests , you 'll go home with your tail between your legs . " " I 'm willing to accept advice , " said Atterbury . " Well , " said Fuzzy , " I 've been in this game a long time , I 've done pretty good by minding my own business , not getting too important , and keeping out of politics . Maybe I could have bought me a polo shirt , invented a new kind of temperament and turned out a great picture . But I had too much sense . I wanted to be solid . There 's a solid foundation under this picture game , and I wanted to be part of that . I have n't a house at Malibu . I never get invited to Pickfair .

" " Not exactly advice . Maybe a couple of observations . One is that Quintain is considerable of a genius . You may be a banking genius , but you could n't turn out a fourth-rate program picture . I do n't know what you 've found out , and I do n't want to . I 'm not even guessing . Quintain knows how to run this show . He 's a great executive . My notion is that this lot would collapse if he went out at the present moment . " " I follow you , but ? " " ' At the present moment , ' I said , " Mr. Dodd . Atterbury pondered that . Fuzzy 's opinion coincided with his own . His hands were tied for the time being . Perhaps Quintain was trying to wreck Colossal for his own benefit and for NI ; 99 .

" What , " he asked , " can you tell me about Mr. Nassau ? " " The door is shut , " said Fuzzy . " The walls are fairly thick . But I do n't mention that gentleman .

" " To mind my own business , " said Fuzzy , " and to turn out B pictures quick and cheap and passably good . " " At any rate , " Atterbury said , " that 's something . " He got up and moved toward the door . Fuzzy stared after him , seemed about to say something , but changed his mind . " Thank you for giving me so much time , " At terbury said .

" Cousin , " he repeated . " Cousin . I have never seen you before in my life , sir ! What do you mean ? " " Oh , well , " the other answered . " When one is obliged to remain so long together as we have done this evening , one naturally becomes a member of the family , and since we have been locked up all these hours I must , therefore , regard you now as a relative . " Among the musicians of the orchesstra  --  it was half amateur and half professional  --  there was a young fellow who came back to the artists ' room to speak to me . After a few compliments , Ire said , " I would like so much to see you again , Mr. Paderewski . Would you not be kind enough to dine with me tomorrow perhaps ? " " Tomorrow , " I answered . " Why , it is already tomorrow ! You mean to-day ! " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a Sunday and I had to remain in Bordeaux , so I accepted . Of course , it was a trap . He had invited many guests , and he really wanted me to play for them after the dinner . I noticed that the piano was open and a rather large number of people present , so I was quite cautious and ate very I little . I played , naturally ; there was no other way out of it , and that moment in my career I was only too glad to have an opportunity to play certain pieces of which I was not sure . To " try them on the dog , " as we say . Before I began , the young man was all smiles and said , " Oh , if you will only play for us today , if you will just play one solo , I will send you a fine barrel of wine in token of my gratitude . " Well , I played , as I have told you , not because he offered me the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was agreeable to me . He thanked me most profusely when I finished , and said , " You must leave me your address . You will get that wine very soon in token of my appreciation . The finest ' wine I can buy , I shall send you . " Need 1 add that I never got that barrel of wine ? There was another amusing incident in my artistic career in France . I was engaged to take part in a philharmonic concert . in Tours in 1890 . Tours is a charming place , but , you know , the number of people fond of real musical art is extremely small . They knew that I was rather a success in Paris , and that newspapers spoke very favorably about me , and so they thought it was absolutely indispensable for them to have me play there once at least .. It was a very nice fee , and I went to Tours . I always detested those miscellaneous concerts , because , you know , one is , so to say , charged with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that electricity works , it renews itself . But when one has to stop ; , , continually and wait for half an hour between numbers , one has to recharge oneself all over again , and sometimes it does not work at all . Where Top Notes Were Tops At this concert , first someone sang , and then I played . The audience was much pleased and I was glad . Then came a lady singer . Then came Galipaux . He was an actor of great talent , and very popular . He recited one of his amusing monologues , and he absolutely changed the atmosphere . It became then quite a different thing . Next came a tenor  --  a mediocre singer , but he had the most marvelous high notes . Those top notes of his sent his audience quite crazy with delight . It was in the very middle of the concert that ho produced those wonderful top notes that won all hearts . That was the end of the rest of us . He was the climax . I came after the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nocturne of Chopin . What a tedious tiring for that audience ! I played just as I usually played , not a bit worse  --  but no top notes , therefore , no applause ! They were bored ; they wanted more top notes . Then the lady singer came again  --  again groat success . She sang , I think , some coloratura , with many trills and cadenzas , and that sort of thing . Then , again , came Galipaux , the actor ; again a success ; and then the tenor  --  the tenor with the top notes . This time he was simply a furor . The audience went wild . So wild that when I appeared , right after his number , to play my last group of solos  --  well , this time nobody listened to me at all ; they simply began talking . I thanked God when it was finished . When the concert was over , other artists expressed to me their deep condolences that I was such a failure . I can assure you , it was very unpleasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman of the name of Mame , a charming man and the publisher of holy books . At Tours , there is that famous publishing house , Mame . He had real musical culture . He came to the artists ' room to speak to me . He was quite furious , expressed his deep apologies , and said he was disgusted with the behavior of the audience , who had proved themselves to be only a lot of barbarians . He was quite upset . He felt that the musical integrity of Tours was at stake . Ile could not understand , he said , why that wretched singer , who had a very bad voice and only a few top notes , had made such a sensation that the audience had not paid any attention to real art , and so on . Fast Learning , Faster Forgetting I suppose it was a little balm to my feelings at that moment . At any rate , it started a friendship that lasted for years . Yes , for years and years that dear good man came to every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ? And always , after each concert , he would hurry back to greet me , and his first words were always the same : " Well , my friend , this is a little different from Tours , is it not ? " These are two amusing stories to our credit . That is good measure . We must be serious again , and we now conic to a moment in my career  --  it was in ' 90 ? when I had to prepare on short notice , just out of gratitude , for my French colleague , a program of French composition exclusively . I had two concertos and some twelve short pieces . I mention this program of French composition which I had to learn so rapidly , because it illuminates an experience that will be useful to others . I learned these pieces in a fortnight , and played them well too . Technically well , I mean ; not a single slip ! But I was not sure of my memory , even ton minutes before the concert . It was an agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concertos especially  --  just before I went on to the platform . Up to the last minute , I was memorizing continuously . I pulled through my program to the satisfaction of the audience and of the composers who were present . I played several compositions by unknown composers . But here is the interesting part of my story and the reason for it . Three days later , I did not know one bit of it , and could not repeat one single piece . Not one ! It was gone . All this shows that nothing can be accomplished through one big SO THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 90 , 19a , effort of forced memory . I crammed and I stuffed myself literally like one of the famous Strasbourg geese ! Every student should realize that good and enduring , results are only obtainable through a series of small but continuous daily efforts , but a single effort is absolutely sterile . Knowledge , whether in science or in art , or in any human occupation , can be achieved only through daily toil and effort . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything accomplished without its co-operation . My life in Paris was one of the richest periods of my career  --  the beginning of toy real artist life . It is difficult to recapture , in a fleeting moment , the feelings of that time , and to recreate for you the mental and spiritual dimension I lived in . To tell the story of those days so long ago in which I must necessarily become the hero of the piece  --  of my difficulties and disappointments , my mistakes and hopes , and then the fun and the luck and the work  --  that is the task I set myself . I decided to make Paris my headquarters and took a small apartment in the Avenue Victor Hugo  --  a very modest one it was , but still , I had to get my roots , so to speak , into the ground . Just as the two little rooms in Vienna , it became a part of my life and , as in Vienna , I kept the Paris apartment for many years  --  until 1906 , in feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of my own  --  a world of work , of increasing work , a work that never stopped . And I know as absolutely today as I did then that I was always struggling for perfection , pushing on and on to that ever-receding , faraway peak of attainment . All work is like that . Immensities increase as we progress and the summit of the mountain is always farther and farther away . My greatest anxiety in those years was learning new programs and giving them to the audiences . My thoughts and my work became the only occupation of my heart and life . The career filled everything ; it was over and above everything . This building period , as I call it , hard as it was , was gloriously rich in other ways . It was then that I began to meet many people in all walks of life , important people , and through them I glimpsed another world . I knew all the great musicians of the hour . Their doors opened to me , and Charles Gounod was among the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appearance which gave you the impression of a high priest  --  stately , with a beautiful white beard , wonderfully expressive eyes , and with a facility of speech that was , perhaps , a little ecclesiastical : it times , because it was so unctuous ; every sentence was perfect whets he spoke ; a voice always harmonious and never excessive in intonation . Kind and benevolent in every way , a beautiful man really . Gounod as a Vocalist Now , there is something still little known about Gounod which is of great interest , I think . That was his singing at the piano . He sang French songs sometimes  --  quite often , in fact  --  at the house of the old Madame Marehesi , the renowned singing teacher , and it was supremely beautiful . He had a pour thin little voice , but he could do anything with that voice . He had a rare gift for singing . I used to go to his house very often . It was always a joy to me to be with him , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts and hear him applauding and shouting his approval . " Bravo ! Paderewski , bravo ! " He always came . loved him very much . The next greatest French musician after Gounod was Camille SaintSa , etis . He was an extraordinary mane because he knew so many things . He wrote philosophical books , even a book on astronomy . He was a member of the Institute of France . He was elected as a musician , but he used very often to go to sittings in any department --  to the department of archaeology , for instance , where he could read an interesting memorandum on that subject , or to the department of mathematics , where he would read something about astronomy .. There was at that time a singer of great . reputation and of marvelous baritone voice whose name was Faure . I once played in a concert when he sang . I noticed only one fault with him . He used to hold certain notes very long ; he would make a tremendous retard if they were beautiful and 0 hang on to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his admirers . SaInt  --  Sains the Unapproachable On one occasion , in the house of an aristocratic lady who gave fashionable musicales quite frequently , Charles Gounod was present , and Faure was about to sing certain songs of Gounod 's . The charming lady of the house suggested that , perhaps , it would please M. Gounud to accompany M. Faure himself . Would he ? " Oh , no , madame , " he replied quickly , " Why should I ? I can not sit down in every corner . " Gounod was not always easy of approach , as you see . Saint. - Satins was unfailingly kind to me . But it was a well-known fact that he was neither amiable nor accessible  --  al ways extremely difficult to approach  --  but I can only say that , to me , he was always kind and considerate . In ISM , I had finished the orchestration of my own concerto for piano . I was still lacking in experience . I had not even heard my orchestra music performed , and I wanted to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without further thought , I took my score and went directly to Saint-Satins . Though , personally , I already knew Saint-Satins , and he had heard my playing of his concerto , I realized that it was , perhaps , presumption on my part to go to him . I went to his house nevertheless . He opened the door himself . " Oh , Poderewski , it 's you . Come in , " he said . " Come in . What do you want ? " I realized that he was in a great hurry and irritable , probably writing something , as usual , and not wanting to be interrupted . " What can I do for you ? What do you want ? " " Oh , " I hesitated what to answer . I had come at the wrong moment . " I came to ask your opinion about my piano concerto , " I said very timidly. " 1 ?

" Perhaps  --  perhaps I may come another time , " I ventured , still hopeful . " Oh , " he cried , " another time may be worse than today ! I have no time , ever !

" " Arid I have the score for you also to read , " I said . He took the score and read it as I played . He listened very attentively . At the andante , he stopped me , saying , " What a delightful andante . Will you kindly repeat that ? " I repeated it . I felt greatly encouraged . He was really interested . Finally , he said , " There is nothing to be changed . You may play it whenever you like . It will please the people . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I assure you . " Another interesting musician whom I met in those early days in Paris was Massenet , a man of great talent , a great faculty for writing ; very successful and very rich too . I think he was the richest among French musicians . He liked to go , on the day of the performance of his opera , whether at the Grand Opera or at the Opera Comique , and personally inquire at the box office about the sale of the seats . " How are the tickets selling ? " he would ask . " Is the house sold out tonight ? " Even when he was ill , he would get up in the morning , read in the journal that his opera was to be performed that evening , and then off he would go to the box office . It was a little mania , of course . I think it was not wholly a financial interest . Ile really wanted to know how the public was feeling toward him . It was a mixture of feelings , like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young American soprano from California , Sibyl Sanderson , who made a great furor in Paris for a time . Thais became a real sensation of the Opera season later on through Mary Garden 's beautiful interpretation . I also knew Vincent d'Indy , who was a great musician . He was already , to a certain extent , under the influence of the new currents in German music . There was some little Wagnerian streak in his art . It was not an imitation ; he was just betraying that atmospheric influence . He was the first Frenchman who did , and it was , of course , long before the modern French music made its appearance  --  Debussy , Ravel , and so on . Chopin as Chopin Wanted It There were some salons in Paris where music was considered almost as a religion . Several ladies of the highest society played the piano themselves , and rather well . They were pupils of a . Madame Dubois , the last pupil of Chopin . Once when I was playing the Seventeenth Prelude of Chopin , Madame Dubois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in spite of playing everything else diminuendo  --  with great strength . He always struck that note in the same way and with the same strength ; he proclaimed it , because the idea of that prelude is based on the sound. of an old clock in the castle at midnight when it strikes the eleventh hour . Madame Dubois told me that I should not make that note diminuendo , as I intended , in accordance with the right hand , which plays diminuendo continually , because the clock knows no diminuendo . That bass note was the clock speaking . I have always played it since then as Chopin wanted it to be . Wagner was just becoming known , and his music had raised a terrible controversy . On the part of musicians there was little opposition . They soon began to bow their heads before Wagner , but the street , the people wore against Wagner . I do n't remember which opera , Lohengrin or Tristan , but there was a violent demonstration against the programs of Wagner in Paris ; it was bitterly opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of his attitude after the Franco-Prussian War , It was a burning topic . It was a time of great interest , and all these happenings and contacts made a new life for me in contrast and so different from Berlin and Vienna . French society at that time was particularly brilliant and the Paris world rich in musicians , sculptors , painters and poets . I entered into an atmosphere that surpassed anything I had imagined , even the imagination of youth . The great particular furor of that period was , of course , Sarah Bernhard t . I was playingin Budapest many years ago when she was performing there . The aristocracy organized a banquet in her honor . I think she would not have paid much attention to me then , but one of the gentlemen present. , a young Count C. , said , " Somebody must say a few words tonight , and I do not know anybody here who will have the courage to speak French before the Divine Sarah . " Then he turned to me  --  why I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very familiar with French , M. Patterewski . Perhaps you will say a few words for us . " So I made a little address . It pleased her very much , it seems , and she thanked me and asked me to come and see her in her home in Paris , which , unfortunately , I could never do , because always some engagement interfered . The Incomparable Bernhardt She was a marvelous actress , who made upon me the same impression as the great French orator , Jauras . There was the same lack of material strength . She had a very limited voice , in spite of her power . In moments of calm recitation , it was incomparable . When it was very dramatic , profoundly emotional , the voice became weak and harsh , even hoarse . She was unable to speak in a very loud tone . And so it was with Jamas . He was famous as an orator , and later was one of the most energetic defenders of Dreyfus . I heard him several times , always with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each time I said to myself , " Now I shall enjoy him tomorrow , when I call read his address in the newspaper . " Because there was so much thought , such co-ordination , such artistic climaxes in his speeches which his voice could not give . His voice and his gestures were absolutely inadequate to his emotion . He had power , though he completely lacked magnetism . But Bernhardt had enormous magnetism and most graceful gestures . Bernhardt was , in her way , like Sir Henry Irving . He , too , had that same poor voice , but he realized his short-comings and knew how to manage his voice so it never offended your ear . There was an aureole around his head whenever he appeared on the stage . He created quite a different atmosphere , no matter what part he played . There is a little episode that I recall at this moment in connection with my first season in Paris . It is rather amusing to look back upon , though painful at the time . I will offer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in May , I think , in 1889 , there appeared at my little apartment a gentleman  --  no , I will not give his name  --  who offered me a tour in Holland . I said it was too late , that the season was over in May . " Oh , never mind ; that does not ' matter , " he said . " We can still have a very successful tour , and here is my contract for you to look at . Read it and see whether the conditions are agreeable to you or not . " Well , I looked at the contract , and , as he said , there was a very acceptable fee , and also the obligation on the part of the gentleman to pay me on the evening of each performance , either after or before the concert . It was very clear . " But , " he said , " you must realize that Holland is a very peculiar country . A recital alone will not appeal to the public . They are especially fond of chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , it would be very advantageous to us all , " I had no objection to this , and said , ik " Well , that is your business . I accept either recitals or chamber-music concerts  --  whatever you wish and think best . But a group of my solos after playing chamber music from notes " ? which is very hard work ? " would be too fatiguing . There must be something to change the mood  --  a short piece for the violin or ' cello , or something like that . " The gentleman was quite agreeable to this and engaged a ' cellist and a violinist with whom I had frequently played in Paris . So we began our tour . On our way to Holland , we stopped at Rheims , and played in the circus there , because there was no hall avail- ! able . There was a very poor attend- ance ; first , because Rheims is a. small *place ; secondly , it was too late in the season ; and thirdly , because we played in a circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the envelope here with your fee , and I beg you to accept it now . " " Oh , " I replied , " this concert was too poor . I can not accept that fee . I must first look at the receipts . Have you got them ? " " No , not yet , " he answered . " You will have them tomorrow morning . " " Then tomorrow morning , " I said , " we will decide about my fee , because I never accept money which I have not earned . " That has been , throughout my whole career , a principle that I have never changed . At The Hague we played two concerts . They , too , were badly attended . A Post.Season Tour of Holland We went on to Utrecht . Again our concert was poorly attended , and so it was during the whole tour . I never received one single rupee for my work during all that tour . But that comes later in my story . The impresario provided the railway tickets  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to my services , was to provide the suppers  --  the suppers that took place every night after our unfortunate concerts . And let me add that suppers in Holland were rather expensive . It seems that because I had given the first supper at Rheims , I was expected to continue them all through the tour . Fortunately , I had left France with several thousand francs in my posses-skin , so I devoted this money entirely to that purpose . The final concert of this unfortunate trip was in a small place where only retired functionaries from the colonies lived . This concert was the poorest of the lot . Our impresario paid the accompanist , the ' cellist and the violinist , but to me he only said he would settle everything on our return to Paris . I did not believe it , of course , but there was nothing to do , as my name was advertised and I could not TIM away . And now for the grand finale . Directly the concert was over , a gentleman came to the artists ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , M. Paderewski , I am quite ashamed of this little place ; you have had such a poor attendance . But you must not blame us , because it is really too late in the season . Nobody could attract an audience now , no matter how brilliant . Su , only the impresario should be blamed  --  that he selected this time of the year for a concert tour . " He went on , " I feel it keenly , and so I beg you to forget this unfortunate experience , please , and accept my regards and compliments , and come to supper with me tonight , all of you , as my guests . We will have a fine supper together before you go . " Well , I hesitated . I did not know the kind gentleman , but . just at that moment the impresario came to me and said , " Oh , M. Paderewski , do accept this invitation . Why should you always treat us ? Let our good friend be our host tonight . He is a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us go . " Mine Host Entertains It was a very fine supper  --  in fact , it was the best of all the suppers we had during the tour  --  exquisite cooking , many choice wines , for which I did not care very much , but my companions liked immensely ; I only eared for a little champagne . During my entire career I have only had that preference for a little champagne after a concert . It was splendid . We ate and drank our fill , then he ordered expensive cigars . I do not smoke cigars , but all the members of the little troupe accepted with delight . And then came the liqueurs , which I did not touch . Then this kind and solicitous host bade us good night and went away after much handshaking and felicitation . The next morning we had to leave early for Paris . I looked at my bill and stood aghast . I was petrified . It was ten times more than my usual bill , and then I saw that every item of that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 , Vhat is this ? " I cried . " Why , this is a mistake ! I did not order this supper ; I was invited . " " No , " the clerk answered , " that is not a mistake . The gentleman who is vited you was the hotel proprietor , the owner . He was your host , " " He was my host ? but you pay for the ? supper . " There was nothing I could do but give him everything I had left . And so , on that high note , the tour came to an end . Upon arrival in Paris , the impresario said , " You understand , of course , M. Paderewski , that tomorrow I shall come early in the day and settle , in full , all your concert fees . " Then he smilingly extended his hand and we parted . I never saw him again , needless to say . Twenty years later , he published his memoirs . He quite forgot to speak about those sad experiences , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow and that he liked me very much . THE SRTURDAY Nothing of that kind has ever happened to me since . It was a good Lesson . And now to the next great step  --  my first visit to London . I had had three really successful seasons in Paris , and at this moment London was my goal . I want to say here that a London success would mean far more in a solid sense than any success in either Paris or Germany ; German opinion to the con wary . I announced three recitals in London at the old St. James 's Hall , in May , ISM I was then already sure of my pianistic equipment . Pianistic equipment means armor and weapons ; my experience was my armor , and teehni  --  al skill my weapons . I had a large experience then . I had already played the programs many times , and with a certain effect . So I approached London wit h conlidenee and a great eagerness and hope . I had as a part of my equipment , let me call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met before in Paris . But in spite of this , there were very few people at my first London recital . Although it . was a disappointment , still I could not expect more as one just starting his career there . How could it be different ? Then , the next day mule the newspapers . I was criticized frightfully . This attack was probably due to a certain extent to the very tactless advertising of my concert . Daniel Mayer , the manager , was very eager to make me , not only a great but an immediate success ; to attract at once a very large audience ; to make a sensation . And so he opened the season with the brilliant idea of advertising me as " Paderewski , the Lion of Paris ! " He plastered all London with the advertisement of the arrival of the Lion of Paris . It was his firm conviction that this inspiration on his part would attract the attention of all London . It did ! It made me ridiculous ! Changing a Lion 's Role In England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not please the English people . When I saw that awful advertisement , two days before my recital , I was deeply distressed . I knew it would have just the opposite effect from what was intended , and I immediately sent for Mayer and asked him to change it at . once  --  in fact , I demanded that he change it  --  and after much violent argument and great , agony , I succeeded . The last two advertisements of my concerts were without that additional attribute , may / say ? Mayer and I had happy relations for many years after , but we began our partnership rather disastrously . That ridiculous advertisement antagonized the London press even before I arrived . Quite a few of the newspapers spoke extremely badly about me , saying , " So this is the Lion of Paris ! Well , we shall soon hear him roar ! A Lion from Paris ! " And so they played upon the theme . I had then a tremendous head of hair , very reddish and very thick , so I displeased the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were bald  --  and further added to the annoyance of the advertisement . There WWI one exception , however  --  the critic of The Times . He wrote beautifully , but he did not agree with my playing of Schumann , of course , because he belonged to Madame Clara Schumann 's congregation . So my playing of Schumann was revolutionary for him , because he was accustomed to that modest EVENING POST and very restrained Schumann as performed by that . very old lady . It was a tradition , and I was destroying , or disturbing , that tradition . I played it exactly as Schumann wanted it played ; I mean not as to perfection . but as to dynamics of the composition . When it was fortissimo , I played fortissimo , which Madame Schumann , poor lady , could not produce . Therefore , in all these works I surprised the people , and audiences do not like surprises . But in spite of 1 these poor criticisms , my second concert was better attended . When the third came , it was extremely well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my Playing , and so it grew , continuously . Then I played with the Philharmonic and at various other concerts , and they gradually changed all around , except Mr. J. A. Fuller-Maitland , the critic of The Times , one of the greatest critics of the world and an excellent musician himself , a real artist . Whatever he wrote was jest . He criticized me sometimes , but . justly . Hewing to the Line I was Ikon offered  --  it was the slimmer season  --  a series of recitals in the provinces , and then came my little revenge , because a pamphlet was prepared by my manager to be posted to all music lovers in every place we were to visit . By then I was aware of pitfalls in advertising , so I asked to see the pamphlet . First there was a little biographical sketch ; then my compositions were mentioned and the critics quoted . You know how it is usually done by managers  --  a few good criti cisms , then a series of dots , then again a nice little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I read the pamphlet , and then said to my manager , " Now , this is quite wrong . It wo n't do at all . You must put it exactly as it was  --  ex-actly , " " But I can not , " Mayer cried , " I can not . It would he madness ! Hein ! " " Never mind . I am not going to cheat the public . You must put in , in full , every criticism that , was written about my playing . " Mayer became perfectly furious at this , for it was the most dreadful collection of criticisms . ' ' I wo n't do it ! " he cried . " I wo n't do it ! It 's ridiculous . " " Then I shall go to another agent . You must do it . " " But people wo n't come ! " he cried . " If they are intelligent , they will come , " I said . " They will say , ' How is it possible for an artist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Besides , you must . give them gradually all these improvements in the opinions . " It was , first of all , honest , and then , secondly , it was , too , a little revenge . Well , after much agony and arguing , it was done , and I must say it read horrihly . Mayer was still in despair when he brought it to me . " What artist , " he said , " who even pretends to give a concert conies with such dreadful recommendations ? We are ruined ! I repeat , ruined ! " However , in spite of his prophecies , the tour was a success from the start . Poor Mayer ! He was astonished when he saw that first provincial concert .. I think it was either Birmingham or Edinburgh , and the hall more than half full , For a first convert in the provinces , that was remarkable . By the end of the season the houses were full everywhere , and in London the same . S I played  --  in addition to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . because at that time it was work by which the most money was to he earned and it was also the fashion . In Paris , for instance , I had mostly private houses in the beginning . ? The London season left me with a greater security  --  security in myself and my art . I had , to a certain extent , conquered London . The audiences increased , the press was enthusiastic ; it was all growing and going forward . You ask me if it was at that time that Shaw was writing criticisms . I do not remember exactly as to that , but it . was during my first season in London that he wrote his very severe criticism in a weekly periodical . If , as you say , he is one of my greatest admirers now , I am thankful for that , but , at the same time , he was already writing unfavorable criticisms when the press and the public were of a different opinion . He could never be with the crowd . He wrote , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinottent of public opinion . That , I think , was more in accordance with his character , and he treated me , not only severely but .. I may say , ridiculously . These criticisms of the London press recall to my mind very vividly my first disastrous appearance in Berlin and the attitude of the press , and the consequences of that affair , which have gone through my lifetime , more or less . It was in that same year , 1890 , I think , that I played an extensive tour in Germany . I had already played in Germany the year before for a few eon-rests , but this other tour was much more extensive . I derived a great deal of satisfaction from all these concerts , not only on account of being well received but because the playing with dispense with a tie , lives , week in and , week out , in a pair of strangely ripened slacks and a sweat shirt displaying the autographs of past , present and future girls , and makes a musty superannu , ated sweater do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the class , room , this cheery disregard of costume : is so much the rule that the coed has learned to take it with a sweet smile . She gets peevish only when her escort grumbles about having to wear his tux L for a " formal . " Since she dotes on " floating " ? which means stepping out hi a long evening gown  --  she never quite understands why the other sex does n't take equal delight in having to squirm the studs into a dress shirt . Particularly in schools where men are relatively scarce or hard to snare for some other reason , the coed is too delighted to be dated at all to care about the way her date is dressed . A recent survey asked coeds how much difference dress made in their opinions of dates , and , although few of them had any actual objection to carefulness in dress , they mostly testified that it definitely took fourth place . The important things , in descending order , were the way a date danced , a reasonable degree of brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . Since Robert . Taylor is the coed 's current screen idol , it stands to reason that she may have a secret hankering after males who are aware that shirt collars will button and that clothes are often sold with trousers , those German orchestras was highly satisfactory . Of course , at that lime I had not yet the reputation to attract large audiences , and my concerts were given in smaller hulls ; but they were well attended and there was a great deal of enthusiasm , which I felt to be genuine . My musical world was growing . My appearances before German audiences were always a source of great artistic satisfaction to me , excepting only Berlin . Before telling you about that , there is something f should like now to mention . I had gone to see Wolff , the famous agent in Berlin , the year before , in the autumn of 1889 . I realized then the necessity of having an agent for the Continent . This , you will remember , was before Daniel Mayer became my manager and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important in Europe , and so , on my way to Hamburg , I stopped in Berlin and asked Wolff to take the management of my concerts in Germany into his hands . And  --  well , ho flatly re-fused ! You will remember that this is the same Wolff who was Rubinstein 's manager and the man who so absolutely refused even to let me stand in the hall at Rubinstein 's last concert years before . Wolff had tremendous influence in the concert field in Europe at that time and his refusal to accept me was a great blow . I was beginning to learn that the part of a pianist , particularly when he is blazing a trail , is beset with difficulties , to put it mildly . How true I found this to be in the Berlin concert .

But , when taking a quiet stroll along the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way a cravat is knotted  --  in fact , she does n't seem to care very much whether it 's there at all . Collegiate dress in coeducational schools goes in for the double standard with a vengeance . A girl at . Bryn Mawr or Vassar , Smith or Wellesley , even at Tulane , where Newcomb is a separate campus for women , will relax to her heart 's content in loopy skirts arid golf shoes . The moment classes become coeducational , however , up goes the black flag of competitive dressing  --  devastatingly smart sports outfits at the isolated school , suavely smart street clothes at big-city schools , where the girls ' half of the European history course will look like the shopping crowd on upper Fifth Avenue . U. C. L. A. coeds are famous for elaborate clothes , perhaps even more so than their sisters at Texas . Commentators from the vicinity of San Francisco say that is just like Los Angeles and let it go at that . But the real reason is that coeds tremendously outnumber men at U.

In a school with an oven division of the sexes , a girl does n't risk hair pulling if she speaks to a man who has come to a sorority house to collect his evening 's date . But in a school where coeds are in the majority , it 's
