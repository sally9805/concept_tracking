French war games staged last week brought 20,000 men into action and the U. S. staged maneuvers with about an equal number . Meanwhile , Adolf Hitler ordered to the swastika colors no less than 1,000,000 men , the most up-to-date , although far from the largest , army in Europe . This was mobilization-not necessarily for war-but definitely mobilization on a scale nearly comparable to the Imperial Russian mobilization of 1914 which Kaiser Wilhelm saw as a casus belli . <P> Far from making any secret last week of what they called " trial mobilization , " Nazi authorities in Berlin took no steps to hamper the sending out by correspondents of crisp , alarming details . <P> This was in contrast to zealous Nazi efforts a few months ago to keep secret their army 's preparations for marching into Austria . Last week , for the first time since the World War , Germany called up for maneuvers not only army units but also reservists-the newly trained classes of 1934 , 1935 and 1936 , plus units of the Landwehr , including men in their late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The German army magazine Deutsche Wehr ( " German Defense " ) pointed with pride to a " fundamental difference " between the army of the Fatherland and that of other European countries . In France during peace time , declared Deutsche Wehr , the typical army company unit of 170 men is not kept at full strength , but in Germany it is . In France the calling up of reservists is thus in its first stage simply a filling up of the army to its nominal full strength , but in Germany the calling of reservists means adding manpower to an army already full . The regular German Army , boasted Deutsche Wehr , is kept permanently ready " so that full company units can fan out from the garrisons at a moment 's call . " <P> During the great mobilization of last week , German citizens got scores of reminders that , as during the last war , their needs are still wholly subordinate , to the army 's . Workers about to set out on vacation tours or cruises of the Strength Through Joy organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Munich and in most German cities near the Eastern border , people waited on street corners for the motor busses which usually take them to work , then were told they had better walk , since the army had commandeered the busses . Even mail trucks of the German Post Office stopped delivering letters , began delivering soldiers , reservists and supplies . As men called to the colors left their jobs all over Germany , none knowing how soon he could return , German women were sent to fill many of the vacancies . <P> Quite apart from the immediate mobilization , the number of workers conscripted throughout Germany for rush work digging trenches , stringing barbed wire and erecting cement pillboxes every 150 yards along the Fatherland 's new " Siegfried Line " ( which faces part of the French " Maginot Line " ) rose last week to 300,000 . Road contractors in southern Germany were also busy on rush orders to improve the surfacing of roads leading to the Czechoslovak frontier " to withstand more heavy traffic .
