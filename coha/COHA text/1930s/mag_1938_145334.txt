Killed by automobiles on U. S. highways , last year were 39,500 people , some 2,000 more than the number of U. S. soldiers killed in action in the World War . This year 's safety campaign has thus far achieved a 21% saving in sudden death . Safest State has been Pennsylvania , with a 40% reduction ; least improved , Maine , by one percent . Right in step with the national trend is New York , 20% safer . Last week for New York motorists there came a payoff . Available for safe drivers were reductions of as much as 15% in basic automobile liability insurance rates . Lowest rate was for Class A motorists , those who in the first 21 months of the last two years had no accidents , or one involving only property damage . In Manhattan , where the annual premium for a basic policy covering $5,000 property damage and $5,000-$10,000 bodily injury liability has been $94.50 , the new schedules offered Class A motorists a saving of $14 , price of a good new tire .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
