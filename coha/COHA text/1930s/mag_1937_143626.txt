Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis Facie bat Anno 17- <P> Neatly pasted on the inside of an old violin newly discovered in somebody 's attic , many a musty label bearing such an inscription has caused hearts to beat faster . Most violins so discovered are fakes or " copies " made in Italy , Germany or Japan to retail at between $5 and $50 . Real " Strads , " violins made by Antonio Stradivari of Cremona , bring from $10,000 to $85,000 . There are only about 540 authentic known Strads in existence , 163 of which are owned in the U. S. , and when one of them changes hands the cat-eyed dealers and collectors of three continents record the event . <P> This week Manhattan music lovers gawped and gloated while more than $1,000,000 worth of Strads ( violins , violas , cellos : 20 instruments in all ) were played at a single Carnegie Hall concert . Noted Violinist Efrem Zimbalist played on his famed Lamoureux ( Strads , like Pullman cars , all have individual names ) . Listeners marveled at the mellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by the Musical Art Quartet and the Stradivarius . Quartet of New York , the small string orchestra over which senatorial Walter Damrosch waved a deliberate baton . The occasion for this Stradivarius display was the 200th anniversary of the death of Antonio Stradivari . Proceeds went to the recently founded Stradivarius Memorial Association , which helps make fine instruments available to talented young musicians . <P> Antonio Stradivari , whose life work today represents an estimated value of about $13,000,000 , was the finest violin maker in 17th and 18th-Century Cremona ( Italy ) , which was the violin-making capital of the world . He married twice , produced eleven children , waxed wealthy enough to buy wife No. 1 a splendid funeral , lived to be 93 , and kept on making finer &; finer violins up to the year of his death . Contemporaries described him as a long , spare figure of a man who spent virtually all of his waking hours at a workbench littered with the tools of his craft . <P> In his early twenties Stradivari was still an apprentice in the workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made fine violins . For some 20 years after he left the workshop , Stradivari continued to imitate Amati 's small , yellow-varnished models , then began to experiment with a style of his own . At the age of 56 , when most men begin to take things easier , Stradivari painstakingly evolved an entirely new model , broader and darker in color than the Amati . All his life he had been a feverish but carefully slow worker ; his later years showed no letdown . Though some of his last fiddles bear the marks of an old man 's failing eyesight and trembling hands , the instruments he produced after the age of 83 are especially prized . ( Violinists Kreisler , Zimbalist , Jacques Gordon , Heifetz own Strads of this period . ) <P> Violin makers , even chemists and acoustical engineers , have taken Stradivari 's instruments apart to see what makes them so good . One theory is that the unusually lustrous and transparent varnish Stradivari used had something to do with the Strad tone . But Antonio Stradivari 's secret , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are today , and what makes a Strad a Strad , nobody knows .
