 | " Ma'am , " said H.M. offhandedly , " do you believe Mr. Hume heard something bad against the accused that made him change his mind all of a sudden ? " Silence . " I do n't know . " " Still , though , " argued H.M. , " since my learned friend has sort of eased the question in , let 's deal with it . As he said , if Mr. Hume changed his mind , it must ' a ' been because he learned something from someone , must n't it ? " " I should certainly have thought so . " " Yes . And , conversely , if he had n't heard anything , he would n't have changed his mind ? " " I suppose not . No , certainly not . " " Now , ma'am , " pursued H.M. in the same argumentative way , " he seemed to be in the best of spirits on Friday evening , when he arranged for you and Dr. Hume to go to Sussex next day ? Hey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house that night ? " " No . " " Receive any visitors ? " " No . " " Did he get any letters , phone-calls , messages of any kind ? " " No . Oh , except Mary 's telephone-call in the evening . I answered the phone and talked to her for a minute or two ; and then he came to the phone ; but I do n't know what he said . " " And at breakfast next mornin ' , how many letters did he get ? " " Just that one , with Mary 's writing . "  | " Uh-huh . Consequently , if he heard anything against the accused , he must have heard it from his own daughter ? " There was a slight stir . Sir Walter Storm made as if to rise ; but instead fell to conferring with Huntley Lawton . " Well , I  --  I do n't know . How can I ? " " Still , it definitely was after readin ' that letter that he seemed to show his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " The whole thing seemed to start then and there ? " " From what I saw of it , I thought so . " " Yes . Now , ma'am , suppose I told you that in that letter there was n't one word about the accused except the fact that he was comin ' to town ? " The witness touched her glasses . " I do n't know what I am supposed to answer . " " Because I do tell you that , ma'am . We 've got that letter right here , and at the proper time we 're goin ' to produce it . So if I tell you there 's nothin ' in it about the accused except the bare fact that he meant to come to town , does it alter your view of Mr. Hume 's conduct ? " Without waiting for a reply H.M. sat down . He left a much-puzzled court . He had not upset , or tried to upset , one thing in the witness 's story ; but he left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected Mr. Lawton to re-examine ; but it was Sir Walter Storm who rose . " Call Herbert William Dyer . " Miss Jordan left the box , and Dyer stepped gravely into it . It was evident from the first that he would make a good and convincing witness , as he did . Dyer was a quiet man in the late fifties , his head covered with close-cut grayish hair ,  | his manner attentive . As though making concessions both to private life and to his employment , he wore a short black coat and striped trousers : instead of a wing collar , he had an ordinary stiff one with a dark tie . The man oozed respectability , without doing so offensively . As he passed between the jury-box and the solicitors ' table , I noticed that he made a grave sign of recognition which was neither a bow nor a nod to a light-haired young man who was sitting at the table . Dyer took the oath in a quite audible voice . He stood with his chin a little tilted up , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm 's heavy voice contrasted with the sharp and pushing tones of Huntley Lawton . " Your name is Herbert William Dyer , and you were for five and a half years in the service of Mr. Hume ? " " Yes , sir . " " Before that I understand that you were for eleven years in the employ of the late Lord Senlac , and at his death you were left a legacy for faithful service ? " " That is so , sir . " " During the War you served with the 14th Middlesex Rifles , and were awarded the D.C.M. in 1917 ? " " Yes , sir . " First of all he corroborated Miss Jordan 's story about the telephone-call to the accused . There was , he explained , a telephone-extension under the stairs at the rear of the hallway . He had been instructed to ring up the Pyrenees Garage to inquire about some repairs that were being done to Mr. Flume 's car , and to make sure the car would be ready for use that evening . At about 1.30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking on the other wire . The deceased had asked for Regent 0055 , had asked to speak to the  | prisoner , and a voice which Dyer could identify as the prisoner 's replied , " This is he speaking . " Making sure that the connection was established , Dyer had then replaced the receiver and gone down in the direction of the drawing-room . Passing the door , he had heard the rest of the conversation described by the first witness . He had also overheard the unfortunate soliloquy . " When did Mr. Hume next refer to this subject ? " " Almost as soon as he had finished telephoning . I went into the drawing-room , and he said , I am expecting a visitor at six o'clock this evening . He may give some trouble , for he is not to be trusted . ' " " What did you say to this ? " " I said , Yes , sir . ' " " And when was the next occasion on which you heard of it ? " " At about 5.15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hume called me into his study . " " Describe what happened . " " He was sitting at his desk , with a chess-board and pieces in front of him , working out a chess-problem . Without looking up from the board he told me to close and lock the shutters . I must have expressed surprise , without meaning to do so . He moved a piece on the board and replied , Do as I tell you ; do you think I want Fleming to see that young fool making trouble ? ' " " Was it his custom to explain to you the reasons for his orders ? " " Never , sir , " answered the witness emphatically . " I understand that the windows of Mr. Randolph Fleming 's dining-room face those of the study across a paved passage between the two houses ? "  | " That is so . " The Attorney-General made a sign . From under the witness-box there was produced the first of the two curious exhibits : the steel shutters themselves , fastened to the inside of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted them . They were constructed after the French style , like two small folding doors , except that there were no slits or openings in them ; and across the center ran a flat steel bar with a handle . They were hoisted up for the inspection of the witness and the jury . " We have here , " continued Sir Walter Storm imperturbably , " the pair of shutters from the window marked A in the plan . They were set up by Inspector Mottram under the direction of Mr. Dent of Messrs . Dent &; Sons , Cheapside , who fitted them to the windows originally . Will you tell me if that is one of the pair of shutters you locked on Saturday evening ? " Dyer inspected the exhibit carefully , and took his time . " Yes , sir , it is . " " Will you now lock the shutters as you did on Saturday evening ? " The bar , which was a little stiff , snapped into its socket with a bump and clang which had a grisly effect in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window was locked away with the movement of that bar . Behind us the girl in the leopard-skin coat whispered conver-sationally : " I say : they draw a bolt , do n't they , when the trap goes down on the gallows ? " Dyer pulled back the bar , satisfied . He dusted his hands again .  | " Outside these shutters , I believe , " the Attorney-General went on , " there were two sash-windows ? " " There were . " " Were these also locked on the inside ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well . Now tell my lord and the jury what occurred after you had locked the shutters . " " I went round to see that the room was in order . " " At this time did you observe on the wall over the mantelpiece the three arrows which were accustomed to hang there ? " " I did . " " Did the deceased say anything to you at this time ? " " Yes , sir . He asked me , still without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink on hand . I saw that there was a full decanter of whisky on the sideboard , a siphon of soda-water , and four glasses . " " Look at this decanter here , and tell me whether it is the same one you saw on the sideboard at about 5.15 on Saturday evening . " " It is the same one , " answered the witness . " I bought it myself , at Mr. Hume 's order , from Hartley 's in Regent Street . I believe it is a very expensive cut-glass decanter . " " Did he say anything else to you at this time ? " " He remarked that he was expecting Mr. Fleming there that night to play chess , and that we must always have a suitable amount to drink ready when Mr. Fleming came . I understood him to be speaking in the way of a joke . " " At ten minutes past six , then , you let the prisoner in at the front door ? " Dyer 's account of this substantiated the first witness 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner to Mr. Hurne 's study . They did not shake hands . Mr. Hume said to me , That is all ; you may go ; go and see whether the car is ready . ' I went out and closed the door . At that time Mr. Hume was sitting behind his desk , and the prisoner in a chair in front of it . I do not remember hearing anyone bolt the door after I had gone out . I was not exactly alarmed , but I was uneasy . Finally I went back and listened . " It is these shorn words of the courtroom which seem to me most powerful . We seemed to see Dyer standing in the little dark passage outside the door . There was not much light in the passage even by day , he explained . At one end of it there was a door giving on the paved brick way between this house and Mr. Fleming 's , and there had formerly been a glass panel in this door ; but Mr. Flume 's love of privacy had made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By night there was only the light from the main hall . Reduced to the form of a statement , Dyer 's testimony would have run like this : " I heard the prisoner say , ' I did not come here to kill anyone unless i becomes absolutely necessary . ' I heard little of what Mr. Hume said , because he usually spoke in a low tone . Presently Mr. Hume began talking rather sharply , but I could not make out his words . At the end of it he suddenly said , Man , what is wrong with you ? Have you gone mad ? ' Then there was a sound which I took to be the sound of a scuffle . I tapped on the door , and called out to ask if anything was wrong . Mr. Hume called out and told me to go away : he said he could deal with this . He spoke in a voice as though he were out of breath . " But he had told me to go and get the car , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my position . I put on my hat  | and overcoat , and went round to the Pyrenees Garage . It is about a three or four minutes ' walk . They had not quite finished repairing the car , and said they had told us they intended to be even longer . I tried to hurry back , but there was a mist and this impeded me in driving . When I got back it was about 6.32 by the grandfather clock . " In the turning of the little passage that goes back to the study , I met Miss Jordan . She said that they were fighting , and asked me to stop them . There is not much light in the hall . Miss Jordan fell over a big suitcase belonging to Dr. Spencer Hume ; and , when I said that it would be more sensible to fetch a policeman , she kicked at me . I think she was crying . " Then she went to get Mr. Fleming , at my suggestion , while I procured a poker . All three of us went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked , the prisoner opened the door . There is absolutely no doubt that up to this time the door had been bolted on the inside . " When the prisoner said , All right ; you had better come in , ' Mr. Fleming and I did so . I went at once to Mr. Hume , who was lying as he is in that photograph . The arrow you show me was protruding from his chest . I did not feel his heart , because I did not wish to get blood all over my hand ; but I felt his pulse , and he was dead . " There was no person hiding in the room . I went immediately and looked at the shutters , calling Mr. Fleming 's attention to them as I did so . The reason was that even then I could not associate a thing like this with a gentleman such as I had heard the prisoner to be . Both the shutters were still barred , and the windows locked behind them . " Other eyes , other opera-glasses . The Attorney-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Now , Dyer , when mention was made of bringing in the police , did the prisoner say anything ? " " He said , ' Yes , I suppose we had better get it over with : " " Did you make any comment on this ? " " Yes , sir . I know I should not have spoken , but I could not help myself . He was sitting in that chair with one leg thrown over the arm of the chair as though he owned it , and lighting a cigarette . I said , ' Are you made of stone ? ' " " What reply did he make to this ? " " He replied , ' Serves him right for drugging my whisky . ' " " What did you make of that ? " " I did not know what to make of it , sir . I looked over at the sideboard and said , ' What whisky ? ' He pointed his cigarette at me and said , ' Now listen . When I came in here he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a drug . It knocked me out and someone came in and killed him . This is a frame-up , and you know it . ' " " Did you go over and look at the sideboard ? " For the first time the witness put his hands on the rail of the box . " I did . The decanter of whisky was just as full as when I had left it , and the siphon of soda was also full : there was the little paper fastener still over the nozzle . The glasses gave no sign of being used . " " Did the accused exhibit any sign or symptom which led you to think he had been under the influence of a drug ? " Dyer frowned . " Well , sir , I can not say as to that . " He raised eyes of candor ; he violated the rules , he was instantly corrected for it , and he drove a long nail into the scaffold of James Answell . " But , " said Dyer , " I overheard your police-doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | IV " Either There Is a Window , or There Is n't " AT SHORTLY past one o'clock , when the court adjourned for lunch , Evelyn and I went downstairs gloomily . The Old Bailey , full of those shuffling echoes which are thrown back from marble or tile , was crowded . We got into the center of a crush converging at the head of the stairs to the Central Hall . I voiced a mutual view . " Though why the blazes we should feel so much prejudiced in his favor I do n't know , unless it 's because H.M. is defending him . Or unless it 's because he looks so absolutely right : that is , he looks as though he 'd lend you a tenner if you needed it , and stand by you if you got into trouble . The trouble is , they all look guilty in the dock . If they 're calm , it 's a bad sign . If they 're wild , it 's a still worse sign . This may be due to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty they probably would n't be in the dock at all . " " ' M , " said my wife , her face wearing that concentrated expression which betokens wild ideas . " I 've been thinking .. " " It 's inadvisable . " " Yes , I know . But do you know , Ken , while they were stringing out all that evidence , I kept thinking that nobody  | could possibly be as loony as that chap seems to be unless he were innocent . But then along came that business of his having taken no sleeping-drug at all . If they can prove that by medical evidence . . . well . . . unless H.M. will try to prove insanity after all . " What H.M. wished to prove was not apparent . He had subjected Dyer to a singularly long and singularly uninspired cross-examination , directed chiefly to proving that on the day of the murder Hume had been attempting to get in touch with Answell by telephone as early as nine o'clock in the morning . H.M. 's one good point concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even this was left enigmatic . H.M. called attention to the fact that half of the blue feather attached to it had been broken off . Was that feather intact when Dyer had seen the arrow on the wall before the crime ? Oh , yes . Sure ? Positive . But the piece of feather was missing when they discovered the body ? Yes . Did they find the other half anywhere in the room ? No ; they had searched as a matter of form , but they could not find it . H.M. 's last attack was still more obscure . Were the three arrows hung flat against the wall ? Not all of them , Dyer replied . The two arrows making the sides of the triangle lay flat on the wall ; but the base of it , crossing the other two , had been set out on steel staples about a quarter of an inch . " And all that , " Evelyn commented , " H.M. asked as quietly as a lamb . I tell you , Ken , it 's unnatural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own witness . I say , do you think we could see H.M. ? " " I doubt it . He 'll probably be having lunch at the Bar Mess . " At this point our attention was forcibly called . Who the  | man was ( whether he was someone attached to the courts or an outsider with a thirst for imparting information ) we never learned . With an effect like a Maskylene illusion , a little man thrust himself out of the crowd and tapped me on the shoulder . " Want to see two of the Ones in the Big Case ? " he asked in a whisper . " Just ahead of you ! That there on the right is Dr. Spencer Hume , and that there on the left is Reginald Answell , ' is cousin . They 're right amongst us , and they 'll ' ave to go downstairs together . Ss-t ! " Back went the head . By the convergence of the crowd on the big marble stairs , the two men he indicated were swept to a stiff march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too favorably . Dr. Hume was a middle-sized , rather tubby man with graying black hair parted and combed to such nicety on his round head that it gave the effect of a wheel . He turned his head sideways for a brief look ; we saw a nose radiating self-confidence , and a gravely pursed-up mouth . He carried , incongruously , a top-hat , which he was trying to prevent being squashed . His companion I recognized as the young man whom I had seen sitting at the solicitors ' table , and to whom Dyer had given a sign of recognition . He was a good type : lean , with a fine carriage of the shoulders and sharply defined jaws . The tailor had done well by him , and he was absently hitting the edge of his hand on a bowler hat . The two took a quick look at each other , and descended with that shuffle-fall which is the march of the Old Bailey . They decided to notice each other 's presence . I wondered whether the atmosphere would be hostile ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The atmosphere between them , palpable and sticky as glue , was hypocrisy .  | Reginald Answell spoke in that tone exclusively reserved for funerals . " How is Mary taking it ? " he inquired in a hoarse whisper . " Pretty badly , I 'm afraid , " said the doctor , shaking his head . " Too bad ! " " Yes , unfortunately . " They descended another step . " I did n't see her in court , " observed Reginald out of the side of his mouth . " Are they calling her as a witness ? " " The prosecution are n't , " said Dr. Hume in a curious tone . He looked sideways . " And I notice they 're not calling you ? " " Oh , no . I 'm not concerned in it . The defense are n't calling me either . I could n't do him any good . I only got to the house after he  --  you know , fainted . Poor old Jim . I thought he was made of stronger stuff than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . " " Believe me , I quite appreciate that , " murmured Dr. Hume , looking quickly over his shoulder ; " and I myself should have been only too willing to testify ? But there seems to be some doubt on the part of the Crown , and he himself , you know , says ? " He stopped . " No hard feelings ? " " No . Oh , no . There is insanity in the family , you know . " They descended nearly the whole flight . " Nothing much , of course . Only like a touch of the tar. ? brush a few generations back . I wonder what he 's eating ? " The doctor was sententious . " Ah , that 's difficult to say . I expect He 's drinking bitter beer alone , the Color-sergeant said . ' " " Why the hell , " asked the other quietly , " do you bring up the army ? "  | They stopped . " My dear fellow , it was only in a manner of speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer connected with the army , " Dr. Hume told him , with an air of concern . They stopped under the great rotunda and dim mural paintings of the Central hall ; Dr. Hume became gravely kind . " Now let 's face it . It 's a sad business . I 've lost a brother myself , you know . But there it is : the world must keep on , and men must work , and women must weep , as they say . So the most sensible thing to do is to get this unpleasant matter off our minds and forget it as soon as possible , eh ? Good-by , captain . I 'd better not be seen shaking hands with you ; it would n't look seemly , under the circumstances . " He bustled off . For they 've done with Danny Deever ; you can hear the Dead March play ; The regiment 's in column , and they 're marching them away There is something about the atmosphere of this place which impels people to moralize in just the way those lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment by the surprising and welcome spectacle of Lollypop , H.M. 's blonde secretary , pushing her way through the crowd towards us . Evelyn was beginning to say , " For God 's sake , let 's get out of here ? " with her very attractive face flushed , when she stopped . " Hooray ! " said Evelyn , expelling her breath . " It 's H.M. , " said Lollypop , rather unnecessarily . " He wants to see you . " " Where is he ? What 's he doing ? " " At the moment , " said Lollypop doubtfully , " I should  | think he was breaking furniture . That 's what he said he was going to do when I saw him last . But by the time you arrive I expect he 'll be eating his lunch . You 're to go to the Milton 's Head Tavern , Wood Street , Cheapside  --  just round the corner , it is . Oh , dear . " H.M. 's extensive knowledge of obscure eating-houses is due to his extensive knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more disreputable the better . The Milton 's Head , tucked up into a crazy little alley off Wood Street , looked as though it had not had its littlepaned windows cleaned since the Great Fire . There was now a great fire burning in the taproom against the raw March cold , and artificial geraniums in the windows emphasized that cold . We were directed upstairs to a private room , where H.M. sat behind an immense pewter tankard and a plate of lamb-chops . With a napkin tucked into his collar , he was chewing at the side of one lamb-chop in that fashion which popular film-tradition attributes to King Henry the Eighth . " Ar , " said H.M. , opening one eye . I waited , to see which way the mood would go . " Well , " growled H.M. , only half malevolently , " I suppose you 're not goin ' to keep that door open all day ? You want me to die of pneumonia ? " " In the past , " I said , " you 've got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it possible that you can get out of this one ? " H.M. put down the lamb-chop and opened his eyes wide . Over his wooden face crept an expression of amusement . " Ho ho , " he said . " So you think they 've got the old man licked already , hey ? " " Not necessarily . H.M. , is this fellow guilty ? "  | " No , " said H.M. " Can you prove it ? " " I du n no , son . I 'm goin ' to have a very good try . It depends on how much of my evidence they 'll admit . " There was no raising of defenses . The old man was worried , and almost showed it . " Who 's instructing you in the case ? " He rubbed his hand across his big bald head , and looked sour . " Solicitor ? There 's no solicitor . ) Y'see , I 'm the only feller who 'd believe him . I got a fancy for lame dogs , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , if you 're lookin ' for any dramatic lastminute eruption of the hidden witness bustin ' into court and causin ' a row , get it out of your heads . You 'd no more cause a row in Balmy Bodkin 's court than you 'd find one on a chess-board . It 's all goin ' to be on the table all the time ? and that 's how I want it . One quiet move to another . Like chess . Or maybe like hunting . You remember the way the lines swing in John Peel ? From a point to a check : from a check to a view : from a view to a kill in the morning . ' " l As a rule , counsel for the defense may appear at the Old Bailey only on instructions from a solicitor . But there are two exceptions to this : " legal aid " cases , and " clock briefs . " In legal aid cases , counsel is appointed by the judge for a prisoner having no money to employ it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock brief , " or docker " ; the accused has the right to be defended by any counsel , sitting in robes in court , whom he may select . In Answell 's case there was , of course , no question of a lack of money . But since Answell  --  as will appear  --  refused to have anything to do with anyone except H.M. , it became technically a dock brief . I am told that this procedure , though unconventional , is strictly legal . The ordinary dock brief is one of the best features of the impartial Central Criminal Court . Any counsel , however eminent , must serve if selected ; it is a point of honor that he must put his best efforts into the defense ; and his fee must be ?  | " Well , good luck to you . " " You could help , " roared H.M. suddenly , wishing to get this off his chest . " Help ? " " Now , shut up , dammit ! " insisted H.M. , before I could say anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you thrown into jail . All I want you to do is take a message , which wo n't compromise you any , to one of my witnesses . I ca n't do it myself ; and I 've got a suspicion of telephones since I 've heard what they 've done in this business . " " Which witness ? " " Mary Hume .... Here comes your soup , so eat and keep quiet . " The food was excellent . At the end of it H.M. 's tension had relaxed , and he was in such a ( comparative ) good humor that he had fallen to grousing again . There was a good fire in the dingy grate : H.M. , with his feet on the fender and a large cigar drawing well , broached the subject with a scowl . " I 'm not goin ' to discuss this business with anybody , " he said . " But if there 's anything about it you 'd like to know that wo n't concern what the defense knows or has had the gumption to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Evelyn . " Why on earth did you have to bring this business to court ? That is , of course , if you could show the police ? ? " " No , " said H.M. " That 's one of the questions you ca n't ask . " He sniffed , staring at the fire . " Well , then , " I suggested , " if you say Answell is n't the murderer , have you got any explanation of how the real murderer got in and out of the room ? " " Burn me , I should hope so , son ! Or what kind of a de-  | fense do you think I 'd have ? " asked H.M. plaintively . " Do you think I 'd be such an eternal blazin ' fathead as to go chargin ' in without an alternative explanation ? I say , it 's a funny thing about that , too . It was the girl herself  --  this Mary Hume  --  who put the idea into my head when I was dead stumped . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thinkin ' , and that did n't seem to do any good ; and then she mentioned that the one thing in prison Jim Answell hated most was the Judas window . And that tore it , you see . " " Did it ? What 's the Judas window ? Look here , you 're not going to say there was any hocus-pocus about those steel shutters and locked windows , are you ? " " No . " " What about the door , then ? Are they right in saying that the door really was bolted on the inside : and that it was a good solid door , so that the bolt could n't be and was n't tampered with in any way from the outside ? " " Sure . They 're quite right in sayin ' all that . " We all took a drink of beer . " I wo n't say it 's impossible , because you have been known to pull it off before . But if this is n't some kind of technical evasion ? ? " Some inner irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean exactly what I say . The door really was tight and solid and bolted ; and the windows really were tight and solid and bolted . Nobody monkeyed with a fastening to lock or unlock either . Also , you heard the architect say there was n't a chink or crevice or rat-hole in the walls anywhere ; also true . No , I 'm tellin ' you : the murderer got in and out through the Judas window . " Evelyn and I looked at each other . We both knew that H.M. was not merely making mysteries : he had discovered something new , and he turned it over and over in his mind  | with fascination . " The Judas window " had a sinister sound . It suggested all sorts of images without a definite one emerging . You seemed to see a shadowy figure peering in ; and that was all . " But damn it , " I said , " if all those circumstances are true , there ca n't be any such thing ! Either there is a window or there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some peculiar feature in the construction of the room , which the architect did n't spot ? ? " " No , son , that 's the rummy part of it . The room is just like any other room . You 've got a Judas window in your own room at home ; there 's one in this room , and there 's one in every courtroom in the Old Bailey . The trouble is that so few people ever notice it . " With some difficulty he hoisted himself to his feet . He went to the window , his cigar fuming , and scowled out at the clutter of roofs . " Now , now ? " continued H.M. soothingly . " We got work to do . Ken , I want you to take a letter to Mary Hume in Grosvenor Street . Just get an answer yes or no , and come back straightaway . I want you to hear the afternoon sittin ' , because they 're first going to put Randolph Fleming in the box , and I 've got some very searchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact is , if you follow very closely the testimony that has been given and will be given in court , you 'll see just where I went to get my witnesses , and why . " " Any instructions ? " H.M. took the cigar out of his mouth and contemplated it . " Well . . . now . Considerin ' that I do n't want you to get into any trouble , no . Just say you 're an associate of mine , and give the note I 'll write for you to Mary Hume . If the little gal wants to talk about the case , go right ahead and  | talk , because your knowledge is pretty limited . If anyone else tackles you about it , let your tongue rattle freely , and it would n't do any harm to spread an atmosphere of mysterious disquiet . But do n't mention the Judas window . " It was all I could get out of him . He called for paper and an envelope ; he scribbled a note at the table  --  and sealed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as facts , in those three words of the Judas window . When I went downstairs I had a confused idea of thousands of houses and millions of rooms , piled into the rabbit-warren of London : each respectable and lamp-lit in its long lines of streets : and yet each containing a Judas window which only a murderer could see .  | V " Not an Ogre 's Den " - THE taxi-driver who set me down before number i 2 Grosvenor Street eyed the house with interest . It was one of those narrow dun-colored places in whose windows there are nowadays many To Let signs , set up from the street inside a little paved patch of yard with an iron railing round it . A narrow paved passage separated it from the house on the left . I went up the steps to the vestibule , out of a raw wind that was raking Grosvenor Street at the turn of the afternoon . The trim little maid who answered the doorbell began to close the door before the words were out of my mouth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message from Sir Henry Mer-rivale ? " The maid darted away , and the door wavered . She had neither invited me in nor closed it on me , so I went inside . In the hall a great grandfather clock looked at you with a no-nonsense air , and seemed to rustle rather than tick . By an agitation of draperies on an arch to the left you could follow the maid 's flight . There was a slight throat-clearing inside , and Reginald Answell came out into the hall . Seeing him now face to face , an earlier impression was  | confirmed . His long-jawed and saturnine good-looks seemed to give him a darkish tinge which did not go well with his light hair . Under a long slope of forehead his eyes were a little sunken , but completely straightforward . Though subdued , he was not now bowed down by that thick humilitybefore-death he had shown on the stairs of the Old Bailey , and I judged that ordinarily he would be engaging enough . " You 're from Sir Henry Merrivale ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke with some intensity . " Look here , old chap : Miss Hume is  --  not very well . I 've just come round to see about it . I 'm a  --  well , I 'm a friend of the family , and certainly of hers . If you have any message , I could easily take it . " " Sorry , but the message is for Miss Hume . " He looked at me curiously , and then laughed . " By gad , you lawyers are a suspicious lot ! Look here , I really will give her the message , you know . This is n't an ogre 's den or a ? " He stopped . " Still , I think it would be best to see her . " At the rear of the hallway there was a sound of footsteps descending the stairs quickly . Mary Hume did not look ill . On the contrary , she looked strung up under a sort of hard docility which you could swear was assumed . The newspaper photograph had been surprisingly accurate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a plump chin : which features should not make for beauty , but in her they did . Her blonde hair was parted in the middle and drawn to a knot at the nape of the neck , but without an effect of curtness . She wore half-mourning , and displayed an engagement-ring.  | " Did I hear you say you had a message from H.M. ? " she asked without inflection . " Miss Hume ? Yes . " Reginald Answell had begun to rummage in a hatrack . His face appeared round the ring of hats with a smile of broad charm . " Well , I 'll be pushing off , Mary . " " Thanks for everything , " she said . " Oh , that 's all right . Fair exchange , " he told her with jocularity . " It 's all agreed , though ? " " You know me , Reg . " During this cryptic little exchange she had spoken in the same tone of affectionate docility . When he had nodded and gone out , closing the front door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left . It was a quiet drawingroom , with a telephone on a table between the two windows , and a bright fire burning under the marble mantelpiece . She took the envelope , and went close to the fire to break the seal . When she had read the brief message inside , she dropped it carefully into the fire , turning her head from side to side to watch until each corner had burned . Then she looked back at me , and her eyes were shining . " Just tell him yes , " she said . " Yes , yes , yes ! ? No , please ; just a moment ; do n't go . Were you in court this morning ? " " Yes . " " Please sit down for a moment . Have a cigarette . In the box there . " She sat down on the broad low scat round the fender , and tucked one leg up under her . The firelight made her hair look more fluffy . " Tell me , was it  --  pretty awful ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to H.M. I said he was behaving very well .  | " I knew he would . Are you on his side ? Do have a cigarette , please do . There , " she urged . I offered her the box , and lit one for her . She had very delicate hands ; they were trembling a little on the cigarette , which she held with both hands , and she looked up briefly over the match-flame . " Did they prove very much ? How would you have felt if you had been on the jury ? " " Not very much . Besides the opening speech , there were only two witnesses , because the examinations were fairly long . Miss Jordan and Dyer ? " " Oh , that 's all right . Amelia , " said Mary Hume with practicality , " does n't really dislike Jimmy , because she 's too obsessed with love 's young dream ; and she 'd like him even better if she had n't liked my father so much . " She hesitated . " I  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do they act to the people who go as witnesses ? I mean , do they go and yell in their ears , and storm and rave the way they do in the films ? " " They certainly do not , Miss Hume . Get that idea out of your head ! " " Not that it matters , really . " She looked sideways at the fire , and grew more calm . But a long puff of cigarette-smoke blew out against the flames , billowing back again , and she turned round once more . " Look here , tell me the truth before God : he 'll be all right , wo n't he ? " " Miss Hume , you can trust H.M. to take care of him . " " I know . I do . You see , I was the one who went to H.M. in the first place . That was a month ago , when Jimmy 's solicitor refused to have anything more to do with the case because he believed Jimmy was lying . I  --  I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompre-  | hensibly , but evidently thinking I knew . " It was only that I did n't know or guess . At first H.M. said he could n't help me , and raved and thundered ; and I 'm afraid I wept a bit ; and then he roared some more and said he 'd do it . The trouble is , my evidence may help Jimmy a little ; but it wo n't get him out of that awful business . And even now I have n't the remotest idea how H.M. intends to do it . " She paused . " Have you ? " " Nobody ever does know , " I admitted . " Honestly , the very fact that he 's so quiet about it means that he 's got something up his sleeve . " She gestured . " Oh , I suppose so . But I ca n't feel easy about something I do n't know . What good is it just to say everything will be all right ? " She spoke with great intensity . Getting up from the fireside seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hands clasped together as though she were cold . " When I told him as much as I knew , " she went on , " the only two things that seemed to interest him at all were things that simply made no sense . One was something about a Judas window ' " ? she sat down again ? " and the other was . about Uncle Spencer 's best golf-suit . " " Your uncle 's golf-suit ? What about it ? " " It 's gone , " said Mary Hume . I blinked . She made the statement as though it ought to convey something . My instructions were to discuss the case if she offered to do so , but here there was nothing to do but apply the spur of silence . " It ought to have been hanging up in the cupboard , and it was n't : though , " said the girl , " I can not see what the inkpad can have had to do with it , can you ? "  | I could quite agree with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Judas window , a golf-suit , and an ink-pad , it must be a very curious defense indeed . " That is , the ink-pad in the pocket of the suit , that Mr. Fleming was so keen to get . I  --  I hoped you 'd know something . But the fact is that both the suit and the ink-pad have gone. ? Oh , my God , I did n't know there was anyone in the house ! " The last words were spoken so low that I barely heard them . She got up , throwing her cigarette into the fire ; and an instant later she was a composed , docile hostess turning on her guest a face as blank as a dumpling . I glanced over my shoulder , and saw that Dr. Spencer Hume had come in . His tread was brisk but subdued , as though it became the situation . Dr. Hume 's round face , with its well-brushed hair showing a parting that must have been a quarter of an inch wide , showed domestic worry as well as sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his dead brother  --  passed incuriously over me , and seemed to study the room . " Hello , my dear , " he said lightly . " Have you seen my eyeglasses anywhere ? " " No , uncle . I 'm sure they 're not here . " Dr. Hume pinched at his chin . He went over and looked at the table , and then on the mantelpiece ; finally he stood at a loss , and his glance towards me was more interrogative . " This is a friend of mine , Uncle Spencer . Mr. ? " " Blake , " I said . " How do you do , " said Dr. Hume without inflection . " I seem to recognize your face , Mr. Blake . Have n't we met somewhere before ? " " Yes , your face is familiar too , doctor . "  | " Perhaps at the trial this morning , " he suggested . He shook his head , and glanced meaningly at the girl ; you would never have recognized in her the vital personality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake . Do n't keep Mary too long , will you ? " She spoke quickly . " How is the trial going , Uncle Spen-cer ? " " As well as can be expected , my dear . Unfortunately " ? I was to learn that he had a trick of beginning speeches with a hopeful assertion , and then saying , " Unfortunately , " with knitted brows ? " unfortunately , I 'm afraid there can be only one verdict . Of course , if Merrivale knows his job properly he 'll have medical evidence there to prove insanity beyond any doubt . Unfortunately ? By Jove , yes ! I remember where I 've seen you now , Mr. Blake ! I think I noticed you talking to Sir Henry 's secretary in the hall of the Old Bailey ? " " Sir Henry and I have been associates for a good many years , Dr. Hume , " I said truthfully . He looked interested . " You are not appearing in the case , though ? " " No . " " I-I 'm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think of this unfortunate business ? " " Oh , he 'll be acquitted , undoubtedly . " There was a silence . Only the firelight illumined this room ; the day had turned black and windy . What effect I was having in pursuing my instructions to " spread a little mysterious disquiet " I could not tell . But Dr. Hume thoughtlessly took a pair of black-ribboned eyeglasses out of his waistcoat pocket , fitted them on his nose with some care , and looked at me . " Guilty but insane , you mean ? "  | " Sane and not guilty . " " But that 's preposterous ! Utterly preposterous ! The boy is mad . Why , his evidence about the whisky alone ? I beg your pardon ; I suppose I really should n't be discussing this . I believe they expect to call me as a witness this afternoon . By the way , I always had an impression that witnesses were herded together and kept under surveillance like jurymen ; but I learn that this is so only in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , considering that the ? er  --  issue is so clear . " " If you 're a witness for the prosecution , Uncle Spencer , " said the girl , " will they let you say Jimmy is crazy ? " " Probably not , my dear ; but I shall manage to suggest it . I owe you that much , at least . " Again he looked at me meaningly . " Now see here , Mr. Blake . I quite appreciate your position . I know you want to give Mary all the comfort you can , and keep her spirits up at a time of great trial . But to encourage false hopes is  --  confound it , sir , it 's heartless ! That 's what I said : heartless , and there 's no other word for it . Just remember , Mary , that your poor old father is lying out there , dead and murdered and under ground ; and that will be all the support you need . " He allowed a pause , after which he consulted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added briskly . " Time and tide wait for no man , ' as they say . Er  --  by the way , Mary , did I understand you to be talking some nonsense about my brown tweed suit , that old suit ? " She was sitting on the fender-seat , her hands clasped round her knees . Now she looked up briefly . " It was a very good suit , Uncle Spencer . It cost twelve guineas . And you want to get it back , do n't you ? " He regarded her with concern . " Now there , Mary , is a  | fine example of the way people will catch at trifles at a time of  --  of bereavement ! Good Lord , my dear , why are you so concerned over that suit ? I 've told you I sent it to the cleaner 's . Naturally , afterwards , I was not concerned with an old golf-suit when there were so many other things to think of ! I simply neglected to call for it , and it 's still at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . " " You understand that , do you , my dear ? " " Yes , " she said . " Did you send it to the cleaner 's with the ink-pad and the rubber-stamps still in the pocket ? And what about the Turkish slippers ? " There would seem nothing in this calculated to disturb anyone , though it was not very intelligible . But Dr. Hume removed his eyeglasses and put them back into his pocket . At the same time I noticed that the draperies at the doorway had stirred , and a man was looking through . The light was not strong enough to see him well : he appeared to be a thin man with white hair and a nondescript face : but one hand was holding to a fold of the curtain , and seemed to be twisting it . " I suppose I must have done so , my dear , " said Dr. Hume , in such an altered voice that it was like the sudden grip of that hand on the curtain . Yet he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if I were you . They are honest people , these cleaners . Well , well , I must be getting along . Er ? ? Oh , I beg your pardon . This is Dr. Tregannon , a friend of mine . " The man in the doorway dropped his hand and bowed slightly . " Dr. Tregannon is a mental specialist , " explained the other , smiling . " Well , I still must be getting along . Good  | clay , Mr. Blake . Do n't stuff up Mary 's head with nonsense , and do n't let her do the same thing to you . Try to get some sleep this afternoon , my dear . I 'll give you some medicine tonight , and it will make you forget all your troubles . Sleep that knits up the ravell 'd sleave of care , ' does n't Shakespeare say ? Yes . Quite so . Good day . "  | VI " A Piece of Blue Feather " THE man in the witness-box of Courtroom Number One , Central Criminal Courts , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a sentence when I came creeping in. " ? and so , of course , I thought of the ink-pad . Like ' precautions to take before the doctor comes , ' you know . Only this was a policeman . " Mr. Randolph Fleming was a large , burly man with a stiff red mustache which forty years ago would have been remarkable even in the Guards . He had a bearing of the same sort , and was not abashed . With the darkening of the day , the concealed lights under the cornices of the oak paneling threw a theatrical glow up over its white dome . But , crawIing in some minutes after proceedings had begun , I thought not so much of a theater as a church . Evelyn glowered at me , and then whispered excitedly : " Sh-hl He 's just confirmed all Dyer said about finding the body , up to the time Answell swore he had taken a drugged drink ; and they found none of the whisky or the soda had been tapped . Sh-h ! What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heads were turning towards us , and that mention of an ink-pad had caught me . Mr. Randolph Fleming took a deep breath , expanding his chest , and  | looked round the court with interest . His enormous vitality seemed to enliven counsel . Flemings large face was somewhat withered , with a pendulous jowl dominated by the stiff red mustache ; his eyelids were wrinkled , and the eyes very sharp . You felt that there should be a monocle in one of them , or some sort of helmet on his stiff brown hair . At intervals in the questioning  --  when there was a cessation of movement like the clogging of a motion-picture film  --  he would study the judge , study the banisters , and look up to study the people in the gallery . When he spoke , Fleming 's jowl moved in and out like a bull-frog 's . Huntley Lawton was examining . " Explain what you mean about the ink-pad , Mr. Fleming . " " Well , it was like this , " answered the witness , drawing in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the button-hole of his pepper-and-salt suit . " When we had looked at the sideboard and seen that the decanter and the siphon were both full , I said to the prisoner , I said " ? pause , as though for consideration ? " Why do n't you be a man and admit you did it ? Look at that arrow over there , ' I said . ' You can see there are fingerprints there ; and they 'll be yours , wo n't they ? ' " " What did he say to that ? " " Nothing . Ab-so-lutely nothing ! Consequently , I thought of taking his fingerprints . I 'm a practical man ; always have been ; that 's how I came to think of it . I said to Dyer that if we had an ink-pad  --  you know the sort of thing : one of those little pads that you press rubber-stamps on  --  we could get a good clear set . He said that Dr. Hume had just recently bought some rubber stamps and an ink-pad , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered  | because he had intended to take the stamps out in case they soiled the pocket , so he offered to go upstairs and fetch ? " " We quite understand , Mr. Fleming . Did you get the inkpad and take the prisoner 's fingerprints ? " The witness , who had been thrusting out his neck with earnestness , seemed ruffled at the interruption . " No , sir , we did not . That is , not that particular ink-pad . Dyer could n't find the suit , it seems , or it was n't there . But he did manage to fish up an old one from the desk , in violet ink , and we got a set of the prisoner 's fingerprints on a piece of paper . " " This piece of paper ? Show it to the witness , please . " " Yes , that 's the one . " " Did the prisoner make any objections to this ? " " Yes , a bit . " " What did he do ? " " Nothing much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " Nothing much , " said the witness in a heavy growl . " He caught me off balance . He gave me a sort of shove with his open hand . My feet were off balance , and I went over against the wall and fell down a bit . " " A sort of shove . I see . What was his manner when he did this : angry ? " " Yes , he was in a devil of a rage all of a sudden . We were trying to hold his arms down so we could get his prints . " " He gave you a sort of shove ' and you fell down a bit . ' In other words , he struck hard and quickly ? " " He caught me off balance . " " Just answer the question , please . All of a sudden he struck hard and quickly . Is that so ? " " Yes , or he would n't have caught me off balance . "  | " Very well . Now , Mr. Fleming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , shown in photograph 8 , from which the arrow had been taken down ? " " Yes , I went all over it . " " Did the small staples  --  the staples that held the arrow to the wall  --  show signs of having been wrenched out violently , as though the arrow had been suddenly jerked down ? " " Yes , they were all over the floor . " Counsel consulted his brief . After this little brush , Fleming squared his shoulders , lifted his elbow , and put one fist on the rail of the witness-box . He took a good survey of the court , as though challenging anyone to question his answers ; but his forehead was ruffled with small wrinkles . Once , I remember , he happened to look straight into my eyes from across the room . And I wondered , as you always do on these occasions , " What 's that fellow really thinking ? " Or , for that matter , you might wonder what the prisoner was really thinking . He was much more restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in the dock moves in his chair , you are conscious of it ; like a movement on an empty dance-floor such as the dock resembled . A shifting , an unquiet stealing of the hands , seems to come close to you . Often he would glance towards the solicitors ' table  --  in the direction , it seemed , of the grave and cynically preoccupied Reginald Answell . The prisoner 's eyes looked rather wild and worried ; his big shoulders were stooped . Lollypop , H.M. 's secretary , was now at the solicitors ' table , wearing her paper cuffs and poring over a typewritten sheet . Counsel cleared his throat to resume . " You have told us , Mr. Fleming , that you are a member  | of several archery societies , and have been an archer for many years ? " " That 's so . " " So that you could describe yourself as something of an authority on the subject ? " " Yes , I think I could safely say that , " returned the witness , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want you to look at this arrow and describe it . " Fleming seemed puzzled . " I do n't know what you want me to say , exactly . It 's the standard type of men 's arrow : red pinewood , twenty-eight inches long , quarter of an inch thick , iron pile or point footed with bullet-tree wood , nock made of horn ? " He turned it over in his hands . " The nock , yes . Will you explain what the nock is ? " " The nock is this little wedge-shaped piece of horn at the end of the arrow . There 's a notch in it  --  here . That 's how you fit the arrow to the bowstring . Like this . " He illustrated with a backward gesture , and banged his hand against the post supporting the roof of the witnessbox : to his evident surprise and annoyance . " Could that arrow have been fired ? " " It could not . Out of the question . " " You would call it definitely impossible ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's fingerprints were the only marks on ? " " I must ask you not to anticipate the evidence , Mr. Fleming . Why is it impossible that the arrow could have been fired ? " " Look at the nock ! It 's been bent over and twisted so much that you could n't possibly fit it to a string . " " Was the nock in this condition when you first saw it in the deceased 's body ? "  | " Yes , it was . " " Will you just pass that along for the inspection of the jury ? Thank you . Having established that the arrow could not have been fired : in the coating of dust you tell us you observed on the arrow , did you observe anywhere  --  anywhere  --  any marks except those which you knew to be finger-prints ? " " I did not . " " That is all . " He sat down . While the arrow traveled among the jury , a long and rumbling throat-clearing preceded the rise of H.M. There are sounds and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , for Lollypop made a quietly fiendish sign of warning , and for some reason held up the typewritten sheet over which she had been poring . Trouble blew into that room as palpably as a wind , but H.M. 's opening was mild enough . " You 've told us that on that Saturday night you were goin ' next door to play chess with the deceased . " " That 's right . " ( Fleming 's truculent tone added , " And what of it ? " ) " When did the deceased make an appointment with you ? " " About three o'clock in the afternoon . " " Uh-huh . For what time that night ? " " He said to drop in about a quarter to seven , and we 'd have a bite of cold dinner together , since everybody else in the house was out . " " When Miss Jordan ran over and brought you , you 've told us you were already on your way to keep that appoint-ment ? " " Yes . I was a bit early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a dekko  --  hurrum  --  just glance at that arrow again . Look at those three feathers . I think I 'm right in statin ' that they 're fixed edgeways to the arrow about an inch from the nock-end , and they 're about two and a half inches long ? " " Yes . The size of the feathers varies , but Hume preferred the biggest ones . " " You notice that the middle feather is torn off pretty sharply about half-way down . Was it like that when you found the body ? " Fleming looked at him suspiciously , on guard behind his red mustache . " Yes , that 's how it was . " " You 've heard the witness Dyer testify that all the feathers were intact and whole at the time the accused went into that study at 6.1o ? " " I 've heard it . " " Sure . We all did . Consequently , the feather must ' a ' been broken off between then and the discovery of the body ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struck at Hume , holdin ' the arrow half-way down the shaft , how do you think the feather got torn off ? " " I do n't know . In the struggle , probably . Hume made a grab at the arrow when he saw it coming ? " " He made a grab at the end of the arrow opposite the end that was threatenin ' him ? " " He might have . Or it might have been torn off when the arrow was pulled off the wall , from those little staples . " " That 's another theory . The piece of feather was broken off either ( I ) in a struggle ; or ( 2 ) when the arrow was pulled down . Uh-huh . In either case , where is it ? Did you find it when you searched the room ? "  |  | " No , I did not ; but a little piece of feather ? " " I 'm suggestin ' to you that this little piece of feather ' was an inch and a quarter long by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd have noticed half-a-crown on the floor , would n't you ? " " Yes , but this did n't happen to be half-a-crown . " " I 've said it was a lot bigger . And it was painted bright blue , was n't it ? " " I suppose so . " " What was the color of the carpet ? " " I ca n't say I can swear to that . " " Then I 'll tell you : it was light brown . You accept that ? Yes . And you agree that there was very little furniture ? Uhhuh . But you made an intensive search of that room , and you still did n't find the missin ' piece ? " Hitherto the witness had seemed rather pleased at his own wit , set to shine , and at intervals tickling up the corners of his mustache . Now he was impatient . " How should I know ? Maybe it got lodged somewhere ; maybe it 's still there . Why do n't you ask the police-inspec-tor ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund of information about archery . Take those three feathers at the end of the arrow . Have they got any kind o ' useful purpose , or are t hey only decorative ? " Fleming seemed surprised . " Certainly they have a purpose . They 're set at equal intervals , parallel to the line of flight ; you can see that . The natural curve of the feathers gives the arrow a rotary motion in the air  --  zzz ! ? like that . I , i ke a rifle-bullet . " Is one feather always a different color from the rest , like this ? "  | " Yes , the guide feather ; it shows you where to fit the arrow on the string . " " When you buy these arrows , " pursued H.M. , in a rumbling and dreamy tone , while the other stared at him , " are the feathers already attached , or do you fasten on your own ? " " As a rule they 're already attached . Naturally . But some people prefer to put on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thinkin ' that the deceased did ? " " Yes . I do n't know how you know it ; but he used a different type . Most arrows have turkey-feathers . Flume preferred goose-feathers , and put them on himself : I suppose he liked the old gray-goose-feather tradition . These are goose-feathers . Shanks , the odd-jobs ' man , usually fastened them on for him . " " And this little joker here : the guide-feather , you call it . Am I rightly instructed when I say he used a special type of dye , of his own invention , to color the guide-feather ? " " Yes , he did . In his workshop ? " " His workshop ! " said H.M. , coming to life . " His workshop . Just where was this workshop ? Get the plan of the house and show us . " There was a general ruffling and unrolling of plans among the jury . Several of us stirred in our seats , wondering what the old man might have up the sleeve of that disreputable gown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , looked up and frowned . " It 's here . It 's a little detached building in the back garden , about twenty yards from the house . I think it was intended to be a greenhouse once ; but Hume did n't care for that sort of thing . It 's partly glass . " H.M. nodded . " What did the deceased keep there ? "  | " His archery equipment . Bows , strings , arrows , drawinggloves ; things like that . Old Shanks dyed the arrows there , too , with Hume 's own stuff . " " What else ? " " If you want the whole catalogue , " retorted the witness , " I 'll give it to you . Arm-guards , waist-belts for the arrows , worsted tassels to clean the points with , a grease-pot or two for the drawing-fingers of the glove  --  and a few tools , of c curse . Hume was a good man with his hands . " " Nothing else ? " " Nothing that I remember . " " You 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So. ? Now , you 've testified that that arrow could n't ' a ' been fired . I suggest to you that that statement was n't what you meant at all . You 'll agree that the arrow could have been projected ? " " I do n't see what you mean . What 's the difference ? " " What 's the difference ? Looky here ! You see this inkwell ? Well , if I threw it at you right now , it would n't be fired from a bow ; but you 'll thoroughly agree that it would be projected . Would n't it ? " " Yes . " " Yes . And you could take that arrow and project it at me ? " " I could ! " said the witness . His tone implied , " And , by God , I 'd like to . " Both of diem had powerful voices , which were growing steadily niorc audible . At this point Sir Walter Storm , the AttorneyGeneral , rose with a clearing of the throat . " My lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calm would have rebuked a bishop , " I do not like to inter-  | rupt my learned friend . But I should only like to inquire whether my learned friend is suggesting that this arrow , which weighs perhaps three ounces , could have been thrown so as to penetrate eight inches into a human body ? ? I can only suggest that my learned friend appears to be confusing an arrow with an assegai , not to say a harpoon . " The back of H.M. 's wig began to bristle . Lollypop made a fierce wig-wagging gesture . " Me lord , " replied H.M. , with a curious choking noise , " what I meant will sort of emerge in my next question to the witness . " " Proceed , Sir Henry . " H.M. got his breath . " What I mean is this , " he said to Fleming . " Could this arrow have been fired from a cross-bow ? " There was a silence . The judge put down his pen carefully . He turned his round face with the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , Sir Henry , " interposed Mr. Justice Bodkin . " What exactly is a crossbow ? " " I got one right here , " said H.M. From under his desk he dragged out a great cardboard box such as those which are used to pack suits . From this he took a heavy , deadly looking mechanism whose wood and steel shone with some degree of polish . It was not long in the stock , which was shaped like that of a dwarf rifle : sixteen inches at most . But at the head was a broad semi-circle of flexible steel , to each end of which was attached a cord running back to a notched windlass , with an ivory handle , on the stock . A trigger connected with this windlass . Down the center of the flat barrel ran a groove . The crossbow , whose stock was inlaid with mother-of-pearl , should have  | seemed incongruous in H.M. 's hands under all those peering eyes . It was not . It suddenly looked more like a weapon of the future than a weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.M. , completely un-self-conscious like a child with a toy , " is the short stump ' crossbow . Sixteenth-century French cavalry . Principle 's this , y'see . It 's wound up  --  like this . " He began to turn the handle . To the accompaniment of an ugly clicking noise , the cords began to move and pull back the corners of the steel horns . " Down that groove goes a steel bolt called a quarrel . The trigger 's pressed , and releases it like a catapult . Out goes the bolt with all the weight of Toledo steel released behind it ... . ' I'lie bolt 's shorter than an arrow . But it could fire an ; tit ow .. Ile snapped the trigger , with some effect . Sir Walter Storm rose . The Attorney-General 's voice quieted an incipient buzz . " My lord , " he said gravely , " all this is very interesting ? whether or not it is evidence . Does my learned friend put forward as an alternative theory that this crime was committed with the singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . The judge was not . " Yes ; I was about to ask you that , Sir Henry . " RM. put down the crossbow on his desk . " No , my lord . This bow comes from the Tower of London . I was illust ratin ' . " He turned towards the witness again . " Did Avory flume ever own any crossbows ? " " As a matter of fact , he did , " replied Fleming . From the press box just under the jury , two men who had to make early afternoon editions got up and tiptoed out on egg shells . The witness looked irritated but interested . " I.ong time ago , " he added with a growl , " the Woodmen  | of Kent experimented with crossbows one year . They were n't any good . They were cumbersome , and they had n't got any range compared to arrows . " " Uh-huh . How many crossbows did the deceased own ? " " Two or three , I think . " " Was any of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was three years ago , and ? " " Where did he keep the bows ? " " In that shed in the back garden . " " But you forgot that a minute ago , did n't you ? " " It slipped my mind , yes . Naturally . " They were both bristling again . Fleming 's heavy nose and jaw seemed to come together like Punch 's . " Now let 's have your opinion as an expert : could that arrow have been fired from a bow like this ? " " Not with any accuracy . It 's too long , and it would fit too loosely . You 'd send the shot wild at twenty yards . " " Could it have been fired , I 'm asking you ? " " I suppose it could . " " You suppose it could ? You know smackin ' well it could , do n't you ? ? Here , gim me that arrow and I 'll show you . " Sir Walter Storm was on his feet , suavely . " A demonstration will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned friend 's statement . We also appreciate that the witness is merely attempting to express an honest opinion under somewhat trying circumstances . " ( " This is what I meant , " Evelyn whispered to me . " You see ? They 'll bait the old bear until he ca n't see the ring for blood . " ) It was certainly the general impression that H.M. had badly mismanaged things , in addition to proving nothing .  | His last two questions were asked in an almost plaintive tone . " Never mind its accuracy at twenty yards . Would it be accurate at a very short distance  --  a few feet ? " " Probably . " " In fact , you could n't miss ? " " Not at two or three feet , no . " " That 's all . " The Attorney-General 's brief re-examination disposed of this suggestion and cut it off at the root . " In order to kill the deceased in the way my learned friend has suggested , the person using the crossbow must have been within two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " returned Fleming , thawing a little . " In other words , actually in the room ? " " Yes . " " Exactly . Mr. Fleming , when you entered this locked and sealed room ? " " Now , we 'll object to that , " said H.M. , suddenly rearing up again with a wheeze and a flutter of papers . For the first time Sir Walter was a trifle at a loss . He turned towards H.M. , and we got a look at his face . It was long and strong , dark-browed despite its slight ruddiness : a powerful face . But both he and H.M. addressed the judge as though speaking to each other through an interpreter . " My lord , what is it to which my learned friend takes ex-ception ? " " ' Sealed . ' " The judge was looking at H.M. with bright and steady eyes of interest ; but he spoke dryly . " The term was perhaps a little fanciful , Sir Walter . " " I readily withdraw it , my lord . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every possible entrance or exit was barred on the inside ? " " Object again , " said H.M. " Ahem . When you entered , " said the other , his voice beginning to sound with far-off thunder in spite of himself , " this room whose door was firmly bolted on the inside , and its windows closed with locked shutters , did you find any such singular apparatus as that ? " He pointed to the crossbow . " No , I did not . " " It is not a thing that could be readily overlooked , is it ? " " It certainly is not , " replied the witness , with jocularity . " Thank you . " " Call Dr. Spencer Hume. "  | VII " Standing Near the Ceiling ? " FIVE minutes later they were still looking for Dr. Spencer I fume , and we knew that something was wrong . I saw II.M. ' s big hands close , though he gave no other sign . HuntIcy Lawton rose . " My lord , the witness appears to be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lawton . Do I understand that you move an adjournment until the witness shall be found ? " A conference ensued , in which several glances were directed towards H.M. Then Sir Walter Storm got up . " My lord , the nature of the Crown 's case is such that we believe we can save the time of the court by dispensing with his testimony and continuing with our evidence in the ordinary course . " " That decision must rest with you , Sir Walter . At the same time , if the witness is under subpoena , he should be here . I think the matter should be investigated . " " Of course , my lord . . . . " Call Frederick John Hardcastle . " Frederick John Hardcastle , a police constable , testified as to the discovery of the body . While he was on duty in Grosvenor Street at 6.45 P.M. , a man whom he now knew to be Dyer came out of the house and said , " Officer , come in ;  | something terrible has happened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove up : the car contained Dr. Spencer Hume and a woman ( Miss Jordan ) who seemed to have fainted . In the study he found the prisoner and a man who introduced himself as Mr. Fleming . P.C. Hardcastle said to the prisoner , " How did this happen ? " The prisoner replied , " I know nothing at all about it , " and would say nothing more . The witness then telephoned to his divisional police-station , and remained on guard until the arrival of the inspector . There was no cross-examination . The prosecution then called Dr. Philip McLane Stocking . Dr. Stocking was a lean and bushy-haired man with a hard , narrow mouth but a curiously sentimental look about him . He got hold of the dock-rail and never let go of it . He had an untidy string-tie done into a bow , and a black suit which ( lid not fit too well ; but his hands were so clean that they looked polished . " Your name is Philip McLane Stocking , and you are Professor of Forensic Medicine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division of the Metropolitan Police ? " " I am . " " On January 4 , last , were you called in to 12 Grosvenor Street , and did you arrive there at about 7.45 ? " " I did . " " When you arrived , what did you find in the study ? " " I found the dead body of a man lying between the window and the desk , face upwards , and very close to the desk . " The witness had a rather thick voice , which he had difficulty in keeping clear . " Dr. Hume was present , and Mr. Fleming , and the prisoner . I said , Has he been moved ? ' The prisoner answered , I turned him over on his back . He was lying on  | his left side with his face almost against the desk . ' The hands were growing cold ; the upper arms and the body were ( flute warm . Rigor mortis was setting in in the upper part of the left arm and in the neck . I judged he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible to be more definite than that ? " " I should say death occurred between 6 and 6.3o . I can not say closer than that . " " You performed a post-mortem examination of this body ? " " Yes . Death was caused by the iron point of an arrow penetrating eight inches through the wall of the chest and piercing the heart . " " Was death instantaneous ? " " Yes , it must have been absolutely instantaneous . Like that , " added the witness , suddenly snapping his fingers with the effect of a conjuring trick . " Could he have moved or taken a step afterwards ? ? What I wish to put to you , " insisted Sir Walter , extending his arm , " is whether he would have had strength enough to bolt a door or a window after being struck ? " " It is definitely impossible . He fell almost literally in his tracks . " " What conclusion did you form from the nature of the wound ? " " I formed the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a powerful blow had been struck by a powerful man . " " Such as the prisoner ? " " Yes , " agreed Dr. Stocking , giving a brief and sharp look at Answell . " What were your reasons for this conclusion ? "  | " The direction of the wound . It entered high  --  here , " he illustrated , " and sloped down in an oblique direction to penetrate the heart . " " At a sharp angle , you mean ? A downward stroke ? " " Yes . " " What do you think of any suggestion that the arrow might have been fired at him ? " " If you ask me for an expression of a personal opinion , I should call it so unlikely as to be almost impossible . " " Why ? " " If the arrow had been fired at him , I should have expected it to have penetrated in more or less a straight line ; but certainly not at any such angle as the arrow stood . " Sir Walter lifted two fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fired at him , the person who fired it must have been standing somewhere up near the ceiling ? aiming downwards . " It seemed to me that he just refrained from adding , " like Cupid ? " There were overtones in Sir Walter 's voice that piled thick ridicule without a word being said . I could have sworn that for a second a brief and fishy smile appeared on the face of one of the jury , who usually sat as though they were stuffed . The atmosphere was getting colder . " Yes , something like that . Or else the victim must have been bent forward almost double , as though he were giving a low bow to the murderer . " " Did you find any signs of a struggle ? " " Yes . The deceased man 's collar and tie were rumpled ; his jacket was humped up a little about his neck ; his hands were dirty and there was a small scratch on the palm of the right hand . " " What might have caused this scratch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the arrow might have caused it . " " As though he had put out a hand to defend himself , you mean ? " " Yes . " " Vas there any blood from this scratch on the dead man 's hand ? " " It bled a little , yes . " " Did you , in the course of your examination , find a stain of blood on any other object in the room ? " " No . " " Therefore it is likely that the scratch was , in fact , caused by the arrow ? " " I should deduce so . " " Will you tell us , doctor , what took place immediately after your first examination of the body in the study ? " Again the bushy-haired witness glanced at the prisoner ; his mouth had an expression of distaste . " Dr. Spencer Hume , ume , with whom I have some acquaintance , asked me whether I would look at the prisoner . " " Look at him ? " " Examine him . Dr. Hume said : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug ; I have just examined him and I can find nothing to support it : " " What was the prisoner 's demeanor during this time ? " " It was collected , much too calm and collected ; except that he would occasionally run his hand through his hair , like this . He was not nearly so much affected as I was myself . " " Did you examine him ? " " In a cursory way . His pulse was rapid and irregular ; not  | depressed as it would have been had he taken a narcotic . The pupils of the eyes were normal . " " In your opinion , had he taken a drug ? " " In my opinion , he had not . " " Thank you ; that is all . " ( " That 's torn it , " said Evelyn . The prisoner 's white face now wore an expression of puzzlement ; once he half rose in his chair as though to make an audible protest , and the two warders with him jerked to watchfulness . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly now ; and , if he were really innocent , what he must have been feeling was horror . ) H.M. lumbered to his feet and for a full half a minute stood staring at the witness . " So you examined him in a cursory way , ' did you ? " H.M. 's voice made even the judge look up . " Do you examine all your patients ' in a cursory way ' ? " " That is neither here nor there . " " It is if they die , ai n't it ? Do you think a man 's life should depend on an examination ' in a cursory way ' ? " " No . " " Or that sworn testimony in a court of law should depend on it ? " Dr. Stocking 's mouth grew tighter . " It was my duty to examine the body ; not to take a blood-test of the prisoner . Dr. Spencer Hume , I consider , is an authority sufficiently well known for me to accept his considered opinion . " " I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all based on what Dr. Hume thought  --  Dr. Hume , by the way , not bein ' here now ? " " My lord , I must protest against that implication , " cried Sir Walter Storm .  | " You will please confine yourself to what the witness says , Sir Henry . " " Begludship'spardon , " growled H.M. " I understood that the witness was confinin ' himself pretty closely to what Dr. IIume said . . . . Will you swear from your own knowledge that he had not taken a drug ? " " No , " snapped the witness , " I am not going to swear ; I am going to give an opinion ; and I swear that the opinion I give shall be an honest one . " The judge 's soft , even voice intervened . " I still do not understand . You think it impossible that the prisoner should have taken a drug ? That is the matter before us . " " No , my lord , I do not say it is impossible ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be going too far ? " " My lord , the prisoner told me that he took this drug , whatever it was , at about fifteen minutes past six . I did not examine him until nearly eight o'clock . If by any chance he had taken one , the effect would be largely worn off . However , Dr. Hume examined him before seven o'clock ? " " Dr. Hume 's opinion has not been presented to us , " said Mr. Justice Bodkin . " I should like to be quite clear about this , since the matter is vital . If the effect of this mysterious drug would have worn off in any case , I take it that you are hardly in a position to say a great deal about it ? " " My lord , I have said that I can only give an opinion . " " Very well . Proceed , Sir Henry . " H.M. , clearly well pleased , went on to other matters . " Dr. Stocking , there 's another side of this business that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suggestion that the arrow might ' a ' been projected . Let 's tike this question of the position of the body . Do you accept  | the accused 's statement that , at the beginnin ' , the body was lyin ' on its left side facing the side of the desk ? " The doctor smiled grimly . " I believe it is the accused 's statements that we are here to examine ; not to accept . " " Not under any circumstances , it 'd seem . Sure . But could you bring yourself to agree with that particular one ? " " I might . " " Is there anything you know of to contradict it ? " " No , I can not say that there is . " " For the sake of argument , then . Suppose the deceased had been standing on that side of the desk  --  which would be ( look at your plan , there ) facin ' the sideboard across the room . Suppose he had been bendin ' over to look at something on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrow had been discharged at him from the direction of the sideboard : might it have gone into the body just the way it did ? " " It is remotely possible . " " Thanks ; nothing else . " H.M. plumped down . The Attorney-General was curt in his re-examination . " Had matters taken place in any such fashion as my learned friend suggests , " observed Sir Walter Storm , " would there have been any signs of a struggle ? " " I should not have expected to find any . " " You would not have expected to find the rumpled collar and tie , the disarranged coat , the grimy hands , the cut on the palm of the right hand ? " " No . " " Can we believe that the cut on the palm of the hand was caused by any attempt to seize in the air at an arrow fired at the deceased ? "  | " Personally , I should call it ridiculous . " " Do you consider it likely that a murderer , equipped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " Finally , doctor , with regard to your qualifications to pronounce on whether or not a drug had been swallowed by the prisoner : you were for twenty years on the staff of St. Praed 's Hospital , Praed Street ? " " I was . " I had noticed him a number of times without knowing who he was . Inspector Mottram was slow-footed , sure-footed , careful of both manner and speech . He was comparatively young , not more than forty ; but his smooth style of replying to questions , never in a hurry to get out an answer too quickly , indicated some experience of court . His manner , as he stood at attention , seemed to say , " I do n't particularly like putting a rope around anyone 's neck ; but let 's not have any nonsense ; murder is always murder , and the quicker we dispatch a criminal the better it will be for society . " He had a square face and a short nose , a face running to jaw , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sharply penetrating or that he needed glasses . The air of a well-brushed family man , defending society , invaded the court . He took the oath in a strong voice , and fixed his penetrating or near-sighted eyes on counsel . " I am a Divisional Detective-Inspector of the Metropolitan Police . In consequence of what I was told , I proceeded The doctor was allowed to stand down , and the Crown then called its most damning witness  --  Harry Ernest Mottram . I Inspector Mottram had been sitting at the solicitors ' table .  | to 12 Grosvenor Street and arrived there at 6.55 P.M. on January 4 . " " What happened ? " " I was conducted to the room called the study , where I found the accused in company with Mr. Fleming , the butler , and Police-Constable Hardcastle . I questioned the last three , who told me what they have already testified to here . I then asked the accused if he had anything to say . He replied , ' If you will get these harpies out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I asked the others to leave the room . Then I shut the door and sat down opposite the accused . " The statement made by the prisoner , as the inspector quoted it , was much the same as that which had been read by the Attorney-General in his opening speech . As Mottram repeated it in dispassionate tones , it sounded even balder and thinner . When it came to the part about the drugging of the whisky , Sir Walter intervened . " The prisoner told you that the deceased had given him a glass of whisky and soda ; that he had drunk over half of it , and then put the glass down on the floor ? " " Yes , by his chair . " " I think , Inspector Mottram , that you are a teetotaler ? " " Yes . " " And , " said counsel very gently , " was there any smell of whisky on the prisoner 's breath ? " " None whatever . " The thing was so simple , so obvious , that I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly had that effect , for it was a practical and everyday point which came home to the jury . " Go on , Inspector . "  | " When he had finished making this statement , I said to him , ' You realize that what you tell me can not possibly be true ? ' He replied , ' It is a frame-up , Inspector ; I swear to God it is a frame-up ; but I can not see how they can all be crooked , or why they should have it in for me anyway . ' " " What did you understand him to mean by this ? " " I understood that he referred to the other people in the house . He made no difficulty in talking to me ; I should describe him as friendly and almost eager . But he appeared to have strong suspicions of every member of the household , or friend of the family , who came near him . I then said to him , ' If you acknowledge that the door was bolted on the inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else have done what you say ? ' " " What did he say to this ? " The witness looked mildly bothered . " He began speaking about detective stories , and ways of bolting doors or locking windows from the outside  --  with bits of string or wire , and things like that . " " Are you a reader of detective fiction , Inspector ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do you know of any such methods as he referred to ? " " Well , sir , I have heard of one or two ; and , with a whole lot of luck , they might be practical . " Inspector Mottram looked hesitant and a little apologetic . " But none of them could possibly apply in this case . " At counsel 's signal , the exhibit of the dummy shutters was again brought forward , and this time the door as well : a solid piece of oak attached to a practical frame . " I understand that the same evening you removed the shutters and the door , assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had been sitting down most of the time  --  a kind of bulge on his right hip under the overcoat . " " What did he say ? " " He said , It wo n't be necessary ; I know what you want . ' And he opened his overcoat , and reached into his hip pocket , and gave it to me . " " Gave what to you ? " " A .38 caliber automatic pistol , fully loaded , " said the witness . and took them to the police station for purposes of experi-ment ? " " I did . " " Will you tell us why no such method could apply here ? " It was an old story ; but it stood up solid and unbreakable as the Old Bailey itself when Mottram explained . " After you had questioned him about the door and the windows , Inspector , what did you do ? " " I asked him if he would object to being searched I ob-  | VIII " The Old Bear Was Not Blind " A .38 CALIBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone behind us began softly to hum , " 0 Who Will O'er the Downs with Me ? " to words which sounded like , " 0 Who Said He was Inn-o-cent ? " The atmosphere of skepticism was now so heavy that you could feel it in people 's very gravity . At the moment I happened to be looking at Reginald Answell , and for the first time an exhibit seemed to interest the prisoner 's cousin . He looked up briefly ; but his saturnine good-looks betrayed nothing except a certain superciliousness . He fell again to playing with the water-carafe on the solicitors ' table . " Is this the pistol he had in his pocket ? " pursued Sir Walter Storm . " Yes . " " Did the prisoner explain how he happened to come for a peaceful discussion of his prospective marriage with a weapon like that in his pocket ? " " IIe denied that he had brought it . He said that someone must have put it there while he was unconscious . " " Someone must have put it there while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the weapon ? " " The accused said to me , I know it very well . It belongs  | to my cousin Reginald . When he is not in the East he sometimes stays at my flat , and I believe that the last time I saw the pistol was a month ago , in the drawer of the sittingroom table . I have not seen it since : " After lengthy and convincing testimony had been made as to an examination of the room , the witness was taken to a summing-up . " What conclusions did you form , from this , as to the way in which the crime had been committed ? " " From the way in which the arrow had been pulled down from the wall , I concluded that it had been dragged from right to left , by a hand holding the arrow in the position where the fingerprints are . This would have put the person who pulled it down on the side of the room a little towards the sideboard . Under these circumstances , I concluded that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side towards the front of it , in order to get away from his assail-ant ? " " In other words , to put the desk between himself and his assailant . " " Yes , like that , " agreed Inspector Mottram , making a boxed motion with his hands , and moving them to illustrate . " I concluded that the assailant had then run round the front of the desk . There was then a struggle , with the deceased standing in a position very close to the desk and facing the sideboard . In this struggle the missing piece of feather was broken off , and the deceased also acquired the cut on his hand . The victim was then struck . He fell down beside the desk , getting the dust on his hands when he  --  he pawed at the carpet just before he died . That is how I believed it to happen . " " Or might he have seized at the arrow , and caught at the 1  | shaft to get dust on his hands ? What I mean is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test for fingerprints , since it was buried in the deceased 's body ? " " Yes . " " The dust on the hands may have come from there ? " " Quite possibly . " " Finally , Inspector . I believe you are a qualified fingerprint expert , and were trained for this branch of the serv-ice ? " " Yes , that is so . " " Did you take a record of the prisoner 's fingerprints : first in Grosvenor Street , using the pad of violet ink provided there , and later at the district police station ? " " I did . " " Did you compare these with the fingerprints on the shaft of the arrow ? " " I did . " " Please identify these photographs , showing the various sets of prints , and explain the points of agreement to the jury .... Thank you . Were the prints on the arrow made I , y the prisoner ? " " They were . " " Were any fingerprints found in the room other than those of the deceased and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fingerprints found on the decanter of whisky , 1 he siphon , or the four glasses ? " " No . " " Where else were fingerprints of the prisoner found ? " " On the chair in which he was sitting , on the desk  --  and on the bolt of the door . " After a few more questions relating to the final arrest  | of Answell , the examination was finished . It had been , in its way , a tightening and summing-up of the whole case . If H.M. had any attack to launch , now was the time to launch it . The clock on the wall up over our heads must be crawling on ; for it was growing dark outside , and a few whips of rain struck the glass roof . The white-and-oak of the courtroom acquired a harder brilliance from its lights . H.M. got up , spread out his hands on the desk , and asked the following abrupt question : " Who bolted the door ? " " Excuse me , I did not quite catch that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside ? " Inspector Mottram did not blink . " The prisoner 's fingerprints were on the bolt , sir . " " We 're not denyin ' that he un-bolted it . But who bolted it ? Were there any other prints on the bolt besides the pris-oner 's ? " " Yes , the deceased man 's . " " So the deceased might ' a ' bolted it just as well as the prisoner ? " " Yes , he might : quite easily . " " Now , let 's get this story of the crime quite clear . The witness Dyer has testified that at about 6.15 he heard the deceased say , Man , what 's wrong with you ? Have you gone mad ? ' and then sounds like a scuffle : hey ? . . . In your opinion , was this the scuffle where Hume got killed ? " Inspector Mottram was not to be caught in any such trap as that . He shook his head , narrowed his eyes , and gave the matter grave attention . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " From the evidence I have submitted , we concluded that  | this scuffle was a brief one , terminated when the witness Dyer knocked at the door and asked what was wrong . The door was then bolted on the inside ? " " So that they could continue their fight in peace and cornfort , you mean ? " " 1 can not say as to that , " returned the witness , completely unruffled . " So that no one could go in . " " And they then went on fightin ' for fifteen minutes ? " " No , the quarrel may have broken out again fifteen minutes later . " " I see . But if the prisoner bolted the door at 6.15 , it must have meant that he was ready for business , must n't it ? Would he have bolted the door and then sat down to talk peacefully afterwards ? " " He might . " " You expect the jury to believe that ? " " I expect the jury to believe what my lord tells them is evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , I have said that the deceased himself might have bolted the door ? " " Oh ? " roared H.M. " In fact , you think it likely that he did ? " " Well , yes , " admitted the inspector , and squared himself . " Good . Now , we 're asked to believe that the accused went to that house with a loaded gun in his pocket . That 'd show premeditation , would n't it ? " " People do not usually carry weapons unless they think t hey may have a use for them . " " Rut he did n't use that gun ? " " No . " " Whoever killed the victim ran across the room , yanked  | down an arrow off the wall , and attacked the deceased with it ? " " That is our belief , yes . " " In fact , it 's your whole case , ai n't it ? " demanded H.M. , leaning across the desk . " It is a part of the case ; not the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I leave that up to my lord . " H.M. put his hands up to his wig ; he lifted one hand and patted the top of his wig with it , as though to cork himself before exploding to the ceiling . The witness 's dry , precise voice was never hurried : Inspector Mottram would not say more or less than what he meant . " Let 's take the missin ' piece of feather , " pursued H.M. in a gentle growl . " You did n't find it anywhere , did you ? " " No . " " Did you search the room thoroughly ? " " Very thoroughly . " " So it could n't ' a ' got away from you if it had been there , eh ? No ? You agree to that ? Where was it , then ? " Inspector Mottram came as near to a smile as the nature of the place would permit . He was watching H.M. warily out of those near-sighted eyes , for foolish testimony in the witness-box will break a police-officer ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That had occurred to us , sir , " he replied dryly . " Unless , of course , it was removed from the room by someone else ? " " Stop a bit , " said H.M. instantly . " Someone else ? But in that case it 'd have to be by one of the people who have already testified here ? " " Yes , I suppose it would . " " In which case , one of them witnesses was lying , was n't  | he ? And the case against the accused is partly built on lies ? " The inspector had begun to hit back . " You did not let me finish my answer . I said it only to exclude everything , sir ? as we have to do . " " Well , what were you goin ' to say ? " " I was going to say that it must have been carried out of the room in the prisoner 's clothes . He was wearing his over ( oat , a heavy overcoat . The piece of feather could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Which , " said H.M. , pointing , " makes it pretty certain it was torn off in a struggle ? " " Yes . " H.M. made a sign towards the solicitors ' table . He now seemed to radiate a sort of evil glee . " Inspector , you 're a pretty strong man , are n't you ? Powerful ? " " As strong as most , I suppose . " " Right . Now , look at what they 're holdin ' up to you . Do you know what it is ? It 's a feather  --  a goose feather . We got other kinds here too if you want ' em . I 'd like you to take that feather in your hands and tear it in half . Try to break it , twist it , pull it , rip it : do anything you like : but break it in half for us . " Inspector Mottram 's knuckly hands closed round the feather , and his shoulders lifted . He swung from one side to the other , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pened . " Havin ' trouble , son ? " said H.M. meekly . The other gave him a look from under jutting brows . " Lean across to the foreman of the jury , " pursued H.M. , raising his voice , " and have a try at it as though you were strugglin ' . Be careful ; do n't pull each other over the rail ... . Au , that 's got it ! "  | The foreman of the jury was a striking-looking man with a gray mustache but suspiciously vivid brown hair which was parted in the middle . The tug-of-war almost sent him out of the box like a fish on a line . But , when the feather eventually began to part , it shredded in long wisps and bits which not so much broke the feather as made it resemble a squashed spider . " In fact , " said H.M. , in the midst of a startled pause , " it ca n't be done like that , can it ? I use ' em for cleaning pipes , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrow that was used for the murder . See it ? The break is uneven , but it 's absolutely clean and there 's not a strand of the feather out of line . You see that ? " " I see it , " replied Mottram evenly . " Will you acknowledge now that the piece of feather could n't have been broken off like that in a struggle ? " ( " ; he was too honest to comment . He stood looking from the shredded pieces of the feather to H.M. , and shifted his feet . For the first time the prosecution had received a check . Whatever excitement might have been felt was doused by the cold sanity of Sir Walter Storm . " My lord , I suggest that my learned friend 's test is more spectacular than conclusive . May I see that feather which was used for the test ? " It was passed over to him , while he and H.M. nodded to each other . And now the prosecution was going to fight . So far they had experienced such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a rumbling noise in his throat . " If you got any doubts of it , Inspector , just try the same  | game on one of the other feathers in the arrow . . . . I repeat : will you acknowledge it could not have been broken off as you said it was ? " " I do n't know ; I ca n't say , " retorted Mottram honestly . " But you 're a strong man , and you could n't ? " " All the same ? " " Just keep to my questions . The feather was broken off : how was it broken off ? " " The guide feather in that arrow was old and  --  brittle , like . Dried up . So if ? " " How was it broken off ? " " I ca n't answer you , sir , if you do n't give me a chance to . I do n't suppose a feather is any irresistible force that ca n't be broken in two . " " Could you do it ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try it with one of those two remainin ' old and brittle feathers . Can you manage it ? No . All right . Now look at this . " He held up the crossbow . " Suppose you were fittin ' an arrow into this bow . You 'd put the guide-feather in the middle when you put the arrow into this groove . Would n't you ? " Mottram was a trifle rattled . " You might ; I ca n't say . " " I put it to you : you 'd shove this arrow back in the groove until it fitted against the projectin ' mechanism ? " " You might . " " And consequently , when you wound up the bow , I suggest to you that these teeth on the revolving drum would catch the end of the feather and grip it ? " " I do n't know anything about crossbows . " " But I 'm showin ' one to you . Here it is . Finally , " roared H.M. , before counsel could make any objection , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made in that feather  --  a clean break like the one there  --  was when the weight of a Toledo-steel catapult flew out and snapped it in two ! " He released the trigger of the crossbow . There was a vicious snap , and the cords banged across the head of the bow . " Where is that feather ? " inquired H.M. " Sir Henry , " said the judge , " you will please question : not argue . " " If yrludshippleases , " growled H.M. " I further take it that these questions have some rele-vancy ? " " We think so , " said H.M. , unmasking his batteries . " At the proper time we 're goin ' to produce the crossbow with which we 'll suggest that the crime was really committed . " An epidemic of creaking seemed to have afflicted the yellow furniture in the court . Someone coughed . Mr. Justice Bodkin remained looking steadily at H.M. for a short space ; then he peered back at his notes , and the pen in his plump hand continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as though startled and only half interested . H.M. turned back to Inspector Mottram , who was waiting quietly . " Take this arrow itself . You examined it as soon as you arrived at Grosvenor Street ? " " I did , " answered the inspector , clearing his throat . " You 've testified , too , that the dust on the arrow was n't smudged except where you found the fingerprints ? " " That is correct . " " Look at photograph number 3 in the book , and tell me if you were speakin ' the literal truth . What about that  | pretty thin vertical line that runs down the shaft of the arrow  --  blurred a little  --  where there 's no dust ? " " I said that there were no other marks in the dust . That was true . There never was any dust in the mark you refer to . That was where the arrow had hung against the wall , and accumulated no dust . Like the back of a picture hanging flat against the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , you say . Did you at any time see this arrow when it was hanging against the wall ? " " Naturally not . " " Oh ? But you heard the witness Dyer testify that this arrow did not hang flat and dead against the wall ; you heard him say it was set out a little on the staples ? " Pause . " I know from my own observation that the other two arrows were flat against the wall . " " Yes . They were two sides to a triangle ; they hadda be held upright and flat so that they 'd stay like that . But what about this one that was the base of the triangle ? " " I do not understand your question . " " Lemme put it like this . Two sides of that triangle were flat on the wall , hey ? The third side , the base , crossed the bases of the other two arrows . Consequently , it was supported against those arrows and was about a quarter of an inch or more out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " If my lord has admitted it as evidence , I accept it , yes . " " Exactly , " rumbled H.M. " But if it was a quarter of an inch out from the wall , it would n't be protected from dust , would it ? " " Not entirely . " " Not entirely ? You agree it was n't against the wall ? Yes .  | Then the whole shaft of that arrow would ' a ' been covered with dust , would n't it ? " " It is a difficult question . " " It is . And the whole shaft of the arrow was n't covered with dust , was it ? " " No . " " There was a thin vertical line smudged all the way down the shaft ? " " Yes . " " I put it to you , " said H.M. , holding out the crossbow , " that the only way a mark like that could ' a ' been caused would have been if it had been put into the groove of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbow , he drew one finger down the groove in the bow , looked so malevolently round the court that we could see his face , and then sat down . " Bah , " said H.M. There was a slight sign of released breath in the court . The old bear was not yet blind with blood , and he had made an impression . Inspector Mottram , a quite sincere witness , had been given a bad time . It had not shaken him unduly ; it had only solidified the lines of his jaw , and given him a look as though he wished for a give-and-take with claws on more equal terms ; but he seemed anxious to receive the Attorney-General 's questions in re-examination . " We have heard several times , " began Sir Walter abruptly , " about the only way ' a certain effect could have been produced . I call your attention to certain evidence in the photographs . It is clear to you that , when the arrow was snatched off the wall , it was jerked violently from left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir . "  | " Wrenched so violently that the staples were pulled out ? " " That is so . " " If you were making a motion like that , you would wrench and shake the arrow , and then pull it sideways ? " " Yes , that is what would be done . " " Consequently , you would pull the arrow along the wall ? and make a mark like the one indicated ? " " Yes , you would . " Mr. Justice Bodkin looked down over his spectacles . " There seems to be some confusion here , Sir Walter . According to my notes , there was first no dust at all . Now we hear that the dust might have been scraped off . Which of these two alternatives are you suggesting ? " " The matter is simple , my lord . Like my learned friend with his crossbow , I was illustrating . My learned friend insists on speaking of the only way a thing could have been clone . He can hardly object if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In your own home , I presume , there are pictures on the wall ? " " Pictures , sir ? Plenty of pictures . " " They do not hang absolutely flat against the wall , do they ? " " No , they have to be hung up . " " And yet , " said the other , glancing towards the women on the jury , " they accumulate practically no dust at the back of the frame ? " " Very little , I should say . " " Thank you . With regard to the only way  --  the only way in the world a feather can be torn in half , " counsel went on , with rich and sardonic politeness , " I understand that in preparing this case you acquired some information about archery ? "  | " I did . " " Yes . I believe that the guide-feather of an arrow  --  in this case , the one broken off  --  receives much more wear and tear than the others ? What I wish to suggest to you is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and is therefore more apt to be chafed and damaged by hand or bow-string ? " " That is so . They have often to be replaced . " " Is it impossible that in a struggle for this arrow between two men , one of them fighting for his life , the central feather should have been broken off ? " " Not at all impossible , I should say ; though I will ad-mit ? " " That is all , " snapped Sir Walter . He allowed an impressive pause while the witness left the box , and then turned to the judge . " That , my lord , with the accused 's statement , concludes the evidence for the Crown . " The worst was over . Despite this re-examination , there had been a very slight lessening of the case against the prisoner : more a feeling of wonder than anything else . But wonder is the beginning of the reasonable doubt . Under cover of the noise , Evelyn whispered excitedly . " Ken , H.M. is going to bring it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak . It sounded well , but it was weak ; he should n't have brought up that business about dust on the backs of pictures . Of course there 's dust on the backs of pictures  --  oodles of it . I was looking at the women on the jury , and I could tell what they were thinking . A little thing like that arrow would have been dust all over unless it had been absolutely flat on the wall . Ca n't you feel that they 're not certain at all now ? " " Ss-t ! Quiet ! "  | The judge was looking at the clock while the clerk 's sonorous voice rose : " Members of the jury , when the prisoner was before the magistrates , he was asked if he had anything to say in answer to the charge ; and , being told that he need not say anything , but that if he did it would be taken down in writing and used in evidence at his trial , he said , ' I plead not guilty to the charge made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . Through this charge I have lost everything in life that was of any value to me ; so c10 what you like ; but I am still not guilty . That is all I have to say . ' ? " If Sir Henry has no objection , " said Mr. Justice Bodkin briskly , " we will adjourn the court until tomorrow . " Bumping , shuffling , we all got to our feet as the judge rose . " All persons who have anything more to do before my Lords the King 's Justices of Oyer and Terminer , and general gaol delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court " ? the rain was pattering steadily on the glass roof ; it wzs the tired hour when you think of cocktails ? " may depart hence and give their attendance here again tomorrow , at ten-thirty o'clock . " God Save the King , and my Lords the King 's Justices . " Again the pause broke . The judge turned round , and went stumping along behind the bench at his brisk and pigeon-toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with lives and thoughts of their own , moving round hats and homes . Someone yawned audibly , and then a voice spoke suddenly with great distinctness . " Watch him , Joe ! " It came with a shock . We all turned round at the commo-  | tion in the dock . The two warders had sprung forward with their hands on the shoulders of the prisoner . Nearly at the trap leading down into the cells , Answell had turned round and walked swiftly towards the rail again . We heard his footsteps rap on that dance-floor which has been polished by the feet of so many now dead . But he did not attempt any action . He stood with his hands on the edge of the dock , and spoke with fierce clarity . To hear his voice was like hearing a deaf-and-dumb man speak . " What 's the use of going on with this ? That piece of feather broke off the arrow when I stabbed him . I killed the old swine , and I admit it ; so let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | IX " Red Robes Without Hurry " I F ANYBODY had asked me what would probably happen itt case of a commotion like this , I should have thought of every contingency except what really happened . We all looked at the judge , since the prisoner was speaking to him . By this time Mr. Justice Bodkin had nearly reached the door , at the right hand side behind the bench , by which he entered and left . For perhaps a tenth of a second his brisk step hesitated . For perhaps a tenth of a second he turned his head slightly , with a blank gaze of deafness and nonrecognition . Then his red robes  --  without any hurry  --  disappeared through the door , and it closed behind his tie-wig . Ile " had not heard " the words which the prisoner , with roe distinctness , was shouting across that void . So we did not hear them either . Like a room of mutes we bent to I ; a t her up our hats , our umbrellas , our parcels ; we shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pretended to say something to the person beside us . . . " My God , wo n't anybody listen to me ? Do n't you hear what I 'm saying ? You  --  listen  --  " The jury were going out in sheep-fashion , and not one of them looked round , except one scared woman who was touched on the arm by their  | guardian . " Please , for God 's sake listen to me ! I killed him ; I 'm admitting it ; I want you to ? " The soothing mutter of the warder droned . " All right , my lad ; all right ; down here ; easy does it ; take him easy , Joe  --  ee-easy ? " Answell stopped , and seemed to be looking from one warder to the other . Our glances did not go higher than the buttons of his waistcoat , yet you had an impression that he felt more trapped now than he had ever been before . His eyes looked hot and puzzled when they hauled him across to the trap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go  --  no ; wait a bit  --  I ? are n't they going to listen to me ? I admit it , d'ye hear ? " " Sure , my lad ; plenty of time ; e-easy there ; mind that step ? " We went out in good order , leaving a dead schoolroom full of yellow furniture , and we did not comment . Lollypop , looking white , made a sign to me which I interpreted as , " Downstairs " ; I could not see H.M. in the crowd . They began to switch out the lights . A sort of network of shuffling whispers caught us all together . Someone said in my ear , " ? and all over but the hanging . " " I know , " muttered another voice . " And yet , for a couple of seconds there , I almost thought ? " " That he might n't have done it ? " " I do n't know : not exactly : and yet ? " Outside Evelyn and I conferred . " They 're probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel so well . I say , I 've got to go , Ken . I promised Sylvia to be there at six-thirty . Are you coming ? " " No , I 've a message for H.M. Simply yes , ' from the Hume girl . I 'll wait . " Evelyn drew her fur coat closer . " I do n't want to stay now . Oh , blast it all , Ken ; why did we have to come here ? That  --  that cooks his goose , rather , does n't it ? " " Depends on whether it 's evidence , and apparently it is n't . " " Oh , evidence ? 1 " said Evelyn contemptuously . " Bother evidence ! What would you have felt if you had been on that jury ? That 's what counts . I wish we had n't come here ; I wish we 'd never even heard of the case . What is the girl like ? No , do n't tell me . I do n't want to know . That last business ? G'bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away into the rain , and I was left glowering in the crowd . People were scuttling like chickens at the door of the Old Bailey , though the rain had almost ceased . There was a now-we're-out-of-school look about it . A bitter wind whisked round the corner of the building , and the lines of gas-lamps in Newgate Street were palely solemn . Among the crush of cars waiting for their dignitaries I found H.M. 's closed Vauxhall ( not a certain Lanchester of weird memory ) , with his chauffeur Luigi . I leaned on the car and tried to smoke a cigarette against the wind . Memories were strong tonight . Up there , past St. Sepulchre 's church , ran Giltspur Street : off Giltspur Street was Plague Court , among whose ghosts H.M. and I had walked some years ago : and at that time there had been no thought of murder in James Caplon Answell 's mind . The crowd from the Old Bailey thinned slowly . After a general shooting of bolts had begun , a couple of City-of-London policemen  --  with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out and looked the situation over . H.M. was almost the last to leave . He came  |  | stumping out with his own unwieldly top hat stuck on the back of his head , his overcoat with the moth-eaten fur collar flying out behind ; and I could tell by the profane movements of his lips that he had been having a talk with Answell . He pushed me into the car . " Grub , " H.M. said succinctly . He added , " Oh , my eye , the young ass ! That 's torn it . " " So he 's really guilty after all ? " " Guilty ? No . Not him . He was only bein ' a decent young feller. ? I got to get him out of this , Ken , " said H.M. somberly . " He 's worth saving . " A passing car , as we turned into Newgate Street , merely brushed our mudguard ; and H.M. leaned out of the window and cursed with such resonance and imaginativeness that it was an index to his state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " he thought he 'd only got to come out and confess , and the judge would say , ' O.K. , son ; that 's enough ; take him out and string him up , ' ? straightaway , d'ye see . " " But why confess ? And , anyway , is it evidence ? " H.M. 's attitude towards this was much like Evelyn 's . " Of course it ai n't evidence . The point is the effect it 's goin ' to have , even if old Balmy Bodkin tells ' em to disregard it . I got great faith in Balmy , Ken .... But did I hear you thinking the worst is over when the Crown gets through with its evidence ? Son , our troubles have n't begun . It 's the crossexamination of Answell that I 'm dreadin ' . You ever hear Walt Storm cross-examine ? He takes ' em to pieces like a clock and then dares you to put all the little wheels back into place . I 'm not legally bound to put Answell into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to any comments Storm  | wants to make , and the story of this murder ca n't be complete unless I do put the feller there . What I 'm afraid of is that my own witness may go back on me . If he stands up there and swears what he just said a while ago  --  well , that will be evidence and the old man 's licked . " " But I repeat ( this damned court-room manner is getting infectious ) , why did Answell confess ? " H.M. grunted . He was sitting back against the cushions , his unwieldy top hat tilted over his eyes and his thick arms folded . " Because somebody 's communicated with him . I 'm not sure how , but I 'm pretty sure who . I mean Our Reginald . Did you notice how he and Reginald kept exchangin ' significant glances all afternoon ? But you do n't know Reginald . " " Yes , I met him this afternoon , at the Humes ' place . " A sharp little eye swung round towards me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 'd you think of him ? " " Well  --  all right . A little on the oh-really and supercilious side , but decent enough . " The eye turned back again . " Uh-huh . And , incidentally , what was the message from the gal ? " " She said to tell you yes , emphatically . " " Good gal , " said H.M. He stared at the glass partition from under the brim of his tilted hat . " It may work out well enough . I had some passable luck this afternoon , and also a few nasty jolts . The worst of the jolts was when Spencer Flume did n't turn up as a witness . I was countin ' on him : if I had any hair , it 'd ' a ' been grayer when I heard that . Burn me , I wonder if he 's turned tail ! I wonder ! " He considered . " People think I ai n't got any dignity . Fine spectacle it is , hey , of Lollypop and me running about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty work that ought to be done by solicitors ? Nice thing for a barrister , I ask you ? " " Frankly , " I said , " the real reason is that you would n't work with a solicitor , H.M. You 're too anxious to run the whole show yourself . " This , unfortunately , was so true that it provoked a fiendish outburst , especially as his grousing a moment ago indicated that he was worried about something else . " So that 's the thanks I get , is it ? That 's all the thanks I get ? After all the trouble I had runnin ' round that railway station like a porter ? " " What railway station ? " " Never mind what railway station , " said H.M. , checking himself abruptly in mid- ( light , and looking austere . But he was so pleased at having caused another point of mystification that he cooled off a little . " Humph . I say , Ken : on the evidence you 've heard today , what railway station would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How the subject of railway stations got into this conversation at all , " I said , " is not quite clear ; but is this a subtle way of hinting that Dr. Hume may have done a bunk ? " " He may have . Burn me , now , I wonder ? " For a moment he stared at the glass partition , and then he turned excitedly . " Did you by chance see Dr. Hume at their place this afternoon ? " " Yes , he was there , full of platitudes and benevolence . " " Did you follow my instructions about spreadin ' a little mysterious disquiet ? " " Yes , and I thought I succeeded remarkably well ; though what I said that was so effective I ca n't tell you . Anyway , he certainly told us he was going to testify this afternoon . He  | said he 'd put over a strong intimation that Answell is insane ; and , by the way , there was a mental specialist with him , a Dr. Tregannon ? " H.M : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outwards that it was as though he had attempted a balancingtrick with it . He is proud of that hat ; but he did not notice when it tumbled to the floor . " Tregannon ? " he repeated blankly . " Dr. Tregannon . Oh , Lord love a duck ! I wonder if I 'd better go round there ? " " I hope we 're not out to rescue any heroines , " I said . " Look here , what 's up ? Are you thinking of the sinister uncle again , or what he might do to Mary Hume for testifying on the side of the defense ? I thought of all that too ; but it 's rubbish . Plain cases , H.M. , and sticking closely to the Facts of Life : you do n't suppose he 'd hurt his own niece ? " H.M. reflected . " No , I do n't suppose he would , " he replied seriously . " But he 's fightin ' for his respectability . And psalm-singing Uncle Spencer may turn awful nasty if he discovers she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , now ! " " Is this allied with the secret and sinister connection between an ink-pad and a railway station and a Judas window and a golf-suit ? " " It is . But never mind . I suppose she 's all right , and what I want is grub . " It was some time before he got his wish . As the car drew up before H.M. 's house in Brook Street , a woman was mounting the steps . She wore a fur coat , and her hat was put on crookedly . Then she ran down the steps , rummaging in her handbag . We saw the eager blue eyes of Mary Hume : she was now breathless and on the edge of tears . " It 's all right , " she said . " We 've saved Jim . " H.M. 's face wore a rather ghoulish expression . " I do n't  | believe it , " he said . " Burn me , it ai n't possible for us to have any luck ! The blinkin ' awful cussedness of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a decent stroke of luck if ? " " But he has ! It 's Uncle Spencer . He 's run away , and he 's left me a letter , and it practically confesses ? " She was rummaging in her handbag , spilling a lipstick and a handkerchief out on the pavement . When she held out the letter , the wind took it out of her hand , and it was only with a flying catch that I retrieved it . " Inside , " said H.M. H.M. 's house is one of those ornate and chilly places which seem to exist only to give receptions , and most of the time is occupied only by H.M. and the servants : his wife and two daughters being usually in the south of France . Again as usual , he had forgotten his latch-key ; so he pounded on the door and shouted murderously until the butler came out and asked him if he wanted to get in . In a chilly back-library he seized the letter out of the girl 's hand and spread it out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notepaper closely written in a fine and unhurried hand . Monday , 2 P.M. DEAR MARY : By the time you receive this I shall be outward bound ; and it will , I think , be difficult for anyone to trace me . I can not help feeling bitter about this , for I have done nothing  --  absolutely nothing  --  of which I need be ashamed : on the contrary , I have tried to do you a good turn . But Tregannon suspects that Merrivale has got at Quigley , and will put him into the witness-box tomorrow ; and certain things I overheard at the house this afternoon lead me to the same belief .  | I do not wish you to think too hardly of your old uncle . Believe me , if I could have done the least good I should have spoken before . About certain parts of this business I am feeling rather wretched . I can tell you now that it was I who supplied the drug which went into Answell 's whisky . It is " brudine , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been experimenting at the hospital . " Wow ! " roared H.M. , bringing his fist down on the table . " This has got it , my wench . " Her eyes were searching his face . " You think that will clear him ? " " It 's half of what we want . Now be quiet , dammit ! " Its effects are almost instantaneous , and it ensures unconsciousness for a little under half an hour . Answell woke up a few minutes sooner than had been intended : probably due to the fact that he had to be propped up while the mint extract was poured down his throat to take away the smell of whisky . " Do you remember what Answell said himself ? " demanded H.M. " The first thing the feller noticed when he woke up was that there was an awful taste of mint in his mouth , and he seemed to have slobbered it a good deal . Ever since the Bartlett case there 's been arguments as to whether you could pour liquid down the throat of a sleepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make head or tail of it . " But who drugged him ? And why ? And what in blazes were they trying to do ? Either Avory Hume liked Answell or he hated him like poison : but which was it ? " I thought at the time that it was a mistake to load the whole decanter of whisky with the stuff , instead of merely  | putting it into a glass ; because it meant getting rid of the decanter afterwards . Believe me , Mary , the thought that someone afterwards might find the decanter has given me some horribly unpleasant moments . Finally , I arranged with Tregannon and Quigley to do what was to be done . That is the limit of my dereliction . It is not my fault that my well-meant efforts produced such unfortunate results . But you will see why I could not speak . At this point , as H.M. turned over the page , a strangled noise escaped him ; and then it became a groan . Our hopes went down with a clang like a broken lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should have been compelled to speak out and tell the truth . You must believe that . But , as I told you , even the truth would do him no good . He is guilty , my dear  --  guilty as hell . He killed your father in one of those rages for which his family has been noted for a long time , and I cheerfully let him go to the hangman rather than set him loose on you . Perhaps his protestations of innocence are quite sincere . He may not even know that he killed your father . " Brudine " is still a comparatively unknown quantity . It is quite harmless ; but , when its effect begins to wear off , it often leaves the patient with a partial gap in the memory . I know this will be terrible news for you , but please let me tell you what really happened . Answell thought that your father was drugging him and tricking him in some way . He knew that his drink was drugged as soon as he felt the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the first thing he remembered when he began to wake up  --  farther back than his own memory extends now . They had been talking , unfortunately , about killing people with arrows . He got that arrow and stabbed your father before poor Avory knew what was happening : that is how this dear fiance of yours came to be sitting up in the chair when his memory returned to him . He had just finished his work . Before God , Mary , this is what really happened . I saw it  | with my own eyes . Good-by , and bless you forever even if I do not see you again . Your affectionate uncle , SPENCER . H.M. put his hands up to his eyes and pressed his forehead . He lumbered up and down beside the table ; finally he sat down in a chair . The little worm of doubt was in all of us now . " But wo n't it ? ? " the girl cried . " Save him ? " asked H.M. , lifting a dull face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into court nothin ' in the world could save him . I 'm wondering if anything can save him now . Oh , my eye ! " " But could n't we cut off the last part of the letter and just show them the first part ? That 's what I thought of . " H.M. regarded her sourly . She was a very pretty piece , and very much more intelligent than this suggestion sounded . " No , we could n't , " he told her . " Not that I 'm above hocus-pocus ; but the blazin ' bad part of that letter is on the back of the sheet that tells about the drugged whisky . I lore 's proof  --  here 's evidence  --  and , burn me , we do n't dare use it ! Tell me something , my wench . In the face of that letter , do you still believe he 's innocent ? " " I most certainly . . . . Oh , I do n't know ! Yes . No . All I do know is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off somehow ! You 're not going back on me , are you ? " H.M. sat twiddling his thumbs over his paunch and staring at the floor . He sniffed . " Me ? Oh , no . I 'm a glutton for punishment , I am . They get the old man in a corner and whack him over the head with a club ; and every so often they 'll say , What , ai n't you  | unconscious yet ? Soak him another one ' ; and yet  --  burn me , why should that chap lie ? I mean your good old uncle . He admits it about the whisky . I was lookin ' forward , you see , to cross-examinin ' him today . I was all ready to tear him to pieces and show up the truth . I could ' a ' sworn he knew the truth , and even knew who the real murderer is . But here he is swearin' ' that Answell . . . " H.M. brooded . " I saw it with my own eyes . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curse it all , how could he have seen it with his own eyes ? He could n't . He was at the hospital when it happened . He 's got an alibi as big as a house ; we tested all that . He 's lyin ' ? but if I prove he 's lyin ' about that , the first part of the letter is n't worth firewood . We ca n't have it both ways . " " Even at this late date , " I said , " will you still keep from giving a hint as to how you mean to defend him ? What are you going to say when you get up there tomorrow ? What the devil is there to say ? " An expression of evil glee stole over H.M. 's face . " You do n't think the old man can be eloquent , do you ? " he inquired . " Just you watch me . I 'm goin ' to get up there and look ' em in the face , and I 'm goin ' to say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORD ; members of the jury . " With one hand behind his back , and his feet planted wide apart , H.M. was certainly looking them in the eye . But I could have wished that his manner was not so much that of a lion-tamer entering a cage with whip and pistol , or at least that he would abate his murderous glare at the jury . Courtroom Number One was packed . The rumor of sensational developments had been all over town : since seven o'clock in the morning there had been a queue outside the door to the public gallery up over our heads . Where there had been only a few newspapermen in attendance yesterday , today every paper in London seemed to have put a man in the somewhat inadequate space provided for the press . Before the sitting of the court , Lollypop had spent some time talking with the prisoner over the rail of the dock ; he looked shaken but composed , and ended by shrugging his shoulders wearily . This conversation appeared to interest the saturnine Captain Reginald Answell , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven when Sir Henry Merrivale rose to open the case for the defense . H.M. folded his arms . " Me lord ; members of the jury . You 're probably won  | derin ' what sort of defense we 're here to offer . Well , I 'll tell you , " said H.M. magnanimously . " First of all , we 'll try to show that not one single one of the statements made by the prosecution could possibly be true . " Sir Walter Storm rose with a dry cough . " My lord , the assertion is so breath-taking that I should like to be quite clear about it , " he said . " I presume my learned friend does not deny that the deceased is dead ? " " Ss-s-t ! " hissed Lollypop , as H.M. lifted both fists . " Well , Sir Henry ? " " No , melord , " said H.M. " We 'll concede that as bein ' the only thing the Attorney-General has been able to find out about this case unaided . We 'll also concede that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' any more personal comparisons between hyenas and ? " " The zoology of the matter does not concern us , " said Mr. Justice Bodkin , without batting an eyelid . " Proceed , Sir Henry . " " I beg your lordship 's pardon and withdraw the question , " said the Attorney-General gravely ; " submitting the accepted fact that hyenas do not howl : they merely laugh . " " Hyenas ? Where was I ? Ah , I got it . Members of the jury , " pursued H.M. , leaning his hands on the desk , " the Crown have presented their case to you on two counts . They 've said to you , ' If the prisoner did n't commit this crime , who did ? ' They 've also said , It 's true we ca n't show you any shadow of a motive for this crime ; but therefore the motive must have been a very powerful one . ' Both of those counts are pretty dangerous for you to go on . They 've based their case on a culprit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " Let 's take first this question of motive . You 're asked to  | believe that the prisoner went to Avory Flume 's house with a loaded gun in his pocket . Why ? Well , the police-officer in charge of the case says , People do not usually carry weapons unless they think they may have a use for them . ' In other words , you 're subtly asked to believe that the prisoner went there with the straight intention of murdering Avory Hume . But why ? As a prelude to married life , it 's a little drastic . And what prompted the feller to do that ? The only thing you 've heard is a telephone conversation  --  where , mind you , there was n't one bitter or flamin ' word spoken the whole time . Considerin ' what I have heard , I think it best that we should settle matters concerning my daughter . Can you manage to come to my house at six o'clock , ' and all the rest of it . Did he say to the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? ' He did not . He said it to a dead phone ; he said it to himself . All the prisoner heard  --  and all anyone says he heard  --  was a cold and formal voice invitin ' him to the house . And therefore , you 're asked to believe , therefore he grabbed up someone else 's gun and rushed round to the house with murder written all over his face . " Why ? The suggestion creeps in that the victim heard something pretty bad about the prisoner . You have n't heard what it was ; you 've heard only that they ca n't tell you what it was . They simply say , Where there 's smoke there must be some fire ' ; but you have n't even heard about any smoke . ' Ilhey ca n't supply any reason why Avory Hume suddenly seemed to act like a lunatic . " But , d'ye see , I can . " There was no doubt that he had caught his audience . He was speaking almost offhandedly , his fists on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , the actual physical facts in this case , are n't in  | doubt . It 's the causes for these facts that we 're goin ' to question . We 're goin ' to show you the real reason for the victim 's conduct : we 're goin ' to show you that it had nothing whatever to do with the prisoner : and we 're goin ' to suggest that the whole case against this man was a deliberate frameup from end to end . The Crown ca n't supply any motive for anybody 's actions ; we can . The Crown ca n't tell you what happened to a large piece of feather that mysteriously vanished ; we can . The Crown ca n't tell you how anyone except the prisoner could have committed the crime ; we will . " I said a minute ago that the case has been presented to you , If the prisoner did n't commit the crime , who did ? ' But you ca n't say to yourselves , ' It is very difficult to think that he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll have to acquit him . But I do n't mean to bother with merely provin ' a reasonable doubt of his guilt ; we mean to show that there 's no reasonable doubt of his innocence . Why , burn me ? " Lollypop warningly flourished that curious typewritten sheet as H.M. began to thrust out his neck . " All right , all right ! ? In other words , you 'll hear an alternative explanation . Now , it 's not my business to indicate who really committed this murder , if the prisoner did n't . That 's outside our inquiry . But I 'll show you two pieces of a feather , hidden in a place so obvious that nobody in this dazzlin ' investigation has thought of looking there ; and I 'll ask you where you really think the murderer was standin ' when Avory Hume was killed . You 've heard a whole lot of views and opinions . You 've heard all about the prisoner 's sinister leers and erratic conduct : first they tell you he 's so nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next he 's so coldly  | cynical that he smokes a cigarette : though why either of them acts should be suspicious is beyond my simple mind . You 've heard how first he was supposed to threaten Hume with murder , and then how Hume got up and bolted the door so that he could do it more conveniently . You 've heard what he might have done and what he probably did and what he never could have done in this broad green world ; and now , by the flaming horns o ' Tophet , it 's time you heard the truth. ? I call the prisoner . " While H.M. gobbled at a glass of water , one of the warders in the dock touched Answell 's arm . The door in the ( lock was unlocked , and he was led down through the well of the court . He walked nervously , without looking at the jury as he passed . His necktie was a little loose from much fingering ; and his hand would go up to it frequently . Again we had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was parted on one side ; he had good features which showed imagination and sensitiveness rather than a high intelligence ; and his only movement , aside from touching his tie or moving his big shoulders slightly , was to glance up at the roof of the witness-box . In this roof there is a concealed mirror  --  a relic of the ( lays when light was thus focused  --  and it seemed to fascinate him at times . His eyes looked a little sunken and completely fixed . Despite H.M. 's truculence  --  he was drinking water with the effect of gargling it  --  I knew he was worried . This was the turn of the case . During the time a prisoner is in the box ( usually more than an hour and sometimes a day ) he carries his fate in his mouth every second . It is a good man who will not falter before the pulverizing cross-examination that is waiting for him . IM.M. ' s manner was deceptively easy .  | " Now , son . Your name ? " " James Caplon Answell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very low tone , hardly audible , his voice flew off at a tangent . He cleared his throat a few times , turning his head away to do so , and then gave a hall-guilty glance at the judge . " You 've got no occupation , and you live at 23 Duke Street ? " " Yes . That is  --  I lived there . " " At about the end of December , last , did you become engaged to be married to Miss Mary Hume ? " " Yes . " " Where were you then ? " " At Mr. and Mrs. Stoneman 's house at Frawnend , in Sussex . " H.M. led him gently through the part about the letters , but it did not put him at his ease . " On the Friday  --  that 's January 3 ? did you decide to go up to town next day ? " " Yes . " " Why did you decide to do that ? " An indistinguishable mutter . " You will have to speak up , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are saying . " Answell looked round ; but the fixed , sunken expression of his eyes never altered . With some effort he found his voice , and seemed to catch up things in the middle of a sentence . " ? and I wanted to buy an engagement-ring . I had not got one yet . " " You wanted to buy an engagement-ring , " repeated H.M. , keeping his tone to an encouraging growl . " When did you decide to go ? I mean , what part of Friday d'jou decide this ? " " Late Friday night . "  | " Uh-huh . What made you think of this trip ? " " My cousin Reg was going up to town that evening , and he asked me whether he could get an engagement-ring for inc . " A long pause . " It was the first time I had thought of it . " Another long pause . " I suppose I should have thought of it sooner . " " Did you tell Miss Hume you were goin ' ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden and queer ghost of a smile which vanished immediately . " Did you know that on this Friday evening she had put through a telephone-call to her father in London ? " " No , I did not know it then . I learned it afterwards . " " Was it before or after this call that you decided to come to town next day ? " " Afterwards . " " Yes . What happened then ? " " Happened ? Oh , I see what you mean , " said the other , as though with relief . " She said she would write a note to her father , and she sat down and wrote one . " " Did you see this note ? " " Yes . " " In this note , did it mention what train you were takin ' in the morning ? " " Yes , the nine o'clock from Frawnend station . " " That 's about an hour and three-quarters ' run , ai n't it ? ' hereabouts ? " " Yes , on a fast train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did the note mention both the time of departure and the time of gettin ' there ? " " Yes , 10.45 at Victoria . It 's the train Mary herself always takes when she goes up . " " So he knew the train pretty well , eh ? "  | " He must have . " H.M. was allowing him plenty of time , and handling him with the softest of gloves . Answell , with the same fixed and sunken look , usually started off a sentence clearly , but allowed it to trail off . " What 'd you do after you got to London ? " " I  --  I went and bought a ring . And some other business . " " And after that ? " " I went to my flat . " " What time did you get there ? " " About twenty-five minutes past one . " " Was that when the deceased rang you up ? " " Yes , about one-thirty . " H.M. leaned forward , humping his shoulders and spreading out his big hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands began to tremble badly . He looked up at the edge of the roof over the box ; it was as though they were approaching some climax where wires must not be drawn too tightly or they would snap . " Now , you 've heard it testified that the deceased had already rung up your flat many times that mornin ' , without getting an answer ? " " Yes . " " In fact , he was ringin ' up that flat as early as nine o'clock in the morning ? " " Yes . " " You heard Dyer say that ? " " Yes . " " Uh-huh . But he must have known perfectly well he could n't get you , must n't he ? At nine o'clock you were just leavin ' Frawnend , on an hour and three-quarter journey . There were the times of arrival and departure smack in  | front of him , on a train his daughter frequently took . He must have known , must n't he , that it 'd be two hours before he could hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " ( " What on earth is the man doing ? " demanded Evelyn in my ear . " Pulling his own witness to pieces ? " ) " Now let 's take this phone conversation . What did the deceased say ? " Answell 's account was the same as the others ' . He had begun to speak with a terrible earnestness . " Was there anything in what the deceased said that you could take offense at ? " " No , no , nothing at all . " " What 'd you think of it , in general ? " " Well , he did not sound exactly friendly , but then some people are like that . I thought he was just being reserved . " " Was there any dark secret in your life that you thought he 'd discovered ? " " Not that I know of . I never thought of it . " " When you went along to see him that evenin ' , did you take your cousin 's gun with you ? " " I  --  did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the deceased 's house at ten minutes past six ? Yes . Now , we 've heard how you dropped your hat , and seemed in a temper , and refused to take your overcoat off . Son , what was the real reason for all that conduct ? " Mr. Justice Bodkin interposed during the prisoner 's quick mutter . " If you are to do yourself any good , you must speak up . What did you say ? I can not hear . " The prisoner turned towards him and made a baffled kind of gesture with his hands . " My lord , I wanted to make as good an impression as I  | could . " Pause . " Especially as he had not sounded  --  you ! know , cordial , over the phone . " Pause . " Then , when I went in , my hat slipped out of my hands . It made me mad , I did not want to look like ? " " Like a what ? What did you say ? " " Like a damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " repeated the judge without inflection . " Go on . " H.M. extended a hand . " I suppose young fellers calling on their in-laws for the first time often do feel just as you did ? What about the overcoat ? " " I did n't mean it . I did n't want to say it . But after I had said it I could not take it back , or it would have seemed worse . " " Worse ? " " More like an ass , " blurted the witness . " Very well . You were taken back to the deceased ? Yes . What was his manner towards you ? " " Reserved and  --  queer . " " Let 's make that clearer , son . Just what d' you mean , queer ? ' " " I do not know . " Pause . " Queer . " " Well , tell the jury what you said to each other . " " He noticed me looking at those arrows on the wall . I asked him if he was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the north when he was a boy , and how it was fashionable here in London . He said the arrows were trophies of what he called the ' annual wardmote ' of the Woodmen of Kent . He said , ' At those meets , whoever first hits the gold becomes Master Forester for the next year . ' "  | " The gold , ' " repeated H.M. in a rumbling voice . " The gold . ' What did he mean by that ? " " I asked him that , and he said he meant the center of the target . When he said this , he looked straight at me in an odd kind of way ? " " Explain that . Just take it easy , now .... " Again Answell gestured . " Well , as though he thought that I had come fortune-hunting . That is the impression I got . " " As though you 'd come fortune-huntin ' . But I s'pose , whatever else you could be called , you could n't be called a fortune-hunter ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " He looked at his fingers , and looked hard at me , and said , You could kill a man with one of those arrows : " " Yes ; after that ? " prodded H.M. gently . " I thought I had better change the subject . So I tried to be light about it , and I said , Well , sir , I did n't come here to steal the spoons , or to murder anyone unless it becomes absolutely necessary . ' " " Oh ? " roared H.M. " You used the expression , I did n't come here to steal the spoons , ' before you said the rest of it . We have n't heard that , y'know . You said that ? " " Yes . I know I said that first , because I was still thinking about the gold ' and wondering what he had in mind . It was only natural . " " I agree with you . And then ? " " I thought it was no good beating about the bush any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Hume , and what about it ? ' "  | H.M. took him slowly through the statement about pouring out the whisky . " I 'm goin ' to ask you to be very careful now . I want you to tell us just exactly what he said after he poured out that whisky : every look and gesture , mind , as far as you remember it . " " He said , May I wish you prosperity ? ' and his expression seemed to change , and become  --  I did not like it . He said , ' Mr. James Caplon Answell , ' to the air , as though he were repeating it . Then he looked at me and said , ' That marriage would be advantageous  --  to both sides , I might say . ' " H.M. 's lifted hand stopped him . " Just a minute . Be careful . He said , That marriage , ' did he ? He did n't say , ' This marriage ? ' " " No , he did not . " " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I have already given my consent to it . ' " " Let me repeat that , " interposed H.M. quickly . He lifted his blunt fingers and checked off the words . " What he actually said was , ' That marriage would be advantageous ; I have already given my consent to it ? ' " " Yes . " " I see . And then , son ? " " He said , I can find absolutely nothing against it . I had the honor to be acquainted with the late Lady Answell , and I know that your family financial position is sound . ' " " Wait again ! Did he say , ' Your financial position , ' or Your family financial position ? ' " " It was , ' Your family financial position . ' Then he said , ' Therefore I propose to tell you ? ' That was all I heard , distinctly . There was a drug in that whisky , and it got me. "  | H.M. exhaled a deep breath , and shook his gown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right here let 's cut back to the telephone conversation by which you got summoned to Grosvenor Street . The deceased knew you were comin ' to London by a train that left Frawnend at nine o'clock ? " " He must have . " " He also knew , did n't he , that the train would n't arrive until 10.45 ; and that he could n't possibly get in touch with you before eleven ? " " Mary told him so . " " Exactly . Yet still he kept ringin ' up your flat incessantly from as early as nine in the morning  --  when you had n't started from Frawnend ? " " Yes . " " When you talked to him over the phone at 1.30 on Saturday afternoon , had you ever heard his voice before , or seen him ? " " No . " " I want to hear about the beginnin ' of that conversation on the telephone . Just tell us how it began . " " The phone rang , " replied Answell in a calm voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was sitting on the couch , and I reached over after it while I was looking at a newspaper . Mr. Hume spoke . At that time I thought he said , ' I want to speak to Caplon Answell . ' So I said , ' Speaking . ' " H.M. leaned forward . " Oh ? You thought he said , I want to speak to Caplon Answell . ' But later , when you looked back on it , did you realize he said something different ? " " Yes , I did . I knew it must be . "  | " What did he really say , then ? " " Something different . " " Did he really say this : Did he really say , I want to speak to Captain Answell ? " " Yes . " H.M. dropped his brief on the desk . He folded his arms , and spoke with a ferocious gentleness . " In short , " said H.M. , " during that whole conversation , and afterwards at his own house , he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : did n't he ? "  | XI In Camera FOR perhaps ten seconds there was not so much as a whisper or a creak in the courtroom . I imagined I could hear people breathe . The implication penetrated slowly ; we had seen it suddenly appear and come closer ; but it had to be adjusted to the case , and I wondered whether the judge would allow it . The prisoner , whose tired face now wore a sardonic look , seemed challenging Reginald Answell to meet his eye . Reginald did not . His back was to the witness-box as he sat at the solicitors ' table ; he had his hand on the water-bottle , and he scarcely appeared to have heard . His saturnine face , with hair the same color as the prisoner 's , showed only a rather bored astonishment . " Yes , I mean that man there , " insisted H.M. , drawing attention to him . Captain Reginald shook his head and smiled contemptuously . Sir Walter Storm rose in full panoply . " My lord , " he snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authority on what Mr. Hume may or may not have been thinking ? " The judge considered , rubbing his temples lightly with his small hands . " The point is well taken , Sir Walter . At the same time ,  | if Sir Henry has any evidence to put forward in this matter , I think we may allow him some latitude . " He looked at H.M. with some sharpness . " Yes , my lord , we got the evidence . " " Then continue ; but remember that the prisoner 's suspicions are not evidence . " Although the Attorney-General sat down without attack , it was clear that he had declared war . H.M. turned again to Answell . " About this telephone-call which we 're trying to explain : your cousin had come up to London the night before , had n't he ? " " Yes , from the same place I was staying . " " And , when he was in London , he always stayed at your flat ? I think we 've heard that testified here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deceased wanted to get in touch with him , it 's natural that he should have rung up your flat as early as nine on Saturday morning ? " " Yes . " " When you went to Grosvenor Street on Saturday evenin ' , was your first name mentioned at any time ? " " No . I said to the butler , My name is Answell ' ; and , when he announced me , he said , The gentleman to see you , sir . ' " " So , when the deceased said , ' My dear Answell , I 'll settle your hash , damn you , ' you believe he was not speaking about you at all ? " " I am sure he was not . " I-I.M. shuffled with some papers in order to allow this to sink in . Then , beginning with the drinking of the whisky , he went through the story . We knew that part of it to be  | true ; but still , was he guilty ? The man was not the world 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about everything he said . He conveyed a little of that trapped feeling which must have possessed him if he were innocent . I t was a long examination , and Answell would have made a good impression if only  --  last evening  --  he had not announced his own guilt from the dock . It hung over every word he said now , even if nobody referred to it . He was a self-confessed murderer before he started . It was as though there were two of him , merging each into the other like figures on a double-exposed photographic plate . " Finally , " growled H.M. , " let 's take the reasons for various things . When did you first begin to believe that a mistake had been made , and that all that evening the deceased had been mistakin ' you for your cousin ? " " I do n't know . " Pause . " I thought of it that same night , later , but I could not believe it . " Pause . " Then I thought about it again . Afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say anything about it , even then ? " " I ? " Hesitation . " Just tell me : did you have a reason ? " ( Watch your step , H.M. ; for God 's sake watch your step ! ) " You have heard the question , " said the judge . " Answer it . " " My lord , I suppose I did . " Mr. Justice Bodkin frowned . " You either had a reason , or you had not ? " " I had a reason . " It was possible that H.M. was beginning to sweat . " Just tell me this : Do you know why the deceased might have  | wanted to make an appointment with your cousin and not you ? " Between counsel and prisoner there seemed to be a scales ; and now the scale-pan dipped . The young blockhead squared his shoulders and drew a deep breath . Putting his hands on the rail , he looked with a clear eye round the court . " No , I do n't know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But there was a reason , was n't there , why this mistake might have occurred ? " Silence . " There was a reason , was n't there , why the deceased may have disliked Captain Answell , and wished to settle his hash ? ' " Silence . " Was it because ? ? " " No , Sir Henry , " interposed the judge into that tightening strain , " we can not let you lead the witness any further . " H.M. bowed , and leaned his weight on his fists . He clearly saw that it was useless to go on with this . All sorts of speculations must have been buzzing soundlessly in the court , behind those impassive faces banked up round us . The first thing which occurred to me was that it almost certainly concerned Mary Hume . Suppose , for instance , that there had been an affair of striking proportions between Mary Hume and the penniless Captain Answell ? And suppose that the practical Avory Hume meant to cut it through to the core before it spoiled a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner have put his neck in a rope rather than acknowledge it ? This was incredible . Let us face it sensibly : it does not happen nowadays . It is carrying chivalry too far . There must be some other reason which  | concerned Mary Hume  --  but what it was none of us , I think , then guessed . When we did learn , we understood . Presently H.M. relinquished his witness , and the formidable Sir Walter Storm rose to cross-examine . For a moment he did not speak . Then in a tone of calm and detached contempt , he threw out one question . " Have you made up your mind whether or not you are guilty ? " There are certain tones you must not take with any man , even when he is helpless . What nothing else could do , this did . Answell pulled up his head . Across the well of the court he looked the Attorney-General in the eye . " That is like asking , Have you stopped cheating at poker ? ' " " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Answell . Just oblige me by answering my questions , " said the other . " Are you guilty or not guilty ? " " I did not do it . " " Very well . I take it that your hearing is normally acute ? " " Yes . " " If I say to you , Caplon Answell , ' and then , Captain Answell , ' ? even in spite of all the unfortunate noise going on in this court  --  you will be able to distinguish between the two ? " At the solicitors ' table Reginald Answell smiled slightly and turned his eyes round . What impression all this had made on him it was impossible to say . " Please speak up . I take it that you do not have periodic fits of deafness ? " " No . But as it happens , I did not pay much attention at the time . I was looking at a paper . I picked up the phone  | with the other hand , and I did not give it close attention until I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name well enough ? " " Yes . " " I have here your statement , exhibit 31 . Regarding this theory that the deceased may have said Captain Answell ' rather than Caplon Answell , ' ? did you mention this to the police ? " " No . " " Although you tell us that it occurred to you as early as the night of the murder ? " " I did not think seriously of it at the time . " " What made you think more seriously of it later ? " " Well  --  I got to thinking it over . " " Did you mention it when you were before the magis-trates ? " " No . " " What I am endeavoring to get at is this : When did such an idea first crystallize in your mind ? " " I do n't remember . " " What caused it to crystallize in your mind , then ? Do you remember that ? No ? In short , can you give one good and solid reason for this whole extraordinary notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted the witness , bedeviled out of his torpor . His face was flushed ; he looked , for the first time , natural and human . " Very well ; what reason ? " " I knew that Mary had been very friendly with Reg before we met ; it was Reg who introduced me to her , at the Stonemans ' ? " " Oh ? " inquired Sir Walter , with rich suavity . " Are you  | suggesting that you believed there had been anything improper in their relations ? " " No . Not exactly . That is ? " " Had you any reason to suspect anything improper in their relations ? " " No . " Sir Walter tilted back his head , and seemed to be massaging his face with one hand as though to get curious ideas in order . " Tell me , then , whether I correctly state the various suggestions you have made . Miss Hume was friendly with Captain Answell , there being nothing to which anyone could take exception . Because of this , the eminently reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolves suddenly to settle his hash . ' He telephones to Captain Answell , but the message is intercepted by you under the mistaken impression that it is for you . You go unarmed to Mr. Hume 's house , where he gives you a drink of drugged whisky in the belief that you are Captain Answell . While you are unconscious , someone places Captain Answell 's pistol in your pocket and ( as I think you have told my learned friend ) employs his time in pouring mintextract down your throat . When you awake , your fingerprints are found on an arrow which you have not touched , and the whisky has flown back into a decanter without fingerprints . Have I correctly stated your position in the matter ? Thank you . Can you reasonably expect the jury to believe it ? " There was a silence . Answell put his hands on his hips and glanced round the court . Then he spoke in a natural , offhand tone . He said : " So help me , by this time I do n't expect anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person does in life is governed by some reason , just try standing where I am for a while and see how you like listening to yourself . " A sharp rebuke from the bench cut him short ; but his nervousness had been conquered and the glazed fixity was gone from his eyes . " I see , " intoned Sir Walter imperturbably . " Do you next suggest that no reason governs any of your own actions ? " " I always thought it did . " " Did reason govern your actions on the night of January 4 ? " " Yes . I kept my mouth shut when they were talking to me as you are now . " It earned another reproof from the bench ; but Answell was making a better impression here than under chiefexamination . The good impression was quite irrational , for Sir Walter proceeded to tie him into such knots that probably not three people in court believed a word he said . But ? after he had let H.M. down badly  --  there it was . I wondered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did . " You have told us that the reason why you refused to remove your overcoat , and spoke to one witness in a tone that has been described as savage , was because you did not wish to look like a damned fool . ' Is that correct ? " " Yes . " " Did you think that you would look more like a damned fool with your overcoat off than with it on ? " " Yes . No . I mean ? " " What precisely did you mean ? " " It was the way I felt , that 's all . " " I put it to you that the reason why you did not remove  | that coat was that you did not wish anyone to notice the bulge of the pistol in your hip-pocket ? " " No , I never thought of that . " " You never thought of what ? Of the pistol in your pocket ? " " Yes . That is , there was no pistol in my pocket . " " Now , I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police on the night of January 4 . Are you aware that the suggestions you have made today directly contradict this statement you gave to the police ? " Answell drew back , fidgeting again with his tie . " No , I do not follow that . " " Let me read you a few of them , " said Sir Walter , with the same unruffled heaviness . " ' I went to his house , ' you say , at 6. io . He greeted me with complete friendliness . ' ? You now imply that his attitude was the reverse of friendly , do you not ? " " Yes , rather . " " Then which of these two attitudes do you wish us to believe ? " " Both of them . That is what I mean : I mean that on that night he took me for someone else , and his attitude was not friendly ; but he was actually friendly enough towards myself . " For a moment Sir Walter remained looking at the witness , and then he lowered his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to disentangle that ; I am afraid you do not appreciate my question . Whoever he thought you were that night , was his attitude during your interview friendly ? " " No. "  | " Ah , that is what I wished to find out . Then this particular assertion in your statement is false , is it not ? " " I thought it was true at the time . " " But you have completely changed your mind since then ? Very well . Again you tell us , ' He said that he would drink my health , and he gave his full consent to my marriage with Miss Hume . ' ? Since you have now decided that he was unfriendly , how do you reconcile this quoting of actual words with an unfriendly attitude ? " " I misunderstood him . " " In other words , " said the Attorney-General , spacing his words after a pause , " what you ask the jury to believe now is a direct contradiction to several of the most essential assertions in your statement ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Walter Storm gravely took the witness to pieces like a clock . He went through every bit of testimony with great care , and finally sat down after as pulverizing a result as I have ever listened to . It was expected that H.M. would re-examine , in an attempt to rehabilitate his witness . But he did not . All he said was : " Call Mary Hume . " A warder took Answell back to the dock , where the door was unlocked again , and he was led up into his open pen . A cup of water was brought up from the cells for him ; he drank it thirstily , but he peered up with a quick start over the rim when he heard H.M. call the witness . Where Mary Hume had been during the previous examination you could not tell . She seemed to appear in the middle of the court , as though there should be no hesitation or halt in the shuttle that moved witnesses to and from justice . Answell was already last minute 's pattern . And Reginald  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious as a start : only a certain awareness , as though someone had tapped him on the shoulder from behind , and he did not quite want to look round . His long-jawed good looks had a bonier quality ; but he assumed a pleasant expression , and his finger tapped slowly on the water-bottle . He glanced up at the prisoner  --  who smiled . Mary Hume looked momentarily at the back of Captain Reginald 's head as she went up into the witness-box . With the exception of Inspector Mottram , she was ( or so it seemed on the surface ) the calmest person who had yet testified . She wore sables : a flamboyant display , Evelyn assured me , but she may have been feeling in that mood with defiance . And she wore no hat . Her yellow hair , parted and drawn back sleekly , emphasized the essential softness and odd sensuality of the face , dominated by those wide-spaced blue eyes . Her method of putting her hands on the edge of the box was to grasp it with both arms extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her manner there was no longer any of that hard docility I had seen before . " You swear by Almighty God that the evidence you shall give ? " " Yes . " ( " She 's frightened to death , " whispered Evelyn . I pointed out that she gave no sign of it , but Evelyn only shook her head and nodded back again towards the witness . ) Whatever the truth might have been , her very presence there indicated thunder on the way . Even her importance seemed emphasized by the fact that she was rather small . A new interest quickened the press-box . H.M. , who had difficulty in getting his own voice clear , waited until the stir of interest had died down ; only the judge was unimpressed.  | " Hurrum ! Is your name Mary Elizabeth Hume ? " " Yes . " " You 're the only child of the deceased , and you live at 12 Grosvenor Street ? " " Yes , " she answered , nodding in a somnambulistic way . " At a Christmas house-party at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " D'ye love him , Miss Hume ? " " I love him very much , " she said , and her eyes flickered briefly . If it were possible to have a more hollow silence than had existed before , it held the court now . " You know he 's here accused of murderin ' your father ? " " Of course I know it . " " Now , ma'am  --  miss , I 'll ask you to look at this letter I have here . It 's dated , January 3 , 9.30 P.M. , ' the evening before the day of the murder . Will you tell the jury whether you wrote it ? " " Yes , I wrote it . " It was read aloud , and ran : DEAR FATHER : Jimmy has suddenly decided to come to London tomorrow morning , so I thought I had better tell you . He will take the train I usually travel by  --  you know it , nine o'clock here and a quarter to eleven at Victoria . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love , MARY . P.S. You will take care of that other matter , wo n't you ? " Do you know whether your father received this letter ? " " Yes , he did . As soon as I heard he was dead , I came to town , naturally ; and I took it out of his pocket the same night  --  the night he died , you know . " " What was the occasion of your writin ' it ? " " On Friday evening  --  that Friday evening , you know  --  Jim suddenly decided to go up to town , to get me an engagement-ring . " " Did you try to dissuade him , to keep him from goin ' to town ? " " Yes , but I could not do too much of it or he would have been suspicious . " " Why did you try to dissuade him ? " The witness moistened her lips . " Because his cousin , Captain Answell , you know , had gone up to London on Friday evening with the intention of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jim might meet at my father 's house . " " Did you have a reason why you did n't want them to meet at your father 's ? " " Yes , yes ! " " What was the reason ? " " A little before , in the same week , you know , " replied Mary Hume , " Captain Answell had asked me , or rather my father , to pay five thousand pounds hush-money. "  |  | XII " From a Find to a Check ? " " YOU mean that man there ? " asked H.M. , pointing with a big flipper and again ruthlessly singling him out . It was like an inexorable spotlight . Reginald Answell 's face had turned a curious color , a muddy color , and he sat bolt upright ; you could see the rise and fall of his chest . At that moment , looking back on past events , I saw the pattern take form . He had thought he was quite safe : he and this girl were linked together in such fashion that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had even promised him , with remarkably well simulated terror , that she would remain quiet . You could understand now the reason for that hard docility , the meek , " Thanks for everything . " A scrap of their conversation came back to me . First his significant " Fair exchange ; it 's all agreed , then ? " And her colorless , " You know me , Reg , " while she contemplated this . Three voices in the courtroom spoke in quick succession . The first was the Attorney-General 's : " Is Captain Answell on trial ? " The second was H.M. 's : " Not yet . " The third was the judge 's : " Proceed , Sir Henry . " H.M. turned back to the witness , whose plump and pretty  | face was composed , and who was looking at the back of Reginald 's head . " So Captain Answell had asked you , or rather your father , to pay five thousand pounds blackmail ? " " Yes . He knew I had n't got it , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of father . " " Uh-huh . What reason did he have for blackmailin ' you ? " " I had been his mistress . " " Yes , but was there another and stronger reason  --  much stronger ? " " Oh , yes . " For the second time during that trial , the prisoner sprang to his feet and was about to speak out from the dock . He had not expected this . H.M. made a savage gesture in his direction . " What was that other reason , Miss Hume ? " " Captain Answell had taken a lot of photographs of me . " " What kind o ' photographs ? " Her voice was blurred . " Without any clothes on , and in ? certain postures . " " I did not catch that , " said the judge . " Will you please speak up ? What did you say ? " " I said , " replied Mary Hume clearly , " without any clothes on , and in certain postures . " The calm inexorability of the judge made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Mr. Justice Bodkin . H.M. intervened . " My lord , just in order to show why the prisoner has been so blamed anxious not to talk about this , and why he 's acted in certain ways , I 've got one of those photographs here . Across the back of it is written , One of the best things she ever did for me , ' in what I 'd like the  | witness to identify as Captain Answell 's handwriting . Then I 'd like to submit it to you to suggest that it can go to the jury as bein ' evidence of what we 're trying to establish . " The photograph was handed up . While the judge looked at it , there was a hush of such bursting quality that you could hear it . It was to be wondered what the witness was feeling ; every eye in the room had glanced at her , just once , and had seen her in other costume  --  or the lack of it . Sir Walter Storm made no comment or objection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the judge tonelessly . It traveled along before two lines of impassive faces . " How many of these photographs are there ? " " A-about a dozen . " " This one here , the one you gave me to put in evidence : is it the only one of ' em you 've got ? " " Yes , Reg has the others . He promised to give me the rest if I did n't say anything in court about his trying to get hushmoney out of me . " Reginald Answell got slowly to his feet and began to make his way out of the courtroom . He tried to walk with equal slowness and casualness . No one , of course , attempted to comment or restrain him . But H.M. deliberately allowed a space while the pressure of the court was focused on him like his own camera . Chairs , people at the solicitors ' table , elbows , feet , everything seemed to get in his way , and made him go faster : it was like someone bumping over rows of feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention along a line of stalls . By the time he reached the door he was running . The policeman on duty there gave him one look , and stood aside . We heard the whish of the glass door out into the hall .  | " So , " observed H.M. in a heavy tone . " Let 's take up the story of those pictures . When were they taken ? " Again she moistened her lips . " A-about a year ago . " " Had you broken off your relations with Captain Answell before you met the prisoner ? " " Oh , my God , ages before . " " Did you ask for the photographs ? " " Yes , but he just laughed and said they would do no harm . " " What 'd Captain Answell do when he heard you were engaged to the prisoner ? " " He took me aside , and congratulated me . He said it was a really excellent thing , and he approved of it . " " What else ? " " He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the photographs to Jim . He said he did n't see why he should not get something out of this when everyone else seemed to have so much money . " " This was durin ' the week of December 28-January 4 ? " " That 's right . " " Now just go on , if you can , Miss Hume . " " I said he must be c-completely crazy , and he knew I had n't got five thousand pennies , and never would have them . He said yes , but my father would be willing to pay through the nose . He  --  he said that my father 's one big dream in life was to make a good and wealthy marriage for me , and ? " " And ? ? " " ? and had got to the point where my father  --  well , despaired of ever doing it ? " " Steady , ma'am ; stop a bit . Had you ever done anything like this before ? "  | " No , no , no ! I 'm only telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said my father would not let five thousand pounds stand in the way of my getting a good catch like Jim Answell . " H.M. studied her . " Your father was a pretty inflexible man , was n't he ? " " He was that . " " When he wanted something , he got it ? " " Yes , always . " " Did your father know anything about these photo-graphs ? " Her wide-spaced blue eyes opened as though she could not understand the stupidity that put such questions , even if they had to be asked for the sake of clearness in a court of law . " No , no , of course he did n't . Telling him was nearly as bad as ? " " But you did tell him , did n't you ? " " Yes , it had to be done , so I did , " replied the witness , summing herself up . " Explain how that happened , will you ? " " Well , Reg  --  Captain Answell said he would give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it was on the Wednesday , I wrote to him and said I had to see him about something horribly urgent and important in connection with my marriage . I knew that would bring him . I could n't leave the house-party without any explanation , especially as Jim was throwing money right and left to celebrate , and all the local charities were coming to thank us . So I asked my father if he would come down on Thursday morning and meet me in a village near Frawnend . . . " " Yes ; that 's right ; go on . "  | " I met him at an inn called The Blue Boar , I think it was , on the road to Chichester . I expected him to flare up , but he did n't . He just listened to me . He walked up and down the room a couple of times , with his hands behind his back , and then he said that five thousand pounds was absolutely ridiculous . He said he might have been willing to pay something smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact he had been looking forward a bit to Jim 's money . I said maybe Captain Answell would come down in the price . He said , ' We wo n't bother with paying him money ; just you leave him to me , and I 'll settle his hash . ' " " Oho ? Just you leave him to me , and I 'll settle his hash . ' What was he like when he said this ? How 'd he act ? " " He was as white as a sheet , and I think if he had had Reg there he would have killed him . " " H 'm , yes . So , " observed H.M. , jerking his thumb , " the idea of your father settling Captain Answell 's hash , and even giving him drugged whisky , do n't sound so almighty foolish as it did when my learned friend was discussin ' it , eh ? " He hurried on before anyone could object to unscrupulous comment . " Did he tell you how he meant to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going back to London , and he wanted a few hours to think . He said to let him know if Reg made any move in the meantime . " " Anything else ? " " Oh , yes ; he asked me to try to find out where Reg kept the photographs . " " Did you try ? " " Yes , and I was horribly poor at it . I  --  that 's what brought everything on . He just looked at me and laughed , and said ,  | So that 's the trick , is it ? Now just for that , my little lady , I 'm going straight to London and see your father . ' " " This was on Friday , was n't it ? " " Yes . " " What did you do ? " " I telephoned my father early Friday evening ? " " That 's the call we 've heard about ? " " Yes . To warn him , and ask him what he was going to do . " H.M. made mesmeric passes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said then ; every word , as far as you can remember . " " I 'll try . He said to me , Good ; it 's all arranged . I will get in touch with him tomorrow morning , and invite him here , and I promise you he will not bother us again . ' " She spoke with extraordinary intensity , so that H.M. allowed a space for the words to sink into the minds of the jury . Then he repeated them . " Did he tell you what he meant to do about settlin ' Captain Answell 's hash ? " " No ; I asked him , but he would not tell me . The only other thing he said was to ask where he could be certain of finding Reg , and I said at Jim 's flat . He said , Yes , I thought so ; I have already been there . ' " " He said that he had already been there . " H.M. raised his voice . " Did he say anything about pinchin ' Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effect of this was broken by the judge 's interruption . " The witness has already told you , Sir Henry , that she heard nothing more . " H.M. , well satisfied , patted his wig . " And then , on top of all this , " he went on , " your fiance all of a sudden decided  | to go to London as well , and you were afraid somethin ' would blow up ? " " Yes , I was half crazy . " " That 's why you wrote to your father on Friday night , after the phone-call ? " " Yes . " " Does this postscript here , You will take care of that other matter , wo n't you ? ' ? does that refer to the effective settling of Captain Answell 's hash ? " " Yes , of course . " " One more little point , " pursued H.M. , with a long and rumbling sniff . " A witness has testified here about the rather odd way your father acted when he got that letter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , and he announced in a grim kind o ' tone that your fiance was comin ' to town that day  --  and meant to see him . The witness said , ' Oh , then we will not go to Sussex after all ; we will invite him to dinner , ' or words to that effect . The deceased said that those other two would go to Sussex as arranged . He also said , ' We will not invite him to dinner , or anywhere else . ' " H.M. slapped his hand on the table . " What he meant was , then , that they would n't invite him to dinner in case the two cousins ran into each other ? " Sir Walter Storm stirred out of his immobility . " My lord , for the last time I must protest against this constant attempt to question witnesses about things they did not see or words they did not hear , particularly since it is always done in the form of a leading question . " " Do not answer that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said H.M. , after the customary form of sardonic apology , " in your opinion , from the things you have seen and the things you have heard , does n't what  | you 've just told us show what really did happen on the night of the murder ? " " Yes . " " Would a woman have the nerve to go through with what you 've just told us today , unless she believed absolutely that this man is innocent ? " He pretended to listen for an answer , and then sat down with a whack that shook the bench . There was some whispering behind us , around , beyond , a sound in long grasses which you knew centered in only one thing . Mary Hume must have known it as well ; she was drawing patterns with her finger on the edge of the ledge , and looking down . But from time to time she would glance up , briefly , while the Attorney-General was taking some while before beginning his cross-examination . Her pretty face was growing dull red ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer round her . How long this mental narcotic would sustain her you could not tell . She had badly damaged many parts of the prosecution 's case : you realized that much of Answell 's apparent stumbling and foolish testimony must be the solid truth : and it was clear the jury thought so too . But the whispering grew like noise in a forest . Someone inquired plaintively if they were not going to show us the photograph . I noticed that the space reserved for newspapermen was now completely empty , though I could not remember having seen any of them hurry out . It was a matter for headlines and speculations in every British home . " Hold on to your hat ; here we go , " whispered Evelyn fiercely , and Sir Walter Storm got up to cross-examine . Nothing could have exceeded the sympathy and consid-  | eration of the Attorney-General 's manner . His voice was quietly persuasive . " Believe me , Miss Hume , we quite appreciate your sincerity in this matter , and your courage in offering this somewhat unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation in posing , I believe , for a dozen of this nature ? " " Eleven . " " Very well ; eleven . " Again he waited for a time , pushing some books into an even line on the desk . " All these things to which you have testified , Miss Hume  --  I take it that you were aware of them at the time of the murder ? " " Yes . " " I believe you have stated that , when you learned of your father 's death , you hurried back from Sussex and arrived at the house on that same night ? " " Yes . " " Quite so , " remarked the other , meticulously pushing another book into line . " Yet you did not mention to the police , then or at any other time , the remarkable circumstances to which you have just testified ? " " No . " " Did you mention them to any other person ? " " Only to ? " Her slight gesture indicated H.M. " Are you aware , Miss Flume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and demonstrated to them that Captain Answell had attempted to blackmail you , it would not have been necessary to bring this photograph into court at all ? Or to expose yourself to any such humiliating examination as this must be ? " " Yes , I knew that . " " Oh , you knew that ? " inquired Sir Walter , quickening with interest and looking up from the book .  | " Yes , I  --  I read up on it . " " I presume this experience can not be pleasant for you ? " " No , it is not , " replied the girl . Her eyes looked strained . " Then why did you not mention it , and do the prisoner what good you could without bringing matters to this ? " " Was it because you believed the prisoner must be guilty ; and therefore that these photographs bore no relation to his actual guilt ? " H.M. got up with painful effort . " Appreciatin ' my learned friend 's consideration , we 'd still like to know what line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown  --  as we 've been suggesting all along  --  that a mistake was made between Caplon Answell and Captain Answell , and that the deceased got one in attemptin ' to settle the hash of the other ? " Sir Walter smiled . " Hardly . We accept the photograph as a fact ; we accept the suggestion that Captain Answell took the photograph ; but we shall be compelled to deny that these two points have any bearing on the matter at hand ? the guilt or innocence of the prisoner . " At my side , Evelyn nudged me sharply . " But surely they do n't dispute that now ? " Evelyn asked . " Why , it seems as plain as the sun to me . " I told her she was prejudiced . " Storm 's quite sincere : he believes Answell is a common-or-garden variety of murderer , wriggling in front of the facts . He 'll show that the girl is simply inventing lies to cover him : that there were goingson between Reginald and Mary Hume , but no attempt at blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last-minute effort to construct a defense . " " Well , it sounds silly to me . Do you believe that ? " " No ; but look at the two women on the jury . "  | Black looks from various directions brought us to silence while the Attorney-General proceeded . " Perhaps I did not make myself quite clear , " said Sir Walter . " Let me try again . All the things you tell us here today , you could have told at the very time of the prisoner 's arrest ? " " Yes . " " Would they not have been as valuable to him then as my learned friend wishes us to believe they are now ? " " I  --  I do n't know . " " Yet you did not mention them ? " " No . " " You preferred ( please excuse the term , Miss Hume , but I fear this is necessary ) you preferred to make a show of yourself here rather than to explain all this before ? " " That is a little strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must remind you that this is not a court of morals . We have suffered so much in the past from those who appear to have labored under this impression , that I feel constrained to mention it now . " The other bowed . " As you wish , my lord . I myself was under the impression that I remained well within the rights of cross-examination . . . . Miss Hume : you tell us that on Friday evening , January 3 , Captain Answell left Frawnend for London , in order to see your father on the following day ? " " Yes . " " For the purpose of extracting blackmail-money ? " " Yes . " " Why is it , then , that he did not see your father ? " The witness opened her mouth , and stopped . Fragile as she looked , she had been holding up well until now .  | " Let me make my question clearer . Several witnesses have testified here  --  have been pressed to do so , in fact , by my learned friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no messages , no phone calls , except those which have been indicated . Captain Answell did not come near him or attempt to communicate with him . How do you reconcile this with your statement that Captain Answell rushed off to London for the purpose you have declared ? " " I do n't know . " The other shot out his hand . " I put it to you , Miss Hume , that on Saturday the fourth Captain Answell was not even in London at all . " " But that ca n't be , I tell you ! " " Will you accept my suggestion , Miss Hume  --  which comes from the reports of police-officers who have investigated the movements of everyone connected with this affair  --  that on Friday evening Captain Answell left Frawnend , drove to visit friends in Rochester , and did not arrive in London until nearly midnight on Saturday ? " " No ! " " Will you further accept my suggestion that he announced to several persons in Frawnend his intention of going to Rochester : not London ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he were in Rochester he could not be in London ? " " Perhaps he lied to me . " " Perhaps he did . Let us take another aspect of it . These photographs , you tell us , were taken a year ago ? " " About that , maybe a little more . " " How long afterwards did you sever your relations with Captain Answell ? "  | " Not long ; a month or so ; not long . " " And during the entire course of the time afterwards , has he ever attempted to extort money from you ? " " No . " " Or to use these photographs as a threat in any way what-ever ? " " No . But did n't you see his face when he ran out of here ? " " That is not a matter which can come to our attention , Miss Hume . However , I can conjecture why the subject might be embarrassing to him for reasons quite apart from blackmail. ? Ca n't you ? " " Do not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen . " Counsel has just informed you that the matter can not come to your attention . " " You have told us , then , that all this time no suggestion of blackmail was ever made by Captain Answell ? " " Yes . " " Do you know the nature of an oath ? " " Certainly . " " I suggest to you that this entire account of Captain Answell 's blackmailing activities , and your father 's alleged wish to settle his hash , ' is an unfortunate fabrication from end to end ! " " No , no , no ! " Sir Walter contemplated her steadily and gently for a moment ; then he shook his head , lifted his shoulders , and sat down . If anyone expected H.M. to re-examine , that person was disappointed . With an almost weary air H.M. got up . " In order to establish this business once and for all , " H.M. said very distinctly , " call Dr , Peter Quigley. "  | I was certain that I had heard the name somewhere before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness . box was a stranger . He was a strong-featured Scotsman with a quiet manner but a voice whose every syllable was distinct . Though he could not have been more than in his early thirties , he gave the impression of being older . H.M. began in his usual off-hand manner . " What is your full name ? " " Peter Macdonald Quigley . " " Are you a graduate in medicine of Glasgow University , and have you a degree in scientific criminology from the University of Salzburg ? " " Yes . " " ' M. How were you employed durin ' the month of December io to January io , last ? " " I was employed as assistant to Dr. John Tregannon in Dr. Tregannon 's private nursing-home at Thames Ditton , Surrey . " " How did you come to be there ? " " I should explain , " answered Quigley , spacing his words , " that I am an agent of the International Medical Council , employed in England under the Commissioners in Lunacy , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ordinary way  --  against those practicing as mental specialists . " " Is the substance of what you are goin ' to tell us contained in your report to the British Medical Council ; and is it approved by that body ? " " It is . " " Were you acquainted with the deceased , Avory Hume ? " " I was . "  | " Can you tell us whether Captain Reginald Answell was attemptin ' to extort blackmail-money from the deceased ? " " To the best of my knowledge , he was . " " Yes . Now , will you tell us just what you know about this matter ? " " On Friday , January 3 , last ? " The witness 's first words were drowned by the stir in the court , and by Evelyn 's whisper . Here was a witness whose credibility they could not shake . With deadly leisureliness , H.M. was taking the Crown 's case to pieces . He let them cross-examine as long as they liked ; he did not re-examine ; and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swinging lines from the song , which H.M. had quoted , and which seemed less like a refrain than like a formula . " From a find to a check : from a check to a view : from a view to a kill in the morning . " " On Friday , January 3 , last ? "  | XIII " The Ink-pad Is the Key " BUT it was two o'clock in the afternoon , with the sensational testimony which had held the court beyond its morning sitting , before H.M. , Evelyn , and I sat again at lunch in the upper room of the Milton 's Head Tavern , Wood Street . Nearly all of the pattern in this business lay before us : and yet it did not . H.M. , a great Chinese image in the firelight , with a cigar stuck at an angle in his mouth , glowered and pushed his plate away . " Well , my fatheads . You see what happened now , do n't you ? " " Most of it , yes . The links in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Quigley ? " " By sittin ' and thinkin ' . Do you know why I took up this case to begin with ? " " Of course , " said Evelyn quite sincerely . " Because the girl came to you and burst into tears ; and you like to see the young folks have a good time . " " I expected that , " said H.M. with dignity . " Burn me , that 's the thanks I get from anyone ; that 's the view you take of a strong silent man who  --  bah ! Now listen to me , because I mean it , " and evidently he did believe in it so fiendishly that we listened . " I love to be a Corrector of Cussedness.  | You 've heard me talk a lot in the past about the blinkin ' awful cussedness of things in general , and I suppose you thought that was only my way of lettin ' off steam . But I meant it . Now , ordinarily , this cussedness is supposed to be funny . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste-paper basket all over the room . I mean that the one morning you 've got an important engagement is the one morning you miss the train . The one time you take your best girl out to dinner is the one time you call for the bill and find you 've left your wallet at home . But did it ever occur to you to think how that applies to whackingly serious matters too ? Just think back over your own life , and see whether most of the important things that happened to you were prompted by anybody 's effort to do malice , or anybody 's effort to do good , or , burn me , by anybody 's effort at all : but simply by the sinful , tearin ' cussedness of things in general . " I looked at him with some curiosity . He was smoking furiously  --  the outburst being produced , I think , by relief . His chief witness had left Sir Walter Storm flat , without a rebuttal in the Attorney-General 's nimble brain . " You do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " For if you think that things in general are all banded together in a conspiracy to administer a celestial kick in the pants , you might as well retire to Dorset and write novels . " " Y'see , " said H.M. , with ghoulish amusement , " that goes to show that the only sort of cussedness you can imagine is the kind that lands you in the soup . Like the Greek tragedies where the gods get a twist on some poor feller and he 's never got a chance . You want to say , Hey , fair play ! ? take a few wallops at him if you must , but do n't load the dice so far that the feller ca n't even go out in a London fog  | without comin ' home with sunstroke . ' No , son . Everything works both ways , especially cussedness . Cussedness got Answell into this affair , and the same sort of workin ' principle handed me the way to get him out of it . The point is that you 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Call the whole process by any fancy name you like : call it destiny or Mansoul or the flexibility of the unwritten Constitution : but it 's still cussedness . " Take this case , for instance , " he argued , pointing with his cigar . " As soon as that girl came to me , I saw what must have happened . You probably did too , when you heard the evidence . Jim Answell had got the wrong message and walked straight into the middle of a scheme designed to nobble Our Reginald . But neither Answell nor the Hume gal could realize that at first . They were too close to it ; you ca n't see a piece of grit in your own eye . They only knew the grit was there . But , when I sort of dragged the whole story out of her a month ago , and showed what must ' a ' happened , it was too late  --  the case was up for trial . If she had gone to ' em then , they would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely did n't believe her today . " He sniffed . " But what the blazes , I ask you , was the girl goin ' to think at first ? She hears her father is dead . She comes home . She finds her fiance alone with him in a space locked up like a strong-room , with his fingerprints on the arrow , and everything pointin ' straight to him . How is she goin ' to suspect a frame-up against him ? How is she goin ' to connect it with Our Reginald , unless someone points it out to her ? " " And that somebody was you ? " " Sure . That was the position when I first began to sit and  | think about the case . Of course , it was clear that old Avory IIwue himself had arranged that little bit of hocus-pocus with intent to receive Our Reginald . You heard it all . He kept ringin ' up the flat as early as nine in the morning ? s hough right in the middle of Answell 's original statement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't arrive until 10.45 . He gave the cook and the housemaid an unexpected night off . He ordered the shutters in the study to be closed , so that nothin ' could be seen . He called the butler 's attention to the fact that there was a full decanter of whisky and a full siphon on the sideboard . He bolted the door of the study on the inside , when Answell was alone with him . He sang out the words loud enough for the butler to hear , What 's wrong with you ? Have you gone mad ? ' That was a blunder . For , if you assume Answell really had drunk hocused whisky , no host in the world would ever naturally say , Have you gone mad ? ' when he saw a feller topplin ' into unconsciousness . He 'd say , Do n't you feel well ? ' or Are you ill ? ' or even , Drunk , hey ? ' " Granted , then , that Avory Hume was puttin ' up some game . What did he intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ; but he did n't mean to offer money . Do we know anything about Our Reginald that might give an indication ? I got it from the gal  --  as you tell me you overheard it today . Do n't we know , for instance , that there was insanity in Reginald 's branch of the family ? " For some time there had been in my mind a very vivid memory , of voices rising above the sound of feet shuffling down the stairs of the Old Bailey . Reginald Answell and Dr. Hume were descending together ; and between them there was thick hypocrisy for the common good , with an edge of malice showing through . Reginald Answell had made the  | thrust , as though casually : " There is insanity in our family , you know . Nothing much . Only like a touch of the tarbrush a few generations back ? " " But enough for the purpose , " commented H.M. " Oh , quite enough . I wonder what those two chaps were thinking about then ? Each of them knowin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to keep their mouths shut . In any case , let 's go on . There 's insanity in Reginald 's family . And Avory Hume 's brother is a doctor . And a very rummy kind of drug must have been required for the purpose . And one of Spencer Hume 's closest pals is a Dr. Tregannon , a mental specialist , who 's got a private nursing-home . And it takes two doctors to certify ? " " And so , as we know , they were going to lock Reginald up as a lunatic , " I said . H.M. wrinkled his forehead . " Well , there at the start , I was only considerin ' the evidence , " he pointed out , putting the cigar in his mouth and sucking at it in the fashion of a child sucking a peppermintstick . " But it looked probable that Avory and Spencer Hume had arranged just that game . Let 's see how the hocus. pocus would have worked out . It 's true they made a howlin ' error and got Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we found ' em ? Let 's see . " Reginald is to be invited to the house . Why might he , with insanity in his family , be presumed to go off his rocker ? That 's easy . He was known to be pretty well tied up with Mary Hume ; even Jim Answell knew that . " " Did he know about the photographs ? " inquired Evelyn , with interest . " Ho ho , " said H.M. " The photographs . No , he did n't know it at the time ; he knew it afterwards , in clink  --  because  | I told him . It caused me an awful lot of trouble . Jim Answcll is no posturin ' young hero who 'd rather walk fathcadedly to the rope rather than let it be known his gal had been havin ' an affair with another man . But that was n't it . When it came to the question of the pictures , he could n't ? he literally and physically could n't  --  say all that in court , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to save his life . Could you ? " " I do n't know , " I admitted , with visions which must have risen up before Answell . " The more you think about it the more devilish it sounds . " " She could , though , " said H.M. with great glee . " That 's why I like her : she 's a perfectly sincere and natural gal . A nosegay also goes to the judge . When Balmy Bodkin made that remark about this not bein ' a court of morals  --  burn me , I almost got up and handed him a box of cigars . Thirty years I 've been waitin ' for a red judge to acknowledge the facts of life without comment ; and I told you I had great faith in Balmy . But stop interruptin ' me , dammit ! I was telling you about the trick to nobble Our Reginald . " Where was I ? Ah , I got it . Well , it was known Reginald and Mary flume were tied up together . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Avory Hume had squashed to earth any possibility of marriage . And then his rich cousin James gets engaged to her . And Reginald comes to see the old man  --  and goes berserk . " You see the plan Avory had ? High words are overheard . Presently witnesses ( unprepared witnesses ) come chasin ' in . They find Reginald with his own gun in his pocket  --  suggestin ' violence . They find his fingerprints stamped on an arrow which has been so obviously ( so blinkin ' obviously ) ripped down from the wall  --  suggestin ' violence of a more  | than sane kind . They find his hair rumpled , his tie pulled out . They find Avory Hume with all the marks of a struggle on him . And what does Reginald himself say to all this , lookin ' wild and a little stupid as though he do n't know where he is ? He says he 's been given a drug , and all this is a frame-up . But here 's a medical man to swear there 's been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sideboard . Short of actually showin ' the chap with straws stuck in his hair , I do n't see what more could have been arranged . " Well , I thought to myself , what 'll be the watchword when he 's found ? It 'll be , Sh-h ! Hush ! Keep it dark ! This thing has got to be kept very quiet , known only to a few witnesses to prove it 's genuine . ' It must n't be known that the poor feller has lost his reason . The Commissioners in Lunacy must n't hear of it . Does the chap keep babblin ' something about Mary Hume , and some photographs , and a frame-up ? All the more reason why such slanderous ravings must n't be repeated , must n't even be breathed by a lunatic . Why not take him to Dr. Tregannon 's nursin ' home under the charge of Spencer Hume ? Even Jim Answell , when it 's necessary to break the sad news to him , will hush it up as fierce as anybody , On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it blared forth that a first-cousin of his had to be taken away under escort . " Of course , the doctors in charge of the case will also take charge of his personal belongings : clothes , keys , and the like . Wherever he 's got those photographs stowed away , they 'll be found and burnt in pretty quick time . " H.M. snapped his fingers , and then sniffed . " And that 's all there is to it , my fatheads . It ai n't even very expensive . Our Reginald will remain under duress until he promises to be  | good  --  and serve him right ! It 's an awful pity the scheme did n't work . Even if he wo n't promise , he ca n't prove anyt h mg and he is still always suspect of a leaky steeple ; and Avory Hume 's daughter is married . It 's happened many times before , y'know . It 's the respectable way of hushin ' up tit a tidal . " We considered it , more detailed than it had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Avory Hume , " I said , " was apparently a tough proposition . " H.M. blinked in the firelight of the old room , surprised . " Not particularly , son . He was simply respectable . Also , he was a realist . Someone was blackmailing him . Something had to be done about it . And so he did . You heard the lather 's daughter talkin ' in court this afternoon . I do n't mind his sort . As I say , in this amusin ' little spectacle of clog-eat-dog , I 'm rather sorry his scheme did n't come off , and shove our cool Reginald into cooler clink while he reflects that there are ways and ways of gettin ' money . But I 'm an old-fashioned lawyer , Ken , and a whole canine feast ai n't goin ' to let ' em hang my client . Well , right there at the start , I had to dig up a witness who knew somethin ' about the scheme . If necessary , I was prepared to bribe Tregannon himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . But I got Quigley , because the Medical Council had already been after Tregannon . There was someone who actually overheard Avory and Spencer and Tregannon cookin ' up the broth : someone planted in Tregannon 's nursing-home , and waitin ' for an opportunity to expose Tregannon . That was what I meant , a while ago , by speakin ' of the cussedness which cuts the other way . "  | " But what 's the line of defense now ? " " Ad " said H.M. , and scowled . " You 've practically established that there was a plot . But will Storm throw up his brief just because of that ? Is there any reason why Answell still should n't be guilty ? " " No , " said H.M. " That 's what 's got me worried . " He pushed back his chair , lumbered up , and took a few pigeon-toed turns up and down the room . " So what 's the line of defense now ? " " The Judas window , " said H.M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! " he went on persuasively . " Just you look at the evidence , and take it from the beginning as I did . Now that we 've established a plot , there 'll be a whole heap of helpful suggestions in the way that plot was worked out . I 'll give you a hint . One thing in this scheme bothered me a bit . Avory and Spencer are workin ' together to nobble Reginald  --  very well . But , on the night of the trick , Avory manages to get everybody out of the house except the butler . The cook and the maid are out . Amelia Jordan and Dr. Hume are goin ' off to Sussex . But I said to myself , Here ! Spencer ca n't be going away like that . His brother needs him . Who 's goin ' to come in and cluck his tongue over the bogus loony : who 's goin ' to examine the loony : who 's goin ' to swear he took no drug , if not Dr. Hume ? He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Unless they got Tregannon . " " Yes ; but they 'd hardly have Tregannon on the premises . It would look much too fishy . And there was the answer to the other question . If Spencer himself were too conveniently hangin ' about with his stethoscope , if the whole thing flowed too smoothly , an eyebrow might be raised here and  | there . It was the Jordan woman , in all accident , who gave the hint away when she was burblin ' in court yesterday : I heard her testimony a month ago , and I spotted it then . Remember what she was to do ? She was to pick up Spencer in the car  --  pick him up at the hospital  --  and they were to drive into the country afterwards . Do you recall that ? " " Yes . What of it ? " " Do you also recall , " said H.M. , opening his eyes , " what Spencer had asked her to do for him ? He 'd asked her to pack a suitcase for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't have to bother . And , burn me , I do n't recall a neater trick ! She intended to go to Sussex ; Spencer never did . The one way in this world you can be sure you wo n't get what you want is to tell someone , offhand , to pack a suitcase for you . The person does his best , and shoves in what he thinks you 'll need . But something is always wrong . In this case , all Spencer needed was a pretext . She was to arrive at the hospital luggin ' the suitcase . Ah , ' says Spencer affably , I see you 've packed it . Did you put in my silverbacked brushes ? ' Or it may be his dressing-gown , or his evenin ' studs , or anything at all : all he 's got to do is wade through the list until he finds something that 's been omitted . You left that out ? ' he says . Good God , woman , do you think I can travel to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a most unfortunate nuisance ' ? ca n't you hear Spencer sayin ' that ? ? ' but I am afraid we shall have to go back to the house for it . ' " H.M. , patting his stomach and leering clown from under lofty eyebrows , was giving such an uncanny impersonation of Spencer Hume that you could almost hear the doctor 's voice . Then he broke off . He added :  | " So they drive back to the house . And they arrive ( accidentally but providentially ) just in time to find Avory Hume overcoming a maniac who has tried to kill him . Hey ? " There was a pause . " It 's rather a neat trick , and it would have been convincing , " Evelyn admitted . " Was the woman  --  Amelia Jordan ? in on the scheme to nail Reginald ? " " No . Otherwise there 'd ' a ' been no reason for the hocuspocus . She was to be one of the unprepared witnesses . The other two were Dyer and Fleming ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , H.M. , with a very sour expression , sat down at the table again . " Look here ! You heard what Fleming said in the witness-box . Avory had told him to drop in at the house about a quarter to seven . Hey ? All right . With Fleming 's habits , he may even suspect that Fleming 'll be a few minutes early . Now concentrate on the elegant timing of the whole business , as it was meant to happen . " Avory has told the prospective loony to come to the house at six o'clock sharp ; and , considerin ' an errand of blackmail , he can ruddy well believe Reginald will be on time . Avory has told Amelia Jordan that she 's to start off in the car ( which Dyer will bring round from the garage ) at soon after 6.15 . Gim me a piece of paper , somebody , and a pencil . Avory Hume was awful methodical , and he worked out this piece of crooked work as methodically as he 'd have worked out the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. , Reginald will arrive . He will be seen by Jordan and Dyer . Dyer takes him to the study . Then Dyer will be sent to fetch the car . Dyer will probably linger at  | the study door for a couple of minutes ; he 's been warned the visitor is not to be trusted , remember . Dyer will leave the house , say 6.05 . He should be back with the car between 6. io and 6.15 . Between 6.15 and 6.2o , Amelia Jordan will be drivin ' away in it to the hospital . " It 's only a short drive from Grosvenor Street to Praed Street , near Paddington . Amelia Jordan arrives at the hospital , say 6.22 . She will hand the suitcase to Spencer , who will discover that his whatever-it-is is missin ' , and they will drive back . They will arrive back between 6.27 and 6.3o . " By this time the stage is all set . Avory Hume will cut up a row  --  bring Dyer bangin ' at the door  --  open the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reginald , groggy and wild-eyed with the inertia that follows a maniacal outburst , wo n't be able to say much . The doctor will arrive , clucking his tongue . While the excitement is still high and handsome , Fleming will arrive and be the last witness . So . " H.M. puffed out smoke and waved it away . " Only it did n't work out like that , " I said . " Someone took advantage of that scheme  --  and murdered the old man . " " That 's it . Now I 've told you what was meant to happen . Next , to help you along , I 'll show you what did happen . I 'm goin ' to give you a time-table for that whole evening , because it 's very suggestive . Most of the official times , like the arrival of officers or the times centerin ' directly round the fact of the murder , you 've already heard in court . Others were n't important as direct evidence , and were n't stressed . But I 've got ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I 've got the comments I wrote opposite ' em after I 'd interviewed Answell and Mary Hume . I suggest to you ( gor , how I 'm beginnin ' to hate that expression ! ) that , if you  | study ' em with a little cerebral activity , you 'll learn a good deal . " From his inside pocket he took out a large , grubby sheet of paper , worn from much pawing-over , and spread it out carefully . It was dated over a month before . The timeschedule , in the left-hand column , had evidently been typed by Lollypop . The comments , in the other column , were scrawled in blue pencil by H.M. Thus :  | At this point Evelyn interposed . " I say ! Does this mean , in actual times , that it was only nine minutes between the time they went into the room and the time Dyer went out to get the policeman ? By the way they talked in court , it sounded much longer , somehow . " H.M. grunted sourly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got so much to tell . But there 's the actual record , as you could ' a ' worked it out for yourselves . " " The one thing that 's most puzzling here , " I insisted , " is why so much rumpus in general is being kicked up on the subject of ink-pads . Ink-pads would seem to have nothing to do with the case . What difference does it make whether Fleming did or did n't take Answell 's fingerprints ? The police could always do it , and match them with the ones on the arrow . Yet even the prosecution made a point of bringing it up and hammering it home . " Exhaling a cloud of smoke , H.M. leaned back with rich satisfaction and closed one eye to avoid getting smoke in it . " Sure they did , Ken . But they were n't concerned with inkpads . What they wanted to hammer was that , when Fleming tried to get Answell 's fingerprints , Answell  --  far from bein ' torpid  --  flared out murderously and threw Fleming clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched on the  | deceased , d'ye see . But I 'm glad they brought it up ; if they had n't , I should have . Because I am most definitely interested in one particular ink-pad . It 's pretty well the key to the whole business . You see that , do n't you ? "  | THAT argument , up in the little low-raftered room at the Milton 's Head , while we waited for the afternoon session of the court , will always remain a kind of vignette as vivid as anything in the case . The firelight shone on rows of pewter tankards , and on H.M. 's enormous shoes , and on his glasses , and on a face wreathed with fantastic jollity . Evelyn sat with her legs crossed , leaning forward with her chin in her hand ; and her hazel eyes had that amused annoyance which H.M. inspires in every woman . " You know perfectly well we do n't , " she said . " Now do n't sit there chortling and rocking and making faces like Tony Weller thinking what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times you can be the most utterly exasperating man who ever  --  ee ! Why do you take such pleasure in mystifying people ? If only Mr. Masters were here , the party would be complete , would n't it ? " " I do n't take pleasure in it , dammitl " grumbled H.M. , and quite seriously believed this . " It 's only that people take such unholy joy in doin ' me in the eye , that I got to get a bit of my own back . " He was soothing . " You stick to business , here . Read the rest of the time-table . I 'm merely askin ' you : if Jim Answell is n't the murderer , who is ? "  | " No , thanks , " said Evelyn . " I 've been had like that belore . And much too often . You did it in France , and you did it in Devon . You parade out a list of suspects , and we take our choice ; and then it always turns out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case you 'll show the murder was really committed by Sir Walter Storm or the judge . No , thanks . " " Meanin ' what ? " inquired H.M. , looking at her over his spectacles . " Meaning this . You 've called our attention to this timetable , and that 's a most awfully suspicious sign . You seem to concentrate attention on people who were actually lurking about the place at the time of the murder . But what about the others ? " " What others ? " " There are at least three others . I mean Reginald Answell , and even Mary Hume herself , and Dr. Hume . For instance , the Attorney-General put it to ' the Hume girl today that Reginald was n't in London at all : he was in Rochester : and did n't reach London until nearly midnight . You did n't contradict him  --  at least , you did n't re-examine the witness . Well , where was he ? We know he was at that house at some time on the night of the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so himself , when he was going down the stairs at the Old Bailey . Mary Hume was also there , also late . Finally , there 's the doctor , who 's missing now . First you rather indicate that Dr. Hume has got an alibi ; and last night , Ken tells me , he writes a letter swearing he actually saw the murder committed . How do you propose to straighten out all that ? " " If you 'd only read the rest of your time-table ? " howled H.M. , and then grew reflective . " Some of it 's worryin ' me , "  | he admitted . " You knew , did you , that there 's a court order out to arrest Spencer ? When we knew he 'd run off , Balmy Bodkin would n't let that pass . If they ketch him , Balmy 'll commit him to clink for deliberate contempt of court in a murder case . I thought Walt Storm rather too easily decided to dispense with that witness , when he should ' a ' moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunk . But so did Balmy . Burn me , I wonder .. . never mind . Have you got any ideas , Ken ? " My position was simple . " Not having much sense of social justice , I do n't care so much who killed him as how it was done . I 'm like Masters : Never mind the motive ; let 's hear about the mechanics . ' There are three alternatives : ( 1 ) Ans. well really did stab him after all ; ( 2 ) Hume killed himself , either by accident or suicide ; ( 3 ) there 's an unknown murderer and an unknown method . H.M. , will you answer a couple of straight questions , without technical evasions or double-meanings ? " His face smoothed itself out . " Sure , son . Fire away . " " According to you , the real murderer made his entrance by means of the Judas window . Is that straight ? " " Yes . " " And the murder was committed with a crossbow . Is that your argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , why a crossbow ? " H.M. considered . " It was the logical thing , Ken ; it was the only weapon that fitted the crime . Also , it was much the easiest weapon to use . " " The easiest weapon ? That whacking big clumsy thing you showed us ? "  | " Easy , " said H.M. sharply . " Not in the least big , son . Very broad , yes ; remember that ; but not long . You saw it yourself : it was the short stump ' crossbow . And easy ? At a very short distance , you heard Fleming admit himself , not even an amateur could miss . " " I was coming to that . From what distance was the arrow fired ? " H.M. regarded us over his spectacles with a kind of sour whimsicality . " The courtroom manner is gettin ' infectious . I feel like a medical man said at one trial , " This is like a college examination under oath . ' That , Ken , is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches , since you want me to be so goddam precise . But , just in case I 'm accused of evasion , I 'll tell you this  --  not much more than three feet , at the very longest . Satisfied ? " " Not quite . A , Vhat was Hume 's position when the arrow was fired ? " " The murderer was talkin ' to him . Hume had been by the desk , bendin ' over to look at something . As he bent forward , the murderer casually pulled the trigger of the crossbow : hence the rummy angle of the arrow , which was shot in rather a straight line. ? Walt Storm made an awful lot of fun of that , but it 's the strict truth . " " Bending over to look at something ? " " That 's right . " Evelyn and I looked at each other . H.M. , nibbling at the stump of his cigar , pushed the time-table across to me . " Now that you 've got that off your chest , why not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer Hume , for instance . He 's a gap in the proceedings , because he did n't testify in court . Not that he did much of importance when he got back to the house ; but what he did is inter- " I remember reading about another of these cases , " I said ; " but it 's so long ago that I ca n't remember whether it was a real happening or a story . A man was found appar , ently murdered in a room high up in a tower by the edge of the sea . His chest had been blown in with a shot-gun , and the weapon was missing . The only clew was a fishing-rod in the room . Unfortunately , the door of the tower had been under observation , and no one was seen to go in or out . The only window was a small one up a smooth wall above the sea . Who killed him , and what had happened to the weapon ? . . . The secret was fairly simple . It was suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the window . He stood some feet away and touched the hair-trigger with the fishing-rod . The kick of the gun when it exploded carried it backwards off the window-ledge into the sea : hence it was supposed to be murder and his family collected the insurance . Do you mean that there might have been some device in Avory Hume 's study , which he accidentally touched , and it discharged the arrow at him ? Or what the devil do you mean ? " " It ca n't be that , " Evelyn protested . " If this is n't more mystification , we 're to believe that the murderer was actually talking to Hume at the time . " " That 's right , " admitted H.M. " All the same , " I said , " it seems that we 're straying away from the most important point . No matter who committed the murder , what was the motive ? You ca n't tell me , for instance , that Answell would grab an arrow and stab Hume simply because he believed his future father-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , he 's as mad as they wanted to make out Reginald was . But  |  | there 's been remarkably little talk about motive in this case . Who else had a shadow of a motive to kill Hume ? " " Ai n't you forgettin ' the will ? " asked H.M. , lifting dull eyes . " What will ? " " You heard all about it in court . Avory Hume was mad to have a grandson , like most self-made men . Perpetuate the line , and so on . He was goin ' to make a will leaving everything in trust  --  everything , mind  --  for that hypothetical grandson . " " Did he make the will ? " " No . He did n't have time . So I thought it might be interestin ' to go to Somerset House and put down my shilling and get a look at the original will , the one that 's been admitted to probate now . Well , the girl is the chief legatee , of course ; but everybody else gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't even cautious over things like that . Even poor old Dyer got a cut , and there was a sizable bequest of ? 3,500 to build a new ward-house for the Woodmen of Kent , to be delivered to the Secretary and used at his own discretion ... " " So the Woodmen of Kent got together and marched up to London and skewered him with an arrow ? Rubbish , H.M. ! That 's not worthy of you . " " I was only throwin ' out suggestions , " returned H.M. with surprising meekness . He peered up from under wrinkled brows . " Just to see if anything could possibly stir up your gray matter . You 'd never be able to construct a defense , Ken : you ca n't take a hint out of the evidence , and go straight to where you 'd probably find a witness . For instance ! Suppose I thought it was pretty vital to get hold of Uncle Spencer : even if I did n't shove him into the witness-  | box , suppose I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How would I go about puttin ' my hands on him ? " " God knows . That 's one of Masters 's favorite jobs of routine . If the police ca n't find him , I do n't see how you can . He got a good head-start , remember . He could be in Palestine by now . " A knock at the door roused H.M. out of his apparent torpor . He dropped the stump of his cigar into the plate , and squared himself . " Come in , " said H.M. " He could be , " H.M. added , " but he 's not . " The door was opened with some caution . And Dr. Spencer Hume , impeccably dressed , with a bowler hat in one hand and a rolled umbrella hanging from the crook of his arm , came into the room .  | XV " The Shape of the Judas Window IF THE gilded figure of Justice on the dome of the Old Bailey had slid down from the cupola and appeared here , it could have caused no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bland and banal . He looked ill . Though his dark hair was as neatly brushed into place as before , his high color had gone and his little , sensitive eyes were uneasy . When he saw Evelyn and me sitting in the firelight , he shied badly . " It 's all right , son , " H.M. assured him . H.M. was sitting back at the table , one hand shading his eyes . The doctor 's glance had gone instinctively towards the window , in the direction of the great building where he was wanted . " These are friends of mine . One of ' em I think you met yesterday . Just sit down and smoke a cigar . There 's a very old artillery proverb , The closer the target , the safer you are . ' Bein ' right smack up against the eye of Balmy Bodkin , you 're all right . You could get in the queue outside the public gallery entrance , and go up in the gallery among the spectators , and you could sit right up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer than China . " " I  --  ah  --  am aware of that , " replied Spencer , with traces of a bitter smile . He sat very straight in the chair , and his  | tubby figure had an odd dignity . He did not accept H.M. 's offer of a cigar , but sat with his hands flat on his knees . " As a matter of strict record , I have been sitting in the public gallery all morning . " " Uh-huh . I was pretty sure I saw you there , " observed H.M. casually . The other went a little more white . " It 's not a new trick . Charlie Peace did it at the trial of young Habron for the murder of the man Peace really killed . Honestly , you 've got more guts than I thought you had . " " But you did n't  --  speak up ? " " I hate rows in court , " sniffed H.M. , inspecting his fingers . " It disturbs the nice soothin ' atmosphere , and the feelin ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gather you got my message last night . " Dr. Hume put his hat on the floor , and leaned the umbrella carefully against the side of the chair . " The point is that you have got me here , " he retorted , but without heat . " Now will you answer one question ? How did you know where to find me ? " " I did n't , " said H.M. " But I had to try the most likely places . You 'd done a bunk . But you had time to write a very long , very careful , and very weighty letter to your niece ; and people who got to depend on the rush of airplanes or boat-trains do n't usually have time for that . You knew they 'd be after you , and that contempt of court is a criminal offense . There 's only one excuse for it  --  extreme illness . I thought you 'd probably run straight to your friend Tregannon , and gone to earth among the bedclothes and the ice-caps in his nursin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showin ' how ruddy unwell you were yesterday . I 've said a good many times that this tracing business is only a glorified version of the old chestnut about the  | idiot boy findin ' the lost horse : ' I just thought where I 'd have gone if I had been a horse ; and I went there ; and he had . ' I sent you a message there , and you had . " " Rather a queer kind of message , " said Spencer , looking hard at him . " Yes . That 's why it 's time we got down to business . I thought there was one person at least you would n't want to see hanged . " " You mean myself ? " " Right , " agreed H.M. , taking his hand away from shading his eyes . He got out his watch , a large cheap one of the turnip variety , and put it on the table . " Listen to me , doctor . I 'm not bluffin ' . I 'll prove it , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm due to be in court . I 'll wind up the defense of Jim Answell this afternoon . I do n't say this as a certainty , mind  --  but , when I do , I think the betting 's about a hundred to six that you 'll be arrested for murder . " The other remained quiet for a time , tapping his fingers on his knees . Then , reaching into an inside pocket , he took out a cigarette-case , extracted a cigarette , and closed the case with a rather vicious snap  --  as he might have closed a different sort of case . When he spoke , his voice was calm . " That is bluff . I wondered , and now I know . " " It 's bluff that I know where the ink-pad and the golfsuit and all the rest of it really disappeared to ; and that I 've got ' em all in my possession right now ? " With the same impassive expression , H.M. reached into his own side-pocket . He drew out a black ink-pad in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's name ; and he flung them on the table among the plates . For the hundredth time I wondered at the connection , especially at the contrast between the violence  | of H.M. 's hand and the inscrutability of his face . Dr. Flume did not seem so much taken aback as distressed and puzzled . " But my dear sir . . . yes , of course ; but what of it ? " " What of it ? " " Dr. Quigley , " answered the other , with quiet bitterness , " disposed of my character in court today . I suppose we shall have to accept his verdict . Granted that you produced every one of those interesting exhibits , what would it prove beyond what has already been proved ? The man who has been already drowned views the prospect of a sea-voyage with equanimity . " A rather ghastly smile , an edge of the old bouncing and bustling smile , touched his face . " I am not sure whether that is a quotation from Kai Lung . But , since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give a damn for your French monkey-tricks . " He lit the cigarette with a sharp jerk of the match across its box . H.M. remained staring at him for a short time , and H.M. 's face altered . " Y'know ? " H.M. began slowly . " Burn me , I 'm beginning to believe you really think Answell is guilty . " " I am quite certain he is guilty . " " Last night you wrote to Mary flume swearin' ' you saw the murder done . Do you mind tellin ' me if that was true ? " The other blew an edge of ash off his cigarette , holding it upright . " I strongly object to giving an opinion even on the weather , as a rule . This much I 'll tell you . The thing that has so  --  so fuddled and  --  yes , and maddened me throughout this whole affair , " he made a fierce gesture , " is that I have done absolutely nothing ! I tried to help Avory . I tried to help Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for everyone 's good . . . and what happened ? I am being hounded : yes , sir , I will repeat it : hounded . But even yes-  | terday , when I was forced to go away , I tried to help Mary . I admitted to her that I supplied the brudine , at Avory 's request . At the same time I was obliged to point out that James Answell is a murderer ; and , if it were with my last breath , I should call him a murderer . " Despite the man 's innate love of cliches , his apparent sincerity was such that it overcame even the self-pity in his voice . " You saw him do it ? " " I had to safeguard myself . If I wrote only the first part of the letter , you would take it into court , and it might help to save Answell  --  a murderer . So I had to ensure that you did not take it into court . " " Oh , " said H.M. in a different tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so that we would n't dare use it as evidence . " Dr. Hume waved this aside , and became more calm . " At considerable risk to myself , Sir Henry , I came here . That was in order to get as much information as I received . Fair play , eh ? Surely that is fair ? What I wish to know is my legal position in this matter . In the first place , I hold a certificate testifying to my illness yesterday ? " " From a doctor who 's goin ' to be struck off the register . " " But who is not yet so discredited , " replied the other . " If you insist on applying technicalities , I must use them as well . I was actually in attendance this morning , you know . In the second place , the Crown have waived their intention to call me as a witness ; and their case is closed . " " Sure . Still , the defense has n't closed the case . And you can still be called as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Spencer Hume put clown his cigarette carefully on the edge of the table . He folded his hands . " Sir Henry , you will not call me as a witness . If you do , I will blow your whole case sky-high in just five seconds . " " Oh-ho ? So we 're doin ' a little arguing about compounding a felony , now , are we ? " Hume 's face tightened , and he looked round quickly at us ; but H.M. had only a gleam of benevolent wickedness in his dull eye . " Never mind , " H.M. went on . " I 'm pretty unorthodox , not to say twisty . Have you got the incredible , stratospheric cheek to threaten you 'll go into the box and tell your story about seein ' the murder done , if I dare to pull you out of retirement ? Wow ! Honest , son , I really admire you . " " No , " said Hume calmly . " I need only tell a plain truth . " " Comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " said the other , and raised one finger with a critical air . " It was established this morning , you know , that this is not a court of morals . Because Mary went the way of all flesh , it is no reason why her testimony about a murder should be discredited . Because I intended bloodlessly and painlessly to put a blackmailer where he belonged ( a much less heinous offense to British ears , I assure you ) , that is no reason why my testimony about a murder should be discredited . " " Uh-huh . If you hate blackmailers so much , why try a spot of blackmail on me now ? " Dr. Hume drew a deep breath . " I honestly and sincerely am not . I merely tell you  --  do n't call me as a witness . Your whole case has been based on a missing piece of feather . You have repeatedly and even monotonously thundered at every witness , Where is that piece of feather ? ' " " Well ? "  | " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here it is . " Again he took out his cigarette-case . From under a line of cigarettes he carefully pulled out a piece of blue feather , some inch and a quarter long by an inch broad . He put it on the table with equal care . " You 'll notice , " he continued , during the heavy silence while H.M. 's face remained as impassive as ever , " that the edges are a bit more ragged than those on the other piece . But I think they 'll fit fairly well . Where was this piece of the feather ? God love you , I had it , of course ! I picked it up off the floor of the study on the night of the murder . It was no instinct for clews ; it was simply an instinct of tidiness . And why did n't I show it to anyone ? I can see you getting ready to ask that . My good fellow , do you know the only person who has ever been at all interested in this feather ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police never thought greatly about it  --  like myself . To be quite honest , I forgot all about it . But , if that feather is submitted in evidence , you will readily see the result . Have I convinced you ? " " Yes , " said H.M. , with a broad and terrifying grin . " At last you have . You 've convinced me you really did know about the Judas window after all . " Spencer Hume rose rather quickly to his feet , and his hand knocked to the floor the cigarette on the edge of the table . With an instinct of tidiness he had automatically put his foot on it when there was another knock on the door . This time the door opened more precipitately . Randolph Fleming , ducking under the low lintel , brought his aggressive red mustache into the room  --  and stopped in mid-sentence . " I say , Merrivale , they tell me that you  --  hullo ! " As though disconcerted at being put off his stride , Fleming stood staring at the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dandy as Spencer Hume : he wore a soft gray hat whose angle just escaped being rakish , and carried a silverheaded stick . His withered jowls swelled out as he regarded Spencer ; he hesitated , with an embarrassed air , and ended by making sure that the door was closed behind him . " Here , hang it ! " he said gruffly . " I thought you had ? " " Cut and run for it ? " supplied H.M. Fleming compromised with a blurred statement to Spencer Hume over his shoulder , " Look here , wo n't you get into a lot of trouble if you turn up now ? " Then he faced H.M. in an evident mood to get something off his mind . " First , like to say this . I 'd like to say no offense ; I do n't hold it against you for pitching into me yesterday in court . That 's your business , and all in the day 's work . Lawyers and liars , eh ? Always has been . Ha ha ha . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  for some reason I do n't understand  --  I may be called as a witness for your side as well . What 's up ? " " No , " said H.M. " I think there 'll be a clear enough identification from Shanks . Even if you do get asked anything , it 'll only be a matter of form . I got a crossbow I want to get identified as belongin ' to Avory Hume . Shanks should be able to do that pretty well . " " The odd-jobs man ? " muttered Fleming , and brushed up his mustache with the back of his gloved hand . " Look here , would you mind telling me ? " " Not at all , " said H.M. , as the other hesitated . " Not to put too fine a point on it , " said Fleming , " do you still think poor Hume was killed with a crossbow ? " " I always did think so . "  |  | Fleming considered this carefully . " I do n't admit anything to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glowering look . " But I thought I was bound to tell you one thing . I tried some experiments last night , just by way of making sure . And it could be done . It could be done , provided the distance was short enough . I do n't say it was , but it could be . Another thing ? " " Get it off your chest , son , " suggested II.M . He glanced over at the doctor , who was sitting very quietly , and making noises as though he were trying to clear a dry throat without having the sounds become too audible . " I tried it out three times  --  shooting arrows from a crossbow , I mean , " insisted Fleming , with an illustrative gesture . " The guide-feather does tend to get stuck in the teeth of the windlass , unless you 're damned careful . Once it stuck and pulled the whole feather off the shaft of the arrow when the bow was released . Another time it cut the feather in half  --  kkk ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . Mind you , " he wagged his finger , " not , as I say , that I 'd take back one word I said . But things like that worry me . I 'm damned if they do n't . I ca n't help it . I thought to myself , If there 's anything fishy in this , I ought to tell ' em about it . Only decent . If you think I like coming here and telling you , you 're off your chump ; but I 'm going to warn the Attorney-General about it too . Then it 's off my mind . But still , between ourselves , what did happen to that infernal piece of feather ? " For a short time H.M. looked at him without speaking . On the table , almost hidden by the dishes , lay the piece of blue feather Spencer Hume had put there . Spencer made a quick movement as Fleming spoke , but H.M. forestalled him . Scooping up the feather , H.M. put it on the back of  | his hand and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " It 's a very rummy thing about that , " remarked H.M. , without looking at Spencer . " We were just discussin ' the point as you came in . Do you think , for instance , that this could be the missin ' piece ? " " Where 'd you find it ? " " Well . . . now . That 's one of the points under debate . But , as an expert on the subject , would you just look at this little joker and decide whether it could be the one we want ? " Fleming took it gingerly and rather suspiciously . After a suspicious look between H.M. and Spencer , he carried the feather to the window and examined it in a better light . Several times his sharp little eye moved round during his examination . " Rubbish , " he said abruptly . " What 's rubbish , son ? " " This is . I mean , any idea that this is the other part of the feather . " Spencer Hume drew a folded handkerchief out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of gesture , he began to rub it round his face as though he were polishing that face to a brighter shine than it already had . Something in the expression of his eyes , something that conveyed doubt or misery , was familiar . I had seen just that expression somewhere before , and recently . It was too vivid for me to forget the slide of eyes or hands ; but why was it so fa-miliar ? " So ? " asked H.M. softly . " You 'd say pretty definitely it could n't be , eh ? Why not ? " " This is a turkey-feather . I told you  --  or rather you got  | it out of me  --  that poor old Hume did n't use anything except goose-feathers . " " Is there much difference ? " " Is there much difference . Ho ! " said Fleming , giving a fillip to the brim of his hat . " If you go into a restaurant and order turkey , and they serve you goose instead , you 're going to know the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A new thought appeared to strike him . " What 's going on here , anyhow ? " " That 's all right , " grunted H.M. , and continued without inflection : " We were just havin ' a bit of a private conference . We ? " Fleming drew himself up . " I had no intention of staying , " he said with dignity . " I came here to get something off my mind . Now I 've done it , my conscience is clear again and I do n't deny I shall take some pleasure in saying goodday . I 'll only say that there seems to be something infernally queer going on hereabouts . By the way , doctor . If I do manage to see the Attorney-General , shall I tell him you 're back and ready to testify ? " " Tell him anything you like , " Spencer answered quietly . Fleming hesitated , opening his mouth as though he were bedeviled to the edge of an outburst ; then he nodded with ponderous gravity , and made for the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own presence which had disturbed the room in a manner we could not analyze . H.M. got up and stood looking down at Spencer Hume . " Are n't you rather glad you did n't go into court ? " he asked quite mildly . " Set your mind at rest . I 'm not goin ' to call you as a witness . In your present frame of mind , I would n't dare . But right here , strictly among ourselves , you faked that evidence , did n't you ? "  | The other studied this . " I suppose you could call it that , in a way . " " But why the blazes did you fake it ? " " Because Answell is guilty , " said the other . And then I knew what the expression of his eyes reminded me of : it reminded me of James Answell himself , and of the same trapped sincerity with which Answell had faced accusations . It made even H.M. blink . H.M. gravely made a gesture which I could not interpret ; he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Judas window means nothin ' to you ? " he insisted , with another incomprehensible gesture at which Spencer peered doubtfully . " I swear it does not . " " Then listen to me , " said H.M. " You 've got two courses open to you . You can clear out . Or you can go to court this afternoon . If Walt Storm 's waived you as a witness , and if you 've really got a medical certificate for yesterday , you ca n't be arrested unless Balmy Bodkin cuts up awful rough ? which I do n't think he will . If I were you , I 'd go to court . You may hear something that will interest you , and will make you want to speak out . But you ought to know where the real piece of feather , the genuine one , is now . There are two parts of that missin ' piece . Half of the missin ' piece is stuck in the teeth of a crossbow that I 'm goin ' to produce in court . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the tide startin ' to swing against me , I warn you I 'll put you into the box no matter how dangerous you are . But I do n't think that 'll be necessary . That 's all I 've got to say , because I 'm goin ' back now . " We followed him out , leaving Spencer sitting by the table with the dying firelight red on his face , pondering . It was  | at this time yesterday that we had first heard of the Judas window . Before an hour had passed it was to be shown in all its hidden obviousness : it was to loom as large and practical as a sideboard , though of slightly different dimensions : and it was to swallow up Courtroom Number One . For the moment we knew only that the room was locked . On the landing Evelyn seized H.M. 's arm . " There 's one thing at least , " she said through her teeth , " you can tell . One little question that 's so easy it never occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well ? " inquired H.M. " What is the shape of the Judas window ? " " Square , " said H.M. promptly . " Mind that step . "  | XVI " I Put on This Dye Myself " " ? SHALL be the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " " Ar , " said the witness . The witness did not chew gum ; but the continual restless movement of his jaws , the occasional sharp clicking sound he made with his tongue to emphasize a point , gave the impression that he was occupied with an exhaustless wad of it . He had a narrow , suspicious face , which alternately expressed good nature and defiance ; a very thin neck ; and hair which seemed to be the color and consistency of licorice . When he wished to be particularly emphatic , he would jerk his head sideways in speaking , as though he were doing a trick with the invisible chewing-gum ; and turn his eye sternly on the questioner . Also , his tendency to address everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veiled awe  --  or it may have been a sign of the budding Communist tendencies indicated by the curl of his lip and the hammer-and-sickle design in his militant tie . H.M. plunged in . " Your full name 's Horace Carlyle Grabell , and you live at 82 Benjamin Street , Putney ? " " That 's right , " agreed the witness with cheerful defensive-  | ness , as though he were daring anyone to doubt this . " Did you use to work in the block of service-flats in Duke Street , D'Orsay Chambers , where the accused lives ? " " That 's right . " " What was your job there ? " " I was an Extra Cleaner-Up . " " What 's an Extra Cleaner-Up , exactly ? " " It 's like this . It 's the mess they makes , that the chambermaids do n't like . When their ashtrays gets full , they empties ' em into the waste-paper baskets . They sticks their old razor-blades anywhere they can , to get ' m out of sight . They leaves things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extra Cleaner-Up , especially when there was parties . " " Were you working there round about the third of January , last ? " " On that date , " corrected Horace Carlyle Grabell , with a pounce . " On that date , I was . " " Yes . Did you know the deceased , Mr. Hume ? " " I had n't the honor of his personal acquaintance ? " " Just confine yourself to answering the question , " said the judge sharply . " Very good , your Lordship , " said the witness smoothly , and his jaw extended at the same time his upper lip drew away from his teeth . " I was about to say : except once when we got very matey , and he gave me ten pounds to keep my mouth shut about his being a thief . " Several times before , a recorder would have had the opportunity of writing the word " sensation . " This one , which could hardly be called a full-fledged sensation since nobody knew what it meant , was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grabell spoke . The judge slowly  | took off his spectacles , disengaging them from under his tie-wig , folded them up , and contemplated him . " You quite understand what you are saying ? " inquired Mr. Justice Bodkin . " Oh , very good , your Lordship . " " I wished to make sure of that . Proceed , Sir Henry . " " We 'll try to make certain of it , my lord , " growled H.M. " Now , then . How 'd you come to know the deceased so well by sight ? " " I used to work at another place  --  not far away . Every week , Saturday mornings , they used to take the week 's takings up to the Capital Counties Bank in a leather bag . I went along ; kind of a bodyguard , you see ; not that it was ever needed . The deceased , he did n't actually do nothing ; I mean , he did n't take the money across the counter or nothing . He would just come out of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand with his hands behind his back , and nod to Mr. Perkins who brought the money , like as if he was giving his blessing to it . " " How many times d'ye think you saw him there ? " " Oh , umpteen . " " A dozen , do you think ? " " More'n that , " insisted the witness , shaking his head skeptically and drawing the air through a hollow tooth . " Every Saturday for six months or so . " " Now , where were you on the morning of Friday , January 3 , last ? " " Cleaning out the dustbin in 3C , " answered Grabell promptly . " That 's Mr. Answell 's flat . " He made a sign of quick and saturnine friendliness towards the prisoner , pushing his fist under his own chin as though to keep it up ; and  | instantly checked this with an air of portentous solemnity . " Where 's the dustbin ? " " In the kitchenette . " " This kitchenette opens into the dining-room ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door closed between ? " " Yes . Or very near . Just a crack . " " What 'd you see or hear then ? " " Well , I was n't making much noise . While I was standing in the kitchenette , I heard the door of the dining-room open ? that 's the other door to the dining-room , leading to the little entry . I thought , ' Ullo ! Because Mr. Answell was n't expected back . I peeped through and see a man come into the dining-room , walking very soft and quick . You could tell he was up to no good . The blinds was all drawn in the dining-room , too . First he gave a tap on all the walls , like as if he was looking for a safe . Then he started to open the drawers in the sideboard . What he took out I did n't know first going-off , because his back was to me . Then he went over and raised the blind to get a better look . I saw who he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " " Who was it ? " " This deceased , Mr. Hume . " " And what had he got in his hand ? " asked H.M. in a louder voice . " Captain Answell 's gun , that you 've got down on the table there . " " Hand it up to the witness . Take a closer look , and make sure it 's the one the deceased took out of that sideboard on Friday morning . " " That 's the one , " said the witness , reeling off the serial number of the pistol before it was put into his hand . He  | pulled out the clip and snapped it back again , turning round the automatic in a way that made the nearest woman juror shy back . " Why , I had to unload it meself once , when they was getting gay at a party . " " Tell us what happened after you saw Mr. Hume . " " Could n't believe my eyes , that 's what . He got out a little notebook and compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed away the gun in his pocket . Well , that was too much . I walked out quick and said , Hullo . ' I 'd got no call to be respectful to a chap who was there to steal . It gave him a turn , though he tried not to show it . He turned round with his hands behind his back and his eyebrows pulled down  --  trying to look like Napoleon , I daresay . He said , ' Do you know who I am ? ' I said , Yes ; and I also know you 've just pinched Captain Answell 's gun . ' He said not to be ridiculous ; he said it was a joke . I know that tone some of the nobs takes when they 've done the dirty and try to carry it off ; I know it ; and that 's why I knew he knew it . Why , there was that time Lord Borefastleigh got caught flat with the ace , king , and jack of trumps in his waistcoat pocket ? " " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , your Lordship . I said , Joke or not , you 're going down to the manager and explain why you 've just pinched Captain Answell 's gun . ' Then he got much quieter . He said , All right ; but do you know which side your bread is buttered on ? ' I said , I do n't know about that , guv'nor ; considering as I 've never seen any butter in me life . ' He said , in a way I 'll bet he did n't talk at the bank , There 's a quid in it for you if you keep your mouth shut about this . ' I thought I 'd just see what he was up to , and I said : ' I know what that is , guv'nor ; that 's margarine ; and I 've had  | plenty of that on me bread . ' He said , Very well ; ten pounds , and that 's my limit . ' So he went away with the gun . " " Did you take the ten pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lordship , I did , " answered Grabell , with defiant querulousness . " What would you have done ? " " It is not a matter on which I dare pass judgment , " said Mr. Justice Bodkin . " Go on , Sir Henry . " " He went away with the gun . " H.M. wagged his head . " And what did you do after that ? " " I knew he was up to no good , so I thought I 'd better warn Captain Answell about it . " " Oh ? Did you warn Captain Answell about it ? " " Yes . Not that he 's good for as much as a bob ; but I thought it was my duty to , that 's all . " " When did you warn him ? " " I could n't do it then , him being away in the country . But he turned up unexpected the next day ? " " Uh-huh . So , after all , he was in London on the Saturday of the murder , was he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's movement of the jaws , carried almost to the point of making a face , for a reply . " When did you see him ? " " ' Bout ten minutes past six on Saturday evening . He drove into the place behind the block of flats , where they park the cars . There was nobody else about , so I told him Mr. Hume had been there the day before and pinched his gun . " " What did he say ? " " He looked queer for a minute ; thoughtful-like ; then he said , Thanks ; that 'll be very useful , ' and up and handed me half-a-crown . Then he turned the car round and whizzed out of there . "  | " Now listen to me , son . The pistol that was found in the accused 's pocket  --  that gun  --  the gun he 's supposed to have taken with him on Saturday night to use on Mr. Hume ? was actually stolen out of the flat on Friday by Mr. Hume himself ? Is that right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples , " retorted the witness , leaning out of the box in response to H.M. 's pointed finger . H.M. sat down . Grabell might have been an insolent and garrulous witness , but these facts themselves made an enormous impression . We knew , however , that a tussle was coming . The antagonism which sprang up between this witness and Sir Walter Storm was apparent before the Attorney-General had uttered a word . Due to the Londoner 's instinctive awe and reverence before a red robe , which represents a hazy conception of Law-cum-Empire and things deeply rooted in them , Grabell had shown towards the judge a submissiveness approaching humility . Towards the prosecution he held no such views . They evidently represented to him someone who was merely out to do you down . Grabell must have gone into the box with one eye on them , and ready to bristle . This was not soothed by Sir Walter 's  --  entirely unintentional  --  lofty stare . " Ah . . . Grabell . You . tell us you accepted ten pounds from Mr. Hume ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an honorable act for you to accept it ? " " Do you think it was an honorable act for ' im to offer it ? " " Mr. Hume 's habits are not , I think , in question ? "  | " Well , then , they ought to be . You 're trying to hang that poor devil there because of ' em . " The Attorney-General suddenly must have looked so dangerous that the witness drew back a little . " Do you know what contempt of court is , Grabell ? " " Yes . " " In case you do not , my lord may have to make it quite clear to you . To avoid any unpleasant consequences , I must tell you that your business here is to answer my questions ? nothing else . Do I make myself , understood ? " Grabell , rather pale , looked as though he were straining at a leash ; but he jerked his head and made no comment . " Very well . I am glad you appreciate that . " Sir Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he pursued , with a sidelong glance at the jury , " that you are a follower of the doctrines of Karl Marx ? " " Never heard of him . " " Are you a Communist ? " " That 's as may be . " " Have you not made up your mind ? ? Did you , or did you not , accept a bribe from Mr. Flume ? " " Yes . But I went directly and told Captain Answell afterwards . " " I see . Your honor rooted in dishonor stands . ' Is that what you wish us to believe ? Do you wish us to believe that you are all the more trustworthy because you were twice unfaithful to a trust ? " " ' Ere , what 's all this ? " cried the witness , staring round . " You tell us that round about January 3 you were employed at D'Orsay Chambers , Duke Street . Are you not employed there now ? " " No . I left . "  | " You left : why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could call it that , yes . " " So you were dismissed . Why ? " " Answer the question , " said the judge sharply . " I did n't get on with the manager , and they were overstaffed . " " Did the manager give you a reference when you left ? " " No . " " But if you had left for the reasons you tell us , he must have given you a character , must n't he ? " Sir Walter Storm had not been prepared for this witness . But , with the knowledge of long experience , he knew exactly where to attack without having any actual information to draw on . " You tell us that on Friday morning , January 3 , you were cleaning out the dustbin ' in the prisoner 's flat ? " " Yes . " " How long had Mr. Answell and Captain Answell been away ? " " ' Bout a fortnight , maybe . " " About a fortnight . Why , then , was it necessary to clean out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They might have come back . " " Yet a moment ago you informed my learned friend that no one was expected back . Did you not ? " " It had to be done sometime . " " It had not been done by anyone during those entire two weeks ? " " No  --  that is ? "  | " I put it to you that the dustbin would have been cleaned when the occupants went away ? " " Yes , but I had to make sure . Look here , your Lordship .. . " " You further tell us , " pursued the Attorney-General , leaning both hands on the desk and settling his shoulders , " that , when you went in to do this , all the blinds were drawn and you made very little noise ? " " Yes . " " Are you accustomed to cleaning out the dustbin in dark-ness ? " " Look ' ere ! I never thought of it ? " " Or being careful to make no noise to disturb anyone in an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you actually were in the flat at the time you say  --  it was for a purpose other than cleaning out the dustbin ? " " It was not . " " Then you never went into the flat at all ? " " Yes , I did , if you 'd let me get in a word edgeways ; and what I 'm telling you is that old Hume was there , and he stole that gun , so help me ! " " Let us see if there is anything else that may help us . There is , I believe , a hall-porter at D'Orsay Chambers ? " " Yes . " " Will you accept my statement that this porter , when questioned by the police , testified he had not seen anyone resembling the deceased in D'Orsay Chambers on Friday or at any other time ? " " Maybe not . He came in by the back stairs ? " " Who came in by the back stairs ? " " Mr. Hume . Anyway , that 's how he went out , because I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this information to the police at the time ? " " No ; how could I ? I was n't there . I left my job the next day ? " " You left the next day ? " " I had been under notice for a month , yes , and that was Saturday . Besides , I did n't know it was important . " " Apparently not . There would appear to be a curious notion among several persons as to what may or may not have been important then , but is very important now , " said Sir Walter dryly . " When you say you saw Captain Answell in the car-park , was there any other person there who could substantiate the statement ? " " Nobody but Captain Answell himself . Why do n't you ask him ? " Mr. Justice Bodkin intervened . " The witness 's remark , though out of order , " he said with some asperity , " would seem pertinent . Is Captain Answell in court ? Considering that a part of the evidence depends on information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged up with a sort of ferocious affability . " My lord , Captain Answell is goin ' to appear as a witness for the defense . You need n't trouble to send for him . He 's been under subpoena for a long , long time ; and we 'll see that he is here , though I 'm not sure he 'll be a very willin ' witness for his own side . " ( " What on earth is all this ? " Evelyn asked in a whisper . " You heard the fellow say himself he was n't to be called as a witness . He must have known he 'd been subpoenaed ! What is happening ? " ) It was undoubtedly some trick on H.M. 's part : H.M.  | being determined to be the old maestro if it choked him . Beyond that nothing was known . " I have no more questions to ask this witness , " said Sir Walter Storm abruptly . " Call Joseph George Shanks , " said H.M. While Grabell was going out of the box , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on among the counsel for the Crown . The prosecution was in a strange and horned position . They must fight this through . That James Answell had been the victim of a mistake : that Flume had planned a trap for Reginald : even that Hume had stolen the pistol : was now being pushed towards a certainty . But these were details which did not , for everything that was said , in the least demonstrate the innocence of the prisoner . I remembered the words in the summing-up of a great jurist at another cause celebre : " Members of the jury , there is some circumstantial evidence which is as good and conclusive as the evidence of eye-witnesses . . . If I might give you an illustration : supposing you have a room with one door , and a closed window , and a passage leading from that door . A man comes up the passage , goes through the door into the room , and finds another man standing with a pistol , and on the floor a dead man : the circumstantial evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had just such a situation here . The prisoner had still been found in a locked room . The circumstantial evidence of that fact was still conclusive . No doubt had been cast on the central point , which was the only real point at issue . However damaged the case for the prosecution had become , Sir Walter Storm must finish this course . I was recalled by H.M. 's voice :  | " Your name 's Joseph George Shanks , and you were oddjobs man at number 12 Grosvenor Street ? " " Yessir , " said the witness . He was a little , broad man , so much like a dwarfed model of John Bull that his Sundaybest clothes sat oddly on him . Two polished knives of white collar stabbed his neck : they seemed to keep his voice light from the effort of keeping his neck high . " How long did you work there ? " " Ah , " said the other , considering . " Six years , more or less , I should think . " " What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hume 's archery things in order ; any repairs to ' em ; things like that . " " Take a look at this arrow , which was used to kill the deceased " ? the witness carefully wiped his hands on the seat of his Sunday trousers before accepting it ? " and tell the jury whether you 've seen it before . " " You-bet-I-have , sir . I fastened the feathers on . I remember this one . Dye 's a mite dark for the kind I meant . " " You often fastened the deceased 's special kind of feathers to the arrows ? And dyed the guide-feather ? Mr. Fleming told us that yesterday ? " " I did that , sir . " " Now , supposin ' I showed you a little piece of feather , " pursued H.M. with argumentative persuasiveness , " and I asked you to tell me definitely whether it was the piece of feather missing from the middle , there . . . could you do that ? " " If it was off this feather , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It would . But  --  just to take a different sort of question for a minute  --  you worked in that little workshop or shed in the back-garden , did n't you ? "  | " I 'm sure I did n't mean to press you , sir , " said the witness generously . " What was that ? Ah . Yes , I did . " " Did he keep any crossbows there ? " The stir of creaking that went through the room affected Shanks with a pleasant sense of importance . He relaxed , and leaned his elbows on the rail of the box . Evidently some stern eye was watching over his conduct from the spectators ' gallery over our heads ; for he seemed to become sensible of the impropriety of his posture , and straightened up hastily . " He did , sir . Three of them . Fine nasty-looking things . " " Where 'd he keep ' em ? " " In a big box , sir , like a big tool-box with a handle . Under the carpenter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at concentration . " Tell me : did you go down to that shed on the morning of Sunday , January 5 , the day after the murder ? " " Yes , sir . I know it was Sunday , but even so , consider-ing ? " " Did you notice anything different in the shed ? " " I did , sir . Somebody 'd been at that tool-box , or what I call a tool-box . It 's directly under the bench , you see , sir ; and there 's shavings and dust falls on it , like a coating , you see , sir ; and so if you look at it you can tell right away , without thinking anything of it , if someone has been at it . " " Did you look in the box ? " " Yes , sir , of course . And one of the crossbows was not there . " " What 'd you do when you found this out ? " " Well , sir , of course I spoke to Miss Mary about it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering ; and so I didn't. "  | " Could you identify that crossbow , if you saw it again ? " " I could , sir . " From his own hidden lair ( which he kept jealously guarded ) , H.M. made a gesture to Lollypop . There was produced a weapon very similar in appearance to the crossbow H.M. had used yesterday for the purposes of illustration . It was perhaps not quite so long , and had a broader head ; steel studs were set in a line down the stock , and there was a little silver plate let into it . " Is this the crossbow ? " said H.M. " That 's it ; yes , sir . Here 's even Mr. Hume 's name engraved on the little plate . " " Look at the drum of the windlass there , where you 'll see the teeth . Just tell me if there 's somethin ' caught in thereah , you got it ! Take it out . Hold it over so the jury can see . What is it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather . " Sir Walter Storm was on his feet . He was not amused now ; only grave , heavy , and polite . " My lord , are we to assume that this is being suggested as the mysterious piece of feather about which so many questions have been asked ? " " Only a part of it , melord , " grunted H.M. " If it 's examined , we 'll see that there 's still a little bit of it missin ' . Not much . Only a piece about a quarter by half an inch square . But enough . That , we 're suggestin ' , is the second piece . There are three of them . One 's yet to come . " After the amenities , he turned back to the witness . " Could you say definitely whether or not the piece you 've got in your hand came off that broken guide-feather on the arrow ? " " I think I could , sir , " said the witness , and blinked . " Just look at it , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and hunched his shoulders over it , there was a sound of shuffling or sliding in court . People were trying surreptitiously to rise and get a look . The prisoner , his face sharper now and less muddled , was also staring at it ; but he seemed as puzzled as anyone else . " Ah , this is right , sir , " declared Shanks . " It comes off here . " " You 're sure of that , now ? I mean , one part of a broken feather might be deceptive , might n't it ? Even if it 's a goosefeather , and even if it 's got a special kind of dye on it , can you still identify it as comin ' from that particular arrow ? " " This one I can ; yes , indeed , yes . I put on this dye myself . I put it on with a brush , like paint . That 's what I meant by saying it fitted . There 's a slip in the paint here that makes a lighter mark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper part of the question-mark , but the little dot and part of the tail I do n't see .... " " Would you swear , " said H.M. very gently , " would you swear that the part of feather you see stickin ' in that crossbow came from the feather on the arrow in front of you ? " " I would indeed , sir . " " For the moment , " said H.M. , " that 's all . " The Attorney-General got up with a suavity in which there was some impatience . His eye evidently made Shanks nervous . " The arrow you have there bears the date 1934 , I think . Does that mean you prepared the arrow , or dyed it , in 1934 ? " " Yes , sir . About the spring , it would be . " " Have you ever seen it since , close enough to examine it ? What I mean is this : After winning the annual wardmote  | in 1934 , Mr. Hume hung that arrow on the wall of his study ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since , have you ever been close enough to examine it since ? " " No , sir , not until that gentleman , " he nodded towards H.M. , " asked me to look at it a month ago . " " Oh ! But from 1934 until then you had not actually looked at the arrow ? " " That 's so , sir . " " During that time you must , I presume , have handled and prepared a good many arrows for Mr. Hume ? " " Yes , sir . " " Hundreds , should you say ? " " Well , sir , I should n't quite like to go so far as that . " " Just try to give an approximate number . Would it be fair to say that you had handled or prepared over a hundred arrows ? " " Yes , sir , it might be that . They use an awful lot . " " I see . They use an awful lot . Do you tell us , then , that out of over a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallibly identify one arrow on which you put dye in 1934 ? I remind you that you are upon oath . " At this tremendous reminder , the witness cast an eye up at the public gallery as though for support . " Well , sir , you see , it 's my job ? " " Please answer the question . Out of over a hundred arrows , over a space of years , can you infallibly identify one on which you put dye in 1934 ? " " I should n't like to say , sir , may I go to he  --  may I be ? that is , to say everything should happen to me ? "  | " Very well , " said the Attorney-General , who had got his effect . " Now ? " " But I 'm sure of it just the same , mind ! " " Though you can not swear to it . I see . Now , " continued the other , picking up some flimsy typewritten sheets , " I have here a copy of the prisoner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the witness . ) Will you take that statement , Mr. Shanks , and read out the first paragraph for us ? " Shanks , startled , took the paper with an automatic gesture . First he blinked at it in the same doubtful way he had shown before . Then he began to fumble in his pockets , without apparent result while the delay he was giving the court evidently preyed worse and worse on his mind , until such a gigantic pause upset him completely . " I ca n't seem to find-my specs , sir . I 'm afraid that without my specs ? " " Do I understand , " said the other , who had rightly interpreted that blinking of the eyes , " that without your spectacles you can not read the statement ? " " It 's not exactly to say I ca n't , sir ; but ? " " Yet you can identify an arrow on which you put dye in 1934 ? " asked Sir Walter Storm  --  and sat down . This time H.M. did roar up for re-examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How many times did Avory Hume win the annual corn petitions ? " " Three times , sir . " " The arrow was a special prize on those occasions , was n't it ? " " Yes , sir . " " So it was n't just one out of over a hundred , ' was it ? It was a special thing , a keepsake ? "  | " Yes , sir . " " Did he show you the arrow , and call your attention to it , after he 'd won the first-shot competition ? " " Yes , sir . " " Ha , " said H.M. , lifting his robe in order to hitch up his trousers . " That will do . No , not that way out , son ; that 's the judge 's bench ; the warder 'll show you . " He waited until Shanks had been taken away , and then he got up again . " Call Reginald Answell , " said H.M.  | XVII " At the Opening of the Window ? " REGINALD ANSWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of him , and led him to the box , he seemed a free man . But just behind him I saw a familiar figure whose name eluded me until I remembered Sergeant-Major Carstairs , who guards the entrance to H.M. 's lair at Whitehall . On the sergeant-major 's face was the sinister look of a benevolent captor . Again you could hear the rustle of the wind in trees of scandal ; every eye immediately tried to find Mary Hume as well , but she was not in court . Reginald 's long and bony face was a little pale , but very determined . I remember thinking then that he looked a tricky customer , and had better be handled as such  --  whatever H.M. had in mind . But this may have been due to a surge of dislike caused by the slight ( manufactured ) wave in his dark-yellow hair , or the cool glaze of self-possession on his features : the latter more than the former . He took the oath in a clear , pleasant voice . H.M. seemed to draw a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wiles that lay beneath the surface , whether H.M. would find himself cross-examining his own witness .  | " Your name is Reginald Wentworth Answell ; you have no residence , but when you 're in London you live at D'Orsay Chambers , Duke Street ? " " Yes . " " I want you to understand , " said H.M. , folding his arms , " that you 're not obliged to answer any question which will incriminate you  --  about any activities . " He paused . " This question , however , wo n't incriminate you . When the police talked to you about your general movements on the evenin ' of January 4 , did you tell ' em the whole truth ? " " The whole truth , no . " " Are you ready to tell the truth now , under oath ? " " I am , " said Reginald with great apparent sincerity . His eyes flickered ; there is no other way to describe it . " Were you in London early in the evenin ' on January 4th ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrived at D'Orsay Chambers a few minutes past six o'clock . " It was possible that H.M. stiffened a little , and an odd air of tensity began to grow again . H.M. tilted his head on one side . " So-o ? I understood it was ten minutes past six o'clock . Was n't it ? " " I am sorry . It was a little earlier than that . I distinctly remember the clock in the dashboard of my car . " " Had you intended to see the deceased that night ? " " Yes . Socially . " " When you got to D'Orsay Chambers , did you see the witness Horace Graben ? " " I did . " " Did he tell you about the deceased 's visit to your flat on Friday ? "  | " He did . " " Did he tell you the deceased had taken your pistol , and gone away with it ? " " He did . " " And what did you do then ? " " I could not understand it , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see Mr. Hume after all . I went away . I  --  drove round a bit , and  --  and before long I left town . I  --  did not return until later . " H.M. sat down rather quickly . There had been a curious intonation in that " before long " ; H.M. had seemed to catch it , for we all did . And Sir Walter Storm was very quick to rise . " You tell us , Captain Answell , " began the Attorney-General , " that you drove round a bit , ' and before long ' you left town . How long ? " " Half an hour or a little more , perhaps . " " Half an hour ? As long as that ? " " Yes . I wanted to think . " " Where did you drive ? " Silence . " Where did you drive , Captain Answell ? I must repeat my question . " " I drove to Mr. Hume 's house in Grosvenor Street , " answered the witness . For a second the implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney-General , whatever his thoughts might have been , hesitated before he went on . The witness 's air of pale candor was that of the " engaging " Reginald Answell I had seen yesterday . " You drove to Mr. Flume 's house , you say ? " " Yes . I hoped you would not ask that . " He looked briefly  | towards the prisoner , who was staring at him . " I told them I could do him no good . I understood I was not to be called as a witness . " " You understand that it is your business to tell the truth ? Very well . Why did you go to Mr. Hume 's house ? " " I do n't know , exactly . I thought it was a queer show , a very queer show . I did not intend to go in ; I only intended to cruise past , wondering what was  --  was up . " " At what time did you arrive at the house ? " demanded the Attorney-General . Even Sir Walter Storm could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was up . " At ten minutes past six . " The judge looked up quickly . " One moment , Sir Walter . " He turned his little eyes on the witness . " If you arrived there at ten minutes past six , that must have been at the same time as the prisoner ? " " Yes , my lord . As a matter of fact , I saw him go in . " There are , I suppose , no degrees of a man 's being motionless . Yet I had never seen H.M. convey such a mere impression of absolute stillness as he did then . He was sitting with a pencil in his hand , enormous under his black gown ; and he did not even seem to breathe . In the dock , James Answell 's chair suddenly scraped . The prisoner made a curious , wild gesture , like a boy beginning to put up his hand in a classroom , and then he checked himself . " What did you do then ? " asked the Attorney-General . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , and why Jim was there . He had not spoken about coming here when I saw him last at Frawnend . I wondered if it concerned me , as having been a suitor of Miss Hume 's . For what I did , " said the witness , drawing himself up , " I do not apologize . Any human being would have done the  | same . I knew that there was an open passage leading down between Mr. Hume 's house and the house next door ? " Sir Walter Storm ( be it recorded ) seemed forced to clear his throat . He was not now like a man either cross-examining or examining , but one trying to get at the truth . " Had you ever been to the house before , Captain Ans-well ? " " Yes , several times , although I had never met Mr. Hume . I had been there with Miss Hume . Mr. Hume did not approve of our acquaintanceship . " " Go on , please . " " You hear what counsel tells you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your story . " " I had heard a great deal of Mr. Hume 's study ' from Miss Hume . I knew that if he entertained Jim anywhere , it would be there . I walked down the passage beside the house  --  with no motive in mind , I swear , except to get near them . Some way down the passage , on the right-hand side , I found a short flight of steps leading up to a glass-paneled door with a lace curtain over it . The door looks into the little passage outside Mr. Hume 's study . As I looked through the curtain , I saw the butler  --  who was taking Jim there  --  knock on the study door . " The change in the air was as though a draft had begun to blow and scatter papers on counsel 's table . " What did you do then ? " " I  --  waited . " " Waited ? " " Outside the door . I did not know quite what to do . " " How long did you wait ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until a little later than half-past six , when they broke in . " " And you , " demanded Sir Walter , pointing , " you , like others , have made no mention of this to anyone until this moment ? " " No . Do you think I wanted them to hang my cousin ? " " That is not a proper reply , " snapped the judge . " I beg your Lordship 's pardon . I  --  put it that I was afraid of the interpretation which would be placed on it . " Sir Walter lowered his head a moment . " What did you see while you were outside the glass-paneled door ? " " I saw Dyer come out about fifteen minutes past six . I saw Miss Jordan come down about half-past six , and knock at the door . I saw Dyer return then , and heard her call out to Dyer that they were fighting . And the rest of ? " " One moment . Between six-fifteen , when Dyer left the study , and six-thirty , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study door ? " " I did not . " " You had a good view of it ? " " Yes , the little passage has no light ; but there was a light in the main hall . " " From where you were standing outside that door  --  hand the witness up a plan  --  could you see the windows of the room ? " " Yes . They were immediately to my left , as you can see . " " Did anyone approach those windows at any time ? " " No . " " Could anyone have approached those windows without your knowledge ? " " No . I am sorry . I suppose I incur penalties for not telling this ? "  | I make a pause here , for there was a similar kind of blankness in the room . We have heard much of last-minute witnesses for the defense . This one , though called for the defense , was a last-minute witness for the prosecution who put the rope firmly round the prisoner 's neck . James Answell 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the trial ; and he was staring at his cousin in a vague and puzzled way . But there was another kind of pause or change as well ? that is , if it did not exist only in my own prejudiced mind . Up to this time , sallow-faced and stiff-lipped Reginald had seemed ( in a quiet way ) inspired . He compelled belief . He brought to this case what it had heretofore lacked : an eyewitness to support circumstantial evidence . It may have been a certain turn in his last sentence , " I suppose I shall incur penalties for not telling this ? " which gave a slightly different glimpse . It did not last long . But it was as though a cog had failed to mesh , or a shutter had been drawn aside , or the same glutinous quality of hypocrisy had appeared in his speech which had appeared once before . The man was lying : I felt convinced of that . More , you could see he had gone into the box with the deliberate intention of lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw Sir Walter Storm 's attack But surely H.M. knew that ? H.M. must have been prepared for it ? At the moment H.M. was sitting in the same quiet way , his fists at his temples . And the point was its effect not on H.M. , but on the jury . " I have no more questions , " said Sir Walter Storm . He seemed puzzled . H.M. roused himself to a re-examination which was really a cross-examination of his own witness . And when H.M.  | did get up , he used words that are not common at the Old Bailey , and have not been since the days of Sergeant Arabin . But there was not only violence in it ; there was a sort of towering satisfaction which made him seem about a foot taller . " I 'll give you just two seconds , " said H.M. , " to admit that you had an attack of delirium tremens , and that everything you said in that examination was a lie . " " You will retract that , Sir Henry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness on any matters that have risen out of Sir Walter 's cross-examination ; but you will express yourself in a proper manner . " " If yrludship pleases , " said H.M. " It 'll be understood why I 'm takin ' this line when I do question . . . . Captain Answell , do you want to retract any statement you 've made ? " " No . Why should I ? " " All right , " said H.M. with massive unconcern . " You saw all this through the glass panel of the door , did you ? " " Yes . " " Was the door open ? " " No . I did n't go inside . " " I see . Aside from the night of January 4 , when was the last time you visited that house ? " " Nearly a year ago , it may have been . " " Uh-huh . I thought so . But did n't you hear Dyer testify yesterday that the door with the glass panel , ' the old door , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid wooden door ? If you got any doubts on the matter , look up the official surveyor 's report  --  it 's one of the exhibits here  --  and see what he has to say about it . What do you have to say about it ?
