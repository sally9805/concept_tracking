ARMY &; NAVY <P> Only organization allowed to fly its flag over the U. S. Capitol is the American War Mothers . Only time War Mothers are allowed to exercise their privilege is Nov. 11 . Last week War Mothers ' President Mrs. Irving Fairweather watched the flag hoisted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars ' Chief Lobbyist Millard Rice . The hoisting was followed by a speech from Florida 's onetime ( 1933-37 ) Governor David Sholtz , a rendering of The Unknown Soldier , composed by the late Secretary of the Treasury William H. Woodin , by the U. S. Navy School of Music Band . Thus observed in the nation 's capital last week , the 19th Anniversary of the end of the World War was more or less similarly celebrated throughout the rest of the U. S. Meanwhile in Texas last week the largest motorized army maneuvers ever held in the Western Hemisphere were reaching their climax . <P> Consequence of the Texas maneuvers , which started two months ago , is likely to be a wholesale reorganization of the U. S. Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes by day in a cloud of dust , sometimes at night with an endless , ominous growl of motors , was something the like of which not only Texas but no one else in the U. S. had ever seen before . It was the " P. I. D. " - Proposed Infantry Division-which , under consideration for two years , was being tested for the first time under combat conditions . <P> During the War , an infantry division consisted of about 22,000 men , divided into two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each , one field artillery brigade usually of three regiments . It moved mainly on foot . Two years ago , U. S. Chief of Staff Malin Craig decided that engineering and mechanical progress had made the infantry division obsolete , asked his staff for a report on a new unit to embody all changes in power , transport and armament mechanization since the War . Result of his demand , the P. I. D. consists of 13,500 officers and men , contains three unbrigaded infantry regiments , one artillery regiment of four battalions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to march entirely on wheels . Slogging along on foot , an old style division does well to cover 18 miles a day . Last week the P. I. D. covered 326 . When reports of its maneuvers have been studied at Washington , the War Department may abolish the old style division entirely , streamline the whole army in similar units if and when it can get the money to cover the prodigious cost .
