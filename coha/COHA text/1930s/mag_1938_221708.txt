As Secretary Hull and Secretary Ickes were last week finding ways to make themselves disagreeable to aggressive Germany , aggressive Japan took one opportunity and was given another to make herself agreeable to the U. S. <P> Boats . Since 1935 Alaska 's $46,000,000-a-year salmon-fishing industry , which depends on salmon spawned in Alaskan rivers and caught as they return from the sea to the rivers to breed , has yelled bloody murder about Japanese fishermen operating offshore . When the Japanese Government subsidized a three-year " salmon survey " of the Bering Sea in 1935 , Alaska fishermen maintained that Japanese boats were trawling with heavy nets in all seasons , would soon exhaust the grounds . Japan retorted variously that she was investigating the possibility of floating canneries , that her nationals were not invading U. S. waters within the three-mile international limit , that licenses had been issued to Japanese boats only for crab fishing . <P> Last fall Alaska 's Congressional Delegate Anthony J. Dimond brought the controversy to a head by introducing a resolution boldly forbidding foreign vessels to fish anywhere on Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings on the bill to testify that Japanese boats had been observed within the three-mile limit hauling in salmon with four-mile nets , that aviators flying over the Japanese fleet had seen as many as 20,000 salmon piled on the decks of four fishing vessels , that at the present rate Alaska 's salmon would not last five years . The State Department , whose agreements with Great Britain and Japan settled the similar dispute over Bering Sea seal fishing in the ' 80s , sent a note to Japan affirming that salmon spawned in the U. S. and protected by the Bureau of Fisheries were U. S. property , waited for an answer . Last week it came in satisfactory form . In what amounted to a complete capitulation , Japan promised to suspend her " survey , " issue no licenses for salmon fishing in the area , " take measures " to halt any violators of the agreement . <P> Boat . Having already promised to make " indemnification for all the losses " sustained when Japanese bombing planes sank the U. S. gunboat Panay , proceeding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December 12 , Japan last week received an itemized bill from U. S. Ambassador Joseph C. Grew in Tokyo . Property losses were put at $1,945,670.01 , indemnification for death and personal injuries at $268,337.35 . On the total of $2,214,007.36 , which includes no punitive damages , the State Department expected prompt payment .
