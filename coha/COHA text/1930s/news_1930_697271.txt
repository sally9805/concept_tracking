txt The passage of the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill in the American Congress , although anticipated in French and other European business quarters , has given those influential interests which have been agitating the movement against the expanding American trade with Europe just the stimulus they need to push their plans to fruition . The immediate reaction to the Congressional approval is that nothing can now be expected to result from Europe 's protests to Washington and the best thing European industrialists can do is to come together and plan " defensive measures "  --  a term which , when translated into plain English means reprisals . There is a curious silence throughout the French press today , and not one in thirty or more daily newspapers published in Paris gives voice to the deep resentment they so often expressed during the seventeen months of discussion of the new duties . Most of the newspapers , however , inform their readers that there is little doubt President Hoover will sign the bill , and it may be the press is holding off until the measure receives Presidential sanction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonferrous metal interests had combined to " free " European countries from American domination in copper , lead and zinc prices and policies , and its interpretation by competent American experts as the first direct reply to the new tariff , was followed today by news that the much discussed European automobile cartel movement had again been revived . The adoption of the tariff bill , it is said here , has given new life to the suggestion , and further meetings will soon be held in Italy or Belgium with a view to reaching an accord to place American motor car sales in Europe on a quota basis . Should the participants find it impossible to act in union , a substitute arrangement will be proposed , under the temps of which each country will agree to take those measures of " protection " best suited to respective national problems . The lead for the latter method has already been taken by France , which recently established new high duties on American motor cars , trucks and parts . Similar action by other European countries would cause a loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been going on for the past two weeks between the chief trade organizations of a dozen European countries . Now it is ascertained a meeting of representatives of these groups probably will be called the end of the month or early in July . The official purpose may be described as a consultation regarding European trade conditions , but the real object will be the consideration of a well-formulated plan for " hitting back " at the new American protectionism . The basic principle would be the withdrawal of European orders from the United States wherever it was found the same commodities could be purchased under equally satisfactory terms in friendlier markets . . Proposed a Year Ago . This scheme was first proposed a year ago by four of the principal French trade organizations and was discussed informally at the Amsterdam congress of the International Chamber of Commerce last July , but the effective intervention of Thomas Lamont , head of the American delegation , caused the leaders to " postpone " consideration . French and other European business men nevertheless have nursed the idea ever since and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prove to be the necessary inspiration for an attempt to put it into effect . The only comment In the weekly press is from the pen of Francois Marsal , former Finance Minister and politician . eThe American protectionists , " he writes , " by the very exaggeration of their doctrine run the risk of causing profound economic disturbances at home and throughout the world . Let us hope President Hoover , who is thoroughly forewarned , will discover means to halt his country on such an unfortunate path . " In Europe reactions can be grave , the brutality of American expansion , accompanied too often by a policy of dumping , preoccupies the whole world . We have already said that if a European economic bloc was possible and desirable it must not be directed against another continent . But if the United States persists in her present policy , it is to be feared it will cause the unity of Europe at her own expense . "                    @
