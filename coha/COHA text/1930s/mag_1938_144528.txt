Now that France has got rid of her first and only Socialist Premier , hectic Lon ( " New Deal " ) Blum , the British last week were ready to give important financial aid to new Middle Class Premier Edouard Daladier . President Roosevelt was ready , too . <P> Mr. Roosevelt is the first U. S. President in modern times to speak really fluent French , and both his mother and his wife share his feelings for La Patrie . Last week , when London put to Washington the idea of permitting Paris to cheapen the franc , thus giving France a competitive advantage in world markets , while holding the dollar and pound at present levels , the hesitations of the President and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr . were brief . Nevertheless , these hesitations were agonizing to Premier Edouard Daladier , for , although most Frenchmen were convinced the franc must be again cheapened , some French fiscal experts believed Franklin Roosevelt would take this occasion to cheapen the dollar too , as he did four years ago . <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Secretary H. Merle Cochran of the U. S. Embassy , Paris , dictated two precious paragraphs . After these were handed on Embassy stationery to Premier Daladier. confirming that what he was going to do was no violation of the Tripartite Monetary Accord of the U. S. , France and Britain which was signed to keep their three currencies level with each other ( TIME , Oct. 5. 1936 ) , Premier Daladier was able to announce devaluation of the franc over the radio and to tell Frenchmen that the pound and dollar would not be devalued to compete with the cut-rate French money he was about to offer . <P> Alibi . Since it is unpleasant for any Great Power to have to offer its money at cut rates , the excuse of dire emergency is always offered in such cases , and Orator Daladier went on the air with this vibrant alibi : " The truth is that our economic life is in a very bad condition ; that legitimate profit is tending to disappear ; that partial unemployment is increasing in every branch of industry ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures are a humiliation for all Frenchmen ! ' ' <P> " Can Only Improve ! " After thus citing calamity and their justification , the French Cabinet cut the value of the franc about 9% last week . In terms of the Roosevelt dollar of today the French franc in 1914 was worth 33 , now is worth just under 3 . <P> This means that any French War widow who has kept her money stowed away in banknotes in the family sock since she lost her husband in Joffre 's heroic defense of the Marne has now been thoroughly , almost completely , swindled-and yet France has never resorted to " uncontrolled inflation " of the kind Germany went through after the War . <P> Honest , orthodox M. Daladier last week , took a handsome " profit " for the French Treasury at once . This profit , obtained by " revaluing " the gold stocks of the Bank of France and the exchange fund of the State , totaled 47 billion francs . <P> Anyone who sold francs fortnight ago , buying another currency or gold ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and then bought francs again last week made a similar " profit .
