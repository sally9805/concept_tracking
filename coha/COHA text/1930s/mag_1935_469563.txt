IT WAS after midnight , and the last j extras were being cried through the streets ; but the lobby of New Orleans ' largest hotel was still crowded and full of noise . In one of the many recesses of the colonnaded hall , its area of carpet littered with cigarette stubs and cigar bands and torn scraps of paper , a radio sent out the last of the parish returns . Surrounded all evening , an instrument of jubilation or despair , it was now forgotten . Feliciana 's final tabulation was lost in a tumult of cowbells and singing and blaring tin horns . What happened in Feliciana , or in St. James or Lafourche no longer mattered . The 1928 election for governor was over . Huey was in . Louisiana , for better or for worse , had taken unto herself a new head man . I was a reporter on a New Orleans newspaper then and had been sent to get a story about him , the successful candidate on the night of his victory . My paper had not supported him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Long had not yet taken to the habit of having reporters from opposition newspapers thrown from his rooms . That was to come later , when the struggle for power in Louisiana began to gain its present bitterness ; when Long , surrounding himself with bodyguards , set out to become monarch of all he could possibly survey . He was younger then , just thirty-five , and less experienced in dictatorial tactics . Besides , on this occasion he could afford to talk to his enemies ? even if only to crow . But though I came from the tents of the thoroughly licked , I was glad he had won . I had no liking or any admiration for either of his opponents . One of them , the incumbent Governor , was an opportunist politician whose term of office had been distinguished only by its apathy and several minor scandals . The other , the nominee of the New Orleans ring , was a veteran Democrat who had been embalmed in the House of Representatives for fourteen years . And I was sick , having grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , of the stupidity and rottenness and the cheap crookedness of the New Orleans gang . We had our own Boss Tweed , a swan and clever barroom statesman named Martin Behrman , and the Tammany he built up had collected tribute from the city for over thirty years . I had heard Long speak to the country people many times . I remember one meeting in a little town in the Teche country . It was late fall , but the long bayou summer had lingered and the evening was hot and still . There were patches of perspiration on the blue shirts of the fishermen and the women stirred the air with slow palmetto fans . Huey , his shirt plastered to his back with sweat , was speaking from the rear seat of a Ford ; pouring , as they say in that part of the world , acid in their eyes . He attacked the utilities and corporations and the New Orleans ring . He promised us paved roads , free ferries and bridges , lower gas and electric rates , free schoolbooks ? and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft . It was possible to believe what he said , to think that he was earnest and sincere , because as Public Service Commissioner , an office to which he was elected at the age of twenty-five , he had actually opposed the forces he now was baiting ? winning , in several cases , important victories for the people . He was young too and spoke American instead of bombast , and I liked his similes and metaphors derived from the barnyard and the cornfield . I liked the stories he told and I joined the others in laughing . They understood and liked him . I liked him too . I had just become awakened politically , beginning to take an interest in such things , and I thought that here was a young and forceful radical it would be well to support . He was such a relief after the ignorant and dull-witted ring masters in New Orleans , outstanding among whom was our Mayor , a tea and coffee merchant now deceased who , in answer to a group of women who came to him asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Greek theater , said that there were not enough Greeks in New Orleans to support such a theater . So I was glad , as I made my way through the celebrants which crowded his campaign headquarters , that this wild young mustang from the hills of Winn Parish had been elected . At the particular moment I reached his desk , littered with folders and circulars that already had the appearance of belonging to the past , he happened to be talking to several of his lieutenants . His face , naturally florid , was flushed a purplish red . His shirt was open at the throat and his eyes , set deep in his fleshy face , were heavyand bloodshot . Tousled reddish curls tumbled upon his forehead . He held out his hands , clasping those of his comrades . " Thank you , Gus , " he said . " Thank you , Oscar . You fellers stick to me . We 're just getting started . This is only the beginning . We 'll show this New Orleans gang who is boss . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na , be President some day . " I have heard many such declarations since and have come to understand his driving mania for power ; but at that time I was less informed . I could not reconcile these words with those of the man I had heard in the bayou country . I felt , not without a smoldering of rebellion , that I had somehow been betrayed . II It is an axiom among newspapermen that a politician who does not get his name into the newspapers is a dead politician . Mr. Long , if only by the terms of this axiom , is very much alive . There is no man in public office , with the exception of President Roosevelt , about whom so much has been written and who is more widely known . During the past few years I have lived in various parts of the country , both in the North and in the South . Wherever I go when it is learned I am from Louisiana I am immediately asked about Huey Long . People want to know about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but he has impressed himself upon their imaginations . They seek an explanation for his being . Many such explanations have been attempted . He has been called a clown , a paranoiac , a superman . He is most generally described , however , as a product of the depression : a demagogue who has captured the attention of thousands of persons bewildered and desperate after five years of suffering and confusion . But this may be said , with equal truth , of Upton Sinclair and Father Coughlin . The explanation of Huey Long goes farther back into the past . He is a product , not of depression , but of the Civil War . His career rests , not so much on the crash of 1929 as upon Grant 's hammering in Virginia and Sherman 's march through Georgia . He is the rcsult ? I think the inevitable result ? of a political and economic tendency that has been developing in the South for over seventy , years . The pattern of society in the South before the Civil War is best thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which it rested its continuance and security , was the dark base of the slaves . At its apex , representing only a small minority of the population , were the aristocrats , the landed overlords who imparted to ante-bellum society those romantic and feudal characteristics which give the popular conception of the old plantation its ideal coloring . Between the masters and slaves , composing the bulk of the white citizenry , was the lower middle class ? the forgotten men and women of the Old South . This class , containing roughly all those persons who did not fall within the aristocratic category , was composed principally of small farmers who , because of the economic caste system , had been driven to those parts of the various Southern States where the land was too poor to be cultivated by the plantation owners . Out of touch with even provincial centers of civilization , isolated in the hollows and hills , they led lives of varying degrees of misery . They were ignorant and superstitious . They lived in mud-plastered shacks which sometimes served as both home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . Their women were broken at thirty and , to the horror of more than one traveler , their children often ate clay . They had little or no voice in the affairs of government . To hold office , because of the property requirements prevailing in many sections , was practically impossible . Tu enter the professions was equally difficult . They could not , because of the slaves , even hire themselves out as laborers . Their only outlets were sex , corn whiskey , and religion . Those a little higher in the social scale were not much better off . Poverty , illiteracy , and a curious resentment toward learning were widespread . Sidney Andrews , a Bostonian traveling through the South in the ' 60 's , wrote in his notebook : In the important town of Charlotte , North Carolina , I found a white man who owned the comfortable house in which he lived , who had a wife and three children , and yet had never taken a newspaper in his life . He thought they were handy for wrapping purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the reading of them . He knew some folks spent money for them , but he also knew " a.many " a house where none had ever been seen . I also met several persons ? whites , and not of the clay-eater class either ? who had never been inside a schoolhouse and who did n't mean to ' low their children to go inside one . . . . In the upper part of South Carolina I stopped one night at the house of a moderately well-to-do farmer who had never owned any book but a Testament , and that was given to him . When I expressed some surprise at this fact , he assured me that he was as well off as some other people thereabouts .. Between Augusta and Milledgeville , I rode in a stagecoach in which were two of the delegates of the Georgia Convention . When I said that I hoped the day would soon come in which schoolhouses would be as numerous in Georgia as in Massachusetts , one of them answered , " Well , I hope it 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion " ; whereupon the other responded , " That 's my opinion , too . " Mr. Andrews , obviously a person of no great tact , was a fairly accurate reporter . His testimony is substantiated poverty and suppression , began to gain first , forout , cautiously and timidly at rs in power and importance . It began for some of the advantages and privileges reserved for the aristocracy . A new mercantile class also came into being . Formerly on the all-sufficient plantations the commissary was the source of distribution for all the food , clothing , and supplies needed by the community . There were stores and markets in the city , but in the country , at some crossroads or in some dusty town , a general store provided for the wants of the neighborhood . After the war , however , thousands of persons went into shopkeeping ? that favorite occupation of the middle class . " I found Georgia full of runners from the North , " wrote one traveler in /866 . " They represented all branches of trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Everybody seems to have a passion for keep . ing store and hundreds of men are going into trade who should go into agriculture . " Faced with these fundamental changes , all resulting from the collapse of the social system they believed imperishable , the aristocrats began to retreat from life . Some of them , such as Wade Hampton and Senator Ben Hill , attempted to follow the old order of their ways , but even they were eventually forced to surrender . Any Southerner whose family history goes back to the war remembers stories of grandfathers or great-grandfathers who withdrew completely from the Yankee-inspired civilization , who never bast their hatred and resentment of the order erected upon the ruins of the one they knew and loved . It is hardly possible for us , looking from a point forward in time , to understand that hatred and resentment ; to comprehend the passion that caused one Confederate soldier , in his last will and testament , to bequeath to his children and grandchildren and their descendants throughout all generations , that bitter and everlasting malignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including all the people north of the Mason and Dixon Line . " It is equally difficult for us to understand , remembering their full and active lives , the retreat of the former leaders of the South into a half-world of memory and bitterness and contempt . One sees them in their days of moment and glory , in great and determined pride , and one sees them , later , living like hermits in the woods . " I would not care , " wrote Admiral Raphael Semmes in 1869 , " if I never saw a human being again . " And General Beauregard , out of work and growing old , confessed in a letter to his son , " I feel like an old pea that has dried in its pod . " Slowly , year by year , the social and economic pattern of the South was rearranged . By 1880 the rearrangement was complete . The middle class , consolidating its gains , had firmly esi tablished its position . There was no immediate displacement , however , of the old aristocratic leadership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white masses to those who had led them in the battles of war and a fear that division among the whites might involve a return to Negro or Carpetbag rule , was sufficient to keep them loyal , for a time , to their traditional leaders . But as they continued to grow in importance as a class , as individual ambitions grew greater , the fast diminishing leadership of the aristocrats began to be challenged . Then , toward the latter part of the century , after several years of depression that followed an era of post-war expansion like our own , their first leader arose . The Southern middle class , inarticulate so long , found its voice . It was the voice , roaring and blasphemous , of Benjamin Ryan Tillman ? later to be known , after he declared his intention of running his pitchfork into " that old bag of fat , President Cleveland , " as Pitchfork Ben , the Plowboy from Edgefield . Even yet in Edgefield County the Tillmans are remembered as violent men . They have become , with the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickness with a gun . Ben was one of four sons . Two of his brothers were killed in shooting scrapes and a third , a lawyer named George , had to flee the country after he settled a gambling dispute with a bullet . He managed ? and this is but one of the many untold stories of the South ? to escape to Nicaragua where he joined the famous Walker filibustering expedition . Finally he was captured and sent back to Edgefield , where he was sentenced to a term in prison . Ben , then a gangling boy in his early teens , used to visit him in jail . Often he spent the night in his cell . George , who had spent two years at Harvard , was fond of reading and had seen the world . Often , so the stories say , he would read to his younger brother , bending his heavy shoulders and serious face to the light of a candle , booming out in his tremendous voice the words of Jonson , Scott , Shakespeare , and Swift . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on , " I got from my brother George . " And those evenings in the county jail , those candle-lit sessions with the classics explain the curious Elizabethan strain which runs through nearly all his oratory ; as when , addressing an aristocratic gathering in Charleston , he shouted : " You are the most arrant set of cowards that ever drew the fresh air of heaven . " The Tillmans , despite their long American history , belonged definitely to the middle class . They were innkeepers , operating a hostelry that drew its trade from the travelers going from Augusta to Columbia . Ben , the youngest of the sons , was born in 1847 . He grew to manhood in Edgefield , spending his days as did most of the young men of his time , hunting or fishing or riding his horse about the country . At the age of seventeen , in 1864 , he suffered an injury to his eye which developed into an abscess of the socket . The infection spread and the boy , running a terrific fever , was 2izecl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an army r ficer , stopping at the Tillman inn or , sris way to the front , removed the eyeball and lanced the abscess . Ben 's life was saved but it took him two years to recover from the operation . After the war , in which he did not see service , Ben moved to a fourhundred-acre farm purchased by his mother when she sold the inn . From that time until 1886 he lived the uneventful life of a Southern dirt farmer . In the beginning , carried along by the rise in cotton prices , he prospered . Then , in 1873 , came one of the severest panics this country has known ; and in the wake of the panic , a period of depression , crop failures , and drought . The farmers , sinking farther and farither into debt , their farms mortgaged and their savings swept away , began to grow resentful toward the aristocratic ; leadership of the State . In their simple and direct fashion , knowing nothing of economics and caring less , they blamed all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had become interested in politics several years before , sensed their temper , and in 1890 decided to run for Governor of South Carolina . He made his campaign on a single issue : Turn Out the Aristocrats . " Say , you men who own the soil , " he cried , " how do you like this wet-nursing , this patronizing , this insufferable insolence ? How do you Iike being ruled by imbeciles and Bourbons ? The State is in the hands of drones and vagabonds , aristocrats and lawyers in the pay of high finance . This state of affairs leads straight to hell . " Politics in the South have always been taken like moonshine corn , but Tillman 's first race for governor was one of the bitterest and most acrimonious struggles the South had even seen , The Charleston News and Courier called him " the leader of a people who carry pistols in their pockets , expectorate on the floor , have no toothbrushes , and comb their hair with their fingers . " His enemies said he was an agricultural Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into rages of blasphemous fury . He poured out all the invective at his command ? classical and colloquial . And the farmers , hearing him say all the things they wanted to say themselves , all the anger and resentment that had been bottled up in them , flocked to his support . He was elected by an overwhelming majority . In his inaugural address , Tillman called his election a revolution . " Democracy , " he orated , " the rule of the people , has won . It has achieved a victory unparalleled in its magnitude and importance , and those who watched the abject surrender of our statesmen to the power of corporate money and class interests ? all such must sing out with joyful hearts . " After two terms as Governor , during which a few minor reforms were effected , including the limitation of hours of labor in cotton-mills to sixty-six hours a week , Tillman was elevated to the Senate . It was during his senatorial campaign that he threatened the person of President Cleveland and gained the name by which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retained until his death , he became almost unrecognizably docile . Sometimes he waxed , as he had in his early days , but in time even his roaring ceased . One is tempted to believe he was investigating his own psychology when , after a drink in the fashionable Columbia Club , he remarked sarcastically , " It 's a monstrous nice place . No wonder the cornbread and bacon fellows like it . " He died in 1918 , in the month of July . It was a dark time then , and the world was at war , and the newspapers had little room for him . He was an old man and his battles were behind him , and he belonged to an almost forgotten time . In any political history of the South , however , he must be given a place of great importance . He was parochial and of no great depth . but he introduced a new type of Southern politician , and , more significantly , he marked the beginning of a wave that has just now reached its crest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into being , rides Huey Long . IV Looking at the deep South to-day , that part of the United States which has most successfully resisted the assaults of modernity , one is struck by the fact that nearly all the persons in places of political importance have been carried to their positions by the upsurge of the lower middle class . These men , one and all , are demagogues , appealing to the passions and prejudices of the underprivileged , making promises they know they can not fulfill , beating their breasts and tearing their hair and crying , with all the power of their considerable lungs , that they are friends of the common people . In Georgia , busily engaged in creating his own little fascist state , is Governor Eugene Talmadge . In Mississippi , from which went Jefferson Davis to become President of the Confederacy , is Theodore G. Bilbo . In South Carolina , recently elected governor over Coleman Blease , who was the direct inheritor of Tillman 's mantle , is Olin D. Johnson . In Alabama , which gave to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ohltime Klansman and " prosperity maker , " Bibb Graves . From North Carolina comes Senator Robert L. Reynolds , and in Kentucky , turning out colonels at a prodigious rate , is Governor Ruby Lafoon . They compose an interesting , though hardly inspiring , array of statesmen . It has been my privilege , not unmixed with pleasure , to hear all of them , with the exception of Mr. Heflin and Governor Lafoon , enunciate their political philosophy . Some of them have been good enough to grant me personal interviews . They have all impressed me , though it is possible that I suffer from the prejudice engendered by provincial patriotism , as inferior imitations of Huey Long . They have his instincts but not his intelligence . They have his manner but not his perfection . It is inconceivable that any of them , unless we are visited by a succession of miracles , can ever attain any great national eminence . Mr. Long already possesses that eminence . His name is known to more people than that of the Vice-President . He belongs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . If he carries out his threats ? and it seems likely that he will ? we shall find his name on the presidential ballots of 1936 . I do not intend , partly for lack of space and partly because I dislike to recross ground I have already traveled , to write a detailed account of Mr. Long 's career . The essential facts are already known . He was born in a four-room log house in an upstate Louisiana parish in 1893 ; he was a book peddler , soap salesman , furniture salesman , patent-medicine salesman , and a cooking-contest organizer for the manufacturer of a lard substitute ; he studied for a time at the University of Oklahoma and Tulane ; he passed his .11 ! = ? -. = bar examinations and became a lawyer at twenty-one ; was elected four years later to the Louisiana Public Service Commission ; defeated for governor in 1924 , when he was squeezed between a Klan and a Catholic candidate ; elected governor in 1928 and , before the expiration of his term , named to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took office anticipated an unusual and unconventional regime , but their anticipations were in no way commensurate with reality . What Huey did , in effect , was to stride into the Governor 's office , take off his coat , put his feet on the desk , and spit tobacco juice on the walls . The office of Governor until that time had always been considered one of importance , to be accorded at least a show of outward respect , and the antics of the Kingfish ( an appellation taken , despite all the fables undertaken to explain it , out of the blackface radio program ) Left them shocked and aghast . Nor did Huey give them time to recover . He applied shock after shock , adding confoundment to confusion , until they , and his political opponents , were reduced to a state of impotent rage , and the rest of the country was laughing its head off . There was not a tradition or a ceremony he did not violate . He conducted the affairs of state from the bed in his hotel room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happened , coming out second best . He had reporters thrown from his room and was hit in the eye . ( It is his eye , for some curious reason , that always gets in the way . ) He surrounded himself with bodyguards , including one gentleman who would have gone far with Al Capone , and began to turn the National Guard into his private army of storm troopers . He created an international incident by receiving in a pair of green pajamas the Commander of a German battleship , and was showered with pajamas from admirers all over the country . He tore down the old Executive Mansion , one of the most beautiful examples of plantation architecture in the State , and supplanted it with a stone edifice that resembles a cross between a museum and a post office . When impeachment proceedings were started against him , he contrived to get fifteen State senators to sign a round robin that they would not vote for his impeachment no matter what evidence was presented . When he was elected Senator , the Lieutenant Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that he had abandoned the office of Governor , and took the oath of office . Huey , in New Orleans at the time , rushed back to Baton Rouge , threw a cordon of guards round the Executive Mansion and ordered that Cyr be arrested as an impostor . He appointed one of his underlings , then President pro tempore of the Senate , Lieutenant-Governor and then defeated Cyr in a lawsuit over the Governor 's office . Not once , though they tried time after time , did any of his political enemies succeed in outwitting him . He seemed to have good reason to boast , as he did on one memorable occasion when he did not appear to be extremely sober , " There may be smarter guys than Huey Long , but they ai n't in Louisianal " His attacks on the corporations and the vested wealth of the country continued ? despite charges , made by his own brother , that he had been involved in dubious transactions with some of his sworn enemies . He interspersed these attacks with tirades against the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hammered away at the idea that up until nine years ago Louisiana was a feudal State ruled by the money barons in New Orleans and on the big plantations . And he declared that he was going to write a new blue book of New Orleans society . His adventures became more and more fantastic . Some of his closest associates advised him that he was carrying things too far . And it seemed , not long ago , when he was again punched in the eye ( this time for committing a nuisance on a man 's trouserleg ) , that they were right . The battle of the Sands Point washroom was a crucial moment in Mr. Long 's career . It was a pretty disgusting performance and it seemed he might he through ? even in Louisiana . I , for one , did not think he would survive the incident . It was just that slight , unexpected accident that would break him . Instead of being broken , however , he has tightened his hold on the State . His rubber-stamp legislature , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the retinue of an Oriental potentate , has handed him more power than even he knows what to do with . The question arises naturally why the people of Louisiana tolerate such a state of affairs . The answer is simple : Huey is a possible good against a positive evil . It is a choice between Huey and the New Orleans gang , and Huey is simply the better choice to make . It is important to remember in this connection that he has made good on many of his campaign promises . He has built thousands of miles of paved roads ; principally in parts of the State loyal to him , it is true , but the roads are an improvement over the cow-pastures and gravel-pits one had to travel before . Free textbooks have been provided for the schoolchildren of the State . Telephone , gas , and electric rates have been cut ? not much , not nearly so much as Huey promised , but a reduction is a reduction , no matter how small . The State penitentiary has been made somewhat less barbaric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been abolished , giving the franchise to thousands of persons who never had voted before . It is true that the condition of the agricultural and industrial workers is as ball as ever , perhaps worse , that Huey is absolute dictator of the State , that Louisiana 's public debt of nearly one hundred fifty million dollars is the third greatest in the Union . But against free schoolbooks , the abolition of the poll tax , and reduced power rates , these things make poor political ammunition . You might try to convince a native farmer of Winn Parish that he is living under a fascist regime ; you might tell him that Huey ca n't possibly make good on his share-thewealth promises ; but he will not pay any attention . In the first place , the word fascism is not in his vocabulary , and in the second place , he knows that there is a paved highway where the old pike used to be and that his four children get all their schoolbooks free . So he may smile at you , for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in what you might take for agreement and then go down to the polls and vote for Huey again . It may be annoying , but that is the way he feels . And , at the moment , I do n't see how anything can be done about it . V During the past few days , in the early part of March , the air has been heavy with billingsgate , recriminations , brick-bats , and dead cats . Mr. Long , Father Coughlin , and General Hugh S. Johnson have been speaking their minds about one another . It is hard to tell who won the vituperation contest , but it would appear that the General , probably because he was outnumbered , came out second best . The various implications of their quarrel lie beyond the field of this essay ; but as far as Mr. Long is concerned , it is significant of his cunning and ambition that he took the first chance given him to address the nation at a " favored " hour to make his first out-andout bid for the Presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made on the basis of his Share Our Wealth movement . He explained that movement over the radio in detail for the first time , and we now have an opportunity to examine it and see what it means . We are not to imagine , however , that the plan is not subject to alterations . As announced over the radio , it bore but little resemblance to the original plan proposed in Mr. Long 's autobiography , and we may logically expect it to be modified or elaborated as time goes on . The only consistent thing about Mr. Long is his ambition . The plan proposes , first of all , to liquidate all fortunes of more than " three or four million " dollars . The possessors of such fortunes will be required , not to sell their holdings , but to transfer ownership to the United States Treasury . Long declares that this will return to the government some $170,000,000,000 . It next proposes ( with considerable vagueness as to how it is to be done ) to give every family in the United States a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approximate value of $5,000 . To do this , according to Mr. Long , it is necessary to spend about $100,000,000,000 . The plan further proposes a minimum wage intended to give each family a cash income of not less than $2,500 a year . As an attack on unemployment , it is suggested that the working week he lengthened or reduced each year in order to maintain a balance between production and consumption . When reduced , the industrial and agricultural workers thus freed would be employed upon governmental projects . With the $70,000,000,000 left over from the liquidation of the great fortunes , the plan proposes to give every child in the country ( provided he can show he deserves it by passing an intelligence test ) a college education ; the government , if necessary , supporting the student through college . Old-age pensions will also be provided for every United States citizen , beginning at the age of sixty-five , and the soldiers ' bonus will be paid in full . This , stripped to its essentials , is the Share Our Wealth plan . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of holes , and that its planks would make a leaky ship of state , is almost an obvious conclusion . Mr. Long is an economic ignoramus , still thinking of the nation 's wealth as so many poker chips which are to be piled on the table and redistributed among the players . He takes no cognizance of the instruments of production ? mines , railroads , factories ? by which wealth is produced . It is highly doubtful , furthermore , even if the great American fortunes were dissolved , that we should all be able to have $5,000 and a minimum wage of $2,500 a year . And , as has already been asked , what would the govern . ment do with its part ownership of industry ? Would industry be operated as part of a planned economy , producing necessary goods , or would the present chaotic condition prevail ? If so , people 's real incomes would still be insufficient . The problem is not one of merely redistributing the poker chips which symbolize dollars and cents but of producing income . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not occur , most likely , to the millions of persons to whom Mr. Long looks for support . I have just seen a picture in a New York newspaper showing him standing beside what looks like a ton of mail ? the national response to his radio address . It is too much to ask that the senders of these messages stop and consider whether or not his plan is feasible . Its very na ? vet ? makes it sound plausible , and plausibility goes farther in politics than economics . All of this leads directly to the question of the moment : What chance has Huey Long of becoming President ? I am not a political prophet , and I hesitate to guess ; but there are , according to The American Progress , Long 's weekly newspaper , five million members of the Share Our Wealth clubs . Divide this figure by half , or even a quarter , and you still have enough votes left to give any presidential candidate a running start . The Share Our Wealth clubs , incidentally , cost nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal . I do not mean to say that I believe Huey will become President in 1936 . I do not believe , furthermore , that Huey himself thinks he will win . His only purpose in running will be to bring about , if possible , the defeat of Mr. Roosevelt . What Huey thinks of Mr. Roosevelt is no secret ; even the semblance of friendship that existed up to the opening of the present session of Congress is gone . He labored hard for Mr. Roosevelt 's election ; he made speeches and carried the torch of the New Deal ; and now the agents of the Treasury Department are indicting his political comrades for evading the income tax and have even delved into his own affairs . Other things have served to alienate his affections ? the inquiry into the election of Senator Overton , the withholding of P.W.A. funds from Louisiana , the fight over Farley ? and Huey would derive considerable satisfaction from Mr. Roosevelt 's defeat . If Huey runs in 1936 , then , it will be with this in mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too clever a politician for that . He can feel reasonably sure of carrying Louisiana , Mississippi , Arkansas , and perhaps Georgia and Alabama , but that is all . It is also said in Washington that the disgruntled Northwestern Progressives , disillusioned with Roosevelt , will either put forward their own candidate or throw their support to Huey . In either case the Democratic vote will be split , and it is conceivable that a fairly strong Republican candidate ( if the Republicans can find one ) might possibly slip in . This , I doubt , remembering the enormous personal popularity that Mr. Roosevelt still enjoys ; but if Huey runs , it will be the motive behind his candidacy . In 1940 , however , the entire political picture will be changed . The Democratic candidate will not be Mr. Roosevelt and , if the depression continues , the Democrats will be in the same position as were the Republicans in 1932 . Huey , meanwhile , will have had four more years to rant and rage and to build up , with his Share Our Wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under those circumstances , more than an even chance .
