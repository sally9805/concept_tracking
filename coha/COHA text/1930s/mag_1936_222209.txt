One way to get around the U. S. laws against lotteries is to think up a high-sounding name for an organization , enroll " members " at so much per head , hold a " contest " in which they may win large cash prizes . Last week the Grand National Treasure Hunt , which sells $1 " applications for membership " in the Association for Legalizing American Lotteries , was just ending its third such contest when the Post Office Department clapped a fraud order on the scheme , barred the mails to its promoters . <P> If any outsider could claim credit for causing Catholic Postmaster General Farley suddenly to take notice of what had been mushrooming under his nose since last summer , it was Protestant Episcopal Bishop William T. Manning of Manhattan . One Sunday last month prim little Bishop Manning left his cathedral on Morningside Heights , drove downtown to deliver a sermon from the pulpit of socialite St. Bartholomew 's on Park Avenue . Topic of his preachment was lotteries and he was against them . <P> One of St. Bartholomew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of his sermon . When she heard about it , Mrs. Harriman declared to the Press : " I 'm glad I was n't at the service . I might have got up and answered him then &; there . I have deep respect for Bishop Manning , but I would like to call his attention to the fact that the first Episcopal church , near Cheshire , Conn , was built by a lottery . Bishop Seabury , grandfather of Samuel Seabury , conducted it . " <P> At the same time that the Post Office Department cracked down on the Association for Legalizing American Lotteries , it summoned two similar Manhattan organizations to Washington to show cause why they should not be also barred from the mails . One of them , the National Conference on Legalizing Lotteries , Inc. , has for its president Mrs. Oliver Harriman . <P> Mrs. Harriman , a onetime Louisville belle named Grace Carley , married a broker cousin of the late Railroader Edward H. Harriman 45 years ago , has since been a prominent Manhattan socialite . A large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame that millions of U. S. dollars are exported for the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and other foreign lotteries when they might be kept at home . People who agree with her to the extent of paying $1 to join her Conference automatically become eligible to enter a " Selection Sweepstakes . " Here they are called upon to display their skill and judgment by arranging in order of desirability a list of 16 ways the Government could spend the money it might raise by legalizing lotteries . For best arrangement : $20,000 . Other prizes total $40,000.
