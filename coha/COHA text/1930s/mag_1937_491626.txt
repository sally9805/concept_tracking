I WENT to Berlin in the fall of 1890 for the first time , having been engaged for a Philharmonic concert under the conductorship of Hans von Billow . I had been told that he had read my piano concerto and wanted me to play it with him . He came to the hotel to see me immediately , and said that he was looking forward with sincere joy to our performance the next day . I was to play my concerto and then a group of solos . These subscription concerts of the Philharmonic had very large audiences , and I had arranged my programs very carefully with that in view . I presented these programs for his choice . Von Billow , however . selected a group of solos which did not altogether please me . I felt in his choice a certain , shall I say , eccentricity . But I must abide by it . I had no choice . Two days later came the first concert , an afternoon affair , then known as a public rehearsal , which always took place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my reception was so spontaneous , so cordial , that I was delighted . After the rehearsal , Von Billow said to me  --  but in rather an angry tone , I thought ? " Do you know , I have never seen anything like it . before ? Your reception today was colossal . " I was delighted , but I noticed , at the same time , in his tone , something that hurt me . I felt it . Turning the Tables A FEW minutes later , during the intermission , there hurried into the hall the gentleman who was the head of a great musical agency . This man , as you may surmise , was the same Mr. Wolff that had refused to accept me a year before as one of his artists , just as he had refused , years before , to give me even standing room at the Rubinstein concert . The same great Mr. Wolff ! He was most agreeable and rather excited . He pretended , of course , not to have met me before . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have had an exceptional reception today . It is most unusual at a debut. , and you are going to have , without doubt , a phenomenal success tomorrow . You will now make a splendid career . I 'm delighted . And now I have a proposition to make to you . " He paused and we looked at each other ; it was a crucial moment . I know perfectly what was coming , and it was a thing of vast importance to the rest of my career . You will realize that at this time Daniel Mayer was my manager . He was a kind and honest man whom I liked very much , but he was in a very modest position then . He had not the connections or the reputation of Mr. Wolff . The latter was a power in himself , having his representatives in every country . He had a fine mind ; lie was clever . He was not only an exceptionally brilliant businessman but a highly educated man , and musical . He was a real connoisseur in art . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it represented a great deal . I realized this only too well , but my mind was already made up . I think Wolff realized this , too , but he went on very suavely . He said , " I now propose to you that under my management you will have similar success everywhere , not only in Germany but in every country in the world . I am sure of it . " He still ignored , you see , completely , our previous meetings . But I could not allow that and I answered : " When I was in Berlin last year , Mr. Wolff , before I had my present manager , Daniel Mayer , I approached you on several occasions and asked whether you could arrange some concerts for me in Germany , and you absolutely refused . Although I had had successes in Paris , Vienna , and even in London , still you had no faith in me , you would have none of me . It was not until this very minute , after the great ovation just given me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so it is your pleasure to come to me now and offer , so graciously , your management . You ask me to betray Daniel Mayer , who has worked for me so honestly , so devotedly , these past months . Do you think it would be honest ou my part to leave him , because you are now pleased to offer me some successes in a future of which you are so sure ? " " Oh , well , " he laughed , " that is business , my dear sir , business ! Do n't regard it so seriously . Join me now and you will be very glad you have done it . " " No , " I answered . " No , no I " For just a second , Wolff seemed taken aback , but he gathered himself together quickly and said , " But that is nonsense , Mr. Paderewski . Surely you do not mean it . This is a business proposition I make you , of the utmost importance to your career . Sentiment should not interfere with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again we measured each other with our eyes , and again I said , " No , Mr. Wolff . I shall not change my answer . It is ' no , ' and it is final . " Wolff simply stared at me a second , then shrugged his shoulders and said , " Well , it seems impossible , but if ' no ' is your answer , I must tell you very frankly that you will regret it . " Again we looked into each other 's eyes , then Wolff turned and left the room . At the moment I did not pay much attention to what he said . I only wished to be rid of him then . A Musical Massacre T HE next day , when I came to the hall to play , I found Von Billow in a great state of nervousness , even of anger . That upset me immediately . I could not understand how a man who had been as enthusiastic as he WAS the day before could so suddenly change overnight . How was this possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was late , which was ridiculous , because I arrived just before he had to conduct his first number . His anger and displeasure were unmistakable . It affected me deeply , and although it made me more nervous than usual , I can not say that his temper actually influenced my playing  --  no  --  but it certainly added greatly to my discomfort . But / was totally unprepared for the dreadful things that began to happen the moment I started to play . How I went through that concerto , I really do not understand to this day , because there were so many mistakes , so many errors on the part of the orchestra and the conductor , Von Billow . It was frightful ! It was a nightmare ! Everything was absolutely wrong on the part of Von Billow and the orchestra . It was a massacre . But bad as that was , I still had another ordeal to go through . When I began my group of solos in the second half of the program and started to play the Hungarian March by Schubert-Liszt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly jumped up , pushed his chair back and ran quickly off the stage and disappeared . Of course , it caused a stir in the audience . . People began immediately to whisper , and everyone became very restless and uneasy . Von Billow had completely destroyed the mood . It was almost impossible to finish the number . The audience ceased to listen . I played on somehow , but it was agony , indescribable . Von Billow , it seems , was famous for his ability to provide surprises for his listeners and to attract attention to himself and in that way hold the constant interest . of his audience . It was regarded in Berlin , to a certain extent , with amusement and tolerance , and even in his own recitals people used to say , " What is he going to do now ? What next ? " Unfortunately his antics , if I may use that word , did not always have very happy results , and certainly , in my case , it was a tragedy . When he ran from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the audience as a gesture against me . He did not care to listen . That 's what his going conveyed to everyone . The catastrophe was complete . And the cause of all this ? Ah , that I shall never know . As a result . of his leaving in the middle of my solo , some of the critics said that my composition was worthless : some others said that I played very beautifully the Nocturne of Chopin , which was the first number , then expressed deep regret that I played such a thing as that Liszt Hungarian Funeral March ! It was , indeed , a funeral march to my debut in Berlin . But some other newspapers treated me from a political point of view . They really attacked me and wrote most sarcastically . " Why does that Pole come here ? " wrote one journal . " What does he want from an audience like our Philharmonic Society ? He has no place with us . Because he wrote that little minuet , does he think he can impose upon us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous ! " I wanted to leave Berlin altogether , but my agent had made contracts for another orchestral concert at the academy and two recitals , and I had to play them . I had no choice . The audiences in all these other concerts behaved beautifully . There was great enthusiasm and I had to play encores . But the critics continued their attacks ; it was absolutely disgraceful . The mischief was complete . My publisher , Bock , was so unhappy about it . He said to me , " I can not understand it . I can not . Did you offend anybody ? What has happened ? " " No , " I answered ; " I am incapable of offending anyone . I treat everyone with due respect , because , first of all , I respect myself . " After my laist recital , I saw Bock again , and he still spoke of it with great bitterness . He said , " Well , it is all a great mystery , a great pity , but never mind , we must forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you come again , everything will be changed . Then you will have your revenge . " ' " No , " I said , " I shall never have my revenge , because I shall never come back , never . I shall never play in Berlin again . " And I have never done so . I have had offers which were just as brilliant and flattering as those in America . I have been invited even by the court , which was a tremendous distinction , considering the German spirit . I have played in almost all other cities of Germany , always with pleasure and success , but I have never played in Berlin again . In spite of all my political activity , for instance , even up to three years ago , I still had offers from Berlin , invitations from the government even , to come to play , with the assurance that I would be received with all the acclaim and honors due to me not only as an artist but as a statesman . I have always declined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A FEW weeks after the Berlin fiasco , I received a charming letter from Von Billow , reminding me that I had yet to come to Hamburg to play with the orchestra , because he was conducting these orchestra concerts also . I had to go to Hamburg , because there was a contract already made . I went there . He received me as a brother . He said , " Now you must come to me , to my house , and have all your meals with us . We will entertain you . You know , my wife is a Pole . She will he so delighted to have an opportunity to talk Polish with you , and I shall be very glad , indeed , to have you as my guest . Look here . Tell me what you best Like to eat . Is there any dish you especially prefer ? If so , we shall prepare it with pleasure . " " Oh , " I replied  --  most tactfully , I thought ? " at luncheon I must tell you that I prefer your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he cried . " Cannibal ! " Yes , Von Billow was delightful during that Hamburg engagement , and I had no more bitterness toward him ; it was all wiped away at that meeting , which proved to he the last . I never saw him again . At the time of my Berlin concert , the whole of the German press was convinced that whatever was approved by them must be recognized by the whole world . They had a great animosity against me because I had made a success first in Paris and London , without having had that stamp of perfection given me by the Berlin press . So they had to treat me like someone who had won a certain place in the world , bat illegitimately . My first season in London , preceding the Berlin fiasco , was a success , and ( Continued on Page 59 ) ( Coneinued from Pup. 541 But there it was . It might be that the crash had done something to him , stung some old atavistic nerve that refused to take any more punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . I could n't blame him for wanting to hang on to Sophie , for she was the most beautiful thing God ever made , but I did n't exactly admire him for it . He told her that she was going to stay his wife and she 'd better take that as settled , for the present anyway . That was when I got them interested in clearing out of London and leasing Harrow House for the season , but being in the country did n't seem to make things any better ; it only gave them more time to think up things to say to each other . Sophie had begun to talk of going back to the stage , and that made Archie see red . I supposed it was something about the stage that she was going to put up to me , though I did n't see why she could n't wait till after the ball . However , eight o'clock was all right with me , so I took a tramp straight down over the moors and swung myself up over the wall ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed out of the way if Archie or Jan had been about . And then I saw Viner standing there , his back to me , watching the door into the house , I 'd never liked Viner ; I 'd seen him hanging about Sophie in London , and there was something about the fellow and his assurance that made me sympathize with Archie in the contempt he 'd always shown him , I thought Sophie had been a fool to be as pleasant to him as she was . Viner did n't hear me coming up on the wall ; he just stood there , watching the door , and the next moment Sophie came out of it , all white satin and bare arms , and moved toward him . She never looked up , she never saw me. proved its reality in many ways . Contacts were established then that went on through my life , And first of all in the place of honor and in my heart , I put my two godmothers , Lady Barrington and her sister , Mrs. Yorke . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of the present Duchess of Portland . The family held a position of great power . It was her sister , Lady Barrington  --  who , thank God , is still alive , though she is eighty-seven years old  --  who gave me constant opportunities to meet British statesmen and contributed so much to my career . It was through her that something happened which was of vast consequence to the welfare of my country a few years afterward . That was my meeting with Lord Balfour , one of the noblest and loftiest souls I have ever known . At a later moment in my life he played a tremendous role . In an ago of wise and splendid men he stood apart . And it was a wonderful age , a golden era . It was a great flowering of that English civilization . It was during my second tour that I was invited to play before Queen Victoria . But before I tell you about my concert at Windsor , there is something to be said about the fashion then of playing in private houses in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't hear , and the next instant he put out his arms and grabbed her up to him . I do n't know what got into me , but I bad a pretty strong feeling for Sophie , I suppose  --  stronger than I knew  --  and the fellow 's cheek in making a pass at her made me hot . I went over that wall and was leading out with my right before I saw the rest of the picture . Then I saw that Sophie 's bare arm was up about his neck and her face was against his . She had come to him . It was too late to stop my swing , even if I 'd wanted to . It caught him under the jaw and he crumpled , sagging forward , his head drooping , and she held him up  --  she was strong for all her slightness . Over his head , those black eyes of hers blazed at me . " You fool , Chet ! Go away ! Go away ! " I was as stunned as Viner . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched him . It was revelation , all right . I 'd never dreamed she 'd cared for anybody but Archie ; she 'd always sworn his jealousy of her was senseless . I 'd thought that if he only had the sense to give her rope and let her go away for a time , she might come back to him . I must have stared very stupidly at her with all the avenging knight leaking out of me like sawdust ; then she said , panting a little under Viner 's weight , " Get away from here ! Get away ! " and I went away . I went back over the wall and up the moor to the manor , and all the way I was choking on it . Then the telephone rang , and I had to go down to Jan . When Jan told me Viner had died , I could n't believe it . I had to hold on to myself to keep from saying something queer . I tried to think fast , but I could n't figure it out ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage , and he had n't fallen backward , for Sophie was holding f Continued from Pairs 271 The At Homes were very popular , and played rather an important part in the season of every artist who came to London . Although they were financially satisfactory , or , I should say , became so , they were not altogether an unmixed blessing . It was a form of entertainment that wits not considered very seriously by the guests . Alas , even the charming hostesses did not regard the event as a concert . I used to feel that they just engaged the artists to permit the company to talk . 1 resented it to such a degree that on several occasions I was bold enough , and rude enough , to stop playing entirely and then apoke-ize to those engaged in lively conversation for having interrupted them . When they began to talk , I would stop . And as I was not very well acquainted with the language  --  I was just starting my studies in English  --  I usually spoke to them in French . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your conversation . I deeply regret . that I am obliged to disturb you , so I am going to stop for a while now and allow you to continue . " You can imagine the effect it had . I actually accomplished two things then , and I claim the credit for it . First of all . I educated those fashionable audiences in how to listen to EVENING POST him up . The way she felt about him , she was n't going to let him tall . I could n't make sense out of it . It was Jan 's panic about Archie that made me wait to hear what I could and made me feel that other blows than mine had been struck that night . Archie might have come out and found them together and let fly at him in earnest . But that did n't make sense , either , for then Archie and Sophie would hardly have gone dashing off to a ball , leaving Viner flat . I had to come back to the thought that they had left Viner there , drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to go , he 'd toppled over . That was why I could promise Jan that Archie would never be convicted of anything , for if there was any trouble I knew I 'd have to come forward and tell my story . I did n't want to unless I had to , because it might have been his drinking that made him slip and not my blow at all ; and besides , that would drag Sophie into it . If I knew Archie at all , I was sure he would n't want that . That would he worse than having people think that Viner had just got drunk there and toppled over by himself . The best thing , I thought , was to sit tight and see how people took it . That was a lot better than getting in wrong from the start by lugging the body all over the place , but Jan changed all that by being so desperate about it . If we got away with it. , of course that cleared Archie ; but if we didn't. get away with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  first delivering the blow that might have caused the accident and then disposing of the evidence . I did n't know how responsible the English courts would hold me for that blow , but I thought it might run to a nice long stretch of rock breaking . ( To BE CONTINUED ) music and the proper attitude toward an artist .. Secondly , I accomplished another thing for the benefit of my colleagues , because I raised the prices for these private appearances everywhere . In London , at that time , a fee of sixty guineas was the highest . price paid for an At Home . I am not speaking , of course , of Adelina Patti , who often sang privately . She always received a really tremendous fee . People would pay anything to get . her . There was another singer , Madame Albani , an American , who was a great favorite and got as much as one hundred guineas . But that was exceptional . Well , I played the first season for sixty guineas . Then I asked two hundred guineas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my concerts increased , I was not in such need of earning extra money and could , therefore , dispense with the At Homes , and I was only too thankful to be able to refuse them . It was not much of a pleasure , even under the best conditions . There was always noise , certain moving of chairs , and little irritations that were impossible to avoid in a house , and quite understandable . On some rare occasions , yes , it was a pleasure , but in many eases it was ( Continued on Page 61 ) Maned/need from Pare 591 really a kind of slavery  --  to play just because one is paid for it . On certain occasions when royalty came during my playing , the whole audience stood up , of course , and I had to stop , and I also bad to how before the King or Queen , or whoever it was that entered . So I then raised my price to five hundred guineas to make it practically impossible to engage me . That was unheard of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . The conditions were such then that , for instance , even in America , when an artist was engaged , he was not allowed to enter by the front door , but had to go to the side door , like the grocery boy . I had that experience myself once in New York . On arrival , 1 was led by the servants to the back entrance . After I had recovered from my amazement I refused to go through the back door , and returned to my hotel . Of course , immediately somebody was sent . to me with humble apologies , and I returned and found a small regiment of servants at the front door to usher me in , with the lady of the house waiting to receive me , overcome with embarrassment and full of futile explanations . How absurd it all seems when one looks back upon it now . Concert for Queen Victoria It was in 1891 that Queen Victoria had expressed a desire to hear me play . So I went to Windsor . It happened that the Queen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall in an invalid chair . She addressed me in beautiful French and impressed me as being a queen in every sense of that often-misused word . There was such a majesty enveloping her . It was an actual part of her very presence . I was surprised to find that she knew so much about music . Whatever she said was just to the point . Her taste and education were classical , of course . She was supposed to have been a pupil of Mendelssohn for a certain time  --  such is the legend  --  so her favorite composers were either before or during the period of Mendelssohn 's life . I had to arrange my program accordingly , A year or two afterward , I was again invited to Windsor , and received still more kindly and graciously by the Queen . On that occasion she presented me with her picture . She seemed older and feebler , but still a sovereign in every way . She was a wise queen  --  wise and fortunate . The only musical person in the royal family after Queen Victoria was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in listening to music . I met her first through your beautiful American , Lady Randolph Churchill . who asked me to a luncheon and then told me that the Princess of Wales was coming specially to hear me . There I met this charming lady who afterward became Queen of England . Beautiful as she was , she talked to me in such a way as to make me actually shiver with fright , because I did not understand one single word she said . She was pleased with my playing and invited me to come to her and play again . We must speak now of the next great event  --  perhaps the greatest  --  that brought me to America , the country of my heart , my second home . This was of colossal importance , and I felt ready to face even the terrors of the Atlantic . America then , as now , was a promised land to all European artists , a land of fantastic and fabulous legend , with money and appreciation flowing out to meet the artist , from the great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayer secured an engagement for me in the United States . The tour was arranged under the auspices of the house of Steinway &; Sons and was to be managed by a member of that famous firm , Charles F. Tretbar .. But before going there , I had to prepare a very large repertoire . I was aware of the fact that I should have to play many recitals in New York , Boston and Chicago , and several orchestral concerts too . I was asked by Mr. Tretbar , who was arranging my tour or eighty concerts in America , to submit to him a list of all my repertoire . Fortunately , it was already large , but I had to work very hard for several months to refresh my memory and consolidate my fingers . The list that I sent Mr. Tretbar contained quite a number of pieces of which I was not so absolutely sure at that moment , and quite especially of the concertos with the orchestra , hence this extra work . Anyhow , I started my preparations for the American tour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized very clearly that it was the moment . to make quite a little fortune . But it was also a risky step . A guaranty  --  thirty thousand dollars  --  was offered for the eighty concerts , and Tretbar had already sold many of these concerts in advance.You know , the house of Steinway was not a concert agency , but a great piano firm , and they had no intention of making money with my concerts ; their object was the advertisement of their piano . So it was stipulated in the contract that whatever I might earn over and above the figure mentioned would belong entirely to me . It was a charming generous contract . Before my departure , I had to play a few concerts in England , but those few concerts turned out to be quite a large tour of thirty-eight piano recitals given in a little more than six weeks , because I was then en route for America . I was not pleased with that , but the tour was advertised . New York of the Nineties Therefore , I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer called The Spree , which was a misnomer , decidedly . I was not going on a spree  --  far from it ! I sailed on the third of November , 1891 , and the journey was frightful . It was my first experience as a sailor and I was in agony most of the voyage , which seemed endless . When I finally landed , New York was far from being that land of mountains and shooting towers illuminated so brilliantly and making such an overwhelming impression us now . There were only small dirty low buildings near the wharf . We arrived at night . The impression was rather sordid and depressing . Darkness everywhere . How different now . A few people only at the dock , as the steamer was not an important one . The night was gloomy and rainy and cold . Mr. Tretbar came to greet me , but his greeting was in accord with the weather . He , too , was rather cold and severe . After the customary greetings , he said a few words which actually made me shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you have had brilliant successes in London and Paris , but let me tell you , Mr. Paderewski , you need not expect anything like that here in America . We have heard them all  --  all the pianists , all the great ones  --  and our demands are very exacting . We are not easily pleased here . So , as a beginning , I want to warn you now that we already have here pianists of big reputation and remarkable talent . Their demands are modest because they know that piano music is not so well rewarded as singing or even violin playing . So you should not , I repeat , expect extraordinary houses . Although I have done my best for you , it is nothing very remarka.ble . " Well , that was a blow to me . Mr. Tretbar 's fateful words destroyed my last faint hopes . There was to be nothing left for me over and above my guaranty , and I had dreamed of a richer harvest . But there was nothing to be done , as I was under contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was met by discouragement on every side , and at this first moment when Mr. Tretbar was so graciously welcoming me , I was so depressed , so discouraged , that I asked immediately when the next steamer would leave for Europe . My one thought was to return , I was in despair . I could see no ray of light at that moment . 49 Barnstorming Role Immediately upon arrival , we went to a hotel in Union Square , and that first night I intended to run away from the hotel . Wherever I looked , in every corner , there were spots black with a mass of insects . I did not know what they were . I had never seen anything like them before . Then , there were mice in the hotel too . I spent a dreadful night . Mr. Tretbar , it seems , naturally , wanted to make the expenses as small as possible , in order to save money . Early the next . day / sent word that I could not . live in that hotel , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . The reply came at once , " Of course , if Paderewski is not comfortable , then he must go to another hotel . " So my secretary replied , " Mr. Paderewski says that if another and better hotel is too expensive , he will pay the bill himself . " " No , " they said . " Oh , no , we have made our contract and we must abide by it and provide him with every comfort . " Rooms were obtained for me at the old Windsor Hotel , It was then one of the biggest buildings in New York . It was four stories high . A very old-fashioned but comfortable hotel with good food , at Fifth Avenue and Forty-ninth Street . But discouraging as my greetings were at the pier , they were nothing compared to what I learned when I got the plan of the tour . I had imagined that it would be graduated ; at first starting with a Few concerts , then a little rest. , then more concerts , and so on . But , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two between  --  a continutms tour  --  and I had to begin in New York with three orchestral concerts , at which I had to play eight piano concertos in one week and a group of solos . It was incredible ! Eight piano concertos ! Who ever heard of such a thing ? I found myself repeating it over and over again , " Eight piano concertos , eight piano concertos ! " I WaS simply stunned . True , I had five of them prepared , but they were not , in my opinion , ready for public performances . Why , in Europe I would not . have played eight concertos in one season ! The dreadful knowledge of what faced me had a paralyzing effect . it was superhuman . I longed for the earth to open and swallow me up . I must add here that after the week of eight concertos  --  already advertised  --  I had , in addition , to play six recitals . These recitals were scheduled for the following two weeks , which meant practically a concert every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time at Carnegie Hall . Walter Damrosch was the conductor . He was a very young man at that time , and he gave me a great . deal of pleasure as a conductor and as an accompanist . As an organizer and a progressive figure in the musical world , he has contributed since then very much to the progress of music in America . There were two concertos and a group of solos at that first convert . It was very well received , but not yet any kind of sensation . I was severely criticized in some papers ; in some others , highly praised . It was not a phenomenal success  --  no , They waited for the second concert . But for the second concert , I had to make the rehearsal the morning after the first one , and I was not yet prepared . I want now even at the risk of repeating myself , to say that the average person , or the great public , let . me say , has no idea of the amount of practice necessary  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It . is not sufficient to know and to play well , or even beautifully , the numbers arranged . It is not sufficient to have played the same program the week before , and even to repeat it the next . day , without incredible hours of practice and concentration . And so it is with every performance  --  hours of practice and mental work  --  and all this in addition to the never-ending finger practice  --  shall I call it the technique ? I was overwhelmed with the sheer physical aspect of the task before me . Youth was on my side , and an unbounded ambition and will to conquer , but I am still paying in flesh and blood for my first New York season , and you shall soon see why . Practicing In q Warehouse I Found that I could not practice in the Hotel Windsor , because it was full of old people , residents , who would not tolerate music at night , the only time I could work . So I went to Fourteenth Street , to a piano warehouse . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the door , how startled the night watchman looked , and I must have presented a strange appearance . There I began my practicing in that great gloomy loft . There were no lights except . the two candles on the piano . It must have been a strange sight as I think back upon it  --  the empty room , with two fluttering candles and the two men , the night watchman and my secretary , each snoring loudly in his eJrner as I worked on until morning . That was all I had for inspiration . I practiced five hours that night  --  after my concert , remember  --  and I prepared the concerto and was ready the next morning for rehearsal at ten o'clock . After the rehearsal , I practiced again all day for the concert . How did I do it ? Ah , I can not tell you how I endured it . But the second concert , in spite of my fatigue , was much better than my first . one . There was a larger attendance and a real demonstration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which I could not have gone again that night to the warehouse and prepared for the third concert . I was to play the Rubinstein Concerto and the Chopin E Minor Concerto and the Liszt Hungarian Fantasia . It was an afternoon concert , and it had taken me seventeen hours of the one day to practice . My arms were dropping off . But I could not have rest . I could not cancel or postpone the concert  --  impossible . So I played that Rubinstein Concerto , and the reception was really remarkable , tremendous . That was the real beginning of my career in America . Carnegie Hail or Nothing There was a very large sum in the box office , too , so large that Tretbar said , " Well , it is surprising , what you have made in this concert . " There was , I think , about . three thousand dollars in the box office . They had never had that sum before  --  never . Two days later I gave my first recital . Preoccupied with the responsibility of my concerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first recital would take place  --  in Carnegie Hall , I supposed , and only on the day of the concert was I told by my secretary that it was in the small hall at the Madison Square Carden . " But , " I said , " this is wrong ; this is impossible . There is some mistake . Why , I have just filled Carnegie Hall . Why am I put in this small hall now ? " I simply was told : " Mr. Tretbar has arranged it . " I was outraged . It was wrong , illogical , unfair , and so 1 expressed myself , Tretbar came at . once to see me , and I told him what I thought of it all . He had many excuses , of course , but I out them all short and said , " It is unworthy of your house . " William Steinway , head of the firm , was , unfortunately for me , ill at . that moment and there was no one to whom I could appeal . Tretbar would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our policy and we can not change it . You are under contract and will have to play in the hall we have arranged for . " I was caught in a trap ; there was no escape . I gave my first recital . I think it went very well . I had arranged my program very carefully , reserving the very best and most brilliant pieces of my repertoire for the last three recitals , which I was sure I could arrange to have in Carnegie Hall in spite of Mr. Tretbar and other difficulties . At that first recital , I looked out at the hall very particularly . It was not full , but that did not disturb me , in spite of the fact that Mr. Tretbar came to the dressing room to see me , smiling rather sarcastically , I thought. , even triumphantly , and said : " You see , this small hall is quite large enough for you . I told you how it would be , and you must realize now that you were mistaken . " But I said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better attended . The public , especially those who were at the orchestral concert at Carnegie Hall , when seeing the announcement that my first recital was to be in a small hall , had the impression that the management had no great faith in me . So they did not come . Such was and still is my belief . But the third recital was crowded . People were turned away . That day Tretbar made no comments about the size of the audience . It was a great triumph and I felt myself on solid ground at last . I said to my secretary , " Now , this is the end . I am not going to play any more . I shall break the contract . They may make a lawsuit , they may do anything they please ; I will not again play in that small hall . I will go back to Carnegie Hall or I shall not play in New . York at all . " Well , the message was taken to William Steinway himself . He decided at once that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can imagine my relief . It showed his clearsightedness and great sense of justice . A splendid man and loyal friend to the end of his life . My last three recitals were at Carnegie Hall and were a great . success artistically and financially . The last two were completely sold out . I would have been very happy then , but I was exhausted and in such cruel pain that every concert was an agony for me . During that first American tour , Mr. Tretbar managed all the concerts , acting somewhat as a great field marshal , sending out his orders , but never moving from New York himself . The general in command was a man appointed by Trethar , hired by him to execute his orders , an Englishman , a very fine , charming old fellow by the name of O. C. Fryer . He was the practical manager and was present at all my concerts . In other words , to put it simply , he did the work . Manager Into Artist After my first season Tretbar satisfied himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he who invited all the critics to a big supper after my first concert in New York , at which I was to make the personal acquaintance of the gentlemen of the press . I still preserve very pleasant recollections of that evening . I remember particularly Mr. Philip Hale , a famous critic , later of the Boston Herald . He was a highly cultured man and very witty . His criticisms were sometimes sardonic and there was always some little personal remark , but all my recollections of Philip Hale are very sympathetic . But there was something in me that always shocked him  --  that was my hair ! He could never get accustomed to it . The position of manager is a curious one psychologically . You know , in some cases  --  which is natural enough  --  a manager often actually becomes the artist , at least in his own mind . He is so used to arranging and managing affairs in speaking for the artist , that he , even in his telegrams , also in conversation , sometimes speaks of himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little comment on that . Copies of telegrams used to come to me signed with my manager 's name , saying , " I refuse to play on such and such a date , " or " Yes , I accept . I will play at such and such a concert . " Even others associated with me did it after a time . It was contagions , you see . When I first saw one of these strange telegrams , I was dumfounded . Fryer brought me the first one , and I asked him what it meant . " Oh , " he staid , " that is just a custom . It means nothing . All managers do that . It is a Ithid of habit they get into . You know , we managers get to feel that we own the artist , and sometimes , " he said laughingly , " sonic of us even think we are the artist . " Afterward I became a bit more accustomed to the idea , but I think I resented it a little . But it always ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 ) amused me , in spite of that . My good old friend Stengel  --  the husband of Madame Sembrich , and her manager  --  was a great offender in this respect . I heard him , many times when Sembrich had to appear , or refused to appear , say , " Oh , yes , I am going to sing tonight , " or , " I have a cold and have refused to sing tonight at the opera , " or , " We are singing next Monday in The Barber . " It always made me laugh . So absurd ! I remember one particular occasion  --  the great celebration of Sembrich 's thirty years or so in the opera . There was a supper in her honor and many distinguished people made addresses . I was asked to speak , too ; so I thought. , " Now is the time to make a little facetious comment on this strange managerial habit . " After opening my speech with the usual introductions , and so on , I said that it was with special pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not her husband , as I had been led to believe when I heard him , a few days before , say to a comrade , " We are singing at the great banquet . tomorrow night , " and added , " I have derided to sing Schubert 's Nussbaum , It is such a favorite . " Of course this created great laughter , and Stengel himself was delighted . I t hen went on and elaborated my theme . I said , " I have heard him , so many , many times , say , ' I am not going to sing tonight , ' or ' Yes , 1 am singing tonight , ' that I can only say I came in great trepidation , fearing that he act wally would sing tonight . " More laughter . " But , " I added , turning to Madame Sembrich , " thank God , he is not going to sing tonight ; it is Madame Sembrich herself who is to appear . " The Boston Symphony Life has a. way of repeating itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so kind to me and I was immensely struck with the con , tant hospitality and friendly feeling of ihe American people . The whole Ameri  --  an life was of a vitality and freshness unlike anything I had ever known . The mimes of hundreds of interested and kind people flock to my mind  --  all a part of the audiences that welcomed me throughout the land . Many of them became close friends as the years went on . After the first New York season , I went to Boston and had at once a great success . I already had friends in the Boston Symphony Orchestra , the Adamouskis ; then , too , Nikiseh , the conductor , whom I knew before in Europe . All this made my first . appearance there much easier than in New York . And the Boston Orchestra was magnificent . It surprised and interested me extremely to find two great orchestras in America  --  in fact , we should say three , including the Chicago Orchestra . But the Boston Symphony must always be mentioned first . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played such an important part in the musical life of the country . Major Henry L. Higginson was its patron saint , and he supported it until his death . The real foundation work was done by Gericke . He was the most perfect driller  --  there is no better word for it . He demanded perfection . He made it such a homogeneous body through that constant drilling and unceasing work . Arthur Nikisch followed him . I have known many splendid conductors , but the closest to my heart was Arthur Nikisch , whom I first met in Europe . His was a most sympathetic personality , a strong emotional interpreter for every kind of music . Ho was not a specialist ; he was an all-around , great musician . One could not always agree with him , but one was bound to recognize his absolute authority , sincerity and brilliancy . It was a pity that he bad to leave the Boston Symphony . He disagreed in some respects with Major Higginson , and that was most unfortunate . Higginson made great sacrifices to establish and maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was some misunderstanding and , as a consequence , Nikiseh left , and was immediately invited to Budapest as a director of the opera . A Wandering Minstrel To be quite frank , I must add here that the greatest pleasure I derived when playing with the orchestra was when I played in Boston and other places with Earl Muck . He became conductor of the Boston Symphony orchestra in 1900 and remained there two or three years . It was simply indescribable , the perfection of his accompaniment . When the war came and America entered it , he was finally put in some detention camp . He could not hide his feelings then , which were pro-German . As my tour drew to a close , I was more and more eager to get home . I suffered so much from overwork and the unbearable pain in my arm , and then , also , the whole business and financial side of my tour was difficult . Mr. Tretbar had sold many of the concerts to various agents throughout the country , for as little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it possible for me to make any additional money through such an unfair arrangement ? But there it was . I played in Philadelphia for three hundred dollars  --  an orchestral concert with the hall packed . Such a small sum was unheard of , even for an unknown artist . In Chicago I played in the Auditorium on New Year 's Eve 1891-1892 , and on New Year 's Day , before a packed house , at three hundred dollars a performance . Theodore Thomas was the conductor . That was a very impressive concert for me . I looked forward with eagerness to playing with Thomas , but my time , owing to the contracts made by Tretbar for many concerts in quick succession , was so taken up that I did not arrive in time even to rehearse with him . I reached Chicago in the morning , and at 2:30 that same day had to play with the orchestra . I had never seen the hall , never heard the orchestra and never even seen Thomas himself . Just before the concert , I was closeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the concert with the usual symphony , and after it was finished , as I stood waiting my entrance , I saw a gentleman with a little wig hurrying from the platform , looking eagerly around him . " Paderewski ! Where is Paderewski ? " he cried . " Here I am . " " Well , " he said , " I am very glad to know you . " We shook hands . " And I am delighted to see you , Mr. Thomas . " Then , without further ado or delay , he put his hand on my shoulder and said , " Well , conic , let 's go and play , " and he turned quickly and we walked on to the platform together . That was all . It was really remarkable  --  no fuss , no delay ; just , " Let 's go and play . " But one had immediate confidence in hint He was a splendid conductor , with authority and refinement and intuition . A musician by the grace of God . Four thousand people filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ever had . Since then I have had audiences , perhaps , five times that aims before me , but at that time it made a stupendous impression , a great thrill . Well , I must ray that Thomas loved me at once . It was love at first sight on the part of both of us . He asked me afterward how I dared risk my appearance at . a first concert without a rehearsal , without even knowing him or what he would do . How had I the faith and courage to attempt it ? I answered him straight from the heart . " It was simply an instinct , " I said . " I knew  --  absolutely knew  --  it would be all right . Although I had never seen you . I knew I could trust you . " " I shalt never forget that , " he said , putting his hand on my shoulder , " I shall never forget it . " After Chicago , I went to Milwaukee and played my first two recitals there . Again it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars for each recital . But there was something still worse to come . I had to return to Chicago , where I was booked for three recitals in one week , and each one sold for five hundred dollars . These recitals were extremely well tit tended ; the house sold for more than three thousand dollars . Tretbar , it seems , even before my arrival in New York , had sold these three recitals for this ridiculous sum . It distressed me deeply . It was a disastrous and shocking experience to me . It was especially hard at that moment because I suffered dreadfully with the pain in my arms . Only a pianist with a large reputation can realize what it means to play , for instance , eight performances in three weeks . When one is just beginning his career , the academic side of the performance must be absolutely correct , and that correctness is very dearly bought always , because it means continuous practice . At that time I actually worked seventeen hours a day . I allowed myself just an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , that was hard labor , and felt it , not only then and immediately but for more than forty years afterward , and I can say now that I am still feeling the effects of those superhuman efforts . I had already played in all the important cities , but in many of the smaller places my first appearance , naturally , was not attended by large audiences . Suddenly there came a change . It happened in Portland , Maine . / saw , to my great surprise , that the hall was completely filled . There was actually a demonstration . Practically the entire audience rushed behind the platform to shake hands with me . Everyone shook hands so cordially that after that experience my right hand was swollen twice its size . I was told that it was due to extraordinary publicity I had just received through the Century Magazine , at that time edited by my friend Richard Watson Gilder . In the latest issue there had been a poem by him called How Paderewski Plays . It made quite a sensation . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , Dr. William Mason , then recognized as the first musical pedagogue in America . I have , unfortunately , to confess that it did not make me feel very happy at that moment . The pain in my right hand and arm was increasing . There was a reason For this . The Steinway pianos , although marvelous instruments , had a certain peculiarity which was dangerous for concert players . Their action at that time was extremely heavy and fatiguing . The Steinways were willing to change the tuition , but their workmen , who already had a certain routine , were the decided enemies of any innovation . They fought it . Those workmen , the regulators especially , were convinced that what they were doing must be accepted as perfection ; that they did not have to adapt themselves to the wishes of a mere artist , but that the artist should adapt himself to the piano . The actual physical strength required to produce a very big tone was almost beyond the power of any artist . The controversy began , and it . meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the action was changed on the pianos used by me . My piano then , with all its beauty and power , became gradually quite docile , It was no longer my enemy ; I no longer bad to fight it . We were friends . This change , made during my tour , gave me tremendous relief . Then , suddenly , disaster befell me through an accident from which I still suffer to this day .
