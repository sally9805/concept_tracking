Three years ago Mrs. John Gasparotti , wife of the chief engineer of the City Ice &; Fuel Co. of Moberly , Mo . ( pop . 13,772 ) got an idea for a novel . Mornings , after her four children were off to school , she hustled through the housework by 9:30 , wrote until a lunch deadline at 11:30 . Afternoons she could sometimes squeeze in a couple of hours more . The book soaked up distractions the way butter soaks up the flavor of fish in the icebox . Odd-moment writing gave her prose an odd-moment style . <P> But in three years , two rewritings-a period as hectic as one long house cleaning-Mrs . Gasparotti got it to come out right and sent it off under her maiden name , Elizabeth Seifert , to the Dodd , Mead-Redbook Magazine $10,000 novel contest . The day the news came she had won , she and the children " just sat down and looked at each other . " That night her husband " did n't sleep a wink and I did n't get much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Gasparotti 's prizewinner , Young Doctor Galahad ( Dodd , Mead , $2.50 ) , readers could admire not only her industry , but a good piece of popular fiction as well . The story of an idealistic young doctor in a small-town hospital-not Moberly , protests Author Seifert , although " I can not get people to believe it " - Young Doctor Galahad is better than the usual run of popular fiction because of the author 's earnestness . <P> She knows hospitals and doctors- before her marriage she worked in St. Louis hospitals-and she has definite ideas about the social role of the medical profession . Her hero 's two love affairs are not very convincing and Author Seifert does not count too much on them herself . But when he is fighting small-town bigotry to introduce syphilis clinics , to put a murderous abortionist out of business , and , in a novel happy ending , to put across an experiment in socialized medicine , the story moves with a commendable and lively amateur freshness .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
