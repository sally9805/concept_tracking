The Chamber of Deputies passed the Foreign Office budget for 1933 last week . U. S. correspondents noted the fact , then prospected for news nuggets through page after page of official specifications . A 175-page supplement caused their hair to curl . Leonine Foreign Minister Joseph Paul-Boncour had demanded and got an additional appropriation of 33,000,000 francs ( $1,320,000 ) for French propaganda abroad . In the introduction to his demand he explained that nine European Governments annually spend the following sums ( in francs ) in foreign propaganda : Germany : 256,000,000 ( before Hitler ) Italy : 119,000,000 France : 71,000,000 Britain : 69,000,000 Poland : 26,000,000 Hungary : 23,000,000 Czechoslovakia : 18,000,000 Jugoslavia : 13,000.000 Rumania : 7,000,000 Most of the new propaganda fund , the document explained , was to be spent in combating anti-French sentiment in the U. S. It added : <P> " Among the preliminary steps to be taken is the speeding up of the study of the Hearst newspapers to permit prompt reply to anti-French attacks . . . . <P> " The American people go to no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple truths . ... An American may honestly ruin his best friend just to prove he is the stronger , then offer him his hand and help him to arise . Friendship has nothing to do with business . . . . The American people are ignorant of their own history . They must not be expected to know French history . . . . <P> " The American feminine element has an important viewpoint ; we must address ourselves particularly to it . ... It is vital that young , good-looking and active speakers be sent to the United States instead of unhealthy , decrepit , tired , feverish , wornout , coughing and trembling ancients bound into frock coats . These have to be put to bed upon their arrival with hot water bottles at their feet , have to be awakened just in time for a conference , and when rushed to a station thousands of precautions have to be taken . That is why France is pictured as a tired , worn-out country . " <P> In spending the 33,000,000 francs , M. Paul-Boncour , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listed other points beside the hiring of muscular young lecturers able to cope with the U. S. cocktail party : <P> 1 ) Furthering of French motion pictures . <P> 2 ) Sunday night broadcasts via the British station at Rugby . <P> 3 ) Subsidizing pro-French articles in U. S. magazines by prominent authors . <P> At the end came a cracker : " These inquiries have allowed us to establish a general basic plan to be undertaken in the near future ... by collaboration with the Associated Press and the Havas news agency . . . . The Quai d'Orsay assures the technical and financial control of this news service . " <P> Red with embarrassment and anger , Associated Press officials hotly denied that they had been bought or intended to further official French propaganda in the U. S. Other news services privately teased but not for a second did they doubt A. P. 's integrity . They realized that persuasive <P> M. Paul-Boncour was simply over interpreting an old working agreement between A. P. and the Government-controlled Havas agency .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
