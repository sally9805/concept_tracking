Important members of the New York Stock Exchange have been going to Washington quite frequently in the last two years . One day last week Washington went to the Stock Exchange . On a self-financed week-end junket " to inspect the different things in New York we Legislators are legislating about , " 100 Congressmen &; wives trooped into the visitors ' gallery , eyed the brokers ' antics with astonishment . President Richard Whitney tried to explain what was going on but the junketing Congressmen soon left to see 90 tons of gold in the Federal Reserve vaults , to visit Ellis Island on fireboats . <P> Meantime in Washington last week it became clear that the rolling barrage of protest against the bill to control stock and exchanges was beginning to tell . For the first time since the bristling measure was introduced last February , Congressional comment was offered without the tired phrase , " with teeth in it . " The people 's representatives reported that on some days they received literally sacks of objecting mail , not all from brokers and businessmen but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee such innocuous sections of the bill as the declaration of public policy ( with which even President Whitney of the Stock Exchange found no fault ) were centres of rousing wrangles . Alert to the wind 's way , Senate Majority Leader Robinson last week called the bill " very extreme , " adding : " I believe we will pass a stockmarket bill which will not damage anyone excessively and still be effective . " Speaker of the House Rainey said : " I have n't talked with many Committee members but I understand there is an awful demand for revision . . . . There is considerable talk of liberalization and I think this can be done without destroying the efficacy of the plan . ' ' * <P> Most widely condemned features of the bill are those sections which deal not with stock exchanges but with corporate affairs . Such provisions as those handing the Federal Trade Commission broad authority over financial reports and regulating stock transactions of officials and . large ( 5% or more ) stockholders have been tempered but little in the revised drafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important feature dealing solely with the brokerage business-margin requirements - was last week officially slated for revision . The man who turned the margin tide was the Stock Exchange 's oldest and ablest foe-Lawyer Samuel Untermyer . <P> The counsel to the pre-War Pujo money trust investigation , had spoken of the bill 's original draft as " impossible , impracticable . " Testifying before the Senate Committee last week , the aging attorney criticized many provisions as deflationary and indiscriminate , found numerous glaring omissions . Roundly he denounced a fixed formula for margin requirements , urged instead discretionary power in the hands of the central credit body , the Federal Reserve Board . The Senators and their counsel , Ferdinand Pecora , were impressed .
