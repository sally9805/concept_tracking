SHORTLY before the stock market crash of October , 1929 , there was published a two-volume book entitled &cent; Economic Changes , which contained the findings of a group of business and economic leaders known as The President 's Committee . The book reviewed the developments of the previous seven years . The Committee was extremely optimistic . It stated that these years had been " splendid beyond all human experience . " Of the future it predicted : " Economically we have a boundless field before us ; there are new wants which will make way endlessly for newer wants , as fast as they are satisfied . " A portion of the book was devoted to a consideration of the practice of selling goods on installments . This practice had increased enormously during the period under review . Four billion dollars ' worth of new business had been created . The time-payment plan made possible the ownership of luxuries by people who would otherwise have been obliged to go without . The President 's Committee stated : " The use of installment credit was a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified in recalling these matters except for one reason : the depression that set in so shortly after the publication of the optimistic findings of the President 's Committee has been unexpectedly slow in righting itself . Directly following the stock-market debacle many business executives , including members ofthe President 's Committee , predicted that normal conditions would return within sixty days . Others , more conservatively inclined , suggested that a full resumption of prosperity might not take place until the following spring . No one , so far as I recall , expressed publicly a belief that the depression might continue a full year . Did the policy of installment selling , which the President 's Committee stated was a " means of lessening sales resistance , " have something to do with the unexpectedly slow return to normal conditions ? Is it possible that the executives who predicted an upturn within sixty days forgot about the four billion dollars ' worth of unpaid installment contracts ? Has business been obliged to rest on its oars until people who mortgaged their earnings a year or more in advance should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? These questions are particularly pertinent at the present time when so many business executives are taking stock of conditions and laying plans for the future . If installment selling brought about seven years of prosperity that were splendid beyond all human experience , then it would seem that installment selling is a good policy for business to pursue . But if installment selling prolonged the ensuing depression , then it is not so good a policy . One must go back to the panic of 1907 to find a business situation which will serve as a basis for estimating how much , or how little , installment selling may prolong a business depression . The panic of 1907 was in many respects similar to the panic of 1929 . It was the result of an over-production of goods . It also took place at the end of seven years that , for those times , were " splendid beyond all human experience . " Practically the only difference lay in the fact that in 1907 only a small amount of business had been done on the installment plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total retail business of the country . According to Government estimates , installment debts in 1929 amounted approximately to two hundred and fifty dollars for each family in the United States . In 1907 I had a retail store on Washington Avenue , the main street of Newport News , Virginia . Newport News was considered a " good " business town . More then 7000 men were employed in the shipbuilding plant and in the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway terminals . From the standpoint of retail trade there was but one serious drawback . The city of Norfolk , several times larger than Newport News , was only fifteen miles distant , and the round trip could pleasantly be made for fifty cents . Norfolk 's shops were larger than ours , and many of our citizens were accustomed to go to Norfolk to trade . It was to combat this tendency that a year or so previous to 1907 the Washington Avenue storekeepers organized the Newport News Retail Merchants Association . Our Association was sincerely capitalistic in its point of view . Though there was no President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I make bold to say we pursued our ends with considerable acumen . We stressed the fact that it was the duty of Newport News people to spend their money at home . This point could be argued upon an extremely highmoral plane . Every Newport News dollar that was spent elsewhere meant just that much less support for Newport News schools and churches . Particularly the churches , which were maintained by voluntary subscriptions , Were not Newport News people entitled to worship on as high a scale as the people of other cities ? No one could deny it . A part of every dollar spent in Newport News went to the support of some Christian denomination . That being the ease , how could any conscientious person strike a blow at religion by spending his money with out-of-town merchants ? In only one respect did the members of our Association fall behind modern standards in breaking down sales resistance . Scarcely any effort was made to sell merchandise on installments . Had we realized it , we were in a most fertile field , because men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were seven thousand such workers walking past our stores each day . On Washington Avenue , there were but two merchants who sold goods on installments . Both of these were furniture dealers . I believe there was a general feeling that installment selling was not quite dignified ; it was looked upon also as a rather risky and uncertain project . When our Association discovered that a Norfolk jewelry merchant was sending a man to Newport News once each week to solicit installment purchases of diamond rings and gold watches from shipyard employees , we merely talked of trying to bring about the salesman 's arrest for peddling goods without a license , instead of making a scientific study of his methods and adapting them to our own uses . The panic of 1907 broke upon the country out of a clear sky in the month of October , following the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company of New York . It is often referred to as a " money panic , " and it was indeed that . For a time currency was so scarce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most urgent necessities . In some communities manufacturers were allowed to draw only enough money to meet their payrolls . Newport News was in a particularly alarming situation . Both our great industries were obliged to reduce their payrolls drastically , and there was no telling how far the reduction might go . The men who lost their jobs generally left town to look for work elsewhere , because there was no chance for other employment locally . The holiday trade on Washington Avenue that year was lamentably small . But the real crisis on Washington Avenue occurred directly after New Year 's , when the merchants ' obligations to their wholesale houses fell due . Most of us had stocked up heavily , expecting a continuance of the prosperity that was " splendid beyond all human experience " ; and January found us with a great deal of merchandise on our shelves but with very little cash to pay for it . Many of the wholesalers to whom we owed money were themselves hard pressed and in no position to extend our debts . Yet not a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help out those who were in difficulties . I myself was one of these . It was with some misgiving that I went to the First National Bank to lay my case before the cashier . I am sure Mr. Willett does not remember the interview . Still less , I imagine , has he any idea that he made a remark which hears cogently on the theory of time-payment merchandising : " The Bank will loan you what you need to pay your bills . You 've got the merchandise on yourshelves , have n't you ? That 's all the collateral we require . " What , I wonder , would have happened in 1907 if I , and my neighbors on Washington Avenue , had put our merchandise out on time payments ? Would the banks have been as liberal with us if , instead of merchandise on our shelves , we had only installment contracts signed by a multitude of wage earners , many of whom had lost their jobs and had left town to look for work elsewhere ? If , as in the crash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt of two hundred and fifty dollars for goods bought on the installment plan ? I am afraid that under such circumstances an industrial town like Newport News would not have recovered so promptly . It is still a matter of pride in Newport News that its first apartment house was planned and construction started during the most acute period of the 1907 depression . It was , after all , a business man 's panic . The general public was not in debt . The working man who held his job could go ahead and buy things for cash as usual . The man who was so unfortunate as to lose his job was not tormented by the thought that the sheriff might come after his partly paid for wash boiler , or his electric stove , or his wife 's wedding ring . Nor was he tempted to commit a dishonest act and leave town with things he had not paid for , letting the installment dealer whistle for the money . Installment selling on a large scale did not begin until the depression of 1921 , when radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had accumulated . Manufacturers in many industries arranged to finance their dealers for installment sales . The expedient proved extremely successful , and it was estimated that outstanding installment contracts amounted to more than three billions of dollars by 1926 . There was a strike of Pennsylvania mine workers that year , and investigators were sent into the anthracite region to learn how installment selling affected a community which was undergoing such a business depression as had been brought on by the strike . The investigators ' findings were later printed in the Bulletin of the National Retail Drygoods Association . It was stated that installment selling had aggravated the business collapse in Wilkes-Barre , Scranton , and Carbondale . Automobile dealers had repossessed so many cars that a large exposition building in Wilkes-Barre was used for storage of such machines . Charity workers found many bare cupboards by the side of easy-payment talking machines , furniture , etc . The report ended with this comment : The situation in Pennsylvania lends weight to the belief that the abuse of credit through present installment practice will cause the next business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the case . Appended to the report was information of a more sinister nature . The investigators stated that a great many people had run away from their communities and taken with them their partly paid for installment merchandise . The investigators ' comment was : " It is unsafe to place too much faith in the honesty of American people . " The President 's Committee states that installment selling has lessened sales resistance . Perhaps it did more than that in the Pennsylvania coal country . Prior to the strike a great many mine workers had been induced to buy more than they could pay for . When bad times came it was easier to run away with the merchandise than to give it up . Is it possible that while installment selling was lessening people 's sales resistance it was at the same time lessening people 's honesty ? Perhaps if we find out how much it costs to sell goods on installments we may have a better idea of whether or not the installment plan tends to prolong economic depressions . Not long ago an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . A number of leading house-paint manufacturers combined to promote the idea under the slogan , " Good News to Home Owners-10 Months to Pay . " The plan called for the co-operation of hardware merchants throughout the ' United States . Any householder who wished to redecorate his house could apply to his local hardware merchant , and the latter would supply the paints and arrange with a painting contractor to do the work . When the job was finished the householder paid one-fifth of the agreed price in cash and signed ten notes for the balance . It was , apparently , a splendid arrangement for everyone concerned . The householder was charged only nine per cent above the cash price . Assuming the cash price , for example , to be $300 for painting a house , the householder paid $S27 on the installment plan . The hardware dealer who sold the paint did not have to wait for his money . He sent the householder 's ten notes to a finance company . The finance company mailed the hardware dealer a check . Yet with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of violent opposition from associations of hardware dealers . Inasmuch as these merchants apparently stood to gain by selling house-painting jobs on the installment plan , what were their reasons for refusing to co-operate ? The principal reason , as announced by the National Retail Hardware Association , was the excessive price charged the householder . In a letter sent to its members the Association stated : " When great industries compete with each other for larger sales by educating consumers to buy credit at 20 per cent to 30 per cent interest cost , the situation deserves serious thought . " How did the National Retail Hardware Association arrive at its conclusion that interest cost was " 20 per cent to 30 per cent , " when the promoters of the Good-News-to-Home-Owners campaign expressly stated that the householder was charged only nine per cent ? The explanation is very simple : the householder who bought a $300 job of house-painting on ten months ' time did not get $300 worth of credit . He paid $60 as soon as the job was finished . The most he owed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , and at the tenth month he owed only $24 . But he had to pay interest on $300 for the entire ten months ! Mr. Rivers Peterson , who is editor of a hardware magazine and also one of the owners of a hardware business in Muncie , Indiana , figured out . the precise cost of the house-painting credit and wrote : " Installment buying costs the consumer an interest rate of about 25 per cent . The more money he pays for interest the less he has left to pay for merchandise . " I do not suggest that the manufacturers who promoted the Good-Newsto-Home-Owners campaign deliberately overcharged householders for credit accommodation I believe their finance company made only a reasonable profit when it exacted 25 per cent for cashing the householders ' notes and collecting the ten installments . The finance company assumed a certain amount of risk . It had to pay salaries to bookkeepers and commissions to bill collectors . And then , it did not always get its money when it was due . Ten months to pay usuallymeans that some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever been in the bill-collecting business knows only too well . But this does not alter the truth of Mr. Peterson 's statement that the more money- a citizen pays for interest the less money he has to buy merchandise with . If Mr. Peterson 's hardware store should go into the installment house-painting project it would charge its customers a dollar for seventy-five cents ' worth of paint and labor . The other twenty-five cents would go out of town to the finance company . Mr. Peterson , then , would reduce the buying power of his own customers . If all the merchants of Muncie should simultaneously begin to vend their wares on installments , the buying power of everyone in Muncie would he reduced . And if , on top of this , a general business depression should take place , it is quite likely Muncie would be longer in recuperating than if everyone had bought for cash and received a full dollar 's worth of merchandise for his dollar . If it costs a home owner 2,5 per cent for credit on a house-painting job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a store and buys a washing machine , or a fur coat , or a ukulele , or a radio set on installments ? The cost of credit varies somewhat , according to the article purchased . But all installment operations have one thing in common : When an industry goes on an installment basis the cash price tends to rise to somewhere near the installment price . To illustrate : I am , let us say , an electrical goods merchant , and among other things I sell washing machines . The washing machine business is done largely on installments . I have one splendid machine which I sell on installments for $100 . But an occasional customer comes along who does not care to buy on time payments and so , to get his trade , I put up a sign in my store , " Ten Per Cent Discount for Cash . " When I sell this customer a washing machine for $90 I am charging him too much . If I were fair with him I should sell him the machine at $25 less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. 5 to sell a machine on installments when I figure the expense of bookkeeping , the wages of my collector who goes around to collect the monthly payments , and the occasional machine which I have to get the sheriff to repossess for me when the purchaser does not make his payments . I know all these things . But I do not dare to offer a cash buyer more than ten per cent discount . If I did , I could not sell my machines to installment buyers . I have to make them believe they are paying only a little more than the cash price . My advertisement in the local newspaper , " I Trust the Public , " would be flung in my teeth a dozen times a day by indignant would-be installment purchasers who learned that I trusted them but charged them twenty-five per cent for the compliment . The President 's Committee stated that installment selling lessens sales resistance . This is undoubtedly true . But I think the Committee should have gone farther and explained that installment selling also penalizes people who wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . At the time the Committee was preparing its report a number of business publications printed this news item from Washington : Consideration of the propriety of the growing practice of selling all sorts of merchandise on the installment plan is being forced upon several Government departments . But cash customers should not be burdened by the cost of the installment system . One Government department to-day is receiving complaints of thepractice of selling for cash at the same price as for deferred payment ; this is considered bad . IV Many economists claim that installment selling justifies itself by increasing sales . But some manufacturers can not sell their products on installments . These manufacturers are severely handicapped by the extension of installment selling . The window-shade industry is a case in point . Recently one of the largest window-shade manufacturers in the country ? a corporation capitalized at many millions of dollars and employing several thousand people ? conducted an investigation to learn why its volume of sales tended to remain stationary at a time when other industries were enjoying a prosperity that was beyond all human experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of the country . Merchants who did a cash business were generally glad to push the sale of window shades . But merchants who sold mainly on the installment plan were reluctant to do so . A great many of the latter would not handle window shades at all . This was particularly the case in the retail furniture trade . A furniture dealer can afford to take a chance on selling a sideboard or a bedroom set on installments to anyone who wishes to buy , because these things have a resale value if repossessed . But window shades have no resale value . They are of no use to anyone else once they are installed in a home . Therefore , many installment dealers prefer not to sell window shades . One of the corporation 's investigators wrote , " In many industrial sections I saw new automobiles standing in front of houses , and heard radios going inside the houses , but at the windows were old , dilapidated shades or no shades of any kind . " The same thing applies to numbers of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar against the industries which can readily sell their products on installments . Shoes , men 's clothing , textiles , hats ? all these found the going difficult during the years when the President 's Committee stated that prosperity was beyond all human experience . The laws in force throughout the country tend to promote installment operations . In all but three states ? Louisiana , Missouri , and Ohio ? an installment merchant has only to get his customer to sign a conditional contract which specifies that the purchaser does not own the article until all installments have been paid . Fortified by this document , the installment merchant can " pull " articles with comparative ease . One of the window-shade investigators reported seeing in a store in Tennessee a piece of household furniture that had been sold on installments and repossessed from Negro families no less than sixty-seven times . This is known in the trade as " borax " selling . Another example was that of a Mexican day laborer in San Antonio , Texas , who had in his adobe shack a set of dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Mexican had a wife and several children and earned $1.50 a day , it was evident he had done business with a borax merchant who hoped only to collect two or three payments and then " pull " the merchandise . These of course are extreme cases and concern merchants and customers of a low social status . But , as the President 's Committee states , installment selling lessens sales resistance ; and this applies also to social grades much higher than that of the average Negro or Mexican laborer . A gentleman writes me from Indiana that he recently witnessed a case in which " a furniture van backed up to a house onmy street that is tenanted by a young man office worker , his wife , and three children . The employees of the furniture store entered and began loading the van with the furnishings of the home . While this was in progress the young man drove up in a large automobile that he had just bought . A heated argument followed ; but in the end the van rolled away , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile that might similarly be replevied the following week . " An industrial life insurance company reports a case in Rochester , New York , concerning the death of a man who had been regularly earning $60 a week as a high-class steam fitter . But the steam fitter had bought on time payments an automobile , a piano , a radio set , a fur coat for his wife , and other articles . The weekly installments on these things amounted to $63 . As his budget left nothing for house rent or groceries , he had been obliged to skip about half his payments each week , and always there was an unseemly race between the installment collectors to see who should be first to get to the steam fitter when he came home with his pay envelope . By making payments every second week , he had managed not to have any of his purchases " pulled . " When he died his widow received a check for $1500 from the insurance company ; but this left her still some $700 short of the amount necessary to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar financial arrangements , she said , " I guess we did n't realize what we were doing . Everywhere we went someone urged us to buy something on the installment plan and offered to let us have it with such a little down payment that we could n't resist . They said it was the modern way to save money . " There has been a tendency in this country to promote installment selling by making it appear noble . One writer refers to it as " an act of faith . " Thrift and service are words often used . Professor Irving Fisher of Yale , for example , goes so far as to say that " the American practice of installment buying is a distinct aid to thrift " ; also , that " the essential service is in the fact that the individual secures an immediate enjoyment of goods which could not otherwise be obtained until the future . " President Hoover has been quoted as saying that the policy of installment selling is " the backbone of continuing American prosperity . " It is hardly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time-payment plan . A man finds it a splendid means of securing articles he wishes without the hardship of saving up the money in advance . He may also indulge the emotional feeling , backed by the authority of eminent persons , that when he buys on installments he is helping his fellow-men to higher standards of living . But , putting emotion aside and speaking in plain business terms , how can you increase prosperity by forcing the sale of articles this year that will not be paid for until next year ? The answer is , you ca n't . It is merely a synthetic prosperity until you have sold your customers up to the limit of their credit . Then you have to shut down your factory until your customers have paid off some of their installments and are once more a safe risk . You really hurt prosperity because , if you have to charge your customers twenty-five per cent for the privilege of buying on installments , they have just that much less to spend for goods . Then there is a side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said installment selling was the backbone of prosperity . Is prosperity really worth while that depends on getting every family in the country into debt two hundred and fifty dollars ' worth ? Is n't a man undermining his character just a little when he buys regularly things on installments instead of saving up the price in advance ? I believe he is . I believe , for example , that the Rochester steam fitter was a more upstanding citizen in the days before he tangled himself up so heavily in time-payment contracts that the collectors raced to his house to see who would be first to reach his pay envelope . There is also the matter of the time-payment contract itself . When I buy my radio set on installments , the dealer does not take a sporting chance on me . He makes me admit that I am not honest enough to give him back the set in ease I find myself unable to pay . He insists that I sign a paper giving him a right to take the set away from me and even to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Installment selling has never attained great popularity in European countries . Recently in Belfast , Ireland , I inquired of an automobile dealer if he sold on installments . He answered that he did ; that his installment sales amounted to about ten per cent of his total volume . In the United States the figures are practically reversed . It is said that about eighty-five per cent of all cars here are sold on time payments . In England there is some installment selling , but it has never become quite respectable . It is regarded , I should say , about as it was regarded in the United States in the early nineteenhundreds ? as something that first-class people do not go in for . English installment houses recognize this and invariably state in their publicity that patrons need not fear neighborhood criticism because , " All purchases are delivered in vans that do not bear the name of the firm . " The English installment merchant 's best prospects are naturally among people of small social standing . In London during the past year I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat for a guinea on installments ? a shilling with the order and a shilling a week for twenty weeks thereafter . He intended to advertise his bargain in small country-town newspapers . As it was impractical to hold a mortgage on such an article , he would sell his raincoat with no strings attached , trusting that most of the country people who bought would be honest enough to complete their payments . Lunching afterward with an English business man and his wife , I chanced to mention this project . The business man 's comment was made from the commercial standpoint . He said , " The scheme is perfectly safe . The raincoat merchant will make money . Not more than ten per cent of those country people will lie down on their payments . " But the Englishman 's wife saw it from another standpoint . " It 's bad , " she said indignantly , " whether the merchant gains or loses . Some of those country people will find it hard to pay , and so they will just stop sending in their shillings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have done a dishonest thing . The whole scheme is a shameful undermining of the honesty of a lot of simple English people ! " In France there is a special law to control installment selling . A French installment dealer can not , as in Great Britain or the United States , ' retain title to an article until it is paid for . When an article changes hands the title goes with it . If I , for example , sell a radio set to a person and deliver it to him , the radio set is his , even though he has not paid me anything on it . To be safe , I must assure myself of one of two things : either that my customer is financially responsible for the amount , so I can sue him in the courts and get my money ; or that my customer has such a reputation for honesty that he will bring me back my radio set in case he finds himself unable to meet his payments . French law is so strict on the subject that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my customer , and so keep the title in my own hands . Yet there is considerable installment selling in France . Flourishing installment houses exist in Paris and in numbers of provincial cities , and in a suburb of Lyons there is a very important mail-order concern which sells on installments throughout the country . Bicycles , household furniture , and electrical goods are the principal installment merchandise . At one time the Belle Jardiniere , a Paris department store , advertised men 's clothing on time payments ; but the newspaper columnists and music-hall artists of the metropolis found it such an irresistible source of drollery that the plan was laughed out of existence in a few months . As the French installment dealer can not " pull " his merchandise in case the customer refuses to pay , he naturally chooses his customers with great care . The Lyons concern claims that its credit losses amount barely to one per cent . It also claims it sells on installments at prices that are only eight per cent higher than those of ordinary department stores . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down of sales resistance to the point where a man is tempted to tie himself up with more installment payments than can be met by the cash in his weekly pay envelope . This may , incidentally , have something to do with the uniformly good times France has enjoyed since the War . Business there has never been obliged to rest on its oars until people who mortgaged their earnings in advance had time to pay off their installments and start over again . When the United States numbered its unemployed by the millions , France reported less than a thousand men out of work . V As I said at the beginning of this article , a great many industrial executives are at the present time considering what their future policies shall be . Many of them , evidently , remember how their industries were revived in 1921 by installment selling and plan to work that policy even more intensively than in the past . Mr. H. J. Greil , Vice President of the Commercial Investment Trust Incorporated , a New York concern which finances radio installment sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is a time for unreasoning timidity . " A writer in Business Week reports that in some instances public utility companies are " seeking to speed sales by reducing the down payment and extending the time allowed for installments . One company is passing out electric refrigerators costing $200 or $300 for a down payment of only $10 . " In Detroit installment merchants have used full-page newspaper advertisements that urge the buying of Christmas gifts with no down payment . The purchaser may begin to pay on February first , " when the automobile factories reopen . " But it is extremely unlikely that business can be revived as it was in 1921 , by installment selling . At thattime the public generally was not in debt , while now the average family installment debt is $250 . It is even likely , if installment selling is made still more easy , that the next depression will be more violent and last longer than any past depression . No one will argue that installment selling is an unmitigated evil . If the abuses are eliminated it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal abuses are " borax " selling and the high-pressure pushing of goods on people beyond their ability to pay . I might also mention the practice of forcing an installment purchaser to sign a contract that makes him admit he is not quite honest . There is a very simple way to eliminate these things . Already in some States there has been talk of passing laws similar to those in force in France , which make it impossible for a vendor to hold title to an article after he has delivered the article to his customer . Far be it from me to recommend the passing of more laws when we have too many laws as it is ; but such a statute would go far to eliminate dangerous overselling . Credit would be a dignified matter , depending on the purchaser 's known reputation for honesty rather than on a threat of sending the sheriff after him . It would also give the manufacturer of window shades and textiles and shoes a better chance as against the manufacturer of dining-room furniture , fur coats , and electrical appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
