For six centuries Russia tried and spectacularly failed to conquer Finland before Alexander I won it from Sweden in 1808-09 . Alexander had two big advantages : 1 ) he made a deal with the Swedish gentry in Finland promising them self-government ; 2 ) he waited until February to begin his invasion , when the Finnish lakes were frozen fast and he could bring up supplies by sledge . Even then it took him 19 months to quiet the Finns . <P> Russia 's Joseph Stalin began his invasion last fortnight with these advantages reversed . Instead of a disgruntled ruling class , he faced a nation which , almost to the man , hates the Russians as bloody oppressors. * And instead of clear weather and frozen lakes , Joe Stalin 's forces found themselves fighting in a blinding blizzard , which grounded aviation , smashed tanks against half-concealed boulders and granite tank barriers , and gave to the Finns , who fight guerrilla-style in small units , with short , light machine guns and short , razor-edged knives , an almost even break . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians , who had thought they were starting a Blitzkrieg , were still hammering desperately at the Mannerheim defenses in Karelia , while in the north ( the only section they had succeeded in penetrating deeply ) their supply lines were dangerously lengthened . <P> Surprised by the cleverness of Finland 's preparations , Russia 's press exploded in wrath . Wrote Nikolai Virta in Pravda ( from Terijoki , where Russia has set up its joke People 's Government ) : " When our tired men wanted to drink , they found all the village wells filled with earth . . . . Hardly had the first Red fighter set foot on Finnish soil when an explosion rent the air-a mine ! Mines are everywhere . " Even the Russian soldiers were indignant . Writer Virta quoted one as saying : " What cads ! . . . They are masters of foul play . How well they make such nastiness ! ' 1 <P> Isthmian Drive . Even more nastiness was in store for the Russians-especially in the Karelian Isthmus , historic gateway into Finland and the one Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were roads , bridges and buildings mined-even a new bicycle left leaning against a fence was a detonator-but the Finns had utilized the geographical peculiarities of their country shrewdly . <P> Lowlands had been flooded , augmenting the chain of lakes across the isthmus and leaving only narrow strips of land between the lakes as passageway for invaders . This land , wooded and boulder-studded , was a natural anti-tank defense , to which the Finns had added long lines of jagged , diamond-shaped boulders , three deep , as their main lines of defense against tanks . Above the narrow roads other huge boulders had been poised , so that the mere cutting of a cord sent them hurtling into the road . Concrete pillboxes , sunk into the earth and covered with sod , guarded all main avenues of passage . In the thick fir forests hid the Finns themselves , trained since childhood to use their knives as cleverly as an Alabama Negro uses his razor , and since joining the Army to aim their machine guns as accurately as a sharpshooter aims his rifle .
