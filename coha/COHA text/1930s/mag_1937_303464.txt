One day in the bleak , jittery summer of 1932 a 19-year-old Negro communist organizer named Angelo Herndon led a hunger march of unemployed on Atlanta 's courthouse . A few days later he was arrested , held for eleven days without charges . Then Atlanta prosecutors dusted off a Reconstruction law providing the death penalty for " any attempt ... to induce others to join in any combined resistance to the lawful authority of the State . " In all its 66 years no one had ever been convicted under that statute . Chiefly on the evidence of communist pamphlets found in his possession , a Georgia jury found Red Herndon guilty of violating it , got him an 18-to-20 year sentence on Georgia 's chain gangs . <P> Overnight , obscure Angelo Herndon became a front-page communist hero , his freedom a prime Red Cause . Released on $7,000 bail provided by the International Labor Defense , he marched up &; down the land addressing Red rallies while I. L. D. lawyers fought his case through the courts . Twice Georgia 's Supreme Court affirmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case back to Georgia because of improper presentation , then took jurisdiction . <P> This week Mr. Justice Roberts became something of a communist hero too when , siding again with the Court 's liberal wing in another 5-to-4 decision for social justice , he read an opinion setting aside Angelo Herndon 's conviction . Finding no evidence that the young Negro had attempted to incite an insurrection , he declared Georgia 's application of its musty law a flat violation of the " guarantees of liberty embodied in the 14th Amendment .
