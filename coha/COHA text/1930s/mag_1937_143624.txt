One of the more famed U. S. lawyers is quick-tongued John Francis Neylan , for long William Randolph Hearst 's chief attorney and at present counsel for badgered Herbert Fleishhacker , top-flight San Francisco financier &; businessman . Lawyer Neylan was not in a happy mood last week . Not only had he and Client Fleishhacker just lost one damage suit in San Francisco ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) , but Federal Judge George Cosgrave , hearing another damage suit in Los Angeles , was handing him many an adverse ruling in testimony . Suddenly exasperated Lawyer <P> Neylan snapped : " It is quite apparent to me that some unfortunate personal attitude on my part irritates your honor . I have attempted to be most respectful . ' ' <P> Judge Cosgrave : " I am not criticizing Mr. Neylan personally . Apparently we went to different schools and think differently . As it happens , I am the judge . " <P> Lawyer Neylan : " In view of the importance of the issues to my clients , if my personality is offensive to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antagonism on your part . I would be glad to retire from the case . " <P> Judge Cosgrave : " This is the most astonishing statement I have heard . There is nothing personal here . As judge of this court , I merely rule upon questions as they arise . " <P> Judge Cosgrave presently ruled upon the whole question of the suit : Had Herbert Fleishhacker damaged certain Lazard Freres heirs by selling certain oil lands belonging to them in Kern County , Calif , in 1915-17 for too cheap a price ? Deciding that the answer was Yes , Judge Cosgrave ordered Herbert Fleishhacker to pay damages of $300,000 . He then sent compliments to Lawyer Neylan for his handling of the case . Comparing himself to Emile Zola defending Dreyfus , Lawyer Neylan stormed back : " I am serving notice now on all those behind the present litigation against Mr. Fleishhacker that I am going to bring them into the open and I am going to clear his name if it takes the rest of my professional life . ... I also take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I estimate at less than nothing his compliments . . . . "
