When Franklin Roosevelt submits his 1939-40 budget to Congress next month , U. S. taxpayers will learn what he has in mind for Rearmament . Meantime , it be came apparent last week that Rearmament talk has been liberally larded with balder dash . <P> Franklin Roosevelt himself dished up something that looked like balderdash . At a White House press conference he conveyed the contradictory ideas that military spending must be on a pay-as-you-go basis and that this does not mean that the U. S. must Pay in the same year that it Spends . On top of this , he declared that pay-as-you-go Rearmament does not necessarily entail new taxes . Since the U. S. is still running whopping deficits , the implication was that Rearmament must replace some other form of spending , but the President went on to say that military spending is to be solely for military purposes , and not for pump-priming or re-employment . <P> So confusing was this mlange that White House Secretary Stephen Early afterwards undertook to clarify it . In doing so , he volunteered the most revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Early , has not decided whether to expand Rearmament at all . This amounted to saying that U. S. citizens lately have been gazing at nothing but a huge trial balloon . Not even this , however , was the most astonishing thing in the Administration 's Rearmament fuss . <P> General Malin Craig , Chief of Staff of the U. S. Army , up to last week had not been consulted about the big new Rearmament plans . The law makes it his job to formulate military policy for his Commander-in-Chief . For weeks he has peeved in silence , loath to admit in public that he knows little more about the Administration 's ideas for remaking the Army than ordinary newspaper readers . Admiral William D. Leahy , Chief of Naval Operations , is in much the same fix , with the difference that the Navy already had a big expansion program under way when three ex-officio strategists began to fiddle with the Administration 's plans . <P> These militarists pro tem were none other than Janizaries Tommy Corcoran , Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Louis Arthur Johnson , who likes to ignore generals . Nor was aggressive Mr. Johnson loath to leave out Secretary of War Harry Hines Woodring , who has been making cause with the snubbed general against his nominal assistant . <P> What put Corcoran , Hopkins &; Co. into the armament business was a chance to hitch New Deal pump-priming to National Defense . In the democratic jitters after Munich they saw a glittering opportunity to butter up and stimulate heavy industry without surrendering to it on the issues of labor , utilities , regulation . The bright prospect to them was that businessmen who got Government millions in armament orders could hardly object to continued and even intensified regulation , especially if it were in the name of National Defense . Public health , housing , power , all could be tied to Rearmament-for-uplift , and Franklin Roosevelt would have a new touchstone for his general program .
