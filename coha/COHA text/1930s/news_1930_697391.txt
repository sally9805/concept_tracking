txt Probably the low price of wheat and the virtual break-down of the Government 's Farm Relief experiments are responsible for the rather hysterical manner in which Mr. HYDE , the Secretary of Agriculture , has approached the question of " the Soviet 's sales . " The first excited announcement , that a Russian syndicate had been " going short of wheat " at Chicago , seems to have given to many startled readers the idea that the real cause had been discovered for the fall in wheat from $1.38 per bushel last January to 79% cents last week . It was a conspiracy by the Russian Government . But when the controversy got down to particulars this invitingly picturesque idea was somewhat shaken . Secretary HYDE declared that the All-Russian Textile Syndicate had " gone short " some 7,500,000 bushels of wheat on four days of the present month , and that wheat prices had fallen 5 cents a bushel on those days . He was cautious enough to admit that those sales might not have been the " sole cause " for the break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. HYDE grew excited again over the fact that the Russian Government " elects to sell wheat abroad " at a time ' when it is rationing its own people and " shooting men for forging food cards . " Since , however , the Secretary is also convinced that the Russian sellers of wheat at Chicago " can never under any possibility make delivery , " one is tempted to ask what this has to do with the question . The whole discussion is incoherent . The business of the " Textile Syndicate " is to buy American cotton and textile machinery for the Russian spinning industry . If it has indulged in wheat speculation , that must apparently have been one of those " side ventures " in which Russian organizations of the sort notoriously engage . Possibly sales were made on the theory that increased shipments of wheat from Russia to Germany or England would force down European prices , and react on the Chicago market ; but the talk of Russian wheat exports has itself been overdone . The reference Ito " hedging sales " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " selling short as much wheat as he has bought for grinding into flour , the sale being made to protect him against loss in his milling operation if the price of wheat and flour should decline . The entire performance looks like a stupid business on the part of the Russian " syndicate " ; but at least our own Government might keep its head . This is not the first time the notion has been put out that the course of wheat prices is governed , not by production and consumption , but by the arbitrary whim of individuals . In the " Bryan year " 1896 , wheat fell nearly to 50 cents a bushel , an event on which the freesilver-coinage agitators laid great stress , as proving that wheat was bound to fall forever under the gold standard . Very inconveniently for these campaign orators , the price ran up to 94 cents before election week . The unimaginative Chicago market ascribed the change to failure of the harvest in India , but BRYAN 'S committeemen knew better It was the Money Power that wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delude the Western voter .
