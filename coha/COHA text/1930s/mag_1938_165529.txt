Only one Briton , Earl Baldwin of Bewdley , has $1,250,000 to administer at his discretion for the purpose of drawing the Mother Country and other parts of the British Commonwealth even more closely together . This huge sum was given by an anonymous British donor as a thank offering for Mr. Baldwin 's masterly success in keeping Mrs. Simpson off the throne of England . For some time , Lord Baldwin has been expected to make a tour of the British Dominions Beyond the Seas , to see about spending the $37,500 annual income from this Imperial Trust . But the Earl has been in no hurry . On the day he ceased to be Prime Minister , he discarded formal morning suit , heavy gold watch chain , and stiff wing collar of Statesmanship , and retired into natty brown and grey suits with colored shirts and soft collars to match . Last week a local horticultural show was staged on the grounds of the Baldwin estate , and neighbors gathered , wondering if the Earl in his address would at last announce his Empire tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . <P> I shall do a job I wanted to do last year but could not , " said Lord Baldwin , and all present braced themselves for the announcement . The Earl then capped his climax : " I am going to go through my papers for the last 18 years . Those papers are reposing in a tin box , and if there is anything in them which will hang anybody then I will destroy them . ... It will keep me quiet for three months . "
