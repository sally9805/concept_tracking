CLOSE SHOT IN RING SECTION OF ROPE NIGHT Al Schwimmer , a battle-scarred fighter , is catapulted against the ropes from a terrific left to the stomach . We do not see the other fighter , Johnnie Bradfield  --  just the precision of his gloves . The weary Schwimmer recovers only to meet a rataplan of rights and lefts to the jaw . We still only see his opponent 's gloves as Schwimmer staggers back against the ropes , that goofy look creeping over his face . The crowd , sensing the approaching kill , shrieks . &nbsp; AD LIB ( shouts ) Atta boy , Johnnie ! Finish him , Lefty ! Fight cockeye ! You can fight out of it !

This is the hand that did it ! What a left  --  it 's dynamite that left !

( he laughs a short ugly laugh ) Ai n't that right , Monty ? &nbsp; PHELAN ( not even long years have made him immune to these insults ) If you say so , it must be right , Inspector . &nbsp; JOHNNIEWell , let Doc know who the guy is and he 'll be taken care of .

I should have known  --  you 're a south-paw. ( he stops ) Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny the way you 've got of handling yourself in there  --  left-handed like that with your right stuck out . That 's the first thing I always notice about a man  --  his stance - more than his face . A lot of people look alike , but no two people ever stand just the same way .  --  11  --  &nbsp; ENNISThat 's a great theory you got there , Phelan . That the way you identified Barney Scofield ? Phelan wheels on Ennis as though the latter had punched him between the eyes . But Ennis knows he wo n't hit back because he 's afraid of losing his measley little job in the department . &nbsp; PHELAN ( subsiding ) Guess if you say so , Inspector , it must be right . The little cliche is his only protection . He turns back to strap on the watch . &nbsp; JOHNNIEFirst hole  --  &nbsp; PHELANYou bet  --  first hole  --  that 's some wrist you 've got there . &nbsp; JOHNNIEYeah . I guess I got plenty of wrist . &nbsp; ENNISBetter run along back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make trouble if you leave ' em too long . &nbsp; PHELANOkay . There is ten years of repressed hatred in his face as he salutes his superior and walks out . &nbsp; JOHNNIE ( grinning ) A new one you 're riding ? &nbsp; ENNISNew one ? Been with the department ever since I have  --  only he 's on morgue detail while I 'm Inspector - Somehow he got the idea that he was a great detective . He was making all kinds of pinches until one day he made the wrong one .  --  12  --  A reporter munching a hot dog turns around . &nbsp; REPORTERTalking about Phelan ? &nbsp; ENNISYeah . Remember him putting the finger on Barney Scofield ? &nbsp; REPORTERAnd finding out he was wrong  --  after they burned Barney in the chair . &nbsp; JOHNNIENo foolin ' . You mean he did that ? &nbsp; ENNIS ( nods ) Well , it sure cured him of pointing . Funny thing , if it had been me I 'd have quit the force  --  but not that guy . He sticks around doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that some day he 's going to come back , make the big pinch and show us all up . But I 'm taking no chances on another mistake . The only guys I 'll let him play around with are the ones that are already dead  --  The rubber turns Johnnie on his side . &nbsp; ENNISWell , so long , Johnnie  --  Let me know when you 're ready to go and I 'll get you a police escort . &nbsp; JOHNNIEOkay , Inspector  --  and thanks for everything  --  Ennis walks away as the rubber gives Johnnie a final slap on the rump . &nbsp; RUBBERThere you is , Mister Champ .

He 's canned . &nbsp; HENDRICKSAw , do n't get mad . I did n't mean anything . &nbsp; JOHNNIE ( relaxes ) Okay . But just because a guy does n't drink or fool around with women and respects his mother you do n't have to make a monkey out of him . &nbsp; FIRST REPORTERDo n't pay any attention to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir .  --  14  --  Johnnie satisfied , smiles , waves an exit . &nbsp; REPORTER ( continuing ) Am I right , boys ?
