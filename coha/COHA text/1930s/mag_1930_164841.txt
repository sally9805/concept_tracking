Last week a bald , ruddy-cheeked , jolly Briton of 69 arrived in Manhattan from England . His coming was the occasion for great activity among the pedagogs of Columbia 's Teachers College , for since the turn of the Century no name has been more famed in pedagogy than that of Michael Ernest Sadler . He had come to deliver this year 's Sachs Memorial Lectures at Teachers College . <P> Author of the " Sadler Reports " ( 1895-1903 ) when , as director of Special Inquiries and Reports in the Education Department of England and Wales , he disseminated sheafs of data on educational goings-on in Germany , England , France , Belgium , the U. S. , he became in later years President of the Calcutta University Commission ( 1917-19 ) . For this work a Gracious Sovereign was pleased to knight him . Sir Michael Sadler is now Master of University College . Oxford , where he likes to show students his collection of French and English paintings . <P> Amused and stimulated were Columbia 's pedagogs last week when their visitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Columbian idea of mass education and the pet theory of their colleague , Professor Thomas Henry Briggs , head of the department of Secondary Education . Professor Briggs vehemently believes that all schools should be state-supplied , " democratic , " that today 's private schools are unsatisfactory . Sir Michael prefaced his remarks by soothing any Columbian feathers that might become ruffled later . Said he : ' ' Teachers College is by far the greatest center for the study of educational method and philosophy in both hemispheres . . . its yearbooks the best telescope through which the student can now sweep into his vision the educational changes of the world . " <P> Then he began refuting the Briggsian precepts . Recommending an Aristotelian hierarchy of learning , said he : <P> " The new movement in education , which at present wears the appearance of being democratic , has gained volume and . . . irresistible force . But all government calls for an elite ; business calls for an elite ; sound administration rests upon an elite ; culture itself , though , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must be guarded by an elite . . . . <P> " What most concerns humanity in the long run is the illumination of genius not the mediocrity of the crowd . A thousand poetasters might well have been left to carry on their shoulders heavy burdens up the Italian hillsides rather than lose one Dante . Better that all the students in the mid-Victorian Mechanics ' Institutes should never have heard of science than lose a Darwin . If the modern movement in secondary education means the decapitation of the eminent in the interests of the average , it will stand condemned at the bar of future history . <P> ' ' Education must produce an elite . The elite must emerge from the whole range of human society . " <P> After his Columbia lectures Sir Michael headed for Washington to look at the Congressional Library , then to lecture at Swarthmore ( Pa. ; , then to the University of Pennsylvania ( Philadelphia ) , thence back to Manhattan and home , a fortnight 's flying visit .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
