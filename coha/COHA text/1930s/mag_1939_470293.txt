IN RECENT years we have heard much about the importance of the profit motive as a spur to human achievement . More than once I have listened to men , in Pullman cars and elsewhere , discussing the work of inventors as a good example of the fortunate relationship between desire for profit and scientific progress . Once , in a smoking compartment , I ventured to ask a man who had been explaining inventors : " Do n't people sometimes become curious about a problem and work to see what they can find out ? " The man replied : " Say , you do n't think they would work long just for their health , do you ? Take the Wright brothers . How long would they have kept on pouring money into their experiments and risking their lives trying to fly if they had n't expected to get rich at it ? It 's the chance for profit that keeps things going . " Most of the other passengers in the compartment nodded approval . Not long after that I was in Dayton , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think the expectation of making money is the main incentive to inventors ? " He reflected for a moment before replying : " I hardly think so . I doubt if Alexander Graham Bell expected to make much out of the telephone . It seems unlikely that Edison started out with the idea of making money . Certainly Steinmetz had little interest in financial reward . All he asked of life was the opportunity to spend as much time as possible in the laboratory working at problems that interested him . " " And the Wright brothers ? " Orville Wright chuckled . " If we had been interested in invention with the idea of profit , " he said , " we most assuredly would have tried something in which the chances for success were brighter . You see , we did not expect in the beginning to go beyond gliding . Even later we did n't suppose the aeroplane could ever be practical outside the realm of sport . It was the sport of the thing that appealed to Will and me . The question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money enough to keep on entertaining ourselves with it . It was something to spend money an , just as a man spends for golf , if that interests him , with no idea of making it pay . " " You did n't foresee commercial planes or transcontinental and trans-Atlantic flights ? " ? " No ; and in our wildest dreams , even after we had flown , we never imagined it would ever be possible to fly or make landings at night . " " Still , " 1 suggested , " it seems strange that you did n't have more of a profit motive , inasmuch as you had been in business as a means of making a living and obliged to make the business pay . Did n't you go into the printing business as a youngster to make money ? " The inventor smilingly shook his head : " I got interested in printing , " he said , " after my curiosity had been aroused by some woodcuts I saw in the Century magazine , and I tried to make some tools for carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring of an old pocket-knife . Gradually I became more and more interested in printing ? but making it pay its way came as an afterthought . " Yes , the truth is that , from earliest years , Orville Wright , as well as his brother Wilbur , have always been motivated by what Thorstein Veblen called the " instinct of workmanship . " Their father , the Rev. Dr. Milton Wright , used to encourage them in this and never chided them for spending on their hobbies what little money they might have . But he did urge them to try to earn enough to meet the costs of whatever projects they were carrying on . " All the money anyone needs , " he used to say , " is just enough to prevent one from being a burden on others . " Hence the Wright brothers tried to earn their own spending money . But they never became interested in a hobby because it might be profitable . Most of Orville Wright 's childhood recollections have to do with mechanical devices of one kind or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he attained the age of five , because he received for a birthday gift a gyroscopic top that would spin while resting on the edge of a knife-blade or on a piece of string held taut . Shortly after that fifth birthday began an association which had an influence on his life for a number of years . His mother started him to kindergarten . The school was within a short walking distance of the Wright home and Orville set out after breakfast each morning with just enough time to reach the classroom without loitering on the way . His mother bade him return home promptly after the class was dismissed and he always arrived punctually at the time expected . When asked how he was getting along , lie cheerfully said all was going well , but did not offer any details . At the end of a monthhis mother went to visit the kindergarten to learn just how little Orvie was doing . " I hope the child has been behaving himself , " said the mother to the teacher . The teacher stared at her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , since the first few days I have n't seen him . I supposed you had decided to keep him at home . " Naturally there was an investigation . It turned out that Orville had almost immediately lost interest in the kindergarten and had regularly gone instead to a house two doors from his own where lived a playmate , Edwin Henry Sines . With an eye on the clock to adjust himself to the kindergarten hours , he had stayed there and played with young Sines until about a minute before he was due at home . Orville 's father and mother were not too severe when this little irregularity was discovered because the boys had not been engaged in any mischief . On the contrary , they had been doing things that might properly be called " constructive . " They invented new games and made little devices of wood with such crude carpenter tools as they could find about the house . One thing that fascinated them was an old sewing-machine . They " oiled " it by dropping water from a feather into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main wheel to operate other " machinery " consisting largely of spools . The boys might have invented something important ? to them at least ? but their intimate association was interrupted after a short time because Orville 's father , a bishop of the United Brethren church , was shifted to Cedar Rapids , Iowa . Later the Wright family moved from Cedar Rapids to Richmond , Indiana . While in Richmond , Orville rigged up a small wood-lathe . Encouraged by his brother Wilbur , four years older , who offered to help him , he then built a much bigger lathe , seven or eight feet long . Neighbor boys seemed only too glad to come and work the foot-treadle that provided the motive power , and the lathe was considered a success . But Wilbur thought it needed improving . He had noticed that bicycles were being equipped for the first time with ball-bearings to give easy-running quality and he decided that the lathe should have ball-bearings . Orville and he looked about the barn for material that could be adapted and took some metal rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of two rings tightly held side by side would be a track for several small marbles , and within the circle of marbles would rest the shaft of the lathe . What could be simpler ? Several boys came as aides and spectators to the upper floor of the barn where the lathe was set up , and awaited eagerly the final tinkering before the ball-bearing improvement could be demonstrated . When the lathe got to going there was a terrible noise , and after a time it seemed as if the whole barn was beginning to sway and shake . It was evident that the marbles in the bearing had not been strong enough to stand the strain and had broken to bits , which partly accounted for the noise . But why should the barn itself be so agitated ? Orville went downstairs to find out if there could be any other cause . When he reached the outside he saw his sister held against the side of the barn by an invisible force , unable to move . A small cyclone was taking place ! All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lathe and its new ball-bearings to take notice of such minor phenomena as weather . II After an absence of seven years the Wrights returned to Dayton , and Orville resumed his friendship with young Sines . It was along about this time too that he was interested , as already mentioned , in making crude woodcuts ? which he learned how to do from reading an article in Harper 's Young People . He printed his first woodcuts on a press his father had for copying letters . To-day the old-fashioned letter-press is seldom seen . It consisted of two horizontal metal plates that could be forced close together by turning a little wheel at the top of a threaded rod . One 's letter was moistened and placed next to a thin tissue sheet in a record book which went between the plates of the press . Under pressure , a copy of the letter was transferred to the tissue . Such a press was a handy device for a boy to play with . But Orville Wright soon wished for a press on which he could set type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ed Sines had got hold of a small press , capable of printing only one line at a time , and they knew a boy whose father , employed in a Dayton newspaper office , was able to obtain for them a lot of pied type that had been thrown into the hell-box . Then they got a slightly larger press from a boy who was willing to trade it for a complete file , covering more than a year , of a magazine called Golden Days . This magazine contained serial stories so exciting that many parents did not approve of it , and back numbers had a way of disappearing ; hence it was not surprising that a file of it could be swapped for an article of seemingly greater value . The boys found it was more fun if they printed something of practical use , such as business cards . Their first job of that kind read : EDWIN HENRY SINES , Lawns Mowed . That gave them the idea of going into the job-printing business , and they formed the partnership of Sines &; Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of whom paid them as much as fifteen cents . Once they received from a neighbor an order that , if well executed , would pay them nearly a dollar , and they began to think of still bigger jobs . But they were somewhat handicapped by the fact that their type did not include quite all the letters of the alphabet ; and their press was too small . Orville 's elder brothers , Lorin and Reuchlin , owned a boat they no longer used , and they heard of a boy who would trade a good-sized printing-press for the boat . Their father suggested that if they would make the trade and donate the press to Orville , he would buy for Orville twenty-five dollars ' worth of brevier type . Thus equipped , Sines &; Wright could handle bigger jobs and they got occasional orders from neighborhood stores . All went smoothly until one day they got an order from a man who wished to pay for his printing not in money but in popcorn . He had a lot of popcorn on the cob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printing would have cost . They accepted the popcorn ? which , it turned out , was indeed worth two dollars ? and Orville Wright saw greater opportunities opening before them . With a liquid capital of two dollars they could buy more type , do a greater variety of printing , and hence have more fun . But Ed Sines thought there was such a thing as over-extension of plant . Why not simply divide their popcorn and eat it ? The two boys were so far apart in their convictions that there was only one thing to do ? one must buy out the other and they would dissolve the partnership . Inasmuch as Orville Wright already owned the press they were using and most of the type , it was logical that he should be the buyer , and by paying his share of the popcorn he was able to take over his partner 's interest without much cash outlay . Thenceforth when they worked together , as from time to time they continued to do , Ed Sines was no longer coproprietor but a salaried employe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much fun to be confined to job work , and he was determined to get out a little neighborhood paper . But that would require a bigger press . To buy it was out of the question . He knew of only one way to get such a press and that was to make it himself . This he proceeded to do . In the back yard was a pile of fire-wood , cut in four-foot lengths , and from these he made the framework and some of the working parts of a press with a flat bed large enough to print a five-column paper . From nearby junk yards he got various cogs and odds and ends of iron or steel that could be used . A difficult problem was to find a means of forcing the type against the printing surface , always with the same pressure , just enough and not too much . Orville searched the Wright barn and tool-shed for something that could be used , but without success until his eye happened to alight on the old family buggy , no longer in use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , when raised , by steel bars hinged in the middle . They were designed to force the top just so far and no farther . Exactly what he needed ! Wilbur Wright , observing his sixteenyear-old brother at a tough job , once again offered his aid . Some of the suggestions he made for moving parts of that press were peculiar in that they seemed to violate all mechanical rules and could not possibly be expected to work . Yet they did . Some months later a well-dressed stranger entered the little rented shop where Orville was feeding paper into the press , and asked if he might look at that " homemade printing outfit . " He had seen an item about it that a Dayton correspondent had written for out-of-town newspapers . What at once astonished Orville and two or three boys in the shop was that the visitor , with complete disregard of his good clothes , lay right down flat on his back on the floor to watch the press in operation . After he had observed it for several minutes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It works all right , but I still do n't understand why it works . " Before leaving he laid his card on a table . He was the foreman of the mechanical department of a newspaper in Denver . Soon after he had made his new press , Orville Wright printed a little five-column newspaper which he called the West Side News . All copies of a small edition were distributed free . It seemed to arouse enough interest to justify another issue a week later . For this second issue Ed Sines hustled about and obtained a number of advertising orders , and other boys went after paid subscriptions on commission . That issue more than paid its way and the weekly West Side News became a regular enterprise . Orville Wright , though having the title of editor , was not interested in writing . ( To this day he dislikes writing even brief letters , so much so that his close friends consider it an event to receive a note from him . ) Various other lads offered their services in preparing news items and articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space by writing humorous essays . He had been hit in the face with a hockey-club while skating and was for a few months confined to the house , physically inactive . The common impression is that the Wright brothers were in the publishing business together , but Wilbur 's part did not go beyond the assistance he had given in building the press and his literary contributions . Another contributor was a young Negro lad , still in high school , Paul Laurence Dunbar , whose poetry later made him famous . Considering that Orville Wright was only seventeen when the paper was launched , the business was a success . It did not bring the proprietor a fortune , nor was that the purpose of it , but it gave him spending money he needed ? and he used part of that for mechanical experiments in other directions . During this period Orville made a crude calculating machine ? some time before any such device was on the market , but he did n't bother to have it patented ? and he also worked on an improvement over any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegraph line between their homes and for years afterward Wilbur Wright always referred to it as the " first wireless telegraph , " because the boys used to shout the messages back and forth to confirm those that they clicked out on the instruments . At the end of eighteen months of pubIishing ? and having now completed his course in high school ? Orville decided to convert the West Side News into a daily , called The Evening Item . The daily continued for three months and , though not profitable , at least did not show any financial loss . But it might have become a burden , for at that time the perfecting-press was coming into use and Dayton newspapers were issuing big , thick editions that proved to be increasingly keen competition for a neighborhood sheet . Hence the paper was suspended . But the job-printing business went along for another year or two . While still operating his printing-shop , Orville Wright got interested in another form of sport ? bicycling . His first bicycle was an old high-wheel for which he paid three dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use in various experiments he was constantly carrying on ; so he borrowed the three dollars from Wilbur . ) A new type of bicycle with wheels about the same size , and called a " safety , " was beginning to be popular and , before long , Orville abandoned his high-wheel in favor of a " safety , " with pneumatic tires . Wilbur got one at about the same time . Orville promptly became interested in track-racing . His brother , though a great athlete ? a wonderful fancy skater and the best performer in Dayton on a horizontal bar ? never went in for racing ; but Orville began to enter his name in various track events and to meet the famous racers of the day ? Arthur A. Zimmerman , the New Jersey wonder boy who was in a class by himself ; Fred J. Titus , John S. Johnson , and , of course , another Dayton racer , Earl S. Kiser . Whether racing or merely taking long rides , there was need for trying to improve the efficiency of the machine itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying new gear ratios , different types of bearings , various kinds and weights of tires . Before long they knew more about bicycles than anyone in Dayton . Bicycle repair-shops were almost nonexistent . About the only place to go for repairs was to a blacksmith or machine-shop where the workmen had little specialized knowledge of bicycles , or interest in them , and in a short time the brothers were actually compelled to open a little repair-shop ? a predecessor of the shop now on exhibition at Henry Ford 's Greenfield village museum at Dearborn , Michigan . Thus once again what had been taken up as a hobby or sport became a business . ( Incidentally , the homemade press on which Orville had printed his newspaper was stored for a long time in the basement of their first bicycle repair-shop and when they moved to other quarters they did not take it along . It did not seem to them worth moving . Later when they went to look for it , it was gone . Valuable as it would be to-day , as a relic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Along with their repair business the Wrights took an agency for one or two makes of bicycles . From time to time they installed what seemed to them improvements on the new " wheels " they handled and a little later the logic of events forced them to buy parts and assemble a few bicycles containing all the Wright features . These sold readily and there was a sharp demand for more . Before they were through with the business , they had put out under their own brand nearly one thousand bicycles ? first the Van Cleve , and then the Wright Special . A number of those old bikes are still in running order . Any owner of a Van Cleve or a Wright Special to-day , regardless of its state of repair , can probably get more for it than it cost when new . Several specimens were bought for the Ford museum at more than their original cost , but now the asking price has soared much higher than Mr. Ford considers reasonable . A number of the bicycles have been offered in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not a Ford but a Lincoln ! Throughout the time they were repairing , selling and building bicycles , the Wrights continued to make various experiments , just for the hell of it . They made what was doubtless the first pair of " balloon " tires ever installed on a vehicle . It was necessary to build a special " front fork " and widen the frame at the rear to make room for the over-sized pneumatics . The canvas covering on these experimental tires was not too durable and by no means puncture-proof , but the Wrights foresaw that sooner or later bigger and more resilient tires would come into use . Occasionally the brothers took in trade an old high-wheel . They had two of these , about the same size , that they could n't sell for much , and the only way to get much benefit from them was to use them in a new way for sport . Why not , they asked themselves , convert them into a tandem ? No one had ever heard of two high-wheels operated as a unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would also be exciting . The Wrights soon discovered that the steel rod connecting the two wheels would need a swivel attachment or else it would promptly twist and break . Moreover they found that the man on the rear seat had to learn bicycle riding all over . On turning a corner he had to use a special technic that no bicyclist had ever needed before ? a little like the man steering the rear of a long fire-truck . It looked fairly easy and several of their friends tried the rear seat , but only one boy , besides the Wrights , ever succeeded in staying mounted . Indeed , that tandem was perilous enough unless one of the Wrights was also on the less hazardous front seat . III A few mishaps with the tandem may or may not have set the Wrights to thinking they should play with something less dangerous . At any rate , they now took up another project that appealed to them for its sporting possibilities ? the building of a gliding-machine . This had been in their minds for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and Wilbur eleven , their father had brought home a toy flyingdeleted material every conceivable angle . The books told them that no more power was needed to support a square plane in the air than an oblong plane ; but the Wrights discovered that the longer the plane surface in proportion to its width , the more easily could it be supported . ( Theoretically it would be desirable to-day to have airplane wings many times as long as their width , but the difficulty would be to give enough strength to them without adding too much weight . Hence most wings on airplanes to-day are only about six times as long as wide . ) Their air-tunnel experiments proved to the Wrights ' satisfaction also that a curved surface was better for their purpose than a flat surface . Moreover , they ascertained just how much of a curve was needed . After their experiments had convinced the Wrights that they must disregard published figures relating to air currents against airplane surfaces , both they and Chanute agreed that they must compile tables of their own . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Wrights would ever have flown ? and they would not have conducted the experiments except for the chance of Wilbur having been asked by Chanute to address that engineering society in Chicago . It was their efforts to verify by experiment the statements Wilbur had made that turned the tide . Thus the Chicago speech was an epochal point in the history of flying . However , the Wrights stilt might not have flown if Chanute had not once again , a few months later , exerted chance influence . Their experiments naturally took much time and , for their modest means , not a little money . Since there was no expectation of ever getting the money back , they began to wonder if they were n't permitting a hobby to become too much of a luxury . Wilbur was inclined to drop their researches . Orville thought they should continue a little longer , but , if Wilbur had quit , Orville would hardly have gone ahead alone . Just at that time a letter came from Chanute . He urged themnot to cease their experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of aeronautics far beyond that possessed by anyone else in the world . To go on was almost a duty . That letter was the straw that weighted their decision in favor of going ahead . Without it , flying might have been postponed many years . Having decided to continue their experiments , the Wrights had a double reason for making sure of their figures . With little money to spend on a hobby , it was much cheaper to work on paper than with actual mechanical material . So careful were they about verifying their data that when they built anything they were reasonably certain it was scientifically correct . The result of this insistence on doing everything possible on paper was that , up to the day when they actually flew , their total outlay of money was a trifle less than two thousand dollars . Even at the present time , it is doubtful if the full value and difficulties of the Wrights ' scientific researches are appreciated . The world knows they were the first to build a machine capable of sustained flight and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grueling mathematical work they had to do on paper before flight was possible . After establishing certain facts about air pressure on airplane surfaces , the brothers turned their attention to propellers . They had not at first given much concern to propellers because they assumed that all necessary data would be easily obtainable from companies manufacturing motor boats . Surely such companies would have the facts with all possible accuracy and the angle of a propeller most suitable for speed or greatest efficiency in water would also be best in the air . But to their surprise they discovered that the boat-building companies , the very ones that might be expected to have the most information about propellers , knew almost nothing about them ? or , at any rate , their knowledge was shockingly inexact . The boat-builders had simply tried propellers of different shapes until they got something that would answer a given purpose , but they could n't design a propeller on paper and tell what its performance would be on a certain type of boat . Hence it became necessary for the Wrights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces . While working on this phase of their problem they made it a practice to change sides from time to time on a puzzling question . During a discussion Wilbur would appear to favor one idea and Orville would pick flaws in the argument . A day later Orville might shift to a point of view exactly opposite to the one he had previously defended and Wilbur would offer every possible objection . Iv ' The common impression is that flying would not have been possible much sooner than it was for the reason that no suitable internal combustion engine was to be had . But the motor was the least of the Wrights ' worries . For several years before their first flight there were motors on the market that might have met their needs . Naturally , they had to give much thought to how the motor should he mounted on the plane , but they built their own partly because they could n't spare the money to buy one . The fact is , says Orville Wright to-day , once the plane itself was properly constructed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power provided by a steam engine . Naturally , a glider had to precede a power-driven plane . When the Wrights tested their gliding-machine at Kitty Hawk , North Carolina , in 1902 , and found their figures dependable , they knew that a flying-machine driven by its own power was a passibility . Indeed , it was more than that . Their figures now showed it to be well nigh a certainty ! When they set out for Kitty Hawk with their motor-driven plane the following year , they were so certain of success that they gat scant thrill from having the plane conic up to expectations and make the first sustained flight the world had ever known . They knew they were going to fly . " The biggest thrill , I think , " Orville Wright once told me , " was lying in bed thinking how interesting it finally would be . " On the December day when they first attempted motor-driven flight , the brothers tossed a coin to determine which of them should be the first man ever to fly . Wilbur won the toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not get off the ground quite right . He climbed a few feet and came down about 100 feet away after being up just two and one-half seconds . This did n't count as a flight . Three days later , on the now historic December 17th , Orville took his turn . The machine started so slowly that Wilbur could run alongside of it for the first few yards . That flight lasted twelve seconds . They made three more flights that day , despite icy winds . The last , by Wilbur , lasted fifty-nine seconds and covered 852 feet . Then the wind upset and damaged the plane . But the dream of centuries had been accomplished . The impression persists that the Wrights were secretive about their preparations at Kitty Hawk that day . But the truth is that , being sure of what they were about to accomplish , they desired witnesses and invited various natives of the locality to be on hand . Most of those invited just laughed and went on about their usual tasks . Only about half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come to Kitty Hawk to see about buying some salvage from a wreck off the coast . He was patronizing toward the Wrights . " What have you got there ? a flying-machine ? " he asked , in a tone as if talking to someone not quite bright . " Yes , " one of the brothers admitted . " I think it 'll go , " said the visitor , with a wink at bystanders ; " that is , it 'll go if the conditions are right ? if we get a hundred-mile-an-hour gale . ' As soon as possible after their successful trials the brothers went to a government wcathcr bureau station not far away , near a little place called KM . Devil , and at 5:25 p.m. sent a telegram to their father in Dayton . It read as follows : Success four flights Thursday morning all against twenty-one mile wind started from level with engine power alone average speed through air thirty-one miles longest 59 seconds inform press home Christmas . Orville Wright . The operator at the weather station sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Dayton the figure 59 had become 57 and Orville 's name was spelled " Orevelle . " The Rev. Dr. Wright noticed the misspelling of Orville 's name but it seems doubtful if he then appreciated the full significance of the message . As requested , he sent word about the flight to the Dayton newspapers . His son Lorin carried the telegram first to the office of the Dayton Journal where one of the editors was also local representative of the Associated Press . Was the AP man overwhelmed by the importance of the " scoop " ? No . He suppressed a yawn of boredom as he commented : " Fifty-seven seconds , hey ? If it had been fifty-seven minutes then it might have been a news item . " Inasmuch as that AP man knew the event was not important enough to be a " story " for the papers , nothing whatsoever appeared about it in the Dayton Journal the next morning . Not long ago I took the trouble to find a copy of the Journal for December 18 , 1903 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did consider important for that issue . First-page news that day included items about : a routine weekly meeting of the local united trades and labor council ; a colored man named Charles Brown who admitted pocketbook thefts ; a janitor at the Dayton post-office suspected of mail thefts ; the pardoning of a robber from Joliet prison , in Illinois . On the page opposite the editorial page , the biggest , blackest headline was as follows : Stores Are Filled with Christmas Shoppers . The two afternoon papers on that December 18th did , however , print accounts of the receipt of that telegram by the Reverend Dr. Wright . But they did not indicate that the conquering of the air by man was anything to grow excited about . Six or seven other newspapers in the country , including the Cincinnati Enquirer , printed a fantastic story sent out by a reporter at Norfolk , Virginia , who had heard rumors and telephoned to the nearest weather station ? the same station where Orville Wright had sent his telegram . The operator there told him : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to give you any details , but I do know that there was a successful flight . " With no information beyond that , the reporter , rarely gifted , sat down and banged out a column and a half , crammed with details . He told of how after the first flight by Wilbur , Orville went running up and down the field excitedly waving his hands and screaming " Eureka ! " At the time of a later flight at Kitty Hawk , that reporter met Orville Wright and asked him how he liked the account . " A most amazing piece of work , " Orville good-naturedly replied . " Everything in it was wrong with one exception . There had been a flight . " Long after that first flight Dayton newspapermen wondered why they were receiving dispatches from Paris , in the press services , about the achievement of the Wright brothers . Had n't Santos Dumont navigated by air across the English Channel long before the Wrights ever flew ? Why then all the shouting ? Lacking scientific knowledge , they failed to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gas-bag equipped with a propeller . Several months after the Wrights had flown , an American member of the Aero Club of France cabled to a friend in Mansfield , Ohio , requesting him to go to Dayton " and investigate the claims of the Wright brothers . " Though living in the same State and less than one hundred and fifty miles from Dayton , the Mansfield man had never heard of the flights and thought the reference to " claims " must be about some kind of financial claims against his friend in France . The failure of most newspapers to say much about the first flights was often used as an argument to prove there could n't he any truth in the stories that men had actually made a successful flying-machine . " You could n't keep a thing like that secret . Some reporter surely would have heard about it ! " Even when the Wrights made their first circular flights at Dayton , in 1904 , it was said that a reporter for a New York paper would have been discharged for sending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm his statements . Having flown , the Wrights still did not know they had done anything from which they would gain a fortune . They accepted what unexpectedly fell into their laps , but to this day Orville Wright is not sure it 's quite decent to live on income from interest-bearing paper . Still of simple tastes , less interested in benefiting from what he finds than in the fun of finding it , he continues to be an inventor just to satisfy his intellectual curiosity and his " instinct of workmanship . " All over his home are little devices that he has made to satisfy a need and that he has never bothered to have patented . His phonograph is equipped with a crude but simple mechanism for automatically changing the records , and he made this long before any such contrivance was on the market . " To have had it patented would have taken time it was more interesting to devote to something else . " At his summer camp in Georgian Bay nearly everything about the place is " some crazy contrivance " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that open by peculiar mechanism , and even movable roofs . When the Wrights were at Kitty Hawk it was not possible to have fresh supplies of foodstuffs brought to their isolated shack . If the brothers wanted fresh bread or biscuits they had to bake their own . Orville promptly learned to make biscuits and , in fact , he became a good all-round cook . He invented a toaster that might have been the forerunner of the modern electric toaster . Now and then he likes to go into the kitchen and prepare a meal with his own hands . His days , when he is in Dayton , are spent at his laboratory where he devotes himself to whatever line of research happens to strike his fancy . Not so long ago he designed for his brother Lorin who , with his sons , is in the toy business , a line of mechanical toys that are amazing for their simplicity as well as for their ingenuity . One of these is an airplane that after a short flight descends slowly with a parachute attachment . Another is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman trapeze artist , from a cannon . " She " turns a double somersault and then catches " her " hands on a wire two or three feet away . So accurately is the propelling mechanism contrived that the doll never fails to connect with the wire . Besides inventing the toys , Orville Wright also designed a special machine for making them economically . Of course , this inventor continues to be a student . Some years ago he learned French and German , not with any intention of speaking the languages , but to read a greater variety of scientific journals and books . When reading at home he usually sits in a certain chair from which he has sawed off part of the rear legs to give it a more comfortable tilt than he could find in any chair ready made . He knows exactly what reading position means the least strain on the eyes . His horn-rimmed reading-glasses , by the way , are of his own special design with a frame requiring a loop over only one ear . Not all his reading is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . I once said to him : " Even though what you accomplished was without the idea of making money , the fact remains that the Wright brothers will always be favorite examples of how American lads , with no special advantages , can forge ahead and become famous . " " But , " said Orville Wright , seriously , " that is n't true , because we did have special advantages . " " What special advantages ? " " Simply that we were lucky enough to grow up in a home environment where there was always much encouragement to children to pursue intellectual interests . We were early taught to cultivate the encyclopedia habit ; to look up facts about whatever aroused our curiosity . In a different kind of environment I imagine our curiosity might have been nipped long before it could have borne fruit . " Orville Wright flying a glider at Kill Devil Hill , North Carolina .

Mr. Davis reminds them that the problem is n't likely to look quite so simple after the new physician starts paying his calls . They 'd better start outfiting him now , remembering that he will need not only medicines but the ability to persuade the patient to swallow them . The Republicans have less than a year to study their pharmacopeia , and it wo n't do them or the patient any good to let the study languish . Mr. Davis is such an old hand at writing for us that our readers must be tired of identifying him as an ex-newspaper man ( once of the New York Times ) who now free-lances in New York , writing fiction and an occasional HARPER commentary on the state of the nation ( and also , for variety , disquisitions upon cats , Key West , and " On Not Being Dead , As Reported " ) .

He has written a Civil War novel , The Band Plays Dixie , two books on New York , and This Country of Yours , a traveler 's account of the U. S. A. during the depression .
