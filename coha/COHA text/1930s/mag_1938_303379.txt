Two years ago , when Baritone Lawrence Tibbett and 114 other highly paid opera stars and concert artists formed the American Guild of Musical Artists and called it a labor union , humbler musicians had to laugh . But a year later , Baritone Tibbett 's dress-collar union acquired an A. F. of L. charter and set about organizing opera from top to bottom , from $1s-a-week spear-carriers to prima donnas . Soon A. G. M. A. had negotiated agreements with Los Angeles ' Hollywood Bowl , the itinerant San Carlo Opera , the New York Hippodrome Opera , and most of the smaller U. S. opera companies . Last week , A. G. M. A. bagged a real prize : an agreement recognizing the union as sole bargaining agent for the artists at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . This killing left only two important U. S. opera companies for A. G. M. A. to shoot at : the Chicago City , and San Francisco .
