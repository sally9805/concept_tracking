Like love-passion and hate-passion , peace-passion and war-passion are first cousins . Not accidental was it that Socialists who for years claimed almost a patent on peace propaganda were last week the subject of investigation when the Department of Justice began to check up in San Francisco and Manhattan on the enrollment of volunteers to fight with the Loyalists in Spain . Not accidental is it that bills for " taking the profits out of war , * backed by many peace lovers in Congress , also provide for mobilizing practically all the resources of the U. S. for use in war. - Not accidental is it that members of the most peace-passionate Congress in U. S. history appear already at bellicose odds over amendments to the Neutrality Act . <P> But accidents were not lacking last week when the first skirmish of the neutrality war of 1937 was fought . Arrayed on one side was 1 ) Robert Cuse , naturalized Latvian of Jersey City who had forced the State Department , legally but against its will , to grant him a license to export $2,777,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , Jan. n ) ; 2 ) Captain Jos Santa Mara of the Spanish freighter Mar Cantabrico which lay at a Brooklyn pier loading Mr. Cuse 's war goods ; 3 ) Richard L. Dineley who , on the day Congress convened , obtained similar licenses to export $4,500,000 of similar second-hand war goods to Spain via Mexico : 4 ) Felix Gordon de Ordaz , Spanish Ambassador to Mexico , who was flying to Washington to sign the final papers so that 15 of Mr. Dineley 's planes could hastily hop across the border to Mexico . <P> On the other side were the peace-passionate President , Congress and State Department of the U. S. , all eager to make these acts crimes faster than they could be performed . Congress got a hump on . The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House was organized at least three days faster than usual . Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drafted an eloquent joint resolution with many whereases describing the brutality of the Spanish conflict , the danger of its dragging the U. S. into war . etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> U. S. Army officers climbed into the hold of the Mar Cantabrico , found 32 field kitchens which the Army had sold as junk , sternly forbade the ship to sail until the stenciled " U. S. Army " was painted out on the kitchens . Customs agents forced a big crate of shoes to be torn open because it weighed 400 lb. and they thought shoes should not weigh so much . <P> Twenty-four hours after Congress met , the peace-lovers were ready . Senators Pittman , Nye and Vandenberg had their say but the wrangle which might well have taken place was postponed in deference to haste . Only major Senate action was to strip the resolution of its eloquent whereases to clauses forbidding shipment of arms to civil-warring Spain , provide a $10,000 fine and five years in prison as maximum penalty for disobedience . It was passed , 81-to-0 . <P> The Mar Cantabrico was also getting into action . With eight crated airplanes on her decks , the last few not even bolted down , she had cast off and was on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
