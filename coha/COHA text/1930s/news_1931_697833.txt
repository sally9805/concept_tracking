txt Copper statistics for April show that refined stocks in North and South America increased 27.432,000 pounds last month , while stocks of copper in Havre increased 4,506.000 pounds and copper of all kinds in Great Britain increased 5,476,000 pounds . This makes a total increase of 37,414,000 pounds in the stocks here and in Europe . The one encouraging feature of the situation is that the increase in refined stocks in North and South America was offset by a decrease of 4.935 tons in blister copper in stock and process , reducing it to 193,876 short tons , the lowest figure in many years . The disconcerting feature was the sharp decline in domestic shipments , and the continued decline in foreign shipments . Foreign shipments so far this year . while they have been larger than for the first four months of 1930 , totaling 154,027 short tons , compared with 119.674 in corresponding period of 1930 , have shown a steady decline each month thus year . Furthermore , in making the comparison with 1930 it should be remembered that price until middle of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the four months were part of a period when foreign consumers were buying as little as possible , feeling certain that a break in price was merely a question of time . Domestic shipments declined more than 40. - 000.000 pounds in April compared with March . and fell to 54.567 tons compared with monthly average of 62,524 tons for the first four months of this year . Monthly average for first four months of 1930 was 63,868 tons . Finished Products Shipments Up This sudden falling off of domestic shipments probably is due to the nature of the buying during the last six months and does not represent any sudden drop in actual consumption of copper . American Brass Co. ' s shipments of finished and semi-finished products in April were the largest for any month since July and the April shipments of Anaconda Wire &; Cable Co. , which are mainly wire products , were larger than for the average of the first three months of this year . Explanation of the sudden drop in April sh.Innents of refined copper to domestic consumers seems to be that domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon by producers , bought heavily for first quarter . 1931 , shipment , spurred on by advance of 21 , , cents a pound . or 26% , in price In three days . Stock market optimism caused fair buying in the earlier part of 1931. but consumption of copper did not improve ' as much are expected , with the result that fabricating comp ... flies found themselves stocked ahead for several months . Consequently when they were induced by falling prices to come into the market . they bought , not for April . but for May . June and July shipment . April , therefore , was a month for which little copper had been contracted , and so refined stocks in producers ' hands showed a sudden increase . Consumers abroad are not well supplied with copper , but fabricators here are bought well ahead Stocks of copper above ground as result of the April increase are back almost to the high of last November , being 367,921 short tons May 1 compared with 367,175 January 1 and 369,832 tons December 1 , 1930 . Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copper industry might find it necessary to curtail output further during the coming months . The larger producers are , in the main , operating at such low rates , around 40% of capacity , that they can not decrease output much further without absolutely shutting down the mines in certain districts , with resulting great hardship to the workers . The curtailment , therefore , would seem to be up to those of the producers throughout the world who have not reduced to the rate at which most of the larger producers of North and South America are operating . With the possibility that on any advance in price , fabricators and consumers might decide not to buy , it would seem that the copper industry would be doing well if it were able to pass through the next three months without establishing a new record low price for copper . Present price of 9 cents equals the low established in 1894 . Conditions , however , are so abnormal here and abroad , and statistics are so difficult to interpret in such abnormal times as the present that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , should the producers of copper learn from their bitter experiences of the last year and more how to cooperate efficiently . price of copper might advance materially from present level without any improvement in copper consumption . There is also a move for a tariff on copper that is gaining way and that might help increase price for domestic producers of copper . Effect of Price on Consumption The one thing that the producers appear to have learned from the experiences of the last year or so is that just as much copper is consumed at 13 cents as at 9 cents , and that industrial conditions as a. whole , and not price of copper , determine the rate at which copper goes into consumption . With that fact finding wider appreciation among the different groups of producers , it would not be surprising to see definite steps taken in the next few months toward stabilizing copper prices . Such a move would be welcomed by fabricators of copper and brass products here and abroad , and not improbably also by most large users of copper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if copper consumption is to be increased in other lines than electrical , there must be sufficient stability in copper prices so that those selling directly to the ultimate consumer can afford to carry adequate stocks of copper and brass products throughout the smaller cities here and abroad . Arizona Copper Tariff Meeting Sprrrni to Trrn Srunr.r Joni/NAT . PHOENTX  --  An adequate tariff on foreign copper ores imported into the United States is necessary to insure the domestic market to American produced copper and revive copper production in the copper producing states , in the opinion of Governor George P. Hunt , of Arizona , who called a conference of the state 's loading business , agricultural , industrial , professional and mining men to consider a course of action . Pointing out that Arizona is the leading copper state , the Governor described the unfortunate condition of mining towns , in which the inhabitants have no means of relief , due to the alarming decrease in production of copper ores . Unrestrained and unrestricted importation of foreign ores into the United States in competition with domestic production was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged those who attended the conference at his invitation to give constructive thought to the problem and suggest a course of action that will lead to the revival of the state 's copper mining industry .
