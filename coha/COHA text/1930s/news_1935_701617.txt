txt When the income tax return figures were published a year ago they revealed some paradoxical results . Incomes in the lower brackets had declined in 1933 as compared with 1932 , while those in , the higher brackets rose . There was a fall in the total income of those reporting incomes of less than $5,000 and , in fact , of all classes reporting incomes of less than $25,000 . There was also a decline in their number . There was not only a gain , on the other hand , in both the number and the total amount of incomes above $25,000 , but this gain was progressively greater , proportionately , in the higher brackets , and was most pronounced in the case of those with incomes over $1,000,000 . The number of these rose from twenty to forty-six , and the aggregate income they reported from $35,000,000 to $82,000,000 . Radical commentators lost no time in drawing the moral that under the first year of the New Deal the income of the " little fellows " had been lowered while that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that even the " little fellows " who pay income taxes presumably form part of the richest 10 per cent of the population . But even if the radicals ' interpretation had been sound , they would now be compelled , on their own reasoning , to reverse it . For the figures just published reverse the results of a year ago . They show an increase in each bracket in 1934 as compared with 1933 in both the number and total incomes of persons with incomes of up to $100,000 a year , and a reduction both in numbers and in total income of those reporting incomes of more than $100,000 a year . The number of persons with milliondollar incomes declined from forty-six in 1933 to thirty-two in 1934 , and their total income from $82,000,000 to $57 , - 000,000 . It would be just as dangerous to interpret the present results hastily , however , as it was to interpret those , a year ago . Certainly 1934 was a more prosperous year than 1933 . To take but one index , this was plainly indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions , according to the compilation of the Standard Statistics Company , reported total earnings in 1934 of $1,622,000,000 , an increase of 27 per cent over those of 1933 . The figure of total net income on the 1934 tax returns ? $12,456,000,000 ? itself shows this , for it is 15 per cent higher than the amount reported on the 1933 returns . Perhaps the decline reported in the largest earnings is to be accounted for bby a purely technical factor . In the 1932 Income Tax Law the tax on " capital gains " from the sale of property held more than two years did not exceed 12% per cent . In the Revenue Act of 1934 , capital gains were taxed at the same rate as other income . It was provided , however , that in computing his net income the taxpayer had to report only 80 per cent of his gain if the property sold had been held for more than a year , only 60 per cent if it had been held for more than two years , 40 per cent for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held for more than ten years . The fact that , in spite of a fall in the amount of income reported for the brackets over $100,000 , there was in each such bracket an increase in the actual amount of tax paid tends to confirm this explanation . But exact interpretations of the tax returns will not be possible until more detailed figures are available .
