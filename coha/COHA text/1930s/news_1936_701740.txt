txt Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad for January had a good increase in gross revenues compared with the 611,037.809 reported for the corresponding month of last year . However , weather conditions increased expenses so that only a small part of the increased gross was carried through to net , with the result that the company 's loss for January was only slightly smaller than for the same month in 1935 , when a deficit after charges 3f $508,130 was shown . Business so far in February is running ahead of a year ago and also above the preceding month . Last year gross was less in the second month than in the first . Total operating revenues for February , 1935 , were $10,718,809 . The B. &; 0 . has long wanted to put into effect lower passenger fares but has not done so at the request of the other eastern cairiers which say it would coat them $25.000.000 a year . The company is awaiting with great interest the forthcoming decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the passenger fare case . If the commission should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coaches and 3 cents in Pullmans , with the abolition of the surcharge , the B. &; 0 . is likely to be pleased . If the commission should only recommend the lower rates , the B. &; 0 . would still be in a quandary about the matter in view of the attitude of other large eastern carriers . However , the road then would feel that if it did immediately file tariffs for the lower fares , the commission would approve them whereas , until such a decision is handed down , the B. &; 0 . has not felt sure it would be successful if it should seek commission approval . The present basic passenger fare in the East is 3.6 cents a. mile .
