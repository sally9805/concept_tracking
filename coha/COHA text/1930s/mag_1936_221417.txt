Only since 1925 has Japan had what passes in the Empire for " universal manhood suffrage . " Last week a few dainty Japanese feminists toddled about the larger cities exhorting men to " Vote , Please ! " and wearing scarfs reading not " Votes for Women " but " Pure Election . " <P> Up to last week there had never been a Japanese election in which the party favored by the Government failed to win . After ten years of this , popular apathy was such that in the present general election campaign many candidates rode out to rural constituencies to find the halls hired for their speeches quite empty . <P> All candidates who wished to circulate campaign literature were compelled by a new law to do so through the Government , and peasants appeared puzzled to be handed by one local official in their village half a dozen different appeals . By this new system , as an eminent Japanese remarked , " Our elections have been purged of much bribery and corruption and of all political importance . " This overstatement did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarists are by &; large against the Rich , whom they consider chicken-hearted profiteers , and for the Poor , in whom they fancy reside sterling Japanese virtues . If that be radicalism , then the militarists , although they are the world 's most violent reactionaries in matters of Japanese Emperor-worship and imperial conquest , are radical . <P> Any change must be slow in coming to a parliamentary system so formalized and impotent as Japan 's . Nevertheless , it has been suddenly observed in recent weeks that Japan 's few rabble-rousing proletarian candidates were actually drawing audiences of respectable size . As the slow Japanese counting of votes began , a big surprise broke last week when the previously minuscule Social Masses Party was seen to have won 18 seats in the new Diet , all of which will be occupied by thoroughgoing rabble-rousers who can make Japanese politics lively if they dare . <P> Emperor an Organ ? Of the total of 466 Diet seats nearly all were contested by machine candidates of the two large and wealthy Japanese parties , the Seiyukai and the Minseito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , if any , were . This astounding state of affairs existed despite the fact that there had been no Japanese election since 1932 . In theory the poll last week should have settled the paramount issue of Eastern Asia , whether Japanese expansion is to rage on through China at staggering cost or whether the Japanese people disapprove the extravagant and risky militarism which has been the Japanese Government 's main policy for the past four years . This central issue was so packed with dynamite-the politicians fearing that the militarists , if crossed , might sweep away all parliamentary institutions-that it simply was not raised . Only one issue of any sort reached the dignity of figuring in dispatches : the " Emperor Organ Issue . "
