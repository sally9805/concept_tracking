BE A RAILROAD MAN FOR A DAY ! " Off the Beaten Path " Scenic and Historical Tour 356 miles for $3.50 BRING YOUR BOY-BRING YOUR CAMERA See the Railroad " Behind the Scenes " Posters such as this in Chicago last week testified to a brand new development in U. S. railroad sales technique . It is traditional for small boys to want to be locomotive engineers . U. S. railroads have lately discovered that many an adult male has never outgrown that ambition . Result in the past three months has been an epidemic of " Off the Beaten Path " railway tours whose success has been as immediate and as surprising to railroad men as was the popularity of the first snow train . <P> First " Off the Beaten Path " tour occurred on the Pennsylvania R. R. last July when 200 railroad addicts left Philadelphia to spend a day junketing over little-used side lines , seeing little-seen countryside . The passenger list jumped to 500 for the second excursion over another route in August . Since then there have been some half dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ind . Last week 's was the first out of Chicago , was in many ways the best of all . <P> Chosen as sponsor by the Pennsylvania was the Chicago Chapter of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society-a group of some 50 businessmen who " love locomotives , " trade each other pictures of them . They and their families were joined by some 150 members of the Model Makers Guild , enough others of the general public to crowd the twelve day-coaches with 468 people , 400 of whom carried cameras . Present were railroad enthusiasts from Illinois , Wisconsin , Indiana , Pennsylvania . Each was given a mimeographed guide sheet with minute details of the route , the histories of towns , the identity of every grade-crossing and switchback along the way . Route was southeast from Chicago , over trackage unused by passenger trains for years , to Logansport , Ind. , then northeast to La Otto , southeast again to Fort Wayne . There the one-day railroaders went through the Pennsyl vania 's divisional shops . Meanwhile the engine was changed from a double-header K-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This power whipped the train back to Chicago over the mainline route of the Detroit Arrow in record time . <P> Frequently during the first half of the journey , the train stopped to let enthusiasts get pictures of historic spots or routine railroad practice " behind the scenes . " Highlights were a refueling station near Hebron , an old covered bridge near Liberty Mills , the engine house at Fort Wayne , where a turntable was turned , engineers posed and various locomotives were arrayed with placards explaining size , name , power , type , use . At each stop there were lectures by guides in overalls and white gauntlets . Other amusements consisted of a World Series broadcast , bridge games , an accordion player . Next trip is scheduled for Oct. 25 . <P> Yet to be offered by an alert railroad is an " Off the Beaten Path " junket with excursionists riding in the locomotive cab or perched on miniature bleachers built into the tender .                   @ @
