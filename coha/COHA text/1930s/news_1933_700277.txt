txt Surcharge Permitted . To the Editor of The New York Times : I am glad to note that Mr. Levitt corrected the erroneous comparison which he previously made relative to electric prices of the Tennessee Valley Authority and those charged by private companies . I am sorry that an Assistant Attorney General of the United States should have stopped short of making a full correction which would have required him to call attention to the fact that the Tennessee Valley Authority contracts specifying the low domestic prices call also for a subsidy to be paid by commercial and industrial users in order to make good the losses caused by the low domestic rates until such time as same May become self-supporting by reason of the greatly increased volume of business which the low prices are expected to stimulate . I quote verbatim from the contract recently executed between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the city of Tupelo , Miss. : " 6 . Developmental Surcharge ? Contractor ( Tupelo ) agrees not to depart from the resale rates set forth in Schedule B without first securing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to maintain contractor 's revnines in the developmental period in which the increased demand for power nay not compensate for the greatly reiuced rates provided for in Schedule B , 3ontractor may impose a surcharge upon the provisions of said schedule . " SAMUEL FERGUSON . Hartford , Conn. , Dec. 2 , 1933.
