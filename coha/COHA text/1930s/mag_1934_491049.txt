W HEN I and another youngster named Askin started out to produce our first show , we had a total capital of about $1.75 , which made dodges very much in order . We picked Philadelphia to be the historic spot , largely because  --  accidentally  --  my credit happened to be pretty goad there . I 'd been doing publicity work in Philadelphia for about a year  --  things like selling the public the idea that a certain soprano 's voice was half an octave higher than Patti 's , with a neat little printed chart to prove it ; and getting eminent clergymen to give teas for lovely leading ladies  --  and there 'd been one occasion in that city when I had a whole thousand dollars all my own . But I 'd always had a tendency to keep the circulation of the currency going , and when Askin blew into town with his bright idea , about our only asset was a general impression in Philadelphia that Tyler might be a good man to tie to . Askin 's idea was pretty bright at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Lederer 's The Passing Show , a new kind of thing called a review , and although we were a bit hazy as to just how to proceed , that did n't stop us from making up our minds to produce a review called Miss Philadelphia  --  in Philadelphia . That was the point . In those days , civic pride was civic pride , and the odds were all in favor of anything with a local touch in the title , so all we needed were the mere details of some money , somebody to write the book and music , a cast , scenery and costumes . It 's a credit to something  --  our cheek , I think  --  that we got them all out of thin air . Where Angels Fear to Tread /SKIN went tearing back to New York  --  on a free pass , naturally ; we 'd have been ashamed then to pay railroad fare , even if we 'd been able to  --  and he seemed to have no diffieulty at all in persuading Edgar Smith to write the book and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and smooth talker . My headquarters in Philadelphia were in the new Walton Hotel , then the biggest and most expensive in town , an excellent place for putting up a front . I got all that splendor on credit and had n't paid my bill in months  --  the manager , dear Bob Dunlap , was a very good friend of mine and had apparently forgotten how to ask me for money . So the evening after Askin got back he and I sat down among all that magnificence and cast round in our minds for a really first-class leading lady . I suggested Nancy McIntosh , one of the more brilliant prima donnas of the day , and Askin jumped at the idea . We were sort of daring each other to see who had the most nerve , I think . I scribbled out a telegram , offering Miss McIntosh the lead in this unwritten review at the mere trifle of a hundred and fifty dollars a week , and shoved it casually over to Askin . " All right , " I said , " go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " you send it . " We looked at each other hard and then went together over to the cigar counter and borrowed a quarter to pay for the telegram . The next morning she wired back , accepting . That settled it . We were in for it now , and neither one of us had sense enough to be alarmed . The system of kiting checks was newer then than it is now and with the proper juggling you could make it go a long way . We worked it to a fare-yewell and financed that show on nothing else . Askin had a friend in an upstate hank who furnished him with a grand , big cheek book with his name embossed in gold on the outside  --  the checks were gilt-edged , too ; just the kind of stage-prop to inspire confidence  --  and with that for sole credentials , we started out to raise the wind . There were lots of hotels and restaurants and places in town willing to cash checks for me . When we needed money for deposits an scenery or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers to death , we 'd cash a check , pay cash , and then , before the check got to our out-of-town bank , cash a bigger one and wire the money up to the bank to cover . It 's a fine system as long as you ran make the next one bigger than the last one  --  and approximately fool-proof if you are able to work fast . Wo worked fast all right , We had to work so fast before it was over that just keeping the cheeks moving and getting the money to the bank on time turned into a full-time job for both of us . Toward the end there was one crazy afternoon when we had messenger boys on three different trains , each one carrying another wad of bills that was the only thing between us and jail . And try as we might to distribute our attentions round town to avoid suspicion , people began to get wise to what we were doing . It was a little rough on my dignity when Larry McCormick , the manager of the famous Bellevue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred dollars : " I suppose this is the check that makes the last one good , is n't it ? " When we were selecting costume materials in Marks Brothers ' place , and paying by check , old Marks called us into his private office and advised us in a whisper to get connected with a bank in Texas , which would give us more time to come and go on . I swear I think that before long all Philadelphia knew what was going on , but by that time they all stood to lose as much as we did , and they carried us along like gentlemen . Dead Men 's Shoes ANYWAY , that check business kept us so busy we did n't have much time to do anything about the show itself , except worry now and then . We 'd taken a passing glance at Edgar Smith 's book and we 'd met the cast sort of casually when we hired them ; occasionally we ran into the stage manager by accident and he 'd generally tell us everything was going fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost our only connection with the thing was to pay the bills when they could n't possibly be avoided and sweat a little more blood making the checks good in time . However , we did turn up in the theater just before the dress rehearsal and then discovered that we had n't bothered  --  or had n't been able , I forget which  --  to buy the patent-leather pumps for the male chorus . But we had n't been risking nervous break-downs for months to have a little thing like that stump us . The stores were all closed , but somebody remembered there was an undertaker 's place across the street , and undertakers , like doctors , are always open . So we routed out the undertaker , who was a very nice fellow , and made a deal with him for a lot of assorted sizes of the heel-less pumps he used in his business . The chorus did n't take , to the idea very much  --  after all , an omen like that was enough to kill six shows dead  --  but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia boys sang and danced as lively as all get-out in dead men 's shoes . What we deserved was a complete flop and a few years apiece in jail , of course . But dead men 's shoes turned out to be good luck , and Miss Philadelphia was a decided success . I used to stand in the back of the house and enjoy the performance just as much as if somebody else had put it on . It was almost totally new to me and as pleasant a surprise as I 'd ever had in my life . Here it was  --  songs and jokes and pretty girls and lots of money rolling into the box office  --  and half of it belonged to me , which did n't quite make sense . I 'd been so long absorbed in making big checks grow where little cheeks grew before that I 'd almost forgotten the question of success or failure . A Victor and His Spoils T HAT half did n't belong to me very long , and as for Askin , he 'd left town in disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , there was no doubt of that ; but no show produced in those days could have made money fast enough to keep up with that galloping bank account of ours . The only answer was to go back to the old game and cash some more checks to tide us over , and I just could n't see myself renewing that agony . So I went to the people I 'd pulled my Patti stunt for and made them an offer . For a thousand dollars cash and a guaranty to protect our outstanding cheeks , they could have Miss Philadelphia , lock , stock and barrel . They gave me my cheek for a thousand  --  the only good check I 'd seen for some while  --  and I took it round and gave it to the manager of my hotel , where my bill had just about reached a thousand . Bob laid it on the desk and looked at it in sort of a dizzy way , and then said : " My God , George , you do n't intend to pay all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I want . to hold out twenty-five dollars . " " Why twenty-five ? " says he . " Well , " I said , " after the three months ' hell I 've been through , I think I owe myself a celebration . " " You do , " he says , reaching for his hat , " and I 'll celebrate with you . " So he did . That one large evening was all the profit I ever got out of producing a bit the first time at bat , and in a day or two I was back in New York rather more broke than ever . All I 'd learned from it was a terrific taste for the indescribable feeling that goes with looking at a show and knowing it 's yours , so , if anything , I was still riper for trouble than I had been before . And I had n't warmed my bench in the Sturtevant House for long when trouble turned up in the shape of a little man named Fred Miller , who 'd written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted some solid management to finance and produce it . The fellow who brought him round had told him that I was the highly conservative and able manager he was looking for , and it did n't seem up to me to deny it . I 'd been doing considerable thinking while I 'd been sitting and I 'd come to the conclusion that if I could only lay hands on some kind of a show  --  almost any kind  --  I could coin money out of it by taking it to Baltimore and playing a benefit for tho Orioles baseball team , the famous old Orioles , the club the sports writers are still talking about , with Ned Hanlon for manager and . John McGraw and Hughie Jennings and Wilbert Robinson , Gleason , Keeler , and the rest of them . They were winning something like their third championship in succession , and nothing was too good for them in the home town . It was another fine way of cashing in on civic pride , even if I did have to hand over a big percentage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time on the little man 's script  --  I would n't have been much farther along if I had , my judgment being what it was  --  I just accepted it and chased off to Baltimore to get Hanlon 's approval of the idea . Then I heard that young William Knabe was getting bored with the piano business , so I showed him my contract with Hanlon and he advanced me three thousand dollars to produce the thing on  --  incidentally , the name of it was Nancy Lee . Even in those times you could n't do much of an opera for three thousand dollars , but I picked up the old scenery from Harbor Lights for a song and got Digby Bell to become the star by promising him his name would appear in bigger type than his friend and rival , De Wolf Hopper , had ever enjoyed , and I scraped the costumes together out of another old production , and Nancy Lee set sail for Baltimore . It was secondhand from props to plot , produced by an unknown small-timer like me and authored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't prevent us from billing it as a splendid production of a " magnificent new comic , opera by the well-known and talented Fred Miller " and all the rest of it . A Hit in a Pinch E REHEARSED in Baltimore V V for the excellent reason that our connection with the Orioles made credit a lot easier there . And all the way through to the opening we played the Orioles game clear across the board . Every afternoon the whole company piled into busses and went out to the ball park to yell itself hoarse for the home team . We had banners all over the busses proclaiming that this was the Nancy Lee company that would play two big benefits for the glorious Orioles on such and such a date . It was grand ballyhoo while it lasted .. We took in ( Continued on Pas . 418 ) NOY TEAT BY MiTYMERS ( Continued from Page 15 ) all of seven thousand dollars during our two benefit nights and that left a lot even when the ball club 's share was taken out . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost practically all the money during the rest of the week , and Saturday night saw us just about where we started , which means with nothing much more than a few thin dimes . The company was pretty discouraged , and naturally some of the principals began discovering that they never had thought much of this opera anyway . As for me , being steadily in a dazed frame of mind , I never did know what I thought of Nancy Lee ; it was mine , what there was of it , and I never could get any farther . Anyway , I was certainly in so deep I didn't. dare stop to figure it out , so I took it to Philas delphia and did very badly , and then to Washington the week after and did much worse . Washington was so discouraging to the barytone and the soubrette and the contralto  --  in other words , most of the principals  --  that they all left me flat after the final performance , without even bothering to tell me what they were up to . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it just about floored me . You see , we were booked into Atlanta for Monday , and that meant a real chance to pay salaries and recoup ourselves for all the other people 's money we 'd already lost , Atlanta was holding a big exposition and any old kind of show was sure to sell out to the very doors . The citizens were taking their visitors to the theater just to show off the theater , and it did n't matter at all what was playing . Civic pride some more . I still had to figure out how we were going to get as far as Atlanta  --  without cash enough in the whole company to move us beyond Richmond  --  even with the fares of three of the principals missing ! Well , I tramped round Washington all morning , only to find that everybody I knew was hiding from me , which was very good judgment on their parts . Along about one o'clock I got really discouraged and wandered into the Raleigh Hotel to sit down for a moment and get acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was Mare Elms , Erlanger 's partner . He came across and we went to Atlanta in style , and with a special Pullman sleeper to rehearse in on the way . And we sure had a lot of rehearsing to do , for we had to give the barytone the tenor 's lines and music and switch the soprano into the contralto part and lift a girl out of the chorus to play the soubrette . Of course , that made even more of a mess out of Nancy Lee than the poor thing had been to begin with , but that hardly mattered now . The Midas Touch in Atlanta All the rumors about Atlanta were gloriously true . We paid off every cent we owed in those four performances ; the way money poured in you 'd have thought Nancy Lee was Barnum 's greatest show on earth , and it was only natural that we thought so too . Full of now life , we started off to tour . We were going to clean up the South and Middle West , and the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago would be the best place to settle down on for a long run . I wired to New York for a first-class barytone to meet us in Jacksonville . But the minute we left Atlanta hard times settled down again and stuck with us closer than a brother . It was literally true that after Atlanta we never played a single performance to a profit . We hardly ever played to enough to pay hotel bills and railroad fare to the next stand . When Hubert Wilke , our new barytone , met us in Jacksonville , the first thing he did was strike me for some money in advance . He 'd heard something , of course . I looked at him hard and asked how much . " At least a hundred , " says he , gritting his teeth . I turned my back on him so he could n't see my roll and peeled off a ' hundred and handed it to him , which left us just eleven dollars in the world . That was the last money Hubert saw during the whole tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most anybody had for the next . few months was enough to get a shave with  --  and that would be comparatively flush times . But , by gosh , we kept on going . Dozens of times it looked as if we were down for the count , but for a long time we always managed to wiggle on to the next . town . How Actors Lived on Nothing Honestly , it was nothing short of a miracle the way barnstorming troupes like ours could travel over the country on nothing at all , even less than nothing . Of course , it took expert technic on everybody 's part .. By talking fast you could sometimes jolly the railroads into cutting rates way down , for all the railroads were in cutthroat competition then , and whenever you had a choice of routes you could play them against each other scandalously . Lots of times they did it just to get rid of us . We hit Thomasville , Georgia , right after the Sells Bros. circus , which was bad . It also happened to be Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before we arrived . Between him and the circus there was n't a great deal of loose money left . We got all there was  --  ninety-eight dollars  --  which would n't begin to pay the hotel bills and move us on to Selma for the next night . So I proceeded to get into the good graces of the local ticket agent , and persuaded him to take a chance on losing his job and get me the general manager of the line on the private wire at his home in Savannah . The O. M. got out of bed and listened to me for half an hour , and then instructed the agent : " For the Lord 's sake , ticket ' em to Selma for nothing and let me get some sleep ! " Again , even if you did have to pay something , there were all kinds of ways of beating the game . We never bought more than sixty tickets for our company of sixty-five . We could n't keep the conductor from counting the tickets , but when he tried counting noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't count twice the same way to save his life . Touring in the South  --  in those days Southern trains just crept along  --  some of the men in the chorus would slip out of the car as soon as the counting began and run alongside ahead , keeping out of sight till they could climb on the front car after the conductor had passed through . Of course , wo had our troubles with sheriffs and landlords and such , and plenty of them . There never was enough to pay everybody 's board bill . We had a fine system of checking the heavy baggage out long in advance of our train  --  hoping we 'd take a train  --  and then through smart teamwork we 'd smuggle the hand baggage away little by little . Anybody who tried to attach the outfit was completely out of luck , since we carried a bill of sale for the production and transferred it to a different person every day , so it was actually true that nobody ever knew who Nancy Lee belonged to . Now and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next stand , hopefully expecting to collect , off the next day 's receipts , but usually there was n't enough to pay them the price of a return ticket . I remember a young fellow from the St. George in Evansville who went with us to Terre Haute that way . The train stopped for lunch at Vincennes and he very politely stood up and asked if anybody in the troupe would like to have lunch with him . The whole company rose as one man , and Bell , the star , was the first one out the door . It 's probably hard to believe , but it was honestly true , though , that nobody gave a darn . We were all in for it and we all loved one another and most of the time we were as happy as kids on a picnic . About every day we ran into some kind of crisis serious enough to have broken up a modern production ten times over , but then it was all in the day 's work . They were all troupers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to speak lines . And except for that one wholesale desertion in Washington  --  and that was before we really got going  --  everybody stuck by the ship . Once in a while , in the smaller towns , we 'd come close to breaking even and kid ourselves into being encouraged all over again . We got $316 in one small town  --  funny how I can remember those exact figures forty years later , but they were life and death then  --  and gave it to the hotel manager to keep in the safe for us . It was one of those dead and buried small-town hotels next door to the feed store , with three broken-down chairs in the lobby and the keys hung on to blocks of wood . " Did you get all that money here ? " exclaimed the manager . " Why , that only leaves eighty-four dollars in town to do business on . " Competing With Lillian Russell After that we tackled Nashville and tried to compete with Lillian Russell , who was then at the very height of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high for the road in those times , and we figured with our undying optimism that at a dollar and a half we 'd get all the business . It . did n't work that way . She got $1802 and we got $218 . Once again we were stuck without railroad fare , and for once all my finagling fell flat . The only hope left was that Digby Bell , our star , had once been Miss Russell 's leading comedian . I laid hands on him in the hotel lobby  --  this was past midnight already  --  and told him to go up and strike Miss Russell for a loan to get us out of town . He said he 'd rather die . I said that was just what he would do if he did n't got that money . So he dragged himself over to the desk and sent up word that Mr. Bell would like to see Miss Russell . She was still up  --  playing poker , it turned out  --  and would be glad to see him . tip he went , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down I sat to wait . While I was waiting and fuming and fretting , who should come trailing in but young Otis Skinner , also barnstorming and also in a very bad fix , a little worse off than we were , if possible . We started condoling with each other and then he happened to mention that his company was headed for Atlanta , if they could ever manage to get there . " I wish to heaven that 's where we were going , " says I , and then I told him about how money grew in the Atlanta , streets and that all you had to do was to open the doors and be swamped with business . I never saw such a change in a man 's expression . From then on he made me sit there and babble to him about thousands of dollars  --  he fairly got drunk on the idea . It was pretty tough talking for me who had no such outlook . I think I 'd have left him flat if there 'd been any other place I dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it got later and later and still no signs of Bell , or money either . The Luck in a Poker Game It was four in the morning before Bell finally came down , yelling out : " I 've got it ! She 's a queen ! She gave it to me without turning a hair ! " " That 's good , " says I , " hut why in hell were you so long about it ? " " I could n't interrupt the poker game , could I ? " he says , sort of pathetically . The poor devil had been standing up there for four solid hours watching nice fat sums of money change hands and had n't been able to work up his courage to utter a syllable . Then we got moving  --  got the chorus out of hock , loaded up the scenery , that . was falling apart by this time , and headed for Evansville on a morning train , leaving Skinner just gone to bed to dream of Atlanta thousands . Evansville was very bad medicine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and during our performance there he attached the box-office receipts for back royalties and , what was even worse , got out a writ that took the book and music away from us . We could get along fairly well without money , but there was n't any way of getting along without the book and music . I walked home with him after the battle and persuaded him to return the opera ; it certainly was n't worth anything to him and it was all the world to us . He was n't a bad sort of man ; he even lent me ten dollars out of our own receipts to rustle round town with . But it was the beginning of the end . In Terre Haute , Bell found somebody soft enough to lend him his fare back to New York and Ile left us flat . Without the star , we just could n't survive . The only thing left to do was to get the remaining members of the company back home . I sent a pleading telegram to my old friend Jim Shriver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole lot to New York and took my word for payment , and there we were . Or rather , there they were , all back home without having lost a single trunk . I had stopped over in Baltimore to thank Shriver . While there I got a bee in my bonnet about the Corbett , Fitzsimmons fight , which was about to come off in Carson City , the fight that put " solar plexus " into the American language . If I could lay hands on a theater and get the telegraph company to run a ringside wire on to the stage , could get a lot of customers to listen to the blow-by-blow story of the fight. , Baltimore being a regular sporting town in those days . I got the theater on spec all right , but the telegraph company wanted too much for their services  --  and in advance , which was just funny . But a little thing like that would n't spoil my scheme . I hired a couple of telegraph operators with their instruments to rig up a wire from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relay system of messenger boys who copied down the blow-by-blow bulletins from the newspaper windows down town and rushed them to the operator in the dressing room . He clicked the bulletins off to the man on the stage " direct from the ringside " as advertised . The operator on the stage put up a fine , exciting show and we had a big crowd , and they had a swell time ; the only misfortune was that when they got out on the street they found the fight had been over for a full hour . It was n't the messenger boys ' fault  --  they just had too far to run . After that Corbett-Fitzsimmons stunt I returned to New York feeling a little too big for my breeches , as we used to say out home . I 'd produced two shows and toured one for weeks , and the fact . that one of them had made me very little and the other had succeeded only in supplying a meal ticket that generally was n't paid for to sixty-five very nice people meant nothing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the theatrical world buzzing and booming  --  it was pretty exciting just then  --  Oscar Hammerstein had opened his Olympia and was cutting a big dash , and the famous theatrical syndicate was in full swing . The whole country bad gone crazy over Lottie Collins and Ta-ra-raboom-de-ay . The theater was growing amazingly popular and I did n't see why a bright young man with all my experience should n't join the party . Why not give an open-air , all-star performance of As You Like It in the woods near Asbury Park ? I felt that it was high time I got out of the smalltime class and went in for big names . Some well-intentioned people thought so , too , and advanced me a couple of thousand to do it on , and then I went gunning for a tremendous cast . I got it all right  --  Robert Mantell , Marie Wainwright , Camille D'Arville , Jimmy Powers , Thomas Q. Seabrooke  --  the summer being a slack season , I could get them by using the other names for bait  --  and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wrestler and lot Mantell throw him . That was Muldoon 's specialty ; he was a big draw , having been Grieco-Roman wrestling champion , and a really big production of As You Like It was n't complete without the opening touch of some star actor rolling Muldoon over on his back when Muldoon could have broken him in two . Running Out on Shakspere I 'd had to promise all my stars their pay in advance of curtain time and , of course , I counted on the receipts to do it . But when Camille D'Arville and the other singers struck up the preliminary music out there in the woods there just were n't enough receipts to begin to pay off , and by that time of course there was n't a. cent left of the original two thousand . I could n't see myself calmly informing that east of big guns that they 'd have to settle for fifty cents on the dollar , and I was trying to get some good advice from William A. Brady , who was among the mourners , when a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me . That settled it . I left Brady behind to persuade them that they 'd get as much money as possible  --  after all , he 'd been a fight manager and maybe he could pacify Muldoon better than I could  --  and I struck for the woods . I didn't. stop moving till I was clear the other side of New York at Frank Daniels ' house in Rye , and it was about . three weeks before anybody saw me again . I still hear about it occasionally from some old-timer . Jimmy Powers says it was the only time he ever did . Shakspere and Shakspere did him . But I finally came back for more , out of sheer inability to learn sense . There was a note in some paper that the great Charles Coghlan had finished a Georgian play and hoped to produce it in the autumn . I admired Coghlan above all other actors , so down I sat with even more than my usual nerve and wrote him a note asking him to let me have a look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded pretty good , and Coghlan did n't know I owed the management a- $200 board bill and had no money to pay it with ; but then I did n't know that . Coghlan himself was living in a hall bedroom . That was the reason he suggested my hotel as the best place for the reading . Of course , I could n't let him find out I was living in a single room just big enough to hold a bed and a chair  --  I 'd have to take him into the dining room , even though I knew that Coghlan never drank anything but champagne , and I just did n't have the price of even a glass of water . Priming a Playwright So there , one fine afternoon , was Coghlan , quite friendly in his haughty , dignified way , sitting with me at one of the rear tables in the empty dining room  --  and the manuscript in his pocket . Only one thing was lacking . Would n't Mr. Coghlan have some champagne ? Why , yes , thanks , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Coghlan suggested the vintage  --  with my heart in my mouth . The waiter looked at me peculiarly , then summoned the head waiter , who walked slowly by us , looking at me very hard before he summoned the manager . The manager studied me  --  I could fairly see " 8200 " written on his forehead  --  and , though he nodded his head very slowly and hesitantly , he nodded it . I never will know how much that champagne cost me in years taken off my life , but it warmed Coghlan up to read his play as only he could read it , and before he 'd left we 'd already laid out the terms of the contract . I was crazy to get my hands on that play  --  I thought it was grand and , of course by accident , I was n't far wrong  --  and Coghlan , who 'd been second fiddle to his famous sister Rose all his life , was mighty anxious to star on his own in a grand role . Thus the only thing that stood between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once more the mere lack of a few thousand with which to produce it . Not a cent could I raise for the next few days . All I could get out of anybody I knew was some first-class kidding about Shakspere and Asbury Park . Then I got wind of a. man named . Liebler whose printing plant had , unfortunately , been wrecked in the Park Place disaster , costing him a fortune , but he had saved 83000 out or the mess . Maybe it was ( Continued on Page 72 ) 72 THE SETURDAY EVENING POST January 27,1954 ( Continued from Page 69 ) just desperation on his part , but anyway he wanted to invest it all in a theater venture . I went to work on him tike a cyclone . For a while it was touch and go between The Royal Box  --  that was the name of Coglilan 's play  --  and a play that somebody was trying to persuade Liebler to invest . in , starring Go-Wan-Go-Mohawk , the Indian mail carrier , but he finally decided that . Coghlan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was  --  and Liebler Co. came into existence . Coghlan 's great prestige was of course , a lot of help in getting together a fine cast , and Liebler 's money held out just exactly long enough to get us to Washington for the opening . It was a grand play and great performances were given , but business was so bad in Washington that when Mr. Erlanger heard of our misery he wired me a considerate offer of a job as advance man again . Friendly people were careful to tell me I was a fool not to take it , but Liebler and I insisted on keeping The Royal Box out on the road for three weeks more , heaven knows how . Then Liebler begged us a three weeks ' booking at the Fifth Avenue Theater in New York , and we trailed into the big town about licked to a frazzle . Right away , of course , the way things often used to happen , the blessed play was a huge success  --  or rather Coghlan was . In three nights we were playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the American stage , which he undoubtedly was , although the newspapers bad taken a long time to discover the obvious fact . Scenes Not in the Script I never saw such a feast and a famine as that play turned out to be . Just when we 'd made up our minds that there were millions in it , a deputy sheriff , the first one of a flock , walked into the box office and attached the receipts for a board bill of Coghlan 's dating back to the time earlier that year when he'd. eloped with a girl named Kuhns Beveridge and married her . It took the wind out of me  --  I 'd been hoping that I 'd seen my last of deputies  --  so I went tearing backstage to have it out with Coghlan . There was only one way to impress him  --  burst in , shout at him , swear at him , get the whole thing off your chest and then exit as fast as possible  --  if you let him get a word . in edgewise he was certain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was just . in the mood to do it up brown and I started down the side aisle to go behind the stage  --  just then he was playing a quiet scene  --  about the best scene in the play it . was  --  and by instinct I pulled . up to keep from distracting the audience . By the time the curtain came down I 'd forgotten all about any sheriff trouble  --  I just stood there and gaped over Coghlan 's magnificence ; I even joined in the applause . That was the kind of actor he was  --  he could hold me tighter than a dozen deputies could , and yet I 'd seen him play that scene twenty times and knew it backward . I have seen all the great ones of my time and worked with a good many of them , but Charles Coghlan , whose name had formerly always appeared in small type in the billing below Rose COGHLAN 'S , was the greatest . He had everything . He 'd taught Rose all she knew . His invariable rebuke to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a grin : " So like my sister Rosie ! " His sheer ability made it possible for him to get away with murder when he wanted to . He was advertised to support his sister in Wilde 's A Woman of No Importance one year , but had to leave the rehearsals for a while when the newspapers got too inquisitive about his sensational elopement , and what with honeymooning and such , he did n't remember so very much about the play when he finally turned up in it again . In the scene where the illegitimate son  --  Aubrey Boucicault played the part  --  pleads with his father  --  Coghlan , that was  --  to marry his mother . " You will marry my mother ? " says the boy  --  Wilde had writ ten a couple of hundred words for the father 's answer . The first night Coghlan appeared he just looked at Boucicault for about twenty seconds and then stuck his monocle in his eye with : " I beg your pardon ? " Boucicault took a long breath , and with quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will marry my mother ? " " Yes , " says Coghlan with a grunt , " but it 's so damned conventional . " I asked him about it afterward . " What could I say ? " he replied . " Damned long stupid speech ; simply could n't learn it . " That line stayed in the play for the rest of the run . Because of Coghlan 's old debts , we continued to have a steady procession of deputy sheriffs at the box office who endeavored to lick up every cent we could make . We thought we 'd be rid of trouble when we took the play on the road , but Coghlan was famous for being completely indifferent to money . His hotel bill of seven or eight hundred a week put profits out of the question . I know it sounds incredible again , but we really did n't mind very much . He was such a magnificent actor and such an overwhelming person that we were more than paid in full by the sheer joy we took in being associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that way about the great actors . Still and all , that kind of payment could n't be entered on the books , and the second season of The Royal Box found me just as broke as before . It was tantalizing to have achieved success in everything but profit  --  tantalizing but hopeful to so optimistic a young ass as I. So I played the same system again and bet on another of my admirations when the chance came along  --  Viola Allen , this time . I 'd been crazy about her ever since I 'd first seen her as a child of sixteen playing Esmeralda . Just to give you an idea  --  she is the only important living actress who has never appeared in any but a star or leading lady 's role . When I saw in the indispensable papers that she was leaving the Empire Theater and plan-mug to star on her own , it was good enough for me . This time I was stepping out . When she got my note , she asked me to come and see her ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine on the way , figuring it might prove a good investment  --  otherwise I was a little seedy , but not conspicuously so . You could n't really tell by just glancing at me that about $6.75 in my pocket was my total capital . Long afterward Viola Allen told me that all the time she was listening to my spellbinding account of what . we would do she couldn't. take her eyes off the high lights on my shoes  --  no doubt she was hypnotized . It seems , too , that my confidence impressed her . She asked me : " How much money are you prepared to lose on the venture , Mr. Tyler ? " ? you see , all the other managers had been telling her they 'd lose any amount to establish her  --  and all I could answer was : " Why , I do n't expect . to lose any . I expect to win from the jump . " It . was no salesman 's line  --  we had to do just that or we were sunk . Dramatizing a Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my forced optimism and started looking for a play . Plenty of plays , but none good enough for us . Finally she mentioned a dramatization of Hall Caine 's The Christian that was floating round  --  one of the year 's best sellers . I 'd read the book , of course , and had a huge respect for its success , so we had the play in and looked it over . When she said she thought it had possibilities , but would need a lot of reworking , I agreed again . Then we  --  principally she  --  figured out the necessary changes , and it was deCided that she would go to England and put them up to the author . That suited me . She was a very famous and highly intelligent and uncommonly beautiful lady , and I was nobody  --  besides , she had the price of the trip and I had n't . Back she came with all the changes as we wanted them and Hall Caine himself in tow . At first Caine could n't get used to Pullman sleepers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his top hat . Not a jarring note came up until after rehearsals started , however  --  then appeared that faint , troubled look in the star 's and author 's eyes every time money was mentioned . I knew that look only too well  --  I 'd met it often before  --  it meant they were wondering just how much cash there was behind the thing . Not that they said anything  --  their manners were too good  --  but they looked at me . At . length they inquired ever so gently when we were going to open in New York and where . Being the last person who could answer that one , I tactfully dodged the issue . I did n't know anybody who would let us have a New York theater , and I could n't blame them . The only thing I could think of was to go round to Mr. Erlanger and tell him my troubles and ask if he would n't like to have a look at the play . After all , his mere presence at a rehearsal would buck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a third interest in it , and from then on n If now was thirty-odd years ago , I would n't have to tell you what hap-pened to The Christian . We were a triumph in Albany , we broke the house record in Washington , and when wo into into the Knickerbocker Theater in New York we went like a house afire , in spite of the press , which damned us thoroughly , particularly the play  --  Willie Winter on the Tribune called it " The Christian Pill . " Between the third and fourth acts on the opening night I tore myself away from the cheering audience long enough to drop into the box office . I wanted somebody to congratulate me and convince me it was all real . There I found the whole theatrical syndicate sitting in a sort ' of choked silence  --  Charles Frohman , Al Hayman , A. L. Erlanger , and Marc Klaw . Nobody was saying a word , there was nothing to hear but the cheering from inside . Finally All Hayman , Al 's six-foot brother , walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger hit than The Little Minister . " That was their biggest success and to have their biggest success outdone by an independent unknown like Liebler &; Co. was just something they could n't grasp . In my first burst of delirium I remember I bet Hayman an overcoat that we 'd play to $15,000 a week as long as we stayed . / won that bet . Good Lord , we won everything . The Christian netted us something like half a million dollars before we were through with it . And the next morning Liebler &; Co. woke up besieged by a whole world that had never before heard of them . Agents , actors , managers , playwrights came swarming round to stand with their hats off and their eyes bulging . We were in . Thousands of dollars began to sprout at the bottom of the weekly balance sheets , thousands on thousands of dollars , and it kept up till we were drowned and gasping . Why , when the company opened in Boston , the following spring , there was a line three times round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater fainted from overwork . It washed me clear off my feet . About the only person who could sympathize with the way I felt would be a grocery clerk who 'd won the Calcutta Sweep . I think the only thing that saved my sanity after the opening was those newspaper reviews that called us so many names  --  they were the only normal touches in a world gone crazy . For years I 'd been telling myself that something like this was going to happen , but I 'd never more than half believed it  --  just daydreaming or nervous habit . or something to keep going on . And now the whole blessed thing had blown up right under my nose , and it was weeks before I could even live sociably with the idea that I was n't somebody else . I did n't know what to make of it , but my creditors did . You bet they did ! Editor 's Note  --  This is the second of a series of articles by George Tyler , written in collaboration with J. C.
