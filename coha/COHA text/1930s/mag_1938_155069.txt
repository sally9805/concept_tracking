In the 30-minute weekly broadcasts of Burns &; Allen , Comedian Gracie Allen gives her radio listeners many a rib-tickling account of her mythical family . Since these relatives , invented for her by the Burns &; Allen gagmen , are either nitwits , convicts or a blend of the two , they are frequently identified by their places of residence-Alcatraz for father , such other Federal and State penitentiaries as San Quentin , Joliet , Sing Sing , Leavenworth for brothers , uncles , cousins . <P> Last week the joke turned sour . After her microphone partner and husband , George Burns , pleaded guilty in Manhattan to two Federal indictments for smuggling ( TIME , Dec. 19 ) , with the case still pending , he flew to Hollywood to ready their radio program . Last Friday they took to the air . Gracie prattled gaily about her fictional family , but on their criminal careers and residences in jail , as well as on the troubles of her real family , she was mumchance.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
