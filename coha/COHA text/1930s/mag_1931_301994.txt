THE OLD-TIME SALOON-George Ade-Long &; Smith ( $1.50 ) . <P> Funnyman Ade 's theme-song in this backward-glancing booklet : " Not wet-not dry-just history . " No believer in the saloon 's return , he can call up visions of its past with a dry eye , a drily humorous tongue . Though he gives a fair imitation of a man straddling the Prohibition fence , on p. 162 he drops over on the Wet side , admits to membership in the Association Against the 18th Amendment . <P> Author Ade pokes heavy fun at those who sentimentalize over " the poor man 's club , " says the brewers brought Prohibition on themselves by the abuses consequent on their forcing the sale of beer . Of the saloon 's denizens only the barkeep emerges unscathed from Author Ade 's hands . " He was at least as human and humane as his contemporaries and much more temperate in his habits . Let his epitaph be kindly . " <P> Primarily " just history , " The Old-Time Saloon is written with serious humor , earmarked here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye , Author Ade describes an oldtime Kentucky belle : " You could span her waist with your two hands but she could n't sit down in a tub . " He recounts the feat of Tom Heath , who was ejected from an Irish saloon on St. Patrick 's Day " because he ate the shamrocks on the bar , thinking they were watercress . " <P> Author Ade 's most astounding assertion : that he has never seen the inside of a speakeasy , never hopes to see one . <P> The Author , Within the memory of living men , 65-year-old George Ade was accounted one of the three brightest boys in Chicago ( the others : Cartoonist John Tinney McCutcheon , Howard Hackett ) . From a reporter on Chicago 's Record George Ade rose to the level of " Mr. Dooley " ( Finley Peter Dunne ) with his Fables in Slang which H. S. Stone &; Co. printed , Clyde J. Newman illustrated . No longer most up-to-date of U. S. slangsters , but wealthy , still unmarried , Author Ade winters in Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Golfing enthusiast , football fan , he is known as Purdue 's patron saint .
