qi7i4-CA9 BANTU WEDDING A STORY BY REGINALD SMITH j " OSEPH , " said my father , whose name is Nyakuno , " it is time for you to marry . Why do n't you choose a girl and take her ? " " Ah ! " I said , " that 's very difficult ! It costs so much to marry . " It was evening . We had finished our food and my sisters were outside cleaning the porridge pot , but they heard us , for I heard them laugh , as girls always do if men speak of weddings . My mother said nothing but she smiled and nodded with Kevuka , my father 's second wife . " But you work for Europeans , " said my father , " and you earn plenty of money . It is time you were a man and had a wife and begot a son . What will your spirit do if you have no son ? " Now my father and all our old people are heathen . They have never learned , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said was right , and I must marry . So I said : " Alt ! It is very difficult ! All the girls ' fathers want too much lobola , * and I am young . " " It is true , " said my father , lighting his pipe from our fire . " All the time they want more and more lobola . When I was a young man I found four cows only , but now they do n't want cows , they must have money  --  twenty-five pounds , thirty pounds , forty pounds . Yes , it is difficult . " But I knew that my father was not troubled by this because he has two daugh- ? Payment made to the girl 's father.ters , Evelina and Alice , and I am his only son . " It is no matter , my son , " said my mother . " You can choose your girl and throw your hoe , and pay your mapsakiraino. - f- I am sure you have money for that . You work for Europeans and you must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For two years I had been earning ten shillings a month and I had been putting money in a Post Office Savings Bank . I think I had six pounds , but I did not like to say so . It is better not . Every year my mother asks me for ten shillings for clothes , and there are my sisters too . They have no boys to buy them clothes . And again , if a girl 's father thinks you have saved money , he will always ask for more . Yes , it is very difficult . So I lied and said : " No , mother . I have only a very little . " " How much ? " said my father quickly . " Ahl I do n't know . Money is very few ! I have not yet paid my tax ? ' I shrugged my shoulders and stretched out all my fingers to show that I had nothing . " No matter , " said my mother comfortably , " you can go to the Post Office and ask for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you can take her home , and little by little you can find the lobola , and some day you will marry . " But I am a good Christian and so I said f Present to the girl 's father . See note in Personal and Otherwise . I could not do like that ; I must marry in church without having a fault . Evelina and Alice had come inside and put away the cooking pot , and they agreed . Girls always like to marry without a fault so that their boys can buy them a European white dress and a veil . " And besides , " said Alice , " if Joseph makes a fault and his girl has a womb , our Teacher will tell the priest , and Joseph and his girl will not be allowed to receive Communion until they are married , and they will have to do punishment work for the church . Ah , no , mother , your plan is no good . But you are a heathen . You have not learned . " " Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking . " " Have n't learned ? " said my mother . " You Christian girls are proud ! You want to marry like those Europeans , do you ? Ah ! I 've seen them ! Women without breasts and houses without children ! And if Joseph marries a girl in church before he takes her perhaps she will be barren , and what can he do then ? " I said : " No , mother , but I am a Christian and my God has forbidden to do like that . We must pray to Him to help us and to give us children . " " Ahal " said my mother softly . " So you have a girl , have you , and you will marry , my son ? " But I said nothing , and my father did not hear , for he was talking to us about Europeans and their customs . It is well known that they are different from us ; they have no spirits and no medicine can touch them . Soon Kevuka and the girls went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my clothes and lay down in my blankets . But I could not sleep . I was thinking of all that had been said and of Naomi Chakanetsa . I have always known her . We played together as piccanins . We went to school together . We were in the same Catechumen class and we were baptized at the same time . But lately we had changed to each other . I would see her perhaps at a beer drink or at church or at a concert , and I would stay withthe other young men and we would make jokes together and laugh for the girls to hear us , and all the time I would try to come a little bit nearer , and perhaps to touch her as one might if one were joking . And I have seen her looking at me and then look away again if I looked up , and then she and the other girls would laugh together , but I never knew why . So now I lay awake in my blankets and I found I could think of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fat and yet so strong and supple . Naomi  --  Naomiit was in my mind , first Iike a song , and then like the voice of a witch telling me I must go to her . At last I got up and put on my trousers and shirt . I went outside . Naomi ! I must go to her . Chakanetsa 's kraal was across the river and then over the mountain , but I went there swiftly , barefooted , running . I came to his kraal , four round huts , and I thought I knew where Naomi lay . But as I drew near a dog ran out barking , and then two more . I threw a stone and said : " Footsack , " and hit one dog in the ribs . But the dog went away yelping , and I was very frightened , because now Chakanetsa must know that it was a man and not only a jackal . So I turned and went home . Afterward I was very glad because I had not been allowed to sin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name to me in the night . But then I only thought what is the good of going to a girl 's house if you have not spoken to her the day before or given her any present ? So when I lay down again I thought I must ask for her and first I must buy her some presents . The next day my boss gave me the postbag with letters to post and told me to fetch his mail . I was very glad of this and I took my bank book with me to the Post Office and drew out twelve shillings , and then I went to Suleman Ismail Cheapy Store . This is a very good store . They will give you a bonseller , and if you say , " This is too much " they are never cheeky , but they will let you have it a lit-tie bit cheaper . And there is a boy there called Dickson who is a friend of mine . He sits outside with a sewing machine , and if you want a dress for your girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bought the stuff . So I said to Dickson : " Good morning ! Have you slept well ? " And we shook hands and then I went in and soon I bought the stuff . Ah ! It was very nice . It had pictures of white girls playing tennis , and plenty of flowers as well . So I gave the stuff to Dickson to make up for Naomi , and then I bought a red comb for Evelina to put in her hair , and big blue glass earrings for Alice , and a white duku and some oil for my mother and a yellow duku for Naomi . Then I had spent all my money , so I asked for a bonseller , and first Mr. Ismail said I had got everything too cheap , and then he gave me a bag of tobacco which I could give to my father . When I got home my father was out but Alice and Evelina and Kevuka were pounding mealier in the stamp and my mother was sewing . I said to all of them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And they all said to me : " Good evening , I have spent the day well if you have . " Then I put down my parcel on the ground and began to open it , and all the women stopped working and came to see . And first I took out the earrings and gave them to Alice , and Alice said : " Ah ! Thank you . " And she knelt to me and clapped her hands . Then I gave the comb to Evelina and she thanked me the same way , and the duku and the oil to my mother and she held my hand in hers for a long time and she said : " Ala My son , my son , my son ! " But I had done foolishly to bring no present to Kevuka . She is only the second wife and she has a barren womb and a jealous heart . So while the girls were laughing and happy she ran away , but my mother kissed my hands and whispered : " Aft , Joseph , my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and the yellow duku ? " And I whispered to her : " It is Naomi Chakanetsa . " Then my mother laughed and kissed my hand again and said , " Myson , you had better go quickly . The sun is nearly set . " Then I was frightened , but my mother said : " Go quickly , Joseph , go ! " So I set off quickly for Chakanetsa 's kraal , and I was very lucky , for when I had crossed the river and was climbing the hill I saw Naomi in front of me , with a big kerosene tin of water on her head . She was walking quickly up the hill , so I called " Naomi ! Naomi ! " and ran to catch up with her . She turned and waited for me , the water still on her head . We greeted each other and I touched her hand . " Naomi ! " I said , showing her the parcel . " I have a present for you . Put down your water a little and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came with me a little way into the bush . We said nothing , but I think we were both trembling very much . Then I showed her the beautiful new dress and the yellow duku , and she knelt before me and received her present in both hands . She put it down and clapped her hands and said : " Ah , Joseph ! Thank you , thank you , " in a soft husky voice , but she would not look into my face . " Naomi , " I said , " I must come to your kraal on Sunday , and I will throw my hoe for you . " She said nothing . I stretched out my hand to take her and she came nearer to me , still trembling . She was very beautiful , and for a long time she stayed in my arms . Suddenly she jumped up . " Joseph , I must go ! Look ! It is dark . My father will be very angry and he will beat me . Help mel Lift the water to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart singing . I knew she would not look at any other boy now . When we had eaten I gave my father my bonseller of tobacco and he was pleased . He had been somewhere to drink beer and he was talking very much . When he was smoking he said : " I have made a plan , Joseph , to help you . It is true that you are young to choose a wife and that it is difficult for you to marry because it costs so much for lobola . So now I will help you . There is the debt of Shigodora . He owes me twelve pounds and two goats . Again and again I go over to his kraal and call to him and curse him and say : ' Where is my money ? When will you pay me ? ' And he always says : ' AM It is very difficult to find money . Give me a month and I will pay . ' But he gives me nothing . To-day I went to see him and he came to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife has been brewing . Come into my house and taste . ' So I went in and Shigodora made me drink and said : It is time for my girl Todini to marry . ' So then he gave me plenty more beer and we talked a long time about Todini and his debt , and now we have agreed you must find five pounds mapsakiraino and you must take Todini . Then you can marry her and pay twelve pounds lobola and two goats to me . You are very lucky to get a wife so cheap ! Shigodora wanted ten pounds more as well , but I was very clever ! " I sat still , with the blood roaring in my ears . I felt as if my father was beating me in the face . " It is impossible , " I said at last . " Todini is a heathen . " " That does not matter ! You can send her to school and she will soon learn and be baptized if you like . " I got to my feet . " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My father was still a little bit drunk and at once he was very angry . " You ca n't ! " he shouted . " Am I not your father and your chief ? 1 have arranged it  --  be done or I 'll flog you , " and he picked up his throwing stick . " Mayiwe , mayiwe ! " said my sisters . They remembered my presents and they were sorry for me . Kevuka laughed scornfully and said : " There 's a good son ! There 's obedience ! And he has not yet learned when he is lucky ! How can a father help a proud son ? " But my mother got up quickly as though to protect me . " Go to your own hut ! " she whispered . " Only be quiet now and all shall be well ! " So I went out . Afterward I listened at the door and I heard my father talking loud and my mother very soft , but always agreeing with him . Kevuka and my sisters she sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quiet and stopped grumbling . I went into my but and I wished that I were dead . Every woman is a liar and now my mother was deceiving me too . Then I remembered that my mother was so clever that she was called " Tsuro " which means " the Hare . " So I said my prayers and lay down and slept . I woke again to hear my mother screaming . It was still dark and I was very frightened . She screamed and screamed again . My father said afterward that she screamed in her sleep and he had trouble to wake her . I got up and went to see what was the matter . My mother was awake now and she sat up , saying " Mayiwe ! Mayiwe ! " She hid her face in her hands and she rocked herself backward and forward . She would not answer us , and at last Alice and Evelina and Kevuka came in too . They were very frightened . It was dark . The fire was dead . " Light that fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ! Are you ill ? " " Mayiwe ! " she wailed . " What is it ? " said my father . " Mayiwe ! " she wailed . " Tell me the matter , " he said , and I knew he was frightened too . Alice was blowing at the fire and the small sticks were beginning to crack . " How can I tell you ? " said my mother . " I am afraid . " It was a dream ! " said Evelina . " Yes . It was a dream . How can I tell you ? You will tell the person in my dream and then there will be trouble . " We were silent . My father said , " Mother , you must tell us what the spirits have shown you , and I forbid anyone to speak of this again ! " " It was a woman . She had come to our kraal . She was sitting by our fire , and she was laughing . I sat here and looked at her . Then I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of her mouth , it was ready to strike , and then it went back and it was hidden again . And still she was laughing . Then I saw that she had a womb and her time was come . I thought , ' I am the midwife , and I must help her . ' And quickly , all at once , she was delivered and there came out a black mamba , and as it was born it grew and grew , and I screamed . I would have run , but I could not . I knew it must kill us all . " Alice and Evelina began to wail " itlayiwe , rnayiwe , " until at last my father said : " Now then , shut up ! Who was this woman ? " " No , no ! I must n't tell you ! I am afraid ! " " Now then ! Tell us at once ! Who was she ? " " You make me say it , " said my mother , weeping . " It was Todini " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , but I knew she had changed his heart . At last my mother said quietly : " Have no fear , father ! You will be paid your debt when some other boy takes Todini to his kraal , but not Joseph . You can tell Shigodora that Joseph does not want Todini because he is throwing his hoe for some other girl . " " That would be best . But whom can he take ? " My mother turned to me . " Is there no other woman you would like , my son , now that you can not have Todini ? " " Yes . I would like to throw my hoe for Naomi Chakanetsa . She is beautiful . She is strong ; and I have seen her and given her a present . " My father was silent . Then he said : " All right . That will be best . We must lock up this dream in our hearts , and when some boy pays money for Todini perhaps I will help you a little bit with your wedding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must choose a good friend who will do it for him and talk to the girl 's father for him . So I went to see my friend Charlie Bumhiva , and he promised to help me . On Sunday night he came to find me . " Good evening , Charlie , " I said . " Good evening , Joseph . " " Have you spent the day well ? " " I have had a good day if you have . And I have been to Chakanetsa 's kraal . " " And then ? " " First I bathed and put on my holiday suit , and I took the hoe you gave me . " " Yes ? And then ? " " I came to Chakanetsa 's kraal , and all the people were inside the house . Puna , the mother of Naomi , had made beer and some friends had come to drink it . " " Yes ? " " I said ' Kwayiwayf and all the people said Kwayiwayil and I said : ' Are you quite well ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ! ' And Chakanetsa said : ' Come inside , Charlie , and taste my wife 's beer ! ' But I said : ' Here is a hoe . I have come to your kraal to throw it , ' and I dropped it at his feet . Then Chakanetsa picked it up and he said : ' Ah ! Whose is this hoe ? ' I said : It is the hoe of Joseph Nyakuno . " And why has he sent it to me ? ' So I pointed to Naomi , who was wearing the new dress you sent and the yellow duku . She stood with her arm round the neck of another girl and her face was hidden . ' It is because of your daughter . He likes her very much . " ' " Ah ! Very good ! And what did Chakanetsa say ? " " First he said nothing . Then he said : ' Taste our beer ! Then if you like you can come and see me to-morrow . ' So drank , and then we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next night Charlie came to see me again . " Good evening , Joseph , " he said . " Good evening , Charlie . " " Have you spent the day well ? " " I have had a good day if you have . I went to see Chakanetsa again . " " Ah , you saw him ? " " He said : ' I will keep this hoe , and Joseph can pay me five pounds mapsakiTaino . Then , after that we can talk about lobola . " " Ah , thank you , Charlie , thank you . I will find it as quick as I can . " When a man has thrown his hoe he must not see his girl again until he has paid mapsakiraino . It was ten days before I was able to draw out my money and send it by Charlie to Chakanetsa . Then I said : " Now , Charlie , let us go on Sunday to Chakanetsa 's kraal so that I can see my girl . " So on Sunday morning I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Charlie combed my hair for a long time , perhaps an hour . At last it looked very nice , with two partings and my hair on top like the comb of a cock . Then we bathed in the river . Then when we had eaten I caught the goat which I had bought for a present for Puna , the mother of Naomi , and tied a rope to him . We took our suitcases with our best clothes , and when we were near to Chakanetsa 's kraal we changed our clothes . I had a blue suit with a short coat and a tight waistcoat with a looking glass sewn on one pocket to shine in the sun , trousers that were tight at the top , so that my bottom looked big and round , and very wide at the feet , black and brown patent-leather shoes , very European and tight , a stiff collar under my chin , and a tie to fix on it . I had also an imitation wrist watch and a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles . Charlie looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I went to see Puna . " Kwaiwayi , Mbwuya , mwakadini ? ( Hail , mother-in-law , are you well ? ) . " I said . Puna did not smile because I had not yet given her a present , but she said : " Hail , I am well if you are . " " Mbwuya , I have brought you a goat to make you happy and some sugar ! " The goat was a good one . It cost meten shillings and it made Puna very happy and she laughed and called Naomi , and we sat together , and Charlie and I agreed to stay to eat with them . " We will have the goat to-night , " said Puna , ' ' for a flavoring for our porridge , and here is some beer that I have brewed . " So I took the goat away and killed him and Naomi cooked the porridge and grilled the meat and we had a great feast . Chakanetsa was very pleased because he had seen my money and he had talked to Charlie about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made many jokes about girls as heathen people do . As for me , I was very happy because I was with Naomi , but I wanted very much to talk to Charlie and to know how much I must pay for lobola and when we could marry . When we had eaten the goat and the porridge and finished the beer Naomi went outside to clean the pots . Soon I followed her . I whispered to her : " Naomi , let me come under your blanket to-night . " I loved her so much and I was drunk a little bit and did not mind that it was a fault for Christians to do like that before they are married in church . She said : " No , " but I knew in my heart that she was agreeing . Then Charlie came out . I think he was afraid I would do a bad thing . Charlie is a good Christian and he has no girl himself . " Joseph ! " he said . " You had better come home with me . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he said : " Listen , my friend ! If you take Naomi now Chakanetsa will say ' Yes ! All right ! You may have Naomi but you may not marry until you have paid twenty-five pounds lobola . ' Then you will have a fault for a long time and your children will not be christened . But if you make your heart strong and listen to me now , Chakanetsa will say : ' All right ! Joseph is a Christian and Naomi too . I must let them marry and Joseph can pay the lobola little by little afterward ! ' " Naomi began to cry , but she listened to Charlie and so I agreed . We went back into the house and told stories at the fire and then we went home . As soon as I could I paid Chakanetsa two pounds more and he agreed to let me marry as soon as I could get ready for it . Then I was very glad . I was careful to bring Puna a present each time I came to see Naomi so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to work every day at the European farm , but my family helped me to build a house . My mother brewed a lot of beer , and called all our people to come and drink . Then when they were happy Tsuro said : " Joseph , my son , is marrying Naomi . I must go now and build him a house . " All the people said : " That is very good . We must help you . " So the men took their axes and went away to cut trees and the women went to cut grass for the roof . When they came back my mother gave them more beer , and so all the people worked very quickly and well . When enough grass and wood was cut my family finished the work alone . My mother and my sisters and Naomi and Puna dug the earth and puddled it with water and mixed it with their feet , and my father and my uncle set up the timbers in a ring , binding them with stout withies tied with bark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass for thatch . Then the women plastered our house with mud , and made a smooth warm floor from cow dung mixed with water and sand . But it is very difficult to get married . If there is no fault , your girl wants you to buy her a veil and a white dress and gloves , and there is the beer and the meat and the Headman wants five shillings for going with you to the Native Commissioner for a certificate , and there is five shillings for the priest and money again for your girl when you marry , and all the time the girl 's father wants to know when you will pay him more lobola . Ah ! It is very difficult . My father helped me by giving me a fat ox , and I knew that my mother would make plenty of beer and that our guests would help us with porridge and more beer . So at last , a year after I had thrown my hoe , I went with the Headman andChakanetsa and Naomi to the Office for our certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to see my boss for leave off . I do not know why , but white men never want you to say : " Good morning ! Have you slept well ? " But instead they always speak to you quickly . He had gone indoors to drink tea and I stood outside with my hat in my hand and sometimes I coughed a little bit . When he had had tea he talked to the Missus and then he came outside , lighting his pipe . " Well , Jim ! What do you want ? " " I have made a plan to marry . " " Oh , you have ? How many wives have you already ? " I think this was a joke , but I do n't know why he talked like this , because I think my boss is a Christian . " Kweteb a ! No . I am not married , Boss ! " " All right ! When will this be ? " " I wanted Saturday . " " All right then ! Do n't /et your friends get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ! Bring me a bag of mealies and I will grind ' em for you free for a wedding present . All right , Jim ! " Alice and Evelina had built a fire and were busy making porridge . My mother and Puna were busy with the beer . Some more girls were carrying water , fetching firewood and laughing and talking . There were two more fires with cooking pots that we had borrowed and the ox was boiling . Charlie , my friend , was cutting and combing my hair , and 1 had a new black coat and gray trousers in my suitcase . We were all getting ready for my wedding . Charlie and I went to the river to bathe and then at last we all went to the church . There were very many people , Christians and heathen , come for the wedding , and we were all very happy . My mother had sent some more beer to the church and the people were beginning to laugh and sing and dance . Our priest had come riding on a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the people had seen the beer . Then Naomi came . When we marry it is unlucky for us to smile or laugh ; so she came in her white dress , walking very slowly in white shoes , with gloves pulled on her hands , and her veil and her flowers , but her head was held down and her face was solemn . Her maids followed her in new cotton dresses , and one of them held her new umbrella over her head . Her father , Chakanetsa , came dressed as always with his shirt and trousers , his spear held in his hand . So we all went into church , and I made my face very sad , though my heart was singing . In my pocket I could feel five shillings for the priest and the ring , which I had remembered to buy for sixpence . Then the priest smiled at us and put us in our places and began the prayers . 1Then the service was over Naomi and I walked out of the church arm-in-arm . All the people waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , looking sad , a girl holding Naomi 's umbrella over her head , and all the people shouted " Makorokoto , makorokoto ! " and came and touched our hands . Then the girls and young men danced and sang for us and the married women with their babies on their backs danced round and round us , whooping shrill and loud with their fingers playing on their lips . Sometimes a friend ran up with a handkerchief and flipped it up and down to make sure that there was no dust on us . And then a boy who has a camera came and took a photo . After that it was time to go to our kraal for the feast , and so Naomi said that she was tired and could not come with me , and I put my hand in my pocket and gave her threepence , and so she said she was all right , she would come . The boys and girls sang and danced in front of us and we walked slowly on , with all the other people following . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All newly married wives stop there , so I gave her threepence again . When we came to the river , all the midwives came to stopus and they said that we must not cross , because they had not had their present . So first of all I gave them two shillings each ; but they said no , that was not enough , our marriage would never be lucky , so then I gave them sixpence each and they clapped their hands and said : " Thank you ! " But there were eight of them and I think it cost me one pound . Then Naomi said she could not cross the river , she was frightened . So I gave her threepence more and my sister Alice helped her on to Evelina 's back , and I gave threepence to Naomi 's sister , a married woman called Elizabeth , and jumped on her back and we all crossed over . At last we got home . We had borrowed two chairs , and we sat down side by side outside our new house and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds because we did not know if there would be enough meat and porridge and beer to make all the people happy ; but we had to sit still on our chairs and look sad while all our friends sang and danced for us and laughed and made jokes to make us happy . By this time the sun had set and we were very hungry . We would have liked to go and sit at one of the fires and take some food from the pots with the others , but we had to go into our own house and sit down at a table which we had borrowed and have our food in there . When we had finished eating we took off our wedding clothes and put them away in suitcases and came outside again in ordinary clothes . Everybody was very happy now . We sat side by side while they sang and danced for us . Ahl It was a very good concert . The moon had passed the first quarter , but nobody wanted to go home until it had set . Some did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; for a man must not go under his wife 's blanket on the first night of his wedding . So now I am a man married and very happy . Naomi is my darling , and she is very strong to dig my garden and she cooks for me very well . And already she has a womb , so we are very happy .
