txt Enactment of the Chandler bill , even in a restricted form , to permit the readjustment of railroad capital structures without recourse to bankruptcy proceedings , appeared to be seriously endangered yesterday by a HouseSenate deadlock over its aorthea.tion . Members of the House judiciary committee have served notice that the bill , which has passed both chambers in widely divergent forms , will be permitted to die there unless the Senate will recede from its amendments which , in effect , would limit the application of the measure to the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Lehigh Valley railroads . Thus , even these two roads would fail to benefit apparently . Unless Representative Chandler ( Dem. , Tenn. ) succeeds in prevailing upon Chairman Wheeler ( Dem. , Mont. ) of the Senate interstate commerce committee to withdraw his objections to the Chandler version and permit a general application of the bill , it appears likely that it will simply remain in the House committee until Congress adjourns . Compromise Held Unlikely Mr. Chandler , author of the original measure , expects to confer with Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong position taken by Senator Wheeler and the other members of the Senate committee a compromise is unlikely . Chairman Wheeler has publicly stated that there is no justification for a general application of the adjustment procedure which would be provided by the abuse version . On the other hand , Representative Chandler said yesterday that the House committee feels the Senate amendments create inequities . Further , he said , the committee has " grave doubts " as to the constitutionality of the amendments insofar as they would deny relief on a like basis to all ' roads similarly situated . The Chandler bill was passed by the House in April and , after it had been drastically amended , by the Senate onMaj. ? 29 . Thereafter , instead of appointing the usual conference committee , the House referred the Senate measure to the judiciary committee as if it were an entirely new bill . The Senate amendment most in controversy would limit the benefits of the legislation to railroads : ( A ) not in equity receivership or in reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B ) which , prior to April 1 . 1939 , had prepared a. plan of adjustment for its capital structure and had the plan approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission . The effect of these provisions would be to limit the application of the measure to the only two roads which can meet the April 1 requirement  --  the Baltimore &; Ohio and the Lehigh Valley . The Chandler Bill The Chandler Bill , as passed by the House , was designed to permit any railroad , which is fundamentally sound . but handicapped by unnecessarily heavy capital structures , to enter into agreements with its creditors and security holders for the postponement or modification of ? ita obligations . Approval *if these agreements by both the Interstate Commerce Commission and the , bankruptcy courts would be required . The bill was drawn solely to aid roads in temporary financial difficulty . There are several other minor differences between the two bills which undoubtedly could be worked out in conference . But by limiting the application of the measure to those roads whose readjustment plans were approved by the ICC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler and the House committee feels la a fundamental change in the legislation .
