Beppo Miles ' duplex apartment in the Richelieu-Versailles apartment-hotel . At the right , an open door into a hallway that leads to the apartment-door ; in back , at the right , a door into the library , and at the left , a door into the dining-room ; at the left , a large window . There is a balcony above the doors in the back wall , with stairs coming down at the left : these lead to the upper floor of the duplex , which consists of two bedrooms with doors opening onto the balcony ; at the right , at the end of the balcony , is a door into an upper hall . The place is in process of being sumptuously done in the style of the Italian Renaissance : walls in Venetian blue , red brocades , high brocaded chairs , candelabra , etc . The left-hand wall , however , has not yet been decorated , and it remains bare and white . Left-center there is an old-fashioned American sofa with a high comb-scalloped back  --  a low table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A medley of ornaments and furniture : a tapestry between the two doors in the back wall and , in front of it , a small table with a drawer and a Mexican bank in the shape of a cow ; a great carved grandfather 's clock ; a painted screen ; a victrola ; a lamp of which the base is a green glass jar full of water ; a floor lamp behind the sofa in the shape of a bronze female nude , which holds up the bulbs and shade ; caricatures of Beppo and modern paintings ; modern ash-trays that stand on the floor . Some of the things have not been arranged yet but simply pushed over against the unstippled wall . Two telephones : an outside phone and a house phone . A Chinese boy with horn-rimmed glasses is filling a fancy cigarette box . The door-bell rings , and he goes out to answer it . He comes back with Beth Badger . CHANG I go and tell Mr. Miles you 're here . p. 3 He goes upstairs and knocks at the first door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle thirties , smartly dressed with the accent of a positive personality which is at the same time a little eccentric , stands looking around the room with swift sharp professional glances . At the sight of the nude wall , she smiles . Beppo Miles follows Chang downstairs . He is a man in his early forties , in a gaudy and luxurious dressing-gown . Chang goes into the dining-room . BETH Hello ! I just came in to see how the apartment was going ! ( She speaks rapidly , emphatically and loudly  --  nervous energy and nervous strain . ) BEPPO It 's all right as far as it 's gone . But you people have been holding out on me . Why in Heaven 's name do n't you finish it ? BETH Do you consider that screen " all right " ? It looks like one of those seascapes of Naples on the walls of Italian speakeasies ! BEPPO ( who has now descended the stairs and comes over and shakes hands with her ) . Well , it 's swell to see you !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( He goes to the dining-room door . ) Will you bring in the cocktails , Chang ? BETH Do you consider that lamp " all right " ? ( Pointing at the floor-lamp with the statue ) It looks like a fine old piece out of a high-class Saratoga gambling-house ! I suppose you think those Frank Lloyd Wright ash-trays strike an appropriate note ! You told us you wanted this room to impersonate the Italian Renaissance ! p. 4 BEPPO I do n't want to reproduce the Renaissance  --  I want a place that 's me . A touch of the gambling-house is all right ! BETH And a little touch of the Aquarium ! ( Indicating the water-jar lamp ) It 's a wonder you do n't keep gold-fish in that lamp . I never knew you had the soul of a Sixth Avenue auction room ! That Tiffany clock looks like one of those things that they hide the body in in mystery plays ! BEPPO Look , my dear : we 're not married anymore , so why not let me have things the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not to want to see your place look like hell . BEPPO If we ca n't be polite about each other 's tastes , what 's the use of being divorced ? BETH You know you trust my judgment  --  do n't be silly ! BEPPO My worst eye-sore here is that wall . When are you people going to finish the job ? BETH When we see a little remuneration for what we 've already done !  --  After all , I 've kept Ada Force from soaking you . You 're getting the whole thing for twenty thousand ! Chang has brought in the cocktails and puts the tray down on the little table in front of the sofa . Beppo sits on the sofa , Beth on the chair beside it . He pours out the drinks . BEPPO You 're just being bitches : you know that I 'll pay you ! I 've been terribly hard-up lately : I took an awful beating on the market . My General Tires has shrunk to about a sixth of its former dimensions , and since Art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pay the rent . But I 'm going to sign the best contract I ever had : I 'm going to be rolling in money ! p. 5 BETH What is it ? BEPPO A big syndicated feature in the Gibbs papers . Herman Godbrow Gibbs has been calling me up every day and telling me he 's got to have me  --  he says he 's got all the best talent but me . It 's a question of doing a daily strip with the same little tigers I did for Art and Fashion . Only they go around and look into conditions and tell people to cheer up  --  that the depression 's just a state of mind . BETH That 's hard on your little tigers  --  they always used to be furiously cynical ! BEPPO Well , they 've got to be optimistic now , and I 'm nothing if not optimistic . I 'm going to ask for thirty thousand . Then I 'll be able to pay you for the apartment and have Mimi finish at Miss French 's  --  and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss Europe last summer .  --  He 's a remarkable guy , this Gibbs ! He claims he can turn public opinion in a month , and when you think of all the people he reaches  --   --  BETH He 's just a riproaring ranting old bounder with a face like the rear end of a blue-behinded ape ! I sat next to him once at dinner and he tried to make me between the celery and the soup ! BEPPO I 've never met him  --  only talked to him on the phone . He has a Napoleon complex , I know  --  but then , he 's got a right to it , I suppose . He 's one of our conquerors in a sense . p. 6 BETH All right , if you can work for those creatures . I ca n't ! BEPPO How are you getting along with Ada Force ? BETH Rottenly ! BEPPO What 's the matter ? BETH Why , I do n't like it and I ca n't do it and I wo n't do it ! I 'm absolutely not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want to pose as Madame de Pompadour ! I ca n't kiss the rumps of people who order thirteenth-century Spanish refectories as ping-pong rooms on top of the Herschell Building ! When Mrs. Felix P. Hagenpecker comes to me and tells me she wants me to design her a boudoir in the spirit of the Seventh Plane of Yogi , I know I ought to smile very sweetly and equip her with the Chamber of Mirrors out of an old-time New Orleans bad-house  --  but what I do is simply say , Merde !  --  Ada is able to truckle to them because she has n't got an atom of taste herself  --  but it 's too much for Beth ! BEPPO It 's a good job , though : what do you care , if you can do what you want outside your work ? BETH I ca n't stand it  --  it drives me frantic . I 've discovered I 've got a mother-complex , and Ada brings it out ! BEPPO Have you been psyched ? p. 7 BETH I had a psychoanalytic beau  --  and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fear of my mother . That 's what keeps me under Ada Force 's thumb . I do n't think I ever told you what my mother was really like  --   --  BEPPO You always seemed immensely impressed by her . BETH ( with violence ) . Well , what she really was was a harsh  --  domineering  --  arrogant  --  nagging old harridan ! She brought me up in such deadly terror of her that I 've been cringing and wincing ever since . When anybody says anything the least bit sharp to me , I crumple up like a little scared child ! I 've been creeping and crawling before people all my life ! I go around Ada Force 's shop like a poor pitiful little whimpering whipped puppy !  --  the flabbyjowled money-goofy old horror ! BEPPO ( smiling ) . There 's no question about it , Beth , you 're the little shrinking violet of the world ! BETH Shut up ! It 's absolutely true !  --  And not only am I an abject coward  --  I 'm a miserable ignominious prude ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do any of the things Mama disapproved of  --   --  BEPPO Good Heavens , Beth  --  she must have been pretty advanced ! p. 8 BETH She was hideously Puritanical , and that 's the reason I 'm so brazen and exhibitionistic ! Every time I sleep with somebody or get blotto , I have to do it in a spirit of bravado !  --  I have to be saying all the time to Mama , " Look at this : you brutal old bluenose  --  I 'm going to be just as loose as I please ! " BEPPO I 've been getting psyched lately , myself  --  the doctor in the hotel here has been analyzing me . BETH You must be a rich subject ! BEPPO It 's really done a lot for me , I think . BETH I always used to tell you you were n't on to yourself . BEPPO I know it : as I look back now , I can see that what was wrong between us was really my sister-fixation . At home I 'd been an only son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister had done  --  wait on me and pay me homage  --  BETH You picked a poor partner for a homage-payer ! BEPPO I 'd been utterly dependent on my sister , and no other eligible girl had ever been able to get me away from her , and the result was I 'd go out for my fun with the little floozies of the town . So that when I was married to Mimi 's mother and afterwards to you , I developed a sort of incest-taboo about you and took to going out with the floozies in Paris just the way I 'd done back in Galesburg. p. 9 BETH That floozy who finally grabbed you off would certainly have been right in her setting in any small-town drug-store ! BEPPO Well , you see I was trying desperately to get away from my sibling-relation with you . BETH You got royally rolled , I hear . BEPPO Rolled and rooked and reamed . That 's the only time in my life I was ever left stranded by a woman with no money to pay the hotel bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's your inappeasable appetite for chi-chi . BEPPO Well , I think I 've come to terms with my sister-complex . I 've finally discovered somebody who combines the sister with the floozy . BETH Who is she ? BEPPO Nobody at all  --  a little girl who plays the piano in the Purple Hour night-club . But she 's a darling  --  she gives me something that I 've never had from any other woman . BETH What is it ?  --  unqualified admiration ? BEPPO No : she 's really less interested in me than a more sophisticated person might be  --   --  BETH Beppo , you 're still one of the world 's most price-less people ! p. 10 BEPPO ( paying no attention ) . But she 's so simple and natural and sweet ! You feel with a person like that that you 've gotten back to something basic that the modern woman has lost ! BETH Big behinds ? BEPPO No : on the contrary , she 's slim . But she 's a natural woman , that 's all ! ( Becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no education at all , but she 's never for a moment cheap . It 's because she 's got Europe so close behind her  --  her people were Polish peasants . BETH Is that Europe ? BEPPO She has n't been New-Yorkized yet . You know there 's something in me that still goes back to the West and that makes me like natural homely things .  --  I 'm going to try to hook up that feeling with the faith in American business  --  in this series I 'm doing for Gibbs . BETH Beppo , you 're a riot ! I suppose it was your great love of simplicity that inspired this sumptuous Florentine catch-all ! BEPPO I 'm complex  --  that 's what makes me interesting . BETH You ought to get yourself disentangled . Find out what your real need is and then make yourself damn well accept it . That 's what I 'm doing . p. 11 BEPPO What do you mean ? BETH I 'm stalking an Englishman ! BEPPO Really ? BETH A splendid simple clean-limbed Englishman ! BEPPO Marvelous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to keep taking me out and telling me about his place in Herts  --  which needs a mistress , he says . He keeps saying I 'm not at all like an American and that I 'd be very much at home in England . I would n't be hard to persuade ! BEPPO That 's splendid . BETH I 've always been weak as water where English-men were concerned . My father cme from Boston , you know , and anyone with an English accent has always been able to fascinate me . Papa had a big place on Long Island till Mama drove him insane , and we had to go and live in a boarding-house . And a big English country-house has always been my favorite fantasy ! BEPPO What 's your Englishman up to over here ? BETH Making business connections , as he says . Trying to be a business man , poor dear !  --  He 's got the loveliest English buck-teeth ! BEPPO It 's not a chap named Horseley Longbroke , is it ? p. 12 BETH Do you know him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , he 's coming to dinner .  --  I guess that country place of his is in pretty bad condition , though . BETH I know ; but he makes you feel that you could n't have a nobler aim than to restore it to its original grandeur  --  that the fate of the British Empire depends on getting the roof mended and seeing that the garden is right  --  and in a sense it does , of course ! I 'd much rather help a decent Englishman put his ancestral house in order than to butter up a lot of old tarts who think they want to be interior-decorated ! BEPPO You always were a snob , Beth .  --  Well , my dear , I wish you luck ! The telephone rings , and Chang , who has just come in with clean ash-trays , answers it at once . BEPPO ( apprehensively ) . That 's not Mr. Gibbs , is it ? CHANG ( at the phone ) . All right . I tell him . ( Hanging up the receiver , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that she and Mr. Salzburg ca n't come tonight . Mr. Salzburg has collapsed . BEPPO Collapsed ? What was the matter ? p. 13 CHANG She did n't say : she only said that Mr. Salzburg had collapsed . BEPPO ( to Beth ) . I suppose that 's the penalty of being a broker . Chang goes out . BETH I think it 's his wife , too . BEPPO Does she cheat on him ? BETH No , but she 'd like to  --  so that she 's probably harder to live with than if she did . She kept going to the trial of that woman who murdered her husband in the bath-tub , and then she 'd come back home , he told me , and hypnotize a little pet alligator . The alligator got limp and died ! BEPPO Look , Beth : why do n't you come to dinner ?  --  since your friend Longbroke 's going to be here  --   --  BETH I 'd be charmed to ! Will I have time to go and dress ? BEPPO Yes , lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Godbrow Gibbs , if you do n't mind that  --  I thought it would be a good idea to get him on my own ground instead of trying to cope with him on his . He insists on having my decision tonight . BETH Very sagacious , no doubt ! BEPPO And Chet and Charlotte are coming  --  you do n't mind seeing Chet , do you ? p. 14 BETH No , of course not  --  I do n't mind any of my old husbands . Chet and I see more of one another nowadays than we used to when we were married and went out to parties separately . BEPPO  --  And my little girl-friend , June . BETH What fun ! Your little night-club buttercup ? BEPPO I want you to tell me what you think of her . BETH All right , I will , my dear ! She kisses him . BEPPO It 's swell to see you , old thing  --  I see you so little nowadays . BETH I do n't know whether it 's really safe to meet a prospective fianc in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and Chet to give me a good character with Horseley . Try and convince him , will you , that the only thing that ever was wrong with me was that I did n't have a country house ! BEPPO I 'll make love to you , as if I regretted you . BETH You do n't need to go so far as that . BEPPO Maybe I do regret you ! It seemed for a moment just now as if we were back in Paris arranging to have people in . BETH Usually followed by ghastly rows after the people had left ! p. 15 BEPPO Still , it was fun for a while . BETH For a little while .  --  Well , I must leap ! I 'll change and be back in a jiffy ! BEPPO ( going out with her into the hall ) . Do n't rush  --  you 've got plenty of time  --   --  Chang comes back for the cocktail tray . Beppo , after seeing Beth out , returns , reading the paper , which he has picked up outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , well . Chang  --  what 's the world coming to ? CHANG The capitalist system today is entering its final phase . The contradictions inherent in capitalism have resulted in a general crisis . BEPPO ( looking up ) . You talk like a radical , Chang ! CHANG I am a member of the Young Communist League . BEPPO That 's interesting . I knew you were a student , but I did n't know you went in for Communism . CHANG A Chinese student who is able to think must inevitably become a Communist . BEPPO Are there many Chinese Communists ? CHANG In China a great many , yes . In the capitalist press they call them bandits. p. 16 BEPPO You say " contradictions in capitalism . " What do you mean by that ? CHANG It is inevitable that under the competitive system , which prevails in the capitalist countries , there must continually take place a seeking for cheaper methods of production . This stimulates increased efficiency ; and the more completely is industry rationalized , the fewer workers are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse can people consume . This is a contradiction . BEPPO What then ? CHANG The capitalist system today has accomplished its historical function . The system of ownership by the few gives rise to its opposite , Communism , and the dispossessed proletariat takes over the means of production and the government . BEPPO God forbid ! The present government is bad enough !  --  No , Chang ; the general run of humanity are no more fit to govern than they are to do anything else that calls for imagination or intellect  --   --  CHANG It is clear that you do not understand the basic class nature of government  --   --  BEPPO I do n't believe in that kind of classes , Chang  --  I recognize only two classes : the vast undistinguished mass and the small civilized minority , and we of the civilized minority have no concern whatever with politics . Politics is a dirty game  --  amusing , if you like low comedy , but not a thing in which a civilized person can take the faintest interest . p. 17 CHANG Bourgeois politics is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy : how dreadful to hear you spouting that jargon ! You Chinese are probably the most civilized people left in the whole world !  --  You 've got centuries of philosophical serenity behind you ! CHANG The mandarins in China  --  the civilized minority , as you call them  --  have betrayed the Chinese masses to foreign capital  --   --  BEPPO But what have you got to do with the masses ?  --  You 're a mandarin yourself , Chang  --  you know it !  --  Contemplate the world and laugh ! To understand is to laugh ! CHANG The class-conscious Chinese student does not study to be a mandarin . BEPPO But that will never do ! We must have mandarins !  --  otherwise where would we get mandarin coats ? They 'd have nothing to hang on the walls in Hollywood !  --  There 'll be eight for dinner , after all , Chang . You 'd better make fresh cocktails . Chang picks up the cocktail tray and goes back into the dining-room . Beppo looks after him a moment . Mimi appears from her room on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over eighteen , very pretty and smart . She seems remarkably mature for her age  --  her manners are formal and self-assured , and she gives an impression of great sophistication . She is wearing an evening gown with a very low V-shaped back . BEPPO That 's a very snappy gown , my dear  --  I have n't seen it before . p. 18 MIMI I know : I only got it yesterday . I 'd really been economizing up to then , but I thought that as Mr. Herman Godbrow Gibbs was coming so nobly to the rescue  --   --  BEPPO We must get the apartment finished first , though . MIMI Yes , I know . Not another stitch ! BEPPO It 's a great success , however . You look like the back pages of Art and Fashion . He kisses her . MIMI You do n't mind , do you , Dad , if I go out after dinner tonight ? BEPPO ( evidently disappointed ) . I like to have you here to be hostess , you know . You 're the only hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really proper for a young gal like me to be hostess at an older people 's party like this . BEPPO You do it beautifully , my dear . You never take them out of their depth . MIMI But I think it cramps their style . BEPPO On the contrary , it brightens them up ! MIMI This is my last night before I go back to school , and I wanted to snatch a few last moments of whoopee . p. 19 BEPPO Who are you going out with ? MIMI Jack Payne . BEPPO Good heavens , Mimi ! Again ? That fellow is a frightful phony ! MIMI I know you do n't like him , Dad , and he does have his untutored side , but he 's really awfully sweet . BEPPO What does he do ? MIMI He owns restaurants and things . BEPPO He 's just an ordinary Broadway heel . MIMI He 's not : he 's perfectly swell ! BEPPO I hate to have you seen with him , Mimi . Remember that , after all , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffy or snooty about it , but  --   --  MIMI You 've told me yourself , Dad , that anybody who had real social self-confidence could feel free to do anything they pleased . BEPPO I know : but it 's a different matter to have a man like that for a regular beau .  --  You 've hardly been seeing anybody else . MIMI I like him : Jack 's a darling . BEPPO But you must n't take him seriously . MIMI Why not ? He 's serious about me. p. 20 BEPPO Because I want you to do better with life than that . You 're my only child , Mimi  --  you 're the only thing I 've gotten out of three marriages . MIMI I know . BEPPO I want you to be somebody and something . You have practically the whole world to choose from . When you and I travel together , we manage to meet all the smart people  --  all the swells and all the geniuses . And living the way we do , we can take our ease and watch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've watched them , and I feel very seriously that Jack is the outstanding applicant . BEPPO But he 's cheap , my dear  --  he 's cheap ! You do n't like people who are cheap . Do n't you remember how you used to feel about that Belgian automobile salesman who gave you such a rush at Antibes ?  --  the man we used to laugh about so ? Well , Jack Payne is just like that , only worse ! MIMI He 's not a bit like that perfect jackass  --  he 's really an awfully exciting person ! BEPPO That sounds like your mother , Mimi . She always used to be trying to tell me that all the terrible people in the Village were gifted or exciting or something . It was generous and charming of her , but I do n't want you to accept her scale of values .  --  p. 21 MIMI I spend six months of the year with her , Dad ! BEPPO I 've tried to give you certain things that would offset the Green Tiger tea-room . MIMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . MIMI Some people think they used to be better . BEPPO Well , Mimi , you ca n't have everything . If you go in for the kind of thing that the Greenwich Village people make such a fuss about  --  or used to make such a fuss about : they do n't do anything down there any more  --  if you go in for working for little magazines that never pay you anything and that nobody ever reads anyway , you have to forego a lot of other things . And what you have to do without is practically everything that makes life worth living  --  comfort , amusements , good manners , the whole of real civilized existence . I 've wanted you to have all that  --   --  MIMI I know . BEPPO And that 's why I hate to see you fall for a man who ca n't give you the real thing . MIMI You have your own weak moments , Dad . What about your little night-club hostess ? p. 22 BEPPO June Macy 's a fine person . She 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to hurt your feelings , Dad , but , although she 's awfully sweet , I really do n't think she 's so marvelous . You know yourself that some of your friends are a little on the dese-dose-and-dem side . BEPPO Let me tell you , my dear : it 's all right when you 're in your own house to have anybody in that interests you , and anybody interests me who 's amusing or good-looking or has brains  --   --  MIMI Jack 's certainly good-looking and amusing , and if it 's a question of having brains , he 's certainly in the running with June Macy ! BEPPO Just a moment , my dear : I was going to say that someday , when you 're mistress in your own house , you can entertain anyone you please , but that knocking around in night-clubs with the dregs of the underworld  --   --  MIMI Please do n't rave like that , Dad  --  it sounds as if you had a daughter-complex ! BEPPO I do n't see enough of my daughter nowadays to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do anything about it anyway because I 've promised Jack I 'd go tonight , and he 's coming for me after dinner . ( She looks at the clock . ) Dad , you must rush ! It 's 7:30  --  they 'll be coming any minute ! p. 23 Beppo looks at the clock and gets up and starts for the stairs . BEPPO ( with suppressed anger ) . Well , take him out when he comes  --  I do n't want you to ask people to meet him ! He goes upstairs . Mimi shoots a look after him . The door-bell rings : Beppo hastens his pace , stumbling over the top step . Chang goes to the door . Mimi gives a few touches to her hair and dress . ( The door-bell is loud and piercing : a continually recurring motif that interrupts whatever is going on and finally gets on the nerves . ) Chet and Charlotte Chives come in . Chet is a nice little man , sensitive and , in manner , nave ; Charlotte is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him from slipping her leash . Chet wears a dinner-jacket . MIMI Hello ! ( She shakes hands with them . ) Dad 'll be right down . CHET You look s-stunning in that gown , Mimi . It g-goes anything I 've seen one better ! CHARLOTTE ( laughing easily but a little coldly ) . I 've had one exactly like it all winter and you 've never noticed it at all ! MIMI They 're certainly no great novelty  --  everybody has them this year , I think . ( As Chang comes back from the hall ) Will you bring the cocktails , Chang ? p. 24 CHARLOTTE You 're not still home on your vacation , are you , Mimi ? MIMI This is my last day . Back to the books tomorrow ! CHARLOTTE ( snubbingly  --  since Chet is plainly delighted with Mimi ) . It seems to me that the schools give frightfully long vacations nowadays . ( With a patronizing smile )  --  Not too long for you , though , I dare say . MIMI I do n't like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leprous then . Chang brings in the cocktails and hors d ' uvre and passes them around  --  then goes out . The cocktails have been made with orange-juice and are served in small goblets . CHET ( taking a cocktail and beaming with decorous rakishness  --  he is already a little tight  --  while Charlotte stares about the room ) . You do n't think that at all ! You think that everything 's swell ! It may be leprous to us but it is n't leprous to you ! CHARLOTTE ( interrupting ) . This room is quite impressive . MIMI Do n't look at the blank wall ! CHET It sets off the view  --  it 's a good idea ! ( He goes over to the window and looks out . ) Well , there it is  --  that old devil city ! You can see the whole Park from here , ca n't you ? p. 25 MIMI I always think the motor-roads from here look just like a big boa-constrictor trying to choke the trees and the grass . CHET That  --  that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bleak and abstract .  --  And the people are drearier than ever this year ! The New Yorkers have faces nowadays that seem actually boarded up !  --  it 's as if the sky or something were shutting down on them  --  CHARLOTTE ( behind them , breaking in ) . The landlords and banks are shutting down on them ! CHET  --  It 's as if people were realizing for the first time that the city is really a prison  --  though I d-do n't know whether they 're even so human as that  --  they 're more like a lot of little bugs that have just had the light turned out on them  --  they 're still moving around in the darkness , waiting for it to flash on again so that they can keep on flying against it .  --  I 've never known New York so ominous ! Everything seems actually darker ! CHARLOTTE Everything is darker : they 're economizing on electric signs . CHET Of course ! I had n't thought of that !  --  ( Turning away from the window ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright !  --  the ladies in gorgeous new gowns , the caviar glittering on the crackers , the cocktails blooming like a bed of yellow tulips ! p. 26 CHARLOTTE You must have snitched a drink before you came . CHET Of c-course I had a drink before I came ! One always ought to have at least two drinks before going out anywhere : it 's a social obligation !  --  What a dandy little Mexican cow ! ( He picks it up and rattles it . ) Some money in it , too ! I ought to contribute my bit ! ( He puts a penny in . ) Beppo , while Charlotte and Chet have been speaking , has hurried out of his room , straightening his tie , and now is on his way downstairs . He is wearing a deep-purple dress-suit . BEPPO Thanks , Chet ! That 's a fund for collapsed financiers . CHET Hello ! BEPPO I think that we artists nowadays can afford to give them a helping hand . ( Arriving at the bottom of the stairs and shaking hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( To Chet ) Hello ! CHARLOTTE You know , Beppo , I do n't think this apartment is half so bad as people say . BEPPO It 's slightly incomplete as yet , but I decided to give a party in it anyway ! CHET It 's s-swell ! That b-blank wall would be fine to draw pictures on ! p. 27 The door-bell rings , and Beppo glances apprehensively toward the door . A moment 's silence . BEPPO ( catching sight of the new arrival ) . It 's Longbroke . You know Horseley Longbroke , do n't you ? CHARLOTTE Yes , indeed : he 's such a delightful man . CHET A real bit of old England . BEPPO The stuff that stopped the Spanish Armada ! Horseley Longbroke comes in : beautifully tailored , buckteeth , no expression . LONGBROKE ( shaking hands and grinning in what he believes to be the American manner ) . Well , folks , this is so swell ! BEPPO Delighted to see you , Duke ! LONGBROKE It 's such a kick to see you all ! CHARLOTTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Longbroke , is one of the most remarkable feats I 've ever witnessed . LONGBROKE One picks it up quite naturally . BEPPO ( handing him a cocktail ) . It 's a pity to spoil English English though . LONGBROKE American 's a different language , I think . p. 28 BEPPO Like everything else in God 's country , it was designed for business , not beauty .  --  You 're Oxford , are n't you ? LONGBROKE No : Cambridge .  --  I think it 's admirable for business letters , American . CHARLOTTE They have n't begun giving business courses at Oxford and Cambridge yet , have they ? LONGBROKE Not yet ; but it would be an excellent thing , I think . The educational system in England is quite antiquated  --  except in the technical schools . It does n't fit one for the modern world at all . CHARLOTTE Oh , I think it would be too dreadful to have business courses at Cambridge ! BEPPO The beauty of the English system is that everything is purely gratuitous . In America we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the men who go to English universities do n't have to worry about results . I think that one of the most perfectly delightful and most perfectly satisfying jobs in the world must be that of an English don ! LONGBROKE A don does n't get much of a screw , you know  --  about 500 only . BEPPO But he has the good life ! CHARLOTTE To live at Cambridge would be enough ! p. 29 LONGBROKE Of course there 's a sort of chap who enjoys that sort of life . I ca n't say I should , though . CHET I 've always thought being a Liberal member of parliament must be the most perfect job in the world ! LONGBROKE On the contrary , an M.P . does even less well than a don  --  four hundred is all they get  --  and they 're taking a cut with the new government . One really has to have private means for Parliament . BEPPO America 's corrupting you , Longbroke ! LONGBROKE What do you mean ? BEPPO You 're learning to look at everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Beppo is speaking , and , glancing expectantly in that direction , he lowers his voice on his last words at the thought of Mr. Gibbs . LONGBROKE Money ? It seems to me Americans are perfectly dizzy about money ! To an Englishman it seems as if Americans did n't take money seriously at all ! June Macy comes in  --  very pretty , simple and quiet . BEPPO ( hailing her with evident enthusiasm ) . Well , Beautiful !  --  You look pretty as a picture , as we used to say back in Galesburg !  --  This is Mrs. Chives  --  and Mr. Longbroke  --  and Mr. Chives . Miss June Macy of the Purple Hour . p. 30 June shakes hands with Charlotte , but merely bows and smiles to the others . She is shy  --  follows everything that is said , but stands aside from the conversation . Mimi , however , comes over and shakes hands with her . JUNE ( to Mimi ) . Hello ! BEPPO I suppose it 's no use offering you a cocktail . JUNE ( smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been talking to Mimi but now turns his attention to June ) . You 're not f-fighting high b-blood pressure like so many people , are you ? JUNE It 's the figure : I get fat awfully easy . CHET You 're absolutely right !  --  because you 've got a figure that 's worth keeping . JUNE Thanks ! CHET I 've studied anatomy  --  that makes me a judge . You 've got an unusually lovely figure ! JUNE Thank you ! CHET Are you a dancer ? JUNE No : I just play the piano . CHET You never do any posing , do you ? I 'm a painter , and I 'll be needing a model soon . p. 31 CHARLOTTE ( cutting firmly in ) . Look at these Periwinko skeletons , Chet . I could n't see them at all in Paris , but I think these are quite swell . CHET Periwinko 's skeletons have no figures !  --  Now if we could only c-combine what Periwinko 's skeletons have with what Miss Macy has , we might get a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CHARLOTTE You 're always " if-only " - ing , Chet ! They turn toward the pictures and talk , Chet continuing to pay court to June . LONGBROKE ( to Beppo ) . What a jolly apartment this is ! BEPPO It was done by Beth Badger . I think you know her . LONGBROKE Oh , really ? Yes , I do know her quite well . BEPPO She 's coming to dinner tonight . LONGBROKE How jolly !  --  how swell !  --  I knew she did interior-decorating but I 'd never seen any of her work . She 's done you quite splendidly , I think ! ( He looks around . ) The door-bell rings . Chang goes . BEPPO That 's probably Beth now . LONGBROKE I suppose interior-decorating is a very profitable line , is n't it ? p. 32 BEPPO ( after a moment 's hesitation ) . Yes , in general , it is  --   --  Beth bursts in , in an evening gown  --  louder and more animated than before , from the nervous excitement of hurrying . BETH Hello ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chives ! ( To Beppo ) Back in a different costume ! I hope you have n't been waiting for me and cursing me ! BEPPO Not at all : you 've made marvelous time ! This is Miss Macy . BETH How do you do ! BEPPO I believe you know Mr. Longbroke . BETH Why , Horseley  --  bless your heart ! I had n't expected to see you tonight ! BEPPO ( to Chet and Charlotte ) . Jeff Salzburg has had a breakdown  --  did you know it ?  --  they could n't come tonight . ( Handing Beth a cocktail ) Fasten onto this , Beth . CHET Really ? No , I did n't know . That 's a d-damn shame ! CHARLOTTE You heard about poor Willa Sprague ? BETH Yes : I 've felt as if a prop had been knocked out from under me ! p. 33 BEPPO I never expected her to crack ! CHARLOTTE I do n't know . Had you seen her lately ? She 'd been behaving very strangely . CHET She really had a talking neurosis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century in France . CHARLOTTE You could n't stop her once she got started ! BEPPO What was really the matter , do you think ? CHARLOTTE Roy Milton . She was mad about him . CHET And he was mad , but not about her . CHARLOTTE He 's not interested in anything but parrots . BETH He says that his parrots have come between him and every woman who ever loved him . CHARLOTTE I understand that the parrots took to squawking about the seventeenth century . CHET They 'd heard her at Roy 's so much that they began saying " Louis Quatorze . " BETH And that 's all that 's left of poor Willa ! BEPPO Well , I for one intend to survive intact ! At this moment I feel like a million dollars , and I hope to live to be worth it ! ( He takes a drink. ) p. 34 CHET If you had it , you might n't feel so well . I think people are much better off bankrupt ! CHARLOTTE That 's all right for you to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if I went bankrupt ? CHET They 're much more agreeable , anyway . They ca n't afford to be so snooty . CHARLOTTE You and I would n't be more agreeable if Voorhies Valves should shut up shop , and we had to live somewhere in a couple of rooms ! BETH You 're perfectly right , Charlotte , when Chet and I tried to live together in a studio walk-up on Eighth Street , he used to snap and snarl like a pet chow !  --  I 've been married to two of these gents , Horseley : both Beppo and Chet Chives are former husbands of mine ! LONGBROKE I see . CHET Well , I s-still insist that the hard times here m-made people much more human ! BEPPO Yes , there 's no question that the depression 's a splendid thing and does you no end of good , if only you do n't die of it first . CHET Well , h-here 's to life ! BEPPO Righto ! Here 's to life ! CHET This is r-really the best hour of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that anything may happen after 5 ! p. 35 BETH It usually does with you  --  you get pie-eyed ! CHET After 5 , the fixed pattern of the day breaks up ! Everything dissolves for a while ! The soul comes out and unfolds itself  --  it floats above your head like an ectoplasm ! BEPPO And then you realize the next morning that it 's a mongoose that lives on the ceiling ! I do n't know what it is about that mongoose but he always makes me feel damned uncomfortable ! He 's never done anything savage  --  just darts around on the ceiling , but I hate to have him get behind me ! BETH Elsie Peters used to put out milk for foxes . MIMI Jack Payne says that once he had three little owls that roosted in his mouth for a week . He said they were awfully little and he did n't mind having them there till they tried to bring home a house-guest . BETH ( to Longbroke ) . Are you haunted by those creatures in London as much as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so grimly . BETH You drink in a civilized fashion ! BEPPO They ought to have some kind of apparatus like the machine that registers earthquakes , which would record the degrees of heeby-jeebies in the principal cities of the world ! p. 36 BETH Wally Ford tried going on the wagon for a month , but he says it makes almost no difference ! BEPPO Well , that being so , ladies and gentlemen , let me offer you another cocktail ! Say what you like : here we are at the moment , on the whole very agreeable people and doing on the whole very well ! The world , we all know it , is tragic , it 's terrible  --  but that 's no reason we should n't enjoy our cocktail ! We 're not responsible for God 's blunders , and we may as well get what fun out of them we can . It may be that laughter , after all , is our only compensation in this Vale of Tears ! For us people to laugh among ourselves , perhaps that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm of the few ! here 's to the glamor of the moment ! So long as they hold out , let the world be what it may ! The door-bell rings violently . BEPPO That must be Gibbs at last ! He busies himself with filling the glasses while Chang goes to the door . A moment 's silence . A loud voice is heard outside . THE VOICE What 's the name of the people who live here ?  --  Miles ? Ah , yes , Miles ! Is Mr. Miles at home ? A man of about fifty , outdistancing Chang , comes in . He is fattish but flaccid-looking , his eyes , which have pouches and heavy rings , somewhat wildly staring . He is arrayed in a magnificent dress-suit . BEPPO ( shaking hands with him ) . How do you do , Mr. Gibbs ! p. 37 BOSTOCK Mr. Miles , I believe ! BEPPO This is Mrs. Chives , Miss Macy , Miss Badger , my daughter , Mr. Longbroke , Mr. Chives . BOSTOCK Most happy , Miss Childs , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cocktail , Mr. Gibbs ? ( Offering him one ) BOSTOCK No , thank you ! My name is not Gibbs , by the way : it 's Bostock  --  Luke Bostock ! BEPPO Ah , you 're the owner of the building  --  the owner of the Richelieu-Versailles ! BOSTOCK I am , and I 'm your neighbor across the hall . I hope you will forgive this intrusion  --  if I 'm a nuisance , boot me out !  --  but I was all by myself tonight  --  all dressed up and no place to celebrate  --  and I thought maybe you would n't mind if I dropped in in a neighborly fashion  --  BEPPO  --  Not at all  --  very glad to know you . Sit down , wo n't you ? BOSTOCK Thank you ! He does so . BEPPO Sure you wo n't have a drink ? BOSTOCK Do n't use it , thanks ! No , I just want to see people , I want to see people just like you  --  gay , smart , good-looking people ! I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a malaise tonight  --  you know what I mean , a malaise , a feeling like all was not well  --  I do n't know whether any of you people have ever felt anything like that ? p. 38 BEPPO ( smiling ) . A little touch now and then . CHET We know what you mean perfectly . BOSTOCK Well , you 'll understand the situation then . My dinner engagement had been called off , and my valet was out for the evening , and there I was all alone  --  and then this malaise set in . But when you get among nice people you know that it was all just a mood ! BEPPO Yes , we have our moods , too . BOSTOCK But it 's not the fault of the place ! BEPPO This apartment , you mean ? BOSTOCK The hotel  --  the Richelieu-Versailles ! If the hotel was n't attractive , it would n't matter what you did to the apartment ! It is n't the individual home nowadays  --  it 's the apartment house , the hotel ! What the building is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I made this place cheerful yet restful  --  sparkling yet comfort-conscious ! BEPPO I 've found it delightful here . BOSTOCK I wonder if you 've ever heard the story of how I came to build the Richelieu-Versailles ? BEPPO No , I do n't think so .  --  How did it happen ? BOSTOCK ( with genial enthusiasm , not drunken  --  he is lucie and cogent in his fashion , has none of the sloppiness of drunkenness  --  but pitched beyond the normal key : as he goes on , Beth , unseen by Bostock , makes the gesture of sniffing cocaine for the benefit of the people near her ) . It 's really a rather thrilling story  --  rather picturesque , I think ! A triumph of American democracy of the real old-fashioned brand ! It was 1918 : the War ! I was a doughboy , a non-com truck-driver just down from the Argonne Forest . I went to the Ritz in Paris , and I asked the room-clerk for a room . I was a doughboy  --  I was uncouth and dusty  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plastered with mud . I asked for a room at the Ritz , and what do you think I got ? The razz !  --  I was turned away ! The clerk told me all the rooms were taken . A goddam lie , of course !  --  In a second I had that clerk by the throat and I was shaking him like a terrier shakes a rat ! ( Leaping up and illustrating on Beppo ) I said , " You little weasel-faced frog ! " I said . " You may not be aware of it , but I 've got a hell of a big belch about you French !  --  a hell of a big belch ! We come over here and bust our boilers , " I said , " to save the sacred soil of France !  --  we get ourselves shot up and blown up , " I said . " We sleep in the world 's lousiest billets  --  And it 's , Ah , nos braves all is ! ' est vous qui nous avez sauvs ! " ( To Beppo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that ?  --  " But then when you try to put up at a high-class hotel in Paris , " I said , " it seems there are n't any rooms ! Well , I want to tell you something , " I said , " and I do n't want you ever to forget it ! I wo n't be out of this man 's army five years before I 'll have a hotel of my own that 'll make this dump look like a back-house ! "  --  I 'm sorry to be vulgar , ladies ! ( With tremendous smiling deference ) But I was frankly indignant !  --  And I kept my word and here 's the place ! p. 39 BETH What a magnificent story , Mr. Bostock ! CHARLOTTE But why call it the Richelieu-Versailles if you 've got such a hate on the French ? BOSTOCK It was the Ritziest name I could think of  --  Ritzier than the Ritz .  --  But how did I do it , you 're wondering . By vision and by the readiness to take risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I understood the building game . I knew a land speculator in the Bronx , and I got him to let me have a $10,000 plot of land for $20,000 . He lent me $2,000 to start with  --   --  BEPPO It seems to me you lost on that deal . Do you mean to say you paid $20,000 for a $10,000 piece of land ? BOSTOCK Not a penny ever changed hands except the $2,000 he gave me.  --  All he got was a mortgage for twenty-two thousand on the building I was going to erect  --  the dream erection of my vision . CHARLOTTE But what did the land speculator get out of it ? BOSTOCK He used the mortgage as security to borrow fourteen thousand from a savings bank , and I went to a title company and borrowed a hundred and twenty thousand  --   --  so that everybody made on the deal .  --  With the money I put up a building worth a hundred and eighty thousand . p. 40 CHARLOTTE But how did you pay the contractors ? BOSTOCK That 's just what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe you think I was bankrupt . If I 'd been a goddam frog , I would have been . But I was a Connecticut Yankee  --  a Yankee from Stamford , Conn. !  --  and I went out and I got me a bigger plot of ground in a more desirable neighborhood on the same kind of terms as the first !  --  I do n't want to bore you with this ! Are all these details boring you ! BETH This part is a tiny bit technical . BOSTOCK I just wanted you to know how I did it !  --  it 's really a breath-taking story ! The romance of American business ! there 's nothing to beat it in the world !  --  I went to this second land-gambler , and I got him to loan me money the same as the first one did , and I borrowed half a million from the title company . Then I paid the contractors their sixty thousand , so my credit was good again , and they were tickled to death to let me owe them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was I bankrupt then ? No ! I climaxed in the Richelieu-Versailles  --  I was able to borrow enough money then to put up the Emperor hotel of Manhattan : a million-dollar palace without a penny of my own invested ! CHARLOTTE You owe a million dollars , so that makes you a millionaire ! p. 41 BEPPO But what do the contractors do now ? BOSTOCK They pass the costs on to the manufacturers . BEPPO But what happens then ? What do they do ? CHARLOTTE I 'll tell you what happens then ! My family makes bathroom fixtures . What happens then is everybody goes bust ! BETH ( to Longbroke ) . You chose rather an unpropitious moment to come over here to make your fortune ! LONGBROKE So it seems . BOSTOCK Nothing in it ! Do n't believe a word of it ! This country 's as sound as it ever was ! It 's going to be better than it ever was ! Just to show you how optimistic I 'm feeling : I 'm having the dining-room here enlarged and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes and cut the kitchen staff down two-thirds ! JUNE And they 'll be eating in soup-kitchens , huh ? BOSTOCK That shows you how I 'm counting on prosperity !  --  And here we are in the meantime in the glamorous Richelieu-Versailles  --  a great hotel for a great metropolis ! I do n't want to bore you , but silly as it seems , I 'm a nut about my own hotel ! It 's just the very palace I dreamt of when I was throttling that room-clerk at the Ritz ! In the Richelieu-Versailles , you dress for the Aubusson Room or you 're not allowed to enter . My roomclerks are all college men , and if they do n't happen to like your looks , you wo n't be able to register if you 're the French ambassador himself ! The carpets are so soft in the lobby that it makes people pipe down just to step on ' em  --  and have you noticed the Mellow-Lume lights that give that soft-flavored glow in the halls ?  --  Though , believe me ! there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator  --  and she do n't drink and never dozes !  --  I got picked up in Denver once by one of those heavy-lidded house-detectives , and any rough diamond from the West that tries to start shenanigans in his room will soon hear the voice of a pity-less fate cracking down on him over the phone !  --  But once you 're inside and once you 're all right , then you 're sittin ' on top of the world !  --  now are n't yuh on the crest ?  --  are n't yuh ? p. 42 CHET Just what you were saying , Beppo ? BOSTOCK I 'll bet you were saying so ! Why would n't yuh ? You 're luxurious here  --  you 're looked up to ! You 're in a position to high-hat anybody in the world ! ( As Beth and Charlotte smile ) Do n't laugh ! Do n't we all like to Ritz people ? Do n't we really ? BETH Of course ! BOSTOCK Of course we do ! We all like a thing better because we know other people ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see it ! you 're just the very clientele that I built this place expressly for !  --  In a way you get more out of it than I do , because I always see it behind the scenes .  --  Say , sometimes I 've wished I was a stranger checking in here for the first time ! As I walk along the halls at night and look at the slits of light , I think to myself , There 's Life !  --  Life as it ought to be lived ! Glamor ! Poetry ! Passion ! Excitement , Beauty , Success ! Charming sophisticates like yourselves  --  old tapestries and gloriously striped bath-towels  --  a service that thanks you twice and never shows surprise at anything  --  a radio by every bedside , an ice-water tap in every bathroom ! A really civilized atmosphere  --  now is n't it ?  --  You 've seen the real old prints of English fox-hunts and the engravings of French grandes dames having their fun in their boudoirs !  --  And say : I 'm soon going to put in taps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 BETH What a marvelous idea ! BOSTOCK Is n't it marvelous ?  --  But , as I say , it 's all for you ! Sometimes  --  here 's a funny thing ! maybe you wo n't believe it but it 's the fact ! sometimes I feel that though I 'm boss here , I 'm never going to get past the lobby ; sometimes I feel like my own house detective was going to jump me in my room ! So it 's you who 're the real insiders here ! In a way , I 'm still an outsider . CHET We exist in your imagination . BEPPO And sometimes for a moment in our own . CHET You 've had the r-really exciting life , though . BOSTOCK Well , anyway , the pay-off is this : today when I go to the Ritz in Paris , I 've only got to give a belch and the manager sends me roses ! The telephone rings , and Beppo answers it : an excited blaring voice is heard , so ear-splitting that Beppo has to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I see  --  that 's quite all right Yes : do come in later if you can Yes : I understand  --  I 'm sorry Goodby  --  yes : do come if you can ! ( Hanging up ) That 's Godbrow Gibbs , who was supposed to come : he says he 's too busy to eat . p. 44 BOSTOCK You bet he 's busy ! He 's busy as hell ! Godbrow Gibbs holds a mortgage on the Richelieu-Versailles , and he and my other creditors are working night and day right now to assemble the biggest plot of ground in New York ! We 're going to borrow enough money for the super-colossal hotel of the world that will meet my obligations on this one ! It 's Napoleonic , but I 'll swing it !  --  ( With a glance at Charlotte ) Where 's your " go-bust " then ? CHARLOTTE Just a few weeks farther off . BEPPO ( to Bostock ) . Look here : why do n't you stay to dinner ? You 've evidently been sent us by Heaven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be enchant ! Sure you want me ? It 's damn decent of you to ask me when I 've barged in on you uninvited like this and talked like a burst main ! The telephone rings , and Chang goes to answer it . BEPPO Not at all  --  very happy to have you !  --  CHANG That 's for you , Miss Miles . It 's Mr. Payne .  --  ( To Beppo ) Dinner is ready . Mimi goes to the phone . MIMI Hello Oh : just a minute ( To Beppo ) I 'll use the upstairs phone so I wo n't disturb you . Jack 's got some kind of long story to tell . p. 45 BEPPO Is it necessary ? Well , we wo n't wait for you . Do n't be too long ! She hurries up the stairs and disappears in her room . BEPPO Shall we go in ? The ladies go first . LONGBROKE ( to Bostock ) . To a Britisher like myself that seems rather a risky way of doing things , what you were telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America ? BOSTOCK You British are too damn conservative !  --  it takes Yankee initiative to put it over !  --  ( To Beppo , after everybody else has gone into the dining-room ) Oh , if you 'll pardon me a moment , I ought to call up the desk and let them know where I am . You go in  --  I 'll join you in a jiffy . BEPPO Certainly : the house phone 's right there . BOSTOCK Right-o ! Beppo and Longbroke go in . Bostock , left alone , glances toward the dining-room door , then in the direction of Mimi 's room . He then takes a paper of cocaine from his pocket and administers a liberal sniff . In the meantime , a silent figure has appeared just inside the entrance to the hall  --  a young , pale , rather tense-looking man , nattily dressed in a light gray suit . He is intently watching Bostock . Mimi comes out of her room and starts down the stairs . Bostock goes toward the phone . Mimi sees the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right  --  Mr. Payne just got me on the phone  --  p. 46 Bostock , hearing her voice , looks up at her . The man fires twice at Bostock , then disappears through the hall . Bostock puts his left hand to his right shoulder and collapses on the sofa , where he sits panic-stricken and gasping . Mimi , on the stairs , stands petrified . Beppo comes rushing in from the dining-room , followed by the guests and Chang . BEPPO What 's happened ? ( Bostock does not answer. ) @x Chet , Charlotte , Longbroke , Beth and June drinking highballs after dinner . A bottle of Scotch on the table . CHET And w-when I w-woke up in the morning , there were five glasses of water on the table . I 'd put them there before I went to bed . BETH You poor dear ! you used to do that when you were married to me.  --  I think there were only three then . CHET And since then every time we give a party , I write a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and I put it in my pocket and take it out and read it from time to time . CHARLOTTE It would n't be a bad plan if you did it before other people 's parties ! CHET No : the wh-whole idea of a party is that the guests are supposed to drink . You take turns being the host and keeping sober . JUNE We get some funny drunks at the Purple Hour ( Giggling ) There was one woman in there the other night all dressed up in ermine like a sore thumb and she went away so plastered that she was afraid to stand up in the elevator and she hiked down the whole five flights on her fanny ! BETH You heard about Peggy Fisher 's little exploit in Central Park ? p. 48 THE OTHERS No.  --  No.  --  What ? BETH She wandered away from a party at the Jamisons  --  feeling the need of a little fresh air  --  and walked over as far as the reservoir , and then she heard somebody running behind her , and she looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his BVD 's coming after her with lustful intent . She ran around the reservoir , and the man ran around after her . They did two or three laps before she got wise to the fact that he was merely a runner in his track pants . Laughter . LONGBROKE Strange to think that there 's just been a shooting here ! Do people always treat them so casually ? CHET There 's r-really nothing we can do about it ? LONGBROKE Was it really a gangster affair , do you suppose ? CHET S-so the policemen said . This man evidently knew they 'd put him on the spot , and that was why he came in here . It s-seems he 'd been expected somewhere else , and he 'd evidently gotten scared and stayed away . JUNE I 've heard about Fred Bostock : he 's in the dope racket . CHARLOTTE No doubt the police know all about him  --  know exactly who shot him and why . But they wo n't do anything about it ! The whole situation is unspeakable ! p. 49 CHET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of the underworld code . JUNE Those cops were a couple of dumb clucks !  --  They could n't find out anything , anyway ! BETH I do n't know  --  I thought the tall thin one seemed keen  --  but then I have a yen for slim men with prematurely gray hair . LONGBROKE Really ? I much preferred the other one  --  the one with the big shoulders ! CHET That shows h-how the underworld is creeping up on us now  --  that we should talk about having " yens " for people . That 's underworld slang , I understand . BETH Yes : people used to have " crushes , " did n't they ?  --  crushes were sentimental . CHET Whereas " yen " is simply thieves ' gibberish.  --  And a business used to be a " game , " nowadays it 's always a " racket . " BETH It 's affecting the fashions , too . Adalbert Fisher , it seems , makes Phoebe wear white gloves , so that she 'll look like a gunman 's moll . CHET She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could deceive me ! CHARLOTTE That does n't account for everything . Why does he make her get up at two in the morning and sit with a paper-bag over her head ? p. 50 BETH People get their fun in strange ways ! JUNE I 'll say ! CHET That d-does n't seem strange ' to me at all : if I were m-married to Phoebe Fisher , I 'd think it was the most natural thing in the world to put her head in a p-paper-bag ! CHARLOTTE Her efforts to make him jealous are pathetic ! BETH Adalbert is n't quite bright himself . He threatened to drown himself in Lake Placid once because I refused to fly with him , and I stopped him by telling him he 'd be sure to catch cold . Dr. Tinker and Beppo come in from the hall . CHET Well , how is he getting along , Doctor ? DR . TINKER Nothing serious ! He 'll just have to wear his arm in a sling for a couple of weeks or so . BEPPO That gunman must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that you ca n't be too careful nowadays about whom you invite to dinner . CHET I th-thought you were taking a chance . BEPPO I thought if I cultivated him socially , I might induce him to come down on the rent . BETH He was hopped up like a Hollywood director . He had enough snow on the lapels of his coat to do the big blizzard scene from The Old Homestead . p. 51 DR . TINKER He 's a thorough-going neurotic , but he wo n't let one do anything for him . BEPPO Dr. Tinker 's by way of being an analyst . DR . TINKER Not a professional one : I only fool around with it . CHARLOTTE I do n't approve of that . DR . TINKER I should n't care to be a professional analyst . I dislike so very much the class of people one would have to have as colleagues . BETH You must have a rich field as house physician here . DR . TINKER I should say that 70 per cent of the people here have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TINKER  --  And a good many of the rest have psychoses . CHET Gee ! DR . TINKER The others are borderline cases . Like our poor friend Bostock here , they 've taken to drink or drugs in the hope of escaping from neurotic anxieties . BEPPO Wo n't you have a drink , by the way ? DR . TINKER Thank you , yes .  --  ( Beppo pours him one and he takes it . ) Last week , for example , I had a pathetic young man who used to wake up every morning and think he had to jump out the window . A plain case of conviction of guilt based on a mother complex . p. 52 BEPPO ( to Beth ) . Where 's Mimi ? BETH She went up to her room . She was a little upset over the shooting . I think she 's all right though . I gave her some spirits of ammonia . BEPPO I 'll go up for a minute if you do n't mind .  --  Why not move into the library and get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play you her new stuff . CHET Swell ! JUNE I do n't know if they want to hear it . BETH We 're mad to hear it ! She immediately takes command and herds June and Longbroke into the library . Beppo starts for the stairs , but is halted by the ringing of the door-bell . Chang comes out of the dining-room to answer it , and Mimi appears at her door . CHET ( to Dr. Tinker ) . W-What did your young man with the feelings of guilt think he was guilty of ? DR . TINKER Swindling people  --  selling them bad bonds . CHARLOTTE How do you know he had n't ? DR . TINKER He had , as a matter of fact . CHET Then h-how do you know it was a mother complex ? p. 53 DR . TINKER If he had n't been a neurotic , he would n't have worried about it . They follow the others into the library . BEPPO ( to Chang , returning from the hall ) . Who is it ?  --  Mr. Gibbs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! ( Mimi starts downstairs ; he looks up at her . ) All right , but do n't bring him into the library . MIMI Ask him to come in here , Chang . Beppo goes into the library . Chang ushers in Jack Payne . He is well set-up and good-looking , about thirty ; wears a dress suit . With June and in the scenes that follow , he imposes himself by frankness and boldness . During his conversation with Mimi , June is heard playing jazz , lively or sentimental . MIMI Hello ! PAYNE Hello , Radiant ! He kisses her . MIMI We 've just been having great excitement here . PAYNE What type of excitement ? MIMI Why , a screwball named Luke Bostock  --  it seems he owns the hotel  --  suddenly erupted on us , and then somebody else turned up and shot him . p. 54 Payne raises his eyebrows . PAYNE Fatal ? MIMI No ; he was n't badly hurt , it seems  --  but , Jack , I happened to come downstairs just as the man fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I 'm sure it was Al Gammel . PAYNE ( after a second 's thought ) . It could have been him . He 's been over with those Second Avenue mugs . MIMI He 's not with you any more ? PAYNE Not since a couple of weeks . He doped so he was n't no good no more . If he missedum , it must have been Al . MIMI But why should they want to shoot Bostock particularly ? PAYNE Bostock 's got delusions of grandeur  --  thinks he 's a big dealer . MIMI What do you mean ? PAYNE Gambling joint on the floor below this , with everything that goes with it . MIMI Really ? How amazing ! PAYNE I suppose some of those Second Avenue pansies got dissatisfied with him for some reason . He 'd double-crossed them probably  --  tried to do business with somebody else . They 're tough , those East Side hoodlums  --  they 're the boys that shave with blow-torches . Do n't let it worry you though  --  there 's a lot of haphazard popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gone ? p. 55 MIMI Yes .  --  You wo n't get involved in it , will you , on account of Al 's having worked for you ? PAYNE I never get involved .  --  You did n't talk to your father about that other thing ? MIMI I have n't had any chance . Besides , Jack , I guess that I ought to wait . He 'd hit the ceiling now . PAYNE He 's got to lose you sometime . MIMI After all , I 'm still supposed to finish school . PAYNE Listen : school is n't everything . I went to school awhile . When my mother took up with the corner druggist , they made me go to school  --  I finished a year of high-school  --  MIMI And you hated it ? PAYNE It was all right , but I did n't want no more About the only thing I learned there that was worth anything to me was the primary rules of polite intercourse The first month I went to School , whenever anybody made a pass at me  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd put up my mitts like this . Where I came from , you had to be ready to defend yourself against all comers  --  if you did n't put up your fists , you were a sap  --  as good as dead , see ?  --  Well , they taught me at school that in respectable society , any pass that is made at you by anybody is supposed to be in the way of kindness Well , a few pretenses like that , I figure , is about all an education can do for you  --  and you 've got all the pretenses down perfect . p. 56 MIMI I know : school is terribly silly  --  but I 'm supposed to go to Mother in the spring , and it would really be easier to work it then . I could just go away with you instead . Why do you insist on going now ? PAYNE I thought I 'd told you that . MIMI But we 'll still be seeing each other . PAYNE When you belong to each other , you belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is  --  neither one thing nor the other ! MIMI We 've been something to each other the last two weeks . PAYNE Yes , and then you get up and turn on the light and I have to take you home ! MIMI I know : it 's perfectly heart-breaking  --  PAYNE You say your father is sore . Why not break in to him and get it over ? MIMI I know that it would harrow him too much just now  --  PAYNE Say , think about me sometimes ! I 've been waiting for you all my life . You 're the only girl I ever wanted to marry . I 've had women I took around , but not as an equal  --  not like you . Some birds take these night-club hotcha girls and try to put them over on the stage  --  some take these cigarette and coat-room girls and try to put them over as hotcha  --  some take girls on their block and give them a job selling cigarettes . But not me ! I would n't try to make nothing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has got it developed already  --  I do n't want any woman that 's got to depend on something that somebody else can do for them ! I 've passed ' em all up : night-club hostesses and dancers  --  Ritzy lady gyps ! Some people will ruin themselves for a tart with a big reputation  --  p. 57 MIMI Dad fell for one once  --  his third wife . PAYNE Lots do . But not me ! When it comes to me , Ritz is n't enough and hotcha is n't enough  --  I 've got to have a real natural princess that burns with her own power ! MIMI You 'll turn a girl 's head with that princess stuff ! PAYNE You know what you said that night on the boat . MIMI You remember what you said about letting me arrange it any way I wanted . PAYNE When you love somebody , you 'd ought to be with them . Christ , what else is there to life ?  --  The whole thing 's phony if you look at it that way . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might be absolutely on the level  --  you might give everybody his due and never double-cross anybody  --  but ninety-nine per cent of them are ready to double-cross you . Why ? Because they 're naturally snakes ? No : because they 're ambitious just like you are . But you ca n't let them get away with it , and then you 're the hard-hearted bastard . And after while you do n't trust nobody that 's anywhere near as wise as you are , and the people that you trust , they 're not wise and you ca n't get interested in them . It 's what I say , you want your equal ! I used to have a girl that I 'd take on that boat  --  and she was all right in a way , but I was all the time having to make her pipe down and I never gave her a third drink !  --  I want to have that boat with somebody that she and I can enjoy it together ! p. 58 MIMI It would be awful if I realized some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PAYNE Why , once we get aboard that boat , we wo n't need to worry about nothing ! A boat is about the only place , I figure , where people can really be free . We 'll look the whole world over : Havana  --  Panama  --  Honolulu ! You could take that boat to Europe , and we 'll do it some day ! We 'll be King and Queen on the old Ace of Hearts !  --  just us two together ! When I named her , I did n't know you but I named her after you ! MIMI This sounds like a musical comedy ! When do we go into our song ? PAYNE So I 'm just another crooner ! That 's all it means to you , huh , when I tell you how much I love you ? The sound of the piano has stopped . As Mimi is about in reply , Longbroke and Beppo come in from the library . BEPPO ( coldly ) . Oh , how do you do , Payne ? MIMI Mr. Longbroke , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not , Mr. Jack Payne , the celebrated bootlegger ? Mimi is embarrassed , but Payne takes it humorously . PAYNE Well , I do n't exactly answer phone calls : I 'm more in the wholesale business . p. 59 LONGBROKE I see : American bootlegging is really one of the national industries , is n't it ? PAYNE ( smiling ) . It seems to have its place in the picture . BEPPO ( who has been looking at Mimi to see the effect of this revelation  --  wondering whether she knew already ) . So you 're in the liquor business , Mr. Payne ? PAYNE I do some importing and brewing . LONGBROKE I 'm surprised at your not having heard of him  --  Mr. Payne is a well-known person ! BEPPO I do n't follow bootlegging closely . ( To Payne ) Wo n't you have a drink , by the way ? PAYNE Thank you . BEPPO Help yourself  --  you know what you like . I 'd be interested to have your professional opinion on that . It 's supposed to be Old Hallowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Old Hallowell . It 's all right : it 's not cut very much . But it 's not Old Hallowell . I 'll send you some real Old Hallowell , and you 'll be able to see the difference . BEPPO Do n't bother , thanks . I have a regular man , and I may as well stick to him . p. 60 MIMI Jack 's offering you a present , Dad ! BEPPO Oh , I see : I beg your pardon . Thank you very much , but do n't trouble !  --  ( to Longbroke ) This must all seem ghastly to you . Imagine the liquor trade outlawed and driven underground , till it gets into the hands of the criminal classes . In England , your great brewers and distillers get knighthoods ; in America , they get night-clubs ! MIMI Is that the best you can do , Dad ? You 'd better leave wisecracks to Jimmy Walker ! LONGBROKE I do n't believe our biggest distillers , you know , make half as much as your big bootleggers . Al Capone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , is n't it ? BEPPO I really do n't know  --  PAYNE It 's hard to tell : you can figure out how much Capone makes , but you ca n't tell how much it costs him in campaign funds and things like that . LONGBROKE I say : I do n't suppose there 'd be any sort of opening for a chap like me in your racket ? You people do a lot of business with our steamship lines , I understand . PAYNE Might be . The right kind of Englishman can get away with murder . LONGBROKE I 'm afraid I should n't be good at murder . That 's a department of commercial activity that we have n't done much with in England . I was thinking of the business side . p. 61 MIMI That 's just a saying , Mr. Longbroke : he did n't mean real murder . LONGBROKE But that sort of thing does happen  --  the shooting of this fellow here tonight , for example . BEPPO It does happen : your mistake was natural . And the liquor interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  You 've got some swell pictures here . I do a little collecting myself  --  just grabbed off some Periwinkos.  --  What 's this ? BEPPO That 's a Periwinko . PAYNE He must have had the rams when he did that one . Or maybe he had n't learned to draw yet . BEPPO As a matter of fact , it 's recent . PAYNE Well , Paris gets a man in the long run ! BEPPO After all , you know , everybody in Paris is n't making whoopee all the time , like American tourists on the loose . Periwinko does n't spend all his nights at night-clubs ! PAYNE Paris gets a man just the same , and here 's the way it gets him . Now take us Americans , for instance : whatever life offers us , we eat it up : work , play , speed , liquor , love . Whereas the French have to sniff things before they can drink them  --  and when they do start to drink them , they just sip them  --  and by the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something to drink and they 're talking about the way it sniffs . And that 's the reason I say that Paris is the finish of a man like Periwinko : it 's got him so he only gives out whiffs . Those pictures are just a couple of whiffs ! p. 62 BEPPO ( getting angrier and angrier ) . No doubt of it : what poor Periwinko needs is a good souse on bootleg Scotch ! LONGBROKE Mr. Payne takes the opposite view from our friend Mr. Bostock just now . Bostock wants to outdo the French , but Mr. Payne has the courage of his tastes . PAYNE ( turning seriously to Longbroke ) . If you get that outdoing idea , you 're ruined . I say , find out what you really get a kick out of and do it for the kick ! BEPPO It must be a great advantage to have tastes that are so easily satisfied . PAYNE Well , everything is bound to go sour on you if you stay around here too long  --  and that 's why I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from here . That 's why I own a boat . MIMI We 'd better leave here , at any rate , if the show begins at II . PAYNE O.K. , Princess .  --  ( To Beppo , shaking hands ) Well , good night now . Nice to have seen you . ( To Longbroke , shaking hands ) Good night . LONGBROKE I say : do n't forget my suggestion ! PAYNE Fine : let 's talk about it . Give me a buzz . p. 63 Chet drifts in from the library , with his glass in his hand . MIMI Well , good night , Mr. Longbroke . Good night , Chet . Say good night to the rest for me , will you ? CHET Oh , are you going out , Mimi ? Well , we h-hate to see you go , but our loss is somebody 's gain ! BEPPO ( to Mimi ) . Do n't make it an all-night affair , please . Remember Miss French 's in the morning ! MIMI I came of age last month , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands looking after them , baffled and resentful . Longbroke takes advantage of the moment to go over to the cigarette box and put a supply in his pocket . LONGBROKE I say : you do n't mind if I lift a few cigarettes . BEPPO ( to Chet ) . Mimi 's gone out with a bootlegger ! What can you do about children nowadays ? CHET Do-Do n't worry about Mimi , Beppo !  --  she 's a f-fine little girl ! These kids know how to take care of themselves . They 're not scared of life  --  it 's swell ! BEPPO I know , but they 're so confoundedly sophisticated ! No sentiment ! No romance ! they do n't even take each other seriously . Mimi does n't care an atom about that fellow : all she wants is some new excitement ! p. 64 Beth appears at the library door . BETH Come back here , you saps !  --  we need men . Get away from those high-balls , Chet ! Come back in here , Horseley  --  I want to hear your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the library with her . Beppo and Chet continue their conversation . CHET ( shaking his head ) .  --  But the grown people are n't any better . P-People are n't human any more  --  they 're g-getting more and more that way  --  BEPPO They 're desperately unhappy most of them . Look how many are going to pieces !  --  Let me freshen your drink . CHET Thank you . ( Holding out his glass )  --  I know ; and that 's why the only thing is to hold on tight to art ! Damn it all ! ( Clenching his fist in a slightly drunken gesture of earnestness ) Hold on to art ! Art is the only thing left that can keep us from cracking up ! When I go back into my studio every morning , it does n't matter what I leave behind  --  I find something there that I can fasten on to like  --  like a sea-anemone blooming with the tide on his rock . Suppose it 's only a jug  --  a white jug , say , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a jug and two green tomatoes ! but there 's something that ca n't disintegrate : there 's form ! There 's something that ca n't go bilious : there 's color ! The sun may be rising and setring on a washed-up generation , but there are a few rays from it that have n't been spoiled by liver-specks dancing around in them . The light from the days that have faded is still there in green and white on the canvas  --  it 's still there in the tomatoes and the jug . You may fade out yourself every evening , and finally you 'll fade out entirely , but you 've made something that lives in the world of art  --  you 've succeeded in putting something of yourself into something outside yourself , and it may still be there when you 've folded up ! p. 65 BEPPO That 's all right for you , Chet  --  you 're a painter , you can do it . But I 'm not really an artist  --  CHET Of course , you are  --  do n't be silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHET That 's all that Hogarth could do  --  that 's all that Goya was doing ! BEPPO But I 'm not in their class . CHET You 're fine , Beppo  --  you 're swell ! You 've got a bite and  --  and an imagination that nobody else can touch ! BEPPO But what good will all that be when I 'm working for Godbrow Gibbs ? People like Hogarth and Goya did n't have to boost American business ! I 'm not really keen on this job ! After years of doing glad girls for magazines , I thought I 'd earned the right to do cynical tigers , and now I ca n't bear the idea of having my nasty little tigers go glad ! CHET Do n't do it !  --  keep them sour as hell ! BEPPO But I ca n't now that Art and Fashion is dead ! CHET ( shaking his head ) . Do n't sell out ! Never sell out ! BEPPO Good God , Chet ! I 've got to draw for a living ! You have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own . I bet you would n't find that jug and apples were such an impregnable Rock of Ages if they were really the only support you had ! p. 66 CHET You know , if this were only Mexico , a man with your kind of talent could make little pottery figures and tiles with animals on them  --  you could do all sorts of charming things ! BEPPO Yes : if I 'd been born a Mexican Indian , I might have been really happy . I could have sat in my sunny little patio and made little jugs and banks and have felt myself a part of the life of the people  --  part of their civilization ! CHET Exactly : what you made would be used for something ! That 's the trouble with modern art  --  what we do is n't ever used ! BEPPO Good God , Chet  --  that may be true of you exhibiting artists who do nothing but adorn the galleries , but I can tell you it is n't the case with me . Once I start working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Picking up the evening paper ) Look at that ! that 's where I 'll be  --  just underneath the Gonk family  --  on the same page with one of those lousy cartoons that have everything in them but the kitchen stove ! Here 's Miriam Followell Forbes , you see , advising girls to do their necking in the hallways rather than ask the young men up to their rooms  --  and here 's Herman Godbrow Gibbs emitting his daily blatt of balderdash ! And here 's poor old Beppo Miles with his poor little old half-hearted tigers being used to help put over Gibbs 's balderdash !  --  Well , the Gibbses and the Paynes have won out in our world , and there does n't seem to be anything left for us except to try to be as vulgar as they are , in the hope of getting some of the loot ! p. 67 The telephone : Beppo goes ; Gibbs 's voice again . BEPPO Oh , hello , Mr. Gibbs that 's all right  --  it does n't matter . No , come whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect to be up indefinitely All right . No : that 's all right . Goodby . CHET My God , he sounds like a lost bull ! BEPPO He 's hot-foot after Prosperity !  --  Well , maybe the old dear can snare it !  --  If I lend him my little tigers to smile hope and faith back into people 's hearts , I 'll be able to afford the luxury of spitting on their dearest beliefs !  --  Let me freshen up your drink . He does so and fills his own glass . CHET If you c-could only c-combine what Gibbs has got with what the Mexican p-peasants have got ! I 'm going to drop another penny in that cow in honor of the Mexican peasants ! ( He does so . ) Beth comes back from the library . BETH They need drinks in there , Beppo ! Why do n't you look after your guests ? You ought to have had him put a bottle in the library . BEPPO ( ringing for Chang ) . Do you find that Beth still tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETH Charlotte 's evidently making a better job of it . Chang appears at the dining-room door . BEPPO Bring another bottle of Scotch , Chang . CHET I 've got a better working routine now . BETH And she 's got an artist to go with her studio , so everything is perfectly splendid ! CHET Charlotte has a stabilizing effect  --  you and I used to get on each other 's nerves so . BETH Yes : I was n't much of a stabilizer , I 'm afraid . CHET ( to Beppo ) . One winter when we were out on the Coast , we sat through a whole earthquake and never knew whether it had really happened  --  we thought maybe it was just a new neuro symptom . Neither of us dared mention it to the other till we saw it in the paper the next morning . BEPPO ( to Beth ) . Were you and Chet in California worse than you and I in Paris ? BETH You and I would never have sat and jittered  --  it was knock-down and drag-out with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cared so much about me ! p. 69 BETH Have we got to go into that at this time of day ? CHET I used to get jealous of you and wonder why Beth was so fond of you  --  she being so unsentimental and you such a romantic ham . Then I realized it was the ham in you that attracted her , and I knew that was something I could never give her ! Chang has brought the Scotch and gone back . BEPPO You go to hell !  --  you and your tomatoes ! Why green tomatoes , anyway ? Why not red tomatoes ? BETH Let Chet 's tomatoes alone , Beppo , and attend to the drink situation ! Why did n't you have him take it into the library ? June starts playing again in the next room : Let 's Put Out the Lights and Go to Sleep . BEPPO Do stop worrying , Beth . You 're a guest here tonight  --  you 're supposed to relax ! BETH If your guests relaxed , there 'd be no party ! CHET ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! I 'll take the Scotch in . I want to hear the little jazz-player . He goes into the library with the tray . BETH I can do without any more of her . I do n't see that it 's so remarkably different from putting a nickel in the mechanical piano . p. 70 BEPPO She has unmistakable talent , I think . BETH She was just telling me about her relations . It seems they line up at the stage door every Saturday afternoon and make her give them most of her salary . BEPPO Yes : I 've asked her why she lets them have it all , and she says : " Why , they used to rob houses and stick people up for me , so I 've got to do something for them . " It 's a much simpler kind of morality than the kind we pretend to practice , but they come nearer to living up to it . BETH Beppo , you 're full of bilge ! I suppose you 'll be paying her alimony soon . You 're certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not marrying any more . BETH That 's good news ! BEPPO I do n't regret my first two marriages though . BETH How sweet of you to say so ! BEPPO No , I mean it  --  I often miss you terribly still . Nobody for drinks at the end of the day  --  nobody to sit down and gab with ! BETH What about Mimi and June ? BEPPO For one thing , they 're both too young . As you get older , it 's not the same with people . You want people who have shared your experience . And it 's funny what it does to you to split up with somebody you 've loved and lived with : it 's as if you 'd cut off a whole part of your past  --  as if you could n't use it any more . It 's almost as if you could lose your youth by not sticking with the people you loved when you were young . You can never be young for new people . p. 71 BETH So far as I 'm concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't known me ! BEPPO Yes , I know : that 's true once you 've separated . Old love affairs make you uncomfortable . It 's the ache in the hand that 's been amputated . BETH The pain in the decapitated neck ! BEPPO And there 's nothing you can do about it : you can never get back to what 's been broken . We just have to go on being carried along to the new girls and the new lovers with whom we can never have youth in common  --  BETH Shut up !  --  I 'm almost eight years younger than you !  --  and my next union 's going to be a permanent one ! BEPPO ( holding up his glass ) . Here 's to the next Duchess of Wormwood Scrubs ! BETH ( holding up her glass in retort ) . Here 's to your career as a patron of gifted night-club entertainers ! BEPPO Hail and farewell , my dear ! BETH Do n't get maudlin , Beppo ! June in the next room stops playing . Longbroke comes back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wondering what had become of you ! p. 72 BETH Oh , Horseley ! I 'm right here and longing for you ! BEPPO Well , I 'll leave you two young people together ! BETH Do ! Beppo goes into the library . LONGBROKE It was so swell to find you here ! BETH It was so perfectly glorious to find you ! He kisses her , and she meets him emphatically . BETH Again ! They kiss again . BETH Let 's sit down . They sit down on the sofa . LONGBROKE Well , how have you been shaping up ? BETH Now let me advise you , Horseley : you 'd much better let American alone . That is n't right at all ! I 'm already shaped : ca n't you see ? LONGBROKE Oh . BETH ( very animated again ) . If you want to know how I 've been , I 've been horrid ! I hate my apartment and I hate my work and I hate the woman I work for !  --  I hate everything except you ! ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 73 LONGBROKE You 've been such a godsend to me ! BETH And my heart 's not often stirred , I can assure you  --  it has n't registered a tremor for ages . I have n't been able to give a damn whether I ever saw anybody 's sickening face since God knows when ! LONGBROKE I like you awfully , too BETH Do you really , my dear ? I know you do ! LONGBROKE Yes , truly  --  I 'm frightfully keen on you !  --  I suppose the decorating business does get to be quite odious in the long run  --  though you went into it merely for the fun of the thing , did n't you ? BETH Fun ! Do you think I kiss the asses of Central Park West for fun ? Do you imagine that anything but the direst necessity would ever have landed me in the clutches of that foul old harpy Ada Force ?  --  It 's no fun for me , I assure you , to palm off Ada 's middle-class excrement as the pomp of the Medicis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I thought you did it more or less as a hobby . BETH No , my dear , it 's the way I make my living ! LONGBROKE I see .  --  But I suppose it justifies itself from the remunerative point of view . p. 74 BETH Not for me ! My remuneration is a lousy little walk-up on Lexington Avenue ! There 's an addressograph up above me and a furrier underneath , and it sounds like a boiler factory and smells like a million wet cats ! LONGBROKE But your firm has the reputation of being extremely successful . BETH Ada 's successful  --  the business is successful . But the only thing that I get out of it is a teeny-weeny little salary and a commission on the jobs I bring in . And as I bring in damn few jobs , I get damn little commission . The idea was that I frequented social regions where Ada did n't penetrate and that I was to go out and bag highclass customers . But although I can be brash about anything else , I 'm reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations to put over commercial deals ! It 's just too obscene and impossible ! LONGBROKE Still , one should n't let such opportunities slip . BETH Listen to him : is n't he sweet trying to talk like a go-getting business man ! ( She kisses him . ) As if you could make capital out of your social connections ! No decent Englishman could dream of it . You could n't do it , my dear , if your very life depended on it ! And in my case the final result has been that , instead of bringing back big game from Park Avenue , I find myself over in Brooklyn among the gefllte-fish , designing bedroom , dining-room and living-room in mulberry , orchid and blue for families that live in the kitchen ! p. 75 LONGBROKE That does seem an odd occupation .

When I see you , all the sordid and beastly and rancid and grating things  --  all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a fresh gust of air from the English downs ! I used to adore England !  --  those light feathery forests they have in Surrey and those tiny little silver rivers that look as if they 'd been arranged by gardeners ! And the marvelous big country houses that still look like Elizabethan England , way back behind their grounds and hedges ! We do n't have anything here like that ! We do n't have that distinction and dignity ! Those places are so tranquil and so sure of themselves ! They do n't have to truckle and grab and scheme !  --  And you know that they stand for the loyalties that last for ever and ever . LONGBROKE My place in England just now is in frightfully bad condition ! BETH What a perfect public school boy he is ! Your house is in frightful condition !  --  Kiss me , you sweet thing ! ( He kisses her , but she brusquely pulls her lips away . ) You kissed me coldly that time ! What 's the matter ? What did I do to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been charming ! p. 76 BETH No : there 's something you do n't like ! What is it ? What did I do ? Was I loud ?  --  did my bad language jar on you ? I 'm really the prude of the world , you know ! I 'm sorry that I shot off my mouth in such a great big blat of blah ! but I go around the shop all day like a little furtive mouse and I have to howl and bawl when I get away ! LONGBROKE One does need to blow off steam , I think .  --  I say : shall we join the others ? BETH Good heavens , Horseley ! What is it ?  --  I never saw such a chill descend ! It ca n't be just my neurotic imagination ! LONGBROKE Nothing , truly . It 's just getting a bit late , and I wanted to have a word with Mrs. Chives about the bathroom fixture field . BETH Horseley , can it be that I 've been wrong about you ? Can it be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He hesitates a moment and has just opened his mouth to say something when the rest of the party come back . All except June have drinks in their hands . BEPPO We 've decided to play the phonograph ! The evening seems to have reached that point ! He looks through the records , puts one on the machine , winds it up and starts it . CHET ( to June ) . You 're certainly a dandy jazz-player , June ! If only the serious composers had half the real sparkle in what they write that you 've got just in your fingers !  --  p. 77 BETH ( with bitterness ) . " If only " ! If only people were n't such worms ! The door-bell rings . Chang goes . BEPPO I suppose it 's our friend Gibbs at last ! They all look toward the hall . Luke Bostock appears , instead . His shoulder has been bandaged up , and he wears his arm in a sling , his dress-coat with its empty sleeve draped over it . Beppo turns off the phonograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old shootee ! I just wanted to tell you how damn sorry I was for the mess I occasioned tonight . It was rude of me to butt in in the first place  --  and it was ruder to get shot in your sittingroom ! Let me offer my sincerest apologies ! BEPPO Not at all ! We 're only relieved that you did n't get seriously hurt ! BOSTOCK Just a scratch in the shoulder , that 's all !  --  DR . TINKER You must look out for the psychic strain ! BOSTOCK Do n't worry about me , Doc !  --  I feel splendid ! A little work-out with a bullet clears the brain ! BEPPO Wo n't you sit down and have'a drink ? ( He looks toward the table , then rings for Chang. ) p. 78 BOSTOCK No drink , thanks , but I 'll sit down if it wo n't pester you ! BEPPO No , no ! delighted to have you !  --  ( As Chang appears at the dining-room door ) Another bottle of Scotch Chang  --  and ice and glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not daily occurrences in the life of the Richelieu-Versailles  --  BEPPO ( smiling ) . I 'm not uneasy at all . BOSTOCK It was a mutinous dish-washer  --  I 'm certain of it ! BEPPO Do you think so ? Chang brings in the Scotch . BOSTOCK No question about it ! There was one that set up a howl when we put in the new dish-washing machines and had to lay some of them off  --  and my belief is it was him : a Red ! Beppo , struck by an idea , looks at Chang , who is just going back into the dining-room . BEPPO The radicals are popping at people , you think ? BOSTOCK Why not ? Look at everything else they 're doing ! They 're talking against the stock market and advertising unemployment and stirring up labor unrest !  --  they 're driving the banks to ruin by whispering insinuations against them ! Look at the way they 're treating religion !  --  blowing up churches in Russia and interrupting Bishop Manning right in the middle of his sermon ! p. 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio flood ? BOSTOCK Yes : they started that rumor , too !  --  But you do n't need to worry , charming people !  --  us big shots are the ones that take the risks !  --  we shoulder the big jobs , we give the public the big values , but we got to battle to do it !  --  and that 's where the thrill comes in ! You may think that business is tame , that it 's just paper-work done in offices , that we business men are just men of paper who leave the real struggle to others . But you do n't know the romance of business !  --  the romance and the glory and the agony ! A big business man , when he enters his office , hears more than just the racket of the typewriters  --  and the swish of the filing-cabinets and the ringing of the telephone bells !  --  he hears the clanging of armor  --  and the clash and the crash of lances !  --  the gallant jousting of the perfect gentle knights with their ladies ' favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their hauberks shining bright !  --  Why , such men as us crushed Carthage and we builded imperial Rome ! To the victor belong the spoils  --  Caesar was ambitious , why not ?  --  ( Abruptly changing his tone ) It 's a game of dog eat dog , and the dangerous part of it is that you 're liable to be bopped by any cockeyed hoodlum that happens to get a hate on you ! p. 80 BETH ( laughing ) . You had us all ready to leap on our chargers when you struck that sudden note of grisly realism ! BOSTOCK ( stopping them with a downward movement of the palm ) . All right ! all right !  --  but it 's us that have got to take it ! For you , the amenities of civilized living !  --  your money 's worth of sheer satisfaction !  --  For you , this refuge from the struggles of the age !  --  For you , this Caravanserai Beautiful !  --  Al Gammel has appeared in the doorway of the hall on the second floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoots at Bostock twice . Only Longbroke and Beppo are standing in a position to see him when they hear the shots and look up . Bostock crumples and falls ; he puts his hands to his side and groans . BEPPO Good God ! He and Dr. Tinker rush to Bostock and open his shirt . Chang comes in from the dining-room . BEPPO Call the police , Chang !  --  Somebody go after the gunman ! LONGBROKE One ought to have a gun , I think . BEPPO There 's one in the drawer of that table ! Longbroke gets out the gun and runs up the stairs , along the balcony and out into the upstairs hall . Chang has gone to the phone . BOSTOCK Not fatal necessarily , Doc ! Never touched the vital organs ! Just a couple of random shots in the stomach ! p. 81 DR . TINKER Go easy  --  we do n't want to start a hemorrhage ! Yes : one of them went right through here , you see .  --  Lift him up  --  very slowly , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch in the next room . Beppo , Tinker and Chet lift him . BETH ( to Charlotte , as she goes to help ) . This is beginning to get on my nerves ! She takes one side of Bostock . DR . TINKER ( to Beth ) . It 's purely psychological  --  a neurosis that compels him to become a victim . What be needs is a thorough analysis . BOSTOCK The hell you say , Doc ! What I need is a bodyguard ! They carry him into the library ; June and Charlotte follow . CHANG ( at the telephone  --  he has had difficulty getting the office and has been saying : Hello ! Hello , Office ! most of the time during the preceding conversation ) . Yes : again !  --  Mr. Bostock has been shot a second time ! Tell them to watch the doors to see that the assailant does not escape He ran out into the hall Yes . He hangs up ; Beppo comes back from the library . BEPPO Did you call the police ? p. 82 CHANG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going toward the telephone ) . Perhaps I 'd better call to make sure . CHANG I called them , Mr. Miles  --  I hope you do n't believe what he said : that he was shot by a class-conscious dishwasher . You do n't consider me responsible ? BEPPO I hope you were n't . CHANG Such acts are not committed by Communists . We know today that terrorism is infantile . What good would it do to shoot the Mr. Bostocks ? That would not bring the Revolution ! But in the meantime the Mr. Bostocks fall victims to their own inherent contradictions . Mr. Bostock 's crisis here tonight is only a particular instance of the general crisis of capitalism . In fulfilling his historic role , he generates the forces which destroy him . He was shot by a business rival . DR . TINKER ( appearing at the door  --  to Chang ) . Will you call up the drug-store  --  Eldorado 5-9829  --  and tell them to send some iodine ? ( To Beppo ) What an amazing case ! A regular classic of masochism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to kill him ! It 's no use fixing him up  --  he 'll only go and get plugged again ! p. 83 BETH ( coming to the door and taking him by the shoulder ) . Come back in here ! You ca n't psychoanalyze him now ! ( Addressing the people inside the room ) And everybody else get out ! June , Chet and Charlotte obey . Beppo and the Doctor go in . Chang finds the line busy and looks up another drug-store in the phone-book . CHARLOTTE ( to Chet ) . Beth is so competent at things like that !  --  it 's a pity that her opinion of her social position has kept her from being a trained nurse ! Longbroke comes back from his errand . LONGBROKE Not a trace of him ! Absolutely vanished ! He lays the gun on the table and helps himself to more cigarettes . CHET ( going over and pouring himself a drink ) . Good Lord ! What a t-terrible state of things ! A man ca n't be safe in his own apartment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONGBROKE The police-system over here is quite different from ours in England . Here the police , I understand , are in business with the criminal elements , but at home they try to catch the robbers and murderers and that sort of people , and see that they go to jail . p. 84 CHET If only the American government had some of the efficiency of the gangsters ! CHARLOTTE It 's outrageous ! I 'm going to the police myself ! I 'm going to the Police Commissioner ! Beppo comes back from the library and finds Chang still at the phone , asking the drug-store to send the iodine up . While Beppo and Chang are talking , the others talk among themselves . BEPPO ( when Chang has hung up the receiver ) . I thought you called up for that sometime ago ! CHANG The line was busy , Mr. Miles  --  I had to call another drug-store.  --  Mr. Miles , I request that you will not suspect me of sabotaging the medical necessaries for Mr. Bostock . I tell you it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidating the bourgeoisie ! BEPPO What did you mean just now when you said it was a business rival who shot him ? CHANG The liquor industry , like every other , in that degree to which it becomes more highly centralized , must to the same degree eliminate more and more persons .  --  BEPPO The liquor industry ? Is Bostock a bootlegger ? CHANG This Bostock is an importer of liquor and drugs as well as a proprietor of hotels . Concentration of trade in the hands of a few is characteristic of this phase of capitalism . He has been struggling with a formidable competitor , and he seems to be in danger of becoming one of the persons eliminated by the capitalist system . Thus life becomes more insecure for the bourgeois as well as the worker . p. 85 BEPPO How do you know all this ? CHANG It is a matter of common knowledge to everybody but the bourgeois intelligentsia . The more powerless the bourgeoisie becomes , the more it flees from facing its predicament . BEPPO I did n't know that this personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not offering personal criticism : I speak only of the predicament of a class . The Marxist should never be personal . The door-bell rings . Chang goes . Beppo looks toward the hall , expecting the police . CHARLOTTE If that 's the police , I 'm going to tell them what I think about the way they 've handled this business ! They left us here tonight with no protection at all ! Mimi and Payne appear from the hall . MIMI Hello , Dad ! BEPPO Oh , hello . Our friend Bostock has just been shot again ! MIMI Goodness ! Where ? Here ? BEPPO Yes , right here again just now . PAYNE Police here ? BEPPO Not yet . PAYNE Kill him ? BEPPO He 's still alive . p. 86 Mimi looks significantly at Payne . MIMI ( to Payne ) . Had n't you better go and see if you ca n't do something ? PAYNE What do you mean ? No . MIMI Did anybody see who did it ? BEPPO Yes : Longbroke and I saw him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long lean guy  --  evidently not the same one you saw . You said the one you saw was short and stocky . MIMI ( to the company ) . I 'm going to appeal to everybody here to help us to keep out of an awful jam . This shooting was really done by a man who used to work for Jack  --  this is Jack Payne : this is Mr. and Mrs. Chives and Miss Macy.  --  Jack did n't have anything to do with it , but the man who did the shooting used to work for him , and Jack might get into a lot of trouble if it was known he 'd been here tonight  --  so please do n't let anybody know !  --  Because , for one thing , if Jack gets mixed up in it , then we 'll all get mixed up in it , he being a friend of mine and having been in the apartment tonight  --  and it might be an awful mess for everybody ! PAYNE Here 's the truth , believe it or not : this poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine . He 'd been slipping a long time , and I fired him  --  he 's a hophead and practically nuts . Now be turns up and plugs one of my competitors , maybe thinking he 's doing me a favor , maybe with some grudge of his own . But I 'm not responsible in any way : I did n't want Bostock rubbed out . I was getting ready to quietly merge him . It 's just a load of grief to me that this dope should come and spoil your party and do his best to ruin my reputation  --  if not , as Mimi says , some other people 's reputations . p. 87 BEPPO I do n't know anything about your reputation , but we 're not in the least worried about ours ! PAYNE ( putting one hand in his coat pocket as if he was covering them with a gun ) . I ask you : even if I was the kind that goes gunning , is it likely that when I 'm interested in your daughter , I 'd bump off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BEPPO How do I know what you 're likely to do ? PAYNE Listen : if Bostock had been put on the spot , he would n't have survived the first treatment ! The real trained accredited gunman has got to be a crack shot . Why , they 've got them working out in gymnasiums with trapezes and rowing-machines  --  so I understand  --  they keep them in training like college athletes ! A real man-eating racketeer could n't afford to run the risk of a job like this here tonight ! If you saw this pansy with his pea-shooter , you must have known he was a phony ! BEPPO I find it very hard to distinguish between one racketeer and another ! MIMI Dad , we must have Jack go somewhere so that he wo n't run into the police ! She looks around swiftly . BEPPO ( turning to Mimi ) . Do you know what you 're asking me to do ? Do you know who your great-grandfather Buttonwood was ?  --  do you know that he was the leader of the Vigilance Committee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mining-camp full of cut-throats ?  --  p. 88 MIMI I know , Dad  --  but  --  BEPPO  --  Do you know that your grandfather , my father , was chief prosecutor for Kemp County , Illinois , and that he locked up so many robbers and sent so many gunmen to the gallows that they made him judge of the District Court , where he helped to forge the laws of this country ? The door-bell rings MIMI ( opening the big clock ) . Here : go in here , Jack ! There are n't any works in the bottom part . Beth Badger has always insisted that it ought to be used for something like this ! PAYNE If you 'll forgive me , folks ! It 's your interest as well as mine ! He gets in , and she closes the door . Chang comes through to answer the bell , paying no attention to what is happening . The company , with the exception of Charlotte , sit silent and frozen through this , afraid of Payne 's gun . CHARLOTTE You ought n't to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homicide Squad come in with Chang from the hall . BEPPO Well , here you are ! ( Laughing a little nervously ) You ought to have stuck around ! THE INSPECTOR They do n't usually go after the same man twice in the one night . p. 89 The clock , its machinery shaken , strikes four times . THE INSPECTOR Was the shot fatal ? Dr. Tinker comes back from the library . BEPPO Here 's the doctor . He can tell you . DR . TINKER He seems to be doing pretty well . It 's a miracle how the bullet passed through his abdomen without causing an internal hemorrhage . He likes to be shot  --  but only just so much .  --  ( To the Inspector ) However . do n't question him too long . THE INSPECTOR All right . He 's in there ? ( To Beppo ) We 'll question you people afterwards . Where were the shots fired ?  --  in here ? BEPPO Yes : from the balcony there . THE INSPECTOR Anybody see who did it ? BEPPO Only Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . THE INSPECTOR How did he happen to be in here again ? BEPPO He wanted to apologize to us . The poor fellow was evidently gaga . THE INSPECTOR All right , we 'll go in and see him . Do n't go away , please , till we 've questioned you . p. 90 BEPPO Right . The policemen go into the library and shut the door . The people in the room hold a low-voiced and tense conversation . BEPPO I ca n't say how humiliated I am . How can I even apologize ? But I suppose there 's nothing to be done for the present ! MIMI It does seem a little startling , I know  --  but it 's much the best way to deal with the situation , I think . CHARLOTTE It 'll be very startling indeed if we all have to stand trial for murder ! MIMI That 's just what I 'm trying to avoid . CHET You evidently get a different kind of training at Miss French 's nowadays , Mimi , from the kind they got when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach you poise at Miss French 's , you know , and that 's what I 'm trying to cultivate . BEPPO Why did you bring him back ? MIMI Why , there was n't any reason why I should n't . I did n't know that this idiotic man was absolutely crazy and was coming back to shoot him again ! BEPPO But you knew that this Payne might be suspected ! MIMI No , I did n't : I was the only person who saw the man who did the shooting before , and it seemed obvious he 'd gotten away . And I think that you and Mr. Longbroke ought to describe him the same way I did  --  because otherwise there 'll be a contradiction . p. 91 BEPPO No : he 'll have to take his chances once he 's out of here ! MIMI But if they do connect it with him , Dad , and if they find out that I 've been seen with him in night-clubs , why , then your name will get dragged into it , and that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The clock strikes three times . ) Incidentally , Mr. Longbroke , one reason Jack wanted to come back here was to ask you if you could n't go with him on a little yachting party that he 's having at the end of this week  --  if all this blows over peacefully . He took such a fancy to you  --  he thought it would give you a chance to talk about business together . LONGBROKE When ? What day ? MIMI He wanted to start Friday . LONGBROKE Oh !  --  Friday would be all right , I think . I had an engagement for Saturday , but I think I can get out of it quite easily .  --  Perhaps we 'd better see first , as you say , how the present situation turns out . MIMI ( smiling charmingly ) . It 's much more likely to turn out well , if you say you saw a short stocky man . BEPPO I propose to tell the truth ! MIMI Please do n't , Dad ! Suppose there 's real trouble ! p. 92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's coming to him ! Our reputations are n't in danger from the brawlings of degenerate gangsters ! MIMI Mine is , Dad ! BEPPO What do you mean ? You 're my daughter ! MIMI Dad : I 'm going to burst a bomb . I 'm sorry that it has to be now : I did n't want to tell you till later . But Jack and I are married ! BEPPO You 've married him ! MIMI Yes : two weeks ago . I did n't want to tell you till spring , because I knew it would upset you so , but  --  The policemen come back from the library . Beth follows , in one of Chang 's aprons . THE INSPECTOR All right ! I guess we wo n't need to take you all separately this time . Where was it that Bostock was standing ? CHET ( wanting to help Beppo out ) . J-just about here , I should say . The clock begins to strike again and mercilessly keeps on striking . THE INSPECTOR And where was the man who fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the balcony  --  he 'd evidently been watching from just inside the hall , and then he stepped out and fired two shots and ran out the door on the second floor . Mr. Longbroke ran after him , but he 'd gotten away . p. 93 THE INSPECTOR ( to Longbroke ) . You did n't see where he went ? LONGBROKE He 'd had time to escape before I could reach him . I had to go up those stairs and along the corridor . THE INSPECTOR You say only two of you saw him . BEPPO Mr. Longbroke and I were the only people who were facing in that direction . THE INSPECTOR What did he look like ? BEPPO I should say he was rather thickset . He might have been the same man my daughter saw . But , as I say , he was gone in a second . THE INSPECTOR What kind of a suit was he wearing ? BEPPO Why  --  a dark suit  --  it might have been dark brown or blue . THE INSPECTOR Which is the other gentleman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . THE INSPECTOR How would you describe him ? LONGBROKE A smallish man , I should say  --  and stoutish . THE INSPECTOR Did you notice the color of his clothes ? LONGBROKE Not particularly  --  I could n't say what color they were  --  but certainly on the dark side . p. 94 BETH Beppo , that clock must be going mad like everything else in this apartment ! It 's struck fifteen at least ! BEPPO ( trying to smile ) . Yes , I know . Yes : it 's always doing that . THE INSPECTOR ( seeing the revolver on the table and picking it up ) . What 's this ? BEPPO That 's my revolver . Mr. Longbroke took it to go after the gunman . The Inspector opens it , examines the cartridges and looks down the barrel . THE INSPECTOR Has n't been shot off , eh ? BEPPO No : I just keep it in case of emergency . THE INSPECTOR All right . That 's about the story , I guess . Nobody else saw anything , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . JUNE No : I did n't see him . BETH No : he was right above me . DR . TINKER We only heard the shots . CHET I h-happened to be right under the balcony . BEPPO ( to the Inspector ) . Any theories about who did it ? p. 95 THE INSPECTOR It 's a racketeering job , but I would n't know who to go after . So many people had motives to bump this Bostock off . He probably knows , but you ca n't gettum to tell .  --  Well , we wo n't trouble you any more tonight . Thank you . We 've got all your names and addresses . It was a piece of bad luck for you he was so dead set on coming to see you . Thought he 'd be safer here . I suppose .  --  Well , good night . BEPPO Good night . Thank you ! The policemen go out through the hall . CHET Th-Think of the implications of this scene ! CHARLOTTE ( squeezing his arm ) . Keep still ! BETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your magnificent furniture is losing its self-control . I 'm going to make it stop before somebody turns up and shoots it ! She goes over and opens the clock before anybody can stop her , and , seeing Payne inside , gives a cry . BETH Oh ! PAYNE ( stepping out ) . Yes : that clock ought to be fixed . It double-crossed us ! MIMI This is Miss Badger , Jack  --  this is Jack Payne , my husband . This shooting tonight was all a mistake , but we thought it was just as well for the cops not to see Jack in the apartment . p. 96 BETH Your husband , Mimi ? What is this ?  --  a rehearsal for a surraliste play ? BEPPO It looks like one ! You 're no more amazed than I am ! This piece of news has only just been sprung on me ! PAYNE ( to Beppo ) . I 'm sorry as hell it 's worked out like this ! It 's a lousy introduction to a son-in-law ! BEPPO Perhaps now that the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! PAYNE I wish I could do more than say I 'm sorry ! I know what a load of grief this is to you !  --  But thanks for sticking by me !  --  Thanks a lot , all of you ! BEPPO It was n't on your account , and you know it ! PAYNE Well , it 's just been one of those things ! BEPPO It 's just been one of those things that decent people do n't tolerate ! PAYNE ( finally nettled and turning on Beppo , though still with considerable restraint in his tone  --  his hand in his pocket again ) . Are you absolutely certain of that ? It seems to me you decent people have always been willing to tolerate a lot ! Suppose I had been responsible for this  --  suppose I did send killers after my rivals  --  suppose I did put all the swelled-headed , half-witted , half-hearted hoodlums who try to carry on a business they 're not fit for , where they ca n't obstruct the traffic any more  --  why , I 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business has done !  --  p. 97 MIMI Why , yes ! the Standard Oil people used to send gangs of thugs to beat up the other companies that were trying to put through independent pipelines  --  and the rail-road owners used to send men with brass knuckles to intimidate stockholders ' meetings !  --  it 's all in the history we have at school ! CHET Go-Good H-Heavens , are those things in the history books now ? They 're classical occurrences , then , and we d-do n't need to worry about them ! PAYNE Why , sure : you do n't worry today about all those unsuccessful contestants that took nose-dives out of hotel windows  --  and I 'll bet that every person here has got some little stocks and bonds that are the babies of the big dealers that put them under ! You can dress right and enjoy the good things of life because of the way they built up their businesses . But when we liquor men do just the same thing , you complain about our brutal methods ! CHET There 's s-something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be taking a load off your minds .  --  Thanks a lot again . Goodby . MIMI Wo n't you run into the police outside ? PAYNE You look out into the hall , and if it 's clear , I can take the elevator down and go out the side entrance . p. 98 MIMI But what about Bostock 's own detectives ? They must know what 's going on ! PAYNE They wo n't do anything about it . They 've known he was finished a long time . They know I 'm the big shot here now . Some of them are on my pay-roll.  --  Well , good night , folks ! LONGBROKE ( coming over to him just as he is about to go out ) . I say : it was awfully swell of you to ask me on your yachting party . I 'll try to make it . Where shall I meet you ? PAYNE Come to my office at three . I 'll drive you out to the boat . Pleased as hell you can come ! LONGBROKE KO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , and Mimi follows him . BEPPO ( to Mimi ) . Where are you going ? MIMI I 'm coming back . She goes out after Payne . LONGBROKE So this is American racketeering ! BETH Yes : it gets less and less like a crook play every minute ! LONGBROKE ( to Beth ) . I say : you wo n't think me very rude if I do n't come to the party Saturday . It 's a question of a business opening that I really must n't let slip . p. 99 BETH Not a bit , you big Huntley-and-Palmer animal cracker ! I was giving the party for you , but maybe we 'd get along better without you ! LONGBROKE I 'm frightfully sorry , but it 's really important ! BETH I 'll bet those buck-teeth of yours are bogus , too ! I can see them wobble when you talk ! LONGBROKE I must get the bridge fastened more securely . BETH Well , I must get back to my patient !  --  Come on , Dr. Tinker  --  the iodine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , followed by Dr. Tinker . CHET ( shaking his head ) . The end of the jazz age  --  Gee Whiz ! this is what it was all leading up to ! Mimi comes back . CHARLOTTE Well , Beppo , it 's really time we went ! BEPPO Under the circumstances I wo n't urge you to stay . CHET W-We 've really had an awfully good time , though  --  I have n't been to anything so exciting since the Quat'z-Arts Ball ten years ago  --  but you 've had enough to cope with tonight  --  and  --  and  --  BEPPO You wo n't have a drink before you go ? p. 100 CHET No , thanks , old man  --  we 'll clear out ! And d-do n't answer any more bells ! CHARLOTTE Let 's hope we do n't all end up in court ! LONGBROKE I must say good night , too . BEPPO Sorry it turned out such a ghastly evening ! LONGBROKE I found it most rewarding . They shake hands and go out through the hall . JUNE Maybe I better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please stay ! I need you ! JUNE ( wanting to leave him alone with Mimi ) . I 'll go in and see if I can help . She goes into the library . MIMI I 'm terribly sorry , Dad ! I know you 're furious with me , but I thought it would really be better to get married and tell you afterwards than to try to talk you into it ! BEPPO Have n't I always been fair and sympathetic with you ? MIMI Yes , Daddy : you have  --  but I felt you would n't want me to get married  --  you never seemed to like the idea of my being seriously interested in anybody . BEPPO I wanted you to use some discrimination ! p. 101 MIMI What 's the matter with Jack , Dad ? There 's a lot to him besides being a big liquor dealer  --  and anyway you approve of liquor  --  I 've heard you say that bootleggers were public benefactors . BEPPO You do n't know what he is ! MIMI Yes , I do , Dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he 's a member of the civilized minoriry that you 're always talking about ! BEPPO This is all the good it 's done you to send you to Miss French 's school ! MIMI But what I 'm supposed to get there is just what Jack needs . What 's the good of social case and so forth if it does n't make life easier for other people ? That 's one thing I can do for Jack  --  BEPPO You ca n't make a gentleman out of a mucker ! MIMI As long as you refuse to understand what Jack is really like , I do n't see it 's any use for me to talk to you . You and your friends are so snooty about Jack , but he 's done as much to be proud of as any of you ! When he was a boy , he was n't very well off and had to work in a bowling-alley  --  and he had to have a lot of brains and nerve to get where he is now . He had to battle his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scum of the underworld and the corrupt police officials and everybody : he 's been shot at five times  --  he 's the most daring person I 've ever known ! And now Jack is in a position where he can control this whole section of the city , and he 's trying to clean it up . If it was n't for Jack 's controlling it , there 'd be twice as much crime as there is ! He 's taken the criminal types that used to be pickpockets and gunmen and set them to making beer and distilling and driving trucks  --  and you know you think beer is a good thing ! I ca n't see that the kind of lives that people like the Chiveses , for instance , live , gives them any right to high-hat Jack ! Chet Chives is awfully sweet , but he does n't know what it 's all about  --  I do n't believe that Chet Chives has ever had his life in danger once ! And as for these little college brats with their noses still practically wet who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more exciting in their lives than play football and hockey , if that ! And the dear old college football team looks like a kindergarten romp when you put it beside what a man 's up against when he 's fighting the New York racketeers ! p. 102 BEPPO But this man is a racketeer himself !  --  your ideas are all topsy-turvy ! It 's your mother coming out in you : she always liked bums ! MIMI I wish you would n't talk about Mother like that ! I 'm just as fond of her as I am of you  --  though I know you do n't want me to be ! She 's always been awfully sweet , and I do n't think she drinks any more than you do ! BEPPO I do n't want you to think  --   --  MIMI Sometimes Mother and I get together and we kid the pants off you , Dad ! BEPPO I do n't want you to think that I do n't  --   --  MIMI I do n't see why you left her the way you did ! BEPPO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't we ? Why should we have to pretend that Mother does n't exist ? BEPPO I just do n't want to pretend she does n't exist  --   --  MIMI Yes , you do ! BEPPO I just do n't want you to accept all her standards  --   --  MIMI If you wanted to influence the situation , why did n't you stick with her in the first place ? p. 103 BEPPO We could n't get along  --  I 've tried to tell you  --  life had become impossible  --   --  MIMI Well , you 've done your best to tear me in two between you ! ( She begins to cry. )  --  And you talk about your standards , Dad  --  but I do n't think you know what you want yourself  --  sometimes you say you want money and society and just to know smart people , and other times you want to reform things !  --  BEPPO Do I ? I suppose I do . I do get confused . Do n't cry  --   --  MIMI And I 'm going to have a life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between what you want me to do and what Mother wants me to do ! I 'm going away with Jack tonight  --  I 'd made up my mind to do it anyway  --  that 's why I brought him back here . I 'm going to have a home of my own !  --  I 'm going to live with just one person ! BEPPO My dear , please do n't cry  --  I 'm so sorry  --  I do see how you feel  --  MIMI It 'll be a load off you anyway  --  you know you do n't want to do that funny-strip , and with me off your hands you wo n't have to !  --  BEPPO Listen , darling : working for things for you has been the only thing that 's kept me going !  --  p. 104 MIMI Oh , Dad , you know how fond of you I am , and I hate going away and leaving you like this !  --  BEPPO Why do n't you just wait a few days  --  we can talk about it a little more soberly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack I would . ( Getting up ) I 'm going now ! I 'm going up and pack . She starts for the stairs . BEPPO All right , but see here : why do n't you put off the actual trip . It may look bad , his going away just now . Why do n't you both stay in town ? MIMI No : I promised him . I have to  --  and I want to . You would n't want me to be a coward ! She starts upstairs . BEPPO ( breaking out ) . You do n't know the risks you 're taking !  --  and I wo n't allow you to take them ! If you try to go away with Payne , I 'll turn him over to the police tonight ! MIMI ( on the stairs ) . Is this behaving like a " civilized person , " Dad ? She goes up to her room . Dr. Tinker appears from the library . DR . TINKER I do n't want to intrude , but I could n't help hearing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These relations between father and daughter may become very serious problems , and it 's important to analyze them in time  --   --  p. 105 BEPPO In time ? But it 's done ! it 's already done !  --  and the only thing I can do is to say to myself  --  why have I let it happen ? Why have I made myself such a life ? Why have I forced her to live it ? Mimi slips out of her room , with a bag and in a coat and hat , and goes quickly along the upstairs hall . DR . TINKER That conviction of guilt is neurotic  --  you must try to realize that you 're not to blame for everything that  --   --  BEPPO ( looking up at the sound of Mimi darting out the upstairs door ) . Was that Mimi ? ( He rushes to the stairs , sees her door open and calls ) @x Beppo and June on the sofa . Except for the floor-lamp , the stage is dark . Whisky on the table . JUNE Feel better ? BEPPO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more tonight ! BEPPO I 'm all right  --  thanks to you , my dear  --  you 're the only thing now I 've got left  --   --  JUNE Do n't say that ! BEPPO But it 's true : I know now I 'm completely alone  --  this whole thing does n't hang together  --  people do n't mean anything to each other any more . I 've been trying to tell myself for years that there was some kind of sense to the life I live , but I know now it 's just a crazy party with everybody talking about themselves , and the only way we 're able to stand each other is for all of us to get plastered together so that nobody pays any attention to what anybody else is saying . I could n't even make my daughter believe in it !  --  And you 're the only real and human thing I 've got ! JUNE You 've got plenty of girl-friends besides me ! BEPPO Not real girls , though , like you . You make me feel I 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 107 JUNE What was the matter with all the others ? BEPPO They 're not real women ! Look at Charlotte Chives !  --  look at Beth Badger ! Charlotte wants to boss everybody , and she never gives a man an even break  --  and Beth is more or less the same way , and she 's one of these impossible modern girls who refuses to be an old-fashioned wife and yet at the same time hates like hell to work for her own living and earn her right to dodge domestic responsibility . But you  --  you earn your own living  --  you 're a little free-swimming organism  --  and yet you manage to be a real woman . You 're not even stuck on yourself because you can play the piano , whereas Beth who does nothing with her brains , carries on like a prima donna ! JUNE I never got a chance to be stuck on myself . There were seventeen in my family , and I was at the bottom of the heap . I had sixteen brothers and sisters to pick on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and I was an only son . All of us people who come from families where there were only a few children or one and who had a lot of fuss made over us as kids are still trying to have the world revolve around us , whereas you knew damn well from the start that you had to do the revolving .  --  And Mimi , too  --  she 's spoiled : all her life her mother and I have been competing for her affection , and now she 's come to believe that she 's a very important person and that everybody ought to give in to her  --  but with you it 's natural for you to be considerate  --  you 're modest and sweet to everybody , because you know that human beings are really very small in the world and that we 're all in the same little boat .  --  Tell me , my dear : do you love me at all ? p. 108 JUNE Of course . ( Squeezing his hand ) But I would n't want to love anybody again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were crazy about him , were n't you ? JUNE I do n't know why I was , but I was  --  the dirty bum ! ( She laughs . ) He was absolutely nuts ! BEPPO ( hopefully ) . I suppose he really was mentally defective , was n't he ? JUNE He was one of the smartest guys you ever saw , but the things he did were crazy . He got fancy ideas about living in style as soon as he cleaned up a little money in Brooklyn , and he insisted on coming over to Manhattan and taking a big apartment in the Fifties . He had it specially decorated by one of these interior decorators  --  just like you 're doing with this  --   --  BEPPO ( with a displeased smile ) . O ! really ? JUNE Yes , he had it all done in the Empire Style with green-satin-covered furniture and G for Gammel  --  that was his last name , Al Gammel  --  on the curtains and the bedspreads and everything . And mirrors !  --  the whole bedroom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mirror on the ceiling !  --  You can imagine what that was for ! ( Beppo smiles wanly . ) And we were pie-eyed every night ! Every night we 'd stay up later and later till finally we got so we did n't get up till five in the afternoon . p. 109 BEPPO ( without enthusiasm ) . That must have been a lot of fun . JUNE Some days we 'd never get dressed at all  --  Al had purple pyjamas with lilac frogs on them  --  I was ashamed ovum at first !  --  the only times we ever went out were to speakeasies and night-clubs and shows  --  I 'd never been to a real show before I married Al  --  and that was all we did for months . I used to get the meals  --  Al wanted to have a cook and a butler , but I would n't lettum  --  I thought it was too much of a waste . I used to play jazz to-um after dinner , and then he 'd turn on the phonograph and make me dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that time we 'd be good and pie-eyed and he 'd tell me how much he loved me.  --  ( Giggling ) What we did n't do in that apartment ! Beppo , who has been looking crestfallen , pours himself another drink . JUNE ( looking at the drink , preventively ) . Oh  --  oh ! BEPPO It 's all right : I 'm past the peak  --  I 'm tapering off now .  --  My dear , you fill me with envy !  --  I do n't believe I 've ever known what it was to love and be loved like that  --  to forget the world completely and not to care about anything but one another ! I 've always been too much of an egoist to lose myself in the other person  --  I 've always wanted to put on a show , have the woman admire my personality . p. 110 JUNE Did n't Al want to be admired ! BEPPO Yes , but I 've always picked out women who wanted to be admired , too  --  who wanted to put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't last long , because each one is always trying to push the other one out into the audience and make him ot her sit back and behave himself , and not criticize , and like it  --  and then the person that gets shoved into the audience oftenest finally becomes disgusted and walks out on the person that 's giving the show .  --  That 's what 's always happened with me in the past  --  but I feel that it might perhaps be different with you  --  that with you love might make me forget myself . JUNE I would n't want to do what I did with Al again : we were like two animals in a cage . We did a lot of fighting , too  --  especially when Al was spending money and was drinking so he could'n work and the landlord was after us for the rent . Al beat me up one night because I toldum he ought to be working , and the next day be brought a woman home and that made me sore , and then I got a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant he had , and then Al got sore because he thought I was unfaithful to-um with this friend , and he twisted my wrist so I could'n play , and then we got put out of the apartment . I moved in with a girl-friend . Al had been away two nights , and I did'n even leavum word where I was . p. 111 BEPPO Do you know where Al is now ? JUNE I have n't seenum for a year  --  he used to come around and make me givum money  --  the last time I sawum , he told me he still loved me and wanted me to go back withum , but he 'd started taking dope then , and I tried going back withum once , and it was the same thing over again , only worse , so I toldum I did'n want to seeum no more , and he went away , and I have n't seenum since . The door-bell rings . BEPPO ( starting ) . Good God ! and I thought things had quieted down ! This place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dining-room and goes to open the door . JUNE What about your Mr. Gibbs ?  --  were n't you still expecting him ? BEPPO Yes  --  or it might be the doctor to ship Bostock out . Dr. Tinker comes in , followed by a bell-boy carrying a stretcher . Chang waits for orders . DR . TINKER Well , how is he getting along ? BEPPO All right , apparently . The nurse is in there . DR . TINKER And how are you ? BEPPO Quite all right ! p. 112 DR . TINKER Look out for the downgrade on those drinks ! BEPPO Just a small one and the last . DR . TINKER Well , let 's see if we ca n't move him . BEPPO Fine ! All except June go into the library . She lights a cigarette and looks toward the library door . Immediately Bostock 's voice is heard , talking with animation . BOSTOCK 'S VOICE Hello , Doc ! Perfectly splendid ! Just one little shot to pick me up ! That 's fine  --  I 'll be absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  I 'm perfectly well able to walk !  --  Just been lying around here waiting for you to give me my marching orders ! All right ! I can do it myself ! All right , have it your own way ! I 'll be a babe in arms if you say so ! DR . TINKER 'S VOICE You must sit upright so as not to start it bleeding . BOSTOCK 'S VOICE All right ! You bet I 'll sit upright ! That 's glorious ! Now on with the procession ! The bell-boy and Chang carry Bostock in on the stretcher . Dr. Tinker , the Nurse and Beppo following . Bostock is sitting up with a dressing-gown around his shoulders and a blankes over his legs . He is deathly pale now , and the circles around his eyes look darker . BOSTOCK Stop a minute ! Slaves , stop the litter ! Caesar must thank his good host ! ( They stop , and Bostock shakes hands with Beppo with his free left hand . ) I must say goodby and apologize again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lousy mess I 've caused tonight ! p. 113 BEPPO I 'm only sorry on your account . BOSTOCK But I 'm as fit as a fiddle ! It 'll take a good deal more than a bullet or two to put Luke Bostock out of business ! It 's the old pioneer stock ! The old pioneer spirit ! The Indians could n't kill us in the early days , and the gunmen ca n't get us today !  --  and it 's the old pioneer spirit that we 'll have to fall back on now !  --  I hope your people were pioneers , Mr. Miles  --  I hope they battled with the wolves  --  and the wildcats  --  and  --  and  --  those other wild animals !  --  I hope that your grandfather was one of those who builded his own house with his own hands  --  with his ax and his hammer and his chisel  --  and his  --  and his other tools  --  that we other builders who come after him might erect vaster mansions for America  --  great comfort-happy chromium palaces with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's what I 'm going to have next summer , a ticker in every bathroom !  --  and there 's going to be good news on it , too !  --  and the thing that 's going to pull us through is the old pioneer spirit !  --   --  DR . TINKER Do n't tire yourself ! You 'd better be getting along  --  that hypodermic has got to last you . They start carrying him again . BOSTOCK That 's all right ! I 'm solid as hickory !  --  Goodby , Mr. Miles , and thanks again !  --  Remember that the old pioneer spirit is what 'll put us back on top of the world !  --  Forward in the covered wagon !  --  there are no black hangings on this covered wagon ! This covered wagon is no hearse ! ( They carry him out through the hallway , and his voice is still heard holding forth . ) The old pioneer spirit !  --  p. 114 The Nurse and Dr. Tinker follow them out . BEPPO ( to June ) . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes over to the sofa and kisses her and picks up his drink again . ) What a blessed relief it is to be alone with you , my dear , at last ! JUNE Is n't Miss Badger still in there ? She was looking after him . BEPPO She went , I 'm sure . I did n't see her go , but I remember she said goodby to me when the nurse came . ( He opens the library door . ) Yes , she 's gone  --  Oh , Beth !  --  Yes , she 's gone . ( He shuts the door again and is coming back to the sofa when two shots are heard outside . He stops short in dismay . ) Good God ! Again ? ( He pauses and listens : sounds of shouts and people running outside . ) Have we got to go through all this again ? I really do n't think I can stand it ! ( Chang bursts in . ) Well , did they get him this time , Chang ? CHANG The gunman was inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shot at Mr. Bostock . I go for towels . BEPPO Why do n't you use his this time ? CHANG ( smiling ) . I am afraid of Mr. Bostock 's apartment . p. 115 He goes out through the dining-room door . BEPPO Poor bozo ! He 's evidently doomed . JUNE It must have been terrible forum hanging around like that and knowing he was going to get it ! I suppose that 's why he did so much talking  --  he was trying to keep his mind off it . BEPPO Just like all the rest of us , eh ? BEPPO They do n't need me in there , do they , Chang ? There 's nothing I can do , is there ? CHANG No : there are plenty of people . He goes out through the hall . Beppo subsides onto the couch . BEPPO I need medical attention myself  --  I 'm groggy ! I 've got an acute pain in the back of my head . I can hardly hold this glass . Be sweet to me  --  soothe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go ! You sit there . He sits looking apprehensively toward the hallway . Two policemen appear with Al Gammel . June comes in behind them and , while the conversation that follows is going on , stands petrified , gazing at Al . POLICEMAN We caught this bird on the fire-escape . Can you identify him as the man you saw ? p. 116 BEPPO ( nervous and flustered ) . Why , no  --  I ca n't say I do identify him  --   --  JUNE The other man was short and stocky . BEPPO Yes : he seemed shorter than this man  --  and broader .  --  Did you find a gun on him ? POLICEMAN No : the gun was found in the apartment . Could you be sure this was n't the man you saw ? BEPPO Well , it 's hard to be absolutely sure  --  I saw him only for a second and not distinctly  --  but he seemed to me to be wearing a darker suit  --   --  POLICEMAN Well , he was caught on the fire-escape outside of Bostock 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story is . BEPPO Let me know if there 's anything I can do to help you . POLICEMAN O.K. They go out , leading Al . JUNE ( in a low voice ) . My God , that was Al ! BEPPO What ? JUNE That was my husband . BEPPO Really ? Good Heavens ! Well , that makes things worse than ever ! p. 117 JUNE So he 's a gunman now ! Poor Al ! ( She laughs sadly . ) No wonder he missedum so many times ! BEPPO Do n't tell them you know anything about him and maybe they wo n't find out . JUNE I wonder if they 'd let me see-um . BEPPO For Heaven 's sake , do n't try to do that ! We 're badly enough mixed up in it as it is . If they find out that this man worked for Payne and that Payne has married Mimi and that you were married to Al , they may accuse us of luring Bostock in here to kill him ! JUNE He looked like he was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Chang comes back . BEPPO Was it fatal this time , Chang ? CHANG They seem to have attained their objective . He goes out through the dining-room . BEPPO God , if he 's actually dead , we may all be in a hell of a mess ! JUNE Al can get the chair ! The crazy fool ! he has n't got the nerve for a gunman . That was always the trouble withum  --  he was smart but he did n't have the guts  --  he used to get scared sick the night before he had to move a load of liquor . He used to wake up in the night with the horrors , and he 'd make me put my arms aroundum before he could get to sleep again . That was why he started taking dope , I guess . Poor Al ! He used to talk like he was going to own the world  --  he was going to control all the liquor in Brooklyn , to listen to-um . And now he 's just another mug ! p. 118 BEPPO Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just write to-um and wo n't sign my name  --  and sendum some money for prison . If you have n't got money , you 're out of luck , because you are n't able to buy anything , and the prison food is terrible . BEPPO Better disguise your handwriting . JUNE I wonder if I ought to have takenum back the last time he wanted me to . He said he 'd be a good boy . I feel terrible to see-um like this ! BEPPO You must n't blame yourself , my dear . You ca n't change other people 's characters . JUNE I do n't know  --  he said if I 'd take-um back , he 'd be a good boy and would n't drink no more . He shot at-um three times : he wanted to prove to-umself he could do it ! BEPPO You love him still , do n't you ? JUNE Maybe I do . BEPPO You do n't really care for me ! JUNE Oh , yes , I do , but you know : the first person you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes out every night after he first left me  --  but I would'n wantum back now  --  it makes me feel terrible to think I do n't like-um after the way we loved each other ! p. 119 BEPPO I know  --  I understand , my dear . ( He takes her hand . ) But life is very unjust  --  the world was n't made for sensitive people . It was n't made so that we could have the people we love , and it was n't made so that they should deserve our loving them . The world is a sad , sad place , and there 's nothing we can do about it  --  if we want to keep on at all , we have to try to forget how sad it is and enjoy the few good things while they last . For me , my dear , you 're one of the few really fine and beautiful and marvelous things in the world  --  I know I 'm not that for you , but  --  JUNE It 's just that it 's made me feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking aboutum !  --  They beat them up terrible at the station-house . I saw him after they 'd beaten him up before when he was arrested for stealing a car , and they 'd flogged him with the hose and put pins under his nails and broke his jaw  --  and they would n't have a doctor to do anything forum .  --  Well , I 'd better be going . ( She looks at the clock . ) Good Lord ! it 's quarter to four . ( She gets up , fixing her hair . ) I must go ! BEPPO ( taken aback and feeling miffed ) . Why do n't you stay here ? It 's so late . Mimi 's gone , and I 'm all alone . p. 120 JUNE Not tonight : I want to go home tonight  --  I 'm all worn out and upset . BEPPO So am I  --  so why do n't you stay , and we can console one another ? JUNE I 'd only make you bluer ! ( She kisses him . ) Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rich , what do you care ? He wo n't get caught for this . BEPPO He 's just what Al wanted to be , I suppose . JUNE Poor Al , he would have enjoyed it if he 'd had it ! BEPPO We all would  --  it 's what I wanted , too  --  but I do n't give a damn about it now !  --  ( A little bitterly ) Well , you 're leaving me , are you ? JUNE I must . BEPPO To go away and think of Al !  --  I imagined I had a little palace here , where my friends and Mimi and I could admire ourselves and make fun of the world . But the world is Payne and his kind  --  they 're the real masters of the palace  --  and tonight they 've knocked down my door and taken my daughter away ! And even you  --  I thought you belonged to me as no other woman ever had  --  but you belong to them , too ! JUNE Do n't talk like that ! I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the reality for you  --  not anything I 've got here ! JUNE I love it here ( she kisses him ) , but I do n't want to stay tonight . You go and get some sleep  --  you 're tired ! BEPPO I wo n't sleep  --  probably wo n't for weeks ! JUNE Why do n't you take some luminol ? ( Kissing him again ) Good night  --  do n't worry now ! He leads her toward the hall . JUNE Do n't come with me !  --  I 'll get a taxi ! They go out into the hall . Chung comes in from the dining-room . He wears bonerimmed spectacles like Chang , but is elderly and has gray hair . He collects the ash-trays and glasses and carries them out on a tray . Beppo returns and picks up the newspaper , holding it with shaking hands . Chung returns for another load . BEPPO ( reading aloud ) . " Ruffles will Remedy Starvation : American propaganda undertaken to make the Jap women wear cotton ruffles on their panties is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hokus P. Bong of Georgia , arriving on the Germania yesterday . "  --  ( Bursting out with nervous irritation ) Good God , I believe it 's actually true that the racketeers might run the country better than this government we 've got !  --  What would you Communists say to that ? p. 122 CHUNG Your statement , as we should analyze it , presents a dual aspect : it has a positive and a  --   --  BEPPO ( looking up startled at the sound of his voice ) . I do n't remember engaging you ! CHUNG Chang is preparing a thesis . I take his place . My name is Chung . BEPPO I see  --  and you can carry on the argument without the slightest break ? CHUNG ( smiling ) . It is the Party analysis . Your statement , as I was saying , presents a dual aspect : it has a positive aspect and a negative aspect . The positive aspect of your statement is the contempt it shows for bourgeois institutions . We call this the positive aspect because it shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any confidence in their own puppet representatives . But your remark presents also a negative aspect : it is negative , according to our analysis , that the general crises of capitalism should be to you merely an occasion for cynicism . It is negative from our point of view that , despairing of bourgeois institutions , you should not have taken the further step of understanding that these must be superseded and that your interests as a bourgeois technician  --   --  BEPPO ( stung ) . I may be a technician , but I 'm damned if I 'm bourgeois ! p. 123 CHUNG ( smiling ) . I speak in terms of Marxist analysis , with no personal implication . I was saying that as the present crisis deepens , the technician who has been hitherto dependent on employment by the bourgeoisie , will find himself expropriated and forced down to the ranks of the proletariat , and that he should recognize his true solidarity with  --   --  BEPPO Well , it 's a matter of opinion , is n't it ?  --  Thank you for substituting for Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( As Chung begins piling the things on the tray ) Do n't clear away all those things  --  leave the bottle and the White Rock and a glass , please .  --  ( He goes over and mixes himself a drink ) Do n't you Communists ever do any drinking ? CHUNG ( smiling ) . We have to keep ourselves in training . BEPPO Good God ! I have gangsters on one side and Communists on the other ! ( Chung smiles. )  --  As you say , where do people like me come in ? But are people really better off in Russia where they 're all supposed to be working together for the same great common ideal ? Somebody who 'd been over there lately was telling me the other day about a girl who 'd been given a job as rat-catcher . She was pleased and proud with the job because she was catching rats for the Soviets  --  she would diligently go to the library and look up all the books on rat-catching , and she 'd started studying German to find out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant over catching rats ! And that 's something  --  I admit it !  --  to feel the conviction that what you 're doing is for something and somebody beyond yourself . But , damn it , I do n't want to catch rats ! I 'm not a peasant ! I 'm a civilized modern person who likes a civilized life !  --  And the way they butchered the Tsar and his family !  --  and the way they 've embalmed Lenin and have the yokels lining up to look at him !  --  No : the whole thing 's distasteful ! ( Chung smiles. )  --  And those godawful names they concoct by tacking the first syllables of words together ! p. 124 CHUNG To take up the first of your objections  --   --  BEPPO No : do n't explain , please ! I 'm not equal to an argument tonight .  --  You can take the rest of these things out . ( Chung takes the tray and starts for the door . Beppo lifts his glass and looks at it , then stops Chung just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : stay a minute  --  put down the tray ! ( Chung sets the tray on the table . ) I 'm alone here  --  completely alone ! I 'm going to take this drink so that I 'll feel there is somebody with me  --  myself !  --  This drink will make me double up , and then I 'll be able to admire myself , console myself , pat myself on the back  --  I 'll feel like my own best buddy ! ( Chung smiles . ) And then in the morning when I come to again  --  instead of being the life of the party in my own congenial company  --  I 'll be less than one human being !  --  Do you understand what I mean ?  --  I 'll be absolutely crazy !  --  I 've been under a terrible strain . I think I 'm going crazy anyway !  --  and there 's no use just stalling it off with drink ! ( In a sudden outbreak of nerves , he throws the glass against the wainscoting and smashes it . ) There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chung smiles . ) Face the situation without liquor and ask yourself , squarely : So what ? In the first place , nothing 's a satisfaction , and it takes all the drinks you can hold to pretend to yourself that it is !  --  When you 're out there in Galesburg , Illinois , you want to go on to Chicago ; then when you get to Chicago , you want to go on to New York . Then when you make good in New York , what in God 's name , have you got ? The thoroughly depressing companionship of a lot of poor small-towners like yourself who do n't know what the hell to do with themselves either ! ( Chung smiles . ) You think it would be better in Paris , but then when you get to Paris , you find the same old fizzed-out people , and you decide that they 're worse than the ones at home , because they have n't got even their small-town background to make fools of themselves against . You think you want to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home by satirizing the things you abominate  --  you think maybe it 's exciting over there , you think it must be going somewhere , you want to see what 's happened .  --  But then when you get back and see your friends , you find that nothing has happened  --  the people are still milling around in the same unsatisfactory apartments , just as unsettled as ever , still just moving in or just moving out , still trying to make up their minds whether they want to get divorced or stay married , still eternally behind themselves , though you never can tell what they 're trying to catch up to , their ideals or their standards of living ! ( Chung smiles. )  --  And your homecoming 's no more of an event than if you 'd just been away to the toilet !  --  And as for satirizing America , the whole thing 's so goddam hopeless and stupid that your little jokes seem pathetic !  --  Then you run into some new girl , and for a time you think you 'd be really happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes  --  and then when you finally succeed , there you are alone again !  --  What you thought would be a fine new experience that would take you out of yourself is just another set of sexual organs  --  the same set you 've known all along  --  you 've mastered their topography so thoroughly that they seem just about as romantic as the Lexington Avenue subway !  --  And so , as you say , what am I ? Not an artist ! not a solid citizen ! I 'm outside that natural world that the other people belong to  --  if there really is any such world  --  most of my friends , so far as I can see , are just as badly off as I am  --  they 're not part of anything either  --  I know it when I look into their faces  --  I see the same solitude , the same insecurity , the same straining for something to hang on to ! You at least have an idea that 's big , but I have to keep myself going with things that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of a new revue , seeing an amusing friend , buying a new picture  --  I have to get myself from one to the other like Eliza crossing the ice , with panic and desperation always just a few jumps behind me !  --  And even things like that I ca n't depend on : I 'm always made jittery by the feeling that the party or the picture or the show may suddenly give way underneath me !  --  and they always turn out disappointing !  --  Even wearing these purple evening clothes has n't braced me up as much as I hoped ! And on the other hand , any little incident that 's actively disagreeable  --  no matter how intrinsically silly it may be  --  can sink me down to the depths !  --  That senator and his ruffles , for instance  --  it made the whole world , all of a sudden , seem too drivelingly half-witted to live in !  --  or remembering an appointment with the dentist  --  I 've got one tomorrow . as a matter of fact  --  and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! is fighting through one 's life  --  day by day , minute by minute  --  is it worth the effort and the agony it takes ?  --  As soon as I 'm alone in the evening , this horrible depression comes down on me  --  that 's why I have so many people in  --  but it does n't make any difference : I 'm alone ! I 'm alone ! I 'm alone !  --  my daughter and my girl have both left me  --  I did n't have anything to give them !  --  and I 've driven three wives away !  --  It 's all my fault !  --  I know it  --  it 's me , not them !  --  and now the devils of the mind have come for me just the way the gunmen came for Bostock !  --  We 're all sitting alone scared to death in unsatisfactory apartments ! ( Chung smiles . ) Do n't laugh ! It 's insanity I 'm close to ! I 'm outside it all , all the time !  --  All these things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  I thought I was going to get a kick out of those highball glasses I bought in Venice  --  I had them sent over here , and now they 're even further away from me than they were before I saw them in the shop !  --  they 're things that other people have drinks out of !  --  and I hate them ! ( He smashes another glass. )  --  I hate it all  --  everybody , everything !  --  it all has no relation to me ! Who are you ? I do n't even know you  --  you might be something I 'd had sent in from Vantine 's !  --  But I hate myself , too !  --  that 's not me either !  --  I see myself doing things , hear my voice saying things , and that belongs to that outside world , too !  --  My work even  --  it 's not me who does it  --  it 's like sitting behind a partition and working the automatic chess-player in one of those old waxwork shows !  --  it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic little tigers for Herman Godbrow Gibbs !  --  it 'll only be an empty doll with no mind and no will of its own  --  without even any appetites left to want the things that killing my self-respect will buy me !  --  And when things have got to that point , it 's time to put an end to the whole affair !  --  As soon as you go out of this room , I 'll be left here at the mercy of something : I 'll have to obey the compulsion that 's pulling me over to that table !  --  wherever that gun is , I feel it  --  there 's a pricking around it like a magnetic field !  --  If it 's in the little drawer of that table , I try to keep away from the table  --  but tonight it 's lying right there in front of me  --  this is the hour that 's been waiting for me !  --  As you say , I 'm a contemptible parasite ! A cheap ham ! A selfish ass ! A case of arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do to prove I 'm enough of a person to know it ! p. 125 He picks up the revolver from the table and dashes toward the library door ; but the door suddenly opens and discloses Beth , very pale , with her hand at her throat . Beppo stops short . BEPPO Why , Beth ?  --  What 's the matter ? BETH I 'm all right ! She comes in and sinks down on the couch . BEPPO What 's happened to you ? Did you faint ? BETH I 'm frightfully sorry , Beppo  --  I did n't get enough to do the trick , I guess . BEPPO Good Heavens ! What did you do ? BETH Just the old manic depression . Life suddenly seemed just too horrible , so I grabbed the doctor 's iodine ! BEPPO You drank it ? ( Beth nods . ) Where ? in the bathroom ? ( She nods . ) I 'll get a doctor ! BETH No , do n't : I 'm all right . The bottle was n't full . It just makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone ) . I 'd rather have a doctor see you  --   --  BETH No , do n't ! I could n't bear one . The only thing they do , anyway , is tell you to eat starch . I was with Francie Fernald when she drank it . Are there any of those boiled potatoes left from dinner ? If there are , just give me one . That 's all a doctor could do ! p. 126 BEPPO ( to Chung ) . Go get those potatoes . Chung goes out through the dining-room . BETH I 'm sorry I behaved so disgracefully  --  just when you were having such a crisis , too ! BEPPO What was the matter , my dear ?  --  Do you feel all right inside ?  --  are you sure ? BETH Yes : I 'm much better since I vomited . If we could only puke up experience ! BEPPO What was the matter ? tell me ! BETH The matter is I 'm going mad ! Chung returns with a plate of potatoes , salt and pepper and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you . ( She begins eating one with her fingers . ) I 'll be all right now ! BEPPO Do n't you want something else ? BETH No , thanks  --  nothing at all . BEPPO ( to Chung ) . All right : that 's all . Chung goes out . BEPPO You must n't let Ada Force get your goat ! BETH It 's not only that  --  it 's everything ! It came over me so I could n't bear it how I 'd always been such a bitch to everybody who 'd ever cared about me  --  first you and then Chet  --  only to let myself be given the gate by that son of a bitch of an Englishman ! It was all too complete , with you and Chet both here  --  it was too much , the final defeat ( laughing and crying ) on the scene of my former failures !  --  And then the nurse  --  it braced me up for awhile to pretend to be a trained nurse for Bostock , but then the real nurse came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't needed  --  and I felt so utterly useless !  --  p. 127 BEPPO You must n't feel that way , Beth !  --  everybody leans on you , do n't you know it ?  --  do n't you know how strong you are ?  --  do n't you know how much you give people ?  --  I got so dependent on you that that was really the reason I broke away , and I think now I was a damn fool to do it  --  I 've been at sea ever since ! BETH It was my fault  --  I 'm impossible  --  it 's me !  --  I 've got an impossible conflict ! My father was a sweet little man who liked to be gay and enjoy things , and I always fall for anybody who seems to be like him . But them mother comes into action and proceeds to hound the life out of father ! I begin to boss and scold just like her . I ca n't do anything about it  --  the psychoanalyst said so ! She drove my father insane , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm going insane , too ! BEPPO My dear , you do n't know what it is really to feel your mind giving way ! Do you know that I 've been suffering for months from what seems an irresistible impulse to take my clothes off in elevators ? BETH That 's nothing , dearie !  --  it 's all I can do to keep from smashing the Della Robbia cherubs over the heads of Ada Force 's customers ! BEPPO Do you ever have the feeling that your hands have come off ? p. 128 BETH I sometimes wear other people 's faces ! BEPPO ( standing up and talking excitedly ) . But why are we like that ? Why are we ? Because we really hate this world we live in ! Because there 's really nothing in it for us ! What 's the use of paying psychoanalysts for alibis to blame it on our parents ? It 's the whole thing we 're part of that 's washed up now ! There 's nothing behind it but graft and crime ! To a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BETH You were telling me a little while ago how much you admired the morality of June Macy and her gunman relations . If it 's cute for June to have stick-up men in the family , why is n't it even cuter for Mimi to marry Jack Payne ? BEPPO I know : our own world has so gone to hell that we think the underworld 's romantic .  --  Yet I try to bring June into my world . BETH That makes you a grand seigneur ! BEPPO And this is what I expect her to be dazzled by : this idiotic mess of an apartment !  --  this senseless collection of knick-knacks that I 've carried in here like a magpie !  --  the walls are n't even finished , and who the hell cares whether they 're ever finished ?  --  I do n't ! It 's not real ! it 's not beautiful !  --  Even those Periwinkos , to hell with them ! ( He rips one off the wall and throws it after the glasses. ) p. 129 BETH Do n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ! The bootlegger can buy better ones than I can  --  he can even buy my daughter and my guests with his yacht ! To hell with the yachts and the Periwinkos ! I wanted them all my life  --  my father had the great ambition to live in a big house in Galesburg with an iron stag on the lawn . He got his iron stag , and I 've got my bronze Venus . To hell with the bronze Venus ! He picks up a cushion from the sofa and is about to hurl it at the floor lamp when Beth jumps up and seizes it . BETH Do n't !  --  do n't wreck Venus ! Do n't be so hard on the old luxury furnishings ! BEPPO No : you were perfectly right  --  they look like an auction room ! I know it , yet I seem to have to have them . BETH Just like my country house . When I was a little girl , we lived in an enormous mansion with twenty welldisciplined servants and a picture of St. Francis feeding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved that you 're not going back to it with Longbroke.  --  When I first knew you years ago , you thought you were revolting against it . BETH It does seem a long time ago we were revolting ! p. 130 BEPPO Do you remember the P. L. M. Express ? My first finding you in that compartment is still one of the most exciting things in my life ! You were sitting there in your smart little dress with your little black eyes all snapping ! BETH I was reading a book by Cocteau . BEPPO I 'd never known a girl so insolent to life  --  the girls of my own age were n't like that . BETH You were only my second lover , and the first one had n't been good . BEPPO We went practically from the station to the bed . BETH In the middle of the afternoon  --  and then when we went outside , everything was dreamy and vague , and we got into that fantastic party in that cellar where they were drinking calvados . BEPPO How delighted with ourselves we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from everything we 'd hated at home ! BETH And look at us ! BEPPO Yes : how did we land here ?  --  Good Heavens when we were living in Paris , I thought that I was somebody in particular , but now in New York , I know dama well that I 'm nothing but a well-known name among a lot of other well-known names , where it 's the name that counts and not the work . What a lousy culture ! Good God !  --  no craftsmanship , no real ideas , no genuine integrity of the spirit ! We 're all just empty distracted people , hopping around , as my mother used to say , like a hen on a hot griddle ! p. 131 BETH When you go on like that , Beppo , you remind me of my own mother bawling out Papa for his frivolous life . BEPPO ( getting up again ) . Well , why should we be ashamed of our Puritanism , now that we 've broken then rules and only feel glummer than ever ? Our Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got . Why , in God 's name , do n't we protest instead of trying to drug ourselves like Bostock and going down with his rotten collapse ? BETH When you take to smashing Periwinkos , I suppose it 's the old ripsnorting Cromwellian righteousness knocking the spires off cathedrals ! BEPPO ( carried away ) . Wreck the cathedrals ! Why not ? Tear down all these trappings that hide the truth ! Let 's take our world for what it is ! Let 's take ourselves for what we are ! Tear down all the phony tapestries ! Let 's protest against ourselves ! ( He pulls the tapestry down , so that it falls on him and covers him up : he stands a moment enveloped in its folds . The door-bell begins to ring . He emerges , disheveled and looking foolish . A moment 's terrible silence . ) That must be Gibbs  --  I 'd forgotten about him ! ( He disengages himself from the tapestry and smooths his rumpled hair. ) p. 132 BETH Here , I 'll fold the tapestry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to answer it  --  to hell with him ! BETH You 'd better go  --  it 's your bread and butter !  --  BEPPO ( stopping her as she is trying to fold up the tapestry ) . No : to hell with it ! I 'm not going to answer it ! It 's either Gibbs or Bostock 's ghost , and they both mean the same old fake !  --  Beth , let 's get married again ! BETH Do n't be silly  --  answer that bell !  --  I 'll answer it , and you go and brush your hair . The door-bell rings with redoubled violence . She starts to go , but he stops her , takes her by both arms and holds her . BEPPO You wo n't answer it ! Marry me , Beth ! BETH So that we can finish each other off ! BEPPO Save each other ! BETH You 'll need Mr. Gibbs just the same ! BEPPO Mr. Gibbs would make life not worth saving !  --  You know it : it was always you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need you : we were always something more together than either of us could be by himself ! p. 133 BETH It 's all been destroyed now . BEPPO It ca n't be or I would n't feel the way I do  --  I would n't feel such awful twists at my heart every time I see you again !  --  Do n't you ever feel anything about me ? BETH I almost did this afternoon . BEPPO What did you feel ? BETH I do n't know : sadness , I guess . That was what made me sarcastic . I saw the little ash-trays we bought in Paris . BEPPO And every time we meet again like this and pretend to be sophisticated and formal , we 're murdering something we made . It must be real or it would n't rebel  --  it would n't hurt us so ! ( The door-bell gives one last prolonged ring : Beppo intensifies his eloquence . ) It must be the only thing real we 've got left  --  it 's the only thing that is n't selfconscious . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try to talk ourselves into . And that pain is all we 've got now for love . It 's still living , whether we want it or not  --  it 's still alive , in spite of everything . It means that we used to be happy together . BETH I used to be so horribly nasty ! BEPPO You used to make all the false part of me secrn false , and I could n't stand to be without it , so I went back to living with it . But now I 'm so disgusted with it that I 'd rather have you back and feel like a fool now and then ! You 've got me breaking my furniture already , you see ! p. 134 BETH I really like the ham in you , as Chet Chives says . I 'd never been the kind of girl that men get romantic about , and when you called me a " little brown maenad , " you thrilled me to the core . BEPPO I remember , and you said , " Do n't get literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kisses her. )
