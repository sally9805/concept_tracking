Modern and traditional architecture came slam-bang into dramatic contrast last week between the covers of LIFE . On eleven double-page spreads appeared eight plans for houses , four by " modern " ' architects arrayed against four by " traditional " ' architects , each pair designed to meet the needs and income of an actual U. S. family . By this presentation LIFE hoped : 1 ) to inform its readers of how easily any family earning from $2,000 to $10,000 a year can build an efficient , pleasant home ; 2 ) to poll its readers on the relative popularity of the two types of home building . <P> After researching four representative U.

" A walkaway for the moderns was provided by Frank Lloyd Wright 's design for the Blackbourn family of Minneapolis ( income $5,000 to $6,000 ) , which reduced the merit of Royal Barry Wills 's design to that of a safe investment . For the Smiths of Wyncote , Pa.
