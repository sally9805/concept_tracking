txt Pennsylvania seems destined to play one of the key roles in the 193s Congressional elections . It is not a " barometer " state in the sense that Ohio , for example , is so described . But like the sleepy town of Gettysburg just seventy-five years ago , it is a strategic area . To be brief , Pennsylvania Is a state In which the . Reiublican party almost certainly must stage a dramatic comeback U it is to =eke consequential gains in the House ' of Representatives for the 1939 omission of Congress . In 1936 Pennsylvania elected 2 ' / Democrats to the House , reducing what was only a few years ago an overwhelmingly Republican delegation to a minority of seven . It cast its electoral votes for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since the Civil War . Pennsylvania this year I. therefore at mast a potential source of Republican ' gains twice as important as all the New England states put together , for the G. O. P. could not even hope to pick up more than ten Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one state in the union that will afford the Republicans more joy or more disappointment when the votes are counted next November than any other . Which of these two alternatives is the more probable on the basis of- current developments your correspondent will endeavor to report In the course of the next week or ten days . To a greater extent than any other area of such political importance , Pennsylvania is peculiarly a region of " Roosevelt democracy " The party leaders cheerfully admit that they " did n't amount to much " until the New Deal came along . Incidentally , the only time the Keystone state was fOund outside the Republican column in a presidential election from the time of the Civil War until 1936 was when it cast its electoral votes for the Progressive ticket of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 . Although the Democratic party in Pennsylvania engaged In a bitter factional dispute at the time of the 1838 primary elections three months ago , this most certainly was not a split along pro-New Deal and anti-New Deal lines . Any such supposition Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clutch the Chief Executive 's coat-tails for all they are worth . But that , of course , is one of the major questions in this state today . How much are the Presidential coat-tails really worth in an offyear election ? in an election which , does not actually involve the casting of a single ballot for or against Franklin D. Roosevelt , the " father of Pennsylvania democracy . " This is something that will bear further examination , for if local political issues and local political personalities this year overshadow national ISSUCS and national personalities ( as is often the case in normal Congressional elections ) the Pennsylvania Democrats may be hard put to maintain their newfound eminence . . . . Gettysburg today unavoidably Impresses the casual traveler as a clutter of signs inviting tourists to spend the night . One sign reads , ominously : " Tourist Rooms " Garage Free " Confederate sharpshooters once occupied this house . " . . . A Pennsylvania state policeman , politely banding out printed explanations of the state 's SO mile speed limit at the state line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't have anything to do with politicians , " he asserted . " We go to school and if we ... make good that 's all there is to it . No politician can help you in the police department in this state . "
