txt The snowstorm that disrupted traffic Friday night dwindled steadily yesterday morning and finally stopped at 3:05 P. M. with the Weather Bureau setting the average depth for the city at 7.6 inches . Dr. James H. Kimball , meteorologist in charge , said the fall had been heavier in the northern parts of the city , approximating ten inches at some points , although no official maximum was available . In general , street conditions improved rapidly throughout the day . The snow left the usual aftermath of a city bewilderingly beautiful in spots like Central Park , but for the most part piled high with work for 40,872 men on the regular and emergency removal force , 4,015 trucks , plows and various loading machines and hundreds of thousands of home and shop owners . When the Department of Sanitation took stock as its big crew went off duty in two shifts , at 4 and 6 P. M. , City Superintendent Edward C. Nugent expected " quite a big hole " to have been made in the already thinned blanket of snow by tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . Rain Possible Tomorrow Department officials were hopeful that rain tomorrow would be a big help in the final clean-up . But the forecast also included a hint of more work . It was : " Fair today with slowly rising temperature in afternoon . Tomorrow rain or snow . Colder tomorrow afternoon and night . " Yesterday 's temperatures kept within a narrow range after a fivedegree drop to 24 between 9 and 10 A. M. Successive readings were 11 A. M. , 24 ; noon , 25 ; 1 P. M. , 25 ; 2 P. M. , 25 ; 3 P.

The Weather Bureau did not expect the temperature to fall below 20 or to rise quite to the thawing point between early morning and tonight . The disturbance that caused the precipitation , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea 200 miles south of Nantucket early yesterday . The Associated Press reports indicated that many sections of the country were having their most severe wintry spells of the season , in many cases the cold being an unpleasant contrast after an unusually protracted mild period . The survey attributed thirty-one deaths throughout the nation to weather conditions . Buffalo and Binghamton , N. Y. , were especially hard hit . Two deaths caused by heart disease were recorded among the countless snow-shovelers in the metropolitan area . The victims were Carl Cheancaro , 51 . years old , of 35-15 Crescent Street , Astoria , Queens , and Michael Rose , 69 , of 10 Dobbs Ferry Road , Elmsford . Two Children Killed Two children were killed and two policemen were among those injured in accidents .

Just as city traffic conditions reassumed the normal pace for a " morning after , " with motorists sometimes delayed but rarely halted , so the airlines affected Friday night by the storm were able to resume at least partial operations from noon on . At midday a spokesman at Newark Airport said planes were flying both " in and out " and , except for service between here and Boston , operations were " practically up to normal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained the morning schedule had been abandoned and afternoon flights were combined . For example , the usual 1 and 3:15 P. M. trips were consolidated . All railroads reported they were running full schedules on time . Greyhound buses were said to have encountered delays of an hour or so in New England and the Pocono area , but were in no case blocked . The Park Avenue vehicular tunnel between Thirty-'third and Fortyfirst Streets was closed early in the day because of slipperiness , but was reopened after sanding . The bureau of operations at Police Headquarters reported no serious mishaps from the storm and said no special arrangements were necessary . Deputy Chief Inspector James J. Sheehy added that the comparative lightness of traffic indicated many car-owners chose to leave their machines in the garage for the day . Probably the oddest mishap of the day in Manhattan required the attention of the Fire Department , not the police . About 4:30 P. M. an old-fashioned horse-drawn sleigh , with Morris Cooperstein of 333 East Ninety-second Street at the reins , came to grief at Seventy-fourth Street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel between the rails leading to the power conduit of the Third Avenue trolleys .

In some parts of the borough empty trains were run over exposed subway rails to keep ice from forming . Difficulties in the residential sections of Brooklyn , Queens , Staten Island , Long Island and Westchester were largely restricted to cleaning sidewalks and getting cars left out all night to start . In Northern New Jersey , the State police reported all main highways had been cleared by 2:30 A. M. , and that more trouble was arising from drivers trying to manoeuvre without chains than from any other source . Similar warnings on chains , and announcements of " all roads clear " came from other parts of the State . The Highway Department said 1,300 men and 500 plows were clearing 1,596 miles of roads .
