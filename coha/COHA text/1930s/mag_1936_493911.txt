Walled Cities Notes on a Trip to Berlin , Paris and London AS THE ship noses slowly up Southampton Water , our eyes , tired of the blank horizons of five days at sea , take in gratefully the signs of harbor : low-lying shores , black pillbox forts squatting in the water , tugs and navy craft , planes overhead . After the empty wastes of sea these sights look reassuringly human and friendly . But we are not Europeans . The young Polish mathematician standing next us at the rail is excited too , but in a somewhat different way . He indicates " all this " with a very slight smile as he says : " We see already a full picture of Europe ? destroyers , a submarine , airplanes . " In our innocence we were greatly and agreeably surprised by the appearance of Berlin . Instead of the Prussian-pompous city we had expected , we saw a big , old-fashioned town of comfortable aspect . The huge parks and tree-lined avenues may have hidden from us , at first , those massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had expected to be like one of Arnold Bennett 's super-caravanseries , seemed about the same style and vintage as New York 's venerable antique , the Murray Hill ; and Wertheim 's , the big department store , like any American emporium of twenty years ago . Later on , when we had seen Goering 's immense Air Ministry ( called by local wags " Hermann 's little writing room " ) and some others , we had to admit that German architecture can sometimes be as frightening as it tries to be . linter den Linden , without the lindens , was a disappointment . On the Kurfarstendamm , however , the lindens were still flourishing . And so , to our surprise , were the Jewish shops and restaurants . The Reichstag was also a disappointment . We expected to see , if not a gutted shell , at least some scars left by Van der Lubbe ? or was it a couple of other fellows ? Is there still a Reichstag , I inquired ? Oh , yes , to be sure ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It passes unanimous resolutions in favor of the latest decree , and then adjourns . For this patriotic service its members draw 500 marks a month . The Berliners on the streets were utilitarian rather than beautiful , from the ankles up , and they were apt to be dowdily dressed ; but they looked very solid , very real , and strangely enough , very cheerful . The faces of New York pedestrians were much more care-ridden . I wondered if this was an optical illusion , or more propaganda , and looked again . Could it be that Berliners look peaceful and contented because they are ? If they were aware of i the role in which the rest of the world has cast them , would they have the face to keep it up ? To an outside eye they seem to be living like a country at war , but apparently it feels to them like peace . I began to realize at last what Hitler must mean to the German people . In his will is their peace . The sidewalks were a peaceful scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The deaths caused by traffic accidents in Berlin . I was told on good authority , tot up to 150 a week ? which , considering the size of the city and the scarcity of cars , is a pretty high figure . But quite understandable , after you 've seen them drive . One way to reduce traffic accidents is to control the traffic ; another way is to stop traffic altogether . The latter seemed to be the German system . It is accomplished by means of ubiquitous parades ? S.A. , S.S. , Hitler Youth , : - krbeitsfront . To an unaccustomed eve these marching detachments look like soldiers . Even after it has been carefully explained that they are not , they still look like soldiers . There were " real " soldiers to be seen , of course . There was , for instance , the guard always on duty at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . ( The German version of his shrine made another mystery clear : his international veneration is a return to the old-time religion . He is the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Mars . ) Watching the guard changed at the Tomb , I saw for the first time the famous goose-step . It was quite a different thing from seeing it in the newsreels . That stiff-legged beat , that slaps the ground so hard it would jar off a helmet not held on by a chin-strap , is much less ridiculous than horrible . It is a perfect picture of controlled violence ; and it gives the onlooker ( and no doubt the goose-stepping soldier , even more ) the same sort of visceral sensation as bayoneting a prostrate foe while the bagpipes skirl . A Frenchman we met in Paris told us he had witnessed the march-past of this year 's Nazi rally at Nuremberg . From nine in the morning till four in the afternoon he had stood near the reviewing point , watching the endless lines go by ; each one , as it passed , breaking into the frenzied smash of the goose-step . For weeks afterwards , he said , he could think of nothing else . I suppose no war museum is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first sights that thrill your eye , in the entrance hall , are the - planes of von Richthofen and Udet . The exhibits of the Great War ( showing the equipment and armament of all the belligerents : all of the machinery but none of the product ) are arranged methodically by years ; and there must be some contagious madness in this method . For by the time you have reached 191S you can not escape the de1 1-1 h NEW REPUBLIC December 23 , - 1936 sired impression : that the War was an epic and the Germans its heroes , who went down at last fighting against insuperable odds . In spite of being hardened to national advertising campaigns , I could not quite get used to seeing ikons of Hitler all over the place . At a Bach recital there he was , in most Wagnerian mood , in a very brown study , frowning down on the uncomfortable pianist ? and on the numerous Jews in the audience . In a shop window on tinter den Linden , there he was again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when served up without salt , as it is in Germany . We went to a cabaret where a sketch showed a scene in former German East Africa . When the chorus sang a song listing the colonies Germany has lost but will regain , the song stopped the show , and had to be repeated three times . Occasionally , you hear , the propaganda does miss its mark . We heard of a train of anti-Communist caravans which was sent through the country districts to rouse the peasants to hatred of Russia . Apparently the nature of this demonstration was misunderstood by the simple farmers , who downed tools and ran , shouting that the Russians were coming . And there are jokes about the government , though of course they do n't get printed . Sample : an elderly gentleman , who had been sitting with a lady of his acquaintance on a streetcar , rose to take his departure , saying : " iluf wiedersehen , gracious lady . " An S.S. man , overhearing this , said in a loud voice : " Allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer any gracious ladies . " Voice from the back platform : " And no eggs either . " As your Paris-bound train carries you through the industrial towns of the Rhineland you see steel mills spouting smoke , and abandoned railway embankments covered with little truck gardens . That is rather a depressing sight , so you close your eyes and think what a nice place Berlin was . You wonder why your hostess said that Germans were sad ; compared to American business men , they looked the picture of cheerfulness . ( She had said of her fellow Berliners that they were " rather sad , very hardworking , rather hard up . " ) It is not until you are out of Germany that you realize she was right . The frontier is not yet completely closed , and the guns have not started ; but in every other respect Germany is at war . Hitler 's " moral equivalent " is so like war that it is practically the same thing . As soon as the train has crossed the border into France , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democracy . The roadbed immediately gets worse , the whole train takes on a rickety and individual air , the engine belches a particularly dirty brand of smoke , and you get to Paris an hour late . In spite of your irritation , it is a relief to find yourself back in the kind of civilization you understand . Paris looked prosperous . The fountains at the Rond Point were playing ; they had new bases oflalique glass , lit up from inside . The Automobile Show was on at the Grand Palais , and the Eiffel Tower was advertising the fact . The Champs Elysees was thronged with shiny cars , ranging from the swank to the chipper . The franc had been devalued , not a week before we arrived ; but prices seemed normal , and there was no excitement about the devaluation , even in the newspapers . The word you hear most frequently in any language is money , " but politics runs money a close second in Paris . We met several layers-down-of-the-law , of conflicting persuasions ; but they all , strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted the incontrovertible axiom that France was the last stronghold of civilization , and Paris its crown . At the movies you get a lengthy Pathe newsreel for your money and , if you go to the Marignan , the most comfortable theatre in the world to see it in . Premier Blum 's appearance on the screen was greeted with mingled hisses , whistles and handclap-ping , the applause just perceptibly predominating . At both beginning and end , the newsreel showed fearsome pictures of the German war machine in action : tanks , planes , bombs bursting , machine guns spitting , hoarse thousands in uniform cheering their leader . The audience took this for the most part in tense silence , broken by uneasy sighs and agitated whispers . Is this propaganda ? Or simply the same kind of aimless and irresponsible xenophobia to which our own newsreels and press treat us ? " So you find Paris looking prosperous ? " said a Frenchman who had been prospering in the four years since we met . " Ah , wait till you see London ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have waited till we saw London . When we got there , and were congratulating an English friend on his city 's condition , he grumbled , " Yes , but you ought to see South Wales . " The fact remains that London is a heartening sight . Londoners have always been well dressed ; now even the women look smart . Flats ( how much briefer , how much more expressive than " apartment houses " ) are going up all over the place . The traffic seems every bit as heavy as New York 's ; and in spite of London 's meandering streets and " circuses , " better directed . I am sorry to have to report ? for some of my best friends are Englishmen ? that the English attitude on Weltpolitik is still somewhat parochial . Not that they make the social mistake the French do , of trying to prove to the rest of the world that France must be supported because she is the keystone in the arch ; but sometimes their opinion of themselves , and their ignorance of others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the uproar in the American press about Mrs. Simpson was largely discounted by many English people as a vulgar indication of America 's anxiety to boost its countrywoman up the highest possible social peak . After even a brief stay in London , you wonder if anyone can possibly be so secure as the English the same time , the papers are full of the insufficiency of the British Fleet , the muddled squabbles about the very beginnings of an air program , the alarming shortage of army recruits , owing to the equally alarming condition of the lower classes , which should be well fed enough to feed the army . - The Polish mathematician who saw " a full picture " of present-day Europe by a glance at warships and bombing planes may well have future history on his side : it is almost inconceivable that Europe can emerge from her present situation into any state but war . In fact , it seems clear that the " next war " has already begun ? in countries like Germany , Italy and Russia it linedeleted dictatorship to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind you of the fact that can not be put into newspapers and that somehow never gets said by statesmen : that the only way human beings can be persuaded to war is through fear and ignorance of their fearful and ignorant neighbors . You may also be reminded of the fact that the ordinary inhabitants of even capital cities are as shut off from each other today as if they lived in the walled towns of the Middle Ages .
