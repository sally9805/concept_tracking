The national frenzy to grab neighbors ' territory was started by Adolf Hitler 's Sudeten grab . The rest of Central Europe thereupon went grab crazy , Hungary getting 4,800 sq . mi. of Czechoslovakia , Poland getting 400 . Like the 1937 U. S. sit-down fad , the grab craze has now infected people who have less &; less excuse to be infected by it . <P> In Hungary last week the Cabinet fell ( and rose again four days later ) as a result of demonstrations in Budapest by grab crazy mobs who did not think that Hungary 's 4,800-square-mile grab was enough . In Sofia , Bulgaria , grab fever rose high at week 's end , the 19th anniversary of the Treaty of Neuilly . Through Sofia 's streets day before the anniversary milled a defiant crowd of 20,000 who demanded land back from Rumania , Yugoslavia , Greece . Martial law was declared , firemen turned their hoses on demonstrators , 1,000 were arrested . Chances are that the Bulgarian grab fever will simply have to subside without treatment . Bulgaria is fenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Turkey . Military leaders of these nations were meeting last week at Athens .
