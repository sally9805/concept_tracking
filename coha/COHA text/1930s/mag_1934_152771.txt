Last year Irving Ter Bush , founder of Brooklyn 's big Bush Terminal Co. , regained control of his corporation after a long , confused , mysterious proxy battle ( TIME , March 23 , 1933 ) . Few weeks later Bush Terminal subsided into receivership . Last fortnight the receivers asked Mr. Bush to resign as head of the various subsidiaries ( which are not in receivership ) . Mr. Bush angrily refused . Last week the receivers , voting the stock in the subsidiaries , unceremoniously ousted Mr. Bush , put in their own managements . Irving Ter Bush retained the dubious title of president &; chairman of the parent company , whose affairs are dictated by receivers responsible only to Federal courts .
