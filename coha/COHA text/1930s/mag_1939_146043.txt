Last month the frail body of Hirosi Saito , Japan 's late Ambassador to the U. S. , arrived at Yokohama in state on the U. S. cruiser Astoria . Japan 's people were touched . Last week the U. S. battle fleet eased itself through the Panama Canal , sailed into the Pacific , rationed and ammunitioned for long-range action . Japan 's officialdom appeared touched . Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita made agreeable sounds to the effect that Japan 's partnership in the Berlin-Rome axis was for purely anti-Communist reasons : Japan wanted no part in attacking the Democracies ( see p. 18 ) . <P> This information was the more interesting because last week Foreign Relations Chairman Key Pittman-after weeks of outcry by friends of peace and of China , ranging from Elder Statesman Henry Stimson to Author Pearl ( The Good Earth ) Buck-laid before the Senate a joint resolution authorizing President Roosevelt to embargo all exports ( except agricultural products ) to Japan , and all imports from her . Reason : the Japanese Government flagrantly violated the Nine Power Treaty , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . To be sure , this has been true for several years . Senator Pittman thought up his noble Resolution only when it was hammered into him that his blanket cash- &-carry; law , with which he proposes to replace that part of the Neutrality Act which expired last week , would serve only to help Japan at China 's expense , just as the old Neutrality had done . <P> Because of the Son of Heaven 's birthday ( Hirohito was 38 last week ) official Japan reserved comment on Senator Pittman 's proposal , which would indeed be a one-two pair of punches to Japan 's military economy . But the new direction of Japan 's diplomacy was further clarified in a speech at Los Angeles last week by the man with whom Japan replaced dying Hirosi Saito last December . <P> Ambassador Saito more or less endeared himself to the U. S. by drinking Scotch whisky and playing poker . Ambassador Kensuke Horinouchi 's technique is even more bland , more thoroughly Americanized than that of his late classmate at the Imperial University . His conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28-year career man , aged 53 , he was embassy secretary in London during the War , worked on the peace treaties afterwards . He was consul-general in Manhattan from 1931 to 1934 , with homes in Greenwich , Conn , and on Park Avenue . Golf is his game ; drinking and smoking are not among his vices . Both he and his wife ( childless ) are Christians . It is now fashionable in Japan to exhibit Chinese culture . The Horinouchis go in for paintings and porcelain . They are sophisticated in Occidental music . <P> At the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce , Kensuke Horinouchi ( his name means : " In the Moat " ) smiled his toothiest smile last week and said : <P> " What is impressive is the fact that two great nations have preserved an unbroken friendship for many years . . . . Japan sees few reasons for an end to this peace . . . . <P> " The common benefits of trade alone should be enough to guarantee this . American-Japanese commerce survived the depression years in good shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire , we are your best customer . " <P> Later , off the rostrum , Ambassador Horinouchi smiled some more and said :
