Peace Without Victory ( Cont 'd ) <P> The Bolivian generals who lost the three-year Gran Chaco War for their country dropped into harmless obscurity after the Peace Without Victory wangled by seven American nations ( TIME , June 24 ) . Not so last week the Paraguayan colonels who won the war for theirs . <P> To illiterate Paraguayan veterans , the shining fact was that Corps Commander Colonel Rafael Franco , 39 , had led them victoriously in person to the very border of Bolivia proper . Something seemed wrong when their commanding officer , General Jos Felix Estigarribia , marched them home to poverty-stricken Paraguay , when Foreign Minister Luis Riart signed a modest peace protocol with Bolivia , when the Paraguayan Congress approved it and when President Eusebio Ayala ordered the Paraguayan Army demobilized and Bolivian prisoners returned to Bolivia . The Army had won the war ; the politicians were throwing away the victory . Last month General Estigarribia charged Colonel Franco with organizing a so-called National Front of 42,000 War veterans and planning a coup d ' tat . Franco was exiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federico Weddell Smith and Camilo Recalde , ran off as neat a revolution in Paraguay as anyone would like to see . <P> In the early cool of one morning , an army corps of jungle veterans mobilized around the chief square of Paraguay 's capital of Asuncin . At 7 o'clock they seized the railway station and two radio stations , broke off telephone , telegraph and rail communications and advanced on the Government forces in the nearby police headquarters . Against the veterans President Ayala had only the police and the crews of the Paraguayan Navy 's five gunboats . The gunboats dropped shells into the square . The veterans replied with their old trench mortars . That night the President fled to a gunboat whence he radioed his resignation . He was confined in the marine barracks . More dangerous , Estigarribia and Presidential Candidate Luis Riart were arrested . Next afternoon Colonel Franco stepped out of an Argentine plane at Asuncin , made himself Provisional President , set up a Government . <P> Franco 's Foreign Minister Juan Stefanich promptly fired all the old regime 's Ambassadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets was a Franco manifesto packed with high Latin bombast : " The War was won despite the Government and the encyclopedic ineptitude of the army high command , thanks to the heroism and abnegation of the people . . . . The new Government will arrange a just peace with Bolivia , cede to the homeless the lands now owned by the wealthy , colonize the country with Paraguayans instead of undesirable foreigners , grant subsidies to war widows and mutilated veterans . . . . " <P> Inasmuch as the Gran Chaco peace protocol , ratified by the Paraguayan Congress , and the international South American declaration in 1932 that " military conquest grants no sovereignty , " are now part of Paraguay 's national law , Franco could do nothing last week but agree to abide by those treaties . <P> To the South American nations that had wangled the peace protocol and had just accepted President Roosevelt 's invitation to a great Pan-American Peace Conference in Buenos Aires , Colonel Franco was last week a piercing pain in the neck .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
