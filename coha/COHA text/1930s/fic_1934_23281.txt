FRUIT TRAMP A STORY BY DANIEL MAINWARING N JULY the fruit tramps came to Clo- vis . They put up tents in the eucalyptus grove along the track , and at night you could see them sitting around their little fires . The Elbertas would be ripening when they drove in battered Fords and Chevrolets along the highway to the hills . Within a week a community would spring up in the grove to stay there until the last peach was in the sweat box and the last raisin had been hauled to the packing shed . Every year or so , there was talk of turning the grove into a park , but no one did anything about it . Once in a while the townspeople sent Old Tim , the constable , over to make the fruit tramps clean up around the tents that looked like dirty bits of fungus growing against the tree trunks . Tim would hang about for a while talking to the children and telling the women to hang their washing so it could not be seen from the road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't look so good from John Good 's store . Better get ' em out of sight . " He would grumble a little and then go back to his chair on the porch of his office and sit there for the rest of the day , half asleep , his big hat pulled down over his eyes to keep out the glare of the sun , sucking at his dead pipe and shouting to the people he knew . Farmers who needed help went to the grove and hired a family , children and all , paying the men so much a day to pick the fruit and the women and children a few cents a box for cutting peaches . Usually one of the little girls stayed at the camp to cook supper and have it ready when the family came back at dusk , and during the day in the fruit season you could see them bending over the pots or washing clothes or making miniature cities out of syrup cans and spools when they had nothing else to do . For a while , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and the tramps made plenty of money . Six dollars a day the men were paid , and the women received as high as four or five cents a box . It was n't bad being a fruit tramp then . But people in the cities stopped eating so many peaches and raisins . Prices went way down . The mortgage companies came , took the Lincolns and Cadillacs out of the barns , loaded the furniture the farmers had bought in good times into moving vans and drove away , and the banks foreclosed on the land and took over some of the farms . Still the fruit tramps came every year when the Elbertas were turning yellow in the shiny leaves . Not so many came , but the grove was pretty well filled with men and women and children who drove along the highway leading to the hills and pitched their camps in the shade of the trees planted there by a man named Cole fifty years before . When times were bad it was n't easy to make a living picking peaches and grapes , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trays . It was hard , unpleasant work . Out in the orchards the heat waves rose , and when you knelt on the earth to pick the fruit up the sand burned through your overalls . The cutting sheds offered little shelter from the sun , and the fuzz from the peaches crept up the women 's arms and down the necks of their dresses . They stood all day on the packed earth of the shed , picking the fruit up with their nimble fingers , jabbing the knife point into the soft flesh and , with a twist , halving the fruit . The filled trays piled up , and before the stack was thirty high the shorter women and the little girls had to stand on boxes so they could reach . Usually the farmer 's youngest son rustled for the cutters , taking the empty boxes away , putting full ones in front of the women , pushing the cars loaded with trays of fruit into the sulphur houses which stood back of the sheds . When the wind blew from the sulphur houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the early morning everyone would be cheerful and the girls would giggle when the rustler pushed against them and the women would shout at the men who drove up in the vineyard trucks . In the afternoon though everyone would be tired and cross and the rustler would growl at the women to hurry . By that time their skins would be covered with peach fuzz and would itch and burn and where they scratched themselves with sticky fingers a rash would break out . Our family was so big that we did n't have to hire any fruit tramps , but did the work ourselves . Sometimes when the crop was poor we went over to the Jap 's and helped him out . Otherfarmers thought father was lucky because he had so many children to do his work . He used to say , " Well , let them try to feed you for a while and then they 'll know who 's lucky . " Once he offered to trade ranches with John Cadwallader , who had one son . " I 'll take your boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'll hire me some tramps to do the work . They feed themselves . " When things got bad we did n't feel it like the other farmers , or maybe it was because we had n't been used to anything much . It always took all the money father made to feed us , so we never bought a car or new furniture , and father said he could n't afford a mortgage . The summer when prices were lowest did n't affect us as it did the others . We were in a position to sit back and watch when the trouble with the fruit tramps started . It was hot that year . There had been little rain and when June came the mountain tops were bare of snow . From the valley you could see little patches near the ragged crest of the ridge , like bits of paper scattered through the trees . The canals were dry and the river was so low we did n't dare go swimming because they said we 'd get typhoid fever . All night the engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spilling it into the ditches , and sometimes late at night we would go over to the Jap 's and lie naked in the little pool near the pump , letting the cold water cover us . We had no pumping plant of our own , so the Jap gave us water when we needed it because we always helped him get his crop in when ours was poor . The fruit tramps came again that year , more of them than ever . There were new faces in the grove . People who did n't know what a raisin was FRUIT put up tents and looked round for wink , They came from farther away , from Los Angeles and San Francisco where things were bad too and work was hard to find . It was a cheap way to spend a summer , camped in a grove of eucalyptus trees rent free , and I suppose they figured the fruit had to be picked so the farmers would pay them to do it . Around the first of July , when the Elbertas were coloring up enough so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge to talk to father . " What you paying this year ? " father asked . " Do n't know . Last year we paid two-bits an hour . We ca n't now . " " You 'll make more leaving the peaches on the trees , " father said . " What you going to do ? " " We 'll get along , " father said , pointing to where we were sitting on the porch with mother stringing capri figs on wires . " I got all the help I need . All I got to do is feed ' em . " " You 're lucky , " Aubrey said . " Try it some time , " father said . " I 'll trade you the whole lot for a pair of mules . " " You wo n't trade me for a mule , " my sister Rose said . " I could n't get a mule for you , " father said . " Who 'd want you ? " " If we pay fifteen cents an hour , we can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figure I can make a hundred and fifty bucks off my Elbertas if I pay that . " " They wo n't take it , " father said . " Let ' em starve then . " Aubrey started his Ford and went away along the dusty , rutted road . We heard no more about it for a week or so . Then father went in to town for some flour and rice and beans and talked for a long time to John Good . At dinner that night he told mother all the farmers had got together and decided to pay fifteen cents an hour to the pickers and a cent a box to the cutters . " You 'd make ten cents a day , " he told Rose . " Not that much , " my brother Joe said . " Maybe eight . " Rose threw a book at him and he grabbed her and they rolled over on the porch , almost upsetting the coal oil lamp . " Stop it . I 'll lick you both , " mother said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd hate to work for that . " " I work for less , " mother said . " Want to quit ? " " Sure , " mother said , but when we saw her face we knew she did n't mean it . " I 'm sorry for the farmers , " father said . " But it 's their own fault . They bought a lot of junk when things were good . They put in electric lights and drove round in cars they could n't pay for . I guess they 'll always be like that though . I 'm sorry for those tramps too . That is n't such a nice way to Eve , camped in the center of town on the dirty ground with everybody looking at your washing hanging on the line , knowing how many holes there are in your undershirt , seeing you eat your dinner every night . " " They do n't mind , " mother said . " Some of them do . The new ones . There 's people camped in the grove who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make trouble , John says . Says some of them are Reds . " " What 's Reds ? " my sister Nell asked . " Russians , " father said . " But why Reds ? Why not blues or pinks or yellows ? " Nell asked . " Call them anything you like , " father said . " I think it 's a lot of talk anyway . They do n't look bad to me . Only kind of pitiful and white-faced like they did n't have enough to eat . I wanted to take the grub over and give it to them . " " That would have been fine , " mother said . " Then you could have felt sorry for us . " I took the wagon in to Clovis next day to have the blacksmith set the tires . I hung round the shop for a while , helping him with the forge , watching him as he spun the steel hoop on the anvil and hit it with his hammer while the sparks flew all around him and dropped in the inch-thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out into the sun and walked down the main street to John Good 's store . A lot of farmers were hanging about outside , talking . After I listened for a time I found they were having trouble getting pickers . Some of the fruit tramps were willing to work for anything and they had gone out to the farms ; but the rest said they 'd rather starve than pick peaches for fifteen cents an hour . Jake Cole came back from the grove pretty soon . ' ' There 's a big guy over there who thinks he 's running things , " Jake said . " He 's getting the tramps all together and telling them not to work . He says they should get a living wage . " " He 's a damn Communist , " Hal Bradley said . There was a little hunchback in the crowd named Emory Whitfield who lived about a mile from our place . He got pretty excited and began waving his arms and swearing . " Those damn Rooshians , " he said , " they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell do they think they are anyway ? " When he talked he kept bobbing his head , and the hump on his back looked like something loose stuck inside of his blue work shirt . He had n't shaved for a long time and around his lips his red whiskers were brown from tobacco juice . " He do n't look like a Rooshian to me , " Jake said . " He 's as white as I am . " " You ai n't so white , " Hal said . " Maybe you would be if you went in the ditch once in a while . " " You ca n't tell about Communists by their looks , " a farmer I did n't know said . " It 's the way they talk you can tell by . " " Well , he 's always talking about a living wage , " Jake said . " Then he 's a Red . They always talk like that , " the farmer said . " Let 's all go over and talk to him , " Hal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we got to live too he 'll be rea-sonable . " " Maybe he wo n't . I already told him , " Jake said . " It wo n't do no hurt , " IIal said . " Let 's run him out of town , " the hunchback said . " We been treating them too good , giving them a place to live and all . I been saying for years we should n't let them live in the grove . Look how dirty they keep it . " When I thought about the hunchback 's ranch and how dirty the house and yard and outhouses were , I snickered , but no one paid any attention to me . They went across the road and I followed , the hot dust burning my bare feet . I ran across quickly and stood in the shade as close as I could get to the tent where the big man they called a Communist lived . He was sitting on a lug box , cutting a chain out of a piece of white pine with a thin-bladed knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He was a big man with broad shoulders , bigger even than father , and through the faded blue shirt you could see the muscles on his arms like big lumps . His hair was as pale colored as straw and around his neck and ears it was ragged . Probably his wife cut his hair as mother did mine , with a pair of dull scissors . Some of the other tramps left their tents and came over and stood behind the big man , and you could see he was different from them because his clothes were clean and his face and hands were clean and when he talked he spoke good English . " Well , how about it ? " Hal asked . " Jake here says you boys wo n't work for less than two bits an hour . " " That 's right , " the big man said . " We ca n't pay that , " Hal said and you could see he was trying to be nice about it . " We do n't make much off our farms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get by if we pay fifteen cents . " " Would you work for that ? " the big man asked . " If I was hungry I would , " Hal said . " We are n't that hungry , " the big man said . Emory Whitfield pushed up to the front and waved his fist . " You will be before we get through with you , " he said . " Shut up , Emory , " Hal said . " Let me do the talking . It wo n't do no good to get tough about it . " The big man smiled at Hal . " You seem reasonable . Now put yourself in our place . We have to eat too . I feel that it would be better not to work at all than to slave in this hot sun for nothing . " " What do you mean nothing ? " the hunchback yelled . " Ai n't we willing to pay you fifteen cents an hour and your women folks a cent a box for cutting ? " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . " We wo n't do it , so there 's no use talking about it . " " By God ! let 's run ' em out of town , " the hunchback said . Hal grabbed Whitfield 's arm and told him to shut up . " You think it over , " he said to the big man . " We ca n't pay no more and it ai n't because we do n't want to . We got to Iive too . " " I know , " the big man said . The crowd went back to the store . I was going to hang around but then I looked at the clock and remembered about the wagon . I hurried back to the blacksmith shop , hitched up the team , and drove on home . When I told father about the trouble at the grove he said I 'd better keep away from the fruit tramps or I 'd get hurt . They did n't give in and the farmers did n't give in , so the Elbertas ripened on the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the packing sheds , the empty refrigerator cars stood waiting and the crews of women who were to pack the peaches for shipment to the east were laid off . Four families got tired of going hungry and went to work on the Miller ranch . Because the other tramps were mad at them for not holding out , they moved their tents into the willows along Dry Creek , There had been a couple of fist fights in Clovis already , and some of the tramps were threatening to dump out the fruit that lay on trays in Miller 's drying yard down by the river , or so the farmers said . A barn half filled with hay on the Thompson ranch caught fire and burned , and people round us blamed the tramps , though father was sure the Thompson boys had been smoking in the hay loft . Some of the farmers wanted trouble but the rest were pretty upset about the whole business , feeling sorry for themselves and for the strikers . It was n't nice to go by the grove and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat . Four or five women in the town got groceries together and took them over to the camp . The big man thanked them and said they did n't need charity , but when he was n't hooking some of the others took the things the women brought . That 's what we heard from the farmers who stopped in at dusk to sit on the tank house steps and talk to father . I saw the big man again two weeks after the strike started . Father and I were spreading trays in the drying yard on the sand , which was burning hot even though the sun was gone . After a while we knocked off to get a drink , and as I brought the cool water from the well I saw him coming through the orchard , carrying a shotgun . Joe , standing on the porch with his face pressed against the screen , told father to look and pointed at the big man . " He 's going to dump our peaches out , " Joe whispered . " Hush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offered him the dipper filled with water . The big man leaned his gun against the stairs and took the dipper . " Any Tuck ? " father asked . The big man shook his head . " Thought I might get a rabbit . Did n't see a single one . " " We do n't eat rabbits round here this time of year , " father said . " They have sores on their necks . " " They 'd be better than nothing , at that . " Father held out his hand . " My name 's Bigelow . " " Mine 's Martin . " " You do n't live around here . " " No . I 'm camped in the grove . One of the strikers . " Joe had come out of the porch and stood near the pump . " Are you a Red ? " he asked . " Joe . " Father frowned at him . " Do I look like it , son ? " the big man asked and when father started to apologize , he laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . It does n't hurt my feelings . " Father roiled a cigarette and gave the papers and tobacco to Martin . " Sit on the steps a while . " Martin sat down , poured the tobacco in a paper , made a cigarette . " I 'm neutral in this business , " father said . " I got so many kids I do n't hireany help . Could n't if I wanted to . " " Do you blame us for holding out ? " " They ca n't pay more . " " Perhaps not . But it seems wrong to me to work for such a little bit . They 're taking advantage of our pov-erty . " " You 've never been a farmer , have you ? " " No . This is my first fling at it . Until now I worked in cities . " " You do n't see things the way we do then , " father said . " I guess not . I only know I wo n't work for fifteen cents an hour , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't either . " Father did n't say anything more until mother told us supper was ready . " You might as well have supper with us , Mr. Martin . " Martin stood up . " No thanks . They 're waiting for me in the grove . " Mother came through the back door . " Please stay . I 'll fix some things for you to take home . " " Thanks , " the big man said . " I could n't do that . " And he went away from us , down the lane to the bridge toward town . I watched him until his big form was out of sight . Saturday morning , three weeks after the strike started , Jake Cole came over to borrow our hay wagon . One of his eyes was black and there was a bruise on his jaw . " Celebrating ? " father asked . Jake shook his head . He was pretty serious . " We had a big fight in town last night . A bunch of us , maybe ten , went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those guys . " " Did n't have much luck , did you ? " " We will , " Jake said . " Let them alone , " father told him . " You 'll just get into trouble and your fruit will rot anyway . " " We 're going to fix them to-night , " Jake said . " Last night we told ' em . FRUIT I told that big guy , I said , ' By God , either you pick our fruit for what we 'll pay you or get out of our town . ' " Father looked up from hooking the traces . " That sort of stuff gets you nowhere , Jake . " " You talk like you was stringing along with them . " Jake sounded angry . " Be yourself , Jake . I do n't want to see you get into trouble . " " All the boys arc going to be there . You better show up too . " " Not me . " " You getting yellow ? Want us to think that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father said . " Go haul your hay and cool off . If I did n't know you so well I 'd kick your pants for you . " Jake drove off in our wagon . Father saw me standing around watching and told me to get the hell out in the fields and go to work . I took a shovel and ran out to where Joe was cutting a ditch across the lower end of I1 , the patch of Lovells . It would be three weeks yet before they were ripe , and father thought one last soaking would make them a lot bigger . After supper father hitched the team to the buckboard and climbed to the seat . Joe and I asked if we could go along , but he said no , he had some business to attend to , and the best place for us was home . After he was out of sight we told mother we were going over to the Jap 's to swim and lit out on the short cut to Clovis . We ran for a way , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of vines and looked at the moon coming up over the hills . It was pretty dark because there was only a piece of moon like a sickle you have just shined up on the grindstone hanging right hack of Kings River canyon . The wind was soft and cool to our faces and it moved the arms of the grapevines a little , making a soft whispering sound as though it was trying to tell us something . Joe tugged at my arm . " Let 's hurry , " he said . We walked fast along the creek , cut through the Malstar place to the road and then followed the railroad tracks to town . " Better not let father see us , " Joe said . " He 'd sure be mad . " There was a packing shed right at the end of the grove , and we climbed on the platform and sat on some lug boxes , waiting . It was pretty quiet at first . Away off a train whistled twice and you could hear the engine puffing , the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through the trees you could see them sitting around their fires . A lot of automobiles were parked in front of the stores that faced the main street and up at the end of the line was our buckboard , the only one there , but father was n't in it . Someone was talking in a loud voice over by John Good 's store . We moved our boxes back so no one could see us , and waited , and then a lot of men were crossing the road to the grove . It was too dark to see who they were , but I knew they were farmers and that father was probably with them . The crowd stopped not far from the tracks , right in front of us . Out of the trees came a bunch of men and the big man was in front . I looked all through the crowd but could n't see father , and that made me feel better . Emory Whitfield stepped forward and began to yell , " Get the hell out of our town or we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're harming no one , " the big man said . " We have a right to do as we please . " " Not in this town , you do n't . " Jake Cole moved toward the tramps beside the hunchback . " Pack up your trash and get out of here . " " We stay here , " the big man said . The farmers moved closer . A couple of them had shotguns under their arms . Others were carrying pitchforks and /umber . The tramps edged backward , all but the big man . " They wo n't hurt us , " he said . " Not if you clear out we wo n't , " Jake said . " Do n't let them frighten you , " the big man told the other tramps . The hunchback started to yell again , running back and forth between the crowds of men , yelling at the farmers to run the tramps out of town . Someone was coming fast across the road . It was father , and Old Tim , the constable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle this , " father told the farmers . " I routed him out and brought him over here . It 's his job . You boys go on home before you get into trouble . " " You keep your nose out of this , " Jake said . The hunchback was jumping up and down in front of father . " You got a mess of kids to do your work , " he said . " You do n't have to worry none . Come butting in here when it 's none of your damn business . " " Send ' em all home , Tim , " father said . " To-morrow you can clear the camp out . Old man Gait will give you an order . But hell , they ca n't move to-night . " Jake stepped up close to father . " I said to keep your nose out of this . " Jake was pretty big but my father was a head taller and a lot broader . He grabbed Jake 's shoulder , spun him around , and planted his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that coming to you , Jake , " he said . " Run along home . " One of the farmers raised a club . " Look out , father , " I yelled . It did n't do any good . The two by four smashed against his head , he put up his hands , moved around like he was dizzy , and then fell down . Joejumped off the platform screaming " Father , father " at the top of his voice , and I jumped after him . And as we ran toward the crowd the big man jumped forward , grabbed Jake , and hurled him at the farmers . I caught Joe and held him because we could n't do any good . He kept screaming , clawing at my hands to get loose , and over his head I saw the men fighting , the big man hitting at the people I knew with his fists , all alone because the other tramps had run into the grove . " Red . Bolshevik . Rooshian , " the hunchback was yelling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big man , but he was thin , and the tramp picked him up and tossed him out of the way as though he were a little boy . Then the big man stood there , telling them to come on , telling them to drive him out of town . A gun went off and a red flame pointed at the big man . He put his hands over his belly and started moving backward , very slowly , toward the grove , but he did n't get there . Maybe he tripped over something , I do n't know ; but he fell down and a woman came running out to him , took his head in her arms , and started to cry . All of a sudden the farmers were gone and father was sitting up , holding his head and swearing . We went over to him , and Joe held on to him tight and kept asking , " You all right , father , you all right ? " Old Tim helped father up and we alI went over and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out with his head in the woman 's lap , and she was crying . In the grove the fruit tramps were tearing the tents down and packing their stuff in automobiles , and inside of an hour there was only one tent Ieft in the grove . That belonged to the big man and he did n't need it any more .
