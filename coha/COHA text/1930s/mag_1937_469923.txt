next war may turn out to be a I shocking affair , but for the time being the world is enjoying it hugely . It is , at least in places , luxuriating in that pleasant by-product of war ? a war-trade boom ? without the war ; a sort of bloodless war prosperity . The blood will come later . Some countries are like a small town into which a millionaire maniac has escaped with all his money , rolling up and down Main Street , flinging his cash about among the happy merchants . Broken , half-bankrupt Europe now finds in her midst a shopper of infinite and reckless means ? the War God ? maddest of all spendthrifts , tossing his borrowed money about for ships and planes and tanks and machine guns and gas masks and poisons of many sorts . This grim fellow may end up by blowing the world to bits ; but no one can deny that , pending the catastrophe , he is making business wherever he goes . And so while we argue about the next war and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its work upon us . War of coursehas many consequences , social , cultural , physical . Among these are its economic consequences . And these differ from the other fruits of war in this , that they do not wait for the war itself to come down on us . The slaughter will not begin until the armies take the field . We shall not brutalize ourselves wholly by the murders and cruelties of war until the slaughter gets under way . But already , long before the first gun sounds , the war , still undeclared and unfought , has begun its economic effects . You can not produce a machine gun or a hand grenade by a mere act of ambition or hate . You must set up a factory , put men to work , buy steel and copper and leather . Soon wages flow out to workers . Make up your mind to have a great air armada , and presently thousands of men will be employed in plane factories , coal mines , iron mines , steel plants , and a score of other industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these war industries will get wages and they will take them to the grocer and haberdasher , the movie theater and the automobile salesman , and soon you will see the wages which began in a wartime factory roosting in the cash register of the merchants and flowing thence to jobber and manufacturer and mine and farm , sending a little thrill of life through all the economic anatomy . And so a little flush of prosperity follows your plan for air defense . But suppose , instead of merely setting out to make a few hundred or a thousand planes , you decide to arm the nation to the teeth . Suppose your vainglorious or desperate or merely bewildered dictator goes in for producing battleships and machine guns and tanks and explosives and armaments of every description . Into the armament factories , the steel mines , the coal and oil industries , the machine-tool industries , the shipyards , the plane plants , the textile mills , the metal industries , and a hundred other centers of economic activity , orders will flow for hundreds of millions ? billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and auxiliary enterprises will hale men to work by the hundreds of thousands . This is the first phase . Then , as the wages and material costs flow into the war industries in this first wave , the next wave will take all the money out into the peacetime industries . The wages of the gun-maker will buy cloth and shoes and food . And soon the peacetime industries , under the stimulation of these vast new floods of purchasing power , will be summoning other hundreds of thousands of workers to the peacetime factories . Prices will rise much . Wages will rise a little . Profits will soar greatly . And then one day you will pick up your newspaper and read in the financial column the na ? ve assurance of some half-informed financial reporter that Germany has shown " marked recovery " ; that " Japan leads all countries in her ascent from the depression . " And some traveler , returning from his summer jaunt to Naples and Milan and Rome , will tell you that " under Mussolini Italy has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But ? and here is the rub ? the prosperity is all based on the war effort . It begins with the making of war apparatus and will end when that ends . The war effort is so great that in the very act of expanding the war machine the peace machine is at first expanded and then crowded out . The energies of the nation are focused more and more on war production . There is not enough steel for guns and children 's toys too . And so the making of toys ceases and the dictator calls upon the " little patriots " to turn into the " Motherland " the toys they already have to make guns for their grown-up brothers to play with . There are not enough credits abroad to buy copper and iron and coal and also wheat and butter which the people need , and so the credits are used to buy the more essential war supplies . And they have indeed become essential . For now the one industry which has become the basis of the economic prosperity of the nation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the preparation for war has now become necessary to the stability of the whole country . And thus a nation at peace becomes hopelessly dependent on the war effort to support the nation in peace . This is the tragic mess into which the advocates of armament as the guardian and guarantee of peace have at last drawn unhappy Europe . They began by provoking arms production to protect their societies from war . They end by making the war industry essential to protect the society from a more terrible enemy ? industrial collapse . Europe can not live without her arms plants and can not live with them . She will probably resolve the difficulty in the end by hurling herself into the arms of both war and depression . And now the wide-circling waves of this mad current have touched our own shores and flooded into our own country . The American busy with his own affairs has little conception of the vastness of the effort which goes on in Europe in preparation for the next war to save the world for something or other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching troopers , saluting children , ship launchings , and other war scenes conforming to the photographer 's conception of war . But the war now is being fought in the industrial plants and the banking houses of Europe . This phase of the struggle does not make good material for the March of Time . Hence the average reader sees little of it . But the immense effort which is going on in the world to-day may be seen at a glance in the following simple table . It reveals the " defense expenditures " of six major nations in 1931 and 1936 : The leading nations of the world , excluding the United States and South and Central America , spent $4,232,000,000 in 1931 on " national defense . " Last year they spent $9,552,000,000 . Here is an increase of over five billion dollars . This is nearly twice the amount spent by this country on recovery and relief in a year . So that while we have been clambering back to recovery on govern . ment monies spent on various WPA , CCC , PWA and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing back on expenditures for war . But this year the outlays will he far greater . For now France and England have joined the warrior nations on a large scale . M. Blum 's government has laid out an armament program to cost 19,000 , - 000,000 francs ( $890,000,000 ) over the next four years . This is for military roads , the extension of the Maginot Line of fortresses along the Belgian and Swiss frontier , and for industrial mobilization . It is in addition to a similar sum of 19 million francs in the regular budget for defense purposes this year . So that France proposes war expenditures this year in excess of a billion dollars . Great Britain has decided to spend $7,500,000,000 , spread over the next five years , on armament construction . This is in addition of course to her large outlays upon her ordinary military and naval establishment . The ministry has laid plans to spend a billion , five hundred million dollars a year on battleships , naval and air bases , armament factories , and the modernization of her military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow up to two billion dollars for this purpose . He has already offered a loan of ? 100,000,000 as the first step in this warlike program to buttress England 's threatened empire on land and sea and , incidentally , has suffered the humiliation of seeing it tardily subscribed . Italy has just increased the war budget 727,000,000 lire over last year 's , while Germany 's outlays are lost under such a maze of strategic financial devices that no one can tell to what new limits they have gone . These are vast sums . But they are supplemented by other large grants by almost every nation , great and small , to expand their arsenals and multiply their armaments . France has loaned Poland $I21 , - 000,000 for this purpose . The little Netherlands is spending 43,000,000 guilders to strengthen her East Indian defense . Czechoslovakia has floated a loan of $120,000,000 to strengthen her armies and protect her frontiers . What the whole amount to be spent by the world , outside of the United States and South America , will be no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not less than twelve billion dollars . The average American is familiar with what has happened in this country in our effort to climb out of the depression and lie has heard no little about the staggering deficits we have piled up in the past four years in our little domestic war on hard times . We have borrowed and spent three and a half billion dollars a year on recovery and relief . And in the presence of this even this great rich country now stands somewhat aghast and turns an apprehensive ear to the mounting clamor for economy . Those other cruelly depressed nations of the world , on the edge of financial chaos , will , nevertheless , manage to spend this year nearly four times as much as our great relief and recovery bill ? and all on war preparations . I have not been able to find any really reliable figures on the expenditures in the first year of the World War , but I think they were probably not much in excess of preparation expenditures in this year of peace . This year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire war debt due by the Allies to this country . It is not difficult to imagine the effect of these huge outlays , raised for the most part by inflationary central bank loans , upon the whole economic system of Europe . All the leading countries now find themselves in a position in which the abandonment of the war preparations would be an economic disaster second only to war itself . During the World War , before our own entrance into it , every rumor of peace overtures sent a thrill of fright through Wall Street . In December , 1916 , just before Germany made that last fatal bid for peace as a prelude to the final submarine campaign of ruthlessness , the event was thus reported in the New York Times Annalist : " Tuesday , one-half hour before opening time , news of Germany 's move for peace leaked out . It conjured up in the minds of traders prospects as terrifying as the declaration of war . Transactions amounted to 1,019,000 on Monday . On Tuesday they went to 2,352,000 . There was a dumping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can now see how futile would be any conference called to end the armament race or to bring about disarmament . A group of premiers or diplomats sitting round a conference table confronted with a proposal of disarmament would be asked to adopt a measure which would ensure an immediate collapse in every country . The French Premier recognizes this and has admitted itfrankly . " It would be impossible to restrict the armament race without provoking the danger of a great crisis . " In a world , therefore , where the existence of economic stability now rests upon a continuance of the war effort , all talk of peace by diplomacy becomes a grim jest . III You can not of course unloose in Europe so mad a prodigal without producing some effect here . It would be manifestly untrue to say that our own recovery has been in any major way produced by war expenditures or that Europe 's war trade has furnished any determining part of the energy for our upward push . Europe has been shopping here for war materials , but no one has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such proportions that its withdrawal would cause a serious collapse . But the effects produced here are , none the less , grave . And they continue to grow more serious . They must be looked for in two sections of our economic life ? first , in the impetus given to armament in this country and second , in the direct and indirect effects upon our foreign and domestic trade . Because of the disturbed state of Europe the warrior spirit has flamed up here . It happened , by a strange coincidence , that as Europe sprang to her armaments , we named as President a man with a little-understood attitude toward military and , particularly , naval matters . It would of course be a grave injustice to Mr. Roosevelt to say that he is a militarist in the sense that Mussolini is a militarist . Mussolini is a lover of war . Mr. Roosevelt is not . But he is a lover of the instruments of war . There was a time when he favored universal military training ? the corrosive curse of Europe . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world under the spreading shadows of Mussolini and Hitler , his first acts should have been to build up a military machine . In the past four years the Army and Navy have been flourishing in their favorite preoccupation ? preparation against that mysterious and as yet unknown enemy who is one day to invade our shores . It would be ridiculous to name the armament and battleship makers as conspirators pushing Congress and the President into extravagant outlays for defense . It has not been necessary . The President has been the leader in this job . The Navy is his darling . And the first monies earmarked out of the first huge relief appropriation in 1933 were for naval construction . Let us see just how much business Americans have got out of our own war preparations . To understand this you have to look at our defense appropriations in the three years before Roosevelt and in the past three years . They are not easy to follow . The vagaries of the bookkeeping of the present Treasury officials make the scrutiny of such things difficult . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . And accounts have been shifted about from one to another in such a way that they are confusing even to those who make a business of watching them . When you read in the papers that a certain impressive sum has been allocated to Public Works you are not apt to suspect that there may be a couple of cruisers and a flock of submarines lurking in that innocuous item , as the salesman 's new overcoat hides away in his innocent-looking expense account . If you look at the expenditures for national defense for the years 1930 , 1931 , and 1932 you will come upon a total for the three years of $2,440,000,000 . But you can not compare this figure with the defense expenditures for the past three years because various expenditures which used to be marked " defense " are now carried in different accounts . For instance , before the Roosevelt bookkeeping came into being , river and harbor expenditures were allocated to the Army . Now they are carried separately , partly in the general expense account but more largely in the recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pre-Roosevelt years and the past threeyears , we have to omit the river and harbor expenses from the defense accounts and we have to make certain other adjustments . At the end of this we find that in the years 1930 , 1931 , and 1932 the federal government spent in round numbers on national defense two billion dollars , and in 1935 , 1936 , and 1937 , three billion dollars . In other words , in the past three years the government has poured into the bloodstream of American spending , and hence into business , a billion dollars on war preparations in excess of what it spent in the Hoover years . Put differently , the government has loosed into the stream of spending an average of a billion a year on war preparations ? which is $333,000,000 in excess of its previous annual expenditure . To this extent has it been stimulated by the war movements of the rest of the world . If you think this is not a great sum , then you have merely to compare our own little war industry with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as much as the value of our whole wheat crop which supported over a million wheat farmers in 1935 . It is almost twice as much as our great cotton industry 's output in 1935 . It is five times as much as the value of all our hard coal mines , and a good deal more than the combined product of our hard and soft coal mines which support over half a million men . It is greater than the value of our vast crude oil industry . And the increase per year alone ? $333,000,000 ? is enough to support one of our larger manufacturing industries . The Navy itself is very proud of this . " The money appropriated to the Navy , " it declares in a recent bulletin , " is nearly all returned to the general channels of commercial business . It serves as a stimulus to the general business of the country . " It then points out that of $90,000,000 spent in a given period for shipbuilding , $35,000,000 went to the steel industry and the balance for machinery , metal doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every State in the Union . What we are doing is evident from the following facts . Here is a simple table giving the number of war vessels under construction on January 1 , 1937 , for the various countries in the world : There remain , however , great sums appropriated for new tonnage . But here we fall a little behind . England , with her ambitious plans , passes us . However , we do quite well , for we have just provided for two more capital ships to cost $100 , - 000,000 . The truth is that the bulk of American shipbuilding is naval . Without our jittery government and its terrors of the unknown invader , shipyards would be quite empty . Of vessels of over 100 gross tons under construction about March 15th , only 30 were for private account , while the Navy had 87 . The tonnage of these private vessels is only 181,000 tons while that of the naval vessels is 276,265 tons . And now we are about to embark upon a program of shipping subsidies to stimulate the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transports in time of war . IV While it is difficult to put one 's finger on the precise spots which have benefited most , no one who looks at the daily and weekly dry-as-dust picture of foreign commerce as told in the reports can doubt the effect of Europe 's war business on our own . So far as I know , there has been no concert between rascally traders in war profits . The average business man with a product to sell is eternally in search of customers . When he secs a customer he hails him with delight and does not pause to conduct an investigation into his socialphilosophy or , for that matter , into the particular use to which he intends to put the merchandise purchased . The humble junk dealer laboriously scratching in back yards and attics for abandoned iron is not concerned with the grim fact that it is to be sold to some foreign nation to fabricate into guns and shells and that it may come back to us on its return trip in the muzzle of a machine gun to mutilate one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankers inventing stratagems to mobilize American investors behind a growing war trade . It has all come about in a most natural way . Europe has money to spend . Our exporters are more than happy to accommodate her and no questions asked . Of course there is a feeling that the immense activity in the steel industry is connected with Europe 's war trade . Steel exports have of course increased , but it is hardly true yet that much of the metal turned out of our busy mills is for foreign war demand . Up to now European warrior nations have preferred to utilize their great armament programs to activate their domestic industries . Hence they have kept business as far as possible at home . But now the whole armament industry of Europe moves into a higher tempo . Haste ? not the furious haste of 1914 , but still rising haste ? characterizes the preparation energies of Germany and France and England and Russia and Italy in these past few months . Now some of these countries have found their own resources and those of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud gathers breadth and darkness . Up to now they hardly have been willing to pay the American price for steel . But now they are not only willing but eager . Orders for steel have been coming in ever greater volume . The steel companies themselves have shown a lack of willingness to take these orders . The chief reason of course has been that they have been supplying just about all the steel they can make to domestic business . Exporters in New York say that they are being swamped from abroad with orders for steel and that some buyers are offering bonuses as high as ten per cent . England has reduced her tariff duty on steel fifty per cent and has wiped out her duties on pig iron . There is a general impression that domestic steel orders are going to taper off a bit and that when this happens the American producers will be glad to have this foreign business . The Iron Age recognizes this : " If steel were available , " it said editorially April 9th , " American producers could easily book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic business . Much of this demand can not be satisfied by European mills and will be a cushion for American mills if it should be still available when domestic demand has ceased . " This , however , is merely by way of preface . Thus far Europe has confined her purchases largely to iron to be converted into steel in her own furnaces . And she , as well as Japan , has been buying scrap iron . If , as you have motored along the highway , you have overtaken an old truck piled high with rusted bed springs , car fenders , old stoves , corroded iron pipes , and other metal junk , held fast to its creaking carrier with wire , you have in all probability passed within arm 's length of a far distant outpost of the world 's war effort . For the first commodity to feel the thrill of this war prosperity has been the scrap iron and steel business . Thus war begins its work where it ends ? with the scrap heap . You must not look with scorn upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making of steel . It is known as the surface iron mine , and these great junk mines frequently supply more iron to the steel blast furnaces than the underground mines do ore . It is not unusual for steel makers to use 60 per cent of scrap and only 40 per cent of pig iron in the conversion of metal into steel . This scrap iron and steel export business began to feel the touch of life when Japan became serious about her great mission and Hitler raised the sword again in Germany . This was in 1933 . In 1931we shipped 136,000 tons of scrap abroad . The greatest year up to then was 1929 , when we sent over half a million tons . But in 1933 , when the world set about beating its plowshares into swords , exports increased rapidly . Last year they were around two million tons . This year they will be perhaps not less than three million . For the month of March the total was 360,000 tons ? an all-time record ? three times as much as in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send abroad more scrap than in the eleven years between 1923 and 1933 combined . Of course the price has soared . It was $8 a ton in I933 ? the low point . It averaged about $15 a ton in 1935 . It averaged about $20 a ton in 1936 . It has gone as high as $25 a ton . It is around $20 as I write . How important this is you will gather from these simple facts . There are about 250,000 people , I am told by the savants of the Scrap Iron Institute , making a living out of this business ? small enterprisers at the very bottom of the industrial heap . Yet , as the output of the so-called " purchased " scrap industry this year will be around fifteen million tons , you will see that at current prices we are talking about a **26;1480;TOOLONG industry ? as big as our lumber products industry or the silk and rayon industries . The bulk . of our shipments have gone to Japan , England , and Italy . Scrap shipments have so clogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose temporary embargoes . Near Philadelphia a thousand cars loaded with scrap were tied up for lack of ships . In case you have forgotten it , it was thus the war business got under way in 1915 ? that is , in remote areas of industry . And if you think the scrap men do n't think well of this business , just talk to one of them about it . You might learn that they are prepared to send up a mighty protest if any attempt is made to prevent them from cashing in on this handsome opportunity to make the world safe for scrap iron . The business has , by the way , started up our first little war-trade row . Of course the rise in the price of scrap has hit the makers of steel in this country . And of course the steel makers do n't like that . So they are sponsoring a bill in Washington to put an end to scrap export save under presidential license . Since they have not gone very industriously after this war trade themselves , it is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap dealers in a burst of pacific hysteria that they would do well to remember that some of this junk they are selling may come back to this country as shells to kill some of our brave boys . Fine Americans , those steel men ! Into this war trade , as was inevitable , has stepped the speculator with his little bag of tricks . London , rather than New York , has been the scene of the adventures of the 1937 speculator in the materials of war . But all of these raw products , which are so innocent in themselves but which become so vital when the sabers are rattled , have come in for sensational increases in price . There is a whole host of such materials ? aluminum and tungsten and antimony and manganese and quicksilver and zinc and lead and tin and ammonium nitrate , jute , cotton linters , leather , and a number of other things . There is tungsten , to take a modest commodity . A critical scarcity has developed . It is important in the making of tool steels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scramble for the meager supplies has driven the world price up 100 per cent . Leather prices have risen 25 per cent in the past six months . This is due chiefly to the frantic demand in Europe for skins for manufacturing gas masks . A good example of the indirect effect of the European war trade on our own business is found in commodities like glycerine and copper . A year ago glycerine was selling at 141/2 cents a pound . Now it is fetching 34 cents . The chief reason is that imports of glycerine have fallenvery low , and this in turn is due to the fact that European producers are holding their supplies for war production . In the case of copper the sensational rise in price from 9 cents a year ago to a high of 17 cents before the recent break was the result of war demand . We do not , it is true , send much copper to Europe , and the copper producers did not make their money out of sales to the war builders . But the price of copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and copper prices soared in Europe because of the armament demand there . Our own went up with them . This brought a handsome sum to the copper smelters . This difference in price between 9 and /5 cents meant an increased return of around 75 million dollars to the copper producers . Of course the aviation industry has been one of the great beneficiaries . It has been seeking orders in Europe not only for planes but for parts . Following the assassination of Alexander of Yugoslavia in 1935 , advices to our government revealed that instantly American airplane and parts-makers sent their representatives rushing to Germany and that in less than 60 days they sold enough for over a thousand planes . The plane plants are working , like the arms plants in New England , three shifts a day . As a matter of fact , our whole export trade has been deeply affected by this war trade . Even though actual exports in 1936 and 1935 do not show a preponderance of war materials , the rise in our exports in 1936 was due principally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due to the recovery produced by war expenditures . Moreover , in 1936 there was a serious rise in prices of European goods needed here , much faster and higher than the price rises in our own goods . This price boost , due to the war buying , tended to increase Europe 's buying power , and the effect has been seen in every section of our export trade . To sum the matter up , the business created here by our own preparedness expenditures ? an increase of $333,000,000 a year ? plus the increase in our sales of certain war materials abroad , plus the increase in profits on commodities like copper and aluminum and glycerine and numerous other commodities which have gone up in price as a result of the scramble for those commodities in Europe ? all these together have produced enough business to more than equal the amount of war business this country had picked up from the warring nations of Europe by about the middle of 1915 . No one would have said at that point that our national economy was being shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got into our system and into our bank accounts . And presently we began to be interested in Europe 's capacity to buy from us . The next step was to lend her money . And that is the step which lies just ahead of us now . V There is little doubt that Europe 's buying here may well be restrained by her inability to pay . These warlike countries can build and recruit within their own borders so long as they can print bonds and unload them on their banks for credits . But when they step over their frontiers they must carry cash or sound commercial credits with them . They have been enabled to finance their purchases here so far in various ways . First of all , they have up to a point used gold . Second , some of these countries , like Germany and Italy , have exercised despotic dominion over their entire foreign trade exchange . Every scrap of merchandise sold by an Italian to America creates a credit here . The Italian government has assumed to avail itself of such credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to purchase . Also Italy , and in a lesser degree Germany , have seized the foreign securities owned by their nationals and have used the dividends and interest payments due on these to make purchases abroad . Then besides , as already indicated , therising prices of commodities in Europe have expanded the cost of our imports from those countries and given them a larger buying power here . But there is a limit to all this . And , in the case of England and France in particular , democratic countries which can hardly seize the foreign holdings of their citizens as the fascist dictator does , the problem of financing large purchases here will he difficult . The only way it can be done is to effect loans here ? perhaps large loans . But this is impossible as things stand now because of the Johnson law . This law prohibits loans by Americans to any nation which has defaulted on its war loans to us . This both England and France , along with all their allies save Finland , have done . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war debts . Therefore today behind the scenes , but apparently well observed by everyone , all sorts of moves are quietly in progress to arrange a debt settlement which will permit England and perhaps France , to make moderate yearly payments on their repudiated obligations . If this is done , then both England and France will be in a position to make further loans here . This of course is much like what happened in 1915 . By the middle of 1915 further purchases in America were difficult without large commercial credits first and outright longer-term loans later . Hence the first Anglo-French loan of $500,000,000 was floated in the fall of 1915 upon the alluring assurance that all of the money would be spent here in our factories . This is precisely the offer which is due to come to us again and which may actually come before this can appear in print . I do not see what can be done about this pre-war trade . It probably can not go to very disastrous lengths here unless we make loans to whip it up . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to discourage loans to any foreign nation for war purposes by every means in our power . I urge this upon purely pragmatic grounds and without any feeling either for or against any of the belligerents . Of course a section of our people deeply sympathetic with France and England will set up a sentimental clamor that it is our duty to come to the aid of the great democratic countries in a world threatened by fascism . On the other hand , the professional and hysterical foes of communism will cry out against aid to those countries which allow themselves to be drawn into communist alliances . The intelligent American will think this all out in terms of the interests of his own country , its ideals , and its relation to the civilization of the world . I hope he will bear in mind these considerations : First , no possible good can come from a boom in this country built on war trade . No man in his right mind can suppose that such a boom can last . It is bound to collapse and leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second , we have had the lesson of our last war participation . We have been the most hated nation in the world ever since that little adventure of questionable altruism . The money we loaned then has not been paid and never will be paid for the obvious reason that it can not be paid . If we make further loans , the ability of the countries borrowing from us to pay will be reduced to the extent of the loans we make . They can not pay the old loans . They will not be able to pay the new ones . They will default onthem . When the next episode comes to an end in a disaster , and we ask for our money , we shall add another load of obloquy to the old one inherited from the last war . No man likes to write in a tone of pessimism . But ahead I can see no escape from the appalling tangle into which Europe has got herself ? no escape for Europe . There is , however , an escape for us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmeshed in that tangle . I would listen to the rulers of Europe whenever they want to talk peace I would talk with them , exchange ideas with them , and trade with them . Because there is apparently no way to stop it , I would permit trade in any commodity even though it had an ultimate war use . But I would not encourage such trade and , above all , I would not permit the lending of a single penny to any nation to carry on such trade . Our safety lies in Europe 's inability to buy disastrously from us without credit . And then , should war come , I would ruthlessly restrict war trade and protect this nation by every device that ingenuity can invent , from the rise of a war-trade boom financed by the sale of American securities owned by foreign investors here or by credits from bankers , manufacturers , or lenders . I do not see how , in actual practice , we can do more than this . We shall do less at our peril .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
