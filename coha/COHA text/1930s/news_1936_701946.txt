txt The direct effect of outright devaluation abroad on the American stock market may be comparatively small , precipitating only minor withdrawals of funds immediately , official investigations indicate . On the other hand , if the gold bloc embargoes gold exports instead of devaluing overnight , the immediate result may be another rush of foreign funds and another wave of foreign buying during the ensuing period of uncertainty . Thus , the feeling here is that the effect of foreign monetary readjustments on the American security markets will depend , at the outset at least , upon the form which the initial readjustments take . Holdings Abroad Estimated Total American common stock holdings by the three gold bloc countries . France , Holland and Switzerland , were estimated by a Department of Commerce study at $552,000,000 as of the end of 1935 . Holdings on December 31 were estimated as ' follows : French , $142,000,000 ; Dutch , $196,000,000 ; Swiss , $214.000.000 . Most of these common stock holdings by citizens of the gold bloc countries represent outright investments and not hedges against possible devaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their complete liquidation . Even those foreign funds which came to this country last year may , in large part , represent outright investments rather than speculative hedges . This is indicated by a special , unpublicized study which the Department of Commerce made in conjunction with its larger investigation of foreign investments in America . This special study , covering the stocks of 50 representative companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange disclosed that during 1935 the direct foreign holdings of common stocks in these countries rose 15% , while the holdings through nominee accounts rose only 6% . If it is assumed that the division between direct and nominee holdings furnishes a rough index of " investment " as against " speculative " buying , then most of the foreign money coming into the American stock market last year was attracted by investment possibilities rather than driven here by devaluation fears . The Department itself has made no such assumption and has not used the special study as the basis for conclusions on probable stock trends , having collected the information for other purposes . The figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the foreign money going into American common stocks has been for investment rather than for devaluation , hedges . But that there has been some buying ; of American stocks by ' ' nervous " foreign capital is indicated by the fact that the common stock holdings of gold bloc countries are higher in proportion to their other investments here than are the stock holdings of countries like England and Canada . If most of the foreign funds in the stock market are there for investment rather than for refuge from devaluation , then there need not be any large scale liquidation of foreign stock holdings immediately after devaluation . The exodus of foreign funds from the market . it any develops , may be short and sharp and thereafter very gradual . Thus the direct effect of overnight devaluation might be comparatively small . Whether there are psychological factors which would outweigh the direct effects is another matter . There is understood here to be a widespread disposition to regard devaluation as a signal for selling American stocks .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
