The House Committee on Un-American Activities headed by ham-handed Representative Martin Dies of Texas , after hearings in Washington which revealed it as nothing but an ill-planned , amateurish Red-hunt , last week heard some news of fascist propaganda but soon got back to its Red theme . From the testimony of Joseph B. Matthews , onetime head of the League Against War &; Fascism ( now League for Peace &; Democracy ) , the Committee learned that " the Communist Party relies heavily upon the carelessness or indifference of thousands of prominent citizens in lending their names for its propaganda purposes . For example , the French newspaper Ce Soir , which is owned outright by the Communist Party , recently featured hearty greetings from Clark Gable , Robert Taylor , James Cagney and even Shirley Temple . " <P> Soon afterward the Committee , having finished its work in Washington , announced that it would use up what remains of its $25,000 appropriation traveling , and one stop , announced Chairman Dies , would be Hollywood . <P> Arriving in Tacoma full of beans after junketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the intra-Democratic dogfight with an unexpected assault upon tart old Senator Carter Glass of Virginia . " The reactionary press , " said Mr. Ickes , " hails this ' rugged individual ' as another Horatius-at-the-Bridge because of his bitter attacks on economic policies of the Government . Yet no Senator comes oftener and with more insistence for PWA grants than this same Senator Glass . " From his home in Lynchburg , back cracked Senator Glass , overflowing with indignation and invective : " Secretary Ickes has become a confirmed blackguard , saturated with hate for every member of Congress who voted against spendthrift practices of the New Deal authorities and against projecting the Government into every conceivable species of business . His statement concerning me is simply a wanton falsehood . I doubt if there is a member of Congress who has had less than I to do with so-called Government grants . . . . Horatius-at-the-Bridge stood and fought ; he did not go 3,000 miles across the continent to lie about his adversaries . " <P> John Coolidge , 32 , son of the 30th President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haven &; Hartford R. R. , returned to his home in Orange , Conn. one day last week to find that his colleagues on the Grange Town Committee had delegated him to attend the Republican State Convention . Said John Coolidge : " I 'll be glad to do whatever I can-locally-to keep the Republican party alive . " <P> In Cambridge , Mass . Democrat Thomas H. Leary , also without his knowledge or consent , was made a candidate for his party 's State Convention . Democrat Leary promptly made a campaign speech , " I 'm against me . " Announced his slogan , " Be wary of Leary. "
