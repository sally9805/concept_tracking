Dream House <P> Sirs : <P> As a 13-year-old student interested in architecture , enclosed plan will disclose additional errors to those indicated in TIME ( Oct. 17 ) . <P> My plan see cut would give a bathroom common to both bedrooms and a closet for each . Also permitting the bedrooms to obtain westerly view . The cook would find both his kitchen and bedroom much more convenient and comfortable in my plans . <P> WILLIAM KRISEL <P> Beverly Hills , Calif . <P> &gt;TIME applauds Student Krisel 's attempt but prefers Franklin Roosevelt 's own plans of his Hyde Park " dream house . " Some objections to the Krisel plan : the kitchen is too narrow , the pantry at the wrong end , windows badly spaced , partitions awkwardly arranged ; and there is no way into the farther bedroom except through the nearer one. - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> Architects Roosevelt and Toombs , both nonprofessional and professional , as well as TIME , have overlooked both dining room and breakfast room in Architect Roosevelt 's dream house . <P> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantry or kitchen . <P> HERBERT MARCUS JR . <P> Dallas , Texas <P> &gt;Architect Roosevelt deliberately omitted a dining room from his plans , will eat breakfast in bed , other meals in the living room or on the terrace. - ED . <P> Keynote <P> Sirs : <P> You print Chamberlain 's " Keynote " ( TIME , Oct. 17 , p. 22 ) with no hint that it is a quotation . See Shakespeare 's Measure for Measure , II , ii , 107 ff : <P> " O , it is excellent To have a giant 's strength ; but it is <P> tyrannous <P> To use it like a giant . " <P> One wonders if ( had he quoted it to Hitler ) the German would have replied with Lucio 's aside . <P> ROBERT WITHINGTON <P> Northampton , Mass . <P> &gt; Said Lucio : " That 's well said . " - ED . <P> Epithet <P> Potbellied Sirs : <P> Naturally , if you are not potbellied , the epithet rolls off you like water from a duck 's back . But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children say , " I hope that stang ! " That is your modus operandi ! How do you like it applied to yourself ? I hope it raises your blood pressure . <P> FLORENCE KRANZ <P> Hollywood , Calif . <P> &gt; Sorry ; just like a duck. - ED . <P> Times Change <P> Sirs : <P> Times change . Things are different today . Looking through The Saturday Evening Post of Oct. 5 I find the following ads- Boston Garter , Daisy Air Rifle , Chiclets , Holeproof Hosiery , Lea &; Perrins , Florsheim Shoes , Van Camp 's Pork &; Beans , Packard cars , Gold Medal Flour etc. , etc . The first 31 words of the first editorial entitled " The Howl and the Howlers , " are " Glancing casually over a day 's news we learn that investors , not knowing what Roosevelt will do next , fear ' that the little of value that is left to them will soon vanish . ' " <P> That from the S.E.P . of Oct. 5 , 1907 . <P> I submit this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not giving too much aid and comfort to the enemy . <P> Times change ? Things are different to-day ? <P> CHARLES HALL <P> New York City <P> Song <P> Sirs :
