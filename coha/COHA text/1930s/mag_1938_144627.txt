Eleven years ago Emil Marek lost a leg . This was not the hard luck it might have seemed , for it enabled him to collect $42,875 in insurance to finance an invention . The invention failed and not long afterward he fell ill and died . In fairly rapid succession , so did his 3-year-old daughter , Ingeborg ; an aunt , Suzanne Loewenstein ; and the family seamstress , Anna Kittenberger . In each case Mrs. Martha Marek was in close attendance . Last week in Vienna a horrified Nazi judge put an end to Frau Marek 's ghastly livelihood . For it was she who had sliced off her husband 's leg , she who had killed daughter , aunt and seamstress-all to collect insurance . Excoriated as a " devil in petticoats , " a " human cobra , " Frau Marek was sentenced to death .
