As late as September of last year there were indications that the common share earnings of the system would equal if not exceed those of 1930 . The results for the last two months , however , were somewhat below expectations , probably due in part to unseasonal weather with a corollary lessened use of service compared to a normal period . The fact that the Consolidated Gas System was able in a year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorable showing speaks well for the stability of its operations Load Building Successful It is quite possible that when the final results are tabulated those produced by Consolidated Gas of New York will have recorded the best showing for the industry as a whole .

Permanent Financing Arranged Early this year , however , the management took steps to fund permanently the loans incurred by the 1931 program through bond financing by two subsidiaries , the New York Edison Co. , and the Brooklyn Edison Co . The New York Edison Co. already has sold $25,000,000 of 5% bonds , and . in issue of a like amount will be forthcoming shortly under the name of the Brooklyn Edison Co .
