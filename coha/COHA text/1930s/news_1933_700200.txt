txt The administration today set in motion its program of buying gold in the world markets , coupling the first steps with assurances that it was not the purpose unduly to disturb the finances of any country . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , it was made known , has broad latitude , as fiscal agent for the RFC , in carrying out the operations , including the price which will be paid for gold acquired abroad . It was intimated that there would be no publicity for day-to-day transactions , and no confirmation could be obtained here of reports from Paris that small purchases actually had been made there and in London today . In cCinnection with purchases of gold newly mined in 4. ' te United States , however , it was stated at the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that about 66,000 ounces had been acquired up to yesterday at a cost of about $2,100,000 , or an average of $31.818 an ounce . This represented an expenditure of $735,780 in excess of what the gold would have cost at the statutory price of $20.67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large part of the gold will be disposed of 1 to the arts and industries at about the price paid by the RFC , the element of loss , even if later gold prices head downward , might not be great . RFC Raises Price 10 Cents . Another increase was made today in the price at which the RFC will buy the newly mined gold , the figure being fixed at $32.36 an ounce , as compared with $32.26 yes : terday . Today 's quotation was $1 ! an ounce above the level quoted when the program was started a week ago yesterday . Backers of the President 's program found satisfaction in the fact that bullion quotations at London rose in dol1 lars from $31.50 yesterday to $32.11 ; today , or only 25 cents under the ' domestic price here . The manner in which the Federal Reserve Bank will carry on its operations for the RFC was not I clearly defined in any official circles , but the understanding is that it will deal with member banks in New York of the Federal Reserve System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive notes of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in return . Such gold either will be actually imported into the United States for the RFC or earmarked and held abroad for that corporation . Notes I of the RFC which would be used I in the transactions would be guar ! anteed by the Treasury . The question whether dealings abroad will be carried out through 1 the Central European banks , such 1 as the Bank of England- and the Bank of France , was not formally cleared ' up , but it is the belief that these institutions will agree to collaborate so long as the transactions are kept within limits to which they do not seriously object . And the emphasis here today was that the intent is to carry on only smallscale operations . Less Danger of Reprisals Seen . Whether such relatively small purchases will accomplish the President 's purpose of keeping the gold value of the dollar at a low level , and bring about a gradual raising of commodity prices appeared uncertain to some officials . It was felt , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in the dollar , and send it to a low level in its relationship to other currcenci es . The fact that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a free hand , for the present at least , was received as a reassuring development by those opposed to having purchases abroad go to the extreme which might bring on reprisals . It was said that there has been no amount fixed for the purchases , but that this had been left to the Reserve bank . Under these circumstances it is felt here that the , program will be carefully carried out , and that little factual information will be made public as to the actual extent of the transactions or the prices paid for the gold . Publicity of daily transactions , one official said , might prove a disturbing factor and tend to defeat the general aim . In one official quarter it was explained that an abrupt rise in commodity prices was not to be expected , even though some success met the effort to cheapen the dollar .

For farm products the index was 55.6 , as compared with 54.2 . While the machinery for world market gold purchases was being started President Roosevelt discussed his new monetary program with Henry Morgenthau Jr. , governor of the Farm Credit Administration ; Henry Bruere , New York banker called here to aid in the coordination of credit activities ; J. H. Rand Jr . of the RemingtonRand Company , and R. E. Wood , president of Sears , Roebuck &; Co .
