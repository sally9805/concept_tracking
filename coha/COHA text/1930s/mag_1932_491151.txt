6 THE SRTURDRY EVENING POST February 27,1932 ILLUSTR-NTED BY WY1VCIE KING VANC 01 ' V E rt . B. C. Nov. 20 , 1931 . D EAR Senator Borah : Well , your One-Man mission is on its way ; I am getting out of here in the morning on the Empress of Russia . I just wanted to drop you a line before I pushed off . There is a few things that ought . to be straightened out between both of us , so we will have it clear just what I am to do , and why . As you know , I took this position with you after weigh  --  ing the whole thing over care  --  fully . As you also know , I could have gone over for Her  --  bert on about the same terms that 1 went over to Europe in 1926 for Calvin . That was , pay my own expenses and split what 1 got out of the letters with him . But darn this thing of continually working for our President  --  that 's what we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Cabinet and there is no way of getting out ; those fellows have to stay there and take it on the chin . But with me it 's different . Now , here is a few of the plain reasons that I dident want . to go for the President : In the first place , there is no novelty to it ; you are just another Hoover Commission . Now , that handicaps you right there : you hand a fellow your card , MR . WILLIAM PENN ADAIR ROGERS , CHAIR  --  MAN , HOOVER COMMISSION FOR INVESTIGATING ALL DEPRESSION WEST OF PACIFIC OCEAN . Now , the fellow you hand it to is going to laugh , for he sees bands of such men every day ; Highways , Railways , and even Oceans are clogged up with Commissions going somewhere to see why somebody else is doing as bad as they are . They are not all Hoover Commis  --  sions , of course  --  only about 95 per cent  --  but it was him that started it . He got other folks doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , for most of the folks he would appoint was laying off any  --  how , and even a job on a Commission looked better than nothing . He first started out by only putting Big Men on ' em  --  that is , what we thought was Big Men then  --  and they was , as long as every  --  thing was going good . But when the blow-up come , noth  --  ing went as high and fell as flat as Big Men . Well , the Big Men dident know any more about stop  --  ping it than they knew about prevent  --  ing it before it hap  --  pened . And , too , the Big Men had run out of Predictions , so middle-sized and Little Men got so they could get on Commissions . They couldent do any more than the Big Ones , but it was a compliment to ' em to be there . Of course , they would not have been there if the case hadent been hopeless any  --  how . But lately they draft men to get ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of his own free will and accord . But you ca n't blame Mr. Hoover . It looked like a good thing to do at the time , and I doubt if we would have been any better off without ' em . For they revived hopes for a while . Of course , they did collect a lot of what they call Data , but most of the Data was bad , so there was no use collecting it . It 's like garbage ; there is no use collecting it if you ai n't going to do anything with it after you get it collected . You see , there really wasent anything you could do . It was just Commission coming into the Hospital with another epidemic case , when they had found no cure for the others ; it was just as well to let him die at home . But the cards was stacked against . Mr. Hoover : not only against him but every Nation . The Lord was wise to the World and he just wanted to show ' em that. , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Stock Exchange . Well , that was a terrible blow to finance to learn that the Lord not only closed the Market on Sundays , but practically closed it on week days . So , you see , Com  --  missions were not to blame for all our ills . They did , however , draw people 's attention to ' em . Now , for instance , there is an awful lot of things wrong with us that if we hadent picked up a Paper and seen where a Commission had been appointed to investi gate it , why , we wouldent maby have known we had it . Of course Wickersham 's bunch will hold the record for this and all time , for finding out exactly what everybody already knew . done about their Report , ex- Of course , nothing was ever eept they say one man at Mattewan actually read it clear through . Then he did something about it ; he made a bonfire that lasted a week . But what I am trying to get at , Senator , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protec tive Tariffs in Ala bama . Commissions have contributed more to humor than they have to achievement in American life . So that 's why I dident want to just go out to the Orient as " Just an other Hoover Commis sion . " I like him , mind , and wouldent mind working for him ; every body that has ever been connected with him in a working ca pacity has the greatest respect and admiration for him . Even Smedley Butler , the Hero of the real old fighting Marines , couldent get any more followers to go with him into battle than Mr. Hoover can among his Coworkers . So , you see , there is nothing personal about my turn  --  ing down this job with him ; it was just that I wanted more distinction than a Hoover Commission could give . And , besides , I do n't like to play Medicine Ball early in the morning . I think that early morn  --  ing , say from seven to eight , was meant for sleeping . That 's when I do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eight A.M. Then , there is another thing . When I worked for Calvin that time , / was about the only one he had out . You wasent confused with any other Coolidge Commission . When I went up to Ben  --  ito Mussolini and said , " I am here in the interest of Cal  --  vin Coolidge , " it meant something . It dident mean there had been twelve other Commissions there ahead of me that day . You see , Mr. Coolidge wasent a Commis  --  sion man ; he was a man that dident want to know what was going on . He knew that it was going to go on whether he knew it or not , and he dident want to do anything that might keep it from going on . You never caught him appointing any Prohibition Commission . No , sir ; he just said , " I was elected to veto Bills ; I wasent elected to count the drinks . " He believed that Nature elected him , and he was going to let Nature take its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the League of Nations wouldent enforce birth con  --  trol in Abyssinia , you wouldent catch Calvin sending a Commission down there to bring back the Data . No , sir , if Wall Street sold , Short , Long or Crooked , you never caught Calvin even reading about it . He just said , " What is , is , and I am not going to try to un-is it . " So I guess I am about the only one that ever found out anything for him , and I dident find out enough to worry him . It was just that he wanted a little check-up on Europe . I even went into Russia for him  --  that was before they had their Five-Year Plan . They was just messing along a good deal like we are now , without any plan . But . it was a pleasure to work with Mr. Coolidge ; he never bothered you . In fact , when I talked to him he never even bothered enough to answer me . But what I am getting at is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with him . Did you know that Mussolini , Charley Chaplin and yourself , Senator , are about the only big men that have held up over that stretch of years ? King of Spain has had some good luck ; when somebody knocks , he can go to the door now and open it without peeping out the window first to see who it is . But even the Prince of Wales has lost his appeal among the Young Girls . But , of course , gained additionally with the middle-aged married women . So , you see , Senator , that is why I picked you to go look things over for . I couldent work for Chaplin , for he looks ' em over for himself , and marries most of ' em . Grandi is working for Mussolini , and he was over here . And he was practically on the same sort of a mission for the Pre-rider as I am for you . About the only dif  --  ference , I am clean-shaved . Now the question will be asked , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Well , I am a man that wants to go with the best . What 's the use of going all over Eu  --  rope , or all over Mount Fuji-yama , or Man  --  churia , or the Walls of China , or that long Barroom in Shang  --  hai , if , when I get hack and turn it over to somebody like Mr. Coolidge or Mr. Hoover , or Mr. Smith , or Mr. Roosevelt , or Mr. Baker , they , in turn , ca n't do anything about it ; they have to turn it over to you anyhow . You know , yourself , that all my Coolidge reports had to go right on UP to you . So , I am getting tired of that ; I says , " Here ; what 's the use of my prowling and writing , and then have to have them go first to a mere Supernumiary ? ? there is a good word , Senator , that was brought over here to Canada by the English . So I just says , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to work for the Head Man . " You , as Chairman of the United States For  --  eign Relations Committee , are the Guy that does business with everything outside of the United States and Idaho . When Mr. Lavall comes , it 's Mr. Hoover that gives him the Dinner , but it 's Mr. Borah that tells him that " I am very sorry , but you ca n't get away with it . " It 's the Presi  --  dent they have their Picture taken with , but it 's you that vetoes their schemes . You see , where I got all this idea first was when I was in Europe that time I just been speaking mail , but to use  --  and Frenchman that he forgets to keep saying " Como ? " Why , you got me into Russia , and , better still , you got me out . Why , I got so I showed the letter in Cafes and they can  --  celled the Bill ; they figured it was money well spent , at that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ware out the original one just showing it . Then I copied off one myself  --  only I added to the new one and made it look like I was your Col. House . Well , then , that was the last word in service that I would get . So that showed me that you was the Fair-Haired Boy in all these Countrys that want something . Now , that 's not handing you any Boquets ; it 's the real facts . You see , we do n't have a Prime Min  --  ister that looks after all those things like these other Nations have . But you , as head of the Foreign Relations Com  --  mittee , come nearer to it than anyone they know , and so they just naturally think you are our Prime Minister . You see , France has a Pres  --  ident. , too , but we never know who he is , and neither do most of them ; and they get to thinking that our President is more like him  --  sorter decorative . They do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for every  --  thing that happens , whether it he in the Sky , on the Earth , or in a Senate Com  --  mittee Room . You see , it 's not our President 's fault . that they are not known as well in Europe as you are ; they are not in all the time like you are . The minute it 's not raining enough and we ca n't raise anything , or it 's raining too much and we raise to much , why , we throw our President . out and get a new one . So the World is naturally not . supposed to keep track of all our foolishness . But they do know who has to 0 . K. any foreign skullduggery that 's going on with us . It 's Mr. Long  --  haired Borah . They know that an election in America is no more going to effect you than a League of Nations ' decision would Japan . They know what happened to the one man that voted against you in 1920 . If we had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would naturally he known well too . So that 's why I just says to myself , when I got your offer to " Snoop the Orient , " " Fathom the Far East " and " Puncture the Phil lipines " ? " Why , " I says , " me for that job . " So , when I say I am the Head , Tail , Chairman and Executive Committee of the Bill Borah Conservation of Foreign Entanglements Commission , why , brother , I will command respect . From what I gather from what you wrote me. we not only do n't want to con serve our Relations with ' em but curtail ' em if possible . In other words , we got too many relations with ' em now . It 's great to be friendly with a For eign Nation , but it 's terribly expensive . If the worst comes to the worst and we do have to be friends with any of ' em , why , I will pick out . little ones that havent got the nerve to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the Big Ones that our relations have already become so financially entwined that they have no use for us anyhow , why , I will try and keep what they call at these Conferences the " Status Quo . " It 's an old Cherokee word that means : " This thing had gone far enough ; let 's go hack to where we started from , and next time we will watch each other closer . " So , with the ones we are already in had with , I will keep the Status Quo , and with any others I will watch ' em first . So my busi ness is not to increase our Foreign Relations but abolish ' em entirely . Of course , the Orient , where I head for first , is not in our immediate clutches financially as some of our nearer Sis ters . It only shows you the nearer you are the more you become en tangled . That goes for all but Canada , where I am writing this now . They have truly been a good Companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they havent borrowed enough from us to he called Neigh bors ; I would prefer to still call ' em Friends . They are a fine tribe of people . They are hardy they got to be to live next to us and exist ; they have made a. great showing with a few people over a tremendous area . The whole of New York City , where SO per cent of our wealthy people are in storage , if you turned ' em loose in Can  --  ada on their own re  --  sources , it would be fifty years before one would ( Continued on Page 44 ) ( Continued from Page 7 ) get far enough away from Toronto to discover Lake Erie . No , Canadians are built of sturdier stock ; they have suf  --  fered more than their share ; they fur  --  nished more than their share of men and money in the Great War . Their example was a cause of real admira  --  tion to all our Country . Then they come home , and wheat and timber prices blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you can for ' em sometime  --  that is , of course , if it 's just a favor and do n't cost much . So , you see , I am turning in my first report mighty quick after leaving home . ' Course , I havent looked over so terrible much of Canada . I just crossed the Eine down here about twenty miles this evening in an aero  --  plane , and just had time to see a little of Vancouver before dark , but these are my findings , and this is my report as I find this Country . You see , it ai n't going to take me long to look a Coun  --  try over . I am not going to be like a Commission  --  take evidence on both sides . That . way you just become con  --  fused and do n't know which side is ly  --  ing , and you go away not knowing any more than when you come . That 's why Juries should decide a case the minute they are sworn in , before the Lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why I can size up Canada so quick , and maby give ' em a squarer deal than if I stopped and listened to everybody . I flew up here , Senator , from Los Angeles . Your old Toastmaster of the Senate , Charley Curtis . was out there when I left , kinder looking over the movie situation . Ever once in a while they can use a good Lawyer  --  and maby about next November ? Well , he was just getting his application in early . Charley is a good Injun . He be  --  longs to the Kaw tribe , but there 's not . enough of ' em to get much from the Government politically . When be was out there , he dident know whether to stay with Hoover next fail or stay with Kansas and run for the Senate Well , I been to a lot of gatherings and meet  --  ings , and it 's as if somebody says to me , " The Hall is pretty crowded . I can give you a seat . down in the Auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a chance , maby I can fix you up with a seat on the Rostrum . " Charley do n't want to get off the Rostrum if he can help it , but , on the other hand , he do n't want to he left out of the Hall entirely ; so he may take a seat in the Auditorium . But all this , Senator , has nothing to do with me or my trip . I could sit here and write inquiries to you about Polities and all that Hooey all night , but I got to get up early in the morning and get ready to cross one of our big  --  gest and best-known Oceans . I am here at the C. P. Railroad Hotel . You know , these Railroads , when they built into a Country up here , they built tip the whole Town  --  Hotels , Hospitals , Clubs  --  everything . They dident just put in a place to sell you a ticket . You know , I know all this will be interesting to you , Senator , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we made you Chairman of the Foreign Re  --  lations Committee . But , Look ! The fellow that wrote the best book on Lincoln was an Englishman  --  well , not the best , but next to Sandberg 's , it was  --  the fellows that wrote the good play about Hollywood , Once in a Life  --  time , have never even been as far west as Chicago . So I think it 's good you do n't get anywhere . I would just go on doing like you do  --  drop out to Idaho every few years ; ' course , as you get older and the trip gets harder , why , just mail ' em out some Post Cards . But I would kinder keep in touch with the old home . Boise is a mighty pretty little Town ; I been there . Ground kinder sandy , built . in on a right pretty creek , bluff up on one side . . . . That ai n't where you live , is it , Senator ? . . . I met the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and got you scrubbed up , and hog-tied you and got some shoes on you , but no sox , and run you for the Legislature . He is dead , I hear , now , but he was mighty proud of you . He showed me lots of clippings and letters from you . He said sometimes you would get kinder boneheded and stiff-necked , and get off on the wrong track , and he would have to bring you back to taw with a stiff Editorial . And , he said , lots of times you would take after a rabbit when he took you deer hunting ; said that was your only failing . But take it all in all , he was mighty proud of his Pupil . He had a mighty smart . daugh  --  ter that was a mighty keen politican herself . Is she still there ? Give her my regards , will you ? I think she was unmarried . That 's not why I want you to give her my regards . But she was then . Yes , Senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in touch with the Thrasher Hands and the Boys with the Lambing Jackets on . They are the ones that put you in there with those 95 other Hyenas . Of course , that you have risen from just one of ' em is due to your own effort . I imagine it 's one of the hardest things in the World to keep from being just another Senator , but you have done it , and you deserve all the visits you get from Laval ' , and Grandi , and McDonald , and little Gandi , if he ever gets over here with his goat . Oh , yes ; I like to forgot ; what I started to tell you a while ago , about these railroads up here in Canada , there is two of ' ens  --  the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National  --  it 's now gov  --  ernment owned. ? But they were orig  --  inally two separate , privately owned , and what one would do the other would do . If one built a big Hotel on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain . One started out to get to the Pacific Ocean , and the other one took out after it .. Canada , north and south , is about as wide as the whole U. S. , including Cen  --  tral and South America thrown in , so , did these R. R. 's scatter out so they could cover some opposition territory ? No , sir , not these Bahys . They just took after each other and went west hand in hand . One place they come to a Mountain , and they had to split for a few miles. , But it liked to broke the Directors ' heart , and they got back together on the other side , and were chummier than ever from there on . If one went through a town , the other one would go through it. , too ; even if there wasent enough room in the town for only one track the other would . tun  --  nell under . If one had a steamship line , the other one put one in . But he couldent run it till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run his , so he could go the same place . That must have been Englishmen or Americans did that . I do n't believe a Canadian did . It was that dogged de  --  termination of the English that said " Anywhere you go , I can go , " and they generally do , and in this case they sure did . But they are mighty fine lines , got good Hotels , good Boats . Of course , they are not doing so well now , but neither is Ford or Rockefeller . And to this day you can go clear across the vast stretches of Canada by rail ; in fact , you can ride tandem , one foot on the C. P. R. R .. train the other on the Canadian . But if you want , to go north and south , You better get a horse , tie some snowshoes on behind you , and . light out . But. , say , wait a minute . Let me horn in here with my pet subject . They are doing a lot of flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ; so they told me here tonight , when I landed at as fine a field as you want to see . This should be the ideal Country for flying , with all these long stretches to make , an Amphibian Oh , pardon me , Senator , that 's a Plane that can land on either land or water ; I mean , that can land on either purposely . Any of ' em can do it , but not continuously with the same plane . That 's a fine line that I come up on Yes  --  terday from Los Angeles to Seattle too . Mountain Country is mighty pretty to fly over , if you can just stop yourself from continually looking for landing fields  --  which you never find . If you get a little chance , Senator , with Home Relations , you want to give some of those lines a little Subsidy . They are doing a fine pioneering work . ' Course , do n't do it till Andy gets in a little better shape . He ai n't ? in any condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow as far in the hole ? I kinder hate to be going away off over that far when I could stay at home and go to Washington and see your Show . Let 's see , you all are going to meet next week . I figure this ought to be one of the best sessions , for the Au  --  dien cesthatyou h aye ever held . ' Course , it will he a ' tough session on the Tax  --  payers , but there will be many a laugh for the Gallery . It looks like , as I am leaving , that the Democrats will have more Members in the Chorus than the Republicans . The Republicans did have the most a couple of months ago , but a lot of them died . Looked like they did it purposely , just to keep from being accused of belonging to that body . But the Democrats  --  you ca n't shame them into even dying . They would keep on living just to spite the Republicans . You know , Senator , here is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Democrats WANT to be in control of things this session . You see , if they get control , why , they also inherit , the blame for the deyilement . Now , if they wasent in charge , why , they could , of course , as usual committ the devile  --  ment , but the blame would fall on the other Party . And with the election coming on this fall , that makes ' em careful . If it was at last year 's session , they would know the Voters couldent remember that long , but they do figure that a voter 's mind can retain from winter to fall . So the Boys will all be walking on eggs , and I sure hate to miss it . But I figure that I will get back from over there about the time that all the Relief Bills have been read . Just think , if a hungry man had to stand outside and wait , not till he gets relief but just till all the Plans for relief was read . If the hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lem for the whole winter . But I am getting sleepy now , and I got to get up and catch that Boat . May drop you a line before I get away . Now , I hope everything is all clear between us , and I am going to try and find out all I can for you . Yours . WILL . VICTORIA , B. C. AR SENATOR : This is written on the Boat , and I will drop it off at Victoria . That 's an English Town located on an Island off Canada . Ca  --  nadians have to get a passport to go over there . Tasmania  --  that 's an Island away off down south of Australia . Well , it was at one time England 's Prison Colony ; they sent their Prison  --  ers there . But in addition to their Prisoners in England , they have an  --  other breed that they always get rid of , and that is about their Third Son  --  I am referring now to the better Fami  --  lies . Well , the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has to be pretty handy with a Teacup and he able to get into a Dinner Jacket the minute it starts getting dark , even if it 's an eclipse happening in the middle of the day . I have seen an Englishman just automatically get their Monkey Suit on . The Second Son generally goes into the Army or Navy , depending kinder on which branch his Father pre  --  fers ; but about the Third Son , and from then on down , they are in for a trip . They bundle them off , and they are what they call Remittance Men . They generally try to get ' em as far away from the rest of the family as possible . Well , Victoria , B. C. , is just about as far as you can go west unless you have fins . Not only is Victoria far away but that B. C. , as you remember ? But I doubt if you do , being a Senator ; I doubt if you have ever read the book ; but there is a book that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells quite a bit of what happened around and after B. C. Now , we United Staters There is another thing 1 want to call your at tention to , Senator , that I learned from the late and GREAT Dwight , Morrow . There was A Man . I may bring up later on , in my advice to you , as to how he solved lots of problems that the State Department thought was Diplomatic. , but that Morrow told me in Mexico , that they were nothing but a plain little bit of everyday busi  --  ness , the same as other business men solve every day . But they get ' em solved because they do n't call ' em " Diplomatic . " Ah , you would have liked that fel  --  low Morrow , Senator . Too bad you other Senators were too busy talking to meet him and get acquainted with him while he was sitting there listening to you all that time , and having a quiet laugh . In fact , I think that 's what made him ill , was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit him to exhale  --  that it finally impared his heltb . Well , you would , perhaps , got to meet him if he had lived , for in 1930 he is the one that you would have been going to have breakfast with , to report as to what you had done the last few days in regard to funding debts from the late Russio-Japanese War , the late Italy-France Embryo , and various others of the late wars . But what I started to tell you was about one of the many things I learned from him . He was never Ambassador from America to Mexico . He always ( Continued an Page 40 ) THE SATURDAY EVENING POST ( Continued from Page 44 ) insisted that he was Ambassador from the United States of North America . to Mexico  --  lot of difference there , see ? Mexico kinder figures that she is in America , too ; and they have some legitimate claim to the fact . Then there is all the Central and South American Countries . When we call ours " America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sort of distant way America too . So he always paid the other Nations the compliment of saying that he was " from the U. S. of North America . " So that is just a tip for you , Senator . We are not the whole of America . we are just a part . of the U. S. of North America . So remember that , will you , Senator ? And as For  --  eign Relations Head you are liable to make a lot of friends by following this advice . And Senators could use a friend now and again  --  not only could but do when they can accidentally find one . But later on I may tip you off to a lot of things that Morrow did that a Diplomat dident. do . In fact. , he told me one time that he dident believe he would have had the nerve to tackle the job , if it . was not that he had the example of Diplomats to watch , so that he could do the opposite and feel sure of success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before I got off on this United States business , was that we in the United States never could figure out just why the British would want to root these later-day Sons of theirs off . We always figured  --  that is , the ones of us that had met the First Son  --  that they sent away the wrong Son ; for some of these later ones are mighty fine fellows and turn into good Citizens , and in lots of cases go back and bail out of hock the favored Son . But there is no understanding people , Senator ; it always will seem funny to us United Staters that we are about the only ones that really know how to do everything right . I do n't know how a lot of these other Nations have existed as long as they have till we could get some of our people around and show ' em really bow to be Pure and Good like us . So , you see , Senator , in leaving home , I had no more than traveled one day than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs of two foreign Coun  --  tries  --  Vancouver , Canada , and Vic  --  toria , England , B. C. ? the B. C. means , Before Canada . Well , before we sailed today I stirred around the town quite a bit ; went to a bookstore and layed in a supply For the Boat , . Told the fellow I wanted something of a historical na  --  ture that delt with Our United States , for I wasent very well posted on our History , and in ease 1 got into an argument  --  ment in the smoking room of the Boat  --  not over who would pay the check , but about some part of our His  --  tory in comparison to theirs  --  why , I wanted to be well-healed with some historical data . So the Canadian Bookseller gave me Cross Marks the Spot , by an Author who not only knew America but had a Camera . The One-Way Ride was an  --  other historical best seller ; Al Capone , the Man , by the same Author that gave is the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book had brought in enough that it made it pos  --  sible for him to keep on writing of some of our earlier Characters . Hooey and Applesauce , a best . seller , he told me , that delt with inner workings and skull  --  duggery of highly paid officials of our National Capitol . Washington a Wash  --  out was another of the same scholastic value . Why Wo Ca n't Catch ' Em at Itwas , the clerk told me , a true story of Democratic official life in New York City , written by a Republican who had been on 234 Republican Investigation Committees . It was a very frank ex  --  posure , by the Author , who just ad  --  mitted he was too Dumb ; that he knew the City Hall was being carried away , but they couldent prove just what Street it was being carted down . Then he sold me a giant affair of twenty-four Volumes , called , What 's the Matter With the United States ? Also a little short  --  practically a Pamphlet  --  called I Saw It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Author Himself . An  --  other called Do n't Shoot the Piano Player ; He is Doing the Best He Can , by Herbert Hoover , a Mining En  --  gineer . Another he sold me was , Jesse James Would Have Been an Ameteur Had He Lived to Today ; How I Made Agriculture Pay , and HOW , by the Farm Board ; We Got to Get Back To Fundamentals , and Model T 's , by Henry Ford . Another Best Seller was , The Time , the Place , but Where the ? is the Man ? written by the Democratic National Committee . He had a lot more there that delt with our type of Civilization . But I figured that after I got through these , I would be in shape to step into any kind of foreign party and pass as a College Proffessor . I would be so well informed on America , her habits and customs , they would perhaps take me for an English Novelist and Lecturer . He was to deliver them all to the Boat .. Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Treatiste in thirty-six Volumes that I ca n't sell , and as you will per  --  haps recall some of them , I will give ' em to you . " Predictions That We Have Made That Have Gone Wrong on Us , by 100 Ex-Prominent Amer  --  icans . Sure enough , the Bookseller was right ; I picked up a Volume of it  --  look both hands to do it  --  and just casually turned its pages , and there was some of the old , remembered Babies : " This Country is Fundamentally Sound , and you ca n't keep it Down . " . . . You remember that old Bird , do n't you ? .. " Prosperity is right around the Corner , and We must have Confidence . " . . . How many years was it that that one did service ? . . . " It 's only in the Minds of the People . " . . . You re  --  call that one , do n't you ? . . . " If everybody would spend what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was uttered by a Man that dident have anything . . . " Why , I can remem  --  ber in ' 93 ? " " It 's not Hunger the people have ; it 's Sciocology . " . . . Well , I shut the book up and told him , as they were free , to send ' em down to the Boat , and I would give ' em out to the other Passengers for a Laugh when they was seasick ; there might be one in there : " Why , it 's not seasickness that 's worrying you ; it 's a state of mind . " Well , we shoved off right on time , and started across those beautiful in  --  lets and bays ; they say you can go clear to Alaska on what they call the Inland Passage . I wish to the Lord we could go to Japan by one . On the Atlantic I generally get seasick just as they are pulling up the anchor . But I stood it out pretty good today , so I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out everything I could on this trip that would be of interest to Americans  --  Beg pardon , " United Stators . " Well , I started right out , soon as I got on the boat , to find-out all I could that would interest us U. S.-ers , and 1 found it . Yes , sir , right away ; it wasent a Big Bar but it looked like it had a lot be  --  hind it . It was what I would call a ( Continued on Page 49 ) ( Con tin ued front Page 46 ) Bar with a good Background . At first I couldent see it ; I could just read the sign over the heads of the other U. S.- ers . I finally pushed enough of ' ern out of the way till I could get close enough to give you an accurate report . ' Course I had to get some evidence ; this might be like a soda fountain down home , where , if you do n't know the Sign or the Caretaker , you are liable to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne ; only you dident have to know this fellow , or even how many raps to give on the counter . I could tell right away that the other Clients there were U. S.-ers , for they kept referring to " Liberty " and the " Persuit of Happiness . " I couldent get in the conversation at first  --  every  --  thing that I said was drowned out by the gargling from glasses . Finally I thought of a way that might get me some measure of recog  --  nition . I said , " Boys and Girls " ? for by this time they had discovered where to find their Husbands , and was repri  --  manding them by making them buy them one  --  I said , " Boys and Girls , I do n't want to butt in , but will you have one on me ? " Well , that 's Our native introduction . ' Course in England  --  that is before depression  --  you couldent meet an Englishman that way . You had to have a letter of introduction verified by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate . But with my own Countrymen , when I deco  --  rated the mahogany with a five-dollar Canadian bill and announced that " it was theirs as far as it would travel , " why , I had an entr  --  e into the hearts of my Countrymen that was better than a letter from Bishop Cannon . So we hadent got out of the Van  --  couver Harbor till everybody was slap  --  ping each other on the back and com  --  plimenting the other fellow on having each other 's company for the next eleven days  --  weather permitting . As I got deeper into the crowd at the Beverage Fountain , who do you think I found ? Well , if it wasent the noted Radio Entertainer and Champion War Correspondent of all , Floyd Gibbons . You all remember Floyd . He did that fine bit of radio work of announcing all that had happened in the news . He delivered more words to the minute than anyone ever did . Senators have delivered more words in a day or a week than anyone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators took it away from him on pure endurance . Of course his three minutes still holds a record for WHAT he said , compared to WHAT they said in the week . Then , of course , Floyd covered an awful lot of wars , and a lot of awful wars too . It has practically got so that if Floyd is not at a war that war is not legal , and they have to fight it over . I sure was glad to see him , ' cause he knows his way around . He can speak pretty near everything . Had been in New York the last three years and , naturally , picked up Russian . He has read everything , so when I would start some argument that I dident know anything about , I would slip him the , / "  - -   - -   ' ' ' ' ' % ? . ? ) .. sign and he would come and pick it up for me , and as a team We did pretty good . I would think of some fool thing , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , is going over to the war ; I , of course , am going to attend the Peace Conference . I noticed all the wars of the last few years have had more fighting at the Conferences than they have at the original , so I do n't try to make the original any more . It 's kinder like Hollywood weddings . I get a bundle of Invitations every day to attend the weddings , but I would always rather wait a few weeks and take in the Divorce . Weddings are always the same , but no two Divorces are alike . So , if the war is over when we get over there , Floyd will have ' em put it on again , and I will just sit around and drink some tea with the Geisha Girls till the Peace Conference . Well , we are about to get . to Victoria , where I have to have this letter to mail . Will have to put a stamp on it too  --  not like you . I ca n't help increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the Farmers any Subsidy , but you Boys managed to get yourselvs quite a few little rake-offs . Well , we are pulling into little London . Here , Senator ; I hope you appreciate what I am doing for you on this trip . It 's long , and it 's hazardous , and it 's in  --  convenient , but you want the facts , and that 's what I am going after for you . So , so long ; you wo n't get another letter from me till I get clear over and it comes hack . We ca n't spend the Government 's money with a lot of junk by cable tolls , like the Diplomats can . They keep us broke cabling back what they found out , but do n't tell us why they found it out . Well , here is Victoria , and the Eng  --  lish Customs are coming aboard . Re  --  member , while I am watching this war , you keep its out . of one over borne . Watch Stimpson and do n't let him issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sit there with that big , heavy Gavel and crack those Soft-Shelled Pecans that be raises that I broke three teeth on down at his home a couple of weeks ago . Now , you Progressives , remember now ; do n't do anything till you size up the offer from both sides thoroughly . You fellows never was in better shape than you are this year . No Dog in a Manger was ever laying prettier . Well , so long , Boss . Mail me some Reviews of the opening of Congress ; I want to see how the Show got over this year . You got more Comedy than you ever had in it before , but I do n't know if the Story and Cast will hold up . Well , anyhow , the Government has spent enough money on it ; if it flops , why , of course , it 's Mr. Hoover 's fault , as usual . Well , again , so long . Keep ' em guessing as usual , Boss . Yours . WILL . P. S. : A Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English .
