( See front cover ) One year ago next week a young man in a white suit stepped out into a corridor of Louisiana 's Capitol at Baton Rouge and changed the course of U. S. history by pumping a fatal bullet into Huey P. <P> Long . Since then the closest approach to the earthy , colorful antics and harangues of a Roosevelt-hating Democrat with which Louisiana 's Senator used to pack the galleries and make national headlines have been the juvenilities of West Virginia 's Rush D. Holt . Next week-one day before the anniversary of Long 's death-Georgians will have a chance to supply the nation with a Senate successor who comes considerably closer to matching the talents and temperament of the late Kingfish . To oust Senator Richard Brevard Russell Jr. , 38 , from his comfortable seat in the Democratic primary ( as good as election ) is the supreme purpose of Governor Eugene ( " Our Gene " ) Talmadge , 51 , and a large but indefinite number of Georgians . <P> " Huey Long , " says Gene Talmadge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He and I were mighty good friends . " That Georgia Governor and Louisiana Senator had made a deal " to stop Roosevelt " before Long 's death , Talmadge admits . The extent and degree to which Gene Talmadge possesses Huey Long 's talents is a subject for observers to debate and time to determine . But certain it is that the Governor of Georgia hates the New Deal as bitterly as the one-time Governor of Louisiana ever did . <P> That , plus the facts that he is spectacular , has a national reputation and can rouse a rabble along with the best of them , made next week 's election of solemn interest both to the New Deal and the nation . <P> By last week Georgians were agreed that the Talmadge-Russell contest had turned into their hottest political fight since Joe Brown and Hoke Smith chased each other over the red clay hills 32 years ago . <P> Up &; down the State , by radio and at big , riproaring rallies and barbecues the candidates have poured abuse on each other , whipped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement . Farmers wearing red suspenders , the Talmadge trademark , turned out by hundreds for the Governor 's barbecues of free pork , lamb , beef , chicken and " corn likker . " Aside from the major matter of personalities , the chief issue was the New Deal , of which young Senator Russell is a stanch supporter . <P> Tall , thin Candidate Russell harped on the 396,000,000 Federal dollars which have rolled into Georgia , assailed his opponent as a dictator who ruled the State by militia , described him as a pawn of Yankee capitalists plotting to break up the Democratic Party . Russell played for all it was worth the revelation before the Senate lobby investigating committee that John J. Raskob and Pierre S. du Pont had paid $5,000 each to finance Governor Talmadge 's convention of anti-Roosevelt " Goober Democrats " at Macon last winter ( TIME , April 27 ) . " Sure , I helped raise the taxes , " cried the tax-raising Senator . " We raised ' em on Gene 's friends , the Raskobs and the du Fonts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
