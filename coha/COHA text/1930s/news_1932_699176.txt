txt missing the first large area of asphalt roadway was constructed , in Paris . While showing that the ancients had their asphalt roads , Mr. Stanton declares that the chemist and the concrete technologist are improving on them . He sums up the work being done in the research and materials department of the State : " New cements are being developed which evolve less heat in setting and consequent lessened volumetric changes without material sacrifice in early strengths . Other cements develop a high early strength . Formulas have been worked out for designed concrete mixtures which will result An the densest concrete obtainable with a given amount of cement , and methods of manufacturing and compacting concrete masses have been developed to the extent where it is possible to manufacture concrete ' which will develop strength several times the average strengths of a few years ago . " It is doubtful if Nabopolassar , King of Babylon , went into the matter that deeply .
