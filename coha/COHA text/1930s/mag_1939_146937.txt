THOREAU - Henry Seidel Canby - HoUghton Mifffin ( $3.75 ) . <P> Emerson was proud of his prickly protg Thoreau , called him " As free and erect a mind as any I have ever met . ' Just the same , two years of Thoreau as handyman around the place was more than enough for Emerson . Said witty Elizabeth Hoar : " I love Henry but do not like him , " and Emerson , who knew how she felt , often quoted her wisecrack . Even closer to Henry was his crony , Poet Ellery Channing , who wrote the first Thoreau biography . Channing once confessed : " I have never been able to understand what he meant by his life . " <P> What Thoreau really meant by his life was even less clear to succeeding generations , began to clarify at last under the triumph of industrialism , the rise of dictatorships . In the 1930s this " friend of woodchucks and enemy of the State emerges as the most read and most readable U. S. writer of his time . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , is timely rather than definitive . Canby unearths scant new material , finds no satisfactory answers to such speculations as : Was Henry in love with Emerson 's wife ? Was it Margaret Fuller , the Transcendentalist , to whom he sent his famous " hollow shot " No to a marriage proposal ? The fact is that Thoreau 's own writings contain just about all there is on Thoreau . <P> Transcendentalists complained that he was too practical ( " Strictly speaking , " said Henry , " morality is not healthy " ) . Religious folk called him an infidel ( " One world at a time , " said Thoreau when a friend came to his death bed to talk about the next world ) . " Practical men " called him a dreamer and escapist , were annoyed at his criticism of their pioneering ( " a filibustering toward heaven by the great western route " ) . Poets thought him too science-minded , his language too earthy . Conservatives thought his Civil Disobedience revolutionary ( " I do not care to trace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man or a musket to shoot one with . . . " ) . Radicals and reformers like Alcott thought him anti-social ( " God does not approve of the popular movements , " said Henry , who believed in reforming oneself first ) . The good citizens of Concord simply called him a loafer who had thrown away a Harvard education . <P> Modern readers gauge Thoreau 's genius by the qualities his contemporaries disliked . His eccentricities , prickliness , perversities , were in fact the Yankee thorns that protected him against the embrace of the Transcendentalists , the fashionable gentilities of the Lowells and Longfellows , the transient Utopianisms of the Alcotts , the dated rhetoric of his contemporaries . What moderns can see , what his contemporaries missed , is that Thoreau meant what he said . He was , he declared , a " Realometer , " working his feet " downward through the mud and slush of opinion , and prejudice and tradition , and delusion , and appearance ... to a hard bottom .
