As heavy a corporate name as any in the list of heavy industries is American Radiator &; Standard Sanitary Corp . At the end of last year this $150,000,000 heating &; plumbing company was operating at 88% of normal ( 1926 ) . A $20,000,000 annual profit in 1929 had turned to a string of deficits . Last week , however , in a voice which could certainly be heard as far as Washington . Board Chairman Clarence Mott Woolley roared to a reporter in his great black &; gilt Manhattan headquarters : <P> " We are filled with gratitude to the Government . Men in the building industry carry in their hearts a genuine and profound appreciation . I have always been a rank Republican , but I take my hat off to President Roosevelt ! " <P> What excited this oldtime salesman , who got his start lugging a sample 50-lb. radiator section around the Midwest , was the first upturn in his business in six years . And Mr. Woolley credited it entirely to the Federal Housing Act which provided , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2,000 ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . <P> In the first two months of the Federal Housing Administration 's drive American Radiator business had jumped 40% ahead of the same months of 1933 , said Mr. Woolley . In the first two weeks of October sales were up 75% . " And remember . " said he . " that only the home repair loan section of the Act is effective as yet . When Title II , providing for financing of new homes and apartments , goes into effect in November , the building trades will get another sharp step forward . ' ' <P> Even F. W. Dodge 's building figures , which do not include all of the small repair work which FHA is promoting , showed a clean 100% gain for alterations and additions in the first nine months of 1934 . FHAdministrator James Andrew Moffett 's desk was high-piled with such messages as : ' ' Sacramento reports 1,000 increased employment in the building trades this month over last . Material dealers extremely busy and painters not to be had . ' ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sears Roebuck , were all cashing in on the great drive for home renovation . <P> The actual figures were not impressive . Mr. Moffett estimated that $50,000,000 worth of work had been launched . The important thing was that the drive was snowballing month by month , week by week , day by day . <P> <P> * Last week Mr. Moffett 's estranged wife , Adelaide , died in Manhattan ( see p. 62 )
