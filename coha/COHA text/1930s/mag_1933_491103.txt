F1 PERT PERT advice is the basis of sue- cesful investing . This is partly my own thought , and partly the thought of many successful investors who permit themselves to be interviewed by the better class of financial journals printed on spongy paper smelling faintly of wet slippery elm . Every successful investor speaks carelessly of expert advice , as though it was a reliable and easily obtained commodity , like three-cent stamps or ham and eggs ; but where successful investors fail most miserably , it seems to me , is in telling other investors  --  particularly incipient ones  --  how to recognize expert advice when they encounter it . As a matter of unvarnished fact , the task of locating proper expert investment advice is more difficult than locating high-grade investments ; while the task of persuading an investor  --  particularly a small one  --  to take the proper advice is even more difficult . That . at all events , has been my experience . It has also been my experience that there is only one sure way to keep a small investor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to follow him around with a gun and shoot him as soon as he prepares to make an investment . Many a Little Makes Economic Independence F OR more than twenty years , now , I have been a small investor , eagerly accepting investment advice from friends , from acquaintances , from financial books , magazines and newspapers , and from investment services to which I have contributed in order to receive confidential financial information of the utmost importance . Frequently I have had excellent advice , and occasionally I have tried to follow it . Occasionally , too , I have been prevented from following it by circumstances beyond my control . By and large , my intentions have been excellent , but the advice has not been , as the saying goes , so hot . At times  --  usually at the most critical times  --  it has not even been as warm as an iced halibut . The upshot of my years of small investing is that I am a smaller investor at the present time than I was twenty years ago , whereas , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should by now be a person of considerable prominence in the financial world . I should , in short , be considered competent to advise young men to save , even though incapable of convincing them how their savings should be invested . From my earliest days of investing , I have gone through the motions of saving with the careful regularity of a young Carnegie . In the year 1911 , when I embarked on the sunny blue sea of matrimony , I was receiving the welcome weekly stipend of thirty-five dollars from a newspaper whose offices were located within a stone 's throw of the financial district of Boston , a city whose conservative population has always been able to accumulate a surprisingly large amount of money to invest in copper mines , tottering railroads and the schemes of such financial wizards as Charles Ponzi and Ivar Kreuger . It was only natural , therefore , that my thoughts should dwell on the benefits to be derived from persistent saving and from the judicious investment of those savings . In the beginning my horizon was not wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent interest . My first coherent thoughts on the subject of saving and investing , as I now recall them , were that if we could save five dollars a week our yearly savings would be 5260 , and that the interest on this . at 4 per cent , would be more than ten dollars  --  almost a dollar a month . Since my imagination , in those days , worked freely within certain prescribed limits , I was able to see that , if we were able to save at that rate , our interest in another four years would be a dollar a week . If we permitted the interest to compound , I knew , our capital would double itself every ten years or so ; and knowing this , I had no hesitation in saying that if we persisted in our five-dollar-aweek savings , our savings would , at no distant date , become so plethoric that the income would actually be one dollar a day , or 8365 a year . It was possible , I argued , for two people to exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , when we had saved five dollars a week for fifteen years , it might be quite within the bounds of possibility for us to retire from the arduous labors and uncertain hours of newspaper work and devote ourselves to the writing of important literature , using the dollar-a-day income as a backlog . I can not at the moment remember the location of the European resort where two Americans were supposed to be able to live for a dollar a day ; but since there is no such place , my forgetfulness is of no account . The Sauing Grace I MENTION my mental processes in these matters because I had recently graduated from a university of excellent standing , where I had dabbled in political economy with what seemed to be marked success . I was , in a word , educated ; for I had an A.B . degree to prove it ; and 1 have reason to think that I was about as well educated as the majority of young men who have recently emerged from the sheltering arms of their Alma Meters . The extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my illusions in regard to financial affairs , literature and retirement . The only really sound thing about my views at this early date was the belief that we could save five dollars a week . This we did with complete success for a year and eight months , though I feel free to say that it was something of a strain . At the end of that time my weekly stipend was increased to the unexpected total of forty dollars a week . We promptly added three dollars a week to our savings , and tucked away eight dollars a week for the next eleven months . At the end of that time I caught , for the first time , the faint , elusive fragrance of big money . It seems that all newspapermen , in those days , spoke with bated breaths of a certain Mr. S. S. Carvalho , whose duty it was to keep a finger on the pulse of the newspapers of Mr. W. R. Hearst . I was considerably surprised , one day , to receive a mysterious message from a Boston editor asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of holding a few moments ' conversation with Mr. S. S. Carvalho . This I did , with a feeling of pleasurable excitement . Mr. C'arvalho proved to be an astute-looking gentleman with a small , pointed beard and a pronoun6ed limp , and his reason for wishing to talk to me was not so flattering as I had anticipated . In the back of my brain had been the vague hope that he might wish to commission me to write the great American novel , but instead of that he was looking for somebody to write the dialogue  --  or , technically speaking , the balloons  --  for the comic feature known as the Katzenjammer Kids . I suspect that Mr. Carvalho had frui tlesslyapproach ed other newspapermen  --  probably a great many others  --  on the same errand , and wished to have the matter settled with no loss of time ; for when I told him that I doubted my ability to evolve this sort of literature , he insisted that I make the attempt . Being of an obliging nature , I therefore went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cries of " Awk ! " and " Eek ! " And as a result I received a check for $100 , and the offer of an office of my own in New York , together with a salary of $5000 a year . Opportunity Knocks T HANKS to my university training in economics , I was able to convince myself that although it was comparatively easy to save eight dollars a week in Boston out of a $2000 salary , I could not possibly do it in New York on a $5000 salary , so I refused the $5000 . The $100 , however , I accepted , almost stunned by the ease with which it had been made ; and when it was hustled to the savings bank and added to the money which we had already saved , we had what seemed , to us , to be almost enough to retire on . Inflamed by this sudden windfall , I fear that I bragged publicly about my tremendous earning power . In no other way can I account . for the fact that just at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or so it seemed at the moment . The opportunity arose through an alumnus of the same educational institution I had attended  --  a circumstance that seemed , to a keen reporter like myself , an infallible indication that I was not only being let in on the ground floor but was even being given floor space in the subcellar . What had happened , I gathered , was that the president of a large and successful manufacturing concern had been a trifle pressed for money . He had , therefore , placed his personal holdings of company stock in the hands of my brother alumnus , so that it could be sold privily to a few worthy persons like myself . The president himself had assured my brother alumnus that although the stock had not yet . paid dividends , it was about to pay 1 per cent a month , starting on the following month . It might , my brother alumnus assured me , pay even more . It might , he intimated , be one of those stocks like Ford Motors or Eastman Kodak . five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous fortunes for those who acquired them in the early days of the companies . In spite of all this  --  in spite of the tremendous dividends that the company was on the verge of paying . and in spite of the great fortune the stock might make for the astute purchaser  --  the big-hearted president had expressly stipulated to my brother alumnus that the stock should not be sold for a penny more than $100 a share . That , therefore , was the price we made haste to pay ? $100 a share . I saw no reason why we should not pay that amount . Was I not being advised by a brother alumnus , who had been a prominent athlete ? True , he was selling the stock . but he assured me also that lie was buying some for his own account and risk , What made the stock seem particularly safe was the fact that the president had assured my brother alumnus that he would be glad to buy back the stock at the price paid for it  --  if the buyer was ever sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to look into the company 's earnings . I had only recently been educated , and my education had not included anything so in-collegiate and mercenary as where to go and what to do in order to check up on an investment  --  or even how to make one . It never occurred to me to find out what other stocks could be purchased at $100 a share in the open market , and how much they paid , and what labored so carefully to save , this was about 100 per cent better than we were entitled to receive . I might also add that it was about 100 per cent more than most small investors get back from their original investments . The New England Complex AL PHOUGH we were certain , as soon as we made this investment , that it would , with little further effort . on our part , make us independently wealthy , we were still actuated by what might be called the Russell Sage or New England vomplex , and so could not , at such short notice , discontinue our habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided by two discoveries . One was the discovery that friends who dropped in on us for a quiet game of poker were not averse , on winning a jack pot. , to contributing an infinitesimal portion of their winnings to a small tin bank bearing the words Travel Fund . It was understood , vaguely , that the money contributed to this fund would eventually be utilized to carry us to the foreign strand where we were to live for one dollar a day while engaged in writing the great American novel . What we ultimately bought with the travel fund was a St .. Louis-San Francisco , prior lien , with the hook but the characters ' names . And then we throw out the title . Sure !

( Corniinti.d on Page 64 ) ( Continued from Page 621 We were horrified at . the idea . American This-and-That , we told him , was going to pay twelve dollars a year , and probably more , so why should we consider a stock that only yielded half of that. , to say nothing of a bond whose yield would be practically infinitesimal ? Mr. Harlow then pointed out something which we had entirely overlooked  --  that wo might sometime need the money which we had invested . If it was invested in an unlisted security , he said , we might . have trouble getting it , because unlisted securities frequently can not be sold without considerable delay . To show Mr. Harlow how wrong he was in our particular case , I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American This-and-That . The answer stated that it was quoted at . 21 asked , nothing bid . Treasurer 's Report I then decided that Mr. Harlow 's advice had not been so had as I had at first . supposed , so I wrote a letter to the president . of the American This-andThat Company , reminding him of the offer made in his behalf by the brother alumnus who had sold us the stock , and suggesting that our stock be purchased from us at MO . In the course of time the treasurer of the company replied . stating that the president . had gone to i Europe for his health , and expressing the belief , in pained language , that I was proposing a transaction that might , in many circles , lie regarded as unethical and almost illegal . Just why it might have been regarded in this way I never learned , but the treasurer 's letter frightened us into a state of silence and inaction , where American This-and-That was concerned , that lasted for sixteen years . It was at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped to handle our own investment program without advice ; and because of this suspicion 1 decided to take advantage , in the future , of Mr. Harlow 's suggestions . When I broke this news to him , however , I found myself obliged to disagree with his persistent belief that we should invest in bonds . I pointed out that bonds usually cost . about $10110 apiece , and that we never had $1000 to invest at any one time ; whereupon he countered by saying that we needed to make only a part payment in the beginning . Then I protested that bonds did not so easily increase in value as did a good stock . He said that . this might sometimes be true , but neither did they decrease so easily . In fact , he had an answer to everything ; and finally , in desperation , I was obliged to put down my foot firmly and say that we did n't want bonds , and only wished to buy good stocks that would go up and up . He therefore advised General Electric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open market , I find , was one share of General Electric at To us , this proved enormously interesting and exciting ; for our one share rose almost at once . We watched it closely from day to day , stud when it had risen ten points we consulted Mr. Harlow about , selling . To our surprise , he advised against it . One share of stock , ho patiently explained , was not a sufficiently large holding to embarrass us in case of a decline ; and if we were satisfied with the dividend which it paid us , we-ought to disregard its market price and look at it as a fairly permanent investment . To us , this argument did not seem sound . We were attempting to accumulate an estate that would permit us to devote all our efforts to literature ; and as we saw it , the way to add to an estate was to add to it , even though the addition was only ten dollars . Our ventures into finance , though small , had already acquainted us with the celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit . " When we reminded Mr. Har- ? low of these things he said that he did . not wish to interfere with our principles , and if we felt we must sell , there was nothing to do but sell . We therefore sold , and took our ten-point profit . We then consulted Mr. Harlow about investing the proceeds , and to our distress he advised putting it bark into General Electric , which had meanwhile risen a few more points . We protested that we could n't , as we had just sold it . Mr. Harlow assured us that our sale had not affected the value of General Electric as an investment , and that it was as good as when we first bought it . Here again we were visited by a faint premonition that we had made a mistake . Nevertheless we steadfastly refused to buy hack General Electric at a higher price , and before long our faint premonition became a certainty ; for General Electric split its shares and declared extra dividends and disbursed stork in subsidiary companies with such enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained it , would have done even better for us than all our American This-and-That stock would have done if it had lived up to what it was expected to do . This early experience had a certain value , however . It taught us never to sell an Mvestment which seemed to be good . For the next fifteen years , thanks to our experience with General Electric , we never sold except on expert . advice . Consequently we usually sold things we should have held forever , and carefully held the things we should have vigorously kicked overboard at the earliest opportunity . Fragmentary Buying When Mr. Harlow found us adamant about General Electric , he once snore suggested hopefully that we buy a bond . Finding that we would not , he reluctantly advised several preferred stocks and one or two common stocks , including that sterling New England stand-by , American Telephone . The next year and a half , therefore , saw us carefully diversifying our holdings and dropping our savings into what are known , in financial circles , as good business men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we purchased four American Agricultural Chemical preferred , three United Shoe Machinery preferred , three American Telephone , two Southern Pacific. , five Western Union , live United States Smelting preferred , two Swift &; Co. , and a few scattered shares of American Smelting preferred , Adirondack Electric Power preferred , Great Northern preferred , Northern Texas Electric preferred , ' Westinghouse , United Cigar Stores and American Agricultural Chemical common . In the purchasing of these fragments we had necessarily come in contact with a large number of young men whose business hours were devoted to finance . It is true that a great many of them seemed to do little but stand at dusty windows and peer down at the traffic in Stato Street , but I assume  --  or assumed at the time  --  that most of them were thinking about financial matters . Therefore I had great respect for their financial judgment , and often wished that I had their vast knowledge , so that I could select one or two really good stocks and invest heavily in them , rather than putter about with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as I knew at that time , one financial expert was as good as another . Why I should have thought so I can not tell , unless there is something in the atmosphere of North America that causes all amateur investors to make the same mistake . Some of the young men were specialists on certain stocks  --  or so it was said  --  and apparently they had ways and means of knowing what the stocks in which they specialized were going to do . It was during Mr , Harlow 's absence on a business trip that I overheard a discussion of copper stocks by a group of these experts . Nearly all Boston financial experts , it seems , have specialized in copper stocks at one time or another , and at such times nearly all of Boston . including the experts , had been severely singed . I was not , however , aware of this fact . All I knew was that a group of financial experts was discussing copper stocks , and that the trend of their discourse was that copper stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were OIL the verge of making untold profits and paying dividends that would make the national debt of Great Britain look Like something out of a child 's bank . If what they said was true , one could afford to buy an indefinite number of shares without spending a cent , since the dividends were already so high that they would , in time , pay for the shares . Utah Copper , for example , paid something like 12 per cent . Soon it was expected to pay 16 , if not 20. 1 , therefore . gathered that the thing to do was to let a broker buy the Utah stock and carry it . For carrying it . he would charge 6 per cent of the value of the stock . If the stock , however , paid 16 per cent , 6 per cent would go to the broker , whereas 10 per cent would go to the account of the purchaser . and in ten years Utah Copper would have paid for itself . .8 Flyer in Copper As a result of what I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire our few odd-lot investments , and had thereby received the title of " our broker . " Was it true , I asked him , that Utah and Anaconda were the best copper stocks , and were they good investments , and was it a fact that their dividends would pay for them in ten years ' time , and ought add stock in them to our investments ? " Our broker " said that they were considered to be among the best of the coppers , and that they were making a lot of money , which resulted in extremely high dividends , and that if they continued to disburse any such dividends they would certainly pay for themselves in ten years or so . As for investing in them , he said , a few copper shares probably would n't do me any harm . I assume that his answer was based on the knowledge that my high-water purchases , theretofore , had been a block of four Am . Ag . Chem. preferred . His answer was thoroughly satisfactory to me , and I at once ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My broker " was silent for a moment , and then said , " Well , you do n't have to buy so many , do you ? " I said that if they were really going to pay such large dividends , I might as well have fifty shares as five shares . " Our broker " said , yes , but what if they should stop paying such high dividends ? I asked whether anyone expected them to pay smaller dividends , and he said , no , nobody ever expected copper stocks to reduce their dividends , but somehow they always did . On this , I told him what I had beard the copper specialists say  --  that in their opinion the copper stocks were in for a period of great prosperity . Probably " our broker " had other things to do that day , for my argument silenced him ; and on the following morning we received a statement showing that twenty-five shares of Utah Copper and fifty shares of Anaconda Copper had been purchased for our account and risk , the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may as well say at once that . they went up about ten points . We had , however , learned our lesson from our one share of General Electric . We held on , and in a week or two they went down . In a month or two , their dividends were cut . Before long , they were cut almost to the vanishing point . Reading the Riot Act To make a long story short , it took us six years to pay for our Utah and Anaconda . Nine years after we had first purchased them , we got our money hack , but only after suffering a series of severe mental strains and shifting in and out of other stocks on the advice of a series of experts . By that time , unfortunately , we had reached the real-estate phase of our investment . experiences , so that the phrase " got our money back " is slightly misleading . In theory we got it . balls , but actually we didn't. , as will he made clear when 1 arrive at the real-estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Harlow returned to Boston ; and from the cold gaze he turned on me when I encountered him again , I knew he had learned from " our broker " of our latest investments . He said nothing , however , until the time arrived when the only investment 1 seemed to he in a position to make was in olive-drab uniforms  --  one of whipcord for best , and one , issue , for rough work . He then backed me into a quiet corner and , in the kindest possible manner , told me his thoughts . I might remark in passing that advisers who are competent to give advice are far too kindly in their mariner . Unfortunately , there is nothing that . can be done about it ; for if a competent adviser is as brutal toward an investor as he should be , the recipient of the advice may become indignant and go to an incompetent or a dishonest adviser , who will soothe his ruffled spirits and give him the worst possible advice .

The thing to do , as I see it. , is to turn all your securities over to the Steenth National Bank as collateral , and have the bank buy a block of Liberty bonds for you  --  a block so big that you 'll be paying for them for some time to come . The bank can hold your stocks and the bonds , too , and so wo n't run any risk at all .

" I am happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suggestion , and went at once with hint to the Steenth National Bank , where we were Tirumptly admitted to Mr. Swenson 's office . Mr. Swenson nodded imperturbably when Mr. Harlow introduced me and explained our presence ; and while Mr. Harlow ran over the situation , Mr. SWPflh011 stared gloomily at his desk and fingered a paper cutter . Mr. Harlow explained that I was industrious , having taken nu day alt in two years , and saving  --  as was proved by the amount I had invested during that time . He mentioned my desire to transfer my holdings to Liberty bonds , and the loyern ment 's desire to sell these bonds , as well as the benefit that such is transfer might some day prove to be , both to the bank and to me . When he had outlined iris scheme of transfer , he asked Mr. Swenson 's collaboration in my behalf , Mr. Swenson stared even harder at his desk and shook his head sadly . " Mr Harlow , " be said , " this bank is nut in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to buy I " Mr. Harlow protested . " I 'd hardly call that speculating ! " " We could n't consider it , " Mr. Swenson sighed . " It would be speculating . " He made it quite clear that there was nothing to be said on the subject ; so , feeling very uncomfortable . Mr. Harlow and I came away . Mr. Harlow apologized for having taken me to the hank , but I was unable to see then , nor am I able to see now , why he should have apologized . Occasionally , as I said in the beginning , an investor is prevented by circumstances beyond his control from following good advice . At all events , our investments remained as theywere , unadorned by any Liberty bonds , barring a few small ones . I soon went into the Army and . to my deep sorrow , never saw Mr. Harlow again . Because of my association with him , however , I had become conscious of certain fundamentals of value to the small investor , to wit : Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ca n't be learned in fifteen minutes by any person able to read the ? ompany 's yearly report . The yearly reports of all companies may be seen in any bank or brokerage offiee. ' 2 . The affairs of many stock companies are beyond the understanding of their own officials , and are , therefore , even darker secrets to all outsiders , including stock-market experts . 3 . It . is only by the hardest of work that a small investor saves money . Having worked hard to save it , a person should he willing and able to work equally hard to invest it safely , and to watch his investments constantly . If his is either unwilling or unable to do so lie will , if he lives long enough , go wrung on all investments with one exception  --  it Government bond whose principal and interest are payable in gold . Any person wise gives advice contrary to this is as had adviser . When the war was over , 1 had an excellent opportunity to apply these fundamentals to my own conduct ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bonds and real estate I shall con- scientiously confess  --  no matter how notch it hurts ,
