When 25 of the nation 's top-notch contract bridge teams sat down in Manhattan 's Shelton Hotel last week to fight for the most prized team-of-four trophy in their sport , the Vanderbilt Cup , favorites to win were the famed Four Aces and a team led by Yachtsman Harold Stirling Vanderbilt , the cup donor . The Four Aces had won this annual event four times ; Vanderbilt 's team had won once , been runner-up to the Aces twice . Ace Oswald Jacoby was so confident that in the first round he bet $100 to $10 against his opponents , a team that had barely qualified , was soundly beaten for his overconfidence . So Yachtsman Vanderbilt seemed to have clear sailing . <P> Near the end of the semifinal round occurred an incident characteristic of tournament bridge , which is played with fierce attention to technicalities like a small boys ' baseball game . In a nip- &-tuck; match , A. Mitchell Barnes of the Vanderbilt team , playing a five-heart doubled contract , led a heart from dummy , pondered whether to finesse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPherran said : " It makes no difference . " Mr. Barnes thereupon deduced that Mr. McPherran had two hearts instead of three , eventually went down 500 points instead of 300 . Mr. Barnes protested that he had been misled , got a referee to award him 200 points . His team finished the match 120 points ahead . Thereupon began a series of protests and counterprotests that rocked the tournament and culminated next day in a conference of five of contract 's highest authorities to decide the dispute . After an hour-and-a-half session , during which it was established that Mr. McPherran had erred in speaking but Mr. Barnes had no business believing him , the committee voted three-to-two in Mr. McPherran 's favor . Exhausted by its emotional ordeal , Mr. McPherran 's team was defeated in the final round by a team captained by fat , easygoing , oldtime Expert Harry B. Raffel.
