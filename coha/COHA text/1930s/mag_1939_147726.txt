A still-smarting convalescent from the occupational disease of British Prime Ministers was Britain 's Prime Minister last week . Hobbling gingerly after his first bout of gout ( podagra ) in 18 months , Neville Chamberlain presided over a Cabinet meeting , his left foot swathed in an enormous flannel boot . Outside , London was whistling the newest hit tune : God Bless You , Mr. Chamberlain . What consolation he could the Prime Minister took from echoes of this ditty and from the list of his distinguished gouty predecessors : Derby , Disraeli , Palmerston , Melbourne , Canning , the Pitts. - Several of these statesmen courted gout by stuffing themselves with mutton chops and port . But hard-working Neville Chamberlain is no high liver . Said his sympathetic friends : his trouble was " poor man 's gout , " a hereditary chronic disease ( his father , Joseph Chamberlain , had it ) which may torment even teetotalers . <P> Chief cause of gout is imperfect elimination of uric acid , and attacks may be caused by heavy consumption of rich food , malt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gout is hereditary , overindulgence usually aggravates the underlying weakness . Rare in the whiskey-drinking U. S. , gout is most common in aley Britain and beery Germany . <P> Uric acid retained in the bloodstream is likely to form chalky , stony deposits in the joints and in the cartilage of the ears . Frequently first to suffer is the joint of the big toe , then ankles , knees , hands and wrists . Common symptoms : cramps , inflammation , fever , headache , neuralgia , together with hot , itching feet ( known to ancients as " the lisping of the gout " ) . <P> " Once gouty always gouty " is an old medical maxim , yet doctors believe that clean living and plenty of outdoor exercise can reduce attacks to mere demonstrations in force . Standard treatment , besides wrapping the throbbing foot in cotton wool , is a diet with plenty of water , and strangely enough , fat , especially fresh butter . Many doctors also rely on injections of colchicine ( from the root of the autumn crocus ) to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid ) to promote uric acid elimination . <P> Even doctors , some of whom have been " terrible sufferers , " find it hard to speak of gout with a straight face . Some , like their patients , pride themselves on their virile infirmity . Osier quotes approvingly Germany 's Willibald Pirkheimer ( translated into English in 1617 ) : " I take no pleasure , " he wrote , " in those hard , rough , rusticke , agresticke kind of people who are never at rest , but ... are moyling and toyling , do seldom or never give themselves to pleasure , do endure hunger , which are content with a slender diet . " <P> * " The elder Pitt 's attacks of gout , " said the Italian paper Telegrafo last week , " were the most splendid and memorable in British history . They are definitely linked with the conquest of Canada and India . In British statesmen gout acts as an imperialist stimulant . Beware if Mr.Chamberlain returns to the House of Commons . . . hobbling on crutches. "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
