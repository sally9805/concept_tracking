txt Postmaster General Walter G. Brown threw President Hoover 's hat into the ring today for another four-year term in the White House . Mr. Brown , who is generally re1 garded as likely to succeed Senator Fess as Republican National Chairman , had a long conference with the President , presumably on political matters , as he is the President 's chief political adviser . " I am not making any formal announcement on behalf of the Presldent , " said Mr. Brown after the conference , " but to those who have inquired of me whether or not the 1President would be a candidate for re-election I have replied that of course he was a candidate . The friends of the President feel that he ought to be renominated and they will take the proper steps to look after his candidacy in various States . " Statement Accepted as Official . Mr. Brown 's statement was accepted here as the answer of Mr. Hoover and his supporters to suggestions from various groups of regular Republicans that the President , because of the general economic depression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , should renounce renomination and open the way for the selection of former President Coolidge , General Charles G. Dawes , Senator Hiram Johnson or some other possible candidate looked upon as more likely to win . The supporters of President Hoover age confident that nothing can prevent his renomination by the Chicago convention . Mr. Coolidge , in a recent magazine article , announced that he would support Mr. Hoover and would not countenance any effort to draft him . General Dawes , since the announcement of his resignation as Ambassador to Great Britain , declared emphatically that talk of his candidacy was nonsense . Johnson 's Attitude Uncertain . Senator Johnson seemingly has not decided whether to make a contest against Mr. Hoover . Radical Republicans in the Senate , ' who share the California Senator 's dislike of the President , every day are urging Senator Johnson to run . They have been joined by regular Republicans who do not wish so much the nomination of Senator Johnson as the creation of a situation which might prevent the renomination of the President and the selection of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . Senator Johnson , who has been invited by his colleagues , Senators Gerald P. Nye and Lynn J. Frazier of North Dakota , to enter the preferential primary in that State , has replied to these appeals by saying that he is too busy at present with the investigation of foreign bond sales to give thought to his candidacy . He has indicated that he wilt give a definite answer when this investigation is finished and that his decision will be based upon the public reaction to the disclosures of the investigation . Southern Delegates Hold Hey . The friends of the President are confident that he will go into the convention with the overwhelming majority of the delegates . He will have , to begin with , virtually all the delegates from the South , who are controlled largely by patronage and are believed to have been rounded up . It is this Southern vote in a Republican National Convention , invariably at the disposal of a Republican National Administration , which makes it difficult to deprive a Republican President of renomination , as was demonstrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is California , the home of both President Hoover and Senator Johnson . The loss of his own State would be a serious embarrassment to Mr. Hoover , and Mark Requa , the new national committeeman , a personal friend of the President , has been active in perfecting an organization which , it is believed by the President 's friends , will assure him California 's forty-four delegates . A California Truce in 1928 . In 1928 Senator Johnson 's friends made no fight against Mr. Hoover and in return the Hoover supporters did not try to prevent the renomination or re-election of Senator Johnson . Senator Johnson undoubtedly will be a candidate for renomination and re-election in 1934 , and one reason for his hesitancy in declaring himself a Presidential candidate is his knowledge that he would face possible reprisals from the President 's friends two years hence . The decision apparently reached by the President and Mr. Brown and his other political advisers is to leave the question of Mr. Hoover 's candidacy in direct primary States to the group of Hoover supporters in each of these States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will be confined to the formal expressions of consent to be a candidate required by the laws of those States . First Primary in New Hampshire . The first primary will be held in New Hampshire on March 8 and Senator George H. Moses already has filed for election as delegate , pledged to the nominatio:i of President Hoover . The North Dakota Twimary , scheduled for March 15 , is the first State to hold a primary in which a contest is probable . Mr. Hoover will not enter the North Dakota primary unless the Hoover committee in that State should file his name , and the committee will not file the President 's name , according to information here , unless Senator Johnson or some other candidate regarded as a real contender should file . The present intention , as far as could be learned , is for the President 's friends in North Dakota to ignore the candidacy of former Senator Joseph I. France of Maryland , who has filed as a Republican Presidential candidate in North Dakota , and to seek an uninstructed delegation . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on April 5 ; Illinois , on April 12 ; Nebraska , on April 12 ; Pennsylvania , on April ' 26 ; Massachusetts , on April 26 ; Maryland , on May 2 ; California , on May 3 ; Ohio , on May 10 ; West Virginia , on May 10 ; New Jersey , on . May 17 , and Oregon , on May 20 . On April 15 , New York will elect Congressional district delegates only . To enter the Ohio primaries , for example , the President must file notice of intention to be a candidate sixty days before the primary election , which would be March 10 . The President 's supporters intend to enter , him in the preferential primary in that State , for which his consent is required . The President 's political advisers so far have received no word of any rising against Mr. Hoover in New England , New York and other important States which would threaten his renomination. ? -                  @ @ @
