THE STRANGE NOISE OF DR . BELDOON A STORY BY MORRIS MARKEY TT WAS just a little after five o'clock on the afternoon of Friday , April 27th , when Doctor Beldoon heard the noise for the first time . He had permitted Miss Burch to leave early so that she might enjoy a long week-end , and with his appointments for the day behind him , he was going over the account books . Business was not good . But then it could be much worse , as witness the gloomy affairs of several of his colleagues . If only three or four of those old bills were paid up . . . Mr. James Evinrude Peters , for example . One year ago exactly , he had been whimpering for the salvation of his meager body , saying , " Spare no cost , Doctor . Expense means nothing at all . " It had been a good operation too . But with Mr. Peters striding again among his devout employes , those fine words had slipped quite out of his mind . He had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monthly statement . Dr. Beldoon 's thoughts dwelt harshly upon Mr. Peters . Sitting there alone , he began to lose his temper . He got pen and paper and muttered to himself , " I 'm going to tell that robber exactly what I think of him . " He dipped his pen and wrote , " Sir . " And then he heard the noise . It was a low , hissing sound , just behind his right ear . Dr. Beldoon spun sharply round and cried , " What was that ? " The room was empty . He got himself a glass of water and sat down again at hisdesk . He wrote , " Apparently , it is necessary . . . " The noise came again , no louder , no more insistent , but precisely the same as before . This time he did not jump . For some odd reason he had been expecting it . He got slowly to his feet and ran his handkerchief over his face and said , " I 'm getting a little jittery . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until to-morrow . " The next morning , in the absence of Miss Burch , he opened the mail himself . The third letter down contained a check for four hundred dollars , signed James Evinrude Peters . Dr. Beldoon laughed to himself and said , " Lucky coincidence , having that ringing in my ear last night . I should have lost a patient . " He forgot all about it . But before the month was out he had occasion to remember it well enough . For the noise came again . Mrs. Verna Cassidy was in his treatment room . She was an old patient , and a pleasant one , and he had accustomed himself to the humoring of the tendency she showed toward hypochondria . He always listened gravely to her symptoms and generally gave her something harmless in the way of a pill or an elixir . This time it was sore throat  --  the most dreadful sore throat that human ever suffered . He smiled to himself at the fluency of her plaints , even as she protested that she was hardly able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that her throat was indeed rather inflamed , and spoke sympathetic words . " Those tonsils acting up again , " he told her . " I 'll just give you a good gargle and ask you to rest quietly at home for a day or two . " Just behind his right ear there was a low , hissing sound . He glanced quickly at Mrs. Cassidy . " Did you hear anything ? " he asked . She seemed bewildered . " Hear anything ? Of course not . What should I hear ? " " It 's nothing , " he said . " But here  --  perhaps I had better take a culture of that throat after all . " He proceeded with his swabs . The next morning the laboratory informed him that Mrs. Cassidy had diphtheria . It required all of his skill to save her life . He worked over her so intently that he did not have time to think very much about the noise . But when her recovery was assured , and he could relax , the queer nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelt upon it , and he debated the wisdom of confiding in his wife . She was a sensible woman . She might have some perfectly simple explanation . But in the end he decided that there was nothing really except a pair of absurd coincidences , and he would sound foolish if he talked of them . Nevertheless , he went to Dr. Lane and had his ears examined . Dr. Lane was a hearty man . He slapped Dr. Beldoon on the back and roared , " You 're as sound as a two-year-old . Not a thing wrong with those ears , my boy . " Well he had known that . The noise was not , strictly speaking , in his ears at all . It was just behind his right ear , quite outside of his head . For some perverse reason he wanted to hear it again now : to listen carefully and analyze its quality objectively . He heard it . He was operating on a child . It was a simple job . He reached toward the nurse 's hand for an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already made . But before he could do so the low , hissing soundcame , immediately behind his ear . He thrust the instrument back into the nurse 's hand and harshly demanded another one . " That was not sterilized , " he said . The nurse made no answer . There was no way for him to determine , later , whether his suspicions of the instrument were justified . But , beginning with that episode , he placed greater and greater dependence upon the noise . He began to accept its warnings without question . Consequently the noise came much more frequently . In diagnosis and treatment and operations he found himself listening carefully . And when the low , hissing sound spoke to him he immediately checked his course , whatever it might be , and cast about for a new approach . Several times he experimented by deliberately doing something wrong to see whether the sound would come  --  such as prescribing quinine for simple indigestion . But on these occasions nothing happened at all . After the first shock of astonishment , he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , to be blessed with this remarkable insurance against error . He went about in fine humor , and all of his friends spoke to him of his glowing health , his obvious delight with the world . His wife was particularly pleased and joined him in seeking out gay amusements from one end of the city to the other . Once or twice , he thought , she glanced at him with a rather peculiar expression on her face . But the expression passed so quickly that he could not be sure , and he dismissed these incidents as idle fancies . By the end of summer the low , hissing noise was as natural to Dr. Beldoon as the water he drank or the food he ate . And it was this very fact which opened up the final succession of events . On a Thursday night , with the cook out , he and his wife were making up some bizarre concoction at the kitchen stove . ( He was very fond of cooking . ) In following the complex demands of the recipe he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leeks . The warning came , in its usual way , and Dr. Beldoon said lightly , " Much obliged , son . I 'm glad you were looking . " His wife , who was standing directly beside him , caught her breath . " Roy ! " she said . He looked at her , and there was no doubt now of the peculiar expression . " What is it , my dear ? " he asked . She seemed quite upset . " I do n't like to be a killjoy , " she said slowly . " You 've been wonderful lately . But . . . I do n't know how to put it . . . it is n't just exactly like you . You 've been so .. . well , not unnaturally gay , but .. . strange is n't the word either .. . Please , Roy , what 's the matter ? " He was a trifle confused . " Matter ? " he said . " Why , nothing . Nothing at all . Of course I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck with my patients . Have n't lost a life since April . " It was three o'clock in the morning when he sat bolt upright in their darkened bedroom and heard his own words echo loudly in his head . " Lucky with my patients ! " That was it . Luck . Not his own skill . The luck of that damned hissing sound . And what did he know about the hissing sound anyway ? It might be toying with him , building him up for some horrible catastrophe . Getting his complete confidence , just to ruin him  --  to make him murder , yes , actually murder one of his patients . Why , the thing might turn against him any moment ! He did not sleep again that night . Wild and cruel imaginings swept through his mind . He tossed , making up his mind a thousand times over that he would never heed the noise again , no matter what the consequences . He was up early and left the house without seeing his wife . All through a heavy day of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy it . But it did not come . Nor did it come the next day or the next . Then , late on Saturday , one of his oldest and dearest friends was hurt in a dreadful automobile accident . He was called to the hospital where the friend lay , and listened to the friend 's wife , begging for the performance of a miracle . The right leg was severely crushed . If this had been the clinic , he would have amputated without a second thought . But this was Frank , his friend , and it seemed horrible to make of Frank a cripple for the rest of his life . If surgery had great resources , this was the time of all times to call them up . He dismissed the idea of amputation and bent over to put the broken bones back into their proper place . Just behind his right ear there was a low , hissing sound . It was all he could do to keep from crying out in anguish . Clear as a flame before his eyes there gleamed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went furiously to work . But at intervals of perhaps one minute , the noise repeated itself  --  never urgent nor plaintive , but changeless and sure . His nurses did not know how close he had come to a hysterical outburst when , in a low , tight voice , he said , " Prepare to amputate . " . From that day on the life of Dr. Beldoon turned into a dark and bitter dream . The change that came over him was indeed remarkable . His face grew drawn and expressionless , except for the eyes which were eternally darting about . He spoke rarely , even to his wife , and sleep was almost impossible . He lost weight to an alarming extent . Naturally , his wife and his friends tried to talk to him . But there was only frustration to reward them , because he seemed hardly to hear them at all . When he answered , it was to say in a vacant sort of way , " Oh , yes . Yes . You are certainly right . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times had driven him to the use of drugs . But this of course was not true . It was past midnight of November 12-13th that the solution of his difficulties came to him as suddenly and simply as a summer rain . He would destroy the noise . Why , in the name of Heaven , had he not thought of that before ? He almost chuckled at his own stupidity . He knew exactly where the noise was hiding . Immediately behind his right ear . And destroying it would be so ridiculously easy too . He went into his library , moving quietly so that he would not wake his wife , and found his pistol in the drawerwhere it was always kept . He examined its load . Then he listened . There was no noise this time . He laughed quite loudly and cried in a jeering way , " Ha ! You 're quiet this time , are you ? Afraid to let me know where you are , eh ? " A light of triumph , mixed with an intense amusement , was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise was hiding and pulled the trigger . When his wife came rushing into the room a smile of great contentment was on his still lips . LOST WORLD BY HERMANN HAGEDORN ' THREE times through this thicket of thorns , this baffling Tangle of dripping briars , this malign net Of fog and lashing boughs ; over fallen timber And icy ledges , three times , seeking a trail , I have torn , bleeding , my way , and returned whence I came .
