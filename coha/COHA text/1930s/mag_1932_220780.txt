Inside the British Consulate at Shanghai last week , closely guarded by His Majesty 's Marines in full war regalia , sat an aristocratic Old Etonian , Sir Miles Wedderburn Lampson . <P> Years ago he accepted from the Emperor of Japan both the Order of the Rising Sun ( 3rd class ) and the Order of the Sacred Treasure ( 3rd class ) . Since 1926 he has been British Minister to China , and soon after Japan struck at Shanghai ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) handsome , trim-mustached Sir Miles began trying to make peace . On his desk last week lay the makings : an agreement in English ready to be initialed by the plenipotentiaries of China . Japan and the Great Powers providing for Japanese evacuation . Picking up a pen , Sir Miles initialed the agreement first himself , then sent it to the hospitals where three of the Oriental signers lay painfully in beds . <P> A Japanese surgeon had just cut out the right eyeball of Vice Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura . Another surgeon was waiting to cut off the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Korean bomb thrown fortnight ago during a Japanese military and naval review at Shanghai ( TIME , May 9 ) . Propped up in bed and waiting for his leg to be cut at the knee , Minister Shigemitsu smiled with heroic Japanese courtesy at Director of Intelligence Samuel Chang whom the Chinese Government had sent to witness his signature . <P> " Tell your people-tell the Chinese people , " said the ashen-lipped Japanese Minister . " I dearly wish that we shall be at peace ! " <P> Samuel Chang approached the bed , made as though to shake Minister Shigemitsu 's right hand , drew back when he saw it was bandaged . <P> " Here , shake my left hand ! " cried the game little Japanese , and as they shook he patted Samuel Chang 's hand with his bandaged right . At 1:14 p.m . Minister Shigemitsu signed the agreement , lost his leg two hours later , received a blood transfusion , was described by his Japanese surgeon as " in a condition not quite hopeless . " <P> Samuel Chang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chinese Foreign Vice Minister Quo Taichi , not in a glittering Government limousine but in a ramshackle Chinese taxi with its old-fashioned shades tightly drawn . This precaution was necessary because Shanghai citizens instinctively suspected that the Old Etonian and the wounded Japanese were trying to put something over on China . Mere announcement that the agreement was to be signed had sent 100 Chinese students hot-footing it into the French Concession where they burst into the home of prospective Chinese Signer Quo . <P> " Toad-in-the-slime ! " screamed the students . " You have betrayed China ! " <P> Before Mr. Quo could answer a student threw a plate which gashed him just above the eye . Other students pitched in , knocked Mr. Quo down , beat and kicked him , would have killed China 's Signer had not French police arrived . <P> Terms of the Pax Britannica signed at Shanghai : <P> 1 ) The Japanese forces are to withdraw within four weeks from the Woosung Forts and other occupied areas around Shanghai . Japan began this withdrawal promptly last week .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
