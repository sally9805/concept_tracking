1 : EXTERIOR SAN DIEGO FISH WHARF - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY TIGER SHARK Through the Main Title and Credit Titles , the screaming of a gale at sea . In the background -- raging , storm-tossed waves . FADE IN SHOOTING along the wharf toward the calm sunlit waters of the bay . Toward the end of the wharf is a bulletin-board on which a man is writing something in large letters , with a piece of chalk . Two or three men in fishing costumes , are standing watching as he writes . One shakes his head grimly and walks away . Along the wharf is stretched a long bait-net with two or three fishermen , and perhaps one old Portuguese woman , working on it -- repairing holes . One of the men leaves the net for a moment , reads the bulletin-board , and goes back to work thoughtfully . TRUCK IN CAMERA along the wharf . Other fishermen and fish-wives pass the CAMERA , read the bulletin-board and drift along with set faces .

This basket is about five feet high and three feet in diameter . It is one of the baskets used -- as we show later -- in unloading tuna from the boats at the cannery wharf . In the shadowy interior of the shed , we get a suggestion of nets , fishing poles , hausers -- five inches thick -- and other marine and fishing equipment . Under the inverted basket , which is propped up on two small boxes , a man is sitting . On the outside of the basket another man is sitting lashing chain ( for use in unloading fish ) to the outside of the basket , assisted by the man on the inside . &nbsp; MAN ( on outside of basket ) ...

TRUCK CAMERA toward end of wharf where couple of men and a woman are gazing bitterly out to sea . The CAMERA PASSES them and stops at the edge of the wharf , looking across the open bay . LAP DISSOLVE TO : 4 : OCEAN - LONG SHOT DAY A fishing dory is tossing helplessly on the ocean . 5 : MEDIUM SHOT ON THE DORY One of the gunwales is splintered , probably from smashing against the larger boat from which it was launched . Fernandez sits hunched in the bow . He has long , wind-matted hair ; his face is gaunt . He sits staring dully at the bottom of the dory , awaiting death . Stretched on the bottom of the boat toward the stern , lies Pipes Boley , practically unconscious . He has a growth of beard , as have the others . He wears a white shirt and a beret and white duck trousers . These clothes are cleaner than the rough corduroys and the striped shirts of the other men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , they seem to show some semblance of refinement . The one member of the castaways still on his feet is Mike Mascarena , a picturesque Portuguese fishing captain , in bare feet , checkered shirt , sash , gold ear-rings and a sweeping mustache . His face is burned by sun ; his lips swollen and cracked with thirst . He is obviously weakened by the fearful exposure of many days , but his indomitable will keeps him upright , scanning the tossing ocean for a sail that will save their lives . Pipes stirs , and tries to raise himself . 6 : CLOSER SHOT OF PIPES AND MIKE &nbsp; PIPES BOLEY ( with difficulty through cracked lips ) Water ... water .... Mike turns and looks at him . He takes a water can from beneath the seat over which he is standing , apparently as guard . He is handing the can to Pipes when he in interrupted by the voice of Fernandez in the bow . &nbsp; VOICE OF FERNANDEZGive me some of that . &nbsp; MIKE MASCARENA ( snarling ) Go too deveel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask and straightens up . As he does so , a huge shark-fin cuts close to the edge of the boat . Mike sees it . He picks up the stump of an oar broken off by the exertion of rowing , and throws it at the shark . 7 : CLOSE UP SURFACE OF THE WATER - DAY A huge shark swimming just under the surface . The fragment of oar comes into scene , thrown by Mike , hits him in the back and he disappears .  --  4  --  8 : A LONGER SHOT From about forty feet back of the boat . In the foreground we see the fins of a school of large sharks . They are swimming slowly , following the boat , waiting for the men to die . In the background is the helpless dory , Mike standing up . His face twists in hatred , and he curses the sharks . &nbsp; MIKE MASCARENA ( curses in Portuguese ) Corja maldita ... Steele waiteeng fore me to jump overboard een your mouts -- like Comes wen ee went crazee last night ,  - -  and Toro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you weel never get me .

Feebly he puts it to his swollen lips , and starts to drink . 10 : EXT . DORY - DAY - CLOSEUP OF FERNANDEZ He is watching Pipes drink -- madness in his eyes . He reaches for the evil-looking fish knife at his belt , and starts to crawl toward the stern . 11 : EXT . DORY - DAY - FULL SHOT OF DORY Mike is still standing up -- cursing the sharks . &nbsp; MIKE MASCARENATiger Sharkes , are you .. ? Keeleres .. I ave keeled a dousand of you ... I ave run de sea red weed your blod . As Mike reviles the sharks , Fernandez crawls toward Pipes . His eyes glitter wildly and he tries to wet his parched lips with his tongue in anticipation of the water . He stumbles over the seat , and seizes the water can . Pipes resists feebly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurch of the boat , caused by his movement , attracts Mike 's attention . He turns and catches the madman 's  --  5  --  wrist , just as the knife is falling . ( NOTE : The water can is upset , and the little remaining water spills and is lost . ) Mike and Fernandez look in a death struggle . At first the much larger Fernandez seems to have the better of it , but Mike 's relentless bulldog attack batters him down . But Fernandez picks up the knife which Mike wrenched from his hand and dropped to the bottom of the boat when the fight started . Fernandez slashes Mike across the shoulder . With a last desperate effort of his failing strength , Mike seizes the man 's wrist , twists his body over his shoulder , and throws him into the ocean . He is instantly seized by sharks . 12 : CLOSE UP WATER SHOT Fernandez taken by the sharks . He screams . 13 : EXTERIOR BOAT - DAY - CLOSE UP ON MIKE He is watching Fernandez go down , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . 14 : EXTERIOR OCEAN - DAY - FULL SHOT OF THE BOAT With Mike 's back in foreground , and the sharks making a commotion in the water over Fernandez 's body in background .

You blodtirsty wite bellied cannibals . As he ends the speech , he hurls the bloody knife at them , and the effort is too much for him . He stumbles and falls to the bottom of the boat , but still his will is stronger even than fate . He struggles to his feet , balancing himself with difficulty , his shirt soaked with blood . As his head comes up again , we see -- a mile or two away -- the approaching hull of a rescue ship . 15 : EXTERIOR - OPEN BOAT - DAY - CLOSE UP OF MIKE As his eyes widen and his face twists with almost insane delight . Completely losing his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts insanely. 16 : EXTERIOR : OPEN BOAT - DAY - FULL SHOT OF THE BOAT Mike bends down in a frenzy , and shakes Pipes . &nbsp; MIKE MASCARENAThey 're coming ! .. Pipes , there they are . We 're saved . But Pipes is unconscious and can not answer , so Mike turns his attention to the sharks . &nbsp; MIKE MASCARENA ( screaming at the sharks --  babbling incoherently ) Look at dat .... Tought you cood get Mike Mascarenhas ... corja maldita , bot you ca n't . You weel never get me ... I weel get you ... I weel beet you to dead on de deck of my boat and feed de rats een de old on your eyes . The emotional shock of the approaching rescue boat , plus his fearful exertions in the fight with Fernandez , overcome him . Screaming curses at the sharks , he falls fainting against the gunwale , one hand dragging in the water . 17 : CLOSE UP - MIKE 'S PROSTRATE BODY Across the gunwale .
