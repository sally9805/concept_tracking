Before Depression the volume of new capital that poured into industry was a torrent . Then it dwindled to a trickle . The figures on the prolonged drought in new financing : <P> 1929 $8,639,000,000 <P> 1932 325,000,000 <P> 1933 161,000,000 <P> 1934 178,000,000 <P> 1935 403,000,000 <P> 1936 1,217,000,000 <P> 1937 ( 8 mos. ) . . . 918,000,000 <P> Why the trickle has not yet returned to a torrent is explained in part by the kind of backwater which last week became apparent in Wall Street . <P> Underwriters now are strictly regulated by the Securities &; Exchange Commission . To the public this may have meant , as recently claimed by onetime SEChairman James M. Landis , a $1,000,000,000 saving from stock swindles . But last week underwriters found themselves in a genuine jam as the result of the past two months ' stock tumble first real smash of the Roosevelt Bull Market of the past two years which this week set new lows for the year . <P> Under SEC regulation it often takes : six months to launch a new capital issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get approval for sale . This caused little trouble so long as stock prices were going up . Since prices have been falling there has been utmost confusion . Perfect example was an issue of $44,000,000 offered by Pure Oil Co. and underwritten by 42 firms headed by Edward B. Smith &; Co . The new $100 preferred stock was made convertible into four and one-half shares of authorized common , thus evaluating the common at $22.22 per share . But while the prospectus was brewing , Pure Oil tumbled from $20 to $14 a share . So stockholders took only about $800,000 of the new issue and the underwriters had to absorb the rest . <P> Similar was the fate of $48,000,000 of Bethlehem Steel debentures . In the month beginning Sept. 8 when they were offered , Bethlehem stockholders bought but $2,000,000 worth . Last week , therefore , the underwriters had to take over the remainder of the issue and offer it to the public . The 25 underwriting firms , headed by Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , bought the debentures at $98 , intending to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . But during the month they were obliged to wait for company stockholders to buy , the market fell so far that last week Bethlehem 's debentures had to be offered at $95.50 . The price promptly fell to $93 , and still the public did not buy many . Result was at least a $1,725,000 loss to the underwriters . <P> Certain other issues had a better fate last week , notably that of Continental Can Co. whose $20,000,000 of preferred stock , offered at $100 a share , went at a premium of $102 , to the vast delight of Goldman , Sachs &; Co . Similarly , a new firm named Lane-Wells Co. ( which owns a unique process of " blowing in " oil wells with something called a " gun-perforator " ) successfully sold 40,000 shares at $15 each in its first public financing to the joy of Hartley Rogers &; Co . But Continental Can is unusually strong and Lane-Wells enjoys unusual earnings . Other companies , less well fattened , have an understandable reluctance to enter the market at present . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 135 new capital issues were being held up by the underwriters in hopes of better market conditions . Total backwater : at least $100,000,000.
