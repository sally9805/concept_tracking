txt Extension of the city 's threepoint emergency relief tax program for another year after its expiration date of June 30 , 1936 , will be made necessary by mounting relief demands , Mayor La Guardia said yesterday at City Hall . The three taxes whose proceeds go solely for emergency relief are expected to have raised more than $65,000,000 by June 30 . The city 's 2 per cent sales tax will run close to $42,000,000. about $2,000,000 more than its estimated yield . The business tax will raise about $6,500,000 and the utility tax will bring in another $18,000,000 . The utility tax was originally expected to net between $11,000,000 r'nd $12,000,000 , but collections have indicated realization of the larger total . When the last Legislature extend-1 ed the city 's emergency taxing power from Dec. 31 of this year to next June , the city agreed to abandon its proposed levies on income and inheritance . The city income tax has already been repealed , and no collections were made upon it . Collections have been made on . the inheritance tax , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Municipal Assembly . The repeal carried the stipulation that collections made . up to the date of repeal would be legalized . Action on the repeal still remains to be taken by both branches of the Municipal Assembly . Mayor La Guardia said increased demands for various forms of relief made extension of the tax program necessary . He emphasized particularly the mandatory increases in relief for veterans . He was asked if there would be any surplus from the $65,000,000 tax program at its expiration . Under State law the proceeds from these taxes could be used for no purpose other than relief . Should there be a surplus , however , it was believed new legislation could be obtained to legalize its use in other channels . Far from expecting a surplus , the Mayor said he was frankly worried about the financing of relief after next June 30 . Under present circumstances , he declared , the extension of the taxes was absolutely necessary . Apart from the relief tax situation , the city 's 1936 budget shows signs of a substantial increase . Although the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increased budget contributes no help to the general picture . The current city budget is $553,432 , - 599.90 . The 1934 budget was $551 , 047,782.06 and the 1933 budget $518 , - 427,972.16 . Departmental requests for next year have shown increases over the 1935 budget in virtually every instance . Although the La Guardia administration is deeply concerned over the city 's ability to carry the relief load , a solution of the problem may be found in the establishment of a State agency to take over the burden for the entire State . Governor Lehman has a commission now at work studying relief administration , and the commission is expected to make its final report to the Legislature next February . Permanent Relief Envisioned . The Governor 's commission , headed by Allan Wardwell , has submitted a preliminary report expressing its conviction that relief must be I regarded as a permanent problem . The commission has definitely ree1 ommended that this problem be handled on a permanent basis by a State agency . When the commission submits its final report , it is I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent basis . Regardless , of business improvement , the commission has decided that relief will be a permanent problem as far as large masses of the , population are concerned . Already there have been convincing indications that the Federal work relief program in New York City will fall short of employing 250,000 persons . Originally the WPA plan contemplated taking 150,000 from home relief rolls and adding them to the 100,000 already on work relief . As the transfer progressed it became increasingly clear that no such number could be shifted . Relief administrators now believe at least 50,000 persons must remain on home relief in New York City . The Home Relief Bureau , therefore , will play a much larger part in the general program than had originally been planned for it under the Works Progress Administration . Easing of Burden Expected . A State-wide relief agency would be supported by State-wide taxes specifically devoted to relief . Many up-State communities that have been raising relief money through bond issues have reached a point where they find it almost impossible to sell more bonds . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - out of current revenues . The only real solution for them , therefore , is a State relief agency that would take over the local burden . Under a State agency New York City still would contribute the bulk of State relief taxes , but the tax burden probably would not be so heavy as it is now . New York City Is having its troubles with labor unions over ' WPA 's failure to provide the prevailing rate of wages for skilled Men on WPA projects . General Hugh S. Johnson , Works Progress Administrator for the city , conferred with Mayor La Guardia yesterday after the Mayor had gone over that problem with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park the day before . Harry Hopkins , Federal Works Administrator , also took a , hand in trying to straighten out the matter . President Roosevelt is expected to announce a compromise arrangement within a few days that will give the unions rates approaching those they seek .
