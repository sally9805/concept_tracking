txt The EZAACMO , or Eastern Zone Army Air Corps Mail Operations , awaited orders yesterday from the War Department curtailing its flying of the air Mail . Major B. Q. Jones and his staff had heard only unofficially of the letter of the President to the Secretary of War , limiting the mail flying as the result of the loss of several army lives since the Air Corps took over the job from the private contractors on Feb. 19 . Meanwhile , snow and bad flying conditions grounded mail ships in and out of Newark Airport . Lieutenant Elwood Quesada , forced down at Kylertown , Pa. , by bad weather , came in at 12:30 P. M. Two hours ahead of him and five hours overdue , Lieutenant G. P. Moody struggled in with a load of mail from Cleveland . He had had a thrilling ride . For three hours he wandered in the fog which covered the Eastern area in the early hours . His radio was not functioning properly and the snow squalls and thick weather kept getting worse . It looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to bail out . Over Martins Creek , Pa. , he found a hole in the ground fog , however , and landed . Then , having got his bearings , he took off again and brought the mail through the snow flurries to Newark . Commercial Lines Quit . Commercial air lines at the field canceled their runs after early afternoon as the weather conditions continued to get worse . Transcontinental and Western Air did not ' run its morning trip to the Pacific Coast . United Airlines operated until 1 o'clock and then canceled an incoming plane from Chicago being held at Albany , whither it had detoured . American Airways operated its last plane for the day when the Boston run came in at 1 o'clock . The body of Lieutenant Otto Wienecke , crack army pilot , who was killed when his plane crashed in a snow squall early Friday morning , twenty miles from Cleveland , arrived at Grand Central Station . It was met by Captain S. J. Grogan of Major Jones 's staff , and transshipped to Patchogue , the flier 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Doyle , John Kehie and Robert Starrett of Mitchel Field . Mayor E. Agate Foster and a police detail met the body at the town line and joined the escort to the home of the flier 's parents , Mr. and Mrs. Richard Wienecke , at 15 Baker Street . Funeral services will be held at 2 o'clock today at Emanuel Luth- eran Church , with interment in Cedar Grove Cemetery . Army officers and a firing squad under Colonel Howard will attend . A group of army planes will fly over the church and grave during the services . Pending receipt of detailed orders , no officer in the zone was prepared to say to what extent the air mail schedules would be further reduced as a result of the President 's order . Before the cancellation , commercial lines were flying about 155,000 miles each twentyfour hours ; most of it with mail . The army 's daily flying under the schedules which went into effect Feb. 19 was about 30,000 miles . Since the cancellation , one commercial line alone , carrying passengers and express , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles daily . in the hands of private operators for the eight-year period from 1926 to 1933 , inclusive , was 59 cents a mile , according to figures made public yesterday by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America . For the preceding eightyear period , from 1918 to 1925 , inclusive , under government operation , the cost was $1.02 a mile . The government flew 10,737,060 miles and carried 8,484,396 pounds of mail , the figures show , while the private operators flew 159,472,886 miles and carried 43,818,133 pounds . Growth in America Shown . In a comparison of American and European scheduled air transport , the statistical study shows how rapid has been the growth of this field of transportation in America which , in 1926 , lagged far behind Europe but now far surpasses it . In passenger carrying , for example , the figures are as follows : 1926 America 5,782 Europe 150,095 1927 America 12,594 Europe 244,141 1928 America 52,934 Europe 222.036 1929 America 165,263 Europe 231,761 1930 America 385,910 Europe 251,332 1931 America 457,753 Europe 260.611 1932 America 504,575 Europe 318,743 For 1933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure for Europe is not yet available . The term Europe used in the chamber 's study includes lines originating in Europe but ending far afield , such as Imperial Airways ' services to Africa and India , the Royal Dutch Lines to Java , French lines to Africa and IndoChina , &c.; The American figures include , similarly , the service of Pan American Airways to Latin America . The argument has been made that America 's magnificent distances make it a much more logical ground for the development of aviation than the more restricted European countries , The chamber 's studies reveal , however , that the miles of airway classed as European , in 1932 , were 82,833 , as compared with 48,530 for America . On the other hand , American planes flew 48,344,358 miles as compared with 21,962,795 of flying for the European lines . The cost per mile of carrying air mail was M.3 cents in the United States in 1932 as compared with 188.7 cents in Europe . The cost per pound in the United States was $3.42 in that year as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 33 cents a mile in 1933.
