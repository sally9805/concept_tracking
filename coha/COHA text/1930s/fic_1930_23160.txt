A PRISONER OF MEMORY A STORY BY WALTER GILKYSON 4 R. MENDENHALL KENT did n't like Judge Kenderline . Three years ago the Judge had reproved him for taking up too much time in the trial of a case . And so , when he met the Judge in the hall at Rennyson Hobart 's Wistar party , he bowed to him with the courtesy which he kept for people he did n't like and then walked upstairs without paying any more attention to him . Wistar parties were among the rare occasions which took Mr. Mendenhall Kent from his Spruce Street house at night . The two Assemblies , the Legal Club , the meetings of the American Philosophical Society , and these after-dinner parties of gentlemen made up his social life in Philadelphia . It had grown steadily narrower since the death of his wife until now , at the age of sixty-eight , he found himself keeping up mainly through habit and a desire not to lose all sight of his old friends . A slender , fragile figure , he walked with short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were twenty or more gentlemen standing about , and he greeted them and then went over to the sideboard . " I presume , of course , that the liquor is pre-war , " he remarked to Judge Mitchell of the Superior Court . " Certainly . I always presume that without asking ; then I 'm safe . " The Judge lifted a shrewd eyebrow and surveyed Mr. Kent . " Quite so , " said Mr. Kent absentmindedly . He had noticed a new Albert Ryder on the opposite wall . When the opportunity came he went over and looked at it . " Modern , " someone said in a disagreeable voice , and he straightened up and confronted Judge Kenderline , who was standing behind him . " No , " he suggested firmly , " it 's not at all modern , Judge . " Judge Kenderline flushed . " It looks it . " " I 'm sorry , but it does n't resemble the modern work in the least . " " You talk like a connoisseur . " The Judge 's dark face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose you collect pictures , like Mr. John C. Johnson ? " " Not at all . I 'm afraid I do n't resemble a leader of the bar in any respect . I have had occasion to look at pictures , that 's all . " ( This scowling young man with his Indian face and lank hair should be taught a lesson . ) " I believe the law is an art and as such is germane to the other arts , and I see no reason why a lawyer should n't understand pictures , just as he understands literature and history . In fact most of them do . " He smiled with gentle reproof , and then folded his hands across the buttons of his white waistcoat . " You think the law is an art , do you ? " His little lecture had evidently hit the mark . " Come up sometime to 657 and see how much art you find ! " " I have been in 657 , " said Mr. Kent . " I tried cases in 657 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school . " The Judge stared at him . He was plainly angry , now . Your kind do n't come into the criminal courts ? " " We should . That is , conceding I belong to a different kind , which I do n't . I often regret , Judge , that I have no occasion to go there . No one of us is good enough to be exempt from the rough and tumble of the ring . I have sometimes thought , with my knowledge of Italian ? " " You speak Italian ? " " I lived in Italy . " " And you like the wops ? " " I know the Italians and I 've been entertained in their homes . I do n't call them wops . " " No ? " Judge Kenderline 's smile was cynical and amused . " If you like the Italians so much I 'll give you a chance to prove it . I 'll appoint you to defend an Italian who 's been indicted for murder . " Mr. Kent closed his lips , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew a deep breath and then swallowed deliberately . " I shall be happy to accept any appointment you may send me , " he said . Then he bowed , and walked over to the sideboard with short precise steps and poured himself a drink . That remark about knowing Italian had done it , he decided , as he walked home when the party was over . All day , consciously and unconsciously , his mind had been upon Italy . It was spring , and these soft days of late April always brought back memories of his wife and the lake and Balbianello . Virgilia had loved Italy and their home on the lake ; because of his father they had been graciously received by the Italian aristocracy , and their life together had been very gay , very muchlike living in an illustrated history book . Only once had he gone back in all these forty-five years , and then it had been unbearable . Virgilia would have approved of his replies to the Judge . She had always shared his affection for the Italians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner , whoever be was , had a vigorous and painstaking defense . He did n't try many cases now and he had n't been in a criminal court for fifteen years . But whatever he lacked in skill , he would try to make up for by diligence and sympathy . In the morning , at precisely ten minutes to nine , he walked down to his office in the Land Title Building . His assistant , Mr. Clarkson , was helping Miss Mildren sort out the mail , and he told them both about the appointment , feeling a little pleased at the look of pride that came over Miss Mildren 's face . She and Clarkson were his only office companions ; he had always preferred a small organization of his own to an association with other lawyers . His practice was largely in the Orphans Court , and he did n't need anyone but Miss Mildren and Clarkson , who was an excellent accountant , to help him . He sat down at the desk and picked up the opinion of the Court in Lane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . The Judges had quoted very largely from his brief and had cited three of his earlier cases involving the Estate . It was a sound opinion , quite in line with the precedents that had grown up around Hodges Estate . He put the opinion away in the cardboard file on the top of his desk . It was generally recognized by the bar that he was the authority in Hodges Estate . When Miss Mildren knocked at the door an hour later he was hard at work . " Here 's your appointment , " she announced . He glanced at it , feeling a little startled at seeing his name so close to that of the Criminal Court . The prisoner was one Alessandro Benvolente . In English that would be Alexander the Well-wisher . For a moment Mr. Kent wondered whether Alexander the Well-wisher was guilty . Then he dismissed the thought . It was his duty to believe Alexander innocent until the contrary was proved . He rose , took his hat from the tree , and opened the door of the outer office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new client , " he said . On the way up he realized that he was not appropriately dressed for an interview with a person in jail . The morning coat and striped trousers and cloth-topped patent-leather boots which he invariably wore might be unsuitable for the occasion  --  might , in fact , cast some reflection upon the condition of his client . He believed in dignity and the preservation of form ; there bad grown up an informality at the bar which he greatly disliked . Men who ought to know better had taken to wearing loose tweeds , colored collars , unseemly ties , and soft , shapeless hats , and to calling one another by their first names in a very familiar manner . He had always stood out against such customs , but now  --  he gazed in the mirror of the jolting taxi at his bat-wing collar and impeccable tie with the small polka dots  --  now he wished there were something younger and more athletic-looking about his clothes . The man at the door was very polite , however , and after a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , who took him upstairs to the part of the jail where Alessandro Benvolente was confined . " He 's a quiet one , " he said , as he unlocked the door of the cell . " I 'm leaving you alone with him , Counsellor , for half an hour . " He swung open the door and then shut it behind Mr. Kent with a vicious clang . Alessandro Benvolente was quiet , Mr. Kent thought . He did n't move or speak but remained sitting in the straight chair by the bed , his eyes turned toward the door , a shaft of light from the high window at his back falling over his shoulder . His gentle , recessive face and long mustaches looked luminous behind the light ; with his drooping pose and calm , vacant gaze he had the air of a Chinese saint engaged in meditation . Mr. Kent was moved . The innocence , the unstudied artlessness of the man filled him with compassion . " I am your lawyer , Alessandro , " he said in Italian . Alessandro rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have come to defend you . " Mr. Kent waited for Alessandro , who had seated himself on the bed , to speak . He remained silent , and Mr. Kent began to feel embarrassed . The man is afraid , he thought . I must reassure him . " The court is interested in your defense and has appointed me to serve as your lawyer . " He smiled , hoping Alessandro would reply , but his face did n't change ; he only continued his mild , impassive scrutiny . Mr. Kent , resolved to be patient , looked away , then undid his briefcase and took out a pad of manila paper . " You can talk to me freely , " he said . " I shall ask you questions , if you prefer , and you can answer them . " Alessandro either did n't hear him or did n't understand . The man is an innocent ; he is a simple Sicilian shepherd caught in the toils of our civilization , Mr. Kent thought . " Where were you born , Alessandro ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Alessandro . His voice had a surprising quality , as if some rich instrument had remained long unused . " You call up Giorgio Monti at the Restaurant Calabrese . " He nodded , as if to re-assure Mr. Kent , and then relapsed into vacancy . " But I do n't know Giorgio Monti ! " " You call him . He knows every-thing -- everything that I shall say in court . Please ! Ile leaned forward , pressing the palms of his hands together . " Giorgio Monti at the Restaurant Calabrese . He will tell you all , Signore , that you want to know . " " But I must talk to you ? " " I can not talk . " Alessandro sighed ; then his face grew impassive and he stared into space . He had withdrawn from the scene , leaving Mr. Kent baffled and alone . In the twenty minutes that followed all Mr. Kent could learn from him was the address of the Restaurant Calabrese . When the turnkey came Alessandro rose with simple dignity and held out his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bowed to the turnkey who gave Mr. Kent an enormous wink . As soon as Mr. Kent returned to the office he told Miss Mildren to telephone the Restaurant Calabrese and ask Mr. Giorgio Monti to call upon him without delay . And at half past two , just when he was feeling a little drowsy from lunch , she knocked at the door and said that the Italian had come . " Send him in , " he said , swinging round in his chair so his back would be to the light . He must n't appear sleepy , but the shad roe at the club had been very large . It might be better to take down the questions and answers himself . Miss Mildren was naturally delicate-minded , and without any experience in the more degrading aspects of life . This case was likely to prove unpleasant . . . Then the door opened and a short , stout man with blackberry eyes and a big sagging mouth came rolling into the room . " Signor Giorgio Monti ? " Mr. Kent asked , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You speak our language ! " he exclaimed , plunging toward the chair with outstretched arms , as if he were about to embrace Mr. Kent . " Yes , " said Mr. Kent . " Sit down , please . " He felt he would be more comfortable if the man sat down . " Naturally I speak Italian . In my youth I lived in Italy . " " How beautiful ! Imagine ! Think of it ! " Signor Monti eased himself into the armchair in front of Mr. Kent . " For pleasure  --  to absorb the beauty of our scenery , and our glorious history , and to spread the limbs in our sunny warmth ? " " Well , yes , among other reasons . " In order to show his interest in the case it might be necessary , at the expense of good taste , to impress Signor Monti . " My father was the American Minister to Italy at one time . " " How beautiful ! Think of it ! What a distinction ! " Signor Monti 's fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples myself . It is an honor to sit in the presence of one who has represented the great country of my adoption at the court of Mussolini . Rome the Eternal ! " He raised his right arm in a Fascist salute . " And America , the land of my adoption . America is better . " His small , shrewd mouth closed with a faint smack . " In some ways , yes . " Mr. Kent wondered whether he had n't better correct Signor Monti 's impression that he had been Minister to Italy , and then decided to do it later . " My purpose in sending for you is this , " he said , handing him the appointment . " Alessandro Benvolente refused to talk and referred me to you . " Signor Monti glanced at the appointment . " Your stenographer told me you had been requested by the court to defend my poor unfortunate friend . I had already employed Milliken Henn but I shall discharge him immediately . With your knowledge , your distinction , and above all your love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in better hands . " Mr. Kent felt uncomfortable . " My experience in criminal cases has not been large , " he began . " That is unimportant . " Signor Monti 's eyebrows flew up , and lie lifted his arms in protestation . " There is not a jury in the world that would find my poor unfortunate friend guilty . He is the victim of a conspiracy . A humble proprietor of a cigar store , he was unfortunate enough to incur the jealousy of a young Italian woman . It is an affair of Jove . " Signor Monti 's blackberry eyes became soft . " The young woman , enraged by love , is the only witness against Alessandro . Out of the pain and disappointment in her heart she says she saw Alessandro shoot Francesco Cdlardoni at eleven o'clock at night from the pavement at the corner of Ninth and Christian Streets . Cold-blooded murder ! You know , Your Excellency  --  you have seen Alessandro Benvolente  --  you know that that is impossible ! " " He looked like a very quiet man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Your Excellency ; it was my father who was Minister to Italy . " " No matter . " Signor Monti shrugged his shoulders as if dismissing a needless interruption . " I have thirteen witnesses for the defense , " he announced . " Alessandro 's aunt and four cousins , who will prove the insane jealousy of the sole witness for the State , a young woman who disgraces the laud of her birth and of her adoption under the name of Dina Malezzi . " He scowled , then patted his large stomach consolingly . " I have eight witnesses who will prove that at the precise moment of the killing Alessandro was in his cigar store , fulfilling his Bumble duties to the citizens of Philadelphia . The young men are all of good reputation and known to me who am the proprietor of the Restaurant Calabrese . " He reached in his pocket , took out a card , and handed it to Mr. Kent . " Whenever you wish to see the witnesses I shall bring them to you . You are an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last found good fortune . The man who was killed was an evil character , a bootlegger of the worst reputation , and it would be a calamity if my innocent friend should suffer for his death . I am the protector of the weak and ignorant in my community , and I shall undertake for you the complete preparation of your case . Until we meet again , Your Excellency . " He lifted his broad black hat with a flourish , placed it on his head , and then rolled out of the room . Mr. Kent felt slightly dazed . He looked down at the manila pad . The man had talked so much that he had n't made many notes . It seemed like a good case . An alibi established by eight witnesses , and an aunt and four cousins of the defendant to prove the jealousy of the sole witness for the State . The man who was killed was a bootlegger and , therefore , a criminal . Alessandro certainly was n't a criminal . Mr. Kent sighed , thinking of the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with the Sicilian shepherds . She would have understood Alessandro . He would not have remained so fearful and shy in her presence . The witnesses who appeared with Giorgio Monti the next day turned out to be just as good as he said , and at the close of the examination Mr. Kent felt very confident of his ease . So a month later , when he crossed over to City Hal ! on Tuesday at eight o'clock , surrounded by Giorgio and nearly twenty Italians , his step was elastic and his heart , although beating too fast , was light . He was on the right side and he could use all his powers of persuasion and in-dulge all his natural sympathies in the coming trial . When they reached the sixth floor of City Hall Mr. Kent decided it would be better to leave Giorgio and the witnesses in one of the anterooms of 657 , so that the District Attorney should n't see them before they took the stand . He had no doubt of the truth of their testimony ; but it was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He explained this to Giorgio , who without demur shepherded the flock into one of the side rooms . Then Mr. Kent , alone , pushed open the swinging doors of 657 and walked down the aisle to the chairs reserved for members of the bar . It had been such a long while since he had attended criminal court that he could n't help feeling a little nervous . The room was nearly full , and the court officers , with their accustomed brusqueness , were pushing the spectators into seats . A tipstaff was arranging papers in front of the Judge 's empty chair , and in the space below , between the rail and the bench , the District Attorney and the Court Stenographer were talking together . The District Attorney was a young man with spectacles and a thin face . Mr. Kent did n't know him . He did n't know any of the lawyers in the court . They seemed to be of a different class from the criminal lawyers of fifteen years ago . The Court Crier rose , and his voice went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kent stood up . Judge Kenderline was coming through the door behind the bench . He was going to preside ; that might be fortunate or unfortunate , Mr. Kent could n't tell . The Judge had a reputation for fairness . He had probably forgotten the incident of last month . The District Attorney was talking to him now , so Mr. Kent sat down . At the far door to the left a man from the Sheriff 's office came in with Alessandro Benvolente . It looked as if the case were going to be called right away . The Judge glanced over the lawyers until his eyes rested upon Mr , Kent . " Are you ready ? " he asked . " Yes , sir . " " Any motions ? " " No , sir . " The Judge began sorting over the papers on the bench . " Call a jury in Commonwealth versus Benvolente , " he said to the tipstaff . Mr. Kent took his seat at the defendant 's table and beckoned to the officer in charge of Alessandro . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down . He was neat and clean and quite undisturbed by what was going on . Mr. Kent felt a glow of pride as he patted him on the arm . Alessandro , he felt sure , would impress the jury . With the jury list on the table before him , Mr. Kent very carefully put down the proper number after the name of each man as he was called . Then he rose politely and interrogated the juror , being careful to elicit any prejudice he might have against Italians , Latins , or even foreigners . The untraveled citizens of Philadelphia , from among whose number the jury was necessarily drawn , might through ignorance be possessed of some racial antagonism , some unworthy suspicion , concerning persons of another land and speech . Such contamination he must be zealous to discover and avoid . Alessandro , a helpless stranger , must be tried by citizens of an impartial mind . That was the glory of the law and the privilege of his client . As an officer of the court , he had a sacred duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juror peremptorily , because of some gesture , expression , or trick of speech that seemed dangerous . It was afternoon when the trial actually began , and not until the next morning did the material witnesses for the commonwealth take the stand . Alessandro , it appeared , had been found in New York by the police the day after the murder . When discovered he was hiding in a tenement house on Second Avenue . Upon cross-examination Mr. Kent showed there was no evidence of when Alessandro had arrived . He had visited the tenement house before ; as far as the witnesses knew , he might have come any time that day . Francesco Gillardoni had been seen at Alessandro 's cigar store half an hour before the murder . Warily Mr. Kent cut around the testimony . There had been no altercation between the two men . They had not been seen leaving the cigar store together . At about eleven o'clock that night Alessandro had passed the corner of Eighth and Christian Streets with Francesco Gillardoni . There was no evidence of a quarrel . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good judge of time . In the tests which Mr. Kent put to him , watch in hand , he thought five minutes was half an hour . The silver top of a flask , marked " A. B. , " was found by the police near the gutter on the southeast side of Ninth and Christian Streets . In the preceding months Alessandro had purchased a silver flask from a pawnbroker , who testified that the initials engraved on the top were " A. B. " With this testimony the court adjourned , leaving the cross-examination of the witness until the following morning . Mr. Kent gathered up his papers and put them in his bag . That last piece of evidence had raised an unpleasant doubt in his mind . It would be hard to explain away such a simple and damaging fact . But it was equally hard to imagine Alessandro buying a silver flask . Alessandro was not given to ornament ; he was n't even adorned with a collar and necktie . There must be some explanation for the presence of the flask . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Alessandro , " he said . Then he joined the witnesses and Giorgio in their place of concealment , and together they returned to the office . Giorgio , when Mr. Kent told him about the flask , was surprisingly calm . " Your Excellency , I am familiar with that transaction , " he said . " As Alessandro will tell you , he purchased that flask for the benefit of one Aristideo Bertini , who in turn gave it to a young man who has since returned to his native country . If you will permit me , I shall bring to your office now the said Aristideo Bertini , who will unfold to Your Excellency the complete history of the flask . " Mr. Kent was relieved . There was something reassuring about the very name Aristideo . " Giorgio , you are a great help , " he said . It was precisely as Giorgio had stated . Aristideo , a most reliable looking young man , had bought the flask from Alessandro and then given it to an Italian who had just returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroborated in every detail the story of Aristideo . Notwithstanding his apparent ignorance , Alessandro had a remarkable memory . Mr. Kent felt strengthened for the coming ordeal . The next morning , after fixing in the jury 's mind the date of the sale of the flask , Mr. Kent turned the witness over for re-direct examination . " That 's all , " said the District Attorney absently . He was hunting through the papers on his desk . " Dina Malezzi , " he called . Mr. Kent sat up . He knew that his real battle had begun . Dina was young and pretty , and she made a good impression on the jury . She had seen Alessandro , at eleven o'clock on the night of the murder , running away from the corner of Ninth and Christian Streets , where , a few minutes later , the dead man had been found . She also testified that there was a pistol in Alessandro 's hand . As the District Attorney turned her over to him for cross-examination Mr. Kent made a quick decision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , if you had n't seen him before , would you ? " " No , sir . " " So you knew him well  --  you had been to his house ? " " Yes , sir . " " Many times ? " " Yes , sir . " " And for quite a long while you had known him ? " She paused . " A few years , maybe ? " " Yes , sir . " " But you had n't seen him ? " Mr. Kent hesitated , then decided to take the risk , " You had n't seen him for a month , say , before the night of the killing ? " She paused again , as if thinking . " I do n't think so , no , sir , " she answered . " That 's all , " said Mr. Kent , sitting down . The District Attorney looked at him with surprise . Judge Kenderline swung up to the bench , his eyes sardonic and inquiring . " Call the next witness , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's our case , " the District Attorney answered , and the Judge glanced across the room at the clock . " We have time for your opening speech , Mr. Kent . After that we 'll adjourn , and you can put on your witnesses to-morrow morning . " When the speech was over the crier ? adjourned the court . " May I see you a moment ? " the District Attorney called , and Mr. Kent walked over to the bench . " How long will you be to-morrow ? " " We ought to finish sometime during the day . " Judge Kenderline nodded . " You ought to finish by noon , at the rate you 're going . That was a good piece of cross-examination , if you 'll permit me to say so . Between your skill and your client 's looks he could get away with murder before the jury . " The Judge must think Alessandro was guilty , Mr. Kent decided , as he walked down the aisle and across to the anteroom where Giorgio and the witnesses were concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a natural bias which came from trying so many criminals . But at any rate he was fair . Not once during the trial had he been anything but fair . And to-morrow  --  Mr. Kent thought of the fourteen witnesses , and his confidence returned . To-morrow would certainly be a field-day for Alessandro . The next morning at ten o'clock he opened his case . To remove any doubt in the jury 's mind about the flask , he put Aristideo Bertini on the stand and asked him to tell what had happened . The evidence which Aristideo gave was unstudied and surprisingly complete . The District Attorney could n't lead him into the slightest contradiction . His modest demeanor and quiet certainty bore the earmarks of truth . Alessandro 's aunt took the stand next and was followed by each of her daughters . Their testimony was perfect ; the witness Dina Malezzi had sought to marry Alessandro and had been repulsed . Each woman had seen at least one frantic incident in Alessandro 's long and determined retreat from love . They testified earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonant with truth . They were unshakable , and at the end of the cross-examination the District Attorney grew peevish . Mr. Kent saw one of the jurors nodding to the other . It was a good sign . The tide of battle was flowing toward Alessandro . After the eight men had testified and been cross-examined , Mr. Kent felt certain of the result . Alessandro 's alibi had been proved ; the District Attorney had been unable to shake one single witness . There remained only Alessandro himself , and in a few minutes his testimony was over . Mr. Kent listened anxiously as the District Attorney began his cross-examination . Then he at back with a little sigh of relief . Alessandro , in spite of his innocence , could take care of himself . When the cross-examination was over the District Attorney beckoned to Mr. Kent , and together they went round the railing to the bench . " I 'd like to adjourn , if your Honor please , until to-morrow morning , " the District Attorney said . " This defense has come as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's witnesses . " " That 's an extraordinary request , " said Mr. Kent . He looked sternly at the District Attorney and then at the Judge . " The cost of this court to the Commonwealth , if your Honor please , has been estimated at three dollars a minute . I can see no reason for delaying the trial and keeping the jury locked up over night to allow the Commonwealth to prepare its case . " The Judge frowned . " The case ought to go on , Harry , " he said . " Have you any evidence that these witnesses are n't telling the truth ? " " Not exactly , no , although I suspeet ? " " That 's unworthy ! " A. flush came into Mr. Kent 's cheeks . " Unless you have evidence you have no right to suspect my witnesses . You are exceeding your duties as an officer of the court when you entertain such suspicions without evidence . " The District Attorney looked down . He was n't a very aggressive young man . " If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three years ago , you criticized me for taking up too much time in the trial of a case , and I have been careful not to repeat that error to-day . I object strongly to the adjournment suggested by my learned young friend ; I am ready to go to the jury now , and I see no reason why , when the life of a man is at stake , his agony should be prolonged while my learned young friend satisfies some vague suspicion that he himself admits is without foundation and should not be main-tained . " The Judge smiled . " I did criticize you once but I thought you 'd forgotten it . Harry , there is n't any real reason why this case should be held up , and you 'd better go on . I doubt if you 'd find anything , anyway . The Italian 's a good actor ; he always puts on a good show . " The Judge leaned back in his chair and pulled the robe up over the lapels of his coat . " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try these cases as they come . " Mr. Kent returned to his seat . That was the end of that ! " We shall finish to-day , " he said to Alessandro . The District Attorney was standing before the jury , beginning his summing-up speech . Giorgio Monti leaned over Alessandro 's shoulder and touched Mr. Kent on the arm . " When this is over we shall have a great celebration in your honor , " he whispered . As Mr. Kent stepped forward to make his closing speech to the jury he felt inspired . Behind the logic of his argument a white flame of memory burned . The silence in the court ? room , the sympathy on the faces of the jurors , the thought of Alessandro , whose life was dependent upon these few faltering words , unloosed his imagination and set free all the deepest emotion of his heart The past was rising up in him , forming his sentences , adding its burden of sorrow to his voice ; Alessandro , Giorgio Monti , all the witnesses were mere shapes through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of his years in Italy . It was youth crying out in him , proclaiming each memory and each experience that he had cherished for forty-five years . By some strange magic all that he valued had been put upon trial , and he was defending it vehemently . When he sat down the courtroom was silent , and the jurors avoided one another 's glances , as if afraid of showing how they felt . Alessandro rustled in his chair , then nodded shyly , looking more than ever Iike a Chinese saint . Behind him Giorgio Monti was ejaculating under his breath ; he was greatly moved by the address . Then the District Attorney began his last speech , and Mr. Kent settled down to listen . As soon as the speech was over the Judge charged the jury , so fairly that Mr. Kent only took one exception to the charge . Then the jury filed out , and the crier adjourned the court , and Mr. Kent , after saying good-by to Alessandro , left the witnesses in the anteroom , and went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury had returned and he hurried over to City Hall . A verdict in such a short time must mean an acquittal . He could hardly conceal his elation as he entered the room . The Judge was on the bench , and Alessandro , in charge of an officer , was standing at the bar of the court . " How say you , gentlemen of the jury , guilty or not guilty ? " " Not guilty , " the foreman answered . Giorgio Monti was upon Mr. Kent , wringing his band . Alessandro bad taken the other hand and was kissing it , while the Judge looked down at him , frankly amused . " Congratulations , " he said . Then two newspapermen came up with a camera , and Mr. Kent posed for them between Alessandro and Giorgio . " At eight o'clock , in the Restaurant Calabrese , we shall have a great celebration in your honor , " Giorgio cried . " It is now six ; I shall call for Your Excellency at precisely quarter of eight . " When Giorgio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident that the celebration had begun . His gestures were even wider than before , and he filled the hall with an odor compounded , as far as Mr. Kent could tell , of excitement and Scotch . For an instant Mr. Kent quailed . He was very tired ; there was a heavy numbness at the base of his spine . The prospect of several hours of Italian felicitation in a noisy cafe was distressing . " I shall not stay long , " he said , buttoning up his dinner jacket and wrapping his white scarf around his neck . Hinkle , the butler , was looking at Giorgio with disapproval . Hinkle must n't he rude . " I shall be back soon , " he said to him severely . Then he opened the door and descended the steps to the taxi . According to Giorgio , it was only a few blocks to the Restaurant Calabrese . Mr. Kent had never seen the place before nor did he ever remember having been in the Italian quarter . Like everything else in Philadelphia , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street down which they had turned was filled with blinking signs and open doorways and gesticulating crowds of men . There was an air of noisy leisure about the street , as ? A PRISONER if everyone were waiting for something to happen . Mr. Kent sighed . Giorgio Monti was noisy . He had talked steadily all the way without once stopping for an answer . The bright sign of the Restaurant Calabrese spelled itself in and out across the corner . There were a lot of men standing around and they took off their hats as Giorgio and Mr. Kent got out of the taxi . Giorgio positively swaggered ; his wide black hat was tipped over to one side . Through the window in front of him Mr. Kent saw a blaze of mirrors and a multitude of small round tables filled with people . " My restaurant ! " Giorgio cried . " Every night it is thus , Your Ex-cellency . " " Indeed ! " There were so many people , and they looked so thick-haired and perspiring . One of the waiters , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapped half way up to the neck in straw . " The entrance to the banquet hall is here , Your Excellency . " Giorgio rolled out of the light , and Mr. Kent followed him through the doorway on the left and up the stairs . They were steep , and the walls on either side were dirty . From the floor above came the sound of lusty singing . Giorgio flung open the door , and the singing stopped . There were at least thirty men in the room , standing round a long table . The table glittered ; the bunting tacked to the walls threw a purple shadow over the ceiling ; the coils of tobacco smoke drifting under the light turned the tablecloth blue and veiled the faces of the men in swarthy repose . For an instant Mr. Kent felt trapped . The vitality in the room drained him of strength . Then he carefully removed his hat and bowed to the men . " Behold our savior ! " Giorgio cried . There was a ring of triumph in his voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spoke Italian and smelled very strong ; with a ghost of amusement Mr. Kent found himself wondering why they had n't earrings in their ears . " Sit down , Your Excellency . " Giorgio pushed his way to the head of the table . Alessandro was there ; be had on a stiff shirt and a long gold collar button instead of a collar and tie . Mr. Kent shook hands with him . Alessandro had survived the metamorphosis of the banquet . In the midst of his formidable friends he was still the gentle Sicilian shepherd . Mr. Kent sat down between Alessandro and Giorgio . Then the rest of the men sat down , and in a moment the singing began again . Mr. Kent remembered how the peasants had sung in the trattoria on the lake , and he tried to feel happy . Possibly it would be better if he drank something . There was Chianti in the red straw-covered bottles and a liquor that tasted like Scotch . Giorgio poured him out both . The wine was familiar ; it was surprisingly good ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Siena . " Plenty of that ! " Giorgio exclaimed , with a vast wink . " Plenty of that , Your Excellency ! " " I suppose so . " The young woman putting down the antipasto in front of him smiled . Mr. Kent half turned and looked at her . He had seen her before . Good Lord ! His fork dropped against his plate . She was one of Alessandro 's cousins , one of the witnesses at the trial ! In silence he surveyed the room . Through the drift of smoke he saw the large , pleasant face of Alessandro 's aunt , standing near the door . She was supervising the waitresses , and the rest of Alessandro 's cousins were moving about the table . One of the men flung his head back familiarly as a cousin bent over him . Mr. Kent tried to put his fork through a piece of tomato . Then he turned to Giorgio . " I see the witnesses are waiting on the table . " " In Your Excellency 's honor , " Giorgio answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on serving Your Excellency as a token of their appreciation . " Mr. Kent nodded . That might be true , but he did n't feel convinced . " They work here ? " " Yes , Your Excellency . " Giorgio took a big drink of Scotch . " All Italians work here , sooner or later . " One of Alessandro 's cousins removed Mr. Kent 's antipasto and gave him a big plate of minestrone . Down the table the singing was noisier now , without concert , and interrupted by shouting . Two men were quarrelling , and Giorgio half rose and glared at them with fierce , red-rimmed eyes . " Carlo ! Giuseppe ! " he shouted . The men scowled , then turned away from each other . " Beasts , " Giorgio muttered . " Give an Italian an inch , Your Excellency , and he takes an ell . " " You command like a Tzar , " said Mr. Kent with an attempt at gayety . He was trying to eat his soup but he could n't . This suspicion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed the nerves of his stomach . The men were shouting for music , and Giorgio beckoned to Alessandro 's aunt and whispered something to her . Mr. Kent began talking to Alessandro , who answered his questions briefly , with an air of reticence and shy pride . Every now and then some man at the table toasted Alessandro . It was evident that he was very much of a hero . They also toasted Mr. Kent , and he invariably lifted his glass and responded with a dignified nod . The orchestra was coming in . " From my restaurant downstairs , " Giorgio explained . With a quick start , Mr. Kent gasped , then his fingers tightened on the edge of the table . He forced himself to look at the orchestra again . He felt ill . The noise and smoke closed round him in a gigantic bubble . In the center his heart was fluttering painfully . There were eight men , and each man was bowing to him politely . They were sitting down now , moving their instruments about and putting their music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be losing his mind . It was that Scotch . These men were only distorted shapes of reality . They were the creatures of fever . Every man in the orchestra had been examined by him in court . It was the orchestra that had established Alessandro 's alibi . " In your honor , " said Giorgio , with a lurch that splashed the wine out on the cloth . " I have taken them from my restaurant to play in Your Excellency 's honor . When necessary they can go to court in Your Excellency 's honor , or in Alessandro 's honor , or in my honor . Ha ! " He plunged back in his chair and clapped his hands on his knees . " Your Excellency ! What do you think of that ? " " Admirable , " said Mr. Kent in a weak voice . His head was whirling round and round . These changes came so fast that he did n't seem able to recover himself . " Signori ! " Giorgio was struggling to his feet . " Silence ! I command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The room was quiet and the orchestra faced about in polite attention . " Viva the Am ba ssador ! " someone cried out but was instantly silenced. - My friends , " said Giorgio . His square body swayed toward Mr. Kent and then righted itself . Mr. Kent gazed up at him , hypnotized . The man 's face was demoniac , colossal . His eyes were black sparks . He was inspired . " My friends ! " Giorgio threw out his arms in a magnificent gesture . " This man loves us . He has lived amidst the grandeur of our mountains and has drunk in the sublime patriotism of our people . For a , lifetime he has been the Ambassador from the great country of our adoption to the holy land of our nativity . He loves us and he hates and despises our enemies . If that renegade Francesco Gillardoni were here our beloved friend would tear him in pieces ! " The room crashed and rocked about Mr. Kent in waves of frantic applause . He felt strangely exhilarated , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a great light and noise . Giorgio was looking down at him . A damp hand was upon his shoulder . There were tears of affection in Giorgio 's eyes . " I propose the last tribute ! " he cried exultantly ; " The evidence of our undying regard , of our love for our great protector ! The supreme gift ! " He thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a small black pistol . " Take it , " he said in a broken voice . " Keep it , Your Excellency , as a memorial of our unworthy affection . It is the instrument by which Alessandro revenged the treachery of Francesco Gillardoni . Take it , Your Excellency , and may it always preserve you from harm . " He sat down and buried his face in his hands . The emotion that swept over the room was too great for any sound . Alessandro shyly touched Mr. Kent 's arm . " For you , " he said , " it is good luck . " Mr. Kent rose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did n't know how to hold it . He ought to point the barrel up , toward the ceiling . They were waiting for him to make a speech . The room was quietand heavy . Through the smoke the men 's faces tipped up , then dropped away . He was dizzy . He could n't think in Italian . The words stopped in his mind , disappeared , swarmed back into meaningless English . Giorgio lifted his head , then shot out his arm at the orchestra . " Giovartezza ! ' " he shouted . " Play Giovanezza ' and we will march ! " The men rose in a thunderous rush about the table . Giorgio swung Mr. Kent around , shouting violently at the men in front of him . They pushed forward , leaving a vacant space in front of Mr. Kent . Giorgio 's hands were upon his shoulders . Dimly Mr. Kent knew that he was going to march . Possibly they might make him shoot off the pistol . The music began and Mr. Kent started forward . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were carrying a flag . The music was exhilarating ; the full , strenuous rhythms cleared the dizziness from his brain . The men were singing ; the great volume of sound rolled melodiously above the tramping of their feet . It was a beautiful and inspiring song that they sang . " Ciovamezza , giovanezza , Primavera di beliezza . " The great chorus lifted and crashed like surf through the room . Mr. Kent was singing now at the top of his voice . It was a beautiful song . " Youth , fair youth , the springtime of beauty . " The words warmed his heart . Quite transported , he marched boldly , a slender , fragile figure at the head of his company , with a small black pistol held barrel upward in his right hand . He had forgotten everything , now , but the singing . They were singing melodies that he knew . He was on the lake , and the old tidal songs of the fishermen were weaving contrapuntal harmonies in his brain . " King Barbarossa , and his red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flowing in scarlet waves down the slopes of Balbianello . " You are a rose , and the wind will scatter your petals ? " He was young again . He could march this way forever . As he approached the doorway once more , he became aware of a change . The next instant he caught sight of a large figure leaning against the wall . He faltered , and the song died in his throat . He broke step , stumbled forward , holding the pistol to his side . The singing continued behind him . They had n't seen He dropped into the nearest chair . It was impossible to look back at that door . His heart was beating furiously and he was drenched with sweat . " You are not well ? " Giorgio asked , bending over him anxiously . " Tired , " breathed Mr. Kent . He closed his lips firmly and glanced toward the door . The policeman was still there . His large boots and blue trousers were visible between the legs of the men . " Do you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stand back ! " lie shouted at the men who were crowding around . " Home ? " echoed Mr. Kent in a faint voice . He could scarcely get his breath . A vision of Judge Kenderline , sitting on the bench , came before his eyes . What could he possibly say to the Judge when he was brought into court ? " Mike ! " Giorgio called out sharply over his shoulder . " Run down and get a taxi for the gentleman . " The heavy boots and blue trousers shifted around and disappeared . " If His Excellency will arise I will attend him to his house , " Giorgio said . Mr. Kent got up . Dimly he won-dered whether he was going insane . There had been a policeman there . The policeman had gone to get him a taxi . It was fantastic ! Alessandro gently lifted his hand and kissed it . Then be took the pistol from Mr. Kent 's fingers and dropped it into the breast pocket of his dinner coat . " Safer there , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his overcoat for him , carefully tucking in the white muffler under the lapels . Supported by Giorgio and Alessandro and followed by the silent group of men , Mr. Kent got downstairs and out on the pavement . The policeman was holding open the door of the taxi . Our public servants have acquired courtesy , Mr. Kent thought vaguely . He must keep Giorgio from coming home with him . He really could n't bear any more excitement . " I should like to rest in the taxicab , so you need n't come , Giorgio . " " I understand . " Giorgio 's bow was delicacy and comprehension itself . " Good-by , gentlemen , " said Mr. Kent , with a fluttering wave of his hand toward the group on the pavement . They took off their hats and murmured in a low , musical chorus . Giorgio stepped hack , then embraced Mr. Kent and kissed him on both cheeks . " Our protector , " he proclaimed solemnly . Then he took Mr. Kent by one arm while the policeman took the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-by again , " he said , leaning out of the window as the car started . The light from the sign above the Restaurant Calabrese flickered over his face . With one accord each man on the pavement raised his right arm in a mute gesture of farewell .
