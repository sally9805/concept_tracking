Jealous as a hen with one chick is Grand Rapids of its furniture shows . Mad as a wet hen is Grand Rapids when Chicago 's bigger furniture shows are compared to Grand Rapids ' . Pointing out that at the Chicago Mart buyers can purchase anything from iron nails to beef on the hoof , Grand Rapidans boast that their Market sells only furniture . <P> Last week Grand Rapids cackled with delight as its 123rd semi-annual market opened . On display for the first time was a brand-new furniture style , designed to " perpetuate Grand Rapids ' reputation as the furniture capital of America . " Grand Rapids ( of Kent County , Michigan ) named it Kentwood . <P> Visiting buyers , 700 strong , roamed through a ten-room Kentwood House , peered and poked at beds , chairs , desks , tables and sideboards that looked like classical pieces with the classical ornaments knocked off . Modernistic extremes were lacking , but living-room furniture was scaled down in size , upholstery was in modernistic shades of blue and pink . Proud Grand Rapidans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to suit a changing world . " Purists grumbled that it was a bastard style , neither classic nor modern . <P> Kentwood was the idea of nine manufacturers* who teamed up in Depression to form the Grand Rapids Furniture Makers Guild and promote the prestige of Guild-stamped furniture . First plans were drawn by a designer named David Laing Evans , a pipe-smoking , spare-time student of astronomy . Designer Evans submitted ideas that were basically classical . Thereafter the designers for all nine Guildsmen collaborated in streamlining the classics . The pooling of their efforts was an unheard-of procedure in their individualistic industry . <P> Last week the furniture makers were cheerful as buyers placed orders for Kentwood . Although home-building bucked the recession tide , the furniture industry did not . Furniture follows the general business cycle rather than the building cycle , and the automobile has long since displaced it as Public Want No. 2 ( No. 1 is food &; clothing ) . But even in 1938 manufacturers turned out nearly $400,000,000 worth of furniture , double their 1932 volume , and forecasters are cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially cheerful about Kentwood 's prospects . <P> <P> *The nine : Imperial Furniture Co. , Mueller Furniture Co. , Johnson Furniture Co. , Johnson , Handley &; Johnson , Grand Rapids Chair Co. , The Widdicomb Furniture Co. , Ralph Morse Furniture Co. , John Widdicomb Co. , Brower Furniture Co.
