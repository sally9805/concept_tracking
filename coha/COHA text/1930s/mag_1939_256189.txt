The girl watching the dancers was beautiful but pale . Two young men introduced themselves , danced with her . found her hands cold and clammy . They gave her wine , but she spilled it on her white frock . After the dance they started to drive her to an address she gave . At a cemetery she asked to be let out of the car . One of the boys threw his coat over her shoulders , followed her into the graveyard . She vanished , he fell dead . Panic-stricken , the other-boy drove to the address she had given , there learned that the girl had died several months before . On the dead girl 's grave , they found the dead boy 's coat . When they exhumed her , they found a wine stain on her white burial dress . <P> Manhattan Radio Station WMCA by last week had received over 100 excited , fearful , incredulous letters and countless telephone calls asking for more details of this spectral dancer , whose mysterious resurrection they all said had been dramatized grippingly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Five Star Final , the flood of letters was more a mystery than the spook tale . The station had never broadcast the story . <P> Old stuff to newspapers as well as to students of mass psychology , the phenomenon of erroneously attributed wildfire tales like last week 's is fairly new stuff to radio . Re-examination of WMCA 's letters revealed that no correspondent claimed to have heard the broadcast himself . Likeliest solution to the mystery lurked , not on the air waves , but in the files of the Amsterdam News in Harlem , whence thousands of Negroes go daily to gossipy jobs all over the metropolitan area . Not long ago the Amsterdam News reported a similar wraith operating in the neighborhood of Kansas City .
