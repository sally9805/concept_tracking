txt // radiance , like men emerging from a cave into sunlight . But we still have adventure ahead . As yet we have to investigate that crowning invention , the cathoderay tube . That ugly name may conjure up to some people all sorts of nasty technical bogies , but we shall try to rob it of some of its terror . Really the device is quite simple , bared of the maze-like circuits that we find associated with it . Let us picture a glass vessel about the size of a thermos bottle with two plates or electrodes sealed in either end and connected to a vacuum pump . We have connected to the plates or electrodes a source of high-voltage electricity , say 20,000 or 30,000 volts . Inasmuch as about 35,000 volts are required to push a discharge or spark across an inch of space at ordinary atmospheric pressure , nothing will happen when we turn the voltage on in our air-filled tube . The electrons will refuse to budge even with a 35,000-volt kick in the pants . To make them move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying between the electrodes . The sucking pump is set going . Down , down goes the air pressure until a point is reached where a purely insensible amount of air is left in the glass chamber . Now let us turn on the current . Zip , there she goes : a fine , fast-moving stream of pure electrons , electric current in the raw . The little air left in the tube will cause the electron stream to blaze a slightly luminescent path so that we may trace the course taken by our tiny particles . If // we carried the vacuum still higher , the electrons would still be there but we should not be able to see their effects . Down goes the physicist in his bag of tricks . he comes out with a fluorescent paint which , when placed on the inside of the tube , will cause a bright spot to appear where the electron stream im pinges . Now we have something , although still in-complete . Did we not say that electrons being negatively charged particles could be attracted by positive charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us place two more metal plates in the tube , then , in such a way that the electron beam will have to pass between them . Now we place a positive charge on one plate , a negative one on the other . Things turn out just as we had expected ; the electron beam shifts or is bent toward the positive plate . The shift is noted on the fluorescent screen . The slightly inhibited action of the material used on this screen permits us to trace the beam 's motion . We know ( or should know , if we entertain any notion of keeping pace with this brave new world of ours ) that an alternating current fluctuates ; dashes back and forth in its circuit many times a second . First the impulse is negative , then positive , alternately . Connecting such a current to the little plates in the cathode-ray tube would permit us to watch the dance of the current . Its picture would appear as a well-defined wave as the electron beam moved under its // changing impulses . Should we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a microphone , the minute variations of the singing or talking voice would become plainly visible . They would not change faster than the ability of the electron beam to follow . Electrons arc practically inertia-less mites while we are slow and somewhat dull . With a pair of magnets added ( electrons are also twisted out of their normal paths by magnetic fields ) we have before us the cathode-ray tube that will trace our television pictures for us . Here is the answer to the age-old yearning to see over a distance . The cathode-ray tube , however , is no one-shot . It is very much a big-shot electronically speaking . So many things may be done by it that we are still trying to compile it list of them . Fortunately , it may be used at the end of a series of vacuum tubes . That permits us to amplify weak currents until they become able to influence the electron beam passing between the guiding plates . Then , if we replace our fluorescent screen with a photographic film , we are able to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University amplify the currents generated by the human mind in its thinking and dreaming state , push them through a recording Einthoven galvanometer and catch them in films . The cathode-ray will turn this trick tomorrow or perhaps this evening . Unless we have an imagination that would have reduced Jules Verne to the level of a half-wit , we // shall never be able to forecast the future of the ray tube . The discovery of life in its essence may be only a matter of measuring and charting the rhythmic beat of electrical disturbances taking place within the body or organism . Through the use of this tube , we are just now beginning to learn things about sound that Helmholtz never dreamed . The following list notes some fields of science , art , and industry that are already beginning to feel the effects of the application of the cathode ray : Table Just what the cathode ray is doing for these fields of work and research forms a nice little bundle of knowledge for some prodigy to master . Ours is a vibrating world and here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhythm . Oscillology we shall probably be calling it when it reaches its stride , and heaven only knows the nature and breadth of its ultimate gifts to mankind . If we have been attentive readers and have really absorbed what has been said we shall see that science has for the first time prepared a bevy of mechanisms // that offer great promise not only to industry but to the home , the farm , the theater , the hospital and indeed to life taken as a whole , especially in the reduction of labor . We have the elements out of which we may fashion an entirely new form of automatism and in the remaining chapters of this book we shall attempt to assemble these elements in an effort to demonstrate not only that which will be ultimately possible but that which is being accomplished today . Already this new science of mastery over the harnessed forces of nature is filtering down into every crevice of life . The problems before our engineers and researchers relate only to further perfection and application . The foundation that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of cultivation . Even in this comparatively raw state of the art , engineers see new applications faster than they can he accommodated with the time necessary for their adaptation . The engineer 's contributions will be limited only by his imagination . During the past decade we have witnessed brave and bold attempts ? all but fatal in their effects upon the established economic order ? to replace human labor with machine labor . More and more , human hands and muscles have been supplanted with new creations of production . T'he workers who have been able to escape the consequences of such encroachment have in many instances been assigned to supervisory functioning ; mere feeders and operators of switches , levers and buttons . Actual manual labor of the heavy // type has all but disappeared . Now even the machine controller , supervisor or feeder stands in jeopardy of losing his job to a litter of glass tubes . The threat is real enough . No one can gainsay that and , although we promised at the outset to refrain from permitting our discussion to ooze over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder who eventually will be left with money to buy our machine-made ice-boxes , radios and automobiles . The use of robot labor appears to carry with it the seeds of its own destruction unless we can muster the courage to take a realistic view and control things accordingly . The " rugged individualism " of the machine is becoming more dictatorial , and somebody 's claim to the prerogative must suffer . CHAPTER III AND WHOSE LITTLE ROBOT ARE YOU ? THE robot is a willing , unflinching and undiscriminating slave . Ile does not care who owns him or what he does . To him an oiler is more important than a banker and the rascal is becoming so diabolically clever and versatile that he is able to turn his hand to almost any chore . This chapter is going to be a somewhat abbreviated review of a few of the odd jobs lie has taken on to date . To cover the whole field would take far more space than the nature of this book permits . What 's more , complete coverage would turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot has quietly slipped through the doors of at least fifty industries and is now receiving his final instructions and equipment to enter fifty more . The jobs he is doing are legion . With his new brain , his magnetostrictive lingers and his powerful ionic bloodstream , there is really not much left that he can not do . There will come a day when the head of a single human worker will not be seen ranging above an acre of busy , throbbing machinery . In a controltower high above the roaring mass there will sit the 66 // sole master of the hounds of production . On the television screen before him he will inspect each robot in rapid succession by merely flicking a multi-contact switch . Thus will he watch the dial readings of the ultra-micrometers , the thermometers , the densitometers , colorimeters and photometers . His seat will indeed be the seat of the mighty , always providing , of course , that we do not lapse into the dread coma of a sort of industrial feudalism before the robot has a chance really to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an even chance that we shall survive such a catastrophe . Returning to the robot as he is and as he works today , we shall be interested to know that at least a hundred manufacturers are producing electronic robotizing equipment of one sort or another . One of the first little jobs turned over to the photo cell was that of counting . As counters at high speed and over long periods of time , we humans are pretty inefficient . For one thing , we are too slow . Fatigue finally overtakes us and we begin to err . To count accurately and at extra-human speed electrically , we need only to permit the article to be counted to cut through a tiny beam of light that normally strikes a photo cell . Each time this happens , a relay clicks , closes a separate circuit and permits a solenoid to pull down a plunger connected to the arm of a mechanical counter . That 's pie for cell equipment and a neat device to place on a modern assembly line . // Take a pea , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflector of light . Clear it will be that a bad pea , bean or tomato will reflect less light from its damaged surface than a fresh one . From this simple fact , we jump to a long row of sorting photo-cell-thyratron robots with beans trickling through them . When a bad bean comes to the all-seeing eye , the alarm is spread to an electromagnetic " bouncer " that unceremoniously kicks the ostracized offender of bean society into the wastecan . How many girls would be needed to sort a whole car-load of beans in a single day ? Certainly more than we can count on our fingers and toes . The optical robots do the job in an eighthour day . ( Mr canning factories are just beginning to discover the money-saving features of such equipment . The photo cell is a sorter as well as a counter of things . The chances are that the top row of cigars in that fancy Box of Coronas were selected for similarity in shade by a modification of the bean robot . Placed on the spewing end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fling aside those packages that fail to meet the tolerance of neatness . Such electronic inspection is finding wide employment nowadays but it all amounts to menial tasks for something able to accomplish greater things . It is most humiliating indeed . Snaking through every large factory today , we find long conveyor systems with gravity feeds that keep tote-boxes filled with parts flowing through the rouWHOSE // tine of production . Occasionally it becomes necessary to switch a box off the mainline , and prior to the appearance of the photo cell this was quite a problem . Now the dispatcher of a box merely raises a small metal flag on its side . This flag interrupts a beam of light at the junction and the box takes the switch . Much the same trick is used at the mail terminal in Cleveland , Ohio ; mail-bags traveling on special conveyors are routed to their respective cars . These jobs place no strain on the ingenuity of the equipment whatsoever . Wonderful a few years ago ; it 's now routine stuff . Many of the high-production products that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic devices functioning to bring greater speed with a weather-eye cocked on accuracy . What we are going to do finally with the time saved by this speed is a problem that no photo robot can solve although the all-but-insane desire to reduce it is there nevertheless . When we brush our teeth tomorrow morning we can think of an optico-electro robot who watched the crimping of the tube the paste came in . " Not much of a job , " says the robot braggart , " but then these stupid people might give me a chance someday while they are looking for something to do with the time I save them . " Proper and precise registration is a matter of real concern to the mechanical engineer who designs paperbag-making machinery . No tolerance for slippage here // with these bag-making monsters straining to provide us with containers for our cans from the chain groceries . Up pops the electronist . " Pardon me , sir , " he says to the M.E. , " but did I hear you ring for a registering mechanism ? " Result : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peek out at us from unexpected nooks . The automatic telephone is one of the most fearful of the species . Eventually it will release to the streets several hundred thousand telephone operators , thus helping - is to plan our next depression . It was not enough that the business of establishing connections should be done without benefit of human aid . Even the words " The line is busy " have been taken out of the human mouth and placed into a parrot-like robot that repeats them to us when we happen to dial into a closed circuit . The trick is a simple though clever one . Let us visualize a piece of talking moving picture film upon the track of which there has been recorded the phrase referred to above . This film , only a few inches in length , is arranged in a circle which revolves with a photo cell placed at its center . A tiny pencil of light is shot through the sound track and strikes the cell . The pulsations of sound recorded on the film are thus translated into their electrical counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is immediately connected to this robot who conveys to us the proper message . // We have no desire unduly to dramatize these new robots . As yet our feet are on solid ground and not in a theater devoted to a revelation of future wonders . Let 's take the case of Dr. Bush 's Differential Analyzer which is , next to automatic telephony , the crowning achievement of the machine mind . Into one end of this brute mathematician we place a problem . There is a quiet meshing of gears , the sliding of a few levers and , lo and behold , out comes the answer . It is no mere matter of 2 plus 2 equals 4 . That type of arithmetic is left for the calculating machines invented by Pascal centuries ago . From a maze of 13,000 separate parts rolling along on 1,000 ball bearings conies the quick , accurate answer to engineering mathematics that would require days of pencil biting . The answer issues as a curve readily interpreted by the engineer . If we throw a baseball at a speed of 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe ? The machine will tell us and mark with an X the spot where the ball , its energy gone , will fall to earth . Mere child 's play for a brain with this order of magnitude . Let 's try something harder than that even though it is beyond ordinary mathematics . Should we wish to take a trip in a space flyer from Mother Earth to the second moon of Jupiter what would the exact path of the flight look like on paper ? No quick answer will do . The problem , as any astronomer will tell us , is fraught with possibilities of error . The uni72 MACHINES OVER MEN verse is not static ; it is not like planning a trip between New York and Cleveland with a Socony road map spread out before us . The planets move . An astrophysicist would require days to wend his mathematical way through the heavens . Yet the robot can issue a correct trajectory within a short time . Here is roboteering in its essence . Dr. Norman Lehmer is the professor of mathematics at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still another robot solver of problems that are fit to bring brain fever to the mathematical tyro silly enough to attack them . As a test , let us ask for one prime factor for the number 1,537,228,672,093 , - 301,419 . Not wishing to take a year 's leave of absence from our place of employment , we give up . Well , here are two prime factors for the figure mentioned : 529,510,939 and 2,903,110,321 . The dissection was made in the " Congruence Machine " in just three seconds . This dumb finder of prime numbers involves a series of gears of different radii and a photo cell . Much of the counting , sorting and statistical classification involved in the next United States ' census will be handled by a newly contrived battery of electronic brains faster and more accurate than the human brain and quite free from headache and fatigue . Uncle Sam is just like most employers ; he moves the robots in when they are reared to a point where they can bear up under continued application . // The office robot 's future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called brain worker or white-collar slave enjoys no special immunity from attacks of " robot-itis . " On the whole , his future is no more secure than that of his fellow worker in the grime of the shop . He is today threatened by dozens of electronic contraptions not yet emerged from the laboratory . His position is truly alarming . Once the favored fair-haired boy who could not be replaced , he faces an ugly machine future . Now with the cathode-ray voice analyzer to help us catch those elusive differences between " f " and " s , " it will not be long before we have a steno-typer or voice-controlled typewriter that will give the robot-ousted telephone girls plenty of company . The electrically-controlled typewriter operated by a perforated sheet of paper in the manner of the player piano has been here for a number of years . We need only to attach a carefully designed voice-analyzing system to it to make of it a skirtless , unpowdered , unperfumed secretary , dumb but fanatically obedient . Here , too , is surcease for the jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that alarms us . Nothing appears to be safe or free from the threat of revolutionary change . Applecarts that have been jogging along for years are being upset overnight and thousands , nay hundreds of thousands , of wage earners and small industrialists are wringing their hands . There is the matter of geometrical design // as applied to textiles , wallpaper and the like . Surely , we shall be saying , here is something so highly specialized and so dependent upon that kind of human ingenuity closely related to , if not a part of , our inventive capacity , that it should never fear the robot . When we mention geometry , however , the robot pricks up his ears . He knows something about that . The geometrical function is easy , especially in design . Today cathode-ray screen patterns photographed directly from the screen of magnetic deflection tubes turn out to be amazingly attractive from an artistic standpoint . What 's more , infinite variation may be had by various combinations of synchronized deflecting and controlgrid voltages . We can see the textile manufacturer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his electronic " designographer , " scanning the new suggestions that will be forthcoming , one every 15 seconds . By the operation of certain controls , he may create entirely new and original designs . Many daringly new things are developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , which is one of the chief incubators for electronic devices . A smart new robot recently appeared there . He is capable of keeping his nose on a line ; a sort of electronic bloodhound . Offhand , this sounds like a mediocre accomplishment , but a little analysis will show that big things may result from this simple trick of following a line . Mechanical drawings depicting maWHOSE // chine parts are made up of lines . Oh , so we 're going to have a photoelectric reader of blue-prints ? More important than that , we are going to have photoscanners connected to lathes and other cutting machinery that will be capable of directly controlling these machines to produce the physical counterparts of the things outlined on the drawings . Perhaps we shall have to change our methods of drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the same . Fanciful ? By no means . That is the trouble with the lay mind . It can not comprehend the immensity and versatility of the electronic robot . We do not need to look away off into the misty future for the robot-controlled lathe or shaper . We have such things today ; a bit crude yet , to be sure , but nevertheless practical enough to alarm the socially-conscious engineer . A Russian researcher has designed a motormagnet lathe that is actuated by a photo cell scanning a blue-print . The lathe hand is left out . Even his calipers are replaced by electric measuring devices that preserve a very respectable tolerance for error . These lathes are not yet ready for a wholesale invasion of the machine shop but they are being groomed . These robots are getting serious . The Ford Motor Company , like all automobile manufacturers , prides itself on accuracy carried to multi-split hairs . Johansson steel blocks lapped to an accuracy of .0000002 of an inch are the gages used to set and adjust the routine instruments for linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must now be within .0005 of size . So close are some of the limits of tolerance that the ordinary fluctuation of temperature , with resulting expansion and contraction , is a most distressing factor . Speed with accuracy is no small problem . A gage set to .0001 inch is an annoyingly capricious affair . A few contacts with the objects to be measured breed inaccuracy through the slight abrasion incident to application . If we held a wrist-pin in our hand for over twenty-five seconds , the body heat communicated to it in this short time would be sufficient to cause expansion of .0001 inch . I knee the fight on thermal expansion has been as uncompromising as it has been ingenious . One of the problems involved in the application of photo cells had to do with the extraction of the heat from the light beam used . The trick of measuring is a simple one . The part to be measured merely casts its shadow . Excess light is gaged by the photo cell and a red light flashes the signal of rejection . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Passage is limited between .8592 and .85929 . The smart Walter Chrysler has pioneered in this sort of robotized measurement . If extraneous factors like vibration and thermal expansion did not enter , tolerance could be placed at .0000001 inch plus or minus . The machinist 's calipers turn out to be crude // yardsticks by comparison . Electronic rulers are now applied to wire mills where they stand ready to automatically stop a machine when the drawing die falls outside the pale of tolerance . A slow but persistent invasion of the commercial garage is now in evidence . Here the cathode-ray tube , now cheap and reliable , instantly checks distributor heads , batteries , lights and contacting devices . It accomplishes within fifteen minutes what an automotive electrician could not do within two hours . Photo-electric analyzers are butted up to headlights to check glare and intensity . The robot marches on . The textile industry , long hampered by the human element , long buried under acres of slow-moving , costly looms , promises to receive its electronic shotin-the-arm within the next few years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skew . When the cloth passes through the finishing operation it is vitally necessary that the selvage edges are adjusted so that the weft threads are square with the warp threads . Otherwise , the design printed on the material will be noticeably distorted . Heretofore , a human operator with manual controls has sweated to keep the cloth in a condition to receive such impressions . With the cloth speeding by at 40 yards per minute , the task has called for that type of consistent alertness rarely available . By the application of a most ingenious trick , the photo cell has been able to jump into the operator 's shoes . // The threads in the woven cloth passing by the photo cells , one placed on either side of the machine , vary between 280 and 8,4,00 per second depending upon the type of material being printed . These threads interrupt the light reaching the cells and produce a definitely rhythmic current which under ideal conditions should be synchronous ; that is , the current in one cell should have a wave-form exactly the same as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circuit made especially responsive to frequency changes is thrown into operation and a retarding or advancing movement is applied to one side or the other . Neat but not especially gaudy , says the electronic engineer somewhat dryly . But then there are the Lefier and the Korn textile robots . Napoleon decorated Joseph Marie Jacquard for his invention of Jacquard cards , those perforated little pieces of paper that control looms in such a way as to make them weave predetermined designs repetitiously . Now produced by automatic machinery , these cards are still expensive . Inasmuch as a separate card is needed for each thread of weft , a mere 10-inch design may require 800 cards which cost a little more than $100.00 to make . Not so with the Lefler robot . The cost has plummeted to $5.00 . With this surprisingly simple gadget , the most intricate designs may be faithfully duplicated . Merely writing one 's name on a copper plate is sufficient to initiate an action that eventuates in the appearance of // that name woven into cloth with every shade and inflection perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper master and delivers an electronically-amplified current to a series of small electromagnets each of which controls a needle of the loom . Capable of working with three colors with no limitations placed upon intricacy of design , the Lefier loom robot is naturally an ambitious cuss . Korn 's electronic loom robot is a bit less ambidextrous . Korn uses the photo cell to scan designs and directly to transfer these designs to Jacquard cards . There is more than a bare chance that Lefier , with his copper plate , has dealt a deathblow to the card , and that Korn 's device is interesting only in a sort of posthumous way . We have reached that point in our technological advancement where we take most things for granted . On the other hand there are many things that do not receive this left-handed recognition because our contact with them is not sufficiently intimate . How rudely disturbed we should be if one day our telephone , electric , radio , news and water service should suddenly fail us by strike or catastrophe . That water chemist working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from having a dangerous case of dysentery . Our happiness , our luxury and well-being rests on a million shoulders . Tomorrow it may rest instead upon a few light-inspired electrons leaving the sodium surface of a photo cell . The lady // with the mink coat strutting down Fifth Avenue with torso encased in pure silk certainly does not feel obligated in any sense to the still-obscure phenomenon referred to above . Yet the chances are that the very threads in the stockings on her shop-weary legs were photo-metered . Silk from the Orient , fast-fading competitor of the rayon-spouting capillary tube , does not have a uniform thread . Silkworms are not commercially conscious . The famous silk-minded Cheney Brothers were first with a device called the Seriplane that made it easy to inspect threads to increase uniformity . The Seriplane was nothing but a block upon which the threads were wound about a hundred to the inch . Inspected with light , the course and fine threads were easily detected , less easily separated and graded . Human eyes have been replaced with photo cells connected to curve-drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a slave to accuracy . More and more our industrial problems are resolving themselves into ingenuity , perseverance , mathematics and electron tubes . The people of New York City travel thousands of vertical miles each clay in its elevators . Rigid inspection of equipment under a tight city ordinance has made the elevator accident a rarity . Still rarer will it become when photo cells jump into the breach . Carelessness in operating doors has brought a number of injuries , as has poor leveling of the car . The 116 photo cells , 58 amplifier and 58 rectifier tubes on the // elevators of Rockefeller Center have eliminated such things . Elevator doors can not be closed while a beam of light remains obstructed and cells tucked away under floors making leveling mandatory . The painter and . the decorator have not been overlooked in the gifts of electronics . An electronically . operated gage now measures the precise thickness of an application while colorimeters at the paint factory keep shades matched with **29;820;TOOLONG accuracy . Noteworthy , too , is the new robotcontrolled paint-spraying machinery that saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of wet articles coming from the spraying cabinets . Our automobiles have fenders so counted and doors that have been measured for sound transmission with cathode-ray tubes . The robot is no longer marching on ; he is running . Tomorrow , without doubt , a photoelectric speed trap will supply unassailable evidence of our guilt in defying local speed laws . Any discussion devoted to the accomplishments of modern robotry must perforce take on a rhapsodical air . The narrator is confronted with the task of establishing a decent continuity while concerned with material poles apart . For example , one would not think that a robot useful to a painter or a manufacturer of silk would turn up at the business-end of a telescope trained on some variable star of the third magnitude . Yet such things happen daily . An autographic record could be kept of such a star while the astronomer // slumbered . To please the gourmet with uniformlyroasted coffee beans , Chase and Sanborn have now placed in operation photo inspectors for their product . Definite color means definite flavor . The photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not detect a difference of 15 seconds in roasting time . The cell goes to 71/2 seconds . The doctor , the baker and the candlestick maker , all are coming to the robot which , incidentally , is not necessarily photo-electric or even electronic . He takes many forms . We place great emphasis on the electronic form as the ultimate triumph . At the present time he is but receiving a course of training and a very preliminary one at that . He has already been endowed with a very respectable set of senses , in some instances more alert and far more acute than our own . He can " smell " the noxious , toxic odor of mercury vapor long before a human could detect its dangerous presence . This the photo cell made especially responsive to short-wave ultra-violet light accomplishes . If we opened a bottle of mercury and placed it under the " nose " of this mechanism , it would respond in less than a second . Lacking sensitivity in the violet end of the spectrum , we should fail to see mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife . " The need for uniformity presents itself in many and widely-separated industries . Should the paper of a cigarette be too thick , the end-products of combusWHOSE // Lion would give a most unpalatable smoke . To guard against this error , Chesterfield now employs only photo-cell-certified paper , the opacity of which is continuously checked by an optical robot as the web enters the cigarette-making machine . Surely the casual smoker is serenely unaware of such watching over the butt that dangles from his lips . Anything having to do with light is a made-to-order job for photo-electric equipment . Hence we should not be surprised to find it making its way in photography . The lightmeter was first used by the electricbulb manufacturers when they found a new way of eliminating the old Bunsen photometer . Then the illuminating engineers began to carry little lightmeters with them to measure the light in the far corners of living rooms and public auditoria . It was great fun because this was the first time they had an accurate check on their all-too-easily-fooled eye . One day the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he would give the gadget a try-out .

Einstein has invented a camera which might easily be the forerunner of such a dream . Let us hope that we shall at least preserve ambition enough to press the button . In the matter of developing pictures , some of the more advanced scien84 MACHINES OVER MEN tific photographers are now receiving invaluable data from photo-electric integrators that give them density in terms of exposure to light . Purely mechanical machinery has been carried a long way toward increased sensitivity , but here definite limits are pretty well set . As an instance , the machines that wrap bread with waxed paper could not be expected to keep the trade-mark properly located in respect to each loaf . Creeping error would eventually destroy any initial accuracy . The designers finally had to come to the electronic engineer who immediately diagnosed the case as one calling for the electric eye . Such machines were greatly speeded up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the smartest contraptions that has yet fallen out of the electronic cornucopia came from England . It is covered by British Patent No. 424,802 , and was perfected by J. Dorn , C. E. Duits and A. Gore . Let us imagine that a translucent wax form in , say , the shape of a tenpin , is being revolved on its axis before a photo cell . The form must proceed in a movement parallel to its axis throughout its entire length so that a beam of light impinging on the cell will have the opportunity of passing through all of it at exact center . Now it will be clear to us that maximum light will reach the cell when the light is passing through the head of the pin . Minimum value will be reached when the bellied part of the pin is traversed by the beam . // We now have the wherewithal to translate this fluctuating beam of light into corresponding mechanical motion . The point should be clear . With a wax or glass master placed in a scanning machine , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to duplicate the master . Accuracy is but a matter of routine research . Here is something for our wood and metal cutters to watch . This principle permits considerable latitude . Replace the cutting machine with a device bearing a rapidly whirling piece of very plastic material contacted by a " modulating tool " and we have a method of conveying the illusion of solid forms by radio . Properly sensitized and perfected we have , still more wonderful , a device for " feeling " at a distance . Again we are reminded that Jules Verne was an unimaginative prophet . We caught up with his vaporings years ago . When Dr. John Watson thumped tin pans behind the backs of year-old infants as a part of his experiments in behaviorism , little did he dream that photo cells , then just emerging from the laboratory , would one day play a part in his work . Professor W. T. Heron of the University of Minnesota made a maze for rats in an effort to investigate their habits and inhibitions .

The mild , shockless current that passed through their bodies was amplified by a radio tube and used to close a relay . After a relay is closed , heavy current will flow , and then most anything may happen . In this case , the current flowed through a series of magnets that controlled a story-telling typewriter that the learned professor consulted at day 's encl . Fertile is the scheming mind of Homo sapiens when there is time or labor at the focal point of his attention . The electronist is creating mechanisms almost faster than he can find suitable names for them . On the whole , however , he is not only a fair lexicographer himself but he is bringing sleepless nights to the professionals in their effort to keep up with him . A new instrument for testing the hardness of water has been dubbed a Hardimeter . A so-called " memory robot " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the latter , the gray matter of the brain is replaced by aluminum foil that stores away electrical " images " for future use . This in an effort to prove that human thoughts assume and hold definite electric patterns , a theory that is fast hardening into incontrovertible fact . After all , a phonograph " remembers " what has been said to it . The camera , too , " remembers " what it sees . Farther back , we referred with considerable conviction to the possibility of the voice-controlled typewriter . We had a right to . Years ago Professor ShelWHOSE // don of New York University displayed a toy train that would start , stop and obediently reverse itself when spoken to over a microphone . The electronist today exercises a most satisfactory control over the wave-form of human speech after it is converted into pulsating electric currents . He can invert it , literally turn it upside down ; he can delay it ; make Tibhett sound like a dramatic soprano . A manufacturer of large pipe-line valves at the New York machinery show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the soft utterance of those words in a microphone . The beginning , much less the end , of voice-operated contrivances has not been seen . If you have been attentive , you have perhaps noticed the repetition of the words magnets and magnetic in this discussion . Through the agency of the electromagnet we are able to convert electric current into direct mechanical action , a most important function in roboteering . It is natural that engineers have tried to make magnets more powerful so that they may take on heavier mechanical work . We must have small magnets that will lift more weight . By mixing nickel and aluminum with steel ( called Alnico ) we have succeeded in tremendously increasing the power of coil-less permanent magnets of the horseshoe type ; but progress with the electromagnet has been slower . For this current-activated magnet , we need to concentrate many amperes of current flow into a small space to get a real kick . Large lifting magnets will pick up // five tons in a junkyard but here current consumption and size vs. lifting power are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a magnet that can be held in the hand , the poor mechanical engineer will receive another severe jolt from his electrical brotherhood . Here will be a new and revolutionary means of imparting motion . Dr. Francis Bitter of M.I.T. has produced a magnet rated 150,000 times greater than the earth 's magnetic field , but the heat it generates needs to be baled away by flowing water and the device requires enough current to light a small city . Perchance , the answer to generating greater magnetic power will lie in permitting charged condensers to discharge through suitable coils . That may have all of the earmarks of a makeshift , yet Nall , an Englishman , has been able by this method to generate magnetic fields so powerful that they ruptured the coils that gave them birth . The growers of California are a smart lot with their neatly-contrived merchandising methods and their rubber-stamped oranges , lemons and walnuts . A recent work will permit them to be still smarter in providing the public with uniform taste and freedom from damaged fruit so often difficult to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly different electrical resistance than does fresher fruit . This slight difference in conductivity may be used to operate a critically-adjusted relay in such a manner that unfit fruit properly contacted with electrodes will // be ejected from a conveyor line by suitable mechanism . In the field of war the robot still has to make his mark , although the writers in the Sunday supplements would have us believe that the next war will be largely a matter of who is first to bomb large centers of population with T.V.T. and poison gas dispensed from radio-controlled airplanes . There is no question about the radio-controlled planes ; they are here although not yet in a perfected form that would be reliable with such absent manipulation . Just how the bombs would be aimed is not explained by our fantastic writers . Heaven only knows , the methods of war are diabolical enough without such mechanisms , and yet we may rest assured that should the race persist in this insane competition for mass destruction , sweet contemporary of mass production , the leering robot will eventually stir himself and lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the task placed before him . John Hays Hammond , Jr. , has been devoting himself for years to the perfection of robot actuated and guided engines of war , especially in naval armaments . A recent patent issued to him covers a marine torpedo that , dog-like , would retrace its steps in case it missed its quarry . A magnetic needle pulled by the metal mass of the ship is the secret . Here the actualities of war are usually so far removed from ordinary func90 MACHINES OVER MEN tioning as to make such schemes more practical in the minds of their inventors than they are in service . Anything that moves may be counted by electronic mechanism . Speed , regardless of degree , is not a factor . The Geiger automatic counters we now set up in different parts of the world announce and count the cosmic-ray particles reaching the earth at speeds of thousands of miles per second . Photo-electric modifications of the same equipment may count beans , horses , automobiles or sheep . No longer is it necessary for a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical counter to chart the flow of cars . A photo-counter is much more adept at such a job and it does it cheaply without time out for lunch . Grid-glow tubes attached to road pads may also actuate traffic lights on intersections . The dairyman may he interested in the future of the electronic robot on two scores . The Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers College showed how it could grade milk and how high-powered oscillating tubes may set up lethal sound-waves that will coagulate the red corpuscles of frogs or strike dead the millions of organisms that swarm in the freshest milk . If the human race persists in its time-honored habit of sucking at a cow 's udder it is high time we made a better , quicker job of making the liquid fit to drink in the shortest , surest way possible without resorting to Pasteur 's rather cumbersome process . It 's an Olympian jump from milk to the high walls // of Sing Sing prison , but if we are to continue with our armchair exploration , that is precisely where we land . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall but we do propose to permit such a rash act to set off alarms . A photo-cell relay system of this type was recently tested by the alert Warden Lawes and it received his whole-hearted endorsement . The average thug will find himself a poor match for this sort of watchman . When the regents ' board of the State of Alabama examined the papers of certain school children in Tuscumbia a short time ago , it was surprised to find a 20 per cent reduction in the number of failures . Our educators have long since known that from 8 per cent to 15 per cent of our children acquire defective vision during the first few years of school life . On the whole , this has resulted from nothing but a pitiful disregard for proper illumination and its intelligent employment . In the case under discussion , the children involved were first given standard Otis intelligence tests , half of those of the same rating being placed in one room , half in another . One test room had photo-cell-controlled lights that would be automatically turned on when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , the artificial lights in the cell-controlled system burned 34.1 per cent of the school hours to maintain 12 foot-candles on the 3 rows of desks farthest from the windows . Out of 36 pupils in // the photo-cell room only 4 flunked , while out of 32 in the other room 11 flunked . Coincidence ? Perhaps , yet the inference points strongly to the benefits of scientific control . We may still have homes where photo cells will turn on our lights whether we think it necessary or not . The privately-owned public utilities will like that , if they live to see it . Teletouch is another new word for the lexicographer to ponder over . We may recall enough of our Latin to recognize that it means touching over a distance . We have previously mentioned electronic controls set off by the mere presence of a body or a hand operating through the agency of a disturbed capacity between separated electrodes . Hence , if we approach a store window in the future and watch an animated advertising gadget we shall know that our intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocentappearing mirror into which we shall see reflected the denticulated smile of a young housewife fresh from afternoon bridge pouring out a can of Heinz 's beans for a husband who expected steak or chops . No , the advertising man is not on the narrowing list of people in business who can afford to ignore the robot . A single cicada can set millions of tons of air vibrating . We can disturb air much more efficiently than we can detect it after it has been disturbed . Electronic robots are excellent detectors of sound , being able to amplify the private world of a corn weevil // inside a kernel until it would split the ear-drums . Several large trumpets pointed skyward with their small ends fastened to microphones may ferret out approaching airplanes while they are miles away . Photo cells may function here , too , ringing alarms long before our eyes can see the tiny specks in the sky . Using a modification of the trumpet amplifier , the U. S. Geodetic Survey explodes T.N.T . bombs in the sea at a known position and depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of sound to the surface hydrophones ( submerged microphones ) , where the minutely vibrating current is amplified and caused to make its marks on a moving tape . The rest is easy , a mere matter of scratchpad and pencil . We could go on well into the wee small hours with this story of the electronic robot as he affects the productive capacity of men and machines ; but time and tide compel us to leave out of this modest treatment many examples of the yeoman service he is performing in a multitude of unexpected places . The soaking-pit covers , the cut-off tables in the sheet and rod mills of the steel industry are rapidly being tamed to the gentle touch of a beam of light . Bakers save Melba toast and bread , paper makers save paper , and game wardens keep animals in preserves by photo-controlled gates . // As a parting shot , and to convince the skeptic , we append a by-no-means-complete list of the functions being performed today by the sort of electronic mechanisms we have been discussing . Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe from the threat of the robot , " we shall be saying . But is it ? We can not be sure . After all , the doctor in much of his work is a glorified mechanic called upon to adjust and mend the various levers and universal joints of the human body . In these repairs , lie applies purely mechanical principles and is aided by purely mechanical tools . A well-equipped physician 's office may boast a set of gadgets totaling at least 150 pounds in weight . The service man in the garage also has a set of tools that probably does not exceed this figure . The physician is not only a mechanic but all electrician as well . He started reading the dials of the milli-ammeter some years ago . More and more , he is finding the human machine to be a vast and complicated network built to generate and accommodate a constant shuffling and redistribution of electrons . We certainly can not be so sure of the medicos ' lasting independence when we know that even in the present state of knowledge we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robotized X-ray machine , that will ring a bell 106 // when a patient standing before it reveals an incipient malignancy . Ordinarily we do not associate the medicos with the robot because of a long-standing respect for these fellows . The position of the doctors in society is unique and they enjoy a sort of pontifical infallibility that is not always merited . Certainly some of the concoctions in the pharmacopoeia could well be dispensed with without great danger of increasing the death rate . And many of the remedies listed call for the blind faith of both patient and prescriber . There is a lingering belief in magic , that heritage of respect for the mystical and unknown . The patient is a blind and gullible receiver of the rite , and the physician as often as not is a priest-like giver of the potion . He might easily spend a lifetime in research without discovering the ultimate effects of the drug he offers so freely . What are the end-products of some of these magic powders and gallish liquids after they become involved in the magnificently complicated chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet we must realize that we can not disturb normal functioning without leaving a mark somewhere . Conceivably it might take the body weeks to rid itself of the organic poisoning produced by a single aspirin tablet and we might never be the same for having taken it . The status of the painkiller in its relation to // the chemistry and the electricity of the human engine is yet to be exposed . For one thing , we of the laity accept explanations too freely . We are too apt to be moved by mere respect for words we do not understand . We tend to worship phraseology adorned with technical terms . Homo sapiens always has a little incense in his pocket which he likes to burn in the shrines of the unknowable . Our diatribe must not be looked upon as a general indictment of medicine or surgery . God knows , we have had thousands of sincere research workers who have given their all that we might find balms for nature in her more brutal moods . Pasteur may not have possessed Lindbergh 's glamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest mountains of intellect that has yet emerged from the endless lowlands of human understanding . On the whole , we have little right to attack the pure researcher . Unless he has a mind prostituted by a too-commercially-minded employer , his motives are sincere and laudable enough even though he may miss his marks more often than he hits them . It is only when his findings reach the outside world that we have a right to question the ethics involved in their exploitation . Not long ago , the author of this treatise sought the advice of a physician living in a large city . He was prominent and successful beyond the wildest dreams of the interne . His wife was a social leader and his // income was reputed to be $75,000 per year . He was personable and a good business man , although among his brother practitioners he enjoyed no special rating . When the author entered his office , large , airy and well-appointed , thirty-two patients had preceded him . The three-hundred-dollar grandfather clock in the corner struck 8:00 . By 9:45 , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their prescriptions , pink pills and liquors . It might have been a magnificent performance had the scientific training of this man matched his keen sense for trade . Judged by ethical standards his performance was an outrage . It violated every ideal of the profession . Assuredly , some of these people were genuinely sick , perhaps almost unto death . Hours , even days , of observation would have been necessary for a sincere examination and a solidly-formulated diagnosis of their troubles . Here was rank commercialism . The author left the office without visiting the inner sanctum . The next day he sought the services of a man of world renown in his field . This man 's position had not been measured by his bank account , his cars , or membership in a number of clubs . There was no hint of impatience , no demand for speed . This craftsman sat before his patients with pencil and paper writing the answers given to pertinent questions . He had a terrific respect for the human machine and a humble attitude in approaching its problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jus110 MACHINES OVER MEN tify certain definite conclusions . In the case cited , this man finally confessed openly and freely his inability to define the trouble . It was the best news the author had yet had , a sincere opinion based on mature scientific examination , and it was worth a crateful of pellets . By a cautious process of elimination , it provided a starting point . A doctor can abuse his privileges and the immunity that an admiring society has set up for him . He works in a special and well-protected little world all of his own where he may hide his mistakes , pad his bills and indulge in practises that would land less protected citizens in jail . He may choose between being a great benefactor or a thief in the night without fear of punishment . His conscience is his only guide , and it is fortunate that the integrity of the medical *profession is high . What is needed is a more automatic and surer method of diagnosis divorced as far as possible from human interpretation . We want more dial-reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and involves such a subtlety of ethical appraisal . But can we have any such form of diagnosis ? Can we robotize such delicate functioning ? Can we make of medicine a slot-machine profession by eliminating error and reducing treatment as well to automata ? We most assuredly can not unless we have an infantile belief in miracles . We can , however , partially roboTHE // tize medicine and surgery by the automatic measure ment of certain small effects that may provide proper diagnosis read from a chart or dial . After all , we have only recently arrived at a point where we have instruments versatile and sensitive enough to yield information that has long since been denied . To make an intelligent approach to the subject , we of the laity must change our attitude toward the hu man machine . Instead of regarding it as an embodi ment of mechanical and chemical parts we must look upon it as being essentially an electrical phenomenon . Looked at broadly from the viewpoint offered by the electron theory of matter , chemistry , as the chemists have discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrically-constituted atoms of the elements . Billions of these unattached electrons roam the human engine in the form of elec tric currents , and we are just beginning to measure them and to assign to them certain definite functions . Only yesterday did the biochemist find himself stand ing on a new promontory gazing out over vast and far-flung green fields under the surface of which the very secrets of life may lie . Standing beside him , he finds the bio-electrician with his pH cells , vacuum tubes , micro-voltmeters and photo cells . War has been de clared on biological ignorance , and the generals are mobilizing their troops of instruments . For years we have been almost innately conscious of the part that electricity plays in the life process . // Now we are quite sure that all phenomena are essentially electrical . We could list dozens of current sources in the human system ; the heart , the muscles , the cells , and the brain act as generators . Indeed it is quite impossible for the human machine to function at all without converting part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago we had no measuring instruments that could catch and record the more delicate currents that are constantly passing over the highways and byways of the human system . After all , some of them were so minute as to involve only a few million electrons , and the electron is a rather inconsequential affair as we have previously discovered . We now have to help us the vacuum-tube micro-voltmeter which is capable of measuring minute d-c potentials in living organisms . Although a number of micro-voltmeters are now in use throughout the United States , the most exciting news regarding them comes from Yale University . Here Professor Harold S. Burr and his associates in the Medical School connect these supersensitive indicators to both healthy living tissue and dying tissue . Strange things have been observed ; the organisms appear to flash an electric signal when they are approaching or even on the way to eternity . There is a distinct change , for instance , in the electrical potential of prediseased tissue which indicates cancer in mice antecedent to its actual appearance . Nature seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host . Curious also is the discovery that ovulation in rabbits may be detected instantly by a change in the electrical potential of the tissues involved . The tiny electron is present at the moment of conception ; life in its very beginning joins hands with electricty . Or is life merely a phase of electricity ? The same tubes that trip shears in the steel mills are beginning to catch those elusive streams of negative particles surging through the cells of living organisms . The animal eye is essentially photo-electric ; it converts the quanta of light received into electric energy that is flashed to the brain there to leave its message . Vacuum-tube amplifiers connected to the eye of an anesthetized frog have shown this . What is more , the current generated has been found to depend upon the wave-length of the light striking the retina , each color giving a definite current response . It appears that we can not flick an eyelid , move a finger or even think unless we disturb a large number of electrons and cause them to marshal themselves into streams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has broadcast by radio the effects of the current generated in the jaw muscles of a young man munching cake . In the past , we have been inclined to look upon the animal body as a vastly complicated chemical vat . The chances are distinctly in favor of our having to change that view . Perhaps a // new type of searcher must enter the picture , the bioelectro-chemist . That the animal organism may generate current is not a new idea . The fish Gymnotus electricus was found long ago to be able to deliver a shock in excess of that supplied by the penny arcade machine . Its 700 volts may stun a horse , light a neon sign or even kill smaller fish . Dr. George Crile looks upon the human brain as a mass of some 4 quadrillion electric cells capable of generating electron flows . The merest thought stirs the invisible hordes . Professor C. Judson Herrick , of the University of Chicago , has said that the interconnecting lines of force that lash one brain cell to another may he represented by the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly ex , , citing calculation that makes the **31;851;TOOLONG star rather dull and prosaic by comparison . Can we imagine a figure so gigantic as to fill 30 books each of 350 pages ? And this has to do only with the cerebral cortex . Professor Willem De Sitter 's figure of **34;884;TOOLONG , 000,000,000 , - **43;920;TOOLONG , - 000 protons for the mass of the entire universe is a mere mathematical pigmy . The astronomical megaparsec ( a parsec is 19.2 trillion miles ) turns out to be a small figure indeed . The 14 billion cells of the cortex alone are each in anatomical relationship with a hundred others . If the contemplation of creation should bring Homo // sapiens to his knees in worship , surely the human brain should inspire equal wonder . The swarms of cells are by no means haphazardly arranged . They are systematically patterned . Here is the ultimate design for living . Little wonder that the attending physician sagely strokes his chin over the little child who has suffered a fracture of the skull in an automobile accident . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Nature may permit the removal of an arm , a leg or a gall-bladder but here she brooks no interference . Our chief concern at the moment is to review the work that has been done in measuring brain currents . Some sixty scientists are now searching the vastness of the cortex in an effort to discover some sort of correlation between the anatomical , the physiological and the rhythmic current-patterns already discovered . In view of the maddening complexity of the human mind , our position may be something like that of an ant hacking away at one of the pyramids , but we are brave nonetheless . And then , on the other hand , it may be that this electrical prospecting in the brain will unearth a gold nugget or two that will help us in our perennial war with disease both mental and pathological . Fleischle von Marxow began this brain probing in a serious way as far back as 1890 . He was a capable experimenter but he had to work with picks and shovels , relatively speaking . There were no vacuum tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his apparatus as a whole was lamentably crude . With it , nevertheless , he was able to discover faint electrical impulses surging through the skulls of animals . It was not until Hans Berger , of the University of Jena , picked up the threads where von Marxow left off that things began to hum . That was in 1930 . Berger had a vastly improved method and he placed his currentcollecting electrodes directly in the brains of his anesthetized subjects . The recording instrument , a special form of Einthoven oscillograph , began to flash out interesting messages . There was what Berger called the rhythmic Beta current with 20 or more pulsations a second and the Alpha current with 10 pulsations . These were the normal , day-to-day , electrical patterns . Berger made no attempt to decipher them . It was too early even to generalize . Outstanding among the sixty brain-current experts referred to above is 1 ) r . Louis W. Max at New York University . Especially interesting have been his observations in connection with deaf mutes . He finds , strangely enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the exact counterparts of the currents in the brain , even though the hands are not moving . This is not so with normal people . Although they are in no sense conclusive , his experiments tend to show that the brain may not be the seat of thought . We may think with the whole organism . If we do , it is about time that we found it out . // Apparently there is a vast difference , electrically , between the thinking mind and the dreaming mind . With Max 's apparatus , we may watch a subject pass off into slumber ; first there is the erratic vibration of the quartz string in the Einthoven machine and then the final period of quietude when the weary brain settles to rest . It remains electrically active but there is a more orderly rhythmic fluctuation to the current . A dream may break up this orderly possession and introduce a new series of wiggling wave-patterns that will last as long as 2 to 2 ? minutes . Today it may be said with assurance that the human or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the heart was the sole performer of this kind . When we close our eyes and relax , our brain will " beat " 8 to 20 times a second . More wonderful still , it generates a current ranging from 10 millionths to 50 millionths of a volt each time it heaves . Carried to proper amplifiers and a recording Einthoven oscillograph , this current may be recorded as a tiny wave penciled with a beam of light on a moving photographic film . Here for the first time the human mind leaves its record in black and white . Drs . Hallowell Davis and Frederick A. Gibbs of the Harvard Medical School are , with Dr. Max and others , doing a bit of electrical prospecting in the last outpost of science lying in the never-never land of the organic engine . On their tape , sleep is indicated by a slow // wave of five to the second in place of a smaller , shorter one that skips along at a much higher rate . This is all very fascinating and curious we might say , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Simply this : Perhaps we have here in an embryonic and crude form the perfect instrument for diagnosis , the robot with his fingers not on the pulse of the beating heart hut on the pulse of the beating brain . It may well be that each pain surges through the brain as a series of waves the frequency of which determines their origin . Indigestion may be recognized by one frequency , poliomyelitis by another . This may amount to speculation , lit speculation of this sort is just another expression of that penetrating imagination to which the world owes most of its discoveries . In view of recent work done with the application of high-frequency radio waves , the suggestion looms up as having a great deal of significance . At the West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh it was found that the disease , furunculosis , could be effectively treated only by a certain definite frequency . There is a bare chance that each human ailment sets up a definite pattern and that in our treatments we must apply a wave or current having a definite mathematical relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the probing of the brain , we have a means of charting these " disease patterns " if they exist , and with our radiotherapeutic equipment we have a means of generating a wide range of wave-energy antidotes. // We might mention still another experiment that would tend to fortify our position , arbitrary as it may seem . To date , medical science has been able to offer little help to the epileptic . Bromide depressants are given , only helping to bridge a dangerous gap ; they do not cure . Now it so happens that the brain of the epileptic is a very special kind of broadcaster at the moment preceding a fit or convulsion . Large , abnormal electrical surges , 3 to the second , pass through the brain and produce 100 to 300 millionths of a volt each . Connected to such stormy brains , the little beam of light on the recording oscillographs dances a violent jig . A thunder-storm rages in the brain . When the depths of the fit have been reached , the rhythm is slow and symmetrical . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , such uncontrollable deflection from the norm of conduct , has not been found . Should it be possible to isolate it and should it be discovered that it involved a part that could be dispensed with , a modern brain surgeon might remove it . Already we know that wherever the disturbance may lie , it gives off electrical energy 3000 per cent above the normal flow . New facts , new figures , new theories are flashed at us from many laboratories devoted to brain-wave work . From Harvard come the startling results of an experiment that had to do with a monkey who was given a brain bath of electricity . Professor E. L. Chaffee and Dr. Richard U. Light were the electricians. // Imbedding a small coil of wire next to the monkey 's skull and anchoring its terminals deep in the tissue of the brain , these ingenious workers were able by this means to flood the monkey 's brain with induced electric current . Such current , when made alternating in nature , may be induced from one coil to another even though such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavorted in a cage surrounded by large loops of excited wire . When current flowed in these wires , a current also flowed into the primate 's brain . The control was perfect . Any frequency could be applied to the brain by simply changing the frequency of the current flowing in the outer coils . This experiment may eventuate in a valuable check on the technique used in brain surgery by locating definitely the motor and sensory tissues . In the experiment mentioned , muscular tremors and other forms of motor reaction were produced along with forms of epilepsis . Stimulation of the hypothalamus region of the brain brought sleep . Any adding up of these results of brain work may be premature as yet but we are sorely tempted to promulgate a theory from the seemingly rational pieces of the puzzle that now lie about and that appear to fit one into the other . Of course , we must not permit our enthusiasm to run away with our judgment but at least we shall not be surprised if one day we have presented to us a sound theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living organisms . // When that day comes , medical diagnosis will be revolutionized . Today a good diagnostician is right half the time . Tomorrow , he may be right practically all of the time . When any electric current or , perhaps more accurately , any flow of electrons takes place within wires or other conducting mediums , electric strains and magnetic fields are set up in the surrounding space . By the use of simple apparatus we may detect such disturbances and reconvert them back into electron flows in circuits quite independent of those carrying the original current . Such is the theory back of radio . The weaker the original exciting medium , the smaller the resulting electrostatic and electromagnetic waves in space . Once more we are presented with the opportunity of doing a bit of delicious speculating . At Duke University , experiments in telepathy have shown that the laws of averages and probability do not account for the astonishing ability of some people to guess the characters on cards not present to the senses . Dare we be so bold as to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up electromagnetic waves in space and that each human is capable of receiving such waves ? While not essentially associated with robotry , we feel we have the right to indulge in such speculation for a moment , inasmuch as the elements needed for an argument are so handy . The harder we think , Dr. Max at New York Univer122 MACHINES OVER MEN sity shows , the more current we generate . Morons concentrate a great deal of energy on their thinking and hence give strong records on the Einthoven oscillographs when their aching brains are confronted with tough problems . In the intelligent man , thought patterns invariably show less amplitude although the waves that come with a problem like 3 times 27 are not nearly so large as those associated with the square root of .8272 . Fascinating though it is , we shall have to leave this subject of the brain and its associated electrical phenomena to consider other developments that may help to bring a greater degree of robotry to medicine and surgery . In a sense , the X-ray machine is a robot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the final stage of robotry at an early date . Insofar as its purely automatic features are concerned , it has already attained a high degree of independent automatic action both as regards intensity and length of exposure . In such functions , the roentgenologist is reduced to a mere dial setter and meter reader . On the whole , however , the ray machine has many shortcomings . For one thing , it can not see around a rib or a pelvic bone , any bone for that matter . As often as not , what the doctor wants to look at is neatly hidden behind some bony structure and although photographing at different angles has overcome much of this difficulty , it has not in any sense reduced it to a negligible factor . // To eliminate such shortcomings , Jean Kieffer of the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Hospital , uses an Xray machine in which during exposure the film moves in one direction and the tube in the opposite . This turns out to be a neat trick , permitting a photograph or view in one plane only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the tube and the object to be viewed . Never , except in major operations and post-mortem dissection , have the medicos been accorded such fine views of internal organs as Kieffer has been able to provide . The Germans , too , have a stereoscopic X-ray machine called the tomograph . They have produced a picture of the lungs without including the jail-like bars of the ribs . Truly , the X-ray robot is just beginning to stir himself . He has grown big indeed but hitherto has been pretty much of a moron , too lazy to move about much or do any worthwhile thinking in his own right . And speaking of size , no less than 1,000,000 volts now surge through his inwards to produce rays so lethal that a few moments next to the tube would bring death . Patients to be treated by such Gamma ray beams ride on rails in a lead-lined room that creeps toward the tube eventually to be showered in a form of invisible radiation that replaces as much as $75,000,000 worth of radium . Radium , we shall recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scientific Front , if we may indulge in the social terms of the day , is advancing over a wide terrain . In124 MACHINES OVER MEN cessant reading is necessary to keep abreast of the reports it sends to the base lines , and at that the less publicized movements are often the most significant . As one example , the ordinary reader of pseudo-science is probably unaware of the experiment that imparts to ordinary table salt or sodium chloride , as the chemist calls it , a most bountiful supply of radium emanation . We can not be called visionary for daring to predict the day when we may buy a few cents ' worth of radioactive table salt at the local drugstore , said salt to be swallowed for an internal bath in this invisible radiation . Professor Ernest 0 . Lawrence brings this new wonder about by storming the citadel of the atom 0f matter with the neutron ( union of one proton and one electron ) flung at terrific speeds from his robot-like atom smasher called the cyclotron or electrical merry-goround . The neutron is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used by the atom wreckers as a sledge hammer . When copper , for instance , is bombarded by billions of neutrons , it becomes " ill " and begins to vomit forth radiations and particles similar to those flung off by radium in its mad , 1,500-year moment of suicide . It is no exaggeration to say that such bombardment may one day be used to manufacture artificial radium on a massproduction basis . There is really little reason to believe that we shall have to continue our frantic search for the natural element when it can be factory made . // Compared with the small amount of radium that we now sweat out of several hundred tons of ore , the Lawrence machine , although in its infancy , produces a sizable amount at much lower cost . The Carrel-Lindbergh heart-lung device has , if nothing else , brought lurid predictions from the Sunday feature writers . This was something they could sink their teeth into in a big way . It is no reflection on the machine to say that in its record as a space filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came from England back in the 1920 's . Alexis Carrel , however , is no maker of hoaxes . He is dead serious and a profound worker . Lindbergh , it appears , merely provided a robotized function for the circulation of the fluids contained in the heartlung mechanism . Carrel had previously outlined the essential conditions for this living heart . Crude as the robot was when compared to the appallingly complicated organisms it was called upon to replace , it did its allotted work with amazing efficiency . It permitted an organ to be clipped from an animal body and kept alive for days in a sterile glass vessel . Quasinatural conditions were maintained by the robot , who saw to it that the tissue received , with a rhythmic throbbing , the manna of life in the form of blood serum or growth-stimulating solutions in the presence of oxygen , carbon dioxide and nitrogen . Carefully were these vital elements guarded against an invasion of death-dealing micro-organisms . Ova126 MACHINES OVER MEN ries , thyroids , suprarenals , spleens and hearts and kidneys of fowl were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Carrel . These things not only lived but grew ; formed new tissue and cells . The disengaged organ searching for a body had arrived . A number of years before Carrel made his experiments , Pavlov , the late Russian master of the conditioned reflex , had kept the severed head of a dog alive and , dog-like , still interested in food . He , too , had a mechanical heart and a borrowed bloodstream . A robot manned a pump to keep this decapitated head functioning . Are we building up to the introduction of a man or woman with a robot heart ? Heavens , no . No such monkeyshine motivated either Carrel or Pavlov . They were simply looking about for the discovery of life processes , the nerd for the chemicals of growth and replenishment . This was especially true of Carrel . Nor has Carrel ever had any illusions concerned with extra-anatomical hearts beating in the coat pockets of angina-pectoris victims . With decay setting in in the brain tissue of the cortex a few moments after death , there is little hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less of keeping them alive with a mess of gears , rocker arms and glass tubes . We do n't like the word impossible nowadays but we can say impractical with much less chance of suffering the humiliation of the discredited prophet at a later date . Without courting professional scorn , we may hold a // that such mechanisms as we have been discussing may some day be perfected to a point where they will keep even human hearts alive for months after their owners have left this world . A dying man may yet bequeath his heart or his spleen to some sufferer , unknown to him at the time , who will need such a spare part . Millions of healthy organs are left to molder in the grave while millions still alive wander about removed only a door or two from the undertaker 's . Perhaps even we , or at least the younger of us , may live to see a surgeon go to his sterilized ice-box to pull down a fresh kidney for immediate implantation . Not a few men are already moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electricity may not merely touch life . It may be life . We certainly know that in its vibratory form it functions in its own mysterious way . The murky light by which we still see has not yet permitted us to tie our categories up very tight but we are patient little Boy Scouts wandering around in the woods of ignorance and eventually we shall be able to bind our facts together . We still need that unifying touch of some giant like Pasteur with his mighty and tenacious capacity to condense crystalline drops of water from pure fog . New facts are coming faster today because we have newer and better instruments with which to work . The lumps of energy we handle are smaller and more subtle but we find them and measure them even though their actions defy interpretation . Right now we // are wallowing around in a sea of new material that has poured in on us like a mighty flood . Radio communication may usher in a new era of biology . High-frequency current , first generated only by the rapidly diminishing discharges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum tubes . That is more important than it sounds unless we stop to do a little serious thinking . With a vacuum tube , we may control the frequency and the magnitude of such currents . Electrons can be made to jump back and forth in a circuit as many as 40 million times a second . With this prodigious agility we can now match the rhythm produced by nature in the human body . Vibrations in the still-lower portion of the spectrum of electro-magnetic impulses can not be reached , but we have gone a long way . If the body harbors high-frequency electricity we may match it , and in the matching may learn something . Signs of the curative power of these madly swirling currents are just being brought to light . Many more conservative medicos are still reluctant to admit this . We shall leave them with their honest doubts until proof accumulates to refutation . Hundreds , nay , thousands , of sincere men are convinced of the therapeutic value of short ( radio ) wave therapy . Clinical evidence is piling up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cure , at least of alleviation , are walking the streets . The pharmacopoeia of electrons is being written . // Naturally , many of the older medicos recoil from this radio-therapy business . The old standby formulas are good enough for them . To tell them that a kidney has a dielectric constant of 200 at 12 meters means nothing . Those who are engaged in this new field of electromedicine , however , are convinced that it is here to stay and grow . Electric treatment is closer to the fountain of life than is medical treatment . Of that we can be fairly sure . Curious and wonderful are the effects of high-frequency radio currents when induced in the animal organism . The means employed to generate such currents are the same as those employed in ordinary radio communication . The body merely acts like a shortcircuited radio receiver when the " broadcaster " is brought into the proper relationship with it . When a short radio wave becomes entangled with the human flesh it produces heat and this heat , by the proper use of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power unmatched by any other known means . Bread baked in an ordinary oven , for instance , is heated from the surface in , while bread baked with short radio waves is really baked from the inside out producing a trustless result , long the aim of bakers . In the case of medical treatment , it is almost impossible to localize an internal effect . When we take a drug the whole body is involved ; undesired changes may take place throughout the whole system while one very small area is being treated . This is not so with // radio or short-wave therapy . The action may be made quite selective . An arthritic shoulder may have coupled to it a pliable cable electrode that will create a deep-seated heat in a small area . Willis R. Whitney of the General Electric Company was the first to observe the general hyperpyrexia caused by short radio waves . Some of his research underlings developed uncomfortable fevers while working in proximity to a high-power , ultra-high-frequency radio transmitter . The researchers of the General Electric Company never pass up things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity in the matter resulted in the radiotherm , a powerful engine for the inducement of artificial fever . The patient is merely laid between two large metal plates connected to a garden-variety type of radio broadcaster . " But why artificial fever ? " , you may ask . The layman is very apt to pose such a question because he is a little out-of-date in his physiology . To him , the fever is to be fought tooth and nail . In the old days , physicians struggled to cut off the heat . Now they recognize fever for just what it is ; a part of nature 's defense mechanism to kill infection by " boiling " the germs to death . This was a most logical concept but it took the medical profession a few centuries to arrive at such a conclusion . The normal , healthy body has a temperature plus or minus a few hundredths of a degree , of 98.6 . It can survive an internal temperature of 107.5 degrees // without passing over the threshold of death , something that most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few terribly uncomfortable hours , the human organism will positively recover from an attack of the dreaded gonorrhea . Aided by a medicinal application of arsenic , the body may also fight off a case of primary or secondary syphilis . Cases are also on record where it survived tertiary syphilis with paresis thrown in for good measure . Surely we must begin to recognize the therapeutical value of such equipment . We are still pretty much on the threshold of this new science . Much remains to be done but the beginning has been auspicious enough . Many cases of St. Vitus ' dance involving acute infection have been cured in 16 days as compared to the 3 months needed for ordinary medical care . So difficult a thing to treat medically as atrophic arthritis responds quite readily and encouragingly to the fever machine . Hypertrophic cases still offer stubborn resistance but then the art is new . Acute neuritic pains cease under the balm of the radio wave , and asthma , when not associated with allergy , improves to a remarkable extent . Experiments now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too early to warrant unrestrained enthusiasm . The alarming growth of arthritis , rheumatism , and neuritis is not difficult to understand . Such suffering is part of the price we are paying for our robots . Cer132 MACHINES OVER MEN tainly nature never intended that we should lead the pampered , sheltered lives that we do . Rather , she intended that we should work and sweat for our food and our fire . Only by working and sweating can we excrete the dangerous toxins that otherwise accumulate to plague us with pain , stiffness and premature old age . Our laziness is almost professional . At every point in our lives the robot is there to serve us . We are wilting racially at a very rapid rate , the price of indolence carried to an extreme . This whole business of artificial fever may go back to the need for a good sweat once a day . Whitney 's rail iotherm is a copious producer of highfrequency waves reaching from 20 to 50 million cycles per second . Charles F. Kettering of the General Motors Research Corp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever machine which he calls a hypertherm and in which he bathes the patient with hot blasts of humid air . In the body internal heat is created and the body fights off its infections by the use of it . If by a robot we mean the development of artificial movement and conditions , we certainly have a right to place the fever cabinet and the " iron lung , " so called , in this category . These things are machines pure and simple . A century or two ago , the doctor had precious few mechanical aids . Today he is faced with a confusing assortment of gadgets , many of them electrical . And where this fever therapy will end no one appears // to know . On the face of it , it would appear as the logical conclusion of Pasteur 's great work . Ile found that infection was the result of an invasion of microorganisms whose end-products or toxins were left in the body to poison it of times unto death . For the first time , we appear to have a machine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can complete their job . Should this be true , we may well shudder at the problem of over-population . To those who have been condemned by nature in the interests of racial fitness , we lend the hand of the robot that they may be pulled back again into the society of more able men . The apple rotting in the basket and communicating its disease to its fresh companions is not a pleasant allegory but it does appear to have a lesson . During our more rational moments , we can not help but ask ourselves if our humanitarianism is really humane . The robot is beginning to offer wholesale escape from premature death . Dare we embrace him ? If we should , the struggle to live will eventually become more exhausting , perhaps , of pure necessity , savage . Either way we look at it , the future is not too bright . Returning to the radio fever machine , we are interested to learn that selective organic or pathological effects may be had with definite frequencies . Body fat appears to respond best to 4-meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters . Gall , wine and blood , all of them electrolytic in nature , are heated by the use of tiny waves , 0.76 , 0.37 and 1 // meter respectively . What the fever therapists want now is a radio tube that will emit waves 7/lOths of a meter long , which is just another way of saying that they need a current of 320 million cycles per second . Such a current or wave , if we wish , would heat the bloodstream alone and this would tend to catch and boil germ matter while in the vehicle that distributes it throughout the body . In a more crude way , that was what Dr. Julius Wagner von Jauregg of Vienna tried to do when he fought paresis by inoculating his patients with malaria . The fever of malaria helped to kill the syphilis bacillus . Many problems remain to he ironed out before this robot , Electricus meili ( us , can he perfected . Our medicos must first decide whether the internal bath of heat kills germs directly or whether it merely stimulates the germicidal substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At any rate we must know . Then , too , we shall have to determine dosage , intensity and selectivity in a better , more accurate way . A word or two concerning the radio knife might not be amiss here . When a high-frequency current is fed to the blade of such a knife , the current density ( that is , the area compared with the strength of the current ) becomes so great that contact with tissue will bring minute steam explosions within the cells and the tissue will be separated in this manner . No shock is felt because the cells are electrolytic and their ions ( charged atoms or molecules ) , under the extremely rapid reTHE // versals of such current , do not have time to change their direction of motion and hence cause no neuromuscular contraction . At the point where the radiothermic device contacts the flesh , it not only severs it but also , due to the highly-concentrated heat , seals the capillaries and cauterizes the wound as it moves along . A whole abdomen may be opened wide with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the years to come , the brutal scalpel will give way to this tool and no one will lament its passing . Electro-coagulation is also something that will bear watching . Today we are convinced that the shuffling of the ancestral pack is done between the chromosomes and the genes , those infinitesimal controllers of heredity . A few years ago , J. B. S. Haldane , a biologist of world renown , wrote a fanciful essay on the ectogenetic child ? the child , in words less technical , born outside its mother . His predictions were most amusing but not by any means so far removed from possibilities as many of his readers believed . Children sired by a robot of neuter gender , while by no means imminent , may yet come . There should be no moral scruples to hurdle . Of course , much that is twaddle and nonsense has been said about the fertilization of human ovum outside the human body . At times we have been told that mama gorillas will be employed to spare wealthy women the rigors of childbirth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor is it apt to come . Dr. Gregory Pincus , Harvard professor of physi136 MACHINES OVER MEN ology , provided fat for the fires that Haldane kindled when he artificially induced mammalian life . From a male rabbit , he squeezed sperm cells . From a female , he took an ovum . After fertilizing the ovum in a test tube , he implanted the result in a third female rabbit who , four weeks later , bore a litter genealogically unrelated to her . She was indeed a host mother . Pincus did not stop here . lie carried his work just a step further and created a semi-ectogenic life that came within an inch or so of the ultimate bull's-eye that Haldane had set up to shoot at . The overbearingly proud male , the heaver of chests and the spouter of big talk minus pain , was given a most humiliating role to play . In fact , he was thrown bodily out of the life cycle . Motherhood came by proxy . To accomplish this , Pincus heated an ovum to 113 degrees Fahrenheit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the uterus of a female rabbit where they grew to the foetus stage . No birth had been permitted up to the last that was heard of the daring doctor , but here was something alarmingly new . Although the work of Pincus has dealt male supremacy a sad blow , Father still has the right to do a bit of strutting . After all , he supplies the Y chromosomes , and boy babies would be impossible without them . No salt solution will provide such a unit . Of course , the confirmed feminist is not so sure that a wholly female world is not to be desired . // Dr. Pincus has not dared to say just how far he can go in controlling the character , both mental and physical , of his baby rabbits . Right now the chances are against his doing very much about the matter for our knowledge along this line is not satisfactory . There is precious little that we know about the mysterious blending of the chromosomes and the genes . Haldane went so far as to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the units , over this design that is now so individualistic . When that comes , Haldane claims , we shall be able to foreordain musicians , mathematicians and , conversely , human robots so senseless and painless that they will shoulder the labors of the world and permit their masters to rot away in luxury . The science of genetics , if such it may be called with so little known , so much to learn , is being attacked from many angles . Dr. Thomas H. Morgan of the California Institute of Technology is in the vanguard of the host of laboratory tinkers throughout the world who are probing in the well of life hoping by design or chance to make a contribution to knowledge . In his work , Dr. Morgan uses Drosophila inelanogaster , the fruit fly to us . This busy little fellow is active in more ways than one , being a most prolific generator of life . He produces from 25 to 30 generations a year . With such a species , geneticists may make countless experiments during a few years . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law // save to say that the transmission of characteristics through a regular system is covered by it . The true mechanism of this process is not known but we are knocking at the door . It is a strange thing , this transmission of characteristics . The little boy with his father 's likeness may have to boot little mannerisms that are inherited . A peculiar inflexion of the voice , a twinkle in the eye or an idiosyncrasy in walking may have its secret back in the tiny units brought together at conception . That light generated at an inter-atomic , electrical fountain may carry with it something about the secret of life is becoming increasingly logical . New species of fruit flies have been created by exposing their larvae to Gamma or X-rays . Perhaps the cosmic rays reaching the earth are exerting a profound influence on the life process for all we know about it . The difference between a thief and an honest banker may rest upon an Alpha particle or a neutron striking a vital part of the gerniplasm . And if it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vega , it may well be that astrology rests on a rather firm foundation . We do n't know , but we are still young and hopeful . The state of genetics as a whole is a little too fluid as yet to hazard many guesses as to the ultimate explanation of what is already known . At the present moment , the work of a century may have to be reinterpreted through the experiments of Dr. Ethel B. // Harvey . She is discovering strange and heretofore unknown properties resident in the cytoplasm , that part of the germ cell outside the nucleus , long thought to be the seat of all important activity . By separating the cytoplasmic portion of the cell from the nucleus , in a stroboscopically illuminated centrifuge , this amazingly patient and scholarly woman has shown that the cytoplasmic matter is able to divide itself and reproduce by division . Without benefit of chromosomes or nucleus , she grows unfertilized cells of Arbacia punctulata or sea urchins . Standing between us and the investigation of prenatal chromosomes and genes in their earliest union is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fathom the mystery . We need better microscopes , and here there is a technical limit , for nothing can be seen that is so small that it will not reflect the waves of visible light . When a body is less than a half-a-wavelength in diameter , we are unable to see it . Sight beyond the limit of the ordinary microscope has been achieved by the use of ultra-violet light or short waves using photographic film , but it is a slow , cumbersome process lacking in color sensitivity . Yet if we are going at this chromosome-gene problem we must have better , bigger eyes . Here the ubiquitous electron enters again to help us . Strange though it may be to the technical tyro , electrons have optical properties . Did not young Hertz show that they could be reflected and refracted ? But // what about lens ; electrons passing through glass to be focused at a point ? They will not pass through glass lenses , to be sure , but that does not mean that they can not be focused with electrostatic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided us with an electron microscope that employs electrostatic fields arranged in a gradually diminishing series to bring the electrons to focus . This does not help us much in visualizing the microscope , however . The matter is still pretty foggy . Perhaps we had better get down to cases and provide a more detailed description for here is something big and vital that wilI hear watching . We know that in the case of the photo-electric cell , light will release electrons when it strikes a surface of sodium or potassium in an evacuated glass tube . These electrons , being negative units of electricity , may be sucked away from such surfaces at high speed if a positively charged plate is placed near the point of release . Furthermore , we must also know that when highspeed electrons strike certain chemical mixtures , they set up a fluorescence which generates a form of visible light . Now we are ready to construct our electron microscope . At one end and inside of a cylindrical glass tube we have an electron-emitting surface . Therefore , light striking from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , there is arranged a series of charged metal rings that set up strong electric fields // within the tube and these cause the electrons to behave optically ; that is , they can be made to travel in lines like light waves just as though they were passing through a glass lens . As a result of this action , they are focused on a fluorescent screen on the opposite end of the tube . When they strike here , countless millions of them , they will set up a form of illumination . Thus , if we waved our hand at the photo-electric end of the tube , we should be able to see a shadowy outline of it at the photo-fluorescent end . Should a microscope be backed up to the photo-electric end of the device , we could see whatever happened , to be on the stage of the purely optical instrument . Again here is something new and hopeful . We can see electrically and the object that is smaller than a half wave-length of light may be " illuminated " after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons . Still more important , even if this may not be possible , is the fact that the electron microscope is really more sensitive to light that we can not see . In short , it performs better , releases more electrons with short waves in the ultra-violet section of the light spectrum . There is a bare chance that organic matter is also emitting waves that may tell much . We already know of the M-rays or mitogenetic rays that are given off by rapidly growing tissue . Nature may well have others that are actually broadcasting the secret of life itself . Maybe we shall be able to see them . We are on // pretty safe ground when we say that the electron microscope will eventually permit us to see particles smaller than those ever before seen . The chromosomes and the genes had better watch out . It is in diagnosis that the average doctor makes his most serious mistakes . IIe may operate on a pregnant woman for appendicitis or reach a perfectly normal organ in a major operation . Such mistakes are rarely publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If an engineer builds a bridge that falls and carries ten people to their deaths , he is a marked man , but not so with the medicos . What is needed is surer diagnosis to enable the more dull-witted members of the profession to reduce the number of their silly but often fatal errors . For some time it has been known that the skin of the human body suffers a change in its electrical potential or voltage under extreme emotional disturbance . We also know that doctors often prick and pinch the skins of their patients in an effort to diagnose an internal derangement accompanied by outer pain . Here two plus two may actually equal four . Perhaps inner pain gives rise to severe changes in the epidermal voltage . Today we have the sensitive apparatus necessary to detect such differences or changes in voltage . Drs . Spiegel and Wohl , using a Sanborn string galvanometer , have found that such areas of disturbances may be localized by exploration with an electrode connected to this instrument . A stationary silver // electrode is fastened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this method were found to have hypersensitive areas associated with diseases of their internal organs . The potential of such areas exceeded normal by as much as thirty millivolts . Non-chemical methods of treatment , which may he either purely electrical or mechanical , are being intro duced at a very rapid rate . The body is found to re spond with encouraging speed and often in connection with cases that utterly defy the older methods of treat ment . The gangrenous foot of the arteriosclerosis vic tim is a case in point , along with the badly frozen pedal extremity . Such things call for quick amputa tion . Dr. Louis G. Hermann has invented a glass boot for such cases and its use at the Vascular Clinic of the Cincinnati General Hospital has given much promise . The boot , hermetically sealed to the patient 's leg , is connected to a vacuum pump which functions inter mittently from two to four times a minute . A pulsat ing action results ; waves of varying pressure stimulate the flow of blood to the affected parts . Legs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife by this crude mechanical equipment used to re-place drugs . How many other answers to bodily mal adjustment , to pain and disease lie in gears , gadgets , pumps or batteries rather than in the pharmacopoeia ? The story does not end here ; it is far too long to be given in this book . // It has been claimed that Russian experimenters have succeeded in removing the entire blood supply of small animals , " washed " it and returned it without apparent injury to the beast . While we should prefer to take the position of the citizen from Missouri in the matter , we do not have to delay our opinion of the work being done by Drs . Kenneth Cooley and Kristian G. Hansson here in the United States . These daring , imaginative experimenters attach a small pump to an opening in one arm , px'rmit the passing blood to be irradiated with germicidal ultra-violet light on its way to the other arm where it again enters the human body . Dangerous losses in heat are prevented by a critical speed . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wholesale purification of the bloodstream may one day be the total and final answer to quick , sure cure for any infectious disease . A whole volume could be devoted to light therapy . New cures are coming from unexpected sources . Treatment by drugs may be fast fading from the realm of medicine . And so the robot marches on in medicine and surgery . What we may logically expect from it all is difficult to say . Of course , we could go on and on with fanciful predictions but predictions of this sort are more or less meaningless because they never take into consideration some new discovery which may totally change the course of events over night . Medical science does appear , however , to be emerging into new // light , and the essentials for an almost wholly robotized form of treatment appear to be in the process of rapid perfection . The attending physician is guessing less and may be placing less faith in drugs . A new machinery for curing is in the making . Not only that , but diagnosis is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ohms , mega-cycles , pH , micro-volts , milli-amperes and coulombs are beginning to find their way into medical literature . Where there is electricity there may be hope . CHAPTER V THE ROBOT ON THE FARM AND IN THE HOME SINCE time immemorial , men have sought security and protection against a capricious and brutal nature . Nature , unrestrained and apparently unmindful of their well-being , burned around them like a fierce fire from which only those biologically fit and strong could emerge . The birth of the inventive faculty and the urge to persist in it was at least partially stimulated by the bleak winters , the warning red glow on the crest of volcanos , the droughts , the floods and the shivering , awesome ribbons of lightning that streaked down from the heavens . It was a hostile , uncompromising world filled with terror , and brute man called out for protection and defense against it . If we add to this powerful motivation for safety the wish to release brawn and muscle from bondage we have a soundly established catalogue of the psychological factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . It is paradoxical in the extreme that this powerful urge toward security should eventuate not only in biologically less-fit specimens but in new and threatening evidence of growing defeat at a time when the protective inventions of man have reached a high degree 146 // of perfection . The trouble appears to be psychological rather than technical . Social wisdom , dogged by the acid fear of failure and frustrated to an alarming degree , is pulling up in the rear of science and engineering . The spiritual and moral side of human character has been outstripped by the creative side as it involves the technical application of brute materials . The eroding threat of insecurity not only badgers individuals but nations as well . Whole peoples issue crude herd cries for national self-sufficiency in a world that no longer offers such a sustaining luxury . We are caught in the web of interdependence . In a desperate effort to defeat and break it , we have entered a period of isolated , undeclared wars . The period of coalescence promises early arrival in the form of world-wide catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general sense of futility after the last call of the trumpet . If technology as applied to armed defense has proven anything , it has shown that moral victory alone , hollow and unsatisfying , is very apt to follow armed combat between nations . In a blind , confused way , soldiers are no longer fighting the machines in the trenches but the robots back of the trenches ; the robots in the metallurgical , munitions , and airplane factories . Doubtlessly technology , fostered in a soil of hopeless social incompetence , has brought us to this sad pass . The worldwide catastrophe that apparently must come will either kill or cure . Taking the more opti148 MACHINES OVER MEN mistic alternative , it may be said that a proper use of our machine wealth offers new and startling possibilities for a form of personal and national security . In this chapter we shall try to find new hope , new courage to carry on if present technical trends may be relied upon as an index to the future . We shall unfortunately have to leave out the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision will be predicated only on technical accomplishments . We can not go into the psychological factors that may defeat the social benefits which would logically follow the inventions to be discussed . If we should trace the application of power , since its advent , in the home and on the farm ( especially in the United States ) we should discover a rather amazing parallel with the factory at the time of the introduction of electricity and the passing of the steam age . The individually motorized unit made its appearance . The farmer now living in serviced territories where there is a decent relationship between the cost of producing power and the cost of using it , has his irrigation pumps , house service , water pumps , silage cutters , cream separators , grinding wheels , ice-boxes and vacuum cleaners . Power flows into his home and barns in a new and convenient form , easily controlled , easily carried . The serious invasion of the urban and farm home by the machine or robot did not occur until the advent of electric power generated in alternating-curTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce resistance losses to a commercially feasible point . On the whole , the urban home is perhaps more completely motorized than the farm home . There is the vacuum cleaner , the refrigerating machine , the oilburner , air conditioner , ventilating fan , batter mixer , silver polisher , floor polisher , hair dryer , automatic garage doors , massagers , bench lathe , toy train and a host of other still more luxurious appliers of power . The introduction of these things has been fast and furious and the groundwork for more complete robotization has been amply laid . We need only the automatic touch , the taming bit . A wonderful , magic fluid lies dammed up in every socket , every floor plug . For the moment we shall abandon our pet theme of the home secure and self-sustaining . A general discussion of the robots that have been and are being mobilized for immediate invasion will help us better to appreciate the things that may come and indeed will come if T.N.T . does not blast our dream totally and finally . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical inventors should be bowed in shame at the mere mention of the word . Years ago Edison showed us how to prevent an electrically-heated filament from burning itself out by placing it in a vacuum . He was not the first man to have the idea but lie was the first one that had the tenacity of purpose to conduct the heart-breaking experiments that led up to success . // Although we are mighty proud of our lights , on the scale of efficiency they rate with our gasoline engines , which is just another way of saying that they are terrible . The reciprocating engine with its shameful waste of power should have no place in our economy , and yet it still enjoys widespread use . With our automobiles , we are capable of generating 1,200,000,000 horsepower from gasoline alone . A haunting notion of the inefficiency involved may be had by scratching off 82 per cent of this power as being hopelessly lost in useless heat and the overcoming of inertia . Modern , high-pressure steam turbines , with their blades operating at reel heat with steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , but the turbine still lacks the essentials of efficiency . The point that we are driving here is that while the efficiency of our most-used units of power is disgustingly out of line with that which we should have the right to expect , it is still high when compared to electric illumination in any of its commercially-used forms . Where the gas engine converts 18 per cent of the energy fed to it into useful power , the electric light , vintage of 1937 , converts only 5 per cent . A more efficient converter of energy into light would reduce a $10.00 light bill to 50 cents . Such desired efficiency , however , can never be attained by the heated filament . Some new and revolutionary emitter must be found . The answer , it would seem , lies in electrically-excited gases such as various // combinations now in use for advertising purposes . We certainly can not romanticize about the banishment of night without poetic license until such a thing is brought about . The brightness of the sun as seen from the earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tables as authority . Flenbaas and Bol , working in the Philadelphia Laboratories , recently exhibited a mercury-vapor-filled glass tube 31/2 mm. in diameter and 10 mm. long that more than rivaled this solar brilliancy with 1,160,000 candlepower per square inch . This tube , for various reasons , is not the answer to our prayer for lower light bills but it helped show the way . Soon we shall have gaseous illuminators that will require small current and that will really illuminate . Experimental tubes of this kind have shown that they may be extinguished and re-excited without evidence of optical interruption as many as 100,000 times a second . With a robot electron-tube interrupter ( easily possible ) , we dare to envisage a lamp that will give continuous illumination over a period of one year although it will actually burn for less than 20 solid minutes during the year . Something for the utility men to worry about . Or is it ? There is little reason to believe that we can not illuminate both our homes and our yards for less than $5.00 a year and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With lamps that // will remain lighted with fly-power rather than horsepower , we may easily eliminate the maze of electric wires that now snake through rafters and studdings . Considerable work has been done on the electrodeless induction ( really wireless ) radiators . After all , we transmit thousands of horsepower daily by wireless , and tiny motors have been operated over laboratorywide distances by power so transmitted . There is no reason why such lamps could not be made with quartz envelopes so that they would issue germicidal rays . We owe a large measure of our present illnesses to the absence of sunlight . Nature gave us ultra-violet light to generate vitamin D from ergosterol and now we hide from it preferring to buy irradiated codliver oil as a substitute . A tiny lamp of this kind would also do yeoman service in preserving food in the absence of germ-arresting cold . The electric ice-box is a clumsy contraption preserving our germs rather than killing them . Our bacteriologists kept their most dangerous bacilli in ice-boxes that they may slumber in peace ! The ordinary photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Many important services lie within its range . Thirty dollars ' worth of equipment would have prevented the loss of the Lindbergh child and the national hysteria and Navy race that this lamentable but highly-emotionalized tragedy caused . Just a single cell mounted at the window would have done the trick and averted the tragedy . The light // actuating the cell might have been invisible . We shall have a widespread use of the photo cell when mass production makes it worth the price of a 100-watt bulb rather than the price of an evening in the Rainbow Room . Not only will the cell detect burglars and kidnapers but fire as well . Perhaps it will even release a few thousand cubic feet of that cheap but useful gas CO2 to smother the blaze without damage from water or the all-too-destructive fireman 's ax . David Sarnoff , bristling president of the Radio Corporation of America , used to dream of the day when a man might enter a telegraph office and file for transmission the front page of a newspaper . In short , he dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The melody of that dream has been crystallized into reality . The robot hurler of pictures and words is out of the laboratory earning his own living now in rather handsome style . The facsimile machine with its photo-cell orb makes a veritable one-hoss shay out of contemporary telegraphic equipment even with its robot-operated tele-typewriters and carrier-wave circuits . The best a champion tele-typist might do with the full front page of the New York Times would be to copy it in an hour 's time . Facsimile transmission could lay it down in Hong Kong or London within ten minutes . But the Postal and Western Union ; what about them ? Just another ugly clash between finance and // technology . What about the newspapers ? Still another clash . The morning news-sheet torn from the automatic radio set is no idle dream . Much less , it stands ready for immediate use . The chances are only fair , however , that we shall have the facsimile-type news robot in our homes . Quite possibly television will beat the gun and arrive first . Given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall not need the slower facsimile method . At four in the morning , the television receiver is automatically snapped on , the operator at the transmitter holds a printed form before the televisor and out goes page after page of the newspaper to be caught and held for the breakfast table in millions of homes . A pleasant dream for Mr. Sarnoff , but a nightmare for the publishers . One man 's meat becomes another man 's poison with a vengeance . Of course , those who like to dream in more fanciful style about the future of electrical image transmission do not stop at Broadway shows or radiopeddled newspapers . The supply of technical dreamstuff is too ample to imply such limitations . We now handle sight and sound ; why should we not be able to stimulate the other senses as well ? Reference has already been made to a modulated plastic medium that might take care of the desire to feel over a distance . While such a makeshift might not satisfy the demands of the baldheaded fellow in the first row at // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . What about smell ? Can the olfactory organ be reached over the radio wave ? Perhaps . If the nasal passages respond to vibrations in the mariner of the rods and cones of the retina , we might be able to produce definite illusions of smell that would at least be on a par with synthetic orange and lemon juice . Dr. Arthur D. Little classified odors as ( 1 ) fragrance , ( 2 ) acid , ( 3 ) burnt , ( 4 ) caprylic . As O. H. Caldwell pointed out , using an index number of 9 for each quality , a rose might be indicated by the figure 6523 ; 6 as its fragrance , 5 for its acidity , 2 for its burnt and 3 for the lingering evidence of the goat . Arcady by radio is a new number for the poets . What goes for smell may well go for taste . And let us not think that a radio message can not be tasted . Years ago , during the war , Dr. Alfred N. Goldsmith developed a " message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hear " over the roar of the engine . Once we tune in on the wave-length of taste , if it has one , the rest is easy . That future Burton Holmes of television may well be at some German spa and invite his lookers-in to taste the water . Or are we just gone plumb mad ? These sojourns into the future are a bit exhausting . Let us return to terra firma . Coming back to that old standby , the photo cell , we shall see that we have not yet touched the limit of its applications even in its // current form . Time will tell many interesting photoelectric stories , Reading for the blind with photo books is one of them and even today we may leave on a vacation assured that our photo robot back home will faithfully turn the living-room light on at sundown and turn it out again at sunup . A prowler in the yard at night may find himself exposed with a floodlight ; incomplete combustion in our oil furnaces may cause a photo tube mounted in the flue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomizer . So slight a thing as the gathering of moisture on a windowpane can set off a photo cell . We are able to record sound photographically on cellophane or paper tape , and we presently may have photo-electric readers , novel-size in capacity . Our music libraries may be composed of these readers . And let 's not forget a photocell piano or organ . That would be jolly . In these predictions our feet are on pretty firm ground , and where the photo cell alone is concerned , we could go on and on to that " well-you-guess-now " period , but we shall stop . Years ago some one wrote a book called " The Kingdom of Dust . " We shall perhaps never know the real importance of the billions of microscopic dust particles about us . The housewife , although she is serenely unaware of the fact , gathers up the dust from burned-out meteors every day . Dust particles are the condensation nuclei for raindrops and we are pathologically sensitive to many forms of them . Pollen is // one form that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-touted air-conditioning equipment has a hard time with it . Over a quarter of a century ago , Cottrell showed Western copper smelters how the solid particles of dust in smokestacks could be precipitated by passing them between heavily-charged plates . To charge these plates in those days was quite a chore , for high-voltage direct current had to be used . There was " no such animal , " so Cottrell took high-voltage alternating current and with a noisy rotary spark-gap and a synchronous motor rectified it . The result was a costly , messy job but it worked and not only re-captured valuable products going up the flues but saved lawsuits from being filed by justifiably irate farmers . Cottrell 's scheme is still in use but his equipment has gone the way of the morning-glory phonograph horn . In place of his huge , crashing rotary gap and his bulky synchronous motors there are a few electron tubes on a rack . They rectify enough alternating current to electrocute a boxcarful of bulls without fuss or noise . But what has this to do with the home or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows or air conditioners may yet pass between ionizing plates fed by a small rectifier tube to keep our homes free of pollen and other unwanted things . Insects , small or large , would suffer instant death and the effective isolation of hay-fever sufferers would be complete . // Air , thermal and sound conditioning , is making a Roman holiday for the ad men . In a way , this is fortunate for we were getting a bit tired of the whitesmocked scientist standing beside his ever-present microscope with a can of vitamin-smothered beans in hand . The vitamin inspired the greatest triumph in advertising since Peruna . Not to say that vitamins are not important . They are , but they were reduced to the level of copywriters ' empty superlatives . Much that is being said about various forms of air conditioning for the home amounts to one thing in the laboratory and is multiplied by 10 in the advertising offices . Peering into the future , we see a truly sound-conditioned house . Once more the little cathode-ray tube , small editions of which now sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a home which , though in the center of a roaring metropolis , will be as quiet as a tomb . To understand the operation of the proposed sound annihilator , we shall have to bear in mind two facts . One is that sound travels about 1,100 feet a second while light steps along at 186,000 miles a second . Then there is the fact that two light waves , each of the same length , are capable of bumping into each other , or , as the physicist says , interfering with each other , in such a way as to produce total darkness . Young demonstrated that before we were born . There is no reason why two sound waves of the same intensity and wave-length could not be made to collide with each other in such a way as to bring about // mutual annihilation or silence . The great difference between the speed of sound and the speed of light favors accomplishing this . Suppose we have a microphone mounted in our front yard . The sound of a passing truck strikes it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another light-sensitive tube gathers in the analysis , and before the oncoming sound from the truck has had the opportunity of passing across our lawn on the way to the house , a counter-acoustic barrage has been prepared and rushes forth to meet and slay the noisy intruders . There may be a faint odor of scientific charlatanry to this suggestion but it is offered seriously . No one is asked to be unduly gullible . On the other hand , the incredulous conservatives have had to eat plenty of husks during the last fifty years . The first steamship to cross the ocean carried in its mailsacks a letter from a mathematical physicist who , to his own satisfaction at least , had shown mathematically why it was impossible for a vessel to carry enough coal to push its way across the Atlantic . The forces of radio are being slowly mobilized for human good or ill . Mass communication in the hands of a psychopathic dictator is one thing . In the hands of a Walter Damrosch or an Eddie Cantor it is quite another . Barring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trees and caves from which we so presumptuously came , radio will yet bring us many more benefits and pain de-
