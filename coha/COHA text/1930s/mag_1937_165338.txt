On the 1,700-odd U. S. railroads from the Aberdeen &; Rockfish to the Yreka Western , all conventional locomotives have what engineers call a ' ' Johnson bar " -a manually-operated seven-foot steel lever which puts the locomotive either in reverse or forward motion and also controls the flow of new steam into the boilers to adjust speed . On small engines the Johnson bar causes no trouble , has been used for 50 years without improvement . When bigger engines began to appear 20 years ago , however , handling the bar became back-breaking work and the Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen began agitating for relief . Then came the power reverse gear which did the same job by air or steam-pressure released by nicking a small lever . Insisting on its installation , the Brotherhoods four years ago got the Interstate Commerce Commission to order it . Because each installation costs $500 , the railroads fought the case to the U. S. Supreme Court where the I.C.C . ruling was reversed because of a technical error . <P> Meanwhile the 131 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Brotherhoods by agreeing to put the power reverse gear on all new engines and on old ones brought in for Class 2 repairs . The Brotherhoods then asked the I.C.C . to drop the matter , but the I.C.C. , anxious to assert itself , refused . Last week it ruled that the gear must be installed on all new engines and on old ones brought in for Class 3 repairs. * The minor U. S. roads for whom the change will be a major expense indicated that they would again appeal . <P> <P> *Class 1 repair is a new boiler . Class 2 is a new firebox . Class 3 are the more frequent general repairs to machinery , firebox , tires or flues . <P> four-@@788094 When Russia established a base at the North Pole last month ( TIME , May 31 &; June 14 ) , many were skeptical about the Soviet 's announced intention of inaugurating a Moscow-San Francisco airline . Last week skeptics were confounded when a Russian plane nonchalantly flew non-stop from Moscow to the U. S. via the North Pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Designer A. N. Tupoleff ) monoplane with one engine , 112 ft. wingspread . To fly it Dictator Stalin chose , not Sigismund Levanevsky as announced , but three other " Heroes of the Soviet Union " - Pilot Valeri Pavlovitch Chkaloff , 33 , Co-Pilot Georgi Phillipovitch Baidukoff , 30 , and Navigator Alexander Vassielievitch Beliakoff , 40 . Last year this trio flew the same plane on a 5,858-mi. non-stop circuit of the Soviet Arctic . Because Levanevsky 's failure on a transpolar flight two years ago brought unfavorable publicity , this year 's venture was kept a dark secret long after the red and grey plane left Moscow . Then a Canadian radio station plucked the news from the ether that : " We are three hours from the Pole , flying nicely . " <P> Like a gnat buzzing over a man 's bald head , the ANT-25 droned along at a bare 100 m. p. h. with its 2,000-gal. load of gas , passed 20 mi. away from the North Pole base .

Only Baidukoff took a nap . Chkaloff stayed at the controls steadily , nursed his ship down over Prince Patrick Island to Ft . Simpson in far northern Canada , then veered to the Pacific Coast , headed down to the U. S. <P> Goal was San Francisco , but fog shut in , the flyers grew exhausted , and finally they turned back from Eugene , Ore. , landed at Pearson Field , the Army 's air base at Vancouver , Wash . Bewhiskered , red-eyed and tottery , they stumbled from their plane , having covered about 5,288 miles in 63 hr. , 17 min. - second longest flight in history and one of the most important in charting an uncharted airway . The trio dragged themselves to the home of Brigadier General George C. Marshall , field commandant , drank his cognac , gobbled his breakfast , used his razor , then fell into his beds while the world applauded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria flown by Frenchmen Paul Codos &; Maurice Rossi in 1933.
