BEYOND A STORY BY WILLIAM FAULKNER MAE hard round ear of the stethoI scope was cold and unpleasant upon his naked chest ; the room , big and square , furnished with clumsy walnut  --  the bed where he had first slept alone , which had been his marriage bed , in which his son had been conceived and been born and lain dressed for the coffin  --  the room familiar for sixty-five years , by ordinary peaceful and lonely and so peculiarly his own as to have the same odor which he had , seemed to he cluttered with people , though there were but three of them and all of them he knew : Lucius Peabody who should have been down town attending to his medical practice , and the two negroes , the one who should be in the kitchen and the other with the lawn mower on the lawn , making some pretence toward earning the money which on Saturday night they would expect . But worst of all was the hard cold little ear of the stethoscope , worse even than the outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray hair . In fact , about the whole business there was just one alleviating circumstance . " At least , " he thought with fretted and sardonic humor , " I am spared that uproar of female connections which might have been my lot , which is the ordinary concomitant of occasions of marriage or divorcement . And if he will just move his damned little toy telephone and let my niggers go back to work ? " And then , before he had finished the thought , Peabody did remove the stethoscope . And then , just as he was settling himself back into the pillow with a sigh of fretted relief , one of the negroes , the woman , set up such a pandemonium of wailing as to fetch him bolt upright in the bed , his hands to his ears . The negress stood at the foot of the bed , her lung limber black hands motionless on the footboard , her cycs whitely backrolled into her skull and her mouth wide open , while from it rolled slow billows of soprano sound as mellow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ch/ory ! " he shouted . " Stop that ! " She did n't stop . Apparently she could neither see nor hear . " You , Jake ! " he shouted to the negro man who stood beside her , his hands too on the footboard , his face brooding upon the bed with an expression darkly and profoundly enigmatic ; " get her out of here ! At once ! " But Jake too did not move , and he then turned to Peabody in angry outrage . " Here ! Loosh ! Get these damn niggers out of here ! " But Peabody also did not seem to hear him . The Judge watched him methodically folding the stethoscope into its case ; glared at him for a moment longer while the woman 's shattering noise billowed through the room . Then he flung the covers back and rose from the bed and hurried furiously from the room and from the house . At once he realized that he was still in his pajamas , so he buttoned his overcoat . It was of broadcloth , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sable collar . " At least they did n't have time to hide this from me , " he thought in fretted rage . " Now , if I just had my . . . " He looked down at his feet . " Mr. I seem to have . . " He looked at his shoes . " That 's fortunate , too . " Then the momentary surprise faded too , now that outrage had space in which to disseminate itself . He touched his hat , then he put his hand to his lapel . The jasmine was there . Say what he would , curse Jake as he often had to do , the negro never forgot whatever flower in its season . Always it would be there , fresh and recent and unblemished , on the morning coffee tray . The flower and the . . . He clasped his ebony stick beneath his arm and opened the briefcase . The two fresh handkerchiefs were there , beside the book . He thrust one of them into his breast pocket and went on . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then for a little while it was definitely unpleasant . He detested crowds : the milling and aimless and patient stupidity ; the concussion of life-quick flesh with his own . But presently , if not soon , he was free , and standing so , still a little ruffled , a little annoyed , he looked back with fading outrage and distaste at the throng as it clotted quietly through the entrance . With fading distaste until the distaste was gone , leaving his face quiet and quite intelligent , with a faint and long constant overtone of quizzical bemusement not yet tinctured with surprised speculation , not yet puzzled , not yet wary . That was to come later . Hence it did not show in his voice , which wasnow merely light , quizzical , contained , " There seems to be quite a crowd of them . " " Yes , " the other said . The Judge looked at him and saw a young man in conventional morning dress with some subtle effluvium of weddings , watching the entrance with a strained , patient air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the other looked at him . " Yes . You did n't see ? But you do n't know her . " " Know whom ? " " My wife . That is , she is not my wife yet , But the wedding was to be at noon . " " Something happened , did it ? " " I had to do it . " The young man looked at him , strained , anxious . " I was late . That 's why I was driving fast . A child ran into the road . I was going too fast to stop . So I had to turn . " " But you missed the child ? " " Yes . " The other looked at him . " You do n't know her ? " " And you are waiting here to . . . " The Judge stared at the other . His eyes were narrowed , his gaze was piercing , hard . He said suddenly , sharply , " Nonsense . " " What ? What did you say ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . The Judge looked away . His frowning concentration , his reflex of angry astonishment , was gone . He seemed to have wiped it from his face by a sudden deliberate action . He was like a man who , not a swordsman , has practiced with a blade a little against a certain improbable crisis , and who suddenly finds himself , blade in hand , face to face with the event . He looked at the entrance , his face alert , musing swiftly : he seemed to muse upon the entering faces with a still and furious concentration , and quietly ; quietly he looked 1 about , then at the other again . The young man still watched him . " You 're looking for your wife too , I suppose , " he said . " I hope you find her . I hope you do . " He spoke with a sort of quiet despair . " I suppose she is old , as you are . It must be hell on the one who has to watch and wait for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is so terrible to wait and watch like me , for a girl who is a maiden to you . Of course I think mine is the most unbearable . You see if it had only been the next day  --  anything . But then if it had , I guess I could not have turned out for that kid . I guess I just think mine is so terrible . It ca n't be as bad as I think it is . It just ca n't be . I hope you find her . " The Judge 's lip lifted . " I came here to escape someone ; not to find anyone . " He looked at the other . His face was still broken with that grimace which might have been smiling . But his eyes were not smiling . " If I were looking for anybody , it would probably be my son . " " Oh . A son . I see . " " Yes . He would be about your age . He was ten when he died . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright , save for his eyes . The other watched him with that grave anxiety leavened now with quiet interested curiosity . " You mean , you do n't believe ? " The Judge laughed aloud . Still laughing , he produced a cloth sack of tobacco and rolled a slender cigarette . When he looked up , the other was watching the entrance again . The Judge ceased to laugh . " Have you a match ? " he said . The other looked at him . The Judge raised the cigarette . " A match . " The other sought in his pockets . " No . " He looked at the Judge . " Look for him here , " he said . " Thank you , " the Judge answered . " I may avail myself of your advice later . " He turned away . Then he paused and looked back . The young man was watching the entrance . The Judge watched him , bemused , his lip lifted . He turned on , then he stopped still . His face was now completely shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn mouth , the delicate nostrils , the eyes all pupil or pupilless . He could not seem to move at all . Then Mothershed turned and saw him . For an instant Mothershed 's pale eyes flickered , his truncated jaw , collapsing steadily with a savage , toothless motion , ceased , " Well ? " Mothershed said . " Yes , " the Judge said ; " it 's me , " Now it was that , as the mesmerism left him , the shadow bewildered and wary and complete , touched his face . Even to himself his words sounded idiotic . " I thought that you were dea . . . " Then he made a supreme and gallant effort , his voice light , quizzical , contained again , " Well ? " Mothershed looked at him  --  a squat man in a soiled and mismatched suit stained with grease and dirt , his soiled collar innocent of tie  --  with a pale , lightly slumbering glare filled with savage outrage . " So they got you here , too , did they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ' and what you mean by ' here . ' " Mothershed made a savage , sweep-ing gesture with one arm . " Here , by God ! The preachers . The Jesus shouters . " " Ah , " the Judge said . " Well , if I am where I am beginning to think I am , I do n't know whether I am here or not . But you are not here at all , are you ? " Mothershed cursed violently . " Yes , " the Judge said , " we never thought , sitting in my office on those afternoons , discussing Voltaire and Ingersoll , that we should ever be brought to this , did we ? You , the atheist whom the mete sight of a church spire on the sky could enrage ; and I who have never been able to divorce myself from reason enough to accept even your pleasant and laborsaving theory of nihilism . " " Labor-saving ! " Mothershed cried . " By God , I .. He cursed with impotent fury . The Judge might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette again . " Have you a match ? " " What ? " Mothershed said . He glared at the Judge , his mouth open . He sought through his clothes . From out the savage movement , strapped beneath his armpit , there peeped fleetly the butt of a heavy pistol . " No , " he said . " I ai n't . " " Yes , " the Judge said . He twisted the cigarette , his gaze light , quizzical . But you still have n't told me what you are doing here . I heard that you had . . " Again Mothershed cursed , prompt , outraged . " I ai n't . I just committed suicide . " He glared at the Judge . " God damn it , 1 remember raising the pistol ; I remember the little cold ring it made against my ear ; I remember when I told my finger on the trigger . . " He glared at the Judge . " I thought that that would be one way I could escape the preachers , since by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at the Judge , his pale gaze apoplectic and outraged . " Well , I know why you are here . You come here looking for that boy . " The Judge looked down , his lip lifted , the movement pouched upward about his eyes . He said quietly , " No . " Mothershed watched him , glared at him . " Looking for that boy . Agnosticism . " He snarled it . " Wo n't say ' Yes ' and wo n't say ' No ' until you see which way the cat will jump . Ready to selI out to the highest bidder . By God , I 'd rather have give up and diedin sanctity , with every heaven-yelping fool in ten miles around .. . " " No , " the Judge said quietly behind the still , dead gleam of his teeth . Then his teeth vanished quietly , though he did not look up . He sealed the cigarette carefully again . " There seem to be a lot of people here . " Mothershed now began to watch him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare arrested . " You have seen other familiar faces beside my own here , I suppose . Even those of men whom you know only by name , perhaps ? " " Oh , " Mothershed said . " I see . I get you now . " The Judge seemed to be engrossed in the cigarette . " You want to take a whirl at them too , do you ? Go ahead . I hope you will get a little more out of them that will stick to your guts than I did . Maybe you will , since you do n't seem to want to know as much as you want something new to be uncertain about . Well , you can get plenty of that from any of them . " " You mean you have . . . " Again Mothershed cursed , harsh , savage . " Sure . Ingersoll . Paine . Every bastard one of them that I used to waste my time reading when I had better been sitting on the sunny side of a log . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Sure . On a bench just inside the park yonder . And maybe on the same bench you 'll find the one that wrote the little women books . If he ai n't there , he ought to be . " So the Judge sat forward , elbows on knees , the unlighted cigarette in his fingers . " So you too are reconciled , " he said . The man who Mothershed said was Ingersoll looked at his profile quietly . " To this place . " " Ah , " the other said . He made a brief , short gesture . " Reconciled . " The judge did not look up . " You accept it ? You acquiesce ? " He seemed to be absorbed in the cigarette . " If I could just see Him , talk to Him . " The cigarette turned slowly in his fingers . " Perhaps I was seeking Him . Perhaps I was seeking Him all the time I was reading your books , and Voltaire and Montesquieu . Perhaps I was . " The cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In your sincerity . I said , if Truth is to be found by man , this man will be among those who find it . At one time  --  I was in the throes of that suffering from a still green hurt which causes even an intelligent man to cast about for anything , any straw  --  I had a foolish conceit : you will be the first to laugh at it as I myself did later . I thought , perhaps there is a hereafter , a way station into nothingness perhaps , where for an instant lesser men might speak face to face with men like you whom they could believe ; could hear from such a man 's own lips the words : ' There is hope , ' or : ' There is nothing . ' I said to myself , in such case it will not be Him whom I shall seek ; it will be Ingersoll or Paine or Voltaire . " He watched the cigarette . " Give me your word now . Say either of these to me . I will believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Then he said , " Why ? Believe why ? " The paper about the cigarette had come loose . The Judge twisted it carefully back , handling the cigarette carefully . " You see , I had a son . He was the last of my name and race . After my wife died we lived alone , two men in the house . It had been a good name , you see . I wanted him to be manly , worthy of it . He had a pony which he rode all the time . I have a photograph of them which I use as a bookmark . Often , looking at the picture or watching them unbeknownst as they passed the library window , I would think What hopes ride yonder ; of the pony I would think What burden do you blindly bear , dumb brute . One day they telephoned me at my office . He had been found dragging from the stirrup . Whether the pony had kicked him or he had struck his head in falling , I never knew . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the briefcase . He took out a book . " Voltaire 's Philosophical Dictionary , " he said . " I always carry a book with me . I am a great reader . It happens that my life is a solitary one , owing to the fact that I am the last of my family , and perhaps to the fact that I am a Republican officeholder in a Democratic stronghold . I am a Federal judge , from a Mississippi district . My wife 's father was a Republican . " He added quickly , " I believe the tenets of the Republican Party to be best for the country . You will not believe it , but for the last fifteen years may one intellectual companion has been a rabid atheist , almost an illiterate , who not only scorns alI logic and science , but who has a distinct body odor as well . Sometimes I have thought , sitting with him in my office on a summer afternoon  --  a damp one  --  that if a restoration of faith could remove his prejudice against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length myself even . " He took a photograph from the book and extended it . " This was my son . " The other looked at the picture without moving , without offering to take it . From the brown and fading cardboard a boy of ten , erect upon the pony , looked back at them with grave and tranquil hauteur . " He rode practically all the time . Even to church ( I attended church regularly then . still do , at times , even now . ) We had to take an extra groom along in the carriage , to . . " He looked at the picture , musing . " After his mother died I never married again . My own mother was sickly , an invalid . I could cajole her . In the absence of my aunts I could browbeat her into letting me go barefoot in the garden , with two house servants on watch to signal the approach of my aunts . I would return to the house , my manhood triumphant , vindicated , until I entered the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for every grain of dust which pleasured my feet , she would pay with a second of her life . And we would sit in the dusk like two children , she holding my hand and crying quietly , until my aunts entered with the lamp . ' Now , Sophia . Crying again . What have you let him bulldoze you into doing this time ? ' She died when I was fourteen ; I was twenty-eight before I asserted myself and took the wife of my choice ; I was thirty-seven when my son was born . " He looked at the photograph , his eyes pouched , netted by two delicate hammocks of myriad lines as fine as etching . " He rode all the time . Hence the picture of the two of them , since they were inseparable . I have used this picture as a bookmark in the printed volumes where his and my ancestry can be followed for ten generations in our American annals , so that as the pages progressed it would be as though with my own eyes I watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and bone had traveled before it became his . " He held the picture . With his other hand he took up the cigarette . The paper had come loose : he held it raised a little and then arrested so , as if he did not dare raise it farther . " And you can give me your word . I will believe . " " Go seek your son , " the other said . " Go seek him . " Now the Judge did not move at all . Holding the picture and the dissolving cigarette , he sat in a complete immobility . He seemed to sit in a kind ofterrible and unbreathing suspension . " And find him ? And find him ? " The other did not answer . Then the Judge turned and looked at him , and then the cigarette dropped quietly into dissolution as the tobacco rained down upon his neat , gleaming shoe . " Is that your word ? I will believe , I tell you . " The other sat , shapeless , gray , sedentary , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop with that . You can not . " Along the path before them people passed constantly . A woman passed , carrying a child and a basket , a young woman in a plain , worn , brushed cape . She turned upon the man who Mothershed had said was Ingersoll a plain , bright , pleasant face and spoke to him in a pleasant , tranquil voice . Then she looked at the Judge , pleasantly , a full look without boldness or diffidence , and went on . " Come . You can not . You can not . " Then his face went completely blank . In the midst of speaking his face emptied ; he repeated " can not . Can not " in a tone of musing consternation . " Can not , " he said . " You mean , you can not give me any word ? That you do not know ? That you , yourself , do not know ? You , Robert Ingersoll ? Robert Ingersoll ? " The other did not move . " Is Robert Ingersoll telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed no stronger than myself ? " Still the other did not look up . " You saw that young woman who just . passed , carrying a child . Follow her . Look into her face . " " A young woman . With a . . . " The Judge looked at the other . " Alt . I see . Yes . I will look at the child and I shall see scars . Then I am to look into the woman 's face . Is that it ? " The other did n't answer . " That is your answer ? your final word ? " The other did not move . The Judge 's lip lifted . The movement pouched upward about his eyes as though de-spair , grief , had flared up for a final instant like a dying flame , leaving upon his face its ultimate and fading gleam in a faint grimace of dead teeth . He rose and put the photograph back into the briefcase . " And this is the man who says that he was once Robert Ingersoll . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been smiling save for the eyes . " It is not proof that I sought . I , of all men , know that proof is but a fallacy invented by man to justify to himself and his fellows his own crass lust and folly . It was not proof that I sought . " With the stick and the briefcase clasped beneath his arm he rolled another slender cigarette . " I do n't know who you are , but I do n't believe you arc Robert Ingersoll . Perhaps I could not know it even if you were . Anyway , there is a certain integral consistency which , whether it be right or wrong , a man must cherish because it alone will ever permit him to die . So what 1 have been , 1 am ; what I am , shall be until that instant comes when I am not . And then I shall have never been . How does it go ? Non fui . Sum .. Fui . Non sum . " With the unlighted cigarette in his fingers he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paused and looked down at the child . It sat in the path at the woman 's feet , surrounded by tiny leaden effigies of men , some erect and some prone . The overturned and now empty basket lay at one side . Then the judge saw that the effigies were Roman soldiers in various stages of dismemberment  --  some headless , some armless and legless  --  scattered about , lying profoundly on their faces or staring up with martial and battered inscrutability from the mild and inscrutable dust . On the exact center of each of the child 's insteps was a small scar . There was a third scar in the palm of its exposed hand , and as the Judge looked down with quiet and quizzical bemusement , the child swept flat the few remaining figures and he saw the fourth scar . The child began to cry . " Shhhhhhhhh , " the woman said . She glanced up at the Judge , then she knelt and set the soldiers up . The child cried steadily , with a streaked and dirty face , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the woman said , " See ? Here ! Here 's Pilate too ! Lookl " The child ceased . Tearless , it sat in the dust , looking at the soldiers with an expression as inscrutable as theirs , suspended , alder-manic , and reserved . She swept the soldiers flat . " There ! " she cried in a fond , bright voice , " See ? " For a moment longer the child sat . Then it began to cry . She took it up and sat on the bench , rocking it back and forth , glancing up at the Judge . " Now , now , " she said . " Now , now . " " Is he sick ? " the Judge said . " Oh , no . He 's just tired of his toys , as children will get . " She rocked the child with an air fond and unconcerned . " Now , now . The gentleman is watching you . " The child cried steadily . " Has n't he other toys ? " the Judge said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't dare walk about the house in the dark . But he likes his soldiers the best An old gentleman who has lived here a Iong time , they say , and is quite wealthy , gave them to him . An old gentleman with a white mustache and that kind of popping eyes that old people have who eat too much ; I tell him so . He has a footman to carry his umbrella and overcoat and steamer rug , and he sits here with us for more than an hour , sometimes , talking and breathing hard . He always has candy or something . " She looked down at the child , her face brooding and serene . It cried steadily . Quizzical , bemused , the Judge stood , looking quietly down at the child 's scarred , dirty feet . The woman glanced up and followed his look . " You are looking at his scars and wondering how he got them , are n't you ? The other children did it one day when they were playing . Of course they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were as surprised as he was . You know how children are when they get too quiet . " " Yes , " the Judge said . " I had a son too . " " You have ? Why do n't you bring him here ? I 'm sure we would be glad to have him play with our soldiers too . " The Judge 's teeth glinted quietly . " I 'm afraid he 's a little too big for toys . " He took the photograph from the briefcase . " This was my son . " The woman took the picture . The child cried steady and strong . " Why , it 's Howard . Why , we see him every day . He rides past here every clay . Sometimes he stops and Jets us ride too . I walk beside to hold him on , " she added , glancing up . She showed the picture to the child . " Look ! See Howard on his pony ? See ? " Without ceasing to cry , the child contemplated the picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached , suspended , as though it were living two distinct and separate lives at one time . She returned the picture . " I suppose you are looking for him . " " Ah , " the Judge said behind his momentary teeth . He replaced the picture carefully in the briefcase , the unlighted cigarette in his lingers . The woman moved on the bench , gathering her skirts in with invitation . " Wo n't you sit down ? You will be sure to see him pass here . " " Ah , " the Judge said again . He looked at her , quizzical , with the blurred eyes of the old . " It 's like this , you see . He always rides the same pony , you say ? " " Why , yes . " She looked at him with grave and tranquil surprise . " And how old would you say the pony is ? " " Why , I . . . It looks just the right size for him . " " A young pony , you would say then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She watched him , her eyes wide . " Ah , " the Judge said again behind his faint still teeth . He closed the briefcase carefully , From his pocket he took a half dollar . " Perhaps he is tired of the soldiers too . Perhaps with this . " Thank you , " she said . She did not look again at the coin . " Your face is so sad . There : when you think you are smiling it is sadder than ever . Are n't you well ? " She glanced down at his extended hand . She did not offer to take the coin . " He 'd just lose it , you see . And it 's so pretty and bright . When he is older , and can take care of small playthings . . . He 's so little now , you see . " " I see , " the Judge said . He put the coin back into his pocket . " Well . I think I shall ? " " You wait here with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . " " Ah , " the Judge said . " On the pony , the same pony . You see , by that token , the pony would have to be thirty years old . That pony died at eighteen , six years unridden , in my lot . That was twelve years ago . So I had better get on . " And again it was quite unpleasant . It should have been doubly so , what with the narrow entrance and the fact that , while the other time he was moving with the crowd , this time he must fight his way inch by inch against it . " But at least I know where I am going , " he thought , beneath his crushed hat , his stick and briefcase dragging at his arms ; " which I did not seem to know before . " But he was free at last , and looking up at the clock on the courthouse , as he never failed to do on descending his office stairs , he saw that he had a full hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready to mark his clocklike passing . " I shall have time to go to the cemetery , " he thought , and looking down at the raw and recent excavation , he swore with fretful annoyance , for some of the savage clods had fallen or been thrown upon the marble slab beside it . " Damn that Pettigrew , " he said . " He should have seen to this . I told him I wanted the two of them as close as possible , but at least I thought that he . . " Kneeling , he tried to remove the earth which had fallen upon the slab . But it was beyond his strength to do more than clear away that which partially obscured the lettering : Howard Allison II . April 3 , 1903 . August 22 , 1913 and the quietly cryptic Gothic lettering at the foot : Auf Wiedersehen , Little Boy . He continued to smooth , to stroke the letters after the earth was gone , his face bemused , quiet , as he spoke to the man who Mothershed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could believe that I should see and touch him again , I shall not have lost him . And if I have not lost him , 1 shall never have had a son . Because I am I through bereavement and because of it . I do not know what I was nor what I shall be . But be- cause of death , I know that I am . And that is all the immortality of which intellect is capable and flesh should desire . Anything else is for peasants , clods , who could never have loved a son well enough to have lost him . " His face broke , myriad , quizzical while his hand moved lightly upon the quiet lettering . " No . I do not require that . To lie beside him will be sufficient for me . There will be a wall of dust between us : that is true , and he is already dust these twenty years . But some day I shall be dusttoo . And ? " he spoke now firmly , quietly , with a kind of triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a web of flesh and bone to hold the shape of love ? " Now it was late . " Probably they are setting their clocks back at this very moment , " he thought , pacing along the street toward his home . Already he should have been hearing the lawn mower , and then in the instant of exasperation at Jake , he remarked the line of motor cars before his gate and a sudden haste came upon him . But not so much but what , looking at the vehicle at the head of the line , he cursed again . " Damn that Pettigrew ! I told him , in the presence of witnesses when I signed my will , that I would not be hauled feet first through Jefferson at forty miles an hour . That if he could n't find me a decent pair of horses . . . I am a good mind to come back and hant him , as Jake would have me do . " But the haste , the urgency , was upon him . He hurried round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was freshly and neatly trimmed , as though done that day ) and entered . Then he could smell the flowers faintly and hear the voice ; he had just time to slip out of his overcoat and pajamas and leave them hanging neatly in the closet , and cross the hail into the odor of cut flowers and the drone of the voice , and slip into his clothes . They had been recently pressed , and his face had been shaved too . Nevertheless they were his own , and he fitted himself to the olden and familiar embrace which no iron could change , with the same lascivious eagerness with which he shaped his limbs to the bedclothes on a winter night . " Ah , " he said to the man who Mothershed had said was Ingersoll , " this is best , after all . An old man is never at home save in his own garments : his own old thinking and be-fiefs ; old hands and feet , elbow , knee , shoulder which he knows will fit . " Now the light vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove for a fading instant down upon him the dreadful macabre smell of slain flowers ; at the same time he became aware that the droning voice had ceased . " In my own house too , " he thought , waiting for the smell of the flowers to fade ; " yet I did not once think to notice who was speaking , nor when he ceased . " Then he heard orfelt the decorous scuffing of feet about him , and he lay in the close dark , his hands folded upon his breast as he slept , as the old sleep , waiting for the moment . It came , He said quietly aloud , quizzical , humorous , peaceful , as he did each night in his bed in his lonely and peaceful room when a last full exhalation had emptied his body of waking and he seemed for less than an instant to look about him from the portal of sleep , " Gentlemen of the Jury , you may proceed .
