Winter Book Number Books That Changed Our Minds IT was BERNARD SMITH who gave us the idea . He had contributed to the revaluations of.American writers that we published in 1936-37 and had been impressed by the series as a whole . He suggested that we should.print a new series of revaluations , in this case dealing with the non-fiction works of the last thirty or forty years that have contributed something new to American thinking ? in other words , the books that have changed our minds . We agreed with him that it was an excellent idea . But no two of us could agree with each other on the books that should be revalued . Everybody was reasonably sure that the series ought to include something by Freud , something by Veblen , something by Beard , something by Dewey . But beyond that point the arguments began , and showed no signs of ending . I was commissioned to write to some of our friends for advice . After describing the project and the difficulties involved in it , I asked , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and in some measure changed the direction of your own thought ? So far the titles most frequently mentioned have been ' The Education of Henry Adams , ' ' The Theory of the Leisure Class , ' ' An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution , " Experience and Nature , ' Main Currents of American Thought , ' ' The Significance of Sections ' ? and among the European books , Sorel 's ' Reflections on Violence , ' Croce 's ' Esthetics , ' Spengler 's ' Decline of the West , ' Freud 's ' Interpretation of Dreams , ' Pareto 's ' Mind and Society , ' and perhaps one of the books by the ' new ' scientists . But what are your suggestions ? " The answers showed that everybody was interested in the problem . In some cases the writer confined himself to the books ? and the magazines , an interesting point ? that had changed his own thinking . In other cases he mentioned the books that seemed to have influenced people about him , his students or colleagues . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common error of people who draw up lists of the " hundred best . " Nobody pretended to have been impressed by books that he thought other people would think that he ought to have been impressed by . They spoke for themselves , and here are their letters . Carl Becker says : " I have a letter from The New Republic which asks me to note any books during the last thirty or forty years which have intines , sri me or influenced my thinking . Undoubtedly many books have influenced my thinking , or at least clarified ideas I already had ( which is about the only way books influence thinking anyway ) . Those I can think of offhand are the following : " Sumner 's ' Folkways , ' which impressed me with the relativity of custom and ideas . Freud 's ' Introduction to PsYchoanalysis , ' which made explicit the notion that the 4h is father to the thought . Valltinger 's ' Ala Oh , ' which came to its in the English tnnslation , ' As If , ' and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by certain unexamined preconceptions current at the time . Whitehead 's ' Science and the Modern World ' and ' Adventures in Ideas ' had the same sort of influence . Croce 's ' History and the Writing of History ' helped to shape my ideas about history , which I set forth in the address ' Everyman His Own Historian . ' " What little I know about the new science has come largely through the popular works of Eddington , ' Whitehead and Bertrand Russell ( the latter 's books on social matters are amusing but superficial ) . Whitehead 's little volume on ' Mathematics ' in the Home University Library I found very useful . John Dewey 's books I find hard to understand , but his ideas , coming to me through other writers , have confirmed a native tendency to pragmatic theory . Warner Fite 's ' Moral Philosophy ' is , I think , the only book on that subject that ever made any impression on me , but that hit the right spot somehow . " I hope this may in some sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Morris R. Cohen says : " The books that have really influenced my thinking must have been very old ones ? classics that one dare not name today without arousing the sneers of the younger generation . In my own field it is often some paper published in a technical journal , e.g. , Einstein 's original paper on Relativity , or Peirce 's paper on Necessity ( in The Monist ) , that exercises the widest and deepest influence . But if I must mention the five most influential books in the history of M. R. C. , I would mention ( for those of the twentieth century only ) : Russell 's Principles of Mathematics ( 1903 ) Poineare 's Science and Hypothesis ( x907 ) Santayana 's Life of Reason ( 1906 ) Gray 's Nature and Sources of the Law ( 1915 ) R. Michel 's The Sociology of Political Parties ( lora ) Thurman Arnold talks about the way that ideas really get into our minds : " I am not a particularly good person , " he says , " to consult on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . I am chiefly interested in editorials , judicial decisions , The Saturday Evening Post , the movies , speeches by university professors , The New Republic , The Nation ? in fact , that stream of current literature which I am trying to analyze to get attitudes of the time . I read them and clip them to the exclusion of almost everything else . Of the titles you mention , I have read only 71re Education of Henry Adams ' and ' The Economic Intetpretation of the Constitution . ' Pareto seemed tome an elaboration of the obvious , so I dropped it after a very cursory examination . Freud 's contributions I have gotten entirely second hand . " Therefore , my own notion of influential boob is based on my guess as to what books have seeped down into popular consciousness . In other words , what literary ideas can find reflected in the mine run of economic , scholarly and legal literature ? My own guess would be that Freud 's notion has been the most influential single thing . Second , Beard 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books you mention . If the others have had any influence at all , I ant unable to see it , and I have been reading current stuff for years with the specific idea in mind of analyzing attitudes . " Among the books you do not mention , I would say that Sinclair Lewis ' ' Main Street ' and ' Babbitt , ' H. L. Mencken 's criticism of the Rotarians , also George Bernard Shaw 's somewhat objective attitude , Thorstein Veblen 's analysis of American business , can all be traced . I do not know what books or plays of Shaw 's or what particular writings of the others I would put first , but you can see all of them there . " I would also add among influential writing The New Republic and The Nation . I have lived in three sections of the country : the Far West , West Virginia and Connecticut , and I have read The Nation and The New Republic consistently during all these years . I can tell what my liberal colleagues are going to say tomorrow by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , periodical literature has been more important than books and there have been more new notions put across by these two publications than any other two in the history of American letters . I forgot Stuart Chase . Certainly there is no small town in the country where someone is not caught by his effective illustrations . " However , I am violating the rules . What you wanted was books . If you have to select single books rather than writers , I am left with only two : first , Freud 's ' Interpretation of Dreams ' and second , Beard 's ' Economic Interpretation of the Constitution . ' No single book of Mencken , Chase or Sinclair Lewis can be listed on a par with these two . I am surprised at the selection of ' The Education of Henry Adams . ' It is a great book , but it is a study in futility and I do not think has had any influence at all in an active , Rotarian and rip-snorting country like ours . " Felix Frankfurter sends a very short list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandeis ' " Other People 's Money " ; Whitehead 's " Science and the Modern World " ; Mr. Justice Holmes 's " Collected Legal Papers . " And he adds , " A grand idea . " Kenneth Burke discusses the same subject as Thurman Arnold , but from the standpoint of belles lettres rather than politics . " Your question , " he says , " led me to wonder how much is done by individual , outstanding books , and how much by a general body of thought . Not some one work that jolts , but a steady pressure , supplied largely by periodicals . In my case , Smart Set , The Little Review , The Egoist , The Seven Arts and The Dial ? all exemplifying , in one way or another , a general code that could be called the ' Esthetic Opposition ' to the norms of business . Behind this , a mixture of psychoanalysis and economics , the interweaving of individual and social psychology one got in Bourne , Brooks , Frank . Now , looking back , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years when the talk of ' pure ' form was at its height " Remy de Gourrnont , who had a way of always seeming loop pleasant things , even when he was saying catastrophic ones . His fertile suggestions about the disso i tion of ideas . ' The essayistic novels of Huysmans , so much more essayl than novelistic that they could legitimately be included here . They led into decadent Latin , of both pagan and evangelical sorts ( and thence into a similar transition from Baudelaire to Rimbaud ) . " I should hate to say so ; but perhaps the biggest jolt I got from a single book in all this period was from Spengler 's ' Untergang des Abendlandes , ' which I read somewhere about 192o ( later making a translation of the ponderous and imposing introduction for The Dial ) . I believe that I have been trying to settle my score with this book ever since . " This bogeyman should be dissipated , I think , by a mixture of Marxism and Ogden 's Library of Philosophy , Psychology and Scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a single work , that strongly affected me ; though I should make exception of Ogden and Richards " Meaning of Meaning ' and Richards ' ' Principles of Literary Criticism . ' The whole , however , is a desert-island collection . That is , I should think of it when answering the questionnaire that runs , ' If you were exiled to an isolated island , and all you could take with you were . . . ' There 'd be ' Shakespeare , the Bible , and the dictionary ' ? and then I 'd begin thinking of Ogden 's library , " Add , for the next phase , ' The Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences . ' At least if one happens to believe that the most relevant thought of the twentieth century will be expended upon attempts at reintegration , and that sociology will assume in this work the role once assumed by metaphysics . But here again , of course , I 'll be cheating , by offering a body of thought , rather than any single monumental work . " Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only two which really impressed me were those of Beard and Farrington . They opened windows for me into the significance of the American tradition as no other books since Tocqueville . Of the others , I was stimulated by Dewey and Freud , but not , I think , in the sense of obtaining new and essential insights as I did from Beard and Farrington . Pareto seemed to me the work of a superior sciolist ; and I have never understood the vogue of Henry Adams ' book ; it is not in the class of Joseph Freeman 's autobiography as an index to the essential America . I should add to your list Hogben 's remarkable book on mathematics . " John Chamberlain mentions seven books : Waldo Frank : Our America Van Wyck Brooks : America 's Coming of Age Randolph Bourne : Untimely Papers Robert M. La Follette 's Autobiography Theodore Dreiser : A Book About Myself William Graham Sumner : Folkways Alfred North Whitehead : Science and the Modem World 9 got jolts from these , primarily , " he says . " Veblen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet on the list . " Granville Hicks writes a long letter : " The idea for the new series is , it seems to me , excellent , in itself more original than the ' revaluations , ' and perhaps likely to be even more revealing and valuable for readers . " I agree that ' The Education of Henry Adams , ' ' The Theory of the Leisure Class , " Att Economic Interpretation of the Constitution , " Main Currents ' and " The Significance of Sections ' belong on the list . Although something of Dewey 's ought to be included , I question Tarrience and Nature , ' It seems to me that he MA &; his:impact with ' Hunan Nature and Conduct . ' " The Mat of the American books that I would add is The Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens . ' Perhaps it is felt that this is too recent Nevertheless , I believe its influence is not only very real but also possible to estimate . The ' Autobiography ' was almost the key book of the depression . I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steffens , and I have myself talked with several score of college students who felt the book had done something to them . Like Henry Adams , Steffens gave people not so much new ideas as a new orientation , but , in even greater degree than Adams 's , his book came at exactly the right moment . " I also remember that Lippirtann 's first two books , Preface to Politics ' and ' Drift and Mastery , ' published the same year , as I recall , had a great influence on me and , I think , on others . I would be inclined to argue that these two hooka , taken together , deserved inclusion . Incidentally , I have pretty good reason to think that many of Lippmann 's ideas , which seemed so original at the time , were actually borrowed from Steffens . So far as I know , this point has never been publicly made , and it might be nice to have it on the record . " Surely you must have considered Croly 's ' Promise of American Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Babbites ' Rousseau and Romanticism . ' None of these books , with the possible exception of Robinson , had much influence on me , but a case could be made for them . A case could also be made for William James 's ' Pragmatism , ' Reed 's ' Ten Days That Shook the World ' and Krutch 's ' The Modern Temper ' ( very influential in the colleges ) . And Bernard Smith and I agreed that it would be almost criminal to omit Woodrow Wilson ? probably a more potent force on our generation than any other one person . Either ' The New Freedom ' or his ' Collected Speeches ' could be considered . " Among the European books , Croce , Spengler and Freud seem to me absolutely necessary . Sorel , as an influence on American thought , is not quite so clear , and I am very dubious indeed about Pareto . Has he as yet had any real influence over here ? " It does seem to me that Lenin ought to be included , probably ' Imperialism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but you can include the book that most of us read before we read ' Capital . ' It is true that Marxist influence has come through many books , not through one , but it ought not be ignored for that reason , " I might add that a very real influence on me was Shaw , though I ca n't point to any one book . " It 's a swell idea . Let me know how it works out . " There are a dozen other letters as interesting as these . We plan to print them next week or the week after , at the same time announcing the books that were eventually chosen for the series . I hope that everybody will disagree with our choke . The books that changed our minds ? yours and mine and John Smith 's ? were not the same books . Otherwise we might have the same minds .
