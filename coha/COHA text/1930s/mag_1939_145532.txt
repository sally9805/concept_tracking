We , the People , a radio program which sells Sanka Coffee , is anybody 's and everybody 's soapbox . Since radio 's No. 1 schmalz*artist , Phillips Lord ( Seth Parker ) , concocted it more than two years ago , about 1,000 human odds and ends have said their pieces during its half-hour broadcasts . An assorted few : Eleanor Roosevelt , Battling Nelson , Don Budge , Mrs. Dutch Schultz , the postmaster of Santa Claus , Ind. , Tom Mooney . <P> The Tom Mooney night was the most celebrated We , the People ever staged , but a certain Mr. X 's six minutes last week provided a new high in schmalz . When tear-jerking Announcer Gabriel Heatter got to Mr. X there was a foggy sob in his voice . " On the afternoon of June 25 , 1931 , " he lamented , " to a hospital in Jackson , Mississippi , police brought a well-dressed man who had collapsed on a city street . . . . Somewhere , somehow the link that bound him to the past had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. X and that man stands beside me tonight . " <P> A quavering , crackerish voice took up the tale : " Today I live at the Mississippi State Hospital in Jackson . Doctors there say I am about 70 years old . ... I am almost bald , and what hair I have is grey . ... I am five feet seven inches tall , and weigh 145 Ibs . My doctor believes I was well educated . . . and I am sure I was once familiar with financial statements . . . . I can identify unusual plants by their botanical names . . . . Also I remember the rules of complicated card games like bridge . " Gradually I have recalled several places where I have been . ... I remember best Pensacola , Florida . I remember a man there who took me to the Osceola Club ... My doctors . . . have decided I was there 30 years ago . I remember very distinctly playing cards with some friends , a druggist and his wife . ... " <P> His voice broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an old man . . . Somehow ... I must find out ... whether I have loved ones who have given me up for dead . ... I do not want to die nameless and alone . . . . " <P> This week Mr. X was back in the hospital at Jackson , where for almost eight years he has puttered in the greenhouse wintering Jackson folks ' plants for small tips , reading geographic magazines , historical novels and the World Almanac . Letters and inquiries by the thousands poured in to We , the People and to the hospital . At least 100 were sure they could identify him . As yet , no one has . <P> Mr. X 's story seemed sound enough , but in its time We , the People has been hoaxed roundly , mostly before Young &; Rubican now the producers , set up their elaborate checking system . Scooty was a Scotti dog , wrote a lady from Elgin , Ill. , which she had come upon accompanying a tin cripple named Tim , hobbling toward Philadelphia to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman wrote that she had taken the dog , promising to give him a good home . Now Scooty knew a few tricks , and she was sure the aunt would let tiny Tim take him back if only Scooty could be allowed to bark to Auntie over the radio . This was just the sort of schmalz We , the People wanted , but when the woman arrived , after due publicity she brought no dog . Suspicion was that there had never been one . But the show went on , with a rented dog who yelped convincingly enough when the sound effects man pulled his tail .
