His father 's name was Noah and his mother 's name was Minerva , but he is merely Judge Edgar Sullins Vaught . Although Noah was a Confederate Veteran and Edgar was born in Virginia , the Judge is a Republican and a habitant of Oklahoma City . He is one of the best toastmasters and storytellers in the State , has been superintendent of Oklahoma City 's schools , president of her Chamber of Commerce , international president of the Lions Clubs . On the Federal bench , to which Calvin Coolidge appointed him in 1928 , Judge Vaught has a reputation for fairness : a big , bluff record which includes life-sentencing the kidnappers of Charles Urschel , bluntly telling a local company to pay no attention to the late NRA , restraining the U. S. from collecting coal taxes under the late Guffey Act . Last week he presided at the trial of Lonzo Carl Giles , onetime Federal Relief administrator in Oklahoma , charged with conspiracy to defraud the Government by countenancing " phony " bids for the purchase of FERA mules . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation requiring competitive bidding Defendant Giles was accused of breaking . Said Judge Vaught critically : " I have investigated here now for nearly a week to find out just exactly what is contained in the first executive order made under the Emergency Relief Act . . . . I also tried to find orders made by the persons to whom the original power was delegated by the President . I could n't find them . I think I have a pretty good library . It is a strange thing if there is a law in the U. S. and we ca n't find out what it is . I want to know what the law is . Where is the regulation ? " <P> Thoroughly wrought-up the Judge exclaimed : <P> " If there ever has been any reckless , careless way of handling Government funds , the evidence in this case certainly shows it . It is not the duty of this court to pass on those matters . It is not interested in them . Here you have seen for yourself the setup where billions of dollars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you say ' go ahead and build your own setup , you go ahead and handle it . ' How you are going to handle it , the Lord only knows . " <P> " I wish to take exception to your honor 's remarks , " said the Government 's attorney meekly . <P> " Well , you can except , " retorted the Judge . <P> Defense attorneys puffed out their chests . <P> Next morning Judge Vaught was half an hour late in appearing at the trial . He promptly addressed the jury : <P> " Gentlemen , in this case some remarks were made by the court yesterday . . . . The remarks were suggested , or rather provoked by the development of the trial . . . . You will appreciate this is an unusual case . It is the first case of its kind I know anything about where a prosecution under an indictment for a violation of a regulation which was promulgated by an executive order has been had . . . . <P> " It was not the court 's intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrator of this Relief fund , either national or State . What the court intended to say was that in the distribution of billions of dollars , certain definite regulations should be provided which would govern those who dispense that sum .
