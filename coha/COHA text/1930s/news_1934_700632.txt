txt By a vote of 12 to 4 the Board of Estimate branch of the Municipal Assembly defeated yesterday the compulsory city residence bill for city employes introduced several weeks ago by Borough President James J. Lyons of the Bronx . In voting against the Lyons measure , the Mayor forecast his veto of the ordinance passed last Tuesday by the Board of Aldermen , which also requires residence in the city as a qualification for holding a city position . The Lyons measure was not so drastic as that offered by Alderman Edward J. Sullivan in the Board of Aldermen . The Lyons bill would force all city employes and officials to move into the city by Jan. 1 next . In arguing for it yesterday the Bronx official made several remarks which brought retorts from the Mayor and Aldermanic President Bernard S. Deutsch . " I believe there is a citizen In New York entitled and competent to fill every position from Mayor right down to laborer , " Mr. Lyons said . " This bill was one that you , Mr. Mayor , agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after conference with you and it contains amendments suggested by you . Leaves a Loophole , He Says . " It does not affect the foreign commissioners appointed by you , provided they become immigrants . It will even permit you to appoint more foreigners , provided twothirds of each branch of the Municipal Assembly concur in the . necessity . The more drastic bill pissed by the other body may well have been enacted because of our dilatory action on this reasonable measure , which you indicated you would favor . " Good faith in the passage of this bill may influence the other body to be less drastic , and they then may not pass their ordinance over your likely veto . If some of the foreign commissioners have caused you to change , I suppose that the independent members of this board who say ' ditto ' to you : vote will continue to do so , and in that case I might just as well have this bill killed right hare in the open as to have it die of sleeping sickness . " ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deutsch . " I am just as independent as you are , and I vote according to the dictates of judgment and conscience . Mr. Mayor , I resent that remark . " " The President of the Bronx sometimes " votes with the Mayor , " said Mayor LaGuardia . " I said ' voted with you in every instance , ' " Mr. Lyons retorted . Fusion Votes Solidly . On the roll-call Borough Presidents Samuel Levy of Mannattan and George U. Harvey of Queens voted with Mr. Lyons for the bill . The Fusion majority of twelve.votes went solidly against it . After the vote , Mr. Lyons kept prodding members of the Fusion bloc . When Mr. Deutsch explained that Maurice P. Davidson , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , was too busy to report on ? a possible decrease in water rates , Mr. Lyons said : " Yes , he 's busy ; busy organizing clubs . " This reference to Mr. Davidson 's activity on behalf of Fusion last Fall nettled ? Mr. Deutsch , and he protested . Shortly afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unanimity of the Fusion contingent . Mr. Lyons apologized , and invited his colleagues to a luncheon on June 15 celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of Bronx County . While the Mayo- and Mr. Deutsch . were accepting the invitation , Barough President Raymond V. Ingersoll of Brooklyn said : " The Borough President always apologizes in advance and makes nasty cracks afterward . " " Well , I 'm always glad to apologize , " said Mr. Lyons .
