txt The British Labor Government 's solution of the present financial difficulties of the country is to increase the rates of the income tax , supertax and death duties to such an extent that the added revenue from these three sources for the remainder of the current year will amount to about $157 , - 000,000 , and for the next full year to $217,000,000 . The only other proposed increase in income is to be derived from an added . beer tax of 2 cents a gallon , which brewers say will not be passed on to the consumers , and which will yield $17,500,000 . The only direct tax removed is that on horse-race bookmakers , which means a loss of only about $1,000,000 annually . The recent Conservative Government 's safeguarding dr protective duties , most of which lapse this year , will not be renewed , but . the tariff , which yields a revenue of $50,000,000 , chiefly on imported automobiles , will be continued Anti/ the Exchequer is in a stronger position . It is estimated that the surplus at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing for expenditures of approximately $4,000 , - 000,000 for all running expenses of the government and for the national debt . Something over $1,500,000,000 of this total goes for debt payments , chiefly due to the World War . Such , in brief , is an outline of the long-awaited budget which Philip Snowden , Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Government , presented to the House of Commons today . Excitement in Downing Street . Budget day in England is almost as popular and exciting as is the custom to present boiled-down summaries of the abstruse financial calculations in such tangible , elemental fashion that the rich man knows immediately how much more he will have to pay in supertaxes and the poor man knows at a glance what , if any , change there is going to be in the price of his bread , beer , tea and coffee . It is not merely that everybody has a personal stake in the matter , but everybody realizes that fact . So Mr. Snowden was awaited and cheered by E. big crowd in front of his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received with an ovation when he entered the House of Commons carrying an old red leather case in which budgets have been transported since the days of Gladstone . A Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod removed the mace from the table to indicate that the House was about to sit as a committee of the whole to hear the annual financial message . No matter what it may do with taxes , England never abates anything of ancient tradition and ritual . Present Situation Reviewed . Mr. Snowden began with a review of the country 's present financial situation , In which he reiterated the familiar statement that his task was difficult because Winston Churchill , Chancellor of the Exchequer in the last Conservative Government , had " raided " various funds and left a deficit of $80,000,000 . Not only Mr. Churchill but four other members of Parliament who are former Chancellors of the Exchequer were on the Opposition benches taking notes and preparing for criticism in the budget debates to come . Every seat was taken and many members were there as early as 7 o'clock this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Governor of the Bank of England , was in the distinguished visitors ' gallery . On the whole comment after adjournment was favorable , the chief Tory criticism being that , by adding to the income tax , the government was injuring industry by diverting so much more from business investments . The extreme ? Left Wing radicals of Mr. Snowden 's own party complained that he had been too moderate and regretted that he had not increased the income and supertaxes by five times as much . The Liberals thought it as good a budget as possible under existing circumstances , but regretted that Mr. Snowden had not seen his way clear to add a tax on land values . However , he has promised that as a later measure but could not depend on that source for immediate revenue as an elaborate process of valuation of lands is necessary first . Early Legislation Promised . Mr. Snowden promises to introduce legislation to that effect at an early date . He also assured the House of Commons that in his opinion , unless there are unforeseen circumstances , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . That assurance , too , was resented by the Radicals , wig() complain that there was not enough increase this year . " Hurry and spend all your money before you die or Snowden will get it in death taxes , " said a fellow Conservative member to Lady Astor in the lobby after adjournment . " Oh , I believe in big death taxes , " replied Lady Astor. " and this is not a bad budget , at all . It is not Socialism . It is just a good Liberal budget . " In commenting on the reduction of the appropriation for the army and navy , Mr. Snowden said : " These cuts are not so big as I would have had them . It is deplorable that twelve years after the war and in view of all the peace pacts , we and other powers are spending so much on armaments , preparing for another possible war . " Standard Increase 12 Cents . The increase In the standard income tax is six pence , about 12 cents , on the pound , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 pence , or about $1.12 on $5 of income . But this increase , explained Mr. Snowden , will affect not more than one-quarter of the 2,225,000 English men and women who have incomes large enough to be taxed . There will be no increase for single persons with incomes less than $2,500 and for married persons with chil1 dren whose incomes are less ? than $4,000 . In other words , the wealthier English taxpayers must bear the I whole brunt of the new increase . It is misleading , said Mr. Snowden , for the English people to harp on the fact that they are taxed four shillings on every pound of income . That is the standard rate , but because of exemptions and gradations in the system , not more than 50,000 persons actually pay at that rate . The vast majority pay only from one to two shillings . The rate now proposed by Mr. Snowden is four times as much as before the war , but from the last year of the war until 1922 the rate was $1.50 on . $5 of income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate will start at 25 cents instead of 18 cents on every $5 above an income of $10,000 . There is a gradual increase all the way tip , with the supertax on incomes of $250,000 and over at a rate which works out in American money at about $375 tax on every $1,000 of income above $250,000 . The death or estate duties will increase on all fortunes above $600,000 by gradual advances above the present rates , and hereafter all estates valued at $10,000,000 or more will be taxed at 50 instead of the present rate of 40 per cent . Mr. Snowden also said he would soon introduce legislation to prevent the avoidance of death duties by the present device of forming private holding companies . " In making this budget , " Mr. Snowden ' said in conclusion , " I have placed burdens on the shoulders best able to bear them . I have placed no direct tax on industry and have not taken from the poorest of the land any part of their inadequate means . This new taxation does not mean deprivation of necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anybody . I am merely asking that a favored section of the community shall contribute to the needs of the State in proportion to the benefits which the State has conferred on them . " The standard rates of Income tax since 1908 have been as follows : 1908 , 24 cents on $5. 1910 , 28 cents on $5. 1915 , 40 cents on $5. 1916 , 72 cents on $5. 1917 , $1120 on $5. 1919 , $1.44 on $5. 1923 , $1.20 on S5. 1924 , $1.08 on $5. 1926 , 96 cents on $5. 1931 , proposed $1.12 on $5.
