Last October 28 a German astronomer , Dr. Karl Reinmuth of Heidelberg , noticed a faint white streak against the dark background of an astronomical photograph . A similar streak was discovered on a plate exposed at Johannesburg in South Africa . Such streaks reveal small , comparatively nearby objects moving across the sky at high speeds as contrasted with the relatively fixed positions of the stars . This wanderer , christened " Object Reinmuth 1937 U. B. , " appeared to be several miles in diameter. * Its orbit was calculated from the streaks . Last week , after all danger was past , Johannesburg astronomers announced that in October the earth had had its narrowest escape from collision with a celestial body of such size in astronomical history . <P> At its closest approach " Object Reinmuth " sped within 400,000 miles of Earth , which is less than twice the distance of the moon . Collision with one of these small planets or asteroids which lope around the solar system is a perennial theme with lurid fictionists , but mathematical chances against the occurrence are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a body the size of ' ' Object Reinmuth " struck this globe it would not only annihilate everything at the site of impact but cause a tremendous earthquake and fires which would destroy life and property hundreds of miles away . If it fell into the sea , ships would be smashed and coast lines inundated by mighty tidal waves . When a newshawk asked Dr. Harry Edwin Wood of Johannesburg last week what would have happened if " Object Reinmuth " had landed on Earth , he answered with wry circumspection : " It might conceivably have altered the international situation somewhat . " <P> <P> - The symbols " U. B. " serve to identify the object in the series of asteroids discovered during the year .
