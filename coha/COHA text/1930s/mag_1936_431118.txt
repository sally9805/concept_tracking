 | Small Town IN a newspaper office in a Western town of 17,000 population , forty years ago , sat three young men discussing an editorial by Edward Bok in his Ladies ' Home Journal . Bok deplored the tendency of young people to set out for the nearest big city to make their start in life , and stressed the advantages of the small town both as a place to work and as a place to live . The young men voted , Very good , Edward , ' and wrote him a joint letter to that effect , explaining that they were publishing a small-town daily and getting a lot of fun out of it , and proposed to see it through and carve out their destinies , if any , in the old home town . Two years later those three young men were settled down to their lifework in New York . One became a publisher , another a banker , and the third an advertising man . They prospered after a fashion , experienced varied fortunes , but within fifteen years were successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York , and after another fifteen years to move to the actual country fifty to a hundred miles away , spending long week-ends there during the summer . Two of those men are now dead , but the third lives on a modernized abandoned farm six months out of the year , surrounding himself as far as possible with the environment his boyhood knew : earth , trees , grass , horizons ? the things he thought he hated when he @# shook from his feet the dust of his native town . When business compels him to visit the city , he escapes back to the country with a long sigh of relief . The country to which he now escapes is no substitute for the town he abandoned forty years ago . Here he is but one of a number of summer denizens , an alien in a New England community , with no background , no roots , no integral part in the local life . His being there at all is an instinctive response to the call of the earth which is dormant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in mowing the lawn , milking the cow , and spading the garden . Those hated chores of boyhood become the recreations of later years , but they do not entirely recapture the no doubt fanciful glamour which surrounds his youth . Such is the case history of many an inhabitant of the big city ; or , if his means are straitened , he spends fifty weeks in a narrow fiat with two weeks in the country as a vacation . Those who boast two homes lead strenuous double lives , traveling long distances daily or weekly for the satisfaction of seeing something besides brick and mortar and asphalt . They are not city-born , nor in a real sense city-bred . They came hither to seek their fortunes because of the legend which still persists that opportunities here are greater and more numerous . Let a young man have a gift or aptitude , or even a dash  | of ambition , and he feels that remaining in the small town which nourished him is hiding his talent in a napkin . When George Ade was asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't they ? ' he answered , Yes , and the brighter they are , the sooner they come . ' And George Ade , who certainly had his hour in the bright lights of Broadway , now lives on his Indiana farm . One result of this obsession , this naive belief in the chances fortune affords in the big city , has been to divide the country into metropolises and home towns , though the line can not be drawn sharply . One man 's metropolis is another man 's village . It is not always New York the young adventurers seek , each with an industrial captain 's baton concealed in his knapsack , nor even Chicago . It may well be Denver , or Cleveland , or St. Louis . All that is necessary is that the city shall be appreciably larger than the seeker 's present domicile . It is merely the lure of the new and strange contrasted with the known and commonplace ; the escape from I knew him when . . We have all experienced the difficulty of growing up , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants have known us from birth , where we are still Clint Calkins 's little boy Ernie , even after we have reached voting age . But there is more to this tendency big-city-ward than desire to escape from boyhood environment . The young people believe the metropolis bristling with opportunities , that their talents , unappreciated at home , will be quickly recognized abroad ? and this also is sometimes true . The big city does have more opportunities than the small one , and more successes , just as it has more failures , more has-beens , more dullards and plodders , for the simple reason that it has more people of all kinds . It is likewise crowded with young @# hopefuls seeking that mysterious and elusive something known as ' opportunity . ' The chances are relatively no greater , the rewards relatively no more satisfying ; and , if attained , they seem to lead in the long run back to the country . All my business life I have answered letters from aspiring men and women who sound me out as to the wisdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . Their home is a small town , they urge , and does not offer any opportunity . Patiently I explain that advertising is one of our most widely distributed commodities , that the work can be done wherever men sell goods , that if they have any aptitude for it they can start where they are . And this advice holds good for medicine , salesmanship , architecture , dentistry , or newspaper editing . The spell of the great city has broadcast a glamour that is far from real , and at the same time given life in the small town a drabness that is equally undeserved . The small-town hick , ' the country rube , ' are as rare as the city slicker . ' None of them ever existed in a statistical sense . They are literary figures . They are states of mind which are found everywhere , in the big cities as well as the smallest hamlets , exactly as the shrewd manof-the-world type is found everywhere . There are vacuous bumpkins living in New York , Boston , and San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban , whose manners are urbane , who have culture , worldly wisdom , savoir-faire , polish ? whatever it is that bumping against one 's fellows in big cities is supposed to impart . It is n't riding in the subway , or seeing the Empire State Building , or struggling with the crowd on Fortysecond Street , that makes a man largeminded . That merely develops the special skill of coping with crowds , just  | as cultivating the soil develops weather wisdom . After all , it is as broad as it is long . The boulevardier cuts no better figure in a cornfield than the farmer on Broadway . If there was ever real ground for the sharp differentiation between town and country it disappeared before the equalizing influence of improved communication and transportation . Thanks to the radio , people now speak as sloppy English in the country as in the city ; the movie tells them what clothes to wear , and they wear them . The ubiquitous motor is congesting traffic on Main Street as well as State Street . The farmer who walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every confidence man in sight , is part of folklore . He is more apt to drive his Cadillac up to the Waldorf or the La Salle . It is an ancient and honorable controversy , the argument over the comparative advantages and disadvantages of town and country living . The dispute is as old as literature , probably as old as towns . AEsop had something to say about it , and Horace was deeply concerned as he weighed the dust and noise of the arena against the peace and quiet of his Sabine farm . La Fontaine did it into a fable , which to my surprise I found was about rats , though the literary allusions are always to The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse . ' At any rate , the moral is that , while there is greater abundance of food in the city , in the country one eats in quiet and safety . But , on the other hand , those two inveterate cockneys , Dr. Johnson and Charles Lamb , saw no charm in country life . Johnson thought the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question has been given what advertising men call a new slant ' in recent years by the changes that inventions have made in modes and manners , and needs to be reconsidered on a fresh basis . II When , a few years ago , I attended the fortieth reunion of my class at a Western college and met the classmates and contemporaries I had not seen since our common youth , I was struck by the fact that there was no essential difference between those who had passed their lives in small towns and those of the same estate whom I had known in New York ? none , that is , in dress , speech , manner , or way of living that set them off as having missed something essential . On the contrary , many of the small-town magnates seemed to have had a fuller , richer , more satisfying existence than their counterparts in the populous cities . These were naturally the successful men of their communities , though for that matter failure , while less conspicuous , is no more bearable in urban than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who elected to remain in small towns , preferring , as the old proverb has it , to be first in a Nubian village rather than second in Rome . These are the men who might have gone to the big towns and been proportionately successful there . They had worked out their careers in towns having from thirty thousand inhabitants down to as few as five thousand . They were farmers , bankers , doctors , lawyers , merchants , manufacturers . They were small-town men , but they did not seem to have smalltown minds . They got about ; they knew men ; they were interested in large enterprises ; they had had varied experiences . Some of them were trustees of the college . All had connections , social and business , with other towns , other states . After leaving college , some had gone East for postgraduate work or professional training , and returned to start in the home town ; others took over the paternal bank or store or factory . They married , had  | children and grandchildren , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel he had chosen unwisely . Their lives were as full , as gracious , as satisfying , apparently , as lives anywhere . Success , of course , is measured by various yardsticks , but a work that satisfies , ample material return , and a pleasant environment cover what most of us desire . The last is the most important , for there is no doubt that a man can make as good a living in a small town as his ability can achieve ; the doubt lies in whether the living , when made in such an environment , is worth while . There was one man at this college reunion who might stand as an extreme example , for the town where he lived boasted less than five thousand people ? what is known as a tank town , ' where through trains do not stop ( a negligible deprivation in these days of motor cars ) , where picturesque characters are supposed to gather around the grocery stove ( the chain stores have put a stop to all that ) ; an ordinary small Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scenery , or architecture ; not a show town or model city , but a town that has been conditioned by a hundred years of pleasant , not-too-hectic living . A good satirist could make it sound hick ' with a few strokes of the pen . Martin Leigh is the banker of that town , the only banker . After graduating from the fresh-water college , he had his year at Harvard , and then entered the family bank , established by his grandfather , a pioneer on the prairies . Though the town is small , it is the trading centre of a large farming community , which means it has shared the ups and downs of agriculture ; but , despite moratoriums , bank holidays , and farm mortgages , the bank is sound and solvent . Leigh 's home is a roomy , rambling , @# and comfortable structure , enlarged to accommodate a growing family and different conceptions of social needs . Its wide lawn is now covered with stately old trees , and there is a vegetable garden , and charming flower gardens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather one maid and a strong woman by the day , ' do the housework , but that does not preclude the mistress from taking a hand , as she is well qualified to do , and thus linking her domestic life more closely with that of her neighbors ' simpler homes , for one of the amenities of small-town life is the limit public opinion sets on show-off . ' There are men in each of these little communities who have the means to splurge in domestic establishments , ? butlers , livery , uniformed chauffeurs , ? but the native good sense of the community , the persistence of the pioneer ideal , keeps them on a plane little above that of their neighbors , and life is , simple and wholesome , with much income saved . In Leigh 's home have been entertained people of note in public affairs , in letters , and in business . He himself mixes in politics a bit , has represented his state in national conventions , and takes a decent interest in the governing of the small town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family travel widely and people come long distances to see them . Chicago is but a hundred miles distant , over the straightest , smoothest , and fastest roads in this country , and Leigh drives to the big city to attend board meetings and is home in time for dinner , which most of the townfolk call supper . All the family go up for opera , concerts , plays ( though the movie is effacing that diversion ) , as well as dinners , parties , and other social affairs , giving them all the metropolitan life they need or desire . One attraction of the small town is that it justifies the motor car , which  | congestion in the big cities has practically nullified . In the small town one starts the ride from the front gate . In five minutes he is in open country , instead of spending the first and last hours of a drive threading congested purlieus . A car is hardly needed for the daily rounds in so small a place . The bank and business quarters are but five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic arch overhead . There is a large garage on the home place , a car for nearly every member of the family , and no bills for storage . The cars are washed and kept in order by the useful man who milks the cow , mows the lawn , and takes care of the gardens . He can drive when necessary , but does not wear a uniform , a peaked cap being the only concession to the change of status from hired man to chauffeur . In ten minutes by car Leigh can be on the links of an eighteen-hole golf course ( dues twenty dollars a year ) , beside a winding artificial lake created in the dimples of the rolling prairie , its simple clubhouse the centre of much entertaining . Simple , we say ? but that does not preclude cocktail parties , pajamas and shorts , or barebacked sun-bathing . The fads , follies , and fashions of supposedly more favored resorts are all found in these small towns for those who want them , but one advantage is that they are not compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar privileges and environment in a big city . Isolated small towns are self-contained , make their own standards of living , and set the price as well as the pace . Not only are the necessities of life cheaper , but there is no occasion for some expenditures that the city renders imperative ? transportation , for instance , with its steady outlay of nickels , dimes , and half dollars for subway , bus , and taxi ; no constant call for tipping , no thirty-five dollars a TOWN 231 month for car storage . But Leigh 's clothes are made in Chicago , his wife 's dresses in New York , and sometimes in Paris ; his children , after graduating from the local college , attend Eastern universities . It is a safe bet that $25,000 a year in the small city will buy as much of living as $100,000 in New York , discounting the so-called greater opportunities ? provided living in the small town is at least as satisfying as living in the metropolis . Of course Leigh is exceptional in his own town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town has its quota of such men . In the gathering I spoke about there were at least a dozen small-town business men whose names are in Who 's Who , ? from towns such as Madison , Wisconsin ; Elgin , Illinois ; Oberlin , Ohio , ? who seemed more than content . Certainly they showed no curiosity about New York . As a matter of fact , they knew it as well as I , who have lived there forty years . The big city was ably represented by Jack Basset , who might almost serve as a symbol of the country boy who wins a fortune in the big city . Son of a Methodist minister , he grew up in the small town where the college was situated . On graduation he went to New York , took up banking , and in time found his metier . More manufacturer than banker , he became an expert in a specialized field growing out of our complicated economic system ? that of nursing sick businesses . He has a genius for pulling factories out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over such an industry he was put in charge , and just now he is president of a large corporation with offices in New York and ramifications elsewhere . He has a small but perfectly ordered apartment in New York , where he spends five days a week , but his legal residence is a five-hundred-acre fancy farm in the 232 THE ATLAN7  | Berkshires , with bathing pool , trout stream , pedigreed cattle , and cages of pheasants , which requires the services of twenty-eight men to keep it presentable for the brief survey its owner is able to give it . To reach his farm , ' Jack rides a hundred miles by train and twenty by motor , every week , for the sake of forty-eight hours in the country . The place is well worth the trip , but one can not help feeling he gets little out of it at the expense of considerable time and trouble , that he could have it every day if his factory and offices were near at hand , as they might easily be , ? New England is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement for country living would have sufficed to satisfy the instinct to return to the land . It is doubtful if he gets more pleasure out of his elaborate place , especially when you consider how little he sees of it , than Martin Leigh does out of his less pretentious home . The other day the editor of a small country weekly in upper New York received a classified advertisement which piqued his curiosity . A lawyer announced he would be in certain neighboring towns on certain days prepared to give legal advice , and in his home town , a small village , on other days . The editor investigated and got a good story . The advertiser was a successful New York lawyer who had deliberately abandoned a promising city practice and settled in the small town with the intention of building a second career in that unpromising territory , for the sake of giving his sons the advantage , which had been his as a boy , of living in the country . The heritage of small-town memories which so many Americans possess is something for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , a big city is a barren waste beside the , unfailing attractions and diversions of the country . @# Emporia has given William Allen White all the background he needed to become a national figure . It was as a lover of his native soil that he wrote the ringing editorial , What 's the Matter with Kansas ? ' ? and he did not belie his faith by running off to New York when his words set a nation talking . Emporia made White , but White has put Emporia on the map . He has pictured small-town life in In Our Town with all its warmth and color and humanness . But more convincing still is his continued satisfaction with life in Emporia . He does n't just write about it . He lives it . III But enough of the material side . It is obvious that practically everything which can be bought with money is as accessible to the small-towner as to the big-city man . The deeper satisfactions of life in small cities or large villages lie elsewhere ? in nature and human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in us that demands contact with elemental forces ? earth , sky , wind , sun . There is a philosophy that comes from nearness to the land , tilling the soil , caring for animals , coping directly and at first hand with nature . Outdoor men , farmers , cowboys , shepherds , sailors , hunters , engineers , have it . I often felt it in my boyhood in the farmers that I knew , strong , quiet , thoughtful men . The earth does things to you ? the smell of freshly turned sod , the sun on the back of your neck , running water , the tremendous systole and diastole of nature , giving each month . of the round a significance ; in the city they are but names on a calendar . The Greeks put the idea neatly in the legend of Antaus , whose strength was renewed by contact with Mother Earth . The only way Hercules could LY SMALL  | overcome him was to get him off his feet . The small town is still linked to the soil . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city it so mistakenly emulates . Its people are still aware of the procession of the seasons , seedtime and harvest , sunrise and sunset , the night and its stars , which for the city dweller ? his earth plated with concrete , his sky narrowed by brick canyons ? have almost ceased to exist . But the best thing about a small town is the people who live in it . I say this boldly , knowing how often that element is seized upon as a subject for ridicule ? their dullness , banality , narrow lives and interests . The point is that the indictment simply is not true . There are such people and such conditions in small towns , just as there are in large cities , for the human race is plentifully supplied with all kinds ; they average about the same everywhere . The inhabitants of the small town are no worse and no better than people everywhere , but in the small town you know them , as friends , neighbors , acquaintances , over a long span of years , lifetimes often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sobering but an inspiring thought . In the small town you do not need to pretend ; you can be yourself . This may irk some minds , who will prefer the anonymity of the big city , but to a normal person there is something heartening in being an integral part of a community . Be sure of this : if you find the small town dull , the lack is in you . You no doubt bore the people . Neighborliness ! That is the touchstone of the small town . Our common , ingrained humanity finds expression and overleaps mere social distinctions . The girl in the Western Union office rejoices audibly over the good news we are telegraphing , and condoles with us over a misfortune . She goes to our TOWN 233 Sunday school . The carpenter and painter take a friendly interest in their work , with none of that slapdash indifference of city artisans , here today and gone to-morrow , and they do odd jobs for you not countenanced by their unions . The old postman sits down in your porch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tells you he is sorry there is no letter from Betty this week ? Betty being your married daughter who lives in Texas . The postman has known her from babyhood , when she used to sit on the gatepost waiting for the mail ; now she has daughters of her own . One is surrounded by this warm , friendly , genuine interest which is neither prying nor curiosity , which does not fail in times of trouble . It is the thing country folk miss most in large cities . The neighborliness of the small town is an honest tradition from pioneer days when the early settlers changed work ' and helped one another with bees and house-raisings , as is done still among farmers at threshing time . The neighborly exchange of simple social life , from porch to porch , over the back fence , the casual daily meetings on Main Street , still go on , but they are accompanied now in even the smallest places by social functions which differ little from the same festivities in large cities . Besides qualifying for the smalltown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and worth knowing for their own sakes . There are characters distinguished for culture , achievement , experience , and personality far more individual than if their corners had been rubbed off by the friction of metropolitan life . In a big city you might see such famous people , but in the small town , if you are worthy , you are privileged to know them . They are part of the life of the town , dramatis personae of the play for which you have a reserved seat .  | I recall such people in a town of less than 30,000 , men and women ? a Latin teacher who was a gifted conversationalist , a cobbler whose astute socialist arguments dismayed smug reactionary business men , an editor who in his leisure hours became an authority on the geology of the state , a Catholic priest who was the best of good companions , a lawyer whose library was a collection of rare first editions . Stories , each one of them . To know them was an experience , an adventure in friendship . One is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as a whole , in all its relations , instead of such detached segments as impinge on one 's consciousness from the milling crowds of a great city . You may thus behold , if you live long enough , the span of five successive generations ? births , marriages , and deaths , the vagaries of heredity , the changing fortunes in human lives . I recall in my boyhood a stern bearded man , son of the first pioneer of our village . I knew his son and his grandson , and , did I still live there , I should now know that grandson 's grandson , and such experiences are repeated for other family strains . The lives of such dynasties constitute books , books read with a touch of nostalgia by detached floating human elements living in big cities . There is as much romance , adventure , drama , tragedy , in any small town as in any similar-sized group in a large city . For one to whom a human being is the most interesting animal in the world , there is unfailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing panorama of life in a small town . What is often disparaged as the gossip of a small town is its most vital quality ? interest in human history . After all , what is the difference between the country-wide interest in the marital adventures of Barbara Hutton , or the struggle for possession of Gloria @# Vanderbilt , and the same curiosity , tempered in this case by friendly interest , regarding the marriage of Mame Littleton of our town , whose birth notice in the local sheet we read , it seems , just the other day , whose father and mother are our friends and neighbors , whose grandfather we looked up to with awe as children as one of the rude forefathers of the hamlet ' ? The county correspondence in country newspapers comes in for a good deal of joshing , ' with its grist of seemingly trivial social affairs , but what essential difference is there between those paragraphs and the items in the society column of a metropolitan newspaper ? Small towns have culture , often in greater degree , relatively , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi Valley ( and elsewhere , too ) ? Oberlin , Marietta , Jacksonville , Galesburg , to name but a few ? with a high I. Q. The public library at Galesburg , is one of the best in Illinois . The use of books there during the depression roseto 16.7 per capita a year , which librarians will tell you is a high score . Nor is that due to the presence of Knox College , for the students have their own unusually complete library . There are some fine libraries in homes , and many books and magazines in others , study clubs which really function , ? the two best have met continuously for forty years , ? musical societies , little theatres , all the paraphernalia of culture . Forty years ago a discerning French journalist , Madame Therese Bentzon of the Revue des Deux Mondes , wrote of one of those prairie college towns : ? We visit the town , which is charming with its shady avenues and its verdant boulevards . It covers a vast extent , trees and gardens occupying much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a few mercantile streets , but they are quietly busy , as befits a town where trade is only a secondary matter ,  | @# which has never cared for anything but religion and learning . The elegant quarter is filled with very pretty middle-class houses , mostly of painted wood , but of every architectural style . Lawns encircle them ; they seem to be scattered over a meadow . The entire town is scrupulously neat . .. . Am invited to several houses in the town , where I find the best of company ? women simple , and at the same time well informed , talking on all subjects and asking intelligent questions . Evidently contact with the college is a constant stimulus , and the society of the professors a precious resource . Some have traveled , but they are not possessed by that feverish desire for change which I have remarked elsewhere , nor is there any trace of pretense or affectation ? which is restful . The diversity of religious denominations in this little town , which is so devout as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , and motor car , the town has changed ; some of its peace and quiet have vanished ; it is bigger , noisier , more crowded , but its inner life is much as Madame Bentzon saw it . And there are many such in that great plain between the Alleghanies and the Rockies . If I have inclined too strongly toward the Middle West , it is only partly because I know it best , but more logically because that region is the heart of the United States . The towns are widely scattered , each the centre of its own broad farming land , TOWN 235 hence isolated and self-contained ; less overshadowed by big cities , and able to lead its own life and develop its own individuality . These towns are the projection of a recent pioneer impulse , and many of them are less than one hundred years from virgin prairie . But the thesis holds good for small towns in other sections of the country , the East and the far West , provided they have not sold their birthright for a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to-day look best and reveal a charm and inviting prospect which few factory towns have yet learned to acquire . The small towns are our greatest asset . It is time we took stock of them , those middle-sized , middle-class , bourgeois burgs which it is so easy to mock , though few who have lived there have escaped their charm and amenity . A wistful , longing for them has built up a flourishing business in New York , selling out-of-town newspapers . The movement toward decentralization already under way , which made Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building obsolete before they were completed , will give them new significance . God made the country , ' says the proverb , and the devil made the city . ' Between God 's country and the devil 's city is the small town , combining the best features of both .
