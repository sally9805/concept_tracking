MOVERS AND SHAKERS-Mabel Dodge Luhan-Harcourt , Brace ( $5 ) . <P> During the last four years a wealthy , 56-year-old grandmother , living in the peaceful seclusion of her New Mexican ranch , has published three books that belong with the most scandalous of contemporary autobiographies . Creator of these solemnly indiscreet records is Mabel Dodge Luhan , patroness of art , friend of D. H. Lawrence and of other literary great , wife of a Taos Indian whose folkways she recounted in Winter in Taos . The scandalous books are the successive volumes of her Intimate Memories . This is a long manuscript , about which lurid literary legends are steadily accumulating . It now reposes in the safe of Publishers Harcourt and Brace and is not to be published in its entirety until Mabel Dodge Luhan has been dead for 25 years . Meanwhile with each publication the author 's selections from her memories grow longer and more intimate , revolve around more eminent personages in more unconventional situations , until they now total 1,278 closely-printed pages of documentation on a dissatisfied , determined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional misadventures as recollected in aged tranquillity . <P> The first volume told of Mabel Dodge 's unhappy childhood in a prosperous Buffalo family and of schoolgirlish infatuations In the U. S. and France . Second , European Experiences ( TIME , Sept. 30 , 1935 ) told of her first two marriages , of establishing a meeting-place for adventurous spirits in her villa in Florence , included droll accounts of how she almost had love affairs with an Italian chauffeur , a British officer , as well as with poets , painters and poseurs of varied talent . Written with a queer sort of frozen-faced malice that did not reveal what the author thought of the highbrow foolishness she observed , the memoirs presented their central character as at once high-strung and imperturbable , gushy but shrewd , a celebrity-hunter , falling for all manner of artistic fakers but preserving a strong streak of hard-headed commonsense . Her European experiences , which ended as she returned to the U. S. filled with dread for the " ugly " future , were of the " not quite " variety-she was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close to killing herself .
