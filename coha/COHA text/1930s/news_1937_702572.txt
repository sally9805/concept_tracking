txt George A. Ball , glass manufacturer of Muncie , Ind. , who bought control of a $3,000,000,000 railway and real estate empire at a creditors ' sale on Vesey Street in 1935 for a little more than $3,000,000 , announced yesterday that this control had been sold to two members of a New York Stock Exchange firm and a director of a Wilkes-Barre bank for an undisclosed price . The atmosphere in which Mr. Ball made this announcement was in contrast to the surroundings in which he bought control of the empire as a result of a $40,000,000 loan default by the late O. P. and M. J. Van Sweringen , Cleveland promotors . The group of banks headed by J. P. Morgan &; Co. which sold the control of the empire in default of the $40,000,000 obligation took the loss on the transaction in the old auction rooms of Adrian H. Muller &; Son , at 18 Vesey Street , known in the financial district as the " securities graveyard . " These rooms are opposite the graveyard of St. Paul 's Chapel . Deal Revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a reception in the Waldorf-Astoria aHotel . Representatives of the Van Sweringen interests and the buyers were among those in attendance . The buyers were Robert R. Young and Frank F. Kolbe , partners in the New York Stock Exchange firm of Young , Kolbe &; Co. , and Allan P. Kirby of Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , son of a founder of the F. W. Woolworth Company . Messrs . Young and Kolbe have acted as agents for large investors , have sought no small accounts and therefore are one of the lesserknown firms in Wall Street . Mr. Kirby is virtually unknown in Wall Street . Although the three buyers of the Ball holdings have acquired nominal control of 28,000 miles of railroad ? a system surpassed in extent only by the government-owned units of Russia and Germany  --  all disclaimed knowledge of railroad operation in response to questioning yesterday . They made it clear , however , that they hoped changes in the stock market would bring to their investment a measure of the value it held in the days before the crash of 1929 . Securities Valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball was estimated inrthe light of current market quotations at from $8,000,000 to $10,000,000  --  a computation based on the hypothesis that these instruments would find a cash purchaser without lowering their price . The actual amount of cash involved in the transaction was said to be " substantial . " The remainder of the price is understood to be covered by promises to pay and other considerations . The transfer was accomplished through the medium of holding companies , the operations of which in the railroad field are now under investigation by a committee headed by Senator Wheeler , chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce . Summarized , the events which led to yesterday 's announcement started when 0 . P. and M. J. Van Sweringen , former newsboys , acquired some real estate outside Cleveland two decades ago . To further the development of this property  --  known as Shaker Heights ? the brothers bought the New York , Chicago &; St. Louis ( Nickel Plate ) Railroad . Their down payment for this carrier was about $900,000 and from this start they acquired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the Erie , Pere Marquette , Chesapeake &; Ohio , Chicago &; Eastern Illinois and Missouri Pacific . It was the acquisition of the Missouri Pacific which led to their downfall . The Allegheny Corporation , top company in the financial pyramid iich they erected to maintain control of the $2,000,000 , - 000 of railroads held through their original investment of $900,000 , became subject to financial straits after 1929 as a result of the Missouri Pacific deal . Unable to Meet Obligations In this crisis the Van Sweringen brothers pledged their controlling interest in the Allegheny Corporation for a loan of about $30,000,000 ? an obligation which , with interest charges , has risen since to more than $40,000,000 . When the brothers were unable to meet this debt , the banks which advanced the money sold the collateral at auction . This collateral was bought by the Midamerica . Corporation , a holding company formed for the purpose by Mr. Ball and G. A. Tomlinson , Great Lakes ship owner . Mr. Tomlinson later sold out to Mr. Ball and recently Mr. Ball transferred control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did this because 0 . P. and M. J. Van Sweringen , whom he had counted upon to take the responsibility of managing the empire off his hands , died . Now , according to the announcement made yesterday , the Allegheny stocks held by the Ball Foundation have been sold for an unnamed consideration to Messrs . Young , Kolbe &; Kirby . All three insisted yesterday that they were the actual buyers and that they were acting for no undisclosed principal . All three also disclaimed the existence of any such contract as gave 0 . P. Van Sweringen virtual control of his empire after Mr. Ball and his associates bought it at the Vesey Street sale . No ten-year options to provide for the transfer of Allegheny control to other interests , such as was provided in the contract between Mr. Ball and Mr. Van Sweringen , is entailed in the transaction , they insisted . Messrs . Ball , Young , Kolbe and Kirby were asked many times to say what was paid for the Allegheny Corporation securities which composed the consideration in the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . title s Mr. Ball said that his rec formed foundation would recze ?

All fbtfit principals agreed that , either vVilttif cash or paper , the payment w cane be completed within a year . all A factor in the situation is that the trustees for the estate of Ooefie Van Sweringen are contesting 14 the courts the validity of the tciaeh Mr. Ball holds to the secur ? which carry control in the Sweringen empire . Mr. Kolbe that the purchaser had been ; ? demnified " against an impe ft title . After first denying it , Mr. announced on April 8 that the america holdings in the Van Sweringen empire had been transferred to a charitable foundation and that these holdings were for sale . Among the interests which bid for these holdings , it later was disclosed , were groups headed by Donaldson Brown , chairman of the finance committee of the General Motors Corporation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has made many ventures into the control and manipulation of railroads. $3,000,000,000 in Empire The Van Swerigen empire consisted of about $2,000,000,000 of railroads and about $1,000,000,000 of real estate , coal companies , barge lines and other enterprises , the latter including the United States Trucking Corporation , largest unit of its kind in the Greater New York area . According to Mr. Ball , the properties subject to the latest transfer include the ones named but omit the Cleveland Railway and the Higbee department store of Cleveland . A recent sale of the Cleveland Railway holdings acquired by Mr. Ball at the Vesey Street auction have reimbursed him for much of the cash outlay he then incurred . The Cleveland railroad terminal , the building of which the New York Central Railroad helped to finance , was included in the sale . It was from the New York Central that the Van Sweringen brothers bought the Nickel Plate . The Pennsylvania Railroad , traditional competitor of the New York Central , has refrained from using the terminal . Mr. Ball gave the first inkling of the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies yesterday afternoon in which he said that announcement of the names of the buyers would be made in the Waldorf-Astoria . It was the first intimation that the many rumors as to possible purchasers which have circulated in recent weeks would be ended by official announcement . Later Mr. Ball issued a prepared statement , in which he said that the control of the Van Sweringen structure had passed " into strong and capable hands . " " He ( Mr. Ball is impressed with the sense of public responsibility possessed by these gentlemen and believes that the interest of the holders of securities of these properties , as well as the public , will be well served , " the statement continued . " Mr. Ball expressed his Intention to continue an interest in these properties in Cleveland through the ownership of securities in certain of the companies controlled by Midamerica Corporation .
