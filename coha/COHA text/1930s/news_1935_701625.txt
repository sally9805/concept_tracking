txt The British today virtually washed their hands of the Hoare-Laval peace Plan now , awaiting answers from Premier Mussolini of Italy and Emperor Haile . Selassie of Ethiopia by turning it over to the league of nations council , , but league circles fear that the economic sanctions front has been broken . While the plan itself is considered doomed , owing to the virtual certainty Haile Selassie will reject it and the unwillingness of the small powers on the council to force ' it down his throat , Premier Mussolini has a good chance of escaping ' an oil embargo by going through the motions of discussing it  --  naturally without halting military operations in Ethiopia . Some of the pessimists here even anticipate the gradual collapse of the whole sanctions crusade . Oil Embargo Postponed . All action on an oil embargo was postponed today until after the meeting of the council which is fixed for next Wednesday . This decision was taken by the committee of eighteen on sanctions . Its only other action was L0 ueciae Inas the peace plan ? along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council . The only members ' of the committee who spoke were Capt . Anthony Eden , British minister for league affairs ; Pierre Laval , French premier , , and M. Komarnicki , Polish delegate . The latter 's motion to postpone discussion of the oil embargo on account of the forthcoming negotiations was taken as evidence of the discouragement general among the small powers . In the lobbies the dominant note among most of the delegates was a loss of confidence in Great Britain and suspicion of her motives . League officials agree that the crusading zeal of the last month was mainly due to the energetic stand taken by the British . Now that the British seem to be hedging there is a general tendency to run for cover and dodge the risks and sacrifices involved in sanctions . See British Deal with France . Some delegates think the covenanting zeal of the British government before Nov. 15 was just electoral propaganda , but many others are convinced the British have sold out the league for some kind of underground deal with the French . Rumors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concocted a scheme for reviving the four power pact and emasculating the league were so current that the British delegation tonight issued an official denial that anything but the Rata-Ethiopian dispute was discussed by the two last Sunday . Eden , who until now has been Geneva 's peerless champion , lost in a desperate attempt to convince the other delegates that British policy has not changed , that Britain still . is backing the league to the limit and that the oil embargo is still very much in the foreground . Spikes Laval Maneuver . Informed through a series of conversations with continental diplomats of the general hostility to the peace plan , Eden promptly spiked the Laval maneuver to have it turned over to a committee of five Britain , France , Spain , Poland , and Turkey . Not only did Eden insist upon having the council pass upon the plan first , but he hinted broadly that he had made no attempt to defend Hoare 's " baby . " " We have no mandate from the coordination committee and that committee had no power to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The proposals now put forward are neither definite nor sacrosanct . If the league does not agree to these suggestions we make no complaint ; indeed , we should cordially welcome any suggestion for their improvement . " In advance I emphasize that so far as his majesty 's government is concerned we will not only readily accept the judgment of our colleagues but will continue to use our best efforts to further the two objectives which constantly have been ? 130orft 48 in this dispute  --  restosationi of peace and maintenance of the authority of the league . " In private conversation Eden went even further , it is understood , giving many delegations the impression that he wanted the plan to be turned down by the council . British circles tonight estimate it has very little chance of being approved and do not seem at all dismayed by the prospect . Whether this unprecedented behavior of the British delegation in seemingly torpedoing its own plan is just a maneuver to disarm criticism or whether it is due to conflict on policy between Hoare , who framed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to defend it , is difficult to decide . In any case it does not lessen the general confusion prevailing here , nor improve the morale of the sanctionist camp . French Optimistic . In sharp contrast with the British , the French delegation was rather optimistic tonight . There was no official exnression of disappointment at not getting the peace plan before the committee of five instead of the council . Laval 's speech before the committee of eighteen was longer than Eden 's , more apologetic in tone and did not indicate so strongly as Eden 's the willingness of the French to invite alterations or even rejection . Copies of the peace plan , which it is understood would give Italy nearly one-half of Ethiopia in exchange for the Italian colonial port of Assabo Eritrea , will be submitted to members of the council privately in the next day or two . Called Nonleague Plan in Rome . Special to the London Daily Tc/cnrimh. and The Chicago Tribune . Chicago Tribune Press Service . ROME , Dec. ** Fascist press was silent about league of nations action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy looked upon the new peace plan as a British and French document , not a league proposal . " The plan does not consist of proposals in themselves , " he said , " but forms a basis for negotiations . It will be examined with the necessary good will and attention . We shall see whether it can form a foundation for negotiations . We hope it will , but ' it would be advisable not to give way to undue optimism . " Asked to comment on the report that Emperor Haile Selassie had rejected the plan , the Italian spokes. man said , " It will make no difference in Italy 's decision . We are not dealing with him , but with Great Britain and France . " Play Up French Annoyance . Press ' comment was confined to Italian correspondents at London , Geneva , and Paris . Much is made of France 's alleged annoyance at " peace spoilers " and the attitude of the smaller states at Geneva . There is a tendency to convince public opinion here that many people of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The delegates of the smaller nations are represented as angry about sanctions which are imposed at Britain 's behest . Therefore , they are now taking advantage of the situation to sabotage the British peace proposals . Meanwhile Fascist party organizations are mobilizing meetings to vote resolutions to " hold out for decision by a well earned victory . " CUBAN CABINET PICKS BARNET AS NEW PRESIDENT HAVANA , Dec. ** A.
