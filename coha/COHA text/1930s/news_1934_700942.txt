txt A picture of the utility interests , strongly entrenched on three fronts ? financial , political and legal  --  and fighting for the preservation of their existing rights , was portrayed yesterday at the first hearing of the legislative committee investigating public utilities , held In the County Courthouse on Foley Square . On the financial side , the power group was accused of having caused an $82,000,000 write-up in assets of the Niagara Hudson Power Corporation at the time of its formation . The committee heard also of how , shortly after the formation of the company , the Carlisle interests and the representative of the Morgan group quarreled , with the result that the Morgan representative , president of the company , resigned by request . Two of the chief backers of the corporation were F. L. Carlisle &; Co. and J. P. Morgan &; Co . Machold Letters Read . On the political side , letters found in the files of H. Edmund Machold , the former Republican State Chairman , were introduced . One letter showed that Mr. Machold was disturbed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , limiting the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in utility cases . He requested Frank D. Comerford , president of the New England Power ' association , to get in touch with Senator Warren R. Austin of Vermont on the matter . Senator Austin , replying to Mr. Comerford , advised seeking an amendment of the bill , " to nullify the bad effect , " instead of trying to kill it , which he , as a member of the Senate subcommittee considering the measure , considered impossible . " It may be impossible to get this amendment , but it seems to me better strategy to try and amend the bill than to try to kill it , " he wrote . His letter was re , layed to Mr. Machold . Lobbyist Analyzes Congress . Also in Mr. Machold 's files , which he opened to the committee 's investigators , was a letter from former Representative E. J. Jones , lobbyist of the American Short Line Railroad Association , which told how the 400 members of the association were checking up on members of the Congress elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This association has always gotten from Its 400 member roads a filled in questionnaire on new members of Congress each election . " This election resulting in such a large turnover we are getting a file on all members , old &; new , for 72 Congress starting March 4th , next . " This gives us ( 1 ) the tendency of the members ' attitude on Utility legislation whether or not he is inclined to Private or Govt. ownership &; operation or believes in Public control &; regulation under Private ownership etc. etc. ( 2 ) where proper and efficient contacts can be made if desired . ( 3 ) The names of ? our officers who will interview the members . ( 4 ) What are the personal , business &; political relations of the Representatives to Utilities especially R. R. In short we can tell pretty well what psychology we are up against and believe me this new bunch will present a variety making ' Heintz ' look sick . There is no copy of this , destroy it &; I will see you some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter written by John F. Otis , Mayor of Oswego from 1931 to 1933 , and defeated for re- election in 1933 . He wrote to Charles E. Norris , Democratic State campaign manager for Smith M 1922 and now a Niagara Hudson official . The letter thanked Mr. Norris for a contribution to Mr. Otis 's Campaign fund and asked him to intercede with A. E. Schoellkopf , head of the State TERA and a power official , to get him an administrative job with the CWA . All this was either drawn from Walter H. Seymour , accountant for the committee , by John E. Mack , counsel to the committee , or read into the record in the form of letters . The facts concerning legal aspects all came from Mr. Mack or from Charles G. Blakeslee , counsel to the Public Service Commission , the only witness besides Mr. Bey/flour called yesterday . Mr. Blakeslee portrayed the success and failure of the Public Service Commission in regulating utilities . In the case of holding companies , he showed , it usually met with failure . He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the stock of an operating company it became subject to the commission , several , companies had eleven holding companies , each carrying less than 10 per cent of the stock of the operating companies . " They call some of these companies ' clearing companies , ' " Mr. Blakeslee said . " Yes , we understand , " said Mr. Mack . " That 's a company that takes care of the surplus and clears out . " Later , service companies of the Associated Gas and Electric Company were accused of " syphoning " $7,000,000 in two years out of their operating companies in the State . Another point brought out by members of the committee was that the utility bills passed at the last session of the Legislature , calling on the companies to pay for the cost of rate cases , were not working for the benefit of the public . Only two of twenty companies have paid the assessments , the rest contesting them in the courts , and those two have paid the costs out of operating expenses , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corruption Found . After the Machold letters were Introduced , Assemblyman Livingston asked if Mr. Machold had been questioned on any of them . " I think not , " Mr. Mack replied . " Do you intend to question him about this ? " " If the committee thinks it is necessary . This was introduced in evidence for the purpose of showing that he was active in Republican politics in the State . There are more there to show that he was consultant in various legislation . " I may say , however , I have none which shows that he was in any way instrumental in handing out money or having anything to do with contributions , so far . If you want me to interrogate Mr. Machold I would be glad to have him come here . The letters are from his files , and there is no denial . The object of the committee is to show that he still has an active interest in political affairs in the State of New York . " The object in showing Mr. Norris 's letter is to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswego and that he is an officer of the Niagara Hudson , so you have them coming and going , both Democrats and Republicans . " May I say something else that I should say , however , that as far as our investigation is concerned we have as yet found no letter or no memorandum or anything indicating corruption on the part of any legislator , and I except the Thayer former Senator Warren T. Thayer letters which were used and gotten out by the Federal Trade Commission . They speak for themselves , but they have n't been handled . We have not touched those . But I have found nothing similar among all the investigation we have made . " Now , we are not through yet . We are going on , but it is only fair to the Legislature that I should say what we have found . If we find it , we will come and tell you , and if we do n't find it , we will come and tell you that . And it does n't make any difference whether Democrat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out . " Mr. Mack also absolved the Niagara Hudson Power Corporation of having resorted to practices similar to those charged to the Associated Gas group . The latter statement brought from members of the committee the declaration that Niagara Hudson did not appear to them to be " a philanthropic institution , " and they revealed by questioning that the corporation , while it taxes its operating companies with no service charges , gets 6 per cent interest on its financing . " They do n't pay the banks they borrow the money from that rate , " Assemblyman Jacob H , Livingston of Brooklyn declared . " The rate varies , " Randall Le Boeuf , counsel to Niagara Hudson , said . Beck Memorandum . A memorandum from former Representative James M. Beck , forwarded to Floyd L. Carlisle of the Niagara Hudson group by a partner in the law firm of Shearman &; Sterling , discussed the Johnson bill , now enacted into law , as follows : " I have taken up the matter with some members of the House Judiciary Committee , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful that - there will be no attempt on the part of the House Judiciary Committee to report it out at this session . I underscore thee word ' hopeful , ' for if word comes from the White House that the Brain Trust wish the Johnson bill passed , it will result in a hurried meeting of the Judiciary Committee , a favorable report , a special rule , and , with an hour 's debate and no chance for amendment , the bill will be passed . However , I am encouraged to believe that this will not take place during this session . " The letter was forwarded to Mr. Carlisle in , Tune , 1933 . The Johnson bill did not pass until the 1934 session . The hearing started yesterday at 10:30 A. M. , with Speaker Joseph A. presiding , in the absence of Senator Dunnigan , majority leader . All the other members of the committee were present . They are Senators George A. Fearon , J. F. Twomey , Philip M. Kleinfeld , Joseph D. Nunan and Benjamin F. Feinberg , and Assemblymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leonard W. Hall , John S. Thompson and Harry F. Dunkel . Mr , Mack spoke briefly of the work of the committee 's staff to date , and then called his witness , Mr. Seymour , who said that he had served in the Pecora investigation and many others . The testimony took in exhibits showing the financial set-up and the territory of the various power groups in the State , and then turned to the organization of the Niagara Hudson holding company in 1929. $50,000,000 Cash Put Up . That testimony showed that $50 , - 000,000 in cash was put up by the Schoellkopf interests , F. L. Carlisle &; Co. , Nicholas F. Brady , American Superpower Company , J. P. Morgan , and the United Gas Improvement Company , a Morgan company known as the U. G. I. Mr. Seymour testified as to the affiliations of the various officers , saying that George H. Howard represented United Corporation , at that time a Morgan-Bonbright Company , and R. P. Stevens , the president of Niagara Hudson , the Bonbright interests . Harold Stanley , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony about the quarrel in the company . Mr. Mack asked the questions and Mr. Seymour answered : Q. ? What was the trouble ? A. ? They represented entirely different interests and I believe Mr. Stevens wanted to run the organization ? his way , and Mr. CarlisleQ. ? What was his way ? A. ? Well , it seemed that . he was running it , as I understand it , for the United Corporation , rather than for the benefit of the stockholders of the Niagara Hudson . Q. ? Well , from the papers did it appear that he desired to carry on stock market activities there ? A. ? To a certain extent . Some of the papers show that he had some desire to trade in the stock of the Niagara Hudson Power Corporation . Q. What about Carlisle ? A. ? Mr. Carlisle did not seem to be in favor of it . Q. ? What happened ? There was conflict there ? A. ? Also I under-stand Q. ? You understand what you get from the files . You are testifying now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company ? A. ? I was n't going to , no . Q. -- Go ahead . What-are you tes -- fifying to ? A. ? I understand from Mr. Carlisle that Mr. Stevens also wanted to release some of the key men in the system , bringing in , I believe , men of his own choosing and as I understand it , most of those men have been with the underlying companies for a great many years , and because of that Mr. Carlisle , *of course , was not in favor of doing what Mr. Stevens wanted to do . Q. ? What was the result of all this ? A. ? On Nov. 25 , 1929 , Mr. Stevens resigned . I believe , my impression would be , that he resigned because he was asked to resign , because they wanted him to resign . Further testimony showed that the Morgan interests later retired from a dominant position in tale combination , through letting Mr. Carlisle , by means of his controlling interest in the St. Regis Paper Company , get control of the United Corporation . The St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and United Corporation the largest stockholder , at the present time , in Niagara Hudson . The acquisition of control of United Corporation by Carlisle took place in March , 1931 , the testimony indicated . *82,000,000 " Write-Up . " The " write-up " of $92,000,000 was brought out by a table prepared by Mr. Seymour from the company books . It showed the approximate book value of the securities received by Niagara Hudson from the holding companies it absorbed to be $147,000,000 ; the value placed by Niagara Hudson on the shares of the companies that it received to be $230,000,000 , making the write-up more than $82 , - 000,000 . The market value of the securities on May 1 , 1929 , was $349,526,000 , but by the time the merger was accomplished , several months later , the market value was $613,000,000 . Assemblyman Livingston asked Mr. Seymour if any new assets were represented in the $82,000,000 increase . " No , sir , there was not , " Mr. Seymour replied . " It was just stock jobbing ? " ' " That is correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Niagara Hudson and an exhibit showed a steady increase from 1929 to the present . The table of salaries follows . 1929 $109,893 1930 116,568 1931 . 172,285 1932 . 191,627 1933 . 214,225 1934 ( first half ) 132,225 Figures first put into evidence indicated a payment of about $47 , - 000,000 in dividends during five years while the company was operating at a loss , but this later was cleared up and corrected figures showed that only a few hundred thousands were paid out of surplus by the company . When Mr. Mack had Charles L. McCann , associate counsel , read the Machold letters into the record , Senator Feinberg , a Republican , suggested , after a while , that they not be read , but just put into the record . He was shouted down by the Democratic members , and even Speaker said they should be read . " I have some Democratic letters , too , " Judge Mack said with a smile . He was referring to the letter from Mayor Otis to Mr. Norris . Sidelight on Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show his political activities , was addressed to a bank president , then in a Montreal hospital with a broken leg . It asked the banker , Clarence E. Kilburn , to permit " Jim La Tour " to run again for the Assembly that Fall , 1933 . Mr. La Tour , the letter indicated , had promised the banker , to whom he owed money , that he would quit politics and tend to business , to clear up the debt . Mr. Machold intervened on the ground that for Mr. La Tour to quit might endanger party success in the district . Mr. Kilburn wrote Mr. La Tour two days later that " the People 's Trust Company of Malone and I both release you from your promise not to run for any political office this Fall . " In explaining the Otis letter , Mr. Mack said that private hearings had been held on it , and that Mr. Otis and Mr. Norris had both told him that the " sub rasa " contribution mentioned had never been made , nor had Mr. Otis got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Mr. Norris had failed to make the contribution , after promising it , and the letter was designed to shame him into doing something for Mr. Otis and the party . After the testimony concerning holding companies , the committee , the witness , Mr. Blakeslee , and Mr. Mack all agreed that the present law was inadequate . Some companies resorted to interesting devices to ? get eleven names for holding companies for one operating company , in order to escape supervision , the testimony brought out . One group named each company after trees ' Ashwood , Beech , Birch , Chestnut , Linden , Mahogany , Maplewood , Pinewood , Poplar , &c.; In the case of the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company , the holding companies were named alphabetically  --  Aden , Burma , Canton , Dover , Etna , &c.; The committee had a short executive session at the end of the hearing . It will reconvene at 10 A. M. today at the court house . It was understood that the committee considered calling Mayor La Guardia , but he will not testify today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
