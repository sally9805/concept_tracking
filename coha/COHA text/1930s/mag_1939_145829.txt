A familiar gypsy trick is to enter a grocery store , wait until proprietor and clerks are occupied with important customers , then tuck turnips , garlic , apples , other staples under the ample gypsy blouse . Japan , adept at this gypsy technique , last week took advantage of France 's and England 's busy dickerings with Italy and Germany to slip seven small potatoes-the Spratly Islands-under her kimono . <P> In 1867 , while charting the South China Sea , Britain 's map-making ship Rifleman found a circle of sandy coral reefs , each about 500 yards by 300 and rising only eight feet above sea level . The British named the islands for an obscure whaling captain-and forgot them . In 1933 , French sailors from the surveying ship Astrolabe and the dispatch vessel Alerte , finding a handful of Chinese living happily on the reefs on coconuts , bananas , sweet potatoes and succulent turtles , hoisted a French flag on each island , blew a bugle call , buried bottles containing a French claim to the islands-and forgot them . <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing occupation of the islands for " protection and regulation of lives , property and enterprises of Japanese nationals there . " Actually , aside from small turtle fisheries and idle phosphate works , the islands are practically uninhabited . As a heavy shipping base they are useless , for the surrounding waters are a rocky , treacherous graveyard . Japan 's real reason for the snatch was to get a good airplane and submarine base ( the lagoons inside the reefs insure sheltered landing and mooring ) within striking distance of dependencies of Britain ( Singapore , 640 miles away ; Sarawak , 350 ; Hong Kong , 1,000 ) , France ( Saigon , in French Indo-China , 300 ) , The Netherlands ( Borneo , 500 ) , the U. S. ( Manila , 700 ) . From the little Spratly Islands , Japanese planes or submarines could attack any vessel in the China Sea , and get back again with plenty of fuel to spare . <P> Of the four nations concerned , only France , the legal if doubtful owner , entered a formal diplomatic complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as steal like gypsies , said little when France complained about the snatch of Hainan in February . They were mum this week .
