WHEN the militant suffragettes demanded the franchise and got it they achieved far more than they had anticipated ? certainly more than they had bargained for or than had been envisioned by the men who grudgingly admitted the justice of their claim . They fought for the vote ; but eventually they won the right to become breadwinners in the incredibly mad new order which has enveloped us since the great collapse in 1929 . For it has become increasingly apparent that within the so-called professional class a startling reversal of the traditional family pattern is taking place : the man of the family is now often the dependent , and the woman is the provider and economic mainstay . She faces the task of filling the family purse ; he , the adjustment to the role of hearth-tender . In case after case among my acquaintances , the husband is unemployed and the wife is at work , and both of them are facing a psychological problem of readjustment vastly more terrifying than the economic wolves howling at the apartment door . Why this condition should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are affected by it are as surprised and vexed as the men . A few of them went to work because they felt their homes no longer provided an adequate outlet for their talents . They wanted careers . But most of them went to work because they had to ? because the earnings of the man of the family were inadequate for the main-tenance of a decent standard of living , or because they hoped , by working , to lay aside enough to provide for their children 's education . There is no indication that more than a handful of women went outside the home for the sake solely of making money . I doubt whether there is one who hoped by working to assume the full economic burden of her family . Most of those I know turned their backs on their homes courageously but with heavy hearts , believing that their entry into the economic world was only a temporary emergency measure to be abandoned when the family 's purse bulged again ? which they hoped and believed would be soon . With realism characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toehold in the masculine business world at least two qualifications were required : they either had to excel their masculine competitors or they had to work for so much lower wages that it was economically advantageous to employ them . Their strategy was based on these facts and they moved forward , slowly but not very gloriously . They ate at second table through the early ' 20s . They took what they could get . They became accustomed to the economic crumbs . How many times they did the economic chores in commerce and industry , chores which were unpleasant and even menial and , therefore , " womanly " ! How many businesses had masculine " fronts " but women executives ! How few women pulled down the plums in the economic world , despite their yeoman service in nurturing the orchards where the plums grew ! But the orchard is blighted now , and the story is different . Women , working for lower wages than men , became economically desirable after the Wall Street &Mile.; The high-salaried men workers were the first to be let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result , between one and two million women in this country are the support of their families ? fulltime breadwinners and part-time homemakers , through neither their own nor their husbands ' choice but , one is forced to conclude , because of inexorable economic laws . And what is the result ? Far-reaching , certainly ; sometimes disastrous . In the homes of the laboring classes where this condition has come about I am inclined to think it is not serious . At least , they seem more adjusted to it , more accustomed to it , and certainly less perturbed by it . For example , my work recently required me to investigate the neediest charity cases in my city , a large center where suffering brought on by the present crisis is acute . Most of the neediest , I found , were families in which the sole breadwinner , if any , was a woman ? either the mother of the family or the oldest daughter . But these women had been the sole support for years . It was expected by all concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a five-and-ten counter or work in a taxi-dance hall at night in order to support the father , brother , or husband . They faced an economic problem , to be sure , because these women workers never have and never will earn enough to support the family . They are and probably will always be in want . But since they themselves expect to be , they do not represent a psychological problem . It is among the white-collar workers that the breakdown of morale is occurring . If I write with II conviction it is because I know whereof I speak . I have been the sole breadwinner in my home for more than two years . In 1929 , when my husband and I were married , our joint income totalled something more than seven thousand dollars a year . Each of us had small savings accounts , but we had both invested the major part of our money in stocks . I had graduated from college three years before , and my standing in the business world was by no means secure . Though my savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had gone into business to relieve my parents of the burden of my support , since they had sacrificed a good deal to see me through the State university . Taking care of myself and relieving them of that economic burden were my chief considerations at the time . Insurance , old-age savings ? these , said , I will take care of later . My husband , eleven years my senior , had put little by , for a number of wholly understandable reasons . Trained to be a soldier , a captain of infantry at twenty-three ? one of the youngest captains in the American Expeditionary Force ? he adjusted himself to civilian life after the War with considerable financial success but great psychological difficulty . His first marriage , a wartime romance , ended ultimately in a Paris divorce , and when he returned to this country he had little money left and little desire to make more . He was just becoming established again when we were married . Then came the disastrous years of 1929-1930 ! people during the hours I spent away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housework . Heavens ! The idea that women no longer have much housework to do is a pernicious myth . Even in a home as small as ours domestic duties at times reached staggering proportions . Sundays were devoted entirely to cleaning , washing , mending , taking care of bills , getting the laundry ready or checking it and putting it away , working out budgets for our dwindling resources , planning meals for the coming week , keeping the cupboards clean and orderly , laying out my husband 's clothes and my own for the dry cleaner , getting the dust out of closet corners where our day maid never swept , and darning , darning , darning . Some of these duties , of course , stretched through the week ; but I tried to finish as many of them on Sunday as possible because I was sometimes able to earn extra money by special work at the office on my free week nights . It appeared to my distracted husband that I saved up duties all week for the one day which we should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had time to be quietly together . Let me make it clear here that my husband is a very intelligent , talented person , normally self-assured , and as free of complexes as a pm-Freudian . Until the depression be had always been in a commanding position , first in military life and then as a civilian . His income had always been more than ample to cover his expenses , heavy as they always were . He had , for example , been in the habit of ordering not only his suits made to order but his shoes and shirts as well . I have known him to spend more for an overcoat than our income now amounts to in a month . Curbing an inborn love of the best became not the least of his problems . He is , moreover , a thoughtful , exceed-ingly sensitive person who suffers as keenly under the burdens of those he loves as under the weight of his own woes . As time went on we could no longer keep up the pretense that what we were passing through was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the situation would one day magically dissolve was in itself exhausting and demoralizing . We faced the alternatives of readjusting our whole outlook and domestic organization or giving up our marriage . But we were devoted to each other and readjustment , therefore , became the only answer . III Before I go into that readjustment , let me digress a moment to discuss the experiences of some of my friends , just as my husband and I did at the time . There were many who were facing precisely the same situation we were facing . Some had children and they , of course , vastly complicated matters . Most , like ourselves , were childless , but had been putting aside varying sums before 1929 against the day when they could afford children . And most of them , like ourselves , have now concluded that they must abandon that hope altogether . The realization of how widespread was the problem we faced came one day last summer during my vacation . It had been impossible for us to go anywhere because we could not afford it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , hoping to forget for three days at least our poignantly trying problems . There were to be five other couples there , only two of whom we knew . To the horror of our hostess , it developed after we arrived that every one of the wives at the party was employed and every one of the husbands jobless . It was one of the most painful week-ends I have ever spent anywhere ; for each of us had looked forward to it as a momentary escape and found in it only an intensification of an intolerable condition . Among friends who are social workers I have observed that the situation is particularly pronounced , probably because social workers have kept their jobs while their husbands , employed in other fields , have lost theirs in the very crisis which has insured the jobs of their wives . Some of our friends confronted with the situation have been completely defeated by it . One woman I know made a valiant effort to keep her home going after her husband had lost his position as an accountant . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menage intact took on the fighting , protective aspects of primitive motherhood as months of unemployment stretched out behind and ahead of him . But while his dependence on her increased , his affection for her waned , and he began to turn for attention and comfort to women of less intrepidity who did not make him so keenly aware of his inadequacy and subordinate position in the home . I know of two other homes that have broken up because of unbearable psychological problems which developed when the husband was robbed by social conditions of self-respect , of prestige , of everything but the empty , traditional constraint to be head of the house . To argue that those people were weaklings and that their homes would probably not have stood the vicissitudes of married life anyway , is gratuitous . They are the sons and daughters of our founding fathers , born to the proud traditions of our arrogant country , hurtled into a morass of social disorder , and utterly unequipped either psychologically or by inheritance or education to meet this situation . The women I know in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thoughtful and resilient in making what was inevitably a bitter adjustment . But the problem has been too great . I know , for instance , of one jobless man who took over all the household duties when it became obvious that his wife 's earnings as a librarian would be their only income for an incalculable length of time . He learned to cook and took a humorous pride in his achievement . He prepared all the meals and did all the housework . Noticing that his wife was still constrained to wash and mend her clothes and underthings when she returned home from work , he presently took over those tasks too . A college graduate with an M. A. degree , he spent his spare time studying for his Ph . D. , and was making fairly rapid progress . But his new role , the prolonged unemployment , and the realization that the strain on his wife was still too great weighed on his mind . In the end , he left home , assuring his wife that when he could meet her half way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overabundance of high character which makes this particular backwash of the economic tide disastrous to so many . I think the couple I know who have suffered most from this topsy-turvy condition were so chivalrous that it took them two years to look an unchivalrous economic condition straight in the face , and then it was too late . They were both earning good salaries when the crash came . He was employed in a Wall Street firm and had invested most of their money in what were considered high-grade securities . After Black October and November , not only his job but most of their money was gone . He set out at once to look for work , so confident of finding it that he did not even tell his wife either of his own fate or their lost money . Her faith in him was implicit . As time went on and bond salesmen became as unnecessary as the iceman in January , he realized that he would have to make a clean breast of the whole matter . He used up what capital was Left maintaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that somewhere he would find an opening . And when the denouement inevitably came he was not only completely broke but his morale was bankrupt . They moved to separate establishments finally when her efforts to reestablish his belief in himself failed . That relieved the pressure for a time and they were even contemplating a complete reconciliation when she lost her job . I think the reconciliation might still have been effected if she had remained unemployed . They would then have had a common ground for accord . But she did n't . She went out to look for work ? and found it , just as scores of other women have found work in these times when their menfolk can not . My friend found not one job but two , part-time jobs both , which paid her pitifully little and which kept her at work from early morning until late at night . But between them she was able to make ends meet . Sometimes , after that , her husband came to her apartment for dinner . But pride would not allow him to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not let her buy others for him , and since he could not buy them himself , he preferred to remain away from her . For a year she lived in a state of emotion bordering on hysteria , trying to see the outcome of their problem . I met her recently and she was calm and poised , her old self again . She had not heard from her husband in weeks . She had canvassed his friends trying to find him until her tense nerves snapped under the strain . She is starting again now , alone . There was , perhaps , less tragedy , but even more irony in the home of still another woman I know . She is a photographer of wild animal life . Her husband is an engineer . Their mutual love of faraway places drew them together and their marriage seemed ideal . But the supply of engineers was too great even before the slump . Since then they have become as superfluous as stock salesmen , and the husband has been unemployed for two years . Demand for the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by necessity , she nurtured that demand , taking long and hazardous trips into the jungles alone to get the pictures which brought an income to them . Between expeditions she attended night schools , fitting herself for scientific research work so she could still further pad out the family income . The husband , demoralized by the long period of unemployment , ultimately convinced himself that his search for work was hopeless . He spent his days brooding and relapsed now and then into apparently violent illnesses which were diagnosed on three separate occasions as psychological escapes and nothing more . The wife , a strong , intelligent woman , has again and again conquered the tropic jungles alone , but to-day she finds herself defeated by this phenomenon of civilization . She has wasted away shockingly in both body and spirit under the stress of the situation , and as this is being written she has finally accepted the inevitable and is suing for divorce . If these were isolated instances one could dismiss them as tragic but socially insignificant . As a matter of fact , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its social ramifications are vast . Two recent studies , one made on c large scale and one on a small scale show that between 40 per cent and 5 per cent of the wage-earning married women in this country are the economic mainstays of their families . One study , made at the instance of the Women 's Bureau of the U. S. Department of Labor , was in a New England factory , to determine whether it would be possible to employ more " deserving " workers by dismissing the married women . It was found that of the 28 married women employed , eleven , almost 40 per cent , were the only steady breadwinners in their families . Their husbands were either unemployed , on part time , or totally incapacitated by ill health . Another study , by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , showed that in 34,000 families in Philadelphia in each of which a married woman was employed full time , almost 9,700 , or 28 per cent , normally depended entirely upon this woman for support . And in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other employable members were either jobless or working part time . If these percentages hold among all our 3,900,000 " homemakers " who are gainfully employed outside their homes , then one may calculate that between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 married women in this country not only hold the purse strings but fill the purse . In this connection it is significant to note that in none of the instances I know , where the wife is the breadwinner , has she assumed the authority , the dictatorial , commanding attitude that was considered the prerogative of the wage earner in the pre-depression , pre-suffrage home . Perhaps some day that may happen , but I doubt it . For the posturing , the commanding , dictatorial attitudes of the pre-War masculine breadwinner were possible only because men had enshrouded their prowess as money makers with a mystic , esoteric quality . The little woman , tending the fireside , was expected to be eternally awed and amazed at the talents of her man in battling the world and bringing home the booty every Saturday night . She was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed . But the long feminine fight for equality which began with suffrage and the War , and went over the top with the depression , has ripped the last vestige of mysticism from the rite of earning a living . Women thought they were fighting for a chance to make money if they cared to . What they won was the necessity to earn their own and their families ' living or starve . They are taking what they won , think , with a realism characteristic of their sex . They are seeking what jobs they can find at any salary they can command . Surveys of the National Industrial Conference Board in 1929-30 show that the earnings of women in manufacturing industries at their highest were only from 71 per cent to 92 per cent as high as those of unskilled masculine laborers . In the white-collar class there was probably less of a discrepancy between the salaries paid to men and women , though there was and still is a vast amount of discrimination in that field between the man and woman worker . Since 1929 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys indicate that women 's wages have been more drastically cut than have men 's . Women have at all times resented this discrimination , naturally , but accepted it , hoping that either a fairer adjustment would one day be made , or that the necessity for going outside their homes would one day be removed . IV It seems both impossible and undesirable for women to continue to be both homemakers and breadwinners over any long period of time . Both their homes and their jobs suffer . Yet , under present conditions , it is becoming more and more difficult for men to fulfill their traditional roles . Women will work for less , and , therefore , are getting the jobs that are available . That this trend is cutting down purchasing power and intensifying our economic collapse , does not , apparently , make enough difference to employers to convince them that they should employ men at men 's wages . In very many homes , as I have observed , the problem is being met by a complete transposition of roles between husband and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponders the problems of budgets , meals , and outgoing laundry . I heard of one woman recently who gave up her job when she married , expecting to be a homemaker for the rest of her life . When her husband lost his job last year she went to his office , applied for his job , and got it ? at half the salary . She asked why her husband had not been kept on at the lower rate and was told that the organization would not offer a man such a salary . So she took the job , and her husband took over the household . Their situation was much like the one in our own home . For we found ultimately that it was impossible to meet an industrial and economic world with a medieval code of ethics . It was impossible and morale-breaking to attempt to live up to the traditions in which we had been nurtured . We had an income , meager to be sure , but sufficient . There was no genuine financial problem . There was only the problem of adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over the financial burden with the zest and interest of a full-time , pants-wearing breadwinner , and my husband agreed to take over the household duties with an equal measure of pride . It has not been easy . It is galling to me to have friends ask after him as though he were incapacitated or " a case . " It is galling to him , at times , to have to remind me that the milkman will be around with his bill and the allowance is all used up . But those are minor irritations which , with a modicum of humor , we can see beyond . Knowing that so many others are faced with the same plight , conscious that in the economic world as it is to-day there will probably be more as time goes on , we meet the problem with something of the zest of social pioneers . We feel that the time may very possibly come when the situation will he so general that boys and girls will be trained together in homemaking classes exactly as they are now trained together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter marriage realizing that either may at any time be called upon to take up the duties which an outworn tradition has heretofore labeled as definitely masculine or feminine . From to-day 's perspective such a situation seems fantastic and paradoxical . But in the long run it may be not only pleasant but desirable . Many years ago Dr. Charles Steinmetz predicted that through the development of electricity no person would have to work more than 800 hours a year . The technocrats have now cut that figure down to 660 hours a year . Earning a living is certainly going to become less of a burden as our economic processes are perfected , and homemaking with its correlative problems of leisure is going to become much more important . It seems to me quite possible that as the problem of brcadwinning diminishes , the prestige formerly attached to it will disappear , and correspondingly the stigma attached to the periodically jobless person will also be removed . Men and women may then work at the tasks which confront them , whether they are in the home or in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering the acute anguish which besets them to-day . Children will complicate matters then as they do now , but perhaps by the time we have made slaves of our machines , the childbearing woman will not be a liability in business as she now is . Perhaps organizations in general or the State will provide maternity pensions or follow the example of Barnard College , Columbia University , which last year voted to allow maternity leave for a half year on full pay or a full year on half pay to any woman member of the college administrative or teaching staff who is expecting a child . For our own part , my husband and I watch with keen interest this newsocial development , and are making every effort to meet it sanely and without hysteria . While we have ceased to regard our own situation as temporary and are having a good deal of fun finding new values in our respective new jobs , we , nevertheless , discover ourselves hoping involuntarily that our positions may one day again be transposed . I almost lapsed into my old pre-depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my husband announced that he had found work at last . But the dereliction was short-lived . He had gone to work on a part-time job paying twenty dollars a week ? doing publicity work for a woman . " Just egg money , darling , " he murmured .
