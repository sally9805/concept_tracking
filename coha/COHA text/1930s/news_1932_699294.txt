txt When President ELIOT 's long and illustrious term had ended it was thought that no name could soon be put beside his . But that of A. LAWRENCE LOWELL is already written there . Without the educational statesmanship of Lownts , the work of ELIOT could not have been made perfect . St. CHRYSOSTOM said : " It is " not names which give confidence " in things , but things which give " confidence in names . " The things which President LOWELL has done will give him permanent name in the chronicles not only of American education but of world affairs . Nothing human has been foreign to his own daring interest ; and this insatiable desire to know something of everything found expression in his educational philosophy . But it was coupled with an insistence that there should be a mastery of some one subject . To this end the electives which had brought new disciplines into the curriculum should be so grouped by each student as to give him acquaintance both with the content of truth in his chosen field of concentration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in finding truth in any and every field . " Give each student a " working brain and make him edu " cate himself " is President LowELL 'S general prescription . He not only led the way rounding out the elective system by the grouping of choices ; he introduced the general examination for the fostering of intelligence , without which learning is vain . Further help to this end was given by the tutorial system under which the student has the companionship and guidance of young teachers " selected because of " special abilities or a taste for per " sonal instruction . " There is also an outward and visible evidence of his masterful pondering over the new problems of education presented by the growing numbers and diverse demands of the social and political order upon colleges and universities . When Mr. HARKNESS came with his gift of millions for the first of the " Houses " he found that President LOWELL had a plan already thought through  --  a plan which has now come to almost complete realization . He once quoted Mr. Justice HoLmEs as saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum . Wisdom rests largely upon having a pattern in mind . But there must be not only a pattern , as he himself added , but " a deep sense of responsibility for carrying it into effect . " His culminating achievement ( the " House Plan " ) is a supreme illustration of the wisdom which thinks not of " proximate results " or " quick successes . " His plans of twenty years ' making might have had to wait another score of years or even more for their translation into the structures of his hopes . Fortunately he has been permitted to see the entire group of **26;998;TOOLONG completed . They will stand as monuments to him as a great educational pioneer and leader . But beyond even their memories will be carried the influence of his regime , which is well characterized by his contention that more than any other form of government democracy needs what lie strove ever to give through Harvard University , " the recruiting and perfecting of the best minds .
