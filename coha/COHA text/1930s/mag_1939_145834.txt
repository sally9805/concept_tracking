Favorite pastimes of the Maharajas of Indore , wealthiest state in the Central India Agency , are shikar ( hunting ) and zenana ( harem ) . In shikar , where elephants assist , the Maharajas have never made a serious misstep ; but in zenana. they have made mistakes . Last week Indore 's incumbent ruler . His Highness Maharajadhiraj Raj Rajeshwar Sawai Shree Sir Yeshwant Rao Holkar Bahadur* indicated that his interest in zenana was over . He was married . <P> The present Maharaja 's father , Tukoji Rao III , once fell in love with a nautch-girl named Mumtaz Begum .

One day when Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were out driving , a band of thugs hired by the Maharaja set upon them , stabbed Bawla to death , were only prevented from killing Mumtaz Begum by a group of Englishmen returning from a go of golf , armed with drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maharaja was obliged to abdicate in favor of his son . He fell in love soon after with a girl from Seattle named Nancy Miller , who was given a Hindu purification and then made his wife . <P> Like father , like son . At the age of 16 , Prince Yeshwant was married-to a girl aged ten . Two years later he left her temporarily for an education at Oxford , where he acquired modern ideas .

Last week , in India , the Maharaja announced that , except for abdication , he had just followed the lead of his father and of Prince Edward , Duke of Windsor-married an American woman .
