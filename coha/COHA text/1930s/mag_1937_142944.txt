Many a lean British Cavalry officer lolling in his Pall Mall or Piccadilly Club , many a ruddy , fox-hunting squire taking a pull at the Tuke Holdsworth 1908 , exploded apoplectically last week as they thumbed through the Illustrated London News . What pulled them up snorting was a series of pictures of old , crippled , starved horses almost too decrepit to stand , all of whom had done gallant War-time service . Most pitiable were two photographs of a famished , broken-kneed old black mare which had once seen proud service with the nth Hussars , a bay cavalry gelding with " all his joints gone and very lame in the near-fore and near-hind . " They were two survivors of 80,000 British Army horses and mules sold by the British Government to Belgium in 1919 , put to work in mines , hitched to produce-wagons and canal-barges . Coming on these pictures most Britons were more convinced than ever that " no damned Froggie knows how to treat a horse . " <P> Year ago Britain 's Our Dumb Friends ' League-a be-kind-to-animals organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rescue from the Continent any of these horses that had survived . The league had little difficulty in tracing them because each bears an identifiable Army mark . Moreover a noted Belgian animal lover , the Dowager Duchess De Croy , provided the league with a list of all the old horses in Belgium . Whenever the League finds a British Warhorse and has enough money on hand , they buy it for about $100 , take it to the League 's stables in . Brussels , put the horse to grass for perhaps the first time in 18 years , later send it to Britain to be " pensioned off " in some country paddock . <P> By last week 25 had been rescued out of an estimated 600 survivors throughout France &; Belgium . Many of the 25 were blind , many carried scars of the battlefield , all were in miserable shape . Long-starved , the horses had to be prevented from disastrous overeating , were kept down to a daily seven pounds of hay , a weekly gallon of beer . Most gratifying to the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their English . After only a few weeks with British grooms , the horses would be obeying orders they had not heard since the War .
