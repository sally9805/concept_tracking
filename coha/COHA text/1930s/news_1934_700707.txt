txt General Johnson has written a letter to II President Roosevelt recommending the termination of one-man control of the National Recovery Administration , and the setting up of a commission to pilot the future course of the industrial rehabilitation machine . General Johnson urged that the government retain its veto power in code operations , however , and that the basic principles of the NRA remain unchanged . The President is expected to accept the proposal when he returns to Washington from his trip to Hawaii . Whether General Johnson would be a member of the commission would rest entirely with the President . All that the administrator would say today in answer to that question was that he would continue his service in the NRA " just as long as the President needs me . " Many Problems Await Solution . Many problems are awaiting solution and many kinks , General Johnson added , need to be ironed out before the commission would be ready to function . At the same time , he indicated he would be glad to return to private life , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Johnson denounced as " absolutely untrue " a widely published report that he had set up within the NRA organization a council of five of his principal subordinates which would direct its affairs during his trip across the continent , which starts tomorrow . " There will be no five-man body in control while I am away , " he said , " and Colonel G. A. Lynch , my administrative assistant , will be the executive officer in Washington ' and will be in daily contact with me . There was not a word of truth in that story . " At this point , General Johnson was asked the question that brought to light the fact that he had written the letter to the President . The President , he said , would not have to wait for , Congressional sanction in order to put his recommendation in force . All that would be necessary would be an Executive order . For Non-Partisan Commission . " Did you recommend a non-partisan commission ? " General Johnson was asked . " I certainly did , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " General Johnson continued , " I suggested that the period of one-man administration of the NRA was , in my opinion , ready to be terminated . I would like to see the question taken up as soon as possible , or as soon as we can get the basic code for small industries in shape and a few other matters ironed out . It is my opinion that as we move into the period of administrative , instead of the pioneering work of setting up codes , we will need more balance in carrying out the principles of the NRA . " The ? general did not anticipate any material changes in the " underlying principles " of the NRA . Asked what those " underlying principles " were , he replied that the answer would be an essay , and he did not have the time to write one . A suggestion has been made that the future administration of the NRA be entrusted to a council of code authorities . The general has no sympathy with this proposition . " Whatever is done , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will subscribe to no reorganization that does not include that principle . Whatever is set up should protect the public and safeguard the interests of the government . " To Remain as Long as Needed . " If your recommendations are approved by the President , how long will you remain in the NRA ? " General Johnson was asked . " Just as long as the President needs me , " was the reply . Beyond that he refused to discuss the question of his possible early return to private life . His letter to the President , he explained , did not suggest the size of the proposed commission . Answering a question , he said the membership might well be recruited . from the official staff of the NRA . They are the people who , in his opinion , are best qualified , since they are the ones with " experience behind them . " Near the close of his talk with the correspondents the administrator reverted to persistent reports that he will not remain much longer as the directing head of the NRA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tomorrow I am getting out , " he said . " That is not true . I will be back about the same time as the President . " He was asked how long he thought it would take to set up the proposed commission form of administration . " Two or three months , " was his answer . Four Speeches on Program . Asked if it was true , as reported , that his combined speaking tour and vacation which starts tomorrow had been curtailed by the President , the reply was that he would speak at Waterloo , Iowa , on Thursday , and at Portland , Ore. , next Sunday . A few days later he will go to the University of California , at Berkeley , to receive a Phi Beta Kappa key , after which he expects to make a third speech at Los Angeles . Then will follow a two weeks ' vacation in the Rockies , after which he will make a speech in Chicago and then return to Washington . General Johnson looked very tired . He said he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure for Waterloo tomorrow . One of the matters he will pass upon will be a request of the Steel Institute that the steel industry be exempted from the operation of the President 's executive order allowing bidders on Federal contracts to go as much as 15 per cent below minimum prices fixed in the Steel Code . He declined to indicate what his decision would be . His office , he added , is " deluged " with protests against the order from scores of other industries . He did not indicate that any immediate action to meet these protests was in prospect . The NRA , it also was disclosed , has suggested a reduction of building material prices in order to expedite the government housing progpam , and also has asked the cooperation of organized labor to the same end . The lumber nidustry is understood to be ready to do all it can to help . Other industries , as well as organized labor , had not replied when General Johnson 's office closed tonight .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
