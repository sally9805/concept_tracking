JESUS KNEW A STORY BY E. P. O'DONNELL T nE Mississippi had clawed through its west bank . Alert boatmen were paddling about finding people marooned . Refugee camps had sprung up here and there , clusters of pointed tents the color of the river , standing like military encampments without arms or colors . In the shriveled hamlet of Tete Noir there was one living person  --  a girl in a magnolia tree with a milk goat . The tree was full of white flowers the size of a baby 's head . The goat straddled a branch , and the girl held her by the horn . All around them below was thick yellow water , hardly flowing . All morning they sat there , and the goat made frantic attempts to reach the leaves above her head . The girl wore a silver star hanging on a string from her neck . In the afternoon the girl was crying out , " Jesus ! Jesus ! " She looked like a pale Indian  --  the inscrutable eyes and the opulent braids of hair dangling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply into the crook of her arm . The goat kicked violently . After calling Jesus for the last time she heard the brittle rapping of an approaching motor boat with voices . Then she thanked Jesus and waited . The two men in the boat were volunteer rescuers , both very dark , of uncertain racial stock . Airplane scouts had reported some refugees marooned in the attic of Bubber Joe 's , a large cottongin south of Tete Noir . The men turned their faces about and about , searching . A cotton gin is a fat gray-hided mass of timbers with four thick legs and a pendant metal trunk , to inhale in a few moments the product of an entire family 's labor for a year . " You smell the mules ? " asked Ed Jefferson , the one in charge . " Tell me Bayou Desjardins is chocked up with big dead sugar mules . " " I do n't see no cotton gin , " said Pauly , his companion . No one was about to direct them . The town was under water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submerged , squatted in the bright yellow silence with a limp flag on the tall staff . " I thought the schoolhouse 'd be fulla pretty teachers , " said Ed , " leanin ' out the windows to be saved . " A faint call was heard , the girl in the distant magnolia . They swung their boat round , cutting through the school-yard . The boat sent waves over the tops of the two basketball goals . Ed Jefferson was a good mechanic and a boatman . On the bows of his boat he had painted in white lead the name : HOT SHOT SAVIOR . They found the girl . Her eyes were swollen and glad , but rather incredulous . " Hurry , she 's fixin ' to fall , " said Pauly . Jefferson began to yodel : 0 de ole lady ! De ole lady who-o-o-o-o ! They made fast to the tree and took . in the girl and her goat . " Thanksa , " she murmured , and sat on a bench , sedately pulling down her skirts and folding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goat slipped about in the boat , uttering its soft dainty meh-eh-eh-eh-chl and falling to its knees when a sharp turn was made among the niggertown chimneys . " Better be milkin ' that nanny ! " Ed shouted . " She 's leakin ' on you ! Where 's your folks at , Brown ? " Ed was always hoping they would rescue a girl whose father and brothers had been drowned . " Gross de river , I reckonsa , " she answered in a far-away tone . She held the goat by the horn and softly caressed its wet rump . She looked straight ahead , whispering , " Jesus knew ! Jesus knew ! " Ed tossed her the rusty bailing-can and she milked without a word . Ed craned his neck to see into the pocket of her lowered bosom . Pauly kept examining the lush treetops where melancholy hens peered through the leaves . Pauly was an old man . " Say , where do you aim to go from here ? " Ed shouted to the girl . " The Delta Arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with mischievous eyes . The girl looked up and her soft eyes widened . On her still whispering lips a mechanical smile came , then died . She started milking again and thanking Jesus . Ed winked to Pauly . " Hey Brown ! " Ed yelled . " Tell us where you think you goin ' ! " " Do n't knowsa , " the girl responded without looking up . " Some place dry , I reckonsa , if yous de Raid Cross . " Ed dragged a comb through his frizzly hair and wiped the engine . They could tell how the streets were laid out by the ranks of roofs , each roof making a V-shaped rift in the water , creating the illusion in the stillness that the water was stationary andthe roofs moved north in unison . " You goin ' some place dry , all right ! " Ed bellowed . " Gooden dry , " said Pauly . Ed said , " You know where we 're fixin ' to take you ? Over the river to the convict camp . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad rascals with the striped Iaigs , come from under the jail to bag the levee . " The girl looked at Ed , for the first time actually attentive . She had rather proud lips and breasts  --  young , with the clear-eyed gravity in her face of a recent successful baptism . " They needin ' somebody to cook their greens over there , " Ed went on casually now , " an ' wash them striped britches . Warden say , ' Find me a willin ' an ' a pretty girl ai n't scared of convicts , because my gun-robbers is gettin ' hongry and lonesome at night in these tents atop of the levee . ' Yard We been lookin ' for you all day , Brown . They ai n't goin ' to hit you in that camp . Not a nice girl like you . What 's your name ? " " Ella McCoy . " " Why that 's a drudge . She named after a drudge-boat , Pauly ! " The girl watched Ed 's serious face . She was weeping inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big globular tears hanging in the sun . " Mind out where you 're steerin ' , Ed ! " Pauly warned . " Listen , lil nigger , he 's only jokin ' you ! " Ed chuckled richly and stamped his feet . The girl dumped her can of milk over the side , and began to sob pitifully . Ed 's eyes grew kind . " Now I 'll tell you sho-nuff where you gain ' ! " said Ed . " You gain ' to the big ark , an ' see the lights from Baton Rouge and smell the refinery , an ' eat you some boar-jowl and clabber . Git you a pretty new refugee dress an ' some typhoid serums . You love boar-jowl ? " " Massa . " " Fair enough . " They ducked their heads to pass under some telephone wires . A boat went by with a man grinding a camera at them ; and one of its occupants shouted to Ed that the Bubber Joe refugees had been brought in . Ed 's boat curved out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulence the crevasse had strangely allayed , it was a glorious rosy evening . Their engine spat a nice row of vapor balls , exactly spaced , that remained fixed behind them for a long time , reddened by sun . The east shore lay free from water , calm russet fields melting out into the horizon 's bluish haze . And hunched gleaners crept there among the pale strips of lettuce , all heedless of the flood across the way , as if they did not yet know . Ed said to the girl , " Now you find you somebody on the ark to mind your goat to-night like a good girl . We do n't want to be bothered by no nanny-goat when we walk down the dark levee , me and you . " The girl , jerked from a reverie , looked up quickly , then lowered her eyes , regarding her folded hands . " Yassa , " she answered . " You understan ' now , Brown ? You goin ' to treat me white ? " 4 The girl stroked the goat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He asked , " Who was it save your life an ' you was fixin ' to fall in the tree yonder ? Did you ever seen me before ? " " I see you to de fiMn ' station in town , Cunnel Jessup Fillin ' Station . " " Correct ! Now who was it save your life yonder ? " Part of a baseball park fence passed , then some sodden bags of oats waltzing slowly and sprouting oats through the seams . Ed contemplated the floating baseball scoreboard lazily . " Tell me who done that , Brown ? An ' who save you from the striped-laigged convicts ? " " You an ' de yutha gentleman . " She looked at old Pauly . " An ' I 'm in charge of the boat . " " Yassa , I expect so . " " An ' we do n't want no nanny-goat aroun ' . Was n't suppose to save no goat , nohow . Goin ' to catch hell . " " Yassa . " Ella looked away , moving her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pauly . The refugee barge , blacker than the shore , bore several tents with torchlight shining through the flaps . Neighborly aromas floated out to Ella , frying pork and collards boiling . A rope flung through the dark fell across the goat . " One female colored ! " Ed called . " Christ ! where 'll we put her ? " cried a doctor who needed shaving . " Go on , then , report her for inoculation . All right , open up , folks ! " A group gathered round . " Where yall from , Cap ? Weber 's Landin ' ? " " Chunky ? Dat you Chunky ? " " They got a goat ! Look the nanny-goat , honey ! " " Make them shut that radio . Woman in labor in that doctor-tent ! " " Denner for whites ! Denner ready for whites ! Sengle file , folks , sengle filer " Ella did not know anyone . She gave the goat to a boy and hunted food . Ed had told her to wait for him behind the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , nor she the crowd . To her they were like the stars of heaven for multitude  --  everybody talking , one big voice , like the groans of the slain , except some were laughing . And a preacher somewhere was holding prayer . It was all magic , sad , wonderful . Ella was sixteen . She had read the Bible , and hoped soon to become an Upper Virgin in the Watchers of the Double Cave . She studied the calm black waters . A flood works softly , softly , mantling the meadows in cool fluid sorrow . Men nearby were discussing the drowned cows and inundated crops . Women round a charcoal furnace drank coffee , blowing into the huge tin cups before each sip , anxiously glancing at the tent where the woman was having the baby . Ella crossed her hands on her bosom and listened to the unknown preacher . He was telling his hearers to pray for the white folks who had saved them alive , or Jesus might still deliver them up to blood or set them down somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight . " Ready to go down the levee ? " One of his hands found the firm bulge of hip clothed in the new gingham dress . " Yassa . When you say . " They started for the gangway , but Ed saw some men assembled there . " Listen , you know how to count ? " he asked Ella . " Yassa . " " I 'll go first . When I reach shore you begin countin ' slow . When you reach a hundred , come on ashore and down the levee . I 'll be waitin ' in them pin oaks . " His hand prowled up and rested in the deep warm hollow between her shoulder blades  --  trembling . " Look , do n't you gyp me , now ! You wo n't gyp me ? " " Nawsa . " " Swear ? " " Yassa . " " What do you swear to , Brown ? " " Jesus . " When Ella had counted past eighty the Coastguard boat came quickly to take the colored people to the receiving station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Colored over there ! All colored ! " Ella hesitated , then hid herself behind the bath tent . A voice behind a blinding flashlight called to her , " Hey ! You colored ? " She answered " yes . " " Over this way , an ' make it snappy ! " But when the light went away she made for the shore gangway . A nurse found her and ordered her to the other side . When the nurse left Ella continued to the shore plank , but there she was brusquely directed to the river side of the barge . " Cap , I got to go asho ' . " " Cain heppit . " Ella crossed the barge and joined the negroes climbing down . She looked once over her shoulder . Far down the levee Ed was yodeling : 0 de ole lady ! De ole lady who-o-o-o-o ! The load of negroes went to Baton Rouge and were slept and fed until the water receded . Ella was sick from the serum . She stayed for a day after the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage . After she had been there several times , peering into the building of oily shadows , a mechanic asked her what she wanted . Ella hurried away but went back round the block and returned . She met the colored porter . He told her Ed Jefferson had quit the Colonel a long rime ago . He thought Ed was now with the U-Drive-It . Ella could not find Ed Jefferson . She returned to Tete Noir . She helped her old mother shovel the mud and leaves through the windows . The mattress was ruined , the chairs warped , the bureau drawers would not come out . With a hatchet they demolished the bureau to get to their clothes . The Red Cross delivered flour , beans , and coffee , but no dry stove-wood could be found . They dug a few sticks from under the soft mud in the yard and put them in the sun . " Is dis house established an ' peaceful ? " called the preacher from his mule . " Yes , Revvin ! " " Praise de livin Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ella 's mother said , " Ella chile , take yo bath soon in de mawnin ' and hunt you somethin ' to do on de big road . I got sad visions . " Ella , " Yes , mam , I better start for town . A Raid Cross lady to de station promise me a job of work . " " What size job of work ? " " A fried-potato job . Her husband sell fried potatoes . They cooks in de showcase on Reflection Street . " " An ' mind out you do n't go ' bout no evil in town , bringin ' down my gray hairs with sorrow to hell . " Until a late hour every night Ella McCoy worked in the show window on Reflection Street . The potato-chipping machine opened and closed like a polished fist ; and next to it an oval vat of golden oil bubbled over blue tongues of gas . There was a salt shaker big enough for a giant , and a stack of waxed bags labeled : HOSTESSPUDS . The hostesses themselves came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honked their horns . Ella would run to the curb attired in blue and gray , the company 's colors , and wearing her silver star between her breasts . In a month she made enough money to send her mother the cost of new house furnishings and two settings of Minorca eggs . Ella left her job on a rainy day , took a bath , and went round to various garages . She found Ed next morning early . He was entering the Triangle Better Service Station . Walking fast , he winked at Ella and kept on into the garage . Suddenly he hastened back to the sidewalk . " Holy Christ ! Say , you look different . Do n't you know me ? " " Yassa , Mr. Aid . " She allowed herself to be led into the dark building behind a car . " Trying to slip by me , Brown ? " the man asked . " You done forget who save your life ? Ca n't you kiss me ? " " Yassa . " " I 'm kissin ' , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long you be in town ? What was your name ? " " Long as you wants , I reckonsa . Ella McCoy . " Ella stayed in Baton Rouge several days longer . Jefferson had a car , or rather a yellow truck chassis with a seat and no body . They would drive down the river road and fool round the woods or levee . Once Ella lost her silver star . She was so concerned that Ed the next day cast her another star from an old main bearing of a caterpillar tractor . " I better be gettin ' home , " she said , " if you satisfied . " " I 'd like to know who 's stoppin ' you ! " said Ed . " You think I 'm crazy about a woman watches the mail plane while she 's makin ' love ? " Back home in Tete Noir , Ella changed the shelf-paper and whitewashed the fence . Each night with her mother she prayed at the fireplace to Jesus who was so kind . One day the Watchers of the Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the people were leaving church , after several reluctant attempts , Ella approached the preacher . " Revvin , plcasa , when can I get to hang my sacred star on de outside my dress ? " She wanted to become a Virgin , and also , the babbitt metal star had made a sore between her breasts . The preacher said , " Not untel you becomes a Upper Virgin . You takes dat degree when you reaches seventeen without willin ' sin through de flesh of thy body . Now ! Is you seventeen ? " Ella thoughtfully traced semicircles in the dust with her toe . " Is you seventeen , Ella ? " " Yes , Revvin , Monday was a week . " The preacher pinched her chin . " Well now you just go in de vestry an ax Sister Orelia instruc ' you . De Double Cave convokes a month from to-day . It 'll cost you fo ' bits , and you wants to spade you a flower garden fo ' de altar right away , an ' Jesus bless yo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon on the gallery she stitched thoughtfully at a dress . The niggertown people now were happier than before the flood  --  husbands and wives miraculously reunited after a stimulating separation ; every able man employed on the new levee ; and in the flood-enriched gardens rows of vegetables sprouting crisply . Of the nasty flood no vestige remained but a dry brown line drawn at the same height on every wall or tree . After some days Ella became restless and forced herself to visit Sister Orelia , to learn whether the circumstances of her transgression were excusable enough to permit of her becoming an Upper Virgin . The old crone with her pipe was sorry , but nothing could be done . However , if she wished , Ella might be admitted to the Cave as a Lower Virgin . If she decided to do that Ella must be sponsored by a guardian angel , a girl under seventeen whose heart was free from willing sin . If and when the guardian angel attained seventeen without sin , then both would be admissible as Upper Virgins . Ella decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , became pretty blue and empty . In the night she sat on the gallery until the roosters crowed in the fog . So she began to think of a possible sponsor . Among the Tete Noir girls was one named Gladys , of fourteen years , who was known to be free from willing sin . Ella did not care much for Gladys . She went to see her . Ella worked around slantways to the topic of the Double Cave . " I 'm goin ' in de Cave nex ' month , " Gladys said , " guarding angel fo ' mysecond cousin . Six people wants me to sponsor them . This place done run out of sponsors is de trouble . " Ella returned to her gallery and folded her hands . About this time some new people moved next door to Ella , city people , a man , woman , and child . The man , called Flip , was a chauffeur for a levee engineer . He was big and sophisticated and tough , of the peculiar dark oily color known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently . It seemed a certain man , former admirer of the wife , had followed them to Tete Noir . Ella saw Flip stand for hours at the corner , watching his house with his long legs crossed in the shape of a figure four . The child , six years old , was named Rancie . She was afraid of nothing but her father . Even then , when Flip came home to beat his wife 's head , Rancie , hiding in the blackberry bushes , would throw handfuls of green berries toward the house and whisper in a voice deep as a man 's , " Big ugly mule-bear ! Big mule-bear youl " She was skinny , black as treachery , and wore only a pair of gray drawers . Her chest was sunken and her feet huge , incredibly thick , as if the flesh of her legs had softened and run down there . She kept her bits of colored glass and other playthings in the blackberry bushes ; and from the window Ella saw Rancie crawl from the bushes without sign of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ella was a long time coaxing Rancie to be friends , because the child was wild and shy . Ella prayed for Rancie and gave her table scraps ; and for a time was able to forget about the Double Cave . Flip kept his wife 's street clothes locked up ; but one day the woman picked the lock . She went out somewhere and shortly after her return Flip drove up in his boss ' car , came JESUS in , and found his woman all dressed up . Flip spread his legs in the doorway , making a long triangular shadow on the floor in the setting sun . He put his thumb in his belt and began to grin , not a bit surprised . Then he took out his thirty-eight and said , " Stop me of you done heard this story befo ' , " and shot the woman in the face . Ella , next door , yelled and jumped the fence that she had never before been able to climb , and ran for the blackberry bushes . Rancie was just crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sugar ! " whispered Ella . " Jesus heppusl " And she took Rancie home . The night after Ella went to court she and Rancie sat hand in hand on Ella 's gallery . " Who was it save yo ' life yonder ? " Ella asked . " You save my life ! " " You goin ' to treat me white , Sugar ? " " Yassam . " " You goin ' to be my little guarding angel and march aside of me in de nice procession , and live wid me untel I 'm old and full of days ? " " Yas , mom , Miss Ella ! " But Ella did not know how to break the news to her mother . Next morning at breakfast table she said to Rancie , " Rancie , Sugar , tell yo ' new grammaw what you wants to do for Ella savin ' yo ' life yonder . " " I wants to be a little guarding angel in de procession . " " What 's all dis ? " asked the old woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But you 's a Upper Virgin , Ella ! " " Nome . Lower . " Ella dipped the cornbread into her bowl of molasses . The older woman went slowly round the table and took Ella 's cornbread and syrup away from her and carried it out back to the hog . Ella got up and began to gather her belongings . The mother remained in the back yard until she heard the front door slam softly . Ella and Rancie stayed in the woods one night , but the next morning they found an abandoned shack on the front of town , high up where the water would never rise . They managed to get the furniture from Flip 's house , which nobody wanted , and Ella cut scalloped shelf-paper from rotogravure sections and whitewashed the fence . She at once spaded up her flower garden for the altar and found washing to do for white people , a bundle each day . Ella got in the Double Cave on a pretty Sunday morning when the grass was all wet and the tulip trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Lower ones . The procession trudged the snaky dirt road , and at the cemetery prayers were said over the graves of two or three departed Virgins . Returning to church , they marched past the homes of the three Chief Upper Matrons , each of whom was clad in white robes and golden stars , waiting to come outside and give out a blessing . The last of the matrons visited was Ella 's mother . The preacher gave the Five Knocks and went in to fetch hcr . She covered her face and came out calling the ritual greeting , " Who pilgrims this house on the Lord 's morning ? " The Virgins chanted together , " Eleven Virgins pure , and crave your deep blessing , dear Matron ! " Ella 's mother was looking fixedly at Ella , whose headdress was put on improperly , needing adjustment . The preacher began prompting the Matron in a croaking whisper , " My blessing ? " " My blessing I freely give ! Go forth and tend the bud of renown . An ' mind out yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So Ella at last became a Virgin , one of the hardest things to do . Thenceforth she worked hard and minded her own business and took good . care of her little guardian angel . The two lived in peace , bothered by no one , and the garden bore flowers of four colors , and the hens grew tame , coming up to pick at Ella 's shoe . Her burden grew small and vanished , gentler than the wind takes a patch of snow . Not even Ed Jefferson disturbed them very much when he came one fail day looking for Ella . When she saw the yellow truck with a seat and no body , Ella called Rancie from the kitchen . Rancie had a stick of sugar cane in her hand . " I was passing by here , " Jefferson explained . " Been huntin ' you all over town , includin ' the graveyard . The sexton sent me to the preacher and the preacher sent me here . You know all the big shots . Say , ai n't you all got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair . " Rancie , get the gentleman a glass of cow 's milk and some veal-meat , " she said . Ed tackled the lunch . " Your meat is tender but your knife is tough , " he said . Rancie stood in a dim corner , looking at the stranger with her big eyes shining , her finger in her mouth , and holding the sugar cane . The hens out back sang busily . " Well , I done quit the Triangle , " said Ed , wiping his mouth . Ella smiled politely and smoothed down her braided hair . Silence fell . " Em chauffeur for a rich white man now , " said Ed . Ella looked through the window . Rancie kept watching the man . Ed glanced at her , coughed , and wiped his brow . " Nice little place you all got , " he said . He glanced at Rancie , with Ella 's leaden star on her bosom . Ed reached into his pocket . " Here 's you a nickel , Sis , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cane down by the river ? You got a knife ? Brown , I could spend a Sunday here sharpenin ' knives alone . " Rancie placed the nickel in her ear . She did not move or blink . Her huge splayed feet seemed to grip the floor tightly . Ed 's eyes traveled up and down the stick of cane . He shrugged and spat in the fireplace . Ed sauntered over to peer into the kitchen , then crossed to Ella . " When you comin ' back to town , Brown ? " He put his hand on the chair-back . " Hub ? " His hand wandered and rested on Ella 's shoulder skin , where there was only a thin cotton strap . Then abruptly Rancie marched over and stood beside Ella with the stalk of cane , which was twice as tall as she . She took Ella 's hand and fixed her big white eyes upon the stranger . Ed glared at the guardian angel a long time , while no sound was heard but the contented singing of hens . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , lingering at the mantelpiece to glance at a kodak picture of the procession . " Nice place you all got . I thought I 'd say hello . You look me up when you come to town . " On the porch he said , " So long , Brown . It looks like rain . " " Good-by Mr. Aid , " Ella called , " an ' thanksa for comin ' aroure . " Rancie sank to the floor and chewed on the sugar cane , tearing off long purple strips of skin . Her teeth were very strong .
