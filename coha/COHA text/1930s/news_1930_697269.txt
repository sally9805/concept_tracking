txt The Board of Estimate 's action in voting $519,000 in salary increases for 200 of the higher city officials vas criticized severely yesterday . Opponents of the increases said there undoubtedly would have been a much greater volume of denunciation if they had not been approved when many of the City Administration 's most frequent critics were out of town . There was no hint of any legal action to restrain the administration from putting the salaries into effect , such as was brought unsuccessfully by the Citizens Union last December at the time of the increase in the salaries of the members of the Board of Estimate . Leonard M. Wallstein of the union said he had no comment to make at this time . The general opinion seemed to be that no court action could be successful and that the board undoubtedly had a legal right to vote the increases . Leo J. , assistant counsel of the union , indicated that his organization did not see its way clear to take action . " We have not taken action and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy displayed in bringing up the schedules without their presence on the calendar is just a part of our political system here . " Thomas Assails Increases . Criticism of the increases and of the fact that they were voted without previous appearance on the Board of Estimate calendar was made by Norman Thomas , Socialist candidate for Mayor last Fall , and by William H. Allen , director of the Institute for Public Service . There also was an indication that a group of inspectors in the various city departments , who were told recently by Charles L. Kohler , budget director , that the city had no money to provide salary increases for them , would attack the Board of Estimate for increasing the salaries of highly paid city officials while denying increases to poorly paid groups . None of these inspectors would speak for publication for fear of disciplinary action , but it was said that an official of the State Federation of Labor , who is not in the city 's employ , would speak for them on his return to the city tomorrow . The Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its meeting on Tuesday . This will be a bitter pill , it was said , for some of : he Democratic Aldermen who have Seen resentful since they failed , to ; et an increase at the time the saliries of the Estimate Board were - aised . The Democratic majority in : he Board of Aldermen , however , is ! ontrolled completely by Tammany ind its allied Democratic organizations in the other four boroughs , and io difficulty is expected in passing he salary increase resolution alhough opposition and some caustic miticism is expected from Joseph lark 3d , leader of the Republican ninority of four members . Asks Aldermen to Veto Rises . Mr. Thom s , who is cochairman Lf the Socialist party 's committee In public affairs , sent a letter to the 3oard of Aldermen asking that body Lot to concur in the salary increases nd asserting that the method emiloyed fly the Board of Estimate in rutting through the salary increases lade budget hearings a farce . " The Board of Estimate has preented you an amazing opportunity o justify your worth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Thomas Grote . " The increases are not justified in hemselves . We are in a period of and times . Salaries are falling , not ising . It is no time for a general icrease in the salaries of *ell-paid fficials at the expense of tax and ent payers , many of whom are Drely troubled to meet their current ills . It should be observed that either the Board of Estimate nor our board has yet established even 1,500 annually as a minimum wage Dr city employes . " The city has not done one single ling to meet the concrete suggesons for the relief of the tragic rmy of the unemployed which I rid others have made to the Board I Estimate on behalf of the Socialt party and the emergency corn'Mee of trade unionists . Yet more than half a million dollars is Voted out of hand to officials already free from financial worry , " The increases are not justified by the special services of the men receiving them .

Perhaps the Mayor has reached even his limit in keeping Chairman Walsh in office without increasing has salary . " The increase , above all , are not justified because of the manner in which they were made . They were made off the budget secretly without public hearing . This is flagrant and deliberate misgovernment . Supposedly we are operating on a budget system . This makes a joke of the budc'et . The Mayor and others have criticized citizens for not appearing at budget hearings . Actions like this make the budget hearings a solemn farce . " Allen Charges Misrepresentation . Mr. Allen declared that the salary increases were put through by " misrepresentation as well as by stealth . " He asserted that many of the officials affected had received other salary increases and compared their new salaries with those they received in 1926 . " The $500 increase announced for the Deputy City Clerk is $2,500 above what he received four years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief clerk of the City Court Is $3,500 above four years ago . The increase for the secretary of the Board of Estimate is not $2,000 but $4,500 . The increase for the Mayor 's secretary is not $3,000 but $8,000 . The increase for the Mayor 's assistant is not $5,500 but $8,500 . " Mr. Kohler admitted that the figures cited by Mr. Allen were correct , but denied that there had been any misrepresentation , as the salary increases for the , last four years had all been made public . " The officials mentioned by Mr. Allen are the backbone and sinew of our City Government , " Mr. Kohler said . " Even now they are not getting as much as they are worth to the city or could earn in private employment .
