txt Declaring he did not believe in civil liberties for any one working for the overthrow of the government , Mayor Frank Hague advocated today a concentration camp in Alaska for native " Reds , " deportation from the United . States of alien radicals and suppression of free speech and other constitutional rights for all in this category . The Mayor also included advocates of Fascist or Nazi revolutions among his candidates for exile . He urged other public officials throughout the United States to follow his lead in his war against Communists and all " subversive " elements . The Mayor testified for more than four hours on the second day of his appearance as a witness in the suit brought by the C. I. 0 . and the American Civil Liberties Union before Federal Judge William Clark for an injunction against repressive measures by the Jersey City authorities and police .

Exhibits Power of " Boss " For the most part he sat back relaxed with his long fingers clasped in front of him and spoke in a low but clear and measured tone , like one explaining something persuasively but patiently . At critical periods he displayed the dominating personality that has helped make him Democratic leader of New Jersey and " boss " of Jersey City , by leaning forward in his chair , his hawk-like features and pale blue eyes intense , with sharppointed gestures of his index finger , and by aggressively pounding in his points in arguments with opposing counsel . He even overruled John A. Matthews , his special counsel , at times when the latter attempted to interpose legal objections to C. I. 0 . questions , and the Mayor insisted on answering . Once Mr. Matthews asked the Court to direct him not to answer .

Dean Spaulding Frazer of Newark Law School , chief counsel for the plaintiffs , who subpoenaed the Mayor and made him their " star " witness against himself as chief defendant , conducted the questioning in a way that gave the Mayor free rein to expound his theory of government in the treatment of minorities . In the little fencing between lawyer and witness that went on the Mayor held up his end well , but there was small dispute about facts . In the main the examination consisted of the clash of two philosophies , Dean Frazer suggesting by his questions that the Mayor was violating the constitutional guarantees of free speech , free press and free assembly , and abvlously seeking proof of this from the Mayor 's own lips by letting him talk freely , and the Mayor insisting that Americanism and law and order , not free speech and constitutional rights , were the issue . Charges Reds Exploit Labor In a crowded court room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism and laughed at his jests , Mayor Hague amplified the charges he began last Friday against the C. I. 0. , the A. C. L. U and allied organizations as communistic . Today he charged that Communists behind the C. L 0 . were trying to get control of the American labor movement in an effort to bring about a " Red " revolution similar to those in Russia , Spain and Mexico . Pointing his finger at Morris L. Ernst , who sat at the C. I. 0 . counsel table , the Mayor declared Mr. Ernst was the real leader of this revolutionary attempt and that John L. Lewis , who he reiterated was the only C. I. 0 . leader not a Communist , had merely " assumed " command to save his position as head of the United Mine Workers . Many of the C. I. 0 . rank and file , he said , were " loyal Americans , " but had been coerced by thousands into joining , especially in the United Automobile Workers , through fear for their lives . The Mayor declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution through the American Labor party , but that this political movement had failed . Predicting that the American Labor party would be " wiped out , " he said it was " afraid " to enter a ticket in New Jersey elections and challenged it to do so , to let the voters decide between " 100 per cent Americans " and " Reds . " Against this background , he insisted , he was justified in taking the C. I. 0 . threat of an " invasion " of 3,000 men into Jersey City on last Nov. 29 as an " uprising " against the government , and in refusing permits for street meetings thereafter to the C. I. 0 . and its sympathizers under the local ordinance that gives the police discretionary power to refuse such permits when there is danger of riot , bloodshed or public disturbance . He said the people of Jersey City were so strongly aroused against the C. I. 0 . and its allies by this and subsequent " threats , " made in the press and on the radio by Mr. Ernst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. U. , and others , as to cause additional risk of violence and give further reason for denial of permits under the terms of the ordinance . The Mayor said the citizens were still in such a frame of mind as to make it dangerous to permit C. I. 0 . meetings and speeches and that he intended to continue to forbid them . As justification of his policy , he cited the riot in Newark a week ago last Saturday night , when Norman Thomas , Socialist leader , to whom the Jersey City police had refused to issue a permit was pelted with eggs and howled down by a mob . The Mayor said the Newark authorities had been " foolish " to grant a permit to Mr. Thomas in view of objections by war veterans and American Federation of Labor leaders . His policy , he declared , prevented such public disorders . Mayor Hague 's beliefs about deportations and concentration camps were stated in reply to questions by Dean Frazer , who asked whether he thought people who believed in the doctrines of Stalin. , Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' The Mayor replied they should not " go back , " but " be driven back " if they came here to oppose this government , and if they were born here , should be sent to a camp in Alaska . He said , however , that he did not believe in the use of castor oil or rubber hose against such persons , but only " lawful procedure . " In making his attack on the American Labor party as a Communist adjunct , he said many of its members had been " misled , " but would " wake up to the fact . " Admits He Decides Policies Although the Mayor reiterated that he had been misquoted by " hostile " Newspaper Guild reporters , whose affiliation with the C. I. 0 . he emphasized , in the " me ? right here " statement last December concerning who decided when there was danger of an " invasion , " he admitted he never had issued a denial of the statement and that It was true that he made such decisions . He admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in the C. I. 0 . " invasion " last November , but insisted that the police had the right to assume that a big crowd was coming , in view of published statements by William J. Carney , C. I. 0 . regional director at Newark , and to take the necessary action to prevent disorder . He said they had to let everybody know there was " law and order " in Jersey City . Mayor Hague admitted that when Dean Frazer applied in December for a permit for an A. C. L. U. street meeting to petition the City Commission to modify its ordinances on public meetings , distribution of circulars and the like , this was a proper purpose for a meeting , but asserted that in view of the Nov. 29 " uprising " the city had to be careful to prevent disorder and protect life and property . Protests from veterans ' and civic organizations , he added , caused the city to decide it was time to " suppress these meetings for the present . " The Mayor admitted that the crowds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others who gathered in Journal Square and Pershing Field on three occasions to prevent speeches by Mr. Thomas and Representatives O'Connell and Bernard had had no permit , but said they were " private citizens " and there was " no necessity " for a permit in such a case . No Curbs Before " Uprising " He said Messrs . Thomas , Baldwin , O'Connell , Bernard , Carney , Ernst and others to whom permits were denied were objectionable as " Reds , " and defined a " Red " as a " Communist . " He admitted that Mr. Thomas and Mr. Baldwin had spoken and the Socialist and Communist parties had held meetings in Jersey City without causing disorders , but said all these instances were before the Nov. 29 " uprising " had stirred up " unrest . " Moreover , he said , their prior speeches were mostly at indoor meetings , where it was comparatively easy for the police to keep order . The Mayor seized on evidence that he had formerly granted permits to Socialists and Communists to declare that " Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that he wanted the country to know this . Mayor Hague disagreed with Dean Frazer 's suggestion that the veterans and others who objected to the C. I. 0 . and A. C. L. U. meetings would have remained quiet and refrained from violence if the Mayor had publicly appealed to them . He said they were too much incensed and that he saw no occasion for him to try to calm them . Asked if he did not think it was his duty to do so , he replied that it was his duty to do what was most beneficial to the city . Dean Frazer asked if he did not think it the duty of the police to protect people who ' tried to express views disapproved by the people of the city , but the Mayor replied that it depended on what they were . Asked what his attitude would be if some one advocated nazism , the Mayor said the city never opposed qwq
