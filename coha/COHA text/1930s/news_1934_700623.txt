" " This tour is just the start of an offensive by our office , " Mr. Straus said later .

In order to check wage violations a special auditing department makes a daily study of the books of many industries concerning which complaints have been received . The investigators have discovered a number of tricks by which employers manage to cut wages while at the same time attempting to present the appearance of full compliance with code regulations . 1 Among them are : Hiring experienced workers at the wages of apprentices ; deducting part of the wages as dues for so-called " beneficial projects " ; " punching out " employes on the time clocks at 4:30 P. M. , the regular closing hour , only to have them return to work directly afterward ; and contracting outside work at code prices and then forcing the contractors to take a much lower price when the work has been finished .

In all cases the names of complainants are kept secret as it may mean the loss of their jobs . Conversely , the mere revelation of the fact that a complaint has been filed against an employer may arouse adverse public opinion which might be disastrous to his business . " The time of educating the employer is at end . Now ' it is up to the employer to uphold the hands of the President in bringing about recovery through the rules laid down by the NRA .
