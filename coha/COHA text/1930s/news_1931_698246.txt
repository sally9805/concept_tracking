txt The coming of M. LAVAL to confer with President HOOVER is an event the international significance of which should not be lost sight of in the official ceremonies of welcome to the Premier of France . No trifling errand could have brought him across the Atlantic . His visit is much more than one of courtesy . While he has done no thundering in the index , he has made it perfectly clear that he is hoping to find a basis of cooperation with the United States in dealing not only with the present crisis but with hopes and fears for the future . Whatever other subjects he may discuss with the President , it . is certain that he will not omit a joint study with Mr. HOOVER of the Disarmament Conference set for next February . In this respect , M. LAVAL 'S journey to America may be compared with that of RAMSAY MACDONALD two years ago : He came to pave the road for the London Naval Conference . That turned out to be only a partial success , the results of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a larger  --  and more universal plan of naval limitation for which M. LAVAL hopes to prepare the way . There was implied reference to this in his well-conceived address to Mayor WALKER yesterday . The first Minister of France emphasized her intense longing for peace , but also said that she could not sever this from a desire to be secure . How can security be guaranteed to France and other nations that feel it necessary to arrange for defense against the possible aggression of a stronger power ? The method has been more than once suggested by the French Government . It was plainly stated in the memorandum submitted by it to the naval conference of 1930 . It was put into a convenient phrase in the statement of France sent to a disarmament conference in England not . long ago , declaring that the one thing needful is " the organization of peace . " This is not merely a French whim . The French are a logical and doctrinaire people who like to see everything reduced to an exact formula and set down in black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sound idea . It is that the world will not be saved from war merely by noble protests and ardent lip-service of peace . It is not enough that fine sentiments be expressed . They must be written into treaties that make sure of aspiration being translated , when the need arises , into action . Specifically , what the French have asked before , and what . M. LAVAL Will doubtless request from President ? HOOVER , is an assurance that the United Stated will not again stand aloof in a kind of proud sense of national self-sufficiency when there is a threat of war on a large scale . In other words , France feels the need of supplementing the Briand-Kellogg , treaty . She would ask the American Government to agree to that " consultative pact " which Secretary STIMSON at one time , when in London , seemed disposed to accept for ? his Government , but which afterward ..

Our State Department , without being formally under ' a treaty obligation to do so , has at least twice made telling use of the Briand-Kellogg pact . The Government at Washington has , in fact , consulted with other nations , though it had given no binding promise to do so . It has , in successive emergencies , moved in such a way as to show not only that it is against war and wishes to throw its full influence against it , but is ready to check and stop , if possible , any aggressor . Now , if we . stand prepared to do these things , why refuse to pledge ourselves to do them ? This is the question that the French have asked of us , and will continue to ask , until they get an answer . If our Government really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world , not merely to talk peace but to organize it , the French Premier will not be sent away from Washington empty-handed .
