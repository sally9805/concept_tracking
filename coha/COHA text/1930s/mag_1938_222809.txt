Main problem facing the Government of chub-cheeked President Lzaro Crdenas is to find revenues with which to operate . When Mexico four months ago expropriated the British and U. S.-owned oil industry , the Government lost one out of every 15 pesos of Federal income which had come from oil taxes . So far the former foreign-owned oilfields , now Government operated , have proved a liability . British and U. S. purchases of Mexican oil have dried up . Virtually the only oil the country has disposed of has been several hundred thousand barrels delivered to Germany in return for German machinery . <P> As a result storage tanks are full , wells are capped , and grumbling workers have taken pay cuts . To quiet unrest , President Crdenas , accompanied by his little-seen brother , Alberto , and a trainload of loyal followers , toured the affected areas . Last week the President extended his trouble-shooting activities to the once-productive Tuxpan area . <P> Another sizable loss of revenues , springing out of the expropriations , was the cancellation of the U. S. Treasury arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican Government . Since then Mexican silver , largely mined by U. S. concerns , has been regularly shipped to Manhattan where the Treasury has purchased it in open market at its current price of 43 an ounce . From these shipments , however , the Mexican Government has realized only a 5.5% tax . <P> Last week , to balance the budget deficit caused by the loss of oil and silver revenues , the Crdenas Government decreed a 12% tax on all exports . Since more than 70% of Mexico 's exports are minerals and metals , the burden will thus fall on the U. S. mining concerns , which will be forced to pay the tax before they can get their products to the U. S. market . U. S. interests were further hit when the Government established a semi-permanent limitation on Mexico 's imports , 65% of which are supplied by the U. S.
