txt A parade of labor pickets for the second successive Sunday before Grace Episcopal church in Whitestone , Queens , reached a critical stage today when members of the congregation decided to " escort the pickets out of town . " However , at the insistence of the rector , the Rev. Ernest Sinfield , the congregation agreed to an attitude of moderation . Feeling has been intense at the church , one of the oldest in Queens , since pickets first appeared during construction of a new parish hall adjoining the church . The pickets wore banners declaring that the construction concern was " unfair to union labor . " In his sermon the Rev. Mr. Sinfield said he was " generally sympathetic with the unions , " but he would not permit the church to be " dictated to by a group of men from all parts of New York City . "
