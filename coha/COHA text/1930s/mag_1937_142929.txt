To Premier Dr. Milan Stoyadinovich , six members of his Cabinet , and 141 Deputies , it occurred last week that they might have to become Jews , Moslems , Catholics or Protestants . Though all strictly belonged to the Serbian Orthodox Church , they had been " excommunicated " as result of an Orthodox-Government row . The Orthodox Church disapproved of the Government 's recently coming to terms with the Vatican ; seemed to suspect moreover that the Government had had a hand in the death of the Orthodox Patriarch , His Holiness Varnava ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) . The Premier 's problem was urgent because under Yugoslavia 's Constitution , Ministers and Deputies must belong to one or other of the country 's five religious communities . <P> Day after the Patriarch 's funeral tension had become so great that the Premier bolted from the capital to Brod where Prince Paul , the chief Regent , was vacationing . In an effort to cause the Premier the maximum embarrassment , the Orthodox Holy Synod this week ordered him back to Belgrade to stand trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church Court .
