THE Tennessee Valley has no big cities but a hundred county seats . These valley towns differ , as the seven valley states differ , in history and character ; but more interesting than their local color is the fact that arrested Southern economy has preserved intact various stages of economic progress , each of which may be almost perfectly exemplified in some one town . To consider in turn Tupelo , Mississippi , Huntsville , Alabama , and Kingsport , Tennessee , is to range all the way from rugged individualism through decadent capitalism to streamlined industrial planning , or ' from feudalism to fascism in three hard lessons . Tupelo , Mississippi , is called " the TVA city " by the local chamber of commerce . In 1933 Congressman John E. Rankin persuaded his home town to plug in government power , and now it is known throughout the country as the satisfied first customer of TVA current . Mr. Rankin admits that it took some argument , but argument in Tupelo is simple because you can do most of it with one man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tupelo Cotton Mills , or the president of the Tupelo Garment Company , or the president of the Citizens ' Bank of Tupelo ; or suppose you had business with the Tupelo Brick and Tile Company , or with R. D. Reed and Company , the Main Street department store  --  in each case you would ask for Mr. Rex Reed . Or you might be interested in the local hospital , or the Red Cross , or the Tupelo Rotary Club , or have an inquiry for the state board of public welfare ; again the best man to see would be Mr. Rex Reed . Of course there are other business men in Tupelo , a town with a population of some 6,000 , and others who believe with Mr. Reed that the road to success is service , but there is not much business , public or private , that is not somehow connected with the Reed enterprises . It was rumored that the Tupelo Cotton Mills saved $18,000 on their power bills the first year they had TVA power . Norman Thomas wondered out loud if companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on their savings to their workers . The answer was given at Tupelo : just about the time the cotton mill counted its savings , the Supreme Court invalidated the NRA ; so wages instead of being raised were lowered . This was hard , because the workers in the cotton mills lost money in another way when TVA power was plugged in . They lived in company houses , and since their lights were on the company line , they had paid atthe industrial rate-50 cents a month . For TVA power they paid the regular residential rate , with a 75-cent minimum . Electricity was cheaper now for everybody else in the town but two bits higher for them . The two bits counted . With a $4,000 weekly pay roll , the mill had 400 employees ; you can figure the average wage for a forty-six-hour week . In the spring of 1937 , when everybody was doing it , the mill workers had the spunk to start a sitdown strike . Jimmy Cox , a machinist in the mill for seven years , was the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about , but he was young and hopeful . They asked for a 15 per cent raise in wages and a forty-hour week . Of course they did n't stand a chance to get it . The mill offered to compromise on 10 per cent , but it was n't to be a raise ; it would have to be a bonus at Christmas . And the management would n't reduce hours at all . As the strike started in April , Christmas seemed a long way off ; so Jimmy Cox , with a two-to-one vote to back him , stood pat . The management said that if the workers were going to be ugly about it , they would have to shut down the ' mill . Last summer the mill building , with a square tower like a feudal fort , was still shut . Southern workers do not break windows , and the glass was therefore still intact . But scarlet trumpet vines were holding the fort , and on the door a card read , " This property is now in the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi . " The mill cottages on the streets between the railroad tracks and the cotton fields bore the same placards . When evictions were tried during the strike , Jimmy Cox asked the Red Cross for tents because the mill workers had joined the Red Cross by a pay-roll checkoff , bit Mrs. Rex Reed , the Lee County chairman , ha &; no tents available . Nobody could say what the people lived on , for there is no " home relief , " as Northerners know it , in Mississippi . Congressman Rankin , in Washington , charged that the National Labor Relations Board was " conspiring with communistic influences to destroy Southern industries , " and that " the ruthless manner in which they helped to destroy and forced the liquidation of the cotton mill in Tupelo , throwing all the employees out of work , and the brutal manner in which they are now trying to destroy the garment factories in that city is enough to stir the people of my state to revolt . " After the cotton-mill strike a loud-speaker was put in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls how well off they were and that unions were not to be trusted . But wages were as low as $5 a week , and some of the girls were discontented enough to listen to Tupelo 's first outside organizer . Ida Sledge came from one of the best families in Memphis , but she had been corrupted by Wellesley and social work . So Miss Sledge was asked to leave Tupelo by a committee of loyalists from Reed Brothers , and actually escorted out of town by a group of local business men . It may be embarrassing for Southern gentlemen to have to treat a lady in this fashion , but Southern papers , discussing Tupelo 's trouble , had referred to the Wellesley girl as " an influx of C. I. 0 . agitators . " When the girls who had joined the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union lost their jobs , they appealed to the Labor Board  --  and Tupelo got busy organizing company unions . Members of the Chamber of Commerce , the City Council , and the Kiwanis formed a Citizens ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner at the Hotel Tupelo , and a barbecue at the Legion hut ; the mayor , issued a statement against agitators ; and the sheriff announced his determination to " protect Tupelo 's industries from outsiders . " City ordinances sought to discourage distribution of union circulars , and both papers refused union advertising ; the Tupelo News gritted its teeth over the need to keep " the virgin Southland free from a communistic organization , " and dared the Labor Board to invade Dixie . Both papers printed the page advertisements of the Tupelo Garment Company urging industrial " cooperation " by all " true , red-blooded Americans . " The citizens telegraphed Congressman Rankin and Senator Pat Harrison demanding defeat of the wage-hour law and congratulated Congressman Rankin when he warned Washington that the streets of Southern towns might be " stained with the blood of innocent people as a result of the activities of these irresponsible representatives of the so-called Labor Relations Board . " The nearest thing to bloodshed in Tupelo was the experience of Jimmy Cox . Tupelo was Jimmy 's home town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reed 's ; he had taken civil-service examinations and was first on the list of eligible substitutes at the Tupelo post office . The cotton mill had been in receivership for a year . One day as he was walking along the streets a car drove up and a man told him to get in . Since another car was behind , with twelve men in the two , there was no use arguing . They took Jimmy twenty miles out into the country , tied a rope around his neck , and started to tie the other end to the rear axle of the first car . He talked them out of that , or maybe they were just trying to scare him ; at any rate they stretched him over a log instead and beat him with their belts . The people who took care of him afterward said he was pretty badly hurt ? it was feared he might lose an arm . He had to go for13 treatment to the new hospital , dedicated shortly before by Mr. Rex Reed . That was last spring . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had company unions , and more than twenty girls had been fired for membership in the I. L. G. W. U. Or so the union was prepared to prove by depositions taken in the Holiness Church . Since the Tupelo courthouse was not available for the NLRB hearing ? " Tupelo do n't want no riffraff in its courthouse , " explained the farmer husband of one of the witnesses  --  lawyers and examiner moved over to Aberdeen , the next county seat , a smaller , older town peacefully asleep under its magnolia trees . Everybody expected the hearing to last for weeks , but it was over in two days . First two , then all of the girls discharged were ordered reinstated with back pay . Company unions were ordered dissolved , with a word about unfair practices . The Labor Board works quickly in such cases because it is dealing with a familiar condition . Except for its TVA power , Tupelo resembles other little Southern towns as one houn ' dawg resembles another ; and in such little towns all over the South industrial feudalism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " girls who had saved on Coca-Colas to pay for the company union were surprised . The Tupelo Journal , announcing the result of the hearing , headlined its story " NLRB Turns Down Garment Workers ' Plea , " and quoted local opinion that the board was " under the thumb of John L. Lewis and his C. I. a unions and it was useless to expect any just verdict . " The News managed to make the decision sound favorable to the factories . During the Civil War a Yankee general who had won a little engagement near Tupelo was persuaded to retreat and leave his wounded behind . Now , after the NLRB examiner had gone back to New York , there were casualties to be counted and a similar confusion as to which side had won . The union girls had their wages and a chance to sew more TVA-brand shirts , but one garment factory and the cotton mill would stay shut . And what good does reinstatement in a job do you if the big boss and the foreladies and right-thinking people in the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without prejudice " but it ca n't enforce it . It is n't as if there were jobs enough to go round . There is no doubt about what the best people think . To learn their views you have only to attend Sunday school at Mr. Rex Reed 's church . There , the week of the hearing , the teacher of an adult class departed from the regular lesson to say what a great mistake it was to think we could substitute social service for true faith . Some churches made that mistake and some modern schools , and our President made it when he planned to regulate wages and hours of work . Tupelo is typical of that large section of the South which is willing to accept New Deal benefits , unwilling to undertake New Deal reforms . Right now , with a new reduction in rates and a profit of $40,000 on TVA power last year , it might be unsafe for anti-Administration forces to ask Tupelo to vote on a clear-cut choice between TVA plus NLRB or neither . What Tupelo wants is feudalism with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidizing school manufacture of hosiery , TVA is not the only agency to be made an unwilling accessory to unfair enterprise . But the Tupelo labor case could have , for TVA , a greater significance than the Congressional hearings at Knoxville . The government as a manufacturer of power regulates its resale to domestic consumers ; what about its use in industry ? Congressman Rankin , one of the authors of the TVA act , insisted that passage of the wage-hour bill would mean " the end of civilization as we know it . " In Tupelo , the day after the union victory , he was happy to talk about TVA and how much the Hotel Tupelo was saving on its light bill , but he would n't discuss labor questions . He did n't , he said , know what the cotton mill had paid its people . Congressman Rankin was reelected by a comfortable majority in the fall , and there can be no doubt that he is , for Tupelo , the perfect Representative . It is less certain that it will be desirable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , in the first flush of enthusiasm over TVA achievements , voiced at Tupelo four years ago : " ' What you are doing here is going to be copied in every state in the Union . " This is the first of a series of three sketches intended to illustrate three parallel lines of development in the South today  --  the feudal town , the runaway Northern-industry town , and the " model " company town . The latter two will be described in early issues. ? EDITORS THE NATION . ) In the Wind S URVEYS INDICATE that a large percentage of newspaper readers are " headline readers .
