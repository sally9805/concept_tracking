As hope for a short war faded last week , wishful thinkers turned to a fresh hope that might bring about war 's end : the internal collapse of Germany . Outside the Reich , newspapers carried dispatch after dispatch pointing toward such a possibility . From Zurich came reports of rioting in Essen , Cologne and Dusseldorf ; from Amsterdam a report that 500 Gestapo agents had been sent to put down strikes in the Krupp works at Essen . In Austria , Tyroleans were reported to have distributed 1,000,000 leaflets saying : " Hitler leads us to catastrophe-we want peace . " The slogan , " Down with Hitler ! Down with War ! " was reported chalked on walls in big German cities . Slovak troops on the Polish front were reported sandwiched between German troops to guard against desertion . Passive resistance was reported rife in Slovakia , Bohemia and Moravia , with former anti-Nazis being rounded up by the thousands . The British Independent Labor Party reported it had received a message from German Independent Socialists : " Hitler begins war with Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German workers do not want this war ; German peasants do not want it . . . . This war is not our war ! " <P> All these reports added up to little more than propaganda . There was no authentic evidence of revolt in Germany last week , or even of the desire to revolt . Life had merely become harder . In Berlin , where last fortnight crowds appeared stunned and silent , the crowds had disappeared . The people were too busy to stand in crowds . Women were beginning to run trams and busses as men went to the front ( during a blackout two streetcars crashed headon , injuring ten passengers ) . Women sold newspapers and delivered mail . The Nazi uniform all but disappeared from the streets and field grey took its place . The Army had taken over the country . <P> New laws mobilized 80,000,000 Germans behind the Army . In a series of drastic decrees , death by hanging was ordered for saboteurs , pillagers , arsonists , profiteers and loafers . Before officials could get the gallows up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Stammheim Herman Weisser was beheaded for stealing shell parts . Income taxes were upped by 50% , taxes on beer and tobacco by 20% . The tax on radios was made practically confiscatory and the death penalty ordered for those caught listening to foreign broadcasts . Public dancing was prohibited as incompatible with the spirit of the times . <P> Hospital trains began to arrive in Berlin and Hitler Youths were given first-aid training . But no casualty lists were published . Stories of glorious victories over the Poles gave the people something to be happy about . Secure in its belief that the defeat of Poland would be followed by peace , Germany faced its hardships last week .
