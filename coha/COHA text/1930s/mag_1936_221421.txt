In 1906 the American Medical Association was so disturbed by the condition of U. S. medical schools and by the laxity of state licensing requirements that it founded a Council on Medical Education &; Hospitals , installed the late Dr. Nathan Porter Colwell as secretary . That year Dr. Colwell went to the Carnegie Foundation , asked that a lay survey of the nation 's medical schools be made and its findings published . The Carnegie Foundation chose for the job a brilliant young educator named Abraham Flexner , who had ceased teaching in Louisville high schools to earn a Harvard M. A. With Dr. Colwell , Abraham Flexner visited U. S. medical schools , U. S. clinics , studied the by-laws of the state medical boards which licensed new practitioners . His findings he presented incisively in Medical Education the United States &; Canada , which was published in 1910 , had a wide sale and an even wider influence , shocked the U. S. public into a realization that the education of medical students was a matter of public concern . <P> Last week in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Education &; Hospitals met with the Federation of State Medical Boards for the 32nd Annual Congress on Medical Education , Medical Licensure &; Hospitals . Present were 350 elderly physicians . <P> Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , who was to have read a report from the A. M. A. Council , stayed in Palo Alto , Calif , to nurse his bronchitis . By proxy he asserted : " The most hopeless mistake . . . is that of admitting poor students to large medical school classes . One may sympathize with struggling youth but should sympathize more with future patients . " <P> To the next speaker , stout , square-jawed President George Zook of the American Council on Education , the medical men listened respectfully until they realized that he was suggesting that medical schools , like liberal arts colleges , should be allowed to certify that their graduates are fit to be doctors . Due to Abraham Flexner 's book and its effect on public opinion , 40 states will not license to practice medicine the graduates of medical schools on the A. M. A. 's blacklist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly reprimanded by brisk little Biologist Alphonse Mary Schwitalla , S. J. , dean of St. Louis University 's medical school , who pointed out that the matter was in better hands when it was divided , as at present , between the A. M. A. and the state medical boards . <P> Chief concern among medical educators of late has been the rapid growth of specialization . As the result of statistics already on hand , the powers-that-be have decided , according to Columbia University 's Medical Dean Willard Cole Rappleye , that " beginning in 1938 no physician will be listed as a specialist who does not possess a certificate from a board in his particular branch of practice . " Consonant with that idea , the A. M. A. Journal last week published a list of reliable x-ray specialists . The list was surprising , for it contained only 1,274 names for the entire country . Some communities like Des Moines have only one approved x-ray specialist .
