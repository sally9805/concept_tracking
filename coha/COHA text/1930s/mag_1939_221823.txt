Shiiki chuuluns , <P> Shiiki chuuluns shiiki shiiki shiiki , <P> Chuuluns shiiki. * <P> Thus last week sang Willie Long Bone , 71-year-old Delaware Indian , perched on a high stool , pounding a deerskin drum . Willie Long Bone sang for fun , but his audience , a seminar of the Linguistic Institute of America convened on the University of Michigan campus , plied their pencils feverishly , transcribing his words into phonetic symbols . Then for their benefit Willie translated his songs and long , chanted stories into English . <P> Reason the scribbling audience paid such close attention was that Willie Long Bone was speaking a nearly dead language . Despite a general increase in the U. S. Indian population , the number of Delawares is dwindling , and only about 40 of the oldest still speak the pure tongue . <P> One of Willie 's tales , which he learned from his grandmother and which takes hours to tell because it is replete with rich and often racy detail , concerns the tribulations of the Delawares after two women had misbehaved sexually with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for admittance " up above where he should go , " he could not get in because he was denied . That night a manitou ( spirit ) visited the Delaware chief , told him the tribe must atone for the wrong done to the bird . The manitou suggested that all the young women dance naked before all the men for four days . They started to do so , but an old woman spoiled the atonement by throwing a blanket around her granddaughter . <P> " That night " - Willie translated- " the manitou came again to the chief and . . . ordered , ' Twelve babies you bring in . Those old men sing to those babies and keep on singing to those babies until those babies starve to death . At that point you fellows quit singing . ' " <P> Again the atonement was spoiled , when a fond mother snatched her wailing baby from among the sacrificial twelve . When Willie came at last to the end of his story , he made the gesture of breaking a stick and said Ngahh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Willie Long Bone learned English at a Government school , fathered a son who graduated from Drake University . Recently Professor Charles Frederick Voegelin of DePauw University discovered Willie on his 80-acre allotment in Oklahoma , brought him to Ann Arbor for the summer session . Willie has already made some 50 phonographic recordings of Delaware songs and tales . Between performances he walks around the University of Michigan campus in faded overalls , a floppy straw hat . For his singsonging he gets $2 a day and expenses . <P> <P> * " It 's good , the bird ,
