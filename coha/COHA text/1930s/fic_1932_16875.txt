Celia takes a chair across from the desk and innocently crosses her legs , revealing a pair of attractive knees . &nbsp; MISS HICKEY ( from the dictograph ) The employment agency  --  on the other phone . &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYOh , yes . ( he snaps the dictograph off and picks up the phone ) Hello . Mr. Day speaking . In regard to that young lady you sent over yesterday  --   --  27  --  ( his eyes wander to Celia sitting in the chair and he notes her shapely legs. )  --  I want to commend you . Miss Farraday is a very charming young lady and meets fully with my retirements . Yes . Thank you . He hangs up and Celia turns to him excitedly . Day rises to his feet and comes toward her . &nbsp; CELIA FARRADAY ( rising ) Then you 're not going to let me go ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYNo , Celia. ( he takes her hand ) But you must promise me you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Day ! And thank you so much ! I  --  ( she becomes conscious that he is holding her hand a trifle ardently . She drops her eyes and pulls her hand away , suddenly embarrassed )  --  I  --  I 'll go back to my desk now . Thanks a lot , Mr. Day . ( she turns from him and starts for the door . ) &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( skeptically ) You said Kentucky , did n't you ? &nbsp; CELIA FARRADAYYes , sir . She turns and crosses to the door . Day gazes speculatively at her ankles . &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYHumm . A remarkable place  --  Kentucky . As Celia opens the door , suddenly Mr. Smith , highly incensed , pushes in , followed angrily by Hickey . Celia exits . &nbsp; MISS HICKEY ( angrily to Smith ) I do n't care if you 're Sam Smith  --  Dick Smith  --  Joe Smith or all the Smith Brothers in one !  --  you 'll wait until you 're announced .  --  28  --  &nbsp; SMITHOf all the colossal impudence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Hickey . In Mr. Smith 's case there is a need for haste . ( to Smith ) Mr. Smith , this is a pleasure . ( Hickey exits , shutting the door ) &nbsp; SMITHIt 's an outrage , sir  --  and it sounds like black-mail ! &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYTut  --  tut . That sounds like slander . ( indicating a chair ) Will you be seated , sir ? ( Smith angrily sits down and pulls a cigar from his pocket , viciously biting off the end ) You may smoke if you wish . &nbsp; SMITH ( deliberately throwing the cigar into a wastebasket ) My time is limited . I 'll thank you to come to the point . &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYMr . Smith , your concern faces a shortage of ninety thousand dollars . &nbsp; SMITHMay I ask the source of such an illusion ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYThe defaulter has confessed to me  --  retaining me to adjust the matter . &nbsp; SMITHDefaulter ? What 's his name ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYJust a moment .

( he nonchalantly gathers some papers together ) It 's rather a pity to wait and let the State Auditors convince you , but since you ask it  - -  -  &nbsp; SMITHBut confound it , man  --  what evidence have you ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYOnly a portion of the missing funds , which , in your present condition , I see will not impress you . ( he rises politely ) And now , Mr. Smith , knowing your time is limited  --  &nbsp; SMITH ( whipped ) Wait . You spoke of restitution ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( nods ) In part . &nbsp; SMITHIn part ? How much ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYUnfortunately Barton speculated and lost some of the ninety thousand . He offers to restore what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAYTo be exact  --  thirty thousand dollars . &nbsp; SMITH ( rising angrily ) One third ! Absurd ! I wo n't consider it ! Barton shall go to jail !  --  30  --  &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYQuite right . But in times like these , I am surprised a man of your foresight considers it wise to think only of Barton . &nbsp; SMITHWho else should I think of ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( beautifully ) Your stock and bond customers ! The unpleasant publicity of an embezzlement naturally will affect their confidence in your institution . How much confidence can you afford to lose this year , Mr. Smith ? &nbsp; SMITH ( losing control of himself ) Day , you 're an unmitigated scoundrel ! &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( charmingly ) Thank you , sir . I find it much nicer than being an ordinary one .

DAYAn agreement not to prosecute Barton . &nbsp; SMITHAnd if I refuse to sign it ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYBarton stands trial and you gain nothing but a black eye for your firm . Smith glares for a second at the calm face of Day . Abruptly he signs the paper and tosses it to Day . &nbsp; SMITHDay , you are positively the most unmitigated scoundrel in the world ! &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( bowing ) Thank you . It 's flattering to know I am progressing so quickly in your esteem . ( Smith angrily reaches for the brief case in which to put the money , but Day tosses him a large envelope ) If you will . ( Smith stuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go ) And now may I know the whereabouts of my  --  my former cashier ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYCertainly. ( he comes from behind desk ) He 's here . I almost forgot to give you the pleasure of meeting him . Day takes the key off the desk and unlocks the library door . He jerks his head in command and Barton emerges fearfully . Smith flies up in a rage at the sight of him . &nbsp; SMITHYou thief ! You  --  you contemptible traitor ! To think I trusted you for ten years ! Loved you like a son  --  &nbsp; MR . BARTON ( pathetically ) You underpaid me  --  you  --  &nbsp; SMITHDo n't talk to me ! You 've lost the right to speak to honest men !  --  32  --  &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYDo n't worry , Barton  --  you can speak to us . &nbsp; MR . BARTONI 'm sorry , Mr. Smith . &nbsp; SMITHSorry ! You steal ninety thousand dollars and you 're sorry ! &nbsp; MR . BARTONBut I 've tried to make restitution  --  &nbsp; SMITHRestitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored forty thousand ! &nbsp; SMITH ( pointing to Day ) He said thirty thousand ! &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYNaturally there was the attorney 's fee . &nbsp; SMITH ( wildly ) You took ten thousand dollars for your part in this criminal affair ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYI took ten thousand dollars for my advice as a lawyer . Smith snorts and strides over to the door . Opening it , he turns for a second and glares at Barton and Day . &nbsp; SMITHA worthy pair ! A thief and a blackleg lawyer ! &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY ( smiles ) Maybe I can be of service to you some day , Mr. Smith . Smith exits and slams the door . Day crosses to his desk and rings for Hickey . Barton steps over eagerly .  --  33  --  &nbsp; MR . BARTONThen it 's all settled ? ( Day nods contemptuously ) They wo n't prosecute me ? ( Day shakes his head ) You 're not going to keep all my ten thousand are you , Mr. Day ? &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYYours ? You stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MR . BARTON ( to Day  --  whiningly ) But it 's all I 've got ! You would n't take everything I have , would you ? I ca n't get work now  --  What can I do ? &nbsp; VINCENT R.

DAY ( disgustingly pushing him through the door ) Get out ! Day slams the door shut and shrugs . He crosses to the desk as Hickey steps forward . &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAYIf there 's one thing I loathe  --  it 's a welcher. ( he tosses the two packages of bills over to Hickey and starts getting into his overcoat . ) Put that in the safe , sweetheart . The rest of that crowd out there will have to wait . If anything important comes up  --  phone me at J.B. 's . &nbsp; MISS HICKEY ( fingering the bills ) Well !

The prosecution charges that the defendant  --  The CAMERA PANS to Tony and then back to Day . &nbsp; VINCENT R. DAY --  committed murder by administering poison . The prosecution has tried to show you that the deceased was a business rival of the defendant . My good friend , The District Attorney , tried to introduce evidence that the defendant was engaged in unlawful enterprise . That was done to prejudice your minds , and the court very justly ruled that all such evidence be stricken out .

I have nothing to add . It now becomes your duty to weigh the facts carefully and arrive , at a just verdict .

When you have reached an agreement you will notify me in the usual manner and I will be present to hear your verdict . Gentlemen , you may retire .
