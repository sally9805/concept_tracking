" It shall be unlawful for any person employed in any administrative or supervisory capacity by any agency of the Federal Government , whose compensation , or any part thereof , is paid from funds authorized or appropriated by any Act of Congress , to use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or of affecting the results thereof . " <P> So reads the dynamite clause of " An Act to prevent pernicious political activities " drafted by New Mexico 's Kansas-born , judicially-minded Democratic Senator Carl Atwood Hatch . He has been hammering at **32;12050;TOOLONG ever since 1932 . In 1935 , he joined Oregon 's late Republican Senator Steiwer in proposing such an act to disinfect the next year 's national election , but the Senate beat them down . He tried again in 1938 , but Kentucky 's Alben Barkley , in mortal danger of defeat for renomination by Governor " Happy " Chandler 's State-employe machine , staved the bill off by an impassioned plea . But the Senate passed his bill unanimously two months ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way by assuring newsmen it would become law before the Congress rises this summer . But his hard-bitten old friend , Chairman Hatton Sumners of the House Judiciary Committee ( where the bill went ) was sick . Half-incubated , not even warm , the bill lay neglected until a subcommittee , headed by Massachusetts ' iron-grey Arthur Healey , reported it favorably to the full committee , amended only to except from its prohibitions the President , Vice President , Cabinet and assistants ( one each ) , Congress ( and staffs ) . <P> <P> Telephones on Capitol Hill then began to jangle . At the business end of the phones was watchful old Charles Michelson , $25,000-a-year mouthpiece of the Democratic National Committee . Senator Hatch had talked about his bill with Franklin Roosevelt , understood him to be in favor . But Representative Healey and New York 's Emanuel Celler ( in Hatton Sumner 's absence , acting chairman of the full Judiciary Committee ) visited the White House and came away saying that the bill , as written , was fine in principle but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , remove its " monstrosities and absurdities . " At his press conference Mr. Roosevelt said it was " badly drawn " ( which was remarkable , since Carl Hatch 's language echoed almost word for word Rule No. 1 of the Civil Service code ) . Carl Hatch feared that Mr. Roosevelt 's men had orders to rewrite his act so as to immunize the very hyenas he had been trying to exterminate from politics : U. S. district attorneys , independent agency officials ( WPA , FCC , FTC , and the like ) , internal revenue and customs collectors , etc. etc. * <P> <P> * Postmasters , arch political agents since Andrew Jackson 's day , were " removed " from politics by covering them into the Civil Service last year .
