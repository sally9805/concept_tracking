( See front cover ) <P> For meteorological and commercial reasons , when summer ends , the radio season begins . Some broadcast sponsors think programs may be spoiled by summer static ; others believe listeners are cool when the weather is warm . By last week , however , practically every solvent producer of consumer goods in the U. S. , cheered by signs of recovery ( see col. i ) , had laid his plans to tap the national pocketbook by tickling the national ear with the mightiest and most expensive free show since radio began . <P> This year advertisers will pay nearly $100,000,000 to the eight U. S. networks , * 561 stations , for time rental alone . Of this the stations will plow back less than $10,000,000 on sustaining ( noncommercial ) programs . It will take another $51,000,000 to pay the vaudeville , theatrical and cinema talent which this year will pump commercial entertainment through the 26,000,000 loudspeakers of the land . This opulent wedding of Big Business and Show Business will thus beget a lively brood of ck , vns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who serve as U. S. Industry 's most spectacular sales crew . It had taken a summer of wangling and finegling between talent agents , time salesmen , admen and sponsors to line up the 1936-37 radio'season , which by last week manifested the following high spots : <P> Procter &; Gamble was to continue to rent the largest amount of air time . With 13 hr. 15 min. a week on National Broadcasting networks , P. &; G. will spend some $3,000.000 this year on seven different programs to plug Oxydol , Ivory Soap , Camay , Chipso , Crisco . Because it now uses day time exclusively , Radio 's No. i customer is not likely to be inconvenienced this autumn , as will many another advertiser , by the many and unavoidable interruptions caused by the political oratory of a Presidential campaign . As in the past , most of P. &; G. 's programs will be serial dramas designed , like the fiction in women 's magazines , for housewifely appeal . For these programs , talent cost is relatively low . <P> American Tobacco , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's books , also carries a relatively small talent budget . Though Lucky Strike 's weekly Your Hit Parade is played by routine bandsmen , it offers this season a unique merchandising trick characteristic of American Tobacco 's rampant , sensation-loving President George Washington Hill . The program purports to present the week 's 15 most popular songs . Mr. Hill promises to give a carton of his cigarets to every listener who correctly predicts , in order of popularity , the first three songs . By last month , the " Lucky Strike Sweepstakes " had used 150 tons of application blanks . Biggest week drew 6.500,000 replies . Biggest weekly give-away was 43,000,000 cigarets which set American Tobacco back about $200.000 . To facilitate his flood of free smokes , Mr. Hill is using every station of N. B. C. 's combined Red &; Blue networks , at a weekly cost of $22,000 for a full hour on Wednesday nights , repeats the show three evenings later for another $18,395 over the entire Columbia chain .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
