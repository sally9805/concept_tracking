One of the most stubborn of California 's public health problems is the high incidence of coccidioidomycosis ( " valley fever , " " desert fever " ) among farmhands , sheepherders and oil workers of the San Joaquin Valley . Although coccidioidomycosis was first recognized in 1893 , it was not until last June that a complete picture of the course of the disease was presented to physicians . Last week , at the San Francisco meeting of the Society of American Bacteriologists , Dr. Ernest Charles Dickson of Stanford Medical School , pioneer worker in valley fever , gave the first public , comprehensive account of the disease he had studied for 20 years . <P> Cause of the disease is the reproductive spores of the coccidioides fungus . which are found in grape , hay and cotton dust-primarily in the San Joaquin Valley . When the spores are inhaled they settle in the lungs , cause symptoms similar to those of flu , common cold or bronchopneumonia . In a few days the " cold " clears up , but a week or two later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms , scalp . Known to valley workers as " the bumps , " this erythemanodosum lasts anywhere from a few days to several weeks . When it finally fades , leaving only brown spots , the first stage of the disease is complete . There is no specific treatment for the erythema , but even without a physician 's care practically all the victims recover . <P> More rare and more deadly is the second stage , known to physicians as coccidioidal granuloma . Any time after an attack of " valley fever , " about one patient in 500 develops symptoms of tuberculosis : enlargement of lymph nodes , lesions of the bones . Large ulcers develop all over the body and after extended suffering , 50% of the patients die . Medicine can offer them no help , for doctors know little of the course of the disease . <P> Only procedure is to treat coccidioidal granuloma like tuberculosis . By 1936 , said short , bright-eyed Dr. Dickson , 450 cases of the secondary disease had been reported in San Joaquin Valley , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disease is not contagious and attacks animals as well as men . Why San Joaquin Valley is the centre of coccidioidomycosis , Dr. Dickson could not say . Perhaps the hot dry summers , he suggested , favor the growth and reproduction of the fungus . Certain it is that the disease is not spreading beyond the valley .
