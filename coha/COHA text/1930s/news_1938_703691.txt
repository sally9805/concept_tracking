txt Situated in this tight little 20-mile stretch of Susquehanna valley are the Triple Cities of Binghamton . Johnson City and Endicott , a fourth smaller town , Owego , and several suburban communities . In and around these cities are located more than 25 shoe factories , tanneries , chemical plants and rubber mills employing 20.000 of the communities ' 150,000 population . Together these plants represent the world 's greatest concenThis is the first of two articles on efforts of the American Federation of Labor 's soot and Shoe Workers union to organize the 20,000 employes of Endicott ** Corp. , the second largest shoe manufacturer in the country . when he was 42 , bought a half interest with his personal note for 5150.000 and $150 borrowed from Mr. Endicott to pay the war stamp tax . Expanded Rapidly Thereafter , the company expanded rapidly , entering the tanning business in order to save the tanner 's profits , broadening its line from leather work shoes to include men 's shoes for everyday business wear , girls ' and women 's shoes , dress shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes , baby shoes , even patent leather burial shoes . Here came George F. Johnson 57 years ago to take a job as foreman of the treeing room in the one small Binghamton factory of the Lester brothers  --  the company which later became the Endicott-Johnson Corp . Only 25 years old , he already had 12 years ' experience in Massachusetts shoe factories . In the aggregate these policies make what he terms an " industrial democracy . " They express his philosophy in such terms as a " ' square deal , " the " golden rule " and " personal contact " He spent millions of dollars building homes for his people . providing them with hospitals and clinics , playgrounds with free merry-gorounds , golf courses , athletic fields , ball parks . community houses , libraries , swimming pools . public markets where farmers from 50 miles around could bring produce to sell at low prices to E. .1 . workers . Profit-Sharing Plan No formal pension or insurance plans have been established , but the company does provide aid for retired employes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 , 1919. when the old partnership was dissolved and the present corporation formed . Under this plan profits are divided equally between workers and company after payment of preferred dividends and payment of dividends , or setting aside . $5 or 10% a common share . Distribution to employes is share and share alike , with equal amounts going to every one with the company two years or more . Payments were made each year until 1928. but none has been made since . Although the company made money throughout the depression , earnings did not reach $5 a share on the common . Now this satiation is threatened by a campaign of the American Federation of Labor 's Boot and Shoe Workers ' union to organize and secure sole bargaining rights for E. J. employes . The campaign represents a clash between two opposing philosophies ? individual bargVning combined with an extremely broad ? elfar6 program versus collective ba *gaining through an outside union with weekly pay checks covering substantially all benefits received . On one side is George F. , at 81 still chairman and active head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations policies , and various business organizations which have been waging a bitter anti-union campaign , and , apparently , most of the community not connected with the company . Union Organizer On the other side is Ben Berk , an aggressive young organizer for the union . who has himself spent many years as a shoe worker , those E. J. workers who have joined or who are sympathetic with the union , and , as a second line of defense . the National Labor Relations Board 's regional director in Buffalo . Henry J. Winters , to whom the union carries its plaints of unfair opposition tactics and who it has asked to conduct an election among E. J. workers . The union has raised the cry of paternalism . has sought to capitalize on desire of employes to find happiness in their own way instead of having it handed to them by the company , has promised higher wages . criticized the company 's piece work wage policies , scored the lack of collective bargaining , and sought to stir up resentment in many other ways . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoe industry , and short hours and small paychecks of early 1938 months , when the company was working off inventories built up in latter part of 1937 . The company had kept its men at work then in anticipation of a business upturn which did n't materialize until 1938 was well advanced . But the real issue is the industrial relations policy of the company as opposed to the current trend of labor toward consolidation of its strength into unions for bargaining with industry on a power basis . Nir Johnson insists that he can provide more value and happiness by spending $1. - 000,000 for his employes than they could provide spending $2,000,000 individually . This point is n't argued by the union , but it does insist that the employes would rather have the money to spend themselves . Wage Comparison Good The position of the company , as stated by Mr. Johnson , is that wages are the highest of any company in the industry making similar low priced shoes , that expenditures for welfare activities have not come out of wages , but out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholders , and that wages are the highest that can be paid by the company in light of tax burdens and necessity of paying at least a minimum return on capital invested , which in this company , he says , is probably less than value of the properties . Employes in addition to their wages have a great many other advantages not found elsewhere , including hospital and medical service , the opportunity to buy homes at cost or below with interest being charged on unpaid balances at rate of only 3% , and with monthly payments averaging around $30 , which is sufficient to pay for the typical home built by the company in 12 years . Homes provided under this plan , he says , are estimated to cost about one-half those financed by other private or governmental agencies . Mr. Johnson believes the Wagner Act is unfair because of restrictions it places on employers as contrasted to freedom allowed union organizers and because of limitations on employes permitted to vote in NLRB elections . He insists that in any election every employe from sweeper to chairman should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many employes have worked for Endicott Johnson 40 years and more in peace and harm8fily . This has been due , he believes , to the confidence and loyalty which has been built up in the company by its welfare activities . Because of these activities employes have more chance of finding happiness in this valley , he believes , than anywhere else in the world . One gets the impression in talking to him that here is a fine man , sincerely and honestly trying to do what he thinks . is best for his people , but who is now sorely troubled by signs of apparent ingratitude.
