A Japanese shipping agent in Manhattan buys a cargo of rusty old rails , iron pipe , sawed-off steel girders , stoves , smashed automobiles . He loads it into a creaky freighter already headed for the junk heap . Manned by Japanese , the ship takes on enough coal for one voyage , limps south through the Panama Canal , manages to reach Nagasaki 11,000 mi. away . There the cargo is dumped into smelters . The ship proceeds to Osaka where , in the world 's largest ship-breaking yard , acetylene torches reduce its hull to hunks of scrap . The crew works back to New York for another ship , another cargo . The scrap goes into Japanese skyscrapers , bridges , turbines , locomotives , spinning wheels or , according to many a suspicious U. S. citizen , into armaments and ammunition . <P> As the world 's biggest importer of steel scrap , Japan is wholly dependent on the U. S. , which is the only large industrial nation with no scrap export embargo . Last week the Department of Commerce announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,835,554 tons against 773,000 tons the year before . Of this total export 1,168,000 tons or 63% had gone to Japan . Italy , which like Japan suffers a shortage of good iron ore , was next biggest buyer with 225,644 tons . Great Britain was third with 134,434 tons . <P> Nothing irritates U. S. scrap dealers so much as to be told that scrap shipments are creating a U. S. shortage . Scrap is abundant , they say . There are about 750,000,000 tons of steel in use in the U. S. , part of which must go into scrap every year as new steel is forged . Theoretically , the entire 1928 production of automobiles is ready for the junk heap this year . And compared with annual domestic scrap consumption of 17,000,000 tons , last year 's exports of 1,835,000 tons was only a piffling 10% . Because scrap is an international commodity , it tends to flow to countries whose steel industries are operating at capacity . Japan 's steel mills happen to be running at 100% . Hence the focus of scrap shipments to Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a darker view . William Randolph Hearst and certain members of the U. S. Senate believe that the U. S. is 1 ) depleting valuable national resources by shipping scrap , and 2 ) unwittingly helping Japan build a more powerful military machine for aggressive action . They point to the fact that Japan 's sharp increase in scrap buying ( 500% in three years ) has taken place since 1931 , when fighting began in Manchuria . Hence some members of the Senate Munitions Committee , which is currently investigating Japanese purchases in the U. S. , favor an embargo on scrap exports .
