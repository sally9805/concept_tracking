Ten years ago , when the president of a Washington , D. C. veterinary college sadly passed out diplomas to the four members of his graduating class and announced that the college , founded 35 years before , was thenceforth discontinued , it appeared that few men cared to become horse doctors ( TIME , June 27 , 1927 ) . Last week the annual convention of the American Veterinary Medical Association in Omaha demonstrated that , on the contrary , more and more men want to be horse doctors . <P> There are 10,000 practicing veterinarians in the U. S. now , more than ever before . Half of them belong to the A. V. M. A. and a quarter of them were in Omaha for the convention . There are now ten veterinary colleges in the U. S. and two in Canada , all departments of universities or State colleges . Last September 2,500 qualified applicants sought admission to those schools , but there was room for only 646 . A big reason for men wanting to doctor animals is that the 5,000,000 owners of 200,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize more &; more the dollar- &-cent; value of scientific medical advice and treatment for their flocks and herds . <P> Another source of employment for veterinarians is the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry , whose men inspect meat both on the hoof and in slaughter houses . All these inspectors are graduates of recognized veterinary colleges . Last week the Chief of the Bureau , Dr. John Robbins Mohler , who is celebrating his fortieth year in the service and who is one of the biggest employers of veterinarians on earth ( 800 ) , went to Omaha to boast that " the U. S. has become the safest country in the world in which to engage in breeding and raising domestic animals . " <P> Small Animals . As prosperous as any of the 2,500 veterinarians at the convention were those who specialize in " small animals " ( dogs , cats ) . The U. S. has some 2,000 of these specialists , among them two or three dozen women . Their best clients are the nation 's 40,000 professional dog breeders and the owners of pets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterinarians are up on many of the latest medical wrinkles . At Omaha last week one specialist showed how to deliver a city-bred bitch by Cesarean section , another adroitly gave a blood transfusion to a dog suffering from shock . <P> Cats . The specialist who presented a survey of " some conditions encountered in cat practice , " was Dr. F. F. Parker of Des Moines . " Twenty years ago , possibly because of my life-long affection for dogs , " he admitted , " I would hardly have believed that I would sometime present the subject of cat diseases before a group of veterinarians . However , constant association with any species of animal removes many dislikes . " Some of the things constant association had taught Dr. Parker : " Very few cats bite or scratch except through fear " ; a cat " can throw it vomit farther and harder than any other species of domestic animal " ; epilepsy is rather common in kittens ; castration of male kittens " should be done at about six months of age , spaying before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutered toms ; cats " rarely , if ever , have rickets , rheumatism , chorea , tetanus , or become poisoned by snake bites " ; morphine crazes a cat .
