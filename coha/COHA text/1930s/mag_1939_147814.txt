When quaint Dexter Merriam Keezer became president of little Reed College ( Portland , Ore. ) five years ago , he ventured a purely academic joke : that Reed might hire a good football team and special professors to keep the players eligible . Early next morning players , coaches and professors began to arrive in droves to offer their services . Dazed President Keezer sent them away , decided not to trifle again with so serious a subject . Last week football came back to plague Mr. Keezer again . <P> A big problem at Reed , a progressive college that goes in heavily for the arts and social studies , is to get enough football players for a team . Reed has a normal annual football budget of about $100 , charges nothing for admission to games . This fall , having decided that Reed football was becoming too dangerous , Mr. Keezer blew in $300 for shoulder pads , pants , etc . For the fun of it , two young facultymen-Biology Teacher William ( " Bill " ) McElroy , lately a varsity end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubbard , onetime Carnegie Fellow at Princeton-offered to coach . Result was an unusually big turnout for the team : 30 ( including two Japanese ) of Reed 's 546 students . Except on rainy days ( when less than a full team showed up ) , they practiced about an hour and a half a day . Because of lack of time , Coaches McElroy &; Hub-bard showed their pupils how to score a touchdown but not how to kick a goal afterwards . Reed 's team proceeded to whip Multnomah College ( a Y. M. C. A. school ) and Pacific College of Newberg , Ore . ( a Quaker school once attended by Herbert Hoover ) , each by the margin of a point after touchdown ( knowing nothing better to do , they passed ) . Then they licked a CCC team at Camp Goldendale . Wash . Last fortnight , having topped off their five-game season with a six-touchdown victory , they became , to the consternation of President Keezer and every self-respecting alumnus , one of the few unbeaten , untied college football teams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team from all college laboratories and libraries for five days ( one day for each victory ) . President &; faculty also began to talk darkly of redeeming Reed 's scholastic reputation by paying football players not to come to Reed . In his annual report to the trustees , President Keezer grumped : " I would be happier if football were abandoned entirely . " Last straw was an attempt to arrange a " Brain Bowl " game between Reed and oft-trounced University of Chicago . President Keezer put a stop to that .
