txt The revenue measure which will be introduced in the House of Representatives today is designed to add $1,096,000,000 to the income of the Federal Government during the fiscal year which begins next July . This is far short of the amount required to balance a budget which now faces a prospective deficit of $1.738,000,000 . But if the new bill is adopted , if the revenue derived from it comes up to expectations , if no new appropriations are authorized by Congress for the next fiscal year and if , on the contrary , a reduction of $125,000,000 can be made in the present estimates , the proposed measure will balance the budget except for the sum allotted to the sinking fund for reduction of the national debt . In that case there will be no need after June 30 to pursue what Secretary Nofrr.ta has rightly described as " the cowardly policy of borrowing . " The Government will square its receipts with its current expenditures and reaffirm the integrity of Federal credit . As has been foreseen for some time , the central proposal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent on the sales price of all manufactured articles , except for a comparatively short list of necessities . The Treasury will be author-1 ized to establish an administrative system similar to that in Canada , ' where this method of raising revenue is successfully employed . By means of a licensing system applicable to all manufacturers doing ani annual business of $20,000 or more , 1 " pyramiding " of the tax will be avoided . That the levy of 2y , per cent will be passed on to the consumer in many cases , and that it will add to this extent to the cost of living of people with small incomes , must be frankly admitted . But large incomes do not escape unscathed . In this same measure Congress proposes to double existing surtax rates on incomes above $100,000 and to add approximately one-third to normal income taxes all along the line . The proposed tax , on manufactures has one outstanding merit . It is. the only tax suggested at the hearings of the Ways and Means Committee which comes within measurable distance of raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated thatl the Government will receive $595 , - 000,000 , or slightly more than half of the total to be raised by the new bill . The balance will come from increased income taxes applicable to earnings in the calendar year 1932 ; a new gift tax ; doubling of the present levy on estates ; higher amusement taxes and fees for stock transfers ; a special tax on telephone , telegraph and radio messages ; a tax of 1 cent a gallon on imported gasoline and oil , and of 4 cents a gallon on lubricating oils ; and an excise tax on malt syrups , grape concentrates and " wort " - materials incidental to the manufacture of " home brew . " Imposition of this last tax is not without ' its plaintive note . Having discarded a source of revenue which yielded $483,000,000 in the last year before the Eighteenth Amendment took effect , Congress now seeks to raise one-ninth of this amount by penalizing the traffic which this amendment has engendered . On the whole , the new bill distributes its burdens even-handedly and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenue required in order to call a halt on the present policy of borrowing . It differs widely from the Treasury 's original proposal . But because it accomplishes the Treasury 's " main objective , " Secretary MILLS announces that it will have the " hearty support " of the Administration .
