txt The pressure of the depression on shipping today forced the Cunard Company to suspend building operations on its new 73,000-ton liner , the world 's largest , which was rapidly taking shape on the Clyde . Tomorrow morning the 3,000 men who have been building the gigantic hull will receive notice and he thrown out of work . The vessel , which would have been launched in three months , will now lie idle in the shipyard , a mere skeleton , until the economic blizzard has passed and the company is able to pay the ? 6,000,000 which it is estimated her construction will cost the pound is worth about $3.30 at the present rate of exchange . The Cunard directors explained their decision in a statement issued I tonight as an interim report to the stockholders . Their report glosses nothing over , foreshadowing a heavy adverse net balance for the coming year and asserting that plans to re/ capture the blue ribbon of the Atlantic must he postponed " as a proper precaution . " Although the Cunard Line was known to he struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only /in the shipbuilding area of the Clyde but in dozens of manufacturing towns which were supplying the materials and the machinery for the huge liner . Seventy per cent of the Clydeside shipyard workers are already out of employment , and the cessation ' of work at John Brown 's shipyard will mean a blight of unemployment over the entire area . The iron and steel works at Darlington , the marine engineering factories in Birmingham , the electrical works near Rugby and dozens of other big industries felt the company 's decision as a severe blow . The nation-wide dismay was reflected tonight in Parliament , where the Clydeside members , led by James Maxton , Left Wing Laborite , were expected to ask the government to help the Cunard Company financially so that work should not be interrupted . An immediate outcry was raised outside Parliament for the government to step in and save British prestige .

Runciman to Reply . Walter Runciman , president of the Board of Trade , will reply tomorrow to requests from all quarters of the House of Commons that the work be continued . The tie-up has arisen in part over the question of dear money , and it is said that one of the suggestions the Cunard Company put to the government . as an alternative to a direct loan is that it should bring pressure nancing to stop the Cunard from having to pay 6% per cent for discounting hills , compared with the 3% per cent anticipated when the work on the liner was commenced . Already 11,000,000 has been expended . The company 's decision will have the effect of postponing the British attempt to regain the speed supremacy of the Atlantic from Germany . Originally the plan was to i build two gigantic vessels which for / size , speed and luxury would be the last word on the Atlantic . Now , however , the field lies open for the Germans , French and Italians , and for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berengaria , Aquitania. and : Mauretania , the last named of which has already seen twenty-five years of service . Tonight 's directors ' statement Is a sequel to the annual report last March , which revealed net profits of only $90,000 as compared with almost $4,000,000 in 1929 . At that time Sir Percy Bates , the chairman of the Cunard board , announced that the new liner would be paid for with the help of the earn , ings normally set aside for depreciation of the fleet . This year , however , the sources of revenue have all but dried up and the directors admit the fact . The Directors ' Statement , " The current estimate fo. this year 's result in. the profit and loss account is a comparatively small cash surplus after providing for full debenture interest and the half-year 's preference dividend in July , but before providing for depreciation , " the directors announce . " The depreciation on ships chargeable for this year under the customary Cunard practice is 1675,000 . It is now clear that when depreciation is brought in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for the year . Consequently there will not be a net profit out of which to pay the second half-year 's dividend on the preference shares or the dividend on the ordinary shares . " The gross revenue for . 1931 is expected to be about 12,420,000 less than that of 1930 . In partial compensation for this very large reduction in revenue , the economies and Iretrenchments effected are expected to be no less than 11,780,000 . The cash balance in banks at the end of the year is expected to he 11.100,000 . The directors then explain why they have been compelled to suspend the company 's policy to replace the Aquitania . Berengaria and Mauretania with two huge vessels . Stress World Conditions . " World conditions have now arisen which , in the opinion of the directors , render some postponement of this plan advisable as a proper precaution , " the statement says . " To enable the company with financial responsibility to build ships it must at least earn the depreciation on the old ships . This the company has not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The decline in passenger and freight traffic seems to have no limit and the North Atlantic trade outlook fo , r 1932 is grave . " The international crisis has changed the whole financial background and has made the continued use of this type of finance less easy than formerly . " Having regard to these considerations the directors have reluctantly decided that it is necessary to suspend the construction of . the new liner pending some change in prospects . " At the end of the report the directors contend that the Cunard is almost alone among the great Atlantic , shipping companies in being dependent on private finance and Its own credit without direct or ftP , direct State assistave . " The directors are bending all their efforts to preserve the company 's old-established sound financial policy and to husband its resources so that if conditions return to normal the company may be in a position to benefit from the revival , " the report assures the stockholders .
