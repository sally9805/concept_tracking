Last week the Prophet , Seer &; Revelator of the world 's 746,384 Mormons observed his 80th birthday . Hale &; happy for such tributes as having a whole issue of the Mormon Improvement Era devoted to his life and works , President Heber Jedediah Grant of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints arrived in Chicago on Mormon business bent . The 2,000 Mormons who live in and around Chicago and Wisconsin were also happy . Heretofore shepherded by Mormon missionaries , they became full-fledged members of the Church last Sunday when President Grant organized their territory into Mormonism 's 118th " Stake " or bishopric . It was the second such district set up east of the Mississippi River , New York having become the first Stake two years ago ( TIME , Dec. 17 , 1934 ) <P> One reason that Mormonism appeals to a man in search of a religion is that its priesthood is vast , every male communicant in good standing belonging to its higher or lower division depending upon whether he is 21 or younger . There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week into four wards , three in the city , one in Milwaukee , each directed by an elected bishop and two counselors . Elected Stake President was President William A. Matheson of Rollaway Bed Corp . Chicago Mormons are eligible for office in the Mormon agencies which cement the Church 's life : Sunday schools , relief societies , mutual improvement associations for young people , a primary association for moppets , a genealogical society . Important to the Church is the last , through which good Mormons may seek data on their ancestors . By Mormon tenet , one 's unshriven forebears may be admitted to Mormonism retroactively and posthumously , baptized by proxy .
