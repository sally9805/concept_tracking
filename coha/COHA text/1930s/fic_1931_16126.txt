FADE IN : 1 . RUSSIAN VILLAGE NIGHT MEDIUM LONG SHOT . An open space just outside the village . The light comes from an old fashioned oil street lamp in the foreground , and the dimness is increased by a drizzling rain . The lamp is at a corner of two roads , and beside it is a rickety fence upon which there are two or three posters in Russian . Beyond the fence we see a portion of the ragged tent which houses the marionette show , and parked just beyond it a glimpse of a couple of wagons which carry the show and company . There is a dim light seen through the canvas of the tent . In the distance a suggestion of the roofs and spires of a small village . LAP DISSOLVE TO :  --  2  --  Section Details 2 . BACK STAGE Close up of an ancient gramophone playing the Russian Dance from Tschaikowsky 's Nut Cracker Suite . Pan over to the inside wall of tent where we see in grotesque distortion , the shadow of Tsarak ov and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow seen in the dim light of an oil lamp in the back stage compartment . Pan over to the wings of the little stage and shooting through them we see the marionette dolls dancing on the stage in time to the music in front of a futuristic drop . The stage and all its fittings are shabby and worn as befits a small traveling tent show . The camera pans up  --  3  --  to the top of the drop and we see Tsarakov leaning over the top and operating the strings of the marionettes . Tsarakov is a Russian about 35 , with the eyes of a dreamer  --  and artist  --  behind which is an indication of great force and will-power . His present attitude is that of listening as he gazes down with a questioning air . ( This part to be played by JOHN BARRYMORE ) &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Sardonically ) The applause is deafening . Section Details 3 . BACK STAGE FULL SHOT A little partitioned enclosure behind the stage . The walls are worn and patched canvas . Behind the drop , several barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across them , forming a bridge from which Tsarakov and Karimsky , his assistant , work the dolls . Other dolls hanging conveniently along the bridge . The back of the compartment opens through into one of the wagons . Karimsky has a couple of dolls in his hand ready to hand to Tsarakov when he needs them . Karimsky is a Russian about 30 . His face is devoid of expression . He suggests a person whose mind works about two minutes behind the situation . He takes everything as a matter of course and apparently has no sense of humor or particular feeling for anything going on around him . Whenever he speaks it is in a dead absent-minded fashion . ( This part to be played by Charles Butterworth ) &nbsp; KARIMSKYApplause ? ( Gets to his feet listening blankly ) I do n't hear any . Lately I 've been having trouble with my ears . I took some pills for it - but somehow they did n't work . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( He never looks at Karimsky when he speaks but treats him always with utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With a commanding motion of his head ) Take a look out front - no doubt the whole village is there .  --  4  --  Karimsky bends down to look into the auditorium of the tent . Section Details 4 . INTERIOR MARIONETTE TENT Shot from Karimsky 's angle . The far end of the tent is open and beyond we get a view of rain and the suggestion of a grove . Seats have been made for the audience by placing planks on kegs and boxes . The ground underneath them is soft mud and pools of water . One or two people of the peasant type are just leaving the tent , but peeping through a rip in the canvas near the entrance , is the face of a small boy , intent and rapt as he watches the dolls . &nbsp; KARIMSKYThose pills are n't so bad after all . There is n't anyone  --  but a boy peeking through the tent . &nbsp; TSARAKOVYou see what the public thinks of art . I 'd probably make much more money if I split open your head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hand ) I think it 's raining - maybe that 's why there 's no crowd . &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat would my vanity do without your brilliant alibis . Sometimes I think you 're worth the food you eat . &nbsp; KARIMSKYShall I snuff the footlights ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVNo - we must not disappoint our public . Tsarakov starts to operate the dolls again , looks down and with a sudden exclamation of disgust he pulls up one of the dolls . One of its legs has broken off . Tsarakov walks over to the other end of the bridge to take the doll out of the regular exit , and we see for the first time he walks with a limp . He has a short leg which has been compensated by a heavy soled and heeled shoe which gives him a slightly deformed appearance when he walks . He brings the doll up on the bridge , then leans over the top of the drop , makes an  --  5  --  exaggerated bow to the boy who is the sole audience . &nbsp; TSARAKOVPlease bear with us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be so kind as to find closer seats as the next act is of a more intimate nature . 5 . THE BOY 'S EYE DISAPPEARS from the hole and he wriggles in under the tent and eager , but wary , takes a seat on the last row , first looking to make sure where the exit is . &nbsp; TSARAKOVLet 's get to work . Turn on the gramophone . Curtain . Section Details 6 . CURTAIN RISES ON SECOND ACT Fedor watches with shining eyes and responsive body . Tsarakov working puppets . He picks up defective one with a disgusted look . &nbsp; TSARAKOVWood ! He breaks it in sudden fury . Fedor yells in pain offscene . Tsarakov hears it . &nbsp; TSARAKOVTurn off the gramophone . He goes to auditorium entrance and peeps through . 7 . THE PEASANTIS HOLDING THE BOY AND LASHING HIM &nbsp; FEDORDo n't hit me ! It hurts . 8 .

He 's been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , but after all , I did n't ask him , so I ca n't say - or can I ? 9 . THE PEASANT IS HOLDING THE BOY AND LASHING HIM &nbsp; PEASANTRun away will you ? Not when I get through with you ! You imp ! The boy breaks away and hurdles the benches , the peasant after him . He leaps again and then out through a slit in the wall with the peasant after him . &nbsp; PEASANTJust let me catch you ! I 'll break every bone in your body ! You devil ! 10 . TSARAKOV TURNS TO KARIMSKY &nbsp; TSARAKOVIf he is , the devil must be a mountain goat . &nbsp; KARIMSKYHe runs just like one , does n't he ? Or at least , I imagine he does . I 've never met a mountain goat personally . &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat legs he has for dancing ! 11 .

The peasant enters from the corner . &nbsp; TSARAKOVGood evening . &nbsp; PEASANTWhere 'd that boy go ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat boy ? &nbsp; PEASANTHe just ran in there . You must have seen him . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Blocks peasant ) I 'm sorry . Karimsky ! &nbsp; KARIMSKY ( As he comes out almost immediately ) Yes , sir . &nbsp; TSARAKOVHave you seen a strange boy around any place ? &nbsp; KARIMSKYNo , sir - not tonight , that is  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Interrupting - to the peasant ) You see - you must be mistaken . &nbsp; PEASANTHe 's in there , I tell you ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVAll right - look for yourself , and when you do n't find him , remember I told you he was n't here . He steps aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( In undertone ) Is he safely hidden ? &nbsp; KARIMSKYI 'll be lucky if I can find him again myself .  --  8  --  He barely finishes , when the peasant comes out again , and roars at Tsarakov in a disappointed rage : &nbsp; PEASANTHe must be some place ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( with a shrug ) Undoubtedly . There are so many places , my friend . &nbsp; PEASANT ( shaking the whip at Tsarakov ) I 'll have the police on you !  - -   - -   keeping our young ones away from their work with your jumping dolls ! The peasant turns sharply and walks away , calling out into the darkness around him : &nbsp; PEASANTFedor ! Come here or I 'll hide you when I catch you ! &nbsp; KARIMSKYWhat the devil are we going to do with the boy ? 13 . TSARAKOV RAISES THE PUPPETS he is holding in his hand and looks at them .

Oh , do n't beat me . Tsarakov sits by the bed and runs his hand over Fedor 's forehead . Fedor wakes startled , recognizes Tsarakov and relaxes with a big , blissful sigh . &nbsp; TSARAKOVDoes it still hurt ? &nbsp; FEDORNot now . You 're not going to send me home ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVNo , my boy . You 're a member of Tsarakov 's ballet now . &nbsp; FEDORA dancer ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat will your parents do when you do n't come back ? &nbsp; FEDORThey 're not my parents .

The boy turns his face into the pillow sobbing softly ,  --  11  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( to Karimsky ) Not a bad name for a dancer . &nbsp; KARIMSKYA dancer ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVThat is what I said . Nature fashioned him for that - his thighs like steel yet plastic . That is the body I should have had with my soul - a dancer 's soul --  the heritage of my mother . You never saw her dance - like a bit of thistle- down . She used to say to me , " Ivan , you have more than I. You have the genius . " ( Laughs ) Genius . It was a curse to me . It came as a nightmare to twist my dreams into hours of agony . Genius  --  with this wretched , twisted body .

Frankenstein created by man , Homoculus , the product of Science , They were dreams brought to life by mortals and if they can  --  ( Breaks off ) I will create my Golem , my Frankenstein . That boy there will be my counterpart , the thing I should have been . I will mold him  --  pour into him my genius , my soul . In him I will see my dreams , my ambitions fulfilled . I will make him the greatest dancer of all time .  --  12  --  &nbsp; KARIMSKYFoolish ! Fantastic ! A dancer with that face , those ugly scars ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVEven the face of a marionette reflects the mind of the creator who carves it .

Fedor , now about 20 , is whirling through an intricate ballet figure in front of them - while the director , Serge Bankieff , stands down right where an emaciated looking pianist is beating an old upright piano beside him . Serge gesticulates wildly to the pianist with one hand , and the dancer with the other . Serge is wild of hair and eye , violently temperamental . He works under the influence of narcotics , all action and temperament one moment , and as soon as the mood wears off , dopey and sleepy --  -- - ( This part to be played by Louis Alberni ) Section Details 21 . THE STAGE BOX OF A THEATRE CLOSE UP OF TSARAKOV 'S hands , as he drums his fingers upon the box railing , keeping time to the sound of a tinny piano which is playing ballet music off scene . THE CAMERA MOVES BACK TO : a view of TSARAKOV , sitting alone in the box . It is now ten years later in the city of Berlin , and Tsarakov is smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , however , is the only apparent change in him . He watches off toward the stage critically . 22 . ENTRANCE HALL TO THE BOX Approaching along it , is Karimsky , but little changed from when we last saw him . Following him is a jaunty , perfectly dressed , wealthy man of the world , Count Renaud . ( This part to be played by Andre Luget ) He  --  14  --  stops as Karimsky knocks on the box door and opens it , calling in : &nbsp; KARIMSKYCount Renaud to see you , Sir . Without waiting for an answer , nor seeming to expect any , he stands aside and holds the door open silently . Renaud passes him to enter with a nod of thanks . 23 . INTERIOR BOX Renaud enters . Tsarakov still sits motionless in the front row of chairs , oblivious to everything but the stage off scene . Karimsky , who has been peeking in through the doorway , closes the door and exits , as Renaud stops behind Tsarakov and speaks to him : &nbsp; RENAUDI hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns with a smile of greeting and speaks as though he had been aware of Renaud 's entrance , although he did not show it . &nbsp; TSARAKOVMy dear friend  --  you are much too rich to ever disturb anyone . Sit down , wo n't you ? &nbsp; RENAUD ( pulls back a chair and seats himself ) That permier dancer of yours hardly shares your opinion , I 'm afraid . ( continuing as he adjusts his glass to his eye , and peers toward the stage ) Every time I come near the theatre lately , he watches me like a cat . &nbsp; TSARAKOVYou mean Fedor ? &nbsp; RENAUD ( with a nod ) Look at him now  --  he 's stopped dancing . &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhy should n't he ? It 's the end of his number .  --  15  --  24 . STAGE CLOSE SHOT ON FEDOR , finishes his dance , skips off toward the wings . 25 . INTERIOR BOX CLOSE SHOT ON TSARAKOV AND RENAUD &nbsp; RENAUD ( as the piano stops and Tsarakov applauds enthusiastically ) That was not the case last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . &nbsp; TSARAKOVJust nerves . You do n't understand the artistic temperament , my friend . ( continuing , as he stops applauding ) Only an artist could dance that number at all . &nbsp; RENAUD ( rising , as Tsarakov gets up ) I agree with you - he 's very fine . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( with fanatical enthusiasm ) If you had seen him ten years ago , you would say he was a miracle . A disjointed little bag of bones . A homely little devil  --  a small frog with wings in his heels . &nbsp; RENAUDReally ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVNothing to recommend him but the mad ambition to dance ! I made that magnificent specimen you see there on the stage - just as surely as God made this world ! &nbsp; RENAUD ( smiling ) You rather fancy yourself in the role of creator , do n't you , Tsarakov ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVOne perfect artist , that is all I ask , Renaud . &nbsp; RENAUDPerfection is a lot to ask of anyone .  --  16  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVI think he 's got it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood of my brain .

To create I must be inspired -  --  to transmute this , my ballet master must go quite mad . At this moment Serge Bankieff 's voice is heard shouting from the stage off scene . The two men look toward the stage . 26 . THE STAGE Serge directing the rehearsal , raving and raging . 27 . THE BOX &nbsp; RENAUDIt seems to me he is quite mad now . Tsarakov ignores Renaud 's remark , staring angrily toward the stage . He yells to Serge that what he is doing is all wrong  --  tells him how to correct it  --  and orders him to start all over . 28 .

The latter in a bored manner points to Preskoya . &nbsp; RENAUDWhy do you keep Preskoya ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVMy contract binds me to the artist , just as it binds the artist to me . Besides , she is my library . She knows every step of every ballet in my repertoire . &nbsp; RENAUD ( Turning his back to the stage ) She is passee . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Laughing drily ) It 's true .

WE PAN THE CAMERA ALONG THE LINE OF GIRLS showing them serious now under the violence of Serge 's manner . At the end of the line we pick up Fedor and Nana Carolova standing just inside the wings . They have been chatting together and are smiling as they watch Serge . It is not a smile of derision . Nana is a bright , active , and ingenious young girl about eighteen .

( and he takes a diamond bracelet from his pocket ) It was to give you this . &nbsp; RENAUD ( taking it with a shrug ) Did n't she like it ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVNana Carolova is not used to such expensive gifts - they frighten her . Besides , it 's an atrocious design . &nbsp; RENAUDSomething more simple , maybe . &nbsp; TSARAKOVNothing could be more simple than giving diamond bracelets to Nana Carolova . &nbsp; RENAUDYou do n't know how you 've depressed me , Tsarakov . Now I shall probably eat a rotten luncheon and have indigestion. ( as he slips the bracelet into his pocket with a mock sigh ) You know , I had just about decided I could n't live without her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times .  --  20  --  &nbsp; RENAUD ( curiously - after a pause ) You have always been very generous with your dancers before . And I have been generous with them - you know yourself I do not fully appreciate their art - there is no use of me trying to fool you  --  you know the art I have always appreciated most  --  ( he laughs ) &nbsp; TSARAKOVI set no sentimental value on Nana 's virtue - nor any woman 's . To me - women are simply a necessary evil - in the ballet as well as in life . ( He looks around , adjusts his monocle , and smiles as he explains to Renaud : ) Nana is reserved especially for Fedor . He seemed to like her - so I arranged for him to have her - as I have arranged for him to have every woman he has wanted . I 'm very good at such arrangements - you know . ( He winks at Renaud ) &nbsp; RENAUD ( Smiling ) I know . &nbsp; TSARAKOVAn artist must have his relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifled by monotony . . . . he must have continual change . . . . he must be inspired by many beautiful women . &nbsp; RENAUDSuppose he falls in love with one of those beautiful women . &nbsp; TSARAKOVAs long as I feed him one woman after another - as long as he knows the pleasure of having many women - as long as he knows there will always be more for him - he will regard women as I myself regard them - merely as a commodity - for him to have as long as they please him and to throw away when he tires of them - he will never fall in love with any one of them .  --  21  --  &nbsp; RENAUDWhat is wrong with falling in love ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVFor a man like you there is nothing wrong with it . But for the artist it is fatal - he must have his heart - his whole being - in his art - and in nothing else . &nbsp; RENAUDNana seems to take up a great deal of his time . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Shrugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good for him to play . Nana amuses him - her devotion pleases him - he is happy . While he is happy I am satisfied . Do not disturb them , my friend . &nbsp; RENAUDThen I suppose I am just to burn up with desire . &nbsp; TSARAKOVThere are so many other ladies , my dear Count . &nbsp; REBAUD ( Grimly ) To the devil with the other ladies ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVExactly what I am suggesting  --  but not for Nana , my good friend . With this Tsarakov turns away with a bow , and exits toward backstage . Renaud steps forward and stands looking after him with a quizzical smile . &nbsp; pp. 22-42 34 . BACKSTAGE Tsarakov coming along toward the Green Room . He stops to look at a pretty young dancer practicing . He takes a breath-sweetening tablet out of a small box and puts it in his mouth .

Tsarakov walks on toward the stage . Section Details 35 . STAGE Pan with Tsarakov as he walks across in front of the ballet rehearsal , which is still in progress . The ensemble redoubles its efforts at his appearance , while Preskoya watches him furtively as they wait for a cue . Serge seems tired and exhausted ; he is irritable and nervous , and talks slowly , out of breath ! &nbsp; SERGE ( To the ballet ) No good . ( Then turning to Tsarakov ) The whole morning everyone has done just as they pleased !  --  23  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat 's the matter with you ? I know they 've been working like Trojans . What 's the matter with you ? Are you crazy ? He turns and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side . Before he can exit beyond them , Serge walks in slowly after him , and speaks as Tsarakov turns and confronts him : &nbsp; SERGE ( Weakly ) I can not wait for tonight !

He looks about quickly and limps toward a scenery flat in b.g. , beckoning Serge .  --  24  --  Section Details 36 . STAGE MED . LONG SHOT on an angle into the wings . The f.g . is empty but a flood of light off scene throws a light on a flat which is partly hidden by a wood wing in front of it . Tsarakov and Serge disappear behind the wing and we see their shadows behind the flat . The outlines are mere suggestions , but they show a certain movement as though Tsarakov has taken something from his pocket and Serge has grabbed it greedily . Serge rushes out , buoyed up again . Tsarakov goes on toward the Green Room , a sardonic smile on his face . We pan with him as he walks over toward the Green Room on the opposite side of the stage . Preskoya comes up to him . &nbsp; PRESKOYACan you see me for a moment ? &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Sarcastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . &nbsp; PRESKOYAHow can you treat me this way ?

Tsarakov exits to the Green Room .  --  25  --  Section Details 37 . GREEN ROOM A fairly large room which is used both as Tsarakov 's office and the reception room for visitors . A door to the street is marked exit , two other doors marked to to stage and dressing rooms , on the opposite side . Near the stage door is a desk with an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , idly inserting folded letters in envelopes . The other side of the room Fedor is waiting nervously , practicing a few dance steps as he waits . The walls are decorated with play-bills of various dates . Near the dressing room door is Tsarakov 's own desk . Tsarakov enters from the stage door . Takes a quick survey of the room , pretends not to see Fedor , limps past Karimsky toward his own desk , ignoring Karimsky . &nbsp; KARIMSKYHere is a letter from the mother of that girl in Vienna . Personally I think  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVPersonally - you ca n't think . Put it in the files with the others . Tsarakov pretends to see Fedor for the first time . Fedor starts toward him eagerly . Karimsky with feverish diligence , begins licking the flaps of the envelopes and closing them . &nbsp; TSARAKOV 38 .

Splendid . &nbsp; FEDORThat 's not what I mean . Nana has an innocence - a sweetness - &nbsp; TSARAKOVAch - she is just like all the others . &nbsp; FEDOR ( With spirit now ) She is not like all the others - she is adorable. 39 . TSARAKOV REALIZES that the boy is serious . He thinks a moment in silence .

AFTER A PAUSE , Tsarakov turns slowly toward Fedor . &nbsp; TSARAKOVIs everything all right , Fedor ? &nbsp; FEDORI would n't change places with anyone on earth .  --  27  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Amost tenderly ) Ah ! That repays me much ! Real gratitude is rare , my son . &nbsp; FEDORIt is not - just  --  gratitude . It is much more . I owe everything that I have and am  --  to you . You  --  you 've been a Father to me . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Softly ) You can be the greatest dancer in the world ! What more could anyone ask ? &nbsp; FEDORNothing . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Slyly ) Have I ever been wrong in my dealing with anything that concerns your happiness ? &nbsp; FEDORNever . &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat was the matter last night ? What caused that long pause ? &nbsp; FEDORI have just found out . It is Renaud ! When he came in the box a while ago , I had the same feeling I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew what it was . I hate the man ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhat for ? &nbsp; FEDORHe seems to think that he has only to look at any girl and she 'll  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVUnfortunately  --  they do . Any number of them have . You should know . Have n't I kept you well supplied ? &nbsp; FEDORBut not Nana Carolova ! ( As Tsarakov hides a sudden start of conviction ) Would n't you think even he could see that Nana Crolova is different !  --  28  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVYou are very sure for one so young . How often have I warned you never to place any woman too high ! It saves such a lot of dirt and fuss - when things grow stale . ( Pausing and resuming quietly ) Let 's have a drink . &nbsp; FEDORNo - thanks . &nbsp; TSARAKOVOh - it 'll do you good . 41 . TSARAKOV FIXES DRINK &nbsp; TSARAKOVI do n't wish to pry into your affairs , Fedor - but what is your relationship with Nana ? &nbsp; FEDORWe have always been friends . &nbsp; TSARAKOVThat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it becomes a bit childish when it interferes with your work . &nbsp; FEDORI admit , I 've been worried  --  about her . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Slyly ) Woll , since she is above temptation - what harm can Renaud do her ? If she is n't  --  then she 's hardly worth worrying about - is she ? &nbsp; FEDORBut she is above it ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Pretending to laugh ) In that case , Renaud will be automatically eliminated - wo n't he ? &nbsp; FEDORWhy  - -  -  ( With a grin of sudden realization ) Of course ! I believe you could clear up  --  anything ! ( Pausing and resuming in relief , as Karimsky knocks and enters ) Now - I must go back to work .  --  29  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVBy the way , after the show I 'd like to have you come out to supper with me .

Tsarakov makes a big fuss over her . &nbsp; TSARAKOVI had something very important to tell you . &nbsp; OLGAYes , maestro ? &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Leans close to her and speaks intimately ) Some one here is very interested in you . &nbsp; OLGA ( Leaning closer to Tsarakov , speaking eagerly ) Yes maestro ?

( to Karimsky ) Take off the dust cloth . ( to Renaud , as Karimsky obeys ) You know the story ? &nbsp; RENAUDVaguely . &nbsp; TSARAKOVThe climax comes when the hero sees the girl he loves sacrificed to the idol he has worshipped . With those veils you see , I try to indicate the beauty that he sees in it . Despair  --  34  --  and pain tear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And get out !

They are like two turtle-doves  --  in separate cages . &nbsp; TSARAKOVAnd I am going to keep them  --  separated !

CLOSE SHOT ON TSARAKOV He stands motionless a moment , his face gradually taking on an expression of evil and storn determination . Karimsky enters the SHOT behind Tsarakov as though having entered from the dressing room door . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( without looking at him ) Type me a form of release for Nana Carolova. ( as Karimsky nods and exits to his desk ) Two copies  --  and watch your spelling . Tsarakov stumps up and down for a second as we hear Karimsky off scene inserting paper in his typewriter . Then Serge bursts in from the stage violently . &nbsp; SERGEYou want me ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVYes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts toward a chair but stops transfixed as he sees the Idol across the room . &nbsp; SERGE ( excitedly ) What 's that ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVThat 's The Idol . You approved the sketch . &nbsp; SERGE ( going into an artistic rage ) Do you expect me to climax the show with that monstrosity !  --  Impossible ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVWhy ? &nbsp; SERGE ( tearing at his hair ) Look at it ! It 's cardboard ! Plaster ! It 's dead ! It should be alive  --  it should be wiggling  --  it should represent all the ugly people of the World rolled into one , with poisonous blood oozing from its veins ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( coolly ) Well , we 'll look around for something like that . &nbsp; SERGENo . That wo n't do  --  I 've got it ! It should be played by an actor ! It should be a human being  --  that 's what 's the matter with the ballet  --  everything is repainted  --  everything is false  --  ( continuing nervously as Karimsky works the typewriter loudly ) &nbsp; TSARAKOVKeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLOSE SHOT ON KARIMSKY AT HIS DESK He finishes typing , pulls the sheets of paper out of the machine as Tsarakov enters the scene . Tsarakov reaches out for the sheets without looking at Karimsky.  --  38  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOVGive them to me  --  and take this down . ( pauses thoughtfully as Karimsky puts in a fresh sheet of paper ) Address it to me  --  informally . ( pauses again as Karimsky types an address , then starts dictating ) Carolova has a very pretty talent  --  but her role in " The Idol " is beyond her capabilities . Her experience with life has been too limited to enable her to bring the essential sophistication to this important role . 52 . C. U. OF SERGE Sitting in a chair and staring in blank amazement at Tsarakov as he listens to the words . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( voice off scene ) That 's all . Leave it unsigned . &nbsp; KARIMSKYPoor girl  --  I hope she does n't recognize my typewriting . Karimsky takes the paper out of the typewriter and hands it to Tsarakov . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out !  --  and stay out , until I call you ! Karimsky gets up meekly and exits . As soon as he is gone Serge bursts into the scene as though he had leaped out of his chair . &nbsp; SERGEWhat was that you just dictated ? &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( coolly ) Only a note you sent me this evening . &nbsp; SERGE ( startled ) I ? You know very well I never wrote such a thing about Nana !  --  39  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Bending his gaze keenly and commandingly upon Serge ) Oh yes you did ! And I 've decided to follow your advice . ( with brutal finality ) Preskoya will dance Carolova 's role - beginning with tonight 's rehearsal . Tsarakov turns abruptly away and goes toward his desk . Serge 's eyes follow him in horror , as he takes a step after him . 53 . CLOSE SHOT AT TSARAKOV 'S DESK Tsarakov enters , lays paper on his desk and dips pen in ink-well . Serge enters behind him . &nbsp; TSARAKOVNow - sign this . &nbsp; SERGENo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Holding out the pen with his commanding gaze still on Serge ) I warned you last week that I was not quite sure of Nana Carolova in The Idol . I have lost interest in her on account of the mediocrity of her work  --  and this note from you verifies my judgement . ( Holding the pen out and pulling Serge 's gaze again to his ) Sign it . &nbsp; SERGENo - I tell you ! NO ! ! ( As he fights hysterically against the urge to yield ) You can not ask me to lie to her . I wo n't ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVNo ? Tsarakov drops pen on desk . He reaches very deliberately into his inside pocket , brings out a small leather case . Serge 's eyes light up , greedily , like  --  40  --  a starving dog who sees food held just beyond his reach . Tsarakov plays deliberately to arouse Serge 's eagerness . Then he turns slowly away and walks out in the direction of the stove . Serge stares at him tensely , finally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serge as he walks over toward Tsarakov . &nbsp; SERGE ( In alarm ) What are you going to do ? Tsarakov standing beside the stove now comes into the picture . Tsarakov is taking off the upper lid with a poker . &nbsp; TSARAKOVThat depends entirely on you . &nbsp; SERGEYou always have so much ! How can you get  --  so much ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVI could easily forget how  --  and there never would be any more at all  --  ( He is taking off the lid and leans over the open stove so that the glow gives a satanic appearance to his face ) If you should allow me to drop this into the fire . ( He holds up the package ) &nbsp; SERGE ( Desperately ) You are the devil ! The DEVIL ! ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVOr an angel , perhaps , who is giving you a chance to redeem yourself . It would be quite a magnificent gesture in its way , because if you should summon up a magnificent courage to meet it , I would be at a sad disadvantage . ( Stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I drop it , you 'll be free ! You will suffer horribly of course  --  but in the end you 'll be happier than you can ever dream .  --  41  --  &nbsp; SERGE ( Struggling with himself ) DROP IT ! Tsarakov shrugs and moves to drop the case into the fire . &nbsp; SERGENo ! NO ! ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVIf I put it back into my pocket - ( Pausing with a meaning glance toward the note on his desk )  --  you pay for it . &nbsp; SERGE ( With a desperate struggle ) Put it  --  back  --  Tsarakov slowly replaces the case in his pocket . Serge breaks completely and staggers out toward the desk . Tsarakov watches him with satanic satisfaction , replaces the lid on the stove . 54 . CLOSE SHOT AT TSARAKOV 'S DESK Serge standing beside the desk is just finishing signing the note with a trembling hand . The pen drops from his nervous fingers and he drops his face in his hands just as Tsarakov bends beside him . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( With a smile ) Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody any good . Go and tell Preskoya the news . She 'll substitute tonight for Nana . Serge 's head comes up and he glares a silent fanatical hatred at Tsarakov . Tsarakov meets his gaze coolly . Then with a motion of his head to follow , turns and walks toward the stage door . Serge follows . PAN WITH THEM as they walk toward the stage door . Their course takes them close to the stove and Serge who is just behind Tsarakov , stops , picks up the poker and glares at Tsarakov 's back with a murderous look . He is about to raise the poker when Tsarakov suddenly turns and faces him . Tsarakov looks at him steadily without flinching , a commanding hypnotic gaze . Serge hesitates , then weakens . He drops the poker to the floor with a clatter . &nbsp; SERGEYou are a devil !  --  42  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Smiling ) Necessity often makes devils of angels . Serge hesitates a moment , and then without a word , turns and exits rapidly toward the stage door . Tsarakov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and then turns toward his desk . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Calling off ) Karimsky ! Without waiting for an answer he limps on out toward his desk . 55 . CLOSEUP OF TSARAKOV 'S DESK Tsarakov enters and seats himself , picks up the note which Serge has signed . As he does so , Karimsky enters , stands meekly waiting orders . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( His eyes on the note ) Tell Carolova I want to see her  --  here . Hurry ! It 's almost time for the Overture . Karimsky nods and exits . Tsarakov reads the note , carefully folds it deliberately and puts it in his pocket . Then he leans back and drums his long slender fingers on the desk reflectively . pp. 1-21 &nbsp; pp. 43-61 56 . STOCK SHOT OF CROWD TAKING SEATS IN THEATRE. : 57 .

There is no answer , and he knocks again . Then he calls to her . &nbsp; FEDORNana ! It 's Fedor . An anxious look appears on his face . He knocks again-hesitates a moment , and then tries the door . It opens , and he looks inside . Slowly , Fedor closes the door again . His anxiety increases and he starts away to find her . Section Details 59 . GREEN ROOM Tsarakov is standing in front of the prop idol . His back is turned deliberately toward Nana as she sits in front of his desk and reads Serge 's note , which Tsarakov has given her . A look of startled amazement grows on her face as she runs through it the second time . Then she speaks in a stunned manner , rising slowly to her feet . &nbsp; NANABut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsarakov turns ) Serge has always been so nice to me . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Approaching his desk and shrugging ) You can see how he really feels . &nbsp; NANA ( With a fearful look at him ) But you 're not going to  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( As she hesitates , as though afraid to finish ) What can I do ? I hate to appear unjust  --  or cruel  --  but under the circumstances , I must ask you to give up your role . &nbsp; NANA ( stunned ) You - you mean - that after all , I  --  I have no talent ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVPerhaps with more study and work  --   --  44  --  &nbsp; NANA ( Beginning to break down ) How can I go on at all  --  after this ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVI intend to save you every possible mortification . We will simply dissolve our contract by mutual consent - and no one need ever know that you did n't leave us because of  - -  -  other plans . He seats himself and draws the two releases from his pocket . Nana watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoves them toward her along the desk . Then she gasps : &nbsp; NANABut - I do n't want to leave ! &nbsp; TSARAKOVTo stay would only force me to advertise your failure . &nbsp; NANA ( Almost hysterically ) Where will I go ? &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Suggestively ) There are other ballets . With influence behind you , it might be possible to get another chance . &nbsp; NANA ( Becoming . panic stricken at the thought ) No ! I CAN dance ! I WILL dance ! Oh please  --  I will work so hard - I will do anything  --  if only you will let me try again ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Slyly - with a suggestive smile at her ) It seems to me that your chances of success will be much greater if you place yourself - er - where only youth and beauty are necessary . &nbsp; NANA ( As she gets his meaning ) You mean  --  Renaud ?  --  45  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( With a shrug ) My dear child , I am not inhuman . I could not close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NANAYou were thinking of this when you asked me to make friends with him ! ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVI was thinking of your happiness , my dear . &nbsp; NANABut , Fedor  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( As she stops short in realization of what she has said ) Fedor is like my son  --  bound to me body and soul by what he owes me . There is no room in his life for anyone that I do not choose to put there  --  and I DO NOT CHOOSE YOU ! Or any woman ! ( pausing and resuming quickly ) Have you been so foolish as to fall in love with him ? ( Pausing again as she looks at him in silent pleading ) Answer me ! Have you ? ( Once more he pauses with his eyes fixed upon her , and she bows her head in admission , as he resumes ) Does he reciprocate your feelings ? Has he spoken to you at all  --  of love ? &nbsp; NANA ( Slowly raising her head as Tsarakov 's hypnotic gaze draws her eyes to his ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you love him at all  --  you will go away before you murder the career of a genius . &nbsp; NANA ( With emotion , as the tears flood her eyes pitifully ) But what about - me ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVI said those words once  --  and the woman I said them to  --  laughed in  --  46  --  my face ! ( Pausing bitterly and resuming ) You must laugh in Fedor 's  --  Nana stands motionless , as though dazed . Then she reaches numbly for the pen , as if she realized that she were beaten . Tsarakov speaks and holds it toward her . &nbsp; TSARAKOVHere is the pen . ( Pausing as Nana brushes the blinding tears from her eyes , and takes it ) Both papers , please . ( Pausing again while she signs them and papers ) It is  --  in my trunk . &nbsp; TSARAKOVJust destroy it .

Wait ! !  --  47  --  She slips past him to the door and he turns quickly after her . Tsarakov limps into the scene , looks out after them apprehensively. 61 .

Fedor passes him through the doorway , as Section Details 62 . GREEN ROOM Tsarakov slowly closes the door and turns toward Fedor , who has walked several steps into the room . For a moment there is silence then Tsarakov limps forward ; &nbsp; FEDORHow can I remember anything but what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not listened . It makes so much more for us to wipe out . &nbsp; FEDORHow can you wipe out love ? &nbsp; TSARAKOVWomen seem to have found a way . There is no woman alive who will not deceive and hurt the man who loves her - or even the man she loves - for a price ! &nbsp; FEDORYou may think that is true  --  but you ca n't make me believe it ! &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Almost tenderly as Fedor turns away ) Must you find it out for yourself ? ( Pausing and resuming as Fedor faces him again ) Do n't you see  --  I only want to keep you from suffering . &nbsp; VOICE OF CALL BOY ( Off stage ) Overture - one minute ! &nbsp; FEDORHow can you say that - after what I heard , behind that door ! ( Looking away from Tsarakov ) I worshipped you as some people worship an idol . You were my father and God in one . Do you think it did n't hurt - to see how cruel  --  and small  --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pausing as though unable to go on , and resuming emotionally as Tsarakov just stares at him ) You had no right to break Nana 's heart  --  and kill all her hope in her work  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Interrupting almost violently ) What was her work but a part of the setting for you ! I can find a hundred Carolova 's ! But there is only one FEDOR ! ( Advancing toward Fedor and continuing wildly ) Who made him ? ! There is a pause and both are tensely silent , as Tsarakov focuses his hypnotic gaze on Fedor 's in fierce questioning . 63 . SEMI-CLOSE SHOT OF TSARAKOV He answers his own question dramatically . Music of the Overture starts to play faintly off stage ; and continues throughout the episode . &nbsp; TSARAKOVI made you ! I re-created myself as I wanted to be  - -  -  and I am a very jealous god - who has succeeded in rising from a hell of his own , through you . ( As he limps slowly back and forth , in front of Fedor ) You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walk ! At six , I could hobble about on a little crutch ! That crutch made my mother - hate me ! She was a dancer - the premiere danseuse of the Imperial Russian Ballet . My father hated me too - although I never saw him . The child of a grand duke by a ballet dancer is a thing to be forgotten in polite circles . ( Pausing and resuming with a bitter laugh ) One day , my mother did n't come home  - -   - -   I found out years later that a German Count had taken her seriously , and honored her with a wedding ring . ( Pausing again with a look at Fedor ) So you can see why I always say , every women has her price !  --  50  --  &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Continued ) ( continuing his pacing ) But she left me a heritage - a mad desire to dance  - -  -  with an iron brace to hold me from it like a vise !

CLOSEUP OF FEDOR His eyes following Tsarakov fascinated as the latter paces up and down . &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Voice off scene ) There is n't a movement of your marvelous , dancing legs but I am behind them - telling them what to do , through your brain . I have made you - piece by piece - from the bag of skin and bones that dragged itself into my tent like a whipped cur. 65 . TWO SHOT ON TSARAKOV AND FEDOR &nbsp; TSARAKOV ( Leaning toward Fedor ) Do you remember that night ? ! How you had been beaten ? How glad you were to get away ?

Tsarakov 's calm and dominant manner and Nana 's failure to reply , give Fedor a sudden alarming suspicion . He begins to suspect what has happened . &nbsp; FEDOR ( Alarmed ) Nana !

He sees that the bedroom is empty , turns back to Tsarakov . &nbsp; FEDORWhere is she ?

She was like the rest - and her price was to be rid of fear ! FEAR - of the day when you would find out your mistake for yourself : ( His voice rising dramatically ) Is that cruelty - or not ? !

As he brings the knife down , Tsarakov gives a cry of terror which is suddenly broken off short , and then Tsarakov crumples up half on the window seat and half on the floor . Fedor steps back and with a gasp of horror looks at the knife then his hold relaxes and the knife clatters to the floor . &nbsp; FEDOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently ) TSARAKOV ! I did n't touch you !
