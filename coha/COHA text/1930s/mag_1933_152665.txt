In Argentina soccer is known as futbol . Every autumn Sunday 18 major league teams play it in stadia throughout Buenos Aires . Every Sunday Argentine fans reach a fine pitch of emotion . Last week , as Argentine 's autumn got under way , Sunday crowds saw many a fine futbol game . At one a River Plate player assaulted and broke the jaw of an opponent . He was held for trial on $5,000 bail . Another was arrested for kicking his opponent in the stomach . Exhilarated , the crowd began to throw rocks at the players . Some took out revolvers and fired furiously into the melee on the field . After one game last week futbol fans set fire to the stadium . <P> Before the games on Easter Sunday the Ministry of the Interior announced it would supervise futbol for the rest of the season . Heavy police guards searched 200,000 fans for guns , knives , rocks , bottles and vegetables . By a new law any home club that incites riots among the fans will have its stadium closed indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
