On July 31 , carry-over of U. S. cotton was 11,656,000 bales , an almost three-fold increase over a year ago . Since U. S. cotton consumption and exports last year totaled 11,432,000 bales , only 556,000 more than the estimated 1938-39 crop , prospects for a sizable reduction of this tremendous carry-over are dim indeed . Last week , cotton prices tumbled to 8.20 a lb. , making loans mandatory under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 , and Secretary of Agriculture Wallace singled out cotton as " perhaps the most difficult single situation with which we are faced . " <P> Scarcely less acute was the wheat problem , for which Secretary Wallace is seeking a partial solution in a subsidy scheme under which he hopes to export 100,000,000 bu. , about one-fourth the present U. S. surplus . To dump only 26,000,000 bu. abroad in 1934 , the U. S. spent $6,500,000 . However ingeniously conceived , a similar program now would not only add a neat expense item to AAA 's bulging budget but would almost certainly bring a squawk from Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subsidized U. S. wheat would have to compete in the world market against wheat subsidized this year by Canada , Poland and Rumania - with other overproducers expected to follow suit . <P> Whether or not this year 's surplus problems can be solved , the AAA last week fixed 1939 benefit payments at 26-to-30 a bu. , 14-18 above the 1938 rate , for U. S. wheat farmers who reduce their acreage 31% . Otherwise , next year 's crop-control program is substantially the same as this year 's . Total amount earmarked for 1939 benefit payments : $712,000,000.
