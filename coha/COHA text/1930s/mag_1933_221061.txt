At first the Bulgarian police , inexperienced in such things , were none too quick in detecting and suppressing the traffic . Recently , however , the Bulgarian authorities have proved themselves alert and effective in suppressing the traffic , as is indicated by the bulletin issued by the U. S. Department of State , issued Feb. 23 , 1933 which says in part : " The prompt action of the Bulgarian authorities in this matter , evidence as it is of their desire to cooperate in the international effort to suppress the abuse of narcotic drugs , is particularly pleasing to the United States , for as is well known , this country is one of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government of Bulgaria I should be grateful if you will be so good as to publish this letter . <P> <P> NEAL Dow BECKER <P> Consul General New York City <P> President 's Cigaret <P> Sirs : <P> This is not a matter of national importance but for the past three months the family has been arguing as to what brand of cigaret our President smokes .

It is one of the most amazingly true , fine and real likenesses of Pope Pius XI which has ever been made . I am having this framed for my desk because this picture of the Holy Father expresses that essentially military aspect of the Catholic Church characteristic of the Church Militant . It seems to best express the basic idea underlying Catholic Action . <P> Your write-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only one error , if I understand the thing correctly . You refer to St. Peter as the " founder of the Church . " Not correct . Christ founded the Catholic Church ; He built it on Peter ; Peter was the rock on which the Church was established . Your error is not a rare one . . . . <P> <P> FRANCIS GRILL St. Paul , Minn . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Long a maker of news in Jerusalem , Antioch , and Rome , last week Simon Bar-Jena ( might have ) made news in New York : <P> Into busy TIME office last week stamped baldpated , hooknosed , bewhiskered Ghost Peter . No wearer of rings , there hung from his gird loins the Fisherman 's Keys . Crashing through to the <P> Editor 's office he smashed his Douay down upon the desk and produced from a fold of his garment-TIME , April 3 . <P> Whisking it open to p. 19 he poked his pudgy finger to a spot that reads : " In a crypt beneath St. Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . " No writer of gospels himself , Peter thumbed his way to St. Matthew 16:18 , where he read : " Thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
