( 11.4,1r1.7 4 ? 4-7-14i SA PHEAD A STORY BY M. C. BLACKMAN I ' M TELLING you , Charlie , you 'd a laughed yourself sick if you could a seen that young saphead they sent down here one night while you was gone . Long as I been on the force  --  fourteen years next May  --  I never saw no such animal as that claiming to be a reporter . He was a scream from start to finish , and the finish was too close to the start to suit me , on account of I was getting a kick out of him , even if he did try to mess us up . You see , Joe was working in your place , but Joe got sick . It was a hangover , I guess , because the night before he was chasing to the can every fifteen minutes to pull on a bottle he swiped on a raid out in the West End , and about midnight he got so oiled up the Chief thought he was going to have to send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up for work next day . They must have been short-handed , or something , because they sent this young saphead down here to do police . Way I heard it , he was just out of some college up north and blew into your office and got a job . It being Sunday and not much doing , old Bill Davis sent him down here . I guess he knew he could count on us to see that the paper did n't miss out on anything big . Oh , we look out for you boys , Charlie , and you know it . I ai n't denying you do us a good turn now and then , but hell 's bells , that 's the way the police and newspapermen ought a work together , ai n't it ? Well , this young feller come in just after the three-to-eleven watch went on . " Good afternoon , gentlemen , " he says , very polite , stopping outside the cage there . We said hello , and Hank got up to wait on him , thinking he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name , " says this bird , " is Frederick Hughes , and I have just been employed by the Times . I was assigned to cover the police run to-day . " " Hell , " said Hank . " I thought you was a citizen and a taxpayer . " " I beg your pardon ? " this chap says , just like that . " Do n't mention it , " says Hank . " What 's the matter with Joe ? " He looked kind of blank and then he said , " Oh , he 's the man I 'm replacing , is n't he ? I understand he is sick . " We had a laugh at that . " Yeah , " I says , " I bet he 's nursing a head as big as a ashcan and has swore off again . " He could n't figure out what we was laughing at or what I was talking about , and we did n't bother to explain . Hank says , " Well , come on in , Freddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulletins and there 's the docket , and if you get stuck , ask the sergeant there . He 's used to fool questions from you guys . " " Yeah , " I says , " and do n't forget to say ' according to Sergeant Johnson ' when you write something you know is a damn ' lie . " ' Course I was just kidding , Charlie ; you guys do pretty good most of the time . Freddie give a grin at that and says , " You 've been misquoted by the press , I presume . " " Well , " I says , " we 'll call it that . " He come around behind the counter then and started looking over the docket and the bulletins . He was n't a bad-looking young feller all told , but he was sort of pale , and his eyes was real serious and thoughtful . The way he looked at you , you could tell he was sizing you up , but he did n't let on what he thought . It sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All in all , he just did n't look like no newspaperman we ever saw , and it did n't take us long to find out he did n't act like one . " Listen , " Hank says to him , " I 'm going to tell you the same as I tell all you guys . Lay off them bottles under the counter there . It 's evidence in them bottles , and we been bawled out by the judge a couple of times too many on account of lost evidence . " Remember , Charlie , that time you swiped a coupla them bottles and I followed you up to the office and got ' em back ? They was empty by that time , but we filled ' em again from another batch . You ought n't  --  but , never mind . I 'm getting away from this guy Hughes . He looked at Hank and says , " If it 's liquor , it 's safe from me . I do n't drink . " " My God ! " says me and Hank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he do n't drink . " He looked at us kind of funny for a minute and then made some crack about the " gentlemen of the press " which I did n't get . He started asking questions then about the arrests on the docket , and the bulletin reports . We could tell he was green ; so we give him some tips about the kind of stuff you and Joe write up . He made some notes and says thank you , and goes out . We do n't see him no more until after supper . When he come back after supper things had began to pick up a bit . You know how it is on Sunday night : speeders , and drunks , and nigger crap shooters , and four-sixteen eases . Lot of little eases which keep us hopping sometimes , but you all do n't pay noattention to ' em , on account of they ai n't any news to ' em . Well , this Freddie person sat down over there in the corner and took it all in with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , and they was n't much went on he did n't see and hear . But no matter how funny some of the things was  --  and you know what a laugh some of these niggers are  --  he never cracked a smile , but just looked on solemn , like he was learning every word was said by heart . He never said anything for a hour or so , and then he cut loose like he had gone nuts all of a sudden . It was when Bud Harmon brought in old Big-to-do for being drunk . You know how Big-to-do is ; they ai n't a better nigger in town when he 's sober , but when he 's drunk , he needs handling . When Bud and Hank started to take him downstairs he give Bud some short talk , and Bud banged him one in the mouth . With his fist , mind you . Bud never will learn to hit a nigger with his blackjack ; he gets all hot and mad , and is always bunging up his fist on some nigger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and when he hit Big-to-do he went down like a tree a-falling . Bud kicks him a coupla times for good measure , and they drug him off downstairs . He was bleeding some , but he was n't hurt . You could n't hurt Big-to-do with a sledge . Anyway , this young chap , Freddie , turned white like a ghost and shook all over . And when they come hack upstairs , he jumped up and went over and shook his finger at Bud . He called him a coward and a beast and said  --  I forget exactly what it was , but it went like this , " That was an unwarntecl piece of brutality . You had no excuse whatever for abusing him like that . " Bud was still kind of hot , and he looks at this guy and says , " What 'd you expect me to do ? Kiss him ? " " You would n't dare treat a white man like that , " young Freddie raves . " Say , who the hell are you , any-SAPHEAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " Who 's this nigger lover ? " he wants to know . Hank took Bud off and explained things to him , while I calmed the young squirt down . " Do n't get all excited over nothing , " I told him . " That coon was n't hurt none . You could n't hurt him with nothing short of a double-bit axe . " " It 's not that , " he says . " The officer took advantage of a defenseless , drunken negro simply because he was a negro . What he said to the officer was not insulting , and even if it had been , he was drunk and not responsible . " I forget what it was Big-to-do said to Bud . It was n't much of anything ; it was just the way he said it made Bud mad . You know , short and sulky , like he was thinking a lot more'n he said . Anyway , this Freddie railed on a eoupla minutes , harping on it being a nigger and not a white man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up North , ai n't you , Buddy ? " I asked him . " What if I am ? " he says . " It 's just that you do n't understand niggers and the way we got to handle ' em sometimes , " I told him . " You 'll get used to it in time if you stick around here . " " Not as long as I remain civilized , " he comes back . I got to thinking over that crack later and figured out he just as good as said we ai n't civilized . But I did n't pay no attention then , because I was getting kind of tired of all this to-do over nothing . So I says : " Well , that 's the way we do things down here , and if you want to get along with us , you 'd better pipe down . You wo n't get no place calling the boys cowards and other names . " " Perhaps you are right , " he says . " I know I 'm right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He calmed down then and took things easy for a while . But he watched everything that went on , and every now and then he 'd ask me some questions . Like when a couple of the riders broughtin half a dozen niggers for shooting craps . They was a white man with ' cm , some mechanic that worked in the shop where they was shooting in the back end . We took five bucks bond apiece from the niggers  --  them that had it  --  and ten from the white man , like we always do . Young Freddie noticed that . " Why do you require different bonds for the same offense ? " he wanted to know . " Niggers just naturally ca n't help shooting craps , " I told him , " and white men are supposed to know better . So we stick white men more . " " I see , " he says " The same law with different applications . Working to the advantage of the black citizen this time . " That 's what he said ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his gal on a four-sixteen charge , and this goofy reporter come up with some more questions while they was making bonds of ten bucks each . " What bond would be required of a white couple for this offense ? " he asked . I told him twenty-five bucks Then he wanted to know where the nigger couple was arrested . " Oh , she 's been laying up with him for some time , " I says . " I do n't know if it was his place or hers , " When they left he followed ' em out in the hall , and I heard him ask how long they 'd been living together . The boy told him it was about a year , so then he asked them why they had n't got married . The gaI said they just had n't got around to getting their papers yet but she guessed they would to-morrow because the papers would be cheaper than having the law on ' em . I wondered what the hell difference all that made to Freddie ; he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-sixteen case . You and Joe never paid no attention to stuff like that . But this guy seemed to have gone nuts on the subject of niggers . I was getting kind of a kick out of the way he was acting ; he was so serious and all . So when there come a call for the wagon over in the Bottoms , I asked him did he want to go along . Hank was on the ' phones , and Ed was downstairs ; so they was nobody to ride the wagon but me . I thought maybe he 'd see something else to get all hot and bothered over . He said yes , he 'd like to go along with me . Scotty did n't say when he ' phoned in , but I figured from the address it must be old Mary 's place they 'd raided , and , sure enough , it was . We turned off the Drive , drove down some of those nigger quarter side-streets deep in the Bottoms , and stopped in a alley side-street in front of Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for us , and Jack was in back . This new reporter was all eyes when we went in . I do n't know if you 've ever been to Mary 's place or not , but she 's got it fixed up pretty nice . Her old man is a brakeman , and she works out , too ; so they kind of put on the dog a little . The house is some better'n most of them shotgun shacks in the Bottoms , and old Mary has got a victrola and a pianer and some other doo-dads . The young niggers like to go to her place , and old Mary likes to have ' em , and always has brew . They was seven couples there , all told , if I recall it right , and Scotty and Jack had corralled ' em all in the front room . Old Mary was moanin ' and grumbling like she always does ; you know how she carries on . " Lawd hab mercy , " she kept saying , " somepin done tole me I better had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a res ' instid er all dese heap fumadiddlcs . Lawd hab mercy . " " Ride ' em all ? " I asked Scotty . " Yeah , " he says , " they was all dancing and carrying on . We found thirty bottles of home brew and some whiskey glasses , but we did n't find no booze . Hold on a couple of shakes till we look again . " Scotty and Jack went around looking into closets and boxes and things , while old Mary begun moanin ' louder'n ever . " Lawdy , Cap'n , " she said , " dcy ai n't no whiskey in dis house , I swear . Dey ai n't been none since I do n't know when . Dem little glasses is jus ' keep-sakes . " Jack said , " Shut up , " and they went on looking . Then this saphead reporter went over to old Mary and he said , " Are you the lady of the house ? " That 's what he said , " Arc you the lady of the house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mistuh ? " she sort of gasped . " Is this your home ? " Freddie then asked . " Go ' long , white folks , " said Mary . " Y'all know dis is my house . I been livin ' hcah since I do n't know when . " " And these people are your guests ? " the goof asks , waving at the niggers sitting around . " Who ? Dem ? " says Mary . " Dey jus ' some triflin ' niggers come over heah to pleasure theyselves wid old Mary . " " Then , " says Freddie , " your entertainment of them is not commercial ? You do n't sell your refreshments ? " Mary says , " Mistuh , film de way you-all tawks , you sho mils ' be a lawyer . Well , I got me a lawyer . Mistuh Schultz , he takes care of me and all my law business . " Jack and Scotty come in then and said they could n't find no liquor . " Take ' em away , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of ' em with disturbing the peace . " We marched ' em all out and put ' em in the wagon . Freddie got in front with me and we started back to headquarters . And how that guy did rave ! Charlie , I 'm telling you ; he 'd plain gone nuts . He kept talking sarcastic about what a fine , uplifting business it was for policemen to go breaking into a private home , where they was having a harmless , peaceable party , and drag all the guests and the " hostess " down to jail like they was murderers and thieves . " Hell , " I says , " they was dancing , and that 's against the law on Sunday . " " Disturbing the peace ! " says this guy . " Who was disturbed , pray tell me , " he says . " There are no white people living in that neighborhood , are there ? " " Of course not , " I says . " That 's the nigger quarter . " " Well , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Certainly not their neighbors ' , " he says . " Well , " I says , " it 's against the law to dance on Sunday , and that 's the charge  --  disturbing the peace . Besides , " I says , " do n't you ever believe old Mary was putting out her home brew free . She was making ' em all chip in to pay for it . We did n't see her collect for any of it , so the charge is just possessing liquor for sale . " " You do n't raid the homes of white people when they 're having private home brew parties , do you ? " he asked . " Listen , feller , " I says . " It 's like this : If we do n't raid these coons now and then , they get to thinking we 've forgot all about ' em , and they go hog-wild . We got to let ' em know we 're keeping a eye on them all the time . " " I see , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say no more for a while , but just sat there thinking about I do n't know what . He said he saw what I was driving at , but I knew he did n't savvy at all . We come back along the Drive , and just as we was passing Colonel Morgan 's big house there on the Drive , this Freddie set up sudden and grabbed me by the arm . " Wait a minute ! " he says . " Stop ! " I slammed on the brakes and stopped without even thinking . I did n't know what the hell had happened . " What 's the matter ? " I asked him . " Look ! " he says , pointing at Colonel Morgan 's house , which was lit up in the front room and the shades all up . " Look ! " says this guy . " They 're having a party in there , and dancing . It 's against the law . And I 'll bet if you go in you 'll find more to drink than homebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest all those people ? " I begun to get sore . " Listen , " I says , " you was funny for a while , but you ai n't funny no more . " Before I could start up again , young Ted Morgan got out of a car where he was sitting with some girl and come over to see what was going on . He had a pretty good load on and was weaving when he come up to the wagon . " Hello , Chief , " he says to me . " Want something ? No ? We 're having a little party . Swell party . Wait a minute , " he says , " and I 'll bring you out a drink . No ? Come see us again sometime . " I told him he better get back in the house and then I drove off again . I looked at this saphead reporter , and he was laughing to beat hell . Not making any noise , just laughing to himself quiet like . " You 're a smart guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he comes back , " but I 'm being educated rapidly . " When we got back to headquarters Hank docketed all the niggers . Some of ' em put up bonds of five bucks each for disturbing the peace and went on about their business . While I was searching the rest of ' em , getting ready to lock ' cm up until somebody could come down and bail ' em out , I heard this sap reporter talking to old Mary some more . You wo n't hardly believe it , Charlie , but it 's the truth . He was calling her Mrs. Martin ! It was Mrs. Martin this and Mrs. Martin that , just as polite as if he was talking to the mayor 's wife . Well , when I finally got through searching them that was to go downstairs , I looked around and Freddie was gone . I was going to ask him did n't he want to go downstairs and stay with the coons a while , seeing he was so fond of them and all . Old Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others that did n't have no money , and then I locked ' em up to wait . Schultz always takes his time about coming down , you know . Me and Hank and Ed sat around talking about this funny reporter and wondering how Iong he 'd last . Just before the end of our watch , when we was getting ready to check out , Freddie come in again . He had a topcoat on his arm and was carrying a suitcase . " Well , gentlemen , " he says , grinning with his mouth but not with his eyes , " you have witnessed one of the briefest journalistic careers on record . " " You mean , you 're quitting ? " I asked . " In a manner of speaking , " he says , in that same flowery way he always talked . " You see , " he says , " it was my innocent belief that a newspaper reporter should write accurately and con  - -  con ? " Well , he went on to say he thought you guys was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter whose toes got stepped on . " It seems I was mistaken , " he says . " I turned in my story to Mr. Bill Davis , the city editor . Mr. Bill Davis returned it to me with the suggestion that I send it to the Chicago Defender . " That 's the name of that nigger newspaper , ai n't it , Charlie ? " Well , " he says , " I thanked him for the suggestion , and told him I thought perhaps I 'd better take the story to Chicago myself . He agreed that it was a splendid idea . So I 'm on my way . " " Going to Chicago , eh ? " I asks , just to be polite . " On second thought , " says this bird , " I 've decided not to bother with taking my masterpiece along . " He pulled some sheets of typewriting out of his pocket and pitched ' em down on the counter . " I 'll just make you gentlemen a present of my journalistic swan song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've got that stuff he wrote around here somewhere . It was all about the raid on Mary 's place , and it seemed like he was trying to give us the razz . It was terrible sarcastic , and kind of a dirtyway to write about us boys when we 'd treated him friendly and all . No wonder Davis would n't print it . But let me finish telling you about Freddie . Before he left , he says , " How much bond do you want to release the hostess of to-night 's party ? " " You mean old Mary ? " Hank asks . " A hundred bucks 'll get her out . She 's waiting to be bailed out now . " This crazy feller pulled out a roIl of bills and peeled off a hundred bucks and pitched it down on the counter . " Release her , " he says , " with my compliments . I 've always paid for my education , " he says , " and I feel I 've learned more to-night than I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and give us a polite bow , and says , " I 'm going to Chicago and apply to Al Capone for respectable employment . After all , " lie says , " a civilized man must draw the line at some professions . " He left then , and that was the last we saw of Freddie . But the funniest thing was the way old Mary acted when we brought her upstairs . We told her that her bond was made and who made it . And old Mary says : " Ne ' mind none cr dat , Cap'n . I do n't want nothing to do wid sech white folks . I wouldn ' tech dat money wid a fawty-foot pole . Dat white man sho inns ' be crazy in de haid , or else he tryin ' to make a fool out er dis ole nigger . How come he make such fool tawk wid me ? Foxin " round callin ' me Miz Martin . Humph ! Ne ' mind , Cap'n , I gwine wait right heah to Mister Schultz come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , nobody seemed to know where the saphead come from , or where he went to ; so the Chief finally took the hundred bucks and put it in the Policemen 's Benefit Fund . So we come out ahead in the long run . But , say , Charlie , why 'd he call that tripe he wrote a swan song ? What 's a swan song ?
