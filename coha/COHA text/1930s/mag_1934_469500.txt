on their backs , a number of r giant American railways are being prepared for the major surgery of reorganization . Meanwhile , with these breadwinners in the bankruptcy hospitals , their dependents ? tens of thousands of investors in their bonds and stocks ? are suffering , and circles far beyond these ; for the curtailed income of investors means less money to spend and circulate . Many of them have cut down on house repairs , on clothes , some of them even on food , as anyone acquainted with small investors can testify . So the default of big railroads is felt in a measure by the painter and carpenter , the shopkeeper , butcher , and dairy farmer , and by the countless numbers who supply them . Savings also have been affected . The shrinkage in the sales value of first-mortgage bonds of railroads now bankrupt runs into hundreds of millions of dollars , to say nothing of the hundreds of millions of additional investment in many other varieties of their bonds , and the loss of hundreds of millions more in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average investor can be told by any man who bought ten shares of Missouri Pacific above par in 3906 . To protect his investment against dilution through one of the company 's methods of financing in /909 , and to protect himself against the wiping out of his stock investment when the company went into receivership in 1915 , he bought $800 worth of its bonds . His$1800 of investments , if sold at the high point of the speculative boom of 1929 , would have just barely netted him a profit ; if sold at the height of the August , 1934 , rise they would have brought him less than $100 . One would hardly have expected some of these railroads to break down so badly . Missouri Pacific Railroad , St. Louis-San Francisco Railway , and Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railway had given up their youthful ambition to go over the mountains to the Pacific Coast and had apparently settled down into middle-aged caution . Their physical condition was and is good . The territory they serve has been a developing section . They came through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have survived the depression if it had not been for a dread malady which was merely brought to a head in the unhealthy climate of the past few years . To know what this malady was one must study the histories of the railroads . They are much the same , and the story of the Missouri Pacific will in the main tell the story of the others as well . It was born on Independence Day , 1851 . In its infancy during the sixties and the seventies , the doctor came often and even administered the receivership cure . Thereafter it grew in size by a series of consolidations with other railroads . In this process it avoided the greatest danger of railroad finance ? the danger of loading itself I with debt . It would have run into this danger if it had bought the stock of the other railroad companies , for then it would have had to borrow money to pay for that stock . Wiser than some in the business , it absorbed other roads by giving their stockholders shares of Missouri Pacific in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the beginning of the century , and additional roads were acquired by purchase of their shares of stock . To finance these deals Mop ( as hurried brokers in Wall Street call the railroad ) borrowed a great deal of money . Its bankers lent a helping hand , and many million dollars ' worth of bonds were sold to the public . The European world , as well as the American , was given an opportunity to put its savings into this ever-expanding , sprawling giant . Its bonds were sold and listed on stock exchanges in New York , in Amsterdam , in Zurich , in Geneva . The methods followed by Missouri Pacific as it gorged itself with other railroads brought about three important consequences . First , as a result of the creation of more and more bond issues , the road was obliged to pay large fees to its hankers , and , in smaller amount , to big New York trust companies which acted as trustees for the bondholders , as agents of the company in paying the interest on the bonds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purchase of the stocks of other railroads involved it in speculative ventures and before long in heavy losses . Third , and worst of all , the method of issuing bonds in order to pay for stocks of other roads involved the Missouri Pacific deeply in debt . The enterprise was now so waterlogged that it was ready to capsize in the first storm . A convenient storm was provided by the outbreak of the World War in1914 . The company was unable to pay the interest charges on its precariously large debt , and its bankers decided to put it out of its misery by killing it in the receivership court and creating a new company to take over the business . Its chief bankers , Kuhn Loeb &; Co. , helped to form so-called protective committees to protect the security holders of the road , and two of the partners of this banking firm and some of its friends became members of the two principal committees . The Kuhn Loeb lawyers became the legal guides of the most important committee , and one of the law firms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan g : Co. undertook the guidance of the other principal committee . II When the bankers set to work on this reorganization they assumed a role described to a United States Senate Committee last year by a Kuhn Loeb partner . He said that his firm 's clients come to it with their problems on the theory that " Dr. Kuhn Loeb &; Co. is a pretty good doctor to go to . " The firm visited the ailing Missouri Pacific in 1914 and reported after examination and diagnosis that the railroad could not earn enough to pay the interest on its mountain of debt . The bankers said that for every dollar of capitalization , the company owed seventy-seven cents . This ratio , said the bankers , was much too high . They evolved a plan under which some of the bondholders would take stock in return for their bonds , thus reducing the total debt of the company . The plan reduced the amount of interest the company would have to pay and , consequently , the income that bondholders would get in the form of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock for their bonds were given a speculaTHE CASE OF THE Live chance to get dividends on this stock , and though the company had paid no dividends for nine years , there was always the possibility that the tide might turn . This method of reducing fixed charges by giving bondholders stock for their bonds is the usual practice in reorganizations and is regarded by many as inevitable . Kuhn Loeb indicated that their plan reduced the debts to the point where the Missouri Pacific owed sixty cents for every dollar of capitalization of its property . However , this capitalization assumed that the property was correctly valued at the figures carried on the books . The Interstate Commerce Commission subsequently valued the proper ty for rate-making purposes , fixing the amount $100,000,000 below the company 's valuation . If the Interstate Commerce Commission figures may be accepted as within the range of reliability , the condition of the company might be described in the language used by Poor 's Manual about some of the Mop bond issues during its receivership : " Margin of Safety : Nil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time regarded by its authors as highly successful . They created two new classes of Missouri Pacific bonds . The better of the two were called First and Refunding Mortgage bonds . The bankers presented some estimates , and on the basis of these estimates suggested that the railway was likely to earn twice as much as was needed to pay the interest on the First and Refunding bonds . The bankers and their supporting protective committees induced investors in some of the old bonds to take $46,000,000 of the First and Refunding bonds in exchange . The bankers announced that more of these bonds could be " advantageously marketed . " They were right . In ensuing years they helped the company get from the public the purchase price of more than $200,000,000 of these bonds , less the commissions paid to the bankers . The general public still holds almost a quarter of a billion of these securities , which sold at the height of the August , 1934 , rise at about twenty-five cents on the dollar . The other class of new bonds created by the bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the name given to them . They were called by the bankers New General Mortgage Four Per Cent Gold Bonds . The bankers said that , on the basis of the estimates , the property would be likely to earn a good deal more than was necessary to pay the interest on these bonds , indeed , enough more to yield 31/2 per cent on the new common stock . These remunerative securities were sold to the stockholders of the bankrupt company , who were thus enabled to acquire $41,000,000 of the gold bonds for that amount of cash , with the new common stock thrown in free , like coupons at a cigar store . As things turned out , however , the common stock never paid any dividends , even in the boom years , when large earnings were reported ; and the gold bonds could have been sold by their present owners during the August , 1934 , rise at ten cents on the dollar . The cash that security holders paid for the gold bonds in 1917 was needed for a number of purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. received for their job as reorganizers $1,283,385 . The public has not been told what additional amounts they received for running an underwriting syndicate in connection with the plan . Nor does the public know how much was paid to the other bankers on the committees , to the trust companies which were used as depositaries and ultimately as cremation plants for the old bonds , and to the lawyers . The courteous security holder who chipped in to help pay these fees but was too delicate to pry into the private affairs of his payees , must make his own estimates . He was given one bit of information that may be of some help to him for the purpose . He was given ( as is usually done in reorganizations ) a long list of items for which money was required , and if he read the closely printed words with care he saw , at about the middle , the words " reorganization expenses . " He was then furnished with an omnibus figure , a round sum to cover the entire list of items . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the new ratio of debt to total assets were not the only contributions of the 1917 reorganization . Reorganizers have to see to it that a new company starts out under proper guidance . The directorate to whom this task was entrusted included such men as Mr. Albert H. Wiggin of the Chase Nacional Bank and three others of the committeemen who had helped to shape the Kuhn Loeb plan and had given it their support . On the new board were such men as the head of the Wabash Railway , which was also emerging from receivership , the road in whose securities Missouri Pacific had invested and lost heavily . Kuhn Loeb &; Co. did not formally go on the board of directors , though their attorneys soon became counsel for the road and , while continuing to act as attorneys for the bankers , represented the railroad in subsequent dealings with the bankers for the flotation of securities to the public . The bankers were sanguine when they got the Missouri Pacific off to such a start as has been described . They organized the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will now be in order to see why the bankers ' brave aspiration wasburst so soon , as though the reorganization they produced were a mere soap bubble . III The sixteen years in which the Missouri Pacific actually traveled from one bankruptcy to another may be divided into three periods ? six years of swaddling clothes and adolescence , eight years of activity and bustle , and two years of sickness and regrets . In the first period the bankers did not have much to do . These were the years of financing of the railroads by the government , exercising , as it did , its wartime control until 1920 and thereafter lending to railroads during the minor depression that came to a close in 1922 . During this interval there were a few changes in the board of directors . Mr. Wiggin retired , though , as subsequently appeared , he stood ready to lend the helping hand of his bank when need arose . Capital . ists such as John J. Raskob and Matthew C. Brush were added . In view of the securities policy followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that Mr. Brush was subsequently described to a United States Senate Committee by one of his associates in stock-market pool operations as a big trader in the stock market . Another change in the Missouri Pacific board was the elevation to the chief post in the company of a man who had been for years an officer of another railway for which Kuhn Loeb were the bankers . The breathing space accorded to the Mop board and bankers after its reorganization enabled them to look round and find good pickings for it . Many bones were strewn all over the railway map at the time , as a result of the numerous receiverships of the nineteen tens and early nineteen twenties . One was Gulf Coast Lines , tossed upon the receivership dump when a big rail- THE CASE OF THE MISSOURI PACIFIC 91 way in control of it was dismembered . Gulf Coast Lines , some time after it was reorganized , had the banking assistance of two New York firms . One firm was Blair &; Co. , under the leadership of Elisha Walker . The other was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blair &; Co. had been represented for years on the directorates of both the Gulf Coast Lines and the Missouri Pacific , though its partners withdrew from the latter shortly before the deal to which we are coming . The head of the other firm had helped to reorganize Gulf Coast Lines some years earlier , had served on its board for many years , and had risen to the chief office in that company . By that time he had also become head of the Harriman firm . No banking firm other than the Blairs and Harrimans had direct representation on the Gulf Coast Lines board , though one of the Kuhn Loeb attorneys had been on the board for many years . An arrangement was made in 1924 to merge the Missouri Pacific and the Gulf Coast Lines . This was not to be done by the old sound method of giving the stockholders in both companies stock of a consolidated road . Instead , use was made of the plan that helped to wreck Missouri Pacific ten years earlier . Missouri Pacific bought the stock of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing its debts and the amount of interest it would have to pay each year . A majority of the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission permitted this method of payment ; but the men in charge of the railroad had the benefit of a warning from Commissioner Eastman , the present Federal Coordinator of railroads . He said , in a minority opinion , that " the merger . . . is objectionable in form because it substitutes debt for railroad stock . . . at a time when the railroads of the country , including the Missouri Pacific , have far too heavy a burden of debt in comparison with . . . their properties . " The Missouri Pacific paid a good deal to the bankers who claimed to have put this merger together . It was estimated by members of the Interstate Commerce Commission that the banking firms headed by the two Walkers , who in form were getting paid by the stockholders of Gulf Coast Lines , might total a profit of $900,000 , and that Kuhn Loeb might get as much as $225,000 . Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of thousands of dollars belonging to security holders . " He noted that even the majority of the Commission , who felt they had no power to prevent what was being done , condemned it " in unmeasured terms . " The majority said that the transaction had aspects " so unfortunate as to cause hesitancy , " and added : " The bankers ... are to receive compensation or profit .. . apparently in excess of $1,000,000 . It has been represented to us that the stockholders desire to sell and the applicant ( Missouri Pacific ) desires to purchase . The warrant under such circumstances for the interposition of the activity of bankers at the vast expense mentioned to the parties is not clear . " Commissioner Eastman added some comments applicable also to subsequent deals made by Missouri Pacific . He said that the evidence with respect to this merger confirmed his view about railroad consolidations , that " the chief beneficiaries for some years would be the bankers and lawyers in charge of the negotiations . " He also referred to the fact that particular bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " One of the defenses offered for this variety of monopoly , which is widely prevalent in the railroad world , is that by such an arrangement a railroad enlists the friendly interest and advice of an experienced firm of bankers . In this case it does not appear that the Missouri Pacific secured such friendly interest and advice at any thing less than the current market price . " At about the same time Missouri Pacific indirectly bore part of the expense for bankers ' advice and guidance in the reorganization of two other railroads , in which it had a large investment . Kuhn Loeb did the reorganizing in both cases , receiving a fee of $200,000 for the revamping of the Texas &; Pacific Railway , and sharing with another reorganizer ( Equitable Trust Co. of New York ) a fee of $300,000 for the reorganization of the Denver &; Rio Grande . The reorganization of Texas &; Pacific gave control of that road to Mop . But its board , almost with a collector 's passion , went out to buy more of the Texas &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money in this buying campaign that it almost doubled its holdings of the common , in addition to owning all the preferred . Mop also invested $10,000,000 in securities under the plan for the reorganization of the Denver &; Rio Grande , in which Mop had previously been interested . Missouri Pacific 's buying policy was turning out to be a highly successful method of increasing its indebtedness . It was in 1924 that the three deals just described , relating to Gulf Coast Lines , Texas &; Pacific , and Denver &; Rio Grande , started the new Missouri Pacific on the old Missouri Pacific policy . Its purchase of Gulf Coast Lines gave Mop control of a fourth road , International-Great Northern , which had been acquired by Gulf Coast Lines a few months earlier . That acquisition is of interest in our story for two reasons . The fees paid to bankers in the reorganization of International-Great Northern shortly before , andagain when its stock was acquired by Gulf Coast Lines , left the treasuries of these two companies proportionately less well supplied with cash when Mop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mop 's burdens , when it had to lend money to Gulf Coast Lines in order to replenish the depleted treasury of the latter . It is also of interest to see how small is the banking world that serves the railroads . Among those who reorganized International-Great Northern , sold its stock to Gulf Coast Lines , and received fees on both occasions , was Mr. Strauss of the banking firm of J. &; W. Seligman &; Co. , who helped Kuhn Loeb reorganize both Missouri Pacific and Denver &; Rio Grande . To return to the Mop policy of effecting consolidations by stock purchases and debt increases . It now had large interests in four important roads . The policy looked so attractive to its directors that they imposed it on Mop 's subsidiaries . In the two years after it secured Gulf Coast Lines , the latter bought control of half a dozen other railroads . Within a few years thereafter , another subsidiary , Texas Pacific , purchased control of another half dozen . The deeper-into-debt plan infected even the sub-subsidiaries , and one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sub-sub-subsidiary , also now bankrupt . As late as the last year in which Kuhn Loeb were bankers for Missouri Pacific it was still buying control of roads , concluding the Kuhn Loeb period with the purchase of a railway which in turn bought another , and not long afterward was put into bankruptcy beside the parent company . IV The glorious career of Missouri Pacific as master collector of bones from the reorganization abattoirs came to a THE CASE OF THE close in 1929 . The control of the company changed hands . The general public did not know it at the time , but learned it before the publication of the company 's 1930 report . That report furnishes some interesting details for one who can jigsaw his way through to facts of which there is just a hint in railway company reports . In addition to changes in the membership of the board of directors , there were other changes . The names of two Kuhn Loeb lawyers , Mr. Cravath and Mr. de Gersdorff , disappeared from the list of Missouri Pacific officers . Another change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk who had long been the company 's stock transfer agent . These and other items confirmed the news that the Van Sweringens had taken possession . Through their Alleghany Corporation , floated by them with the aid of the Morgan firm , Missouri Pacific was taken off the railroad chessboard it had roamed at will , and transferred to a bigger board on which it was merely a pawn . Now began an era for Missouri Pacific that put the Kuhn Loeb years of 1922 to 1929 in the shade . Though some of the stock purchases of those years had by a process of accumulation become quite sizable , each single bite was a small one , a few hundred thousand or a few millions at a time . This piddling policy was discarded . After the Van Sweringens acquired control they sold the Missouri Pacific a $20 , - 000.000 lot of properties at one clip . They had acquired this lot as a result of their natural interest , as real estate promoters , in development sites and sites adjoining railroad terminal properties in two Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Sweringens the money raised by Alleghany Corpora-tion when it sold its bonds to the public early tha did that not year . do so The well Alleghany with this company purchase or with some of the other securities it bought in 1929 , before the stock market crash . The Van Sweringens explained later , after they had sold the development and terminal properties to Missouri Pacific in December , 1930 , that they had bought them originally for Missouri Pacific , and had all along kept it clear in their own minds that the properties were to be transferred to Mop . The one thing they were anxious about , they said , was that they should not make any profit at Mop 's expense , since it was under their control . So , in the depression of December , 1930 , the properties were sold to Missouri Pacific at the price paid for them by the Van Sweringens in the boom days of 1929 . Not quite the same price , as the Van Sweringens thought it would be only fair to add to the price paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom to depression . As one of them put it to the Alleghany bondholders in 1934 , when that corporation also was being reorganized , a contract was made with Missouri Pacific , " looking to the purchase of these properties by the Missouri Pacific .. . at not to exceed their cost to Alleghany Corporation plus interest . " Under the Van Sweringen management Missouri Pacific did another sort of buying of railroad stocks . Having bought up almost every railroad within reach , it began to buy up itself . It put millions of dollars into the purchases of its own securities . Whether or not the purpose in this case was similar to that frequently found in the case of such swallowing of one 's own tail , it may be interesting to note what has been the motivation in other instances of such buying . In case of a fight , those already in control of a corporation can continue themselves in office by voting the company-owned stock . To be sure , Missouri Pacific did not buy in its own name . It merely put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of account of the railroad and certain of its subsidiaries , one might gather that the buying of Missouri Pacific stock was for the subsidiaries . One of them , a motor-bus company , was apparently the first to do such buying . It got off the highway just long enough to purchase thousands of shares of Missouri Pacific stock and hundreds of thousands of dollars of Missouri Pacific convertible bonds . Missouri Pacific 's books showed that the money spent for these securities was really a loan by Missouri Pacific to its motor-bus subsidiary . Nevertheless , it could not be forgotten that the motor-bus company was just a motor-bus company , organized as an auxiliary of a huge railroad , and not to buy up that railroad . The bus company transferred the Missouri Pacific shares to another Mop subsidiary , called an improvement company . The latter gave its note to the bus company for approximately $3,600,000 , the amount charged to the bus company by Missouri Pacific . This amount was almost three-quarters of a million dollars more than Missouri Pacific paid for the securities when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its own subsidiaries covered a loss taken by Missouri Pacific on some other dealings in its own securities . The result of such transactions and their routing from one company to another was that the reports issued to security holders did not make clear the buying of the Missouri Pacific securities by the company or its subsidiaries , the loss actually taken on some of the securities , or the market loss sustained on those still retained . Other ! inter-company transactions were not wholly clear to Missouri Pacific security holders who read the company 's annual reports . For instance , it included in its income the dividendspaid to it by its subsidiaries . It received dividends , in depression years , greater than the earnings of some of the subsidiaries that paid them . The difference between earnings made by certain of the companies controlled by Missouri Pacific and the dividends they paid to it while it was dictating their dividend policy ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars . In the case of one of the most important of the subsidiaries , Missouri Pacific made loans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth between two members of this corporate family , Mop returning in the form of loans what it received in the form of dividends . So far as the books and the published reports showed , the subsidiary had increased its debts , and the parent company had larger earnings than it would otherwise have been able to report . Whatever the reason and purpose of such methods of bookkeeping , the net effect was to give temporary support to a delicate financial pyramid . The Van Sweringen interests and the banks and bankers who had become involved with the Van Sweringens were at the top of this pyramid . The banks and bankers had made large loans to the Van Sweringen companies , the total finally rising to $40,000,000 . The ability of the borrowers to pay this money , and of the lenders to collect the vast sums they had advanced , depended in considerable part on the value of the property that was pledged to protect these loans . Much of the property that was pledged to secure the loans was in the form of common stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn dependent on the assets of that company , and a substantial part of its assets was stock of the Missouri Pacific . The value of the Mop stock was up or down , as the railroad earned money or failed to earn money , and as it had profits on some of its investments or speculations , or lost money on them . THE CASE OF THE The bookkeeping methods it followed failed to show losses on certain of its speculations , and failed to disclose adequately to the public the nature of some of its reported income . This helped the market value of the Mop stock temporarily , and , in turn , of the Alleghany stock and , in turn , the position of the Van Sweringen companies with respect to their loans , and incidentally , in turn , the banks and bankers who had made those loans . V It is now time to turn from bookkeeping acrobatics to the consequences of those activities which constitute one of the main currents of Missouri Pacific history , the activities involved in buying up other railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up to Mop 's previous bankruptcy . The constant selling of bonds in order to finance the purchase of other companies ' stocks , as well as for other purposes , cost a great deal of money . In the eight years before the Morgan firm displaced the Kuhn Loeb firm as bankers for the company , Missouri Pacific and its affiliated companies sold to Kuhn Loeb , who in turn sold to the public , about $325,000,000 of bonds . In addition , the company , backed up by a Kuhn Loeb underwriting , sold to stockholders some $46,000 , - 000 of bonds . The difference between the prices at which the securities were offered to the public and at which the company sold them to Kuhn Loeb was approximately $10,000,000 . The commissions secured by the bankers and the members of their syndicates did not represent the entire cost to the company . The bankers ' lawyers had to be paid . Big New York banks , especially the Guaranty Trust Company , had to be paid by the company for acting as trustees for the purchasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , another had to be created in order to raise the money to pay the first , and again fees were payable to bankers , banks , and lawyers . Besides the expense of financing , Missouri Pacific sustained large losses on the railroad stocks it had purchased . As prices dropped during the depression , the market value of the million shares of stock owned by Missouri Pacific and two of its subsidiaries also declined . Indeed , a large portion of these holdings are shares of companies that are now in bankruptcy . Missouri Pacific alone has $92,000,000 in the securities of affiliated companies , some of which have already run up net deficits of $27,000,000 since the acquisition of their shares by Mop . Whether there are corresponding deficits in the other affiliates can not be stated at this moment , because the books of these others had not been examined by the accountants of the court when they reported in June of this year . Large as were the costs of financing and the losses on the 1,000,000 share acquisitions , their importance is lost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus in the amount of interest charges Missouri Pacific had to earn . Every one of the company 's annual reports in the ten-year period beginning with 1922 carried the ominous news of ever-mounting debt . One of the most striking transactions was in the third year of the present depression . Everyone who had engaged in financing the Missouri Pacific in the past was called in to help the road 's bankers try to plug the holes in the sinking ship with investors ' money . An underlying bond issue was about to mature . Partly to retire this bond issue , the Morgan firm , the Kuhn Loeb firm , the Guaranty Trust Company , the Chase National Bank ( which had absorbed Equitable Trust Company ) , and others sold $61,000,000 of new Mop bonds to the public . This was in 1931 . Earnings continued to dwindle , and two years later the company was in bankruptcy . The investment which the public made in 1931 was worth , at the height of the August , 1934 , rise , about $15,000,000 . Despite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain funds from the investing public finally came to an end . There was still , of course , the possibility of leaning on the taxpayers of the entire country , and borrowing from the national government . A bill to create a governmental agency to make loans to railroads was rushed through Congress . Before the ink was dry on the statute books the Van Sweringens , to quote their testimony at a Congressional Committee hearing , " were sitting on their doorstep waiting for them to open . . . . We were afraid it would not get finished in time . " Missouri Pacific got loan after loan of government money . A dispute arose quite early in this process of relying on the national treasury . Missouri Pacific wanted a number of millions of dollars in order to pay money it owed to its bankers . Members of the Interstate Commerce Commission criticized this method of facilitating the flow of credit : it seemed to them to be an indirect method of giving government help to private bankers in Wall Street , who had been expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission recalled that Mop 's bankers " have profited largely in handling its financing in the past . " Commissioner Eastman denied that " there is any need for using government funds to bail out these bankers . " Finally the bankers got some $5,000,000 of the government money in this way . The road kept on borrowing from Uncle Sam for other purposes as well , and before the government authorities refused to lend any more , Missouri Pacific had succeeded in getting a total of$23,000,000 of the public money , and in increasing its already huge indebtedness . At the end of the long road , like the road it had traveled only a half generation before , there was the tottering Missouri Pacific , owing sixty-seven per cent of all it claimed to own . If its speculations and those of its subsidiaries were written down to current values , it probably owed 80 cents out of every dollar it owned . And if its railroad plant were valued as the Interstate Commerce Commission valued it , Missouri Pacific was hopelessly insolvent . So they sent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eight subsidiaries and subsubsidiaries went with it . Then the protective committees began to rise up on every side . Looking at the names on some of the committees , one might think that it was Old Home Week on the Missouri Pacific . On the principal committee is to be found a partner of Kuhn Loeb &; Co. and a partner of J. P. Morgan Fic Co . The depositary of the committee is the Guaranty Trust Company of New York , which served in a similar capacity in the last reorganization of the road . The make-up of this committee is a reminder of the fact that so-called protective committees , when organized by the group which has figured so prominently in Missouri Pacific affairs , follow set patterns . This committee is so like the chief bondholders ' committee in the most recent big reorganization , that of the St. Paul Railway , that one can almost mistake the one for the other . Both offered to protect bond issues of about $225,000,000 . Each had in its membership two of the company 's bankers , executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an association of mutual savings banks , and an official of a philanthropic foundation .

This they promptly did , arranged all the details , framed up the committees favorably to themselves , put themselves on the bondholders ' protective committee and constituted themselves reorganization managers . " The principal Mop committee is flanked by three other important committees , offering to protect the holders of some $125,000,000 of bonds . One committee is headed by an officer of the Bankers Trust Company of New York , a bank that rendered services and received fees on many occasions in Missouri Pacific history . It is now , as it was in the 1917 reorganization , trustee for holders of Mop bonds and depositary for a protective committee .

The Bankers Trust Company , by reason of its involvement in large loans to Van Sweringen affiliates , will lose if the attack succeeds . The Bankers Trust Company officer who is chairman of this committee has the assistance of several committee members . One of them is an officer of a large corporation for which Kuhn Loeb have been the bankers these many years , a corporation so close to Kuhn Loeb that for a time their chief counsel became head of the company . A third committee has been formed to protect those third mortgage bonds which stockholders were induced to buy at the time of the previous reorganization .

A fourth committee proposes to protect the holders of the first mortgage bonds of the Gulf Coast Lines . Three of its six members served as members and secretary of the committee that reorganized this railroad in 1915 . One of the three , G. H. Walker , is chairman of this new committee . He is the banker who , while head of the road , helped to arrange the sale to Missouri Pacific that was so severely criticized by members of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Another member of the committee is an officer of the Bankers Trust Company , already mentioned . A fifth sat on the board of Gulf Coast Lines for years , while Missouri Pacific was giving the board its orders . Bondholders of the Missouri Pacific are thus surrounded by protective committeemen whose firms and banks have had many dealings with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond issues , selling to it the stock of other railways , acting as corporate trustee and paying agent for its security holders , and managing its affairs . The duty these men have undertaken , almost as though their obligation to serve the bondholders were a never-ceasing one , is matched by their selection , for the remunerative post of committee depositaries , of the very institutions which protective committees chose half a generation ago , when the road was bankrupt before . These institutions , Guaranty Trust Company , Bankers Trust Company , and Equitable Trust Company ( now merged into the Chase National Bank ) have also been serving the bondholders these many years , in a number of capacities ? as trustees under numerous bond issues , as registrars of the Mop securities , as hankers floating Mop bond issues to the investing public and , through bank officers , as protective committee and reorganization aides . These are some of the high lights of Missouri Pacific history to date . The story of the months to come revolves about three principal problems . The first problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railway during the dozen years which led with doomlike inevitability to its present bankruptcy . If nothing is done , the entire loss will fall on the security holders who had little or no voice in theconduct of the company 's affairs . Will there be an investigation to determine whether something can not he done to make the men in control of those affairs share at least part of the loss ? The second problem relates to the reorganization . Will it be like the previous one , unsound from its inception , and without those controls and safeguards which security holders should have against the men who decide the company 's future after it is reorganized ? Closely related to this problem is the third , that of the quality and ability of the directors and others who will advise and control the Missouri Pacific when it is discharged by the bankruptcy court . What will be done to insure that its guidance will be in hands sufficiently skilled to run a half billion dollar property , and sufficiently intelligent and scrupulous to run it with due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of its security holders ?
