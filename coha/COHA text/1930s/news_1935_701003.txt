Long . But fresh fuel was added to the flame of revolt when , after the surrender , the militiamen Iaid down a gas barrage against a throng of un ? armed men , women and children , sympathizers with the Square Dealers . The bystanders had pressed close to the ranks of the khaki-clad soldiers , when suddenly sonde one pointed to a short , - stout - roan. zirAd shouted : " There he is ! That 's the spy ! " Apparently believing that he was the informant who had tipped off Senator Long that the Square Dealers were marshaliing their forces , the crowd surged forward angrily . Their quarry was beaten , knocked down , and trampled despite strenuous efforts to save him by the guardsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs . This soon dispersed the crowd . Fight Threatened at First . Earlier , crouching behind a line of thirty automobiles near the woods at one side of the parish airport here , the citizens ' army had seemed determined to fight as the first militiamen arrived from this city , which Senator Long 's henchman , Governor 0 . K. Allen , had placed under martial law earlier in the day . Machine-gun squads of the militiamen crawled forward cautiously on their stomachs across the 500 yards of open space of the airport . The line of the citizens ' array held firm and the guardsmen hesitated until further reinforcements arrived . Then their opponents , who were under the command of Ernest Bourgeois , president of the Square Deal Association , realized that resistance was hopeless . One by one they began to surrender to Colonel E. P. Roy , who was in command of the troops . As the Square Deal line began to break up , a single shot was heard , and George N. Alessi of Independence , La. , forty miles from here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dealer , did n't know who shot him , but his wound was caused by buckshot , apparently from the accidental discharge of the weapon of one of his comrades . No further casualties developed , however , as the Square Dealers reluctantly went forward to the centre of the airport and handed over their arms to the khaki-clad guardsmen . Colonel Roy and his men took their names and addresses and informed them that they were under technical arrest , but then released them . Arrest of Forty Beported .

" The near-battle was the climax of the most turbulent day this city has seen in many years , with Senator Long , surrounded by an armed bodyguard of twenty-five , charging at a so-called " judicial inquiry " in the State House that four Sheriffs , a District Attorney and possibly a district judge had plotted to murder him , and that the revolt against his dictatorship was instigated by the Standard Oil Company . Establishing a court in an unoccupied room on the fourth floor of the skyscraper State House , with Judge J. D. Womack , whom he had appointed recently to the East Baton Rouge District court , on the bench , I the red-faced and fighting mad foe of President Roosevelt shouted into a ladle microphone his allegations that the conspirators planned to kill him last Thursday night . " It was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he yelled . " Thereupon the assemblage arranged to have the automobile in which I was riding blocked somewhere near ' Dead Man 's Curve , ' at which time cars would roll up and the gentlemen who were at the plot meeting would begin their work of murdering me or others in the cars . " Among those in the plot were District Attorney John Fred Odom of East Baton Rouge Parish , the Sheriffs of Iberville and West Feliciana , a deputy sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish , the chief agent of the Standard Oil Company , and the office manager of a Congressman serving this district . " Senator Long was not very specific in his bellowing harangue as to the part each of the men he accused was supposed to have played in the conspiracy , but he used the names of Robert L. Pettit , Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish ; Henry Sherburne , Sheriff of Iberville Parish ; Sidney C. Dubroca , Sheriff of West Baton Rouge Parish , and Fred C. Wilcox , Sheriff of West Feliciana Parish . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leblanc , Assistant District Attorney ; John Appel and Dallas Gross , local Federal employes ; Fred O'Rourke Jr. , whom Long called the representative of the Standard Oil Company , and Fred C. Parker Jr. , a Deputy Sheriff , to whom has been refused a commission by the Senator 's Bureau of Criminal Investigation . Testifies About Plot . Sidney Songy , a former Federal prohibition official , was the principal witness called by the Senator to back up his charges . Songy swore that a gun , gas bombs and ammunition had been given to him with which to kill the Senator . Under prompting from Mr. Long , the witness said that O'Rourke had given him a pistol and that Parker had supplied him with gun shells and bombs . " Where did you get the sixshooter ? " Senator Long asked . " From Mr. O'Rourke , " the witness replied . " He 's the Standard Oil man ? " " Yes . I gave him my smaller gun for his .45 . " Songy testified . " What was the object of the ex-change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bigger gun . " " The purpose was to kill Huey Long ? " the Senator asked , " Yes , " Songy replied . He said that at Parker 's instigation he had attended a meeting in the home of Gross , at which Sheriffs Sherburne and Dubroca were present . He was told , he said , to find out whether Senator Long had any machine guns in his hotel suite here . Songy said that State Senator James A. Noe and a stenographer listened over extensions to a telephone conversation he had with Parker , in which they discussed their plans . Later he was picked up by the police , but he was taken to O'Rourke 's home , he said , and " congratulated " for keeping his mouth shut . He said District Attorney Odom advised him to go back to the police station and wait " until we free you . " Prompt denials came from some of those named by the " Kingfish " as members of the conspiracy against him . Sheriff Dubroca said that " there is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a deliberate falsifier . " Sheriff Sherburne , at Plaquemine , said : " Songy is a man without character and few , if any , would believe his statement under oath . There is not a word of truth in what he said at Long 's hearing concerning myself . " District Attorney Odom added his voice to the chorus of denials , calling the charges " absurd , ridiculous and untrue . " Senator Long announced he had been unable to locate six " conspirator witnsses " for whom subpoenas had been issued . It was " mysterious , " he shouted , that persons of their prominence could not be located . He did question Powers Higginbotham , superintendent of Public Parks and Streets , who replied that he could not remember where he was on the nights of the alleged plotting . He was then released and the hearing was adjourned until Feb. 1 , Guards Surround Long . Surrounded by his customary bodyguard of twenty-five men , Senator Long left here by motor late this afternoon for New Orleans . He announced he intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to go by plane . He said he would be back here to resume the proceedings next week , however . The 300 armed citizens who had taken possession of the East Baton Rouge parish court house last night were aroused by reports that " at least eighty " of their number were to be indicted on the basis of testimony to be furnished by Songy , but they decided to disband after they had been informed that he had been released by the police . When Senator Long heard of the seizure of the court house he instructed Governor Allen to send a detachment of the National Guard to Baton Rouge to oust the invaders under semi-martial law . Thee the senator in persons red hot with anger at the defiance of his authority , hastened to the capitol from New Orleans , reaching there soon after the arrival of the troops at daybreak . The Guardsmen took up headquarters in the pentagon buildings built 100 years ago as a United States Army post , and not far from the thirty-three-story , $5,000,000 Capitol building erected by Long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , with only an occasional militiaman appearing on the streets , but there was an air of tenseness about the fourth floor of the Capitol , where Senator Long had announced the hearing would be held . Each person entering the room was thoroughly searched . Governor Allen 's proclamation declaring martial law and summoning the militia here said that " a situation of armed insurrection against the duly elected and appointed of ficials has broken out . " It also asserted that the Standard Oil Company had " declined to do anything to prevent the same . " Senator Long also blamed the oil company for the trouble , and warned that his " compromise " with it over the 5 cents a barrel refining tax was off unless the company " stopped its violence damned quick . " " To my certain knowledge for twenty years there has been physical fear in Baton Rouge largely instigated by the Standard Oil Company , " be continued . " It has controlled and influenced legislation , and often prevented it altogether . " Demonstrations of hundreds of armed men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is over . Law and order have been substituted for violence by the Standard Oil Company . " The Standard Oil Company has signed at least twenty compromises ' and followed each with an attempt at violence . The compromise is at an end . nless the Standard Oil wants to insist on it . " Their violence this time might be exerted to enforce the compromise ? instead of tearing it up , like they have been doing . They 'll have to ' show good faith mighty damn quick , the opportunity for which will be mighty soon . " " If they want a fight , they 'll get one , " declared the Senator . Then , soon after Governor Allen 's declaration of full martial law , eight militiamen raided the offices of the Square Deal Association . They said they were searching for ammunition , but when they found only a woman stenographer they departed . A general order was issued by Brig . Gen.
