txt New revenues for relief amounting to $30,000,000 a year are providedl for In a three-point program tentatively approved yesterday by the local laws committee of the Board of Aldermen , which met at City Hall . The program contemplates the following : Increasing the present 1 per cent tax on public utilities to 3 per cent , to yield $15,000,000 . Placing a city tax on bond sales of 60 cents on each thousand-dollar bond , to yield $5,000,000 . A city tax on inheritance above $2,000 , to yield $10,000,000 . Alderman Richard J. Tonry proposed a city tax on the surplus and undivided dividends of savings banks , to yield $5,000,000 a year . The legality of this tat was questioned by those who recalled that the city 's agreement with its bankers carried a prohibition against taxing savings banks . When the city proposed last year to tax savings banks and life insurance companies the bankers made an arrangementwhereby they lent the city $70,000,000 for relief , on the express understanding that savings banks would not be taxed . Three Baum Measures . Alderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other tax measures . He estimated that the city 's relief needs for a year would run to $45 , - 000,000 . The public utilities tax , at the rate of 114 per cent , is included in the 1935 budget , to yield $7,500 , - 000 . Alderman Baum proposed to take it out of the budget and double the rate , devoting the $15,000,000 proceeds exclusively to relief . The budget is now about $5,000,000 out of balance , according to Controller Joseph D. . Alderman Baum and his colleagues believe that this amount can easily be made up by charging license fees to various groups for city services . The aldermanic committee on licensing is considering about ten such additional charges , and expects to make its report in a month . None of the imposts will be heavy , it was said , but the total revenue raised by them will more than meet the budget deficit . With the budget balanced there remains only the task of providing relief revenues . The program con-1 sidered yesterday falls short of the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . With $30,000,000 in new revenues assured , however , the Aldermen believe the bankers would not hesitate to advance relief loans , using the new taxes as their security . Federal Bond Tax Now . Alderman Baum said that Mayor LaGuardia , as a member of Congress in 1931 , introduced a bill providing for a tax of $1.20 on each $1,000 worth of bonds transferred . He said this rate was reduced to 40 cents a thousand in the Senate , and incorporated into the Emergency Revenue Act of 1931 . With a city tax of 60 cents a thousand addeg , he said the total tax on a $1,000 bond transfer would be one dollar . He made clear that government and municipal bonds would be exempt from the tax , which would fall chiefly upon railroads , large industries , foreign governments and utilities . Questioned about the probability of a rate increase by public utilities , in consequence of the increased city tax , Alderman Baum said the Public Service Commission would protect the public against any increases . The city inheritance tax would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate about ? half the amount the State receives . The tax would apply only to inheritances above $2,000 and would be graduated upward . Mr. Baum said that each county in Ohio received a rebate from the State inheritance tax amounting to half of the amount collected in the county . He said the effect of his measure would be either to increase the State inheritance tax with a proportionate refund to the city , or the establishment of a separate city levy on inheritances . For the last ten years the amount collected in New York City on the State inheritance tax has averaged $16,000,000 a year , Alderman Baum said . Since the bulk of the tax collected came from the city , he contended that the city should receive most of the income . Holds Measures Legal . " There is no question of the legality of any of these three measures , " the Alderman said . " All three may - be enacted locally without the need of our obtaining permission from the Legislature . Under the Ross bill the city is empowered to levy taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under that law . " Mayor LaGuardia will receive the proposed tax program today at a joint meeting of the Board of Estimate and the Board of Aldermen . The aldermanic committee is scheduled to meet again on Monday , when it will receive a draft of the Inheritance Tax bill from Alderman Baum . Members of the committee expressed the hope that the entire program would be - passed within two weeks . Before deciding upon the threepoint program the aldermanic committee considered many other tax proposals . It stood flatly against the two-cent transit tax , and rejected the proposed building-occupancy tax on the ground that it would constitute additional taxation of real estate , in violation of the bankers ' agreement . Democratic members of the committee evinced a strong desire to get the relief financing problem settled without delay . They were motivated largely by the fact that ' Frank J. Taylor , the new Democratic Controller , will take office on Jan. 1 . Since it would be to Mr. Taylor 's advantage to take over the city 's finances in balanced condition , the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry W. Laidler of the Citizens Conference on Unemployment sent a list of suggested taxes to the Aldermen yesterday , saying that they would raise a minimum of $72,000 , - 000 yearly . He repeated his recommendation for a business tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent , an additional 41/2 per cent utilities tax , a corporation net income tax and an additional tax upon commercial banks . In a letter to Mayor LaGuardia the Classroom Teacher Groups urged that the bankers ' agreement be scrapped and that the $25,000 , - 000 set aside in the 1935 budget as a tax delinquency reserve be devoted to relief . The organization also urged a suspension of amortization payments on the city debt , for which $180,000,000 is provided in the next budget .
