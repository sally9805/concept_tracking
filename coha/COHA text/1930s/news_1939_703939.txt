txt This is one of Europe 's loveliest Springs . " From a blue , impartial sky , " as Anne O'Hare McCormick writes in THE TIMES Magazine today , " sunshine of a warmth and brilliance rarely seen in April pours down on the just and unjust alike . " The grass is tenderly green in Hyde Park and daffodils " foam like yellow surf along the edges of the Serpentine . " In the Bois de Boulogne the magnolias are in bloom , and Parisians sip their wine and nibble their croissants in the fragrant open air . The tulip beds of the Tiergarten are a lovely sight , and in the Villa Borghese " happy children play in the golden air . " Will these pleasant pictures be remembered as many millions of the middle-aged remember the Spring of 1914 ? The old Europe was to begin dying before the leaves that unfolded that April turned brown . There were many innocent , happy things that would not come again . Lovers walk now in city parks and along country roads . Mothers watch their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl children still too young to be wives , or widows . Old people do not ask much . A warm place in the sun will answer for a while . But a shadow crosses the sun . Will these pictures , in the light of future Autumns and Winters , take on the unutterable sadness of lost joys that can not be recaptured ? This is a practical question , not a sentimental one . The human pilgrimage on this earth is , at best , not easy . But it has its moments , and the key to most of those moments is the lasting quality , the known return , of very simple things . Young people fall in love , marry , have children , plan for the future . They grow old and die and the children carry on their hopes . If Europe could be honestly polled today , without regard to national boundaries , can any one doubt that the vote would be that these simple things should not be interrupted by war ? If national policies went by the results of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice between war , on one side , and security and self-respect on the other , for there would be no aggressor nations . It is true that some governments are aggressive . Others are not . Some nations are being brutally disciplined . Some are still free . But in any country does a mother wish to , however great his sense of adventure , desire to be shot , bayoneted , or blown to rags ? When people believe a great cause to be at stake they will endure these things . But in a world of free opinion and complete information no great cause , needing to be settled by mass slaughter , would be at stake . Democracies have made wars  --  unjust wars , sometimes . But it is not to be believed that free men , in a free society , will deliberately destroy that society  --  which is what a general war now is likely to do . The children play happily , lovers go arm in arm , old people dream of the past in the soothing warmth of the April sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vote , in a free election , to roll out the artillery and send the bombing planes up ? The world 's danger in this harrowingly beautiful Spring lies in the suppression of men 's yearnings , the per- version of their desires . If everything were known , if every one had a voice , there would be no war .
