LONDON  --  Metal dealers were not surprised by the recent reaction in copper and , following further heavy speculative liquidation , consider a further decline in the price likely . After liquidation has been completed the upward movement Is expected to be resumed . It was felt the recent consistent rise in the price of both copper and spelter undoubtedly was due very largely to heavy speculative buying which also had a tendency to cause consumers to buy more than they would have done otherwise . Consumers , therefore , are now being well stocked and demand is still good , although relatively small speculators are taking profits , with the corresponding result that consumers in the meantime are less anxious to make purchases . The reaction is technical and in no way indicating any real reduction in demand for these metals . Metal dealers believe that the copper price is likely to recover , and resume the upward movement as current speculative accounts become smaller . Over 50% of the business during certain days of the upward movement was speculative .
