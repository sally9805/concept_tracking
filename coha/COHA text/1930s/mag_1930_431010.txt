WEALTHY man , with plenty of funds at his disposal and an estate large enough so that his house is seen alone and not in close association with neighbors ' residences , has a wide choice when it comes to deciding upon the style in which his house is to be built . He is not seriously limited by considerations of economy in space , plan , design , or materials , and in making up his mind he can range over the whole field of domestic architecture . But the average man has no such freedom . In the first place , he is almost always limited by the amount he can afford to spend on his house . Then he is limited by the possibilities of his lot , which is small and surrounded by neighbors . It is his architect 's duty to study his needs with these things in mind , and choose for him a house which harmonizes with his individual preferences , and is comfortable , livable , and pleasing to the eye . When a prospective owner comes to an architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally comes armed with pictures and clippings of houses he admires . This is an excellent idea , for it helps the architect to form an impression of the general style characteristics desired . He can tell at a If you like a low , sweeping gambrel roof and an air of cosiness , you will live happily in a Dutch Colonial house such as Mr. Baum designs glance whether the client prefers a formal or an informal treatment , what materials he likes , and what traditional styles have the most appeal for him . Sometimes , however , these first conferences reveal the fact that , outside of certain desirable conveniences , the client has little idea of the salient characteristics of any style . He leaves all that to his architect . In other cases the client may insist upon conflicting features belonging to dissimilar styles , and the problem then is to find out what he really wants . If you are about to build a house and have got thus far in your plans , I hope you will at this juncture be frank with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes people name a figure and then keep going up a bit from time to time as the plans progress , as if they were at an auction . This policy never results in as good a house as complete honesty would create . The amount you can afford to spend has a good deal to do with the style in which your house is built . The least expensive types are those built on a rectangular plan with no waste space on either floor . The most expensive types are the rambling houses ,  | such as the English or the French cottage with high-pitched roofs and a great deal of wall . It is fortunate that the most economical house to build is also one that has developed in this country and is therefore most suitable in many sections from the point of view of tradition . The various kinds of Colonial architecture were determined by the lives of the settlers , conditions of the climate , and the materials at hand . Until after 1725 , the Colonists had to rely entirely upon their own resources and owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were civilized people , bringing education , established customs , ideals , and traditions to a primitive land . They developed these in various ways , sifting out what they needed for their new methods of life , and they attacked the problem of homebuilding in the same way . Land had to be cleared , so it was natural that lumber would be used for building as well as for fuel . Thus a raoe of carpenters sprang up to take the place of the masons they had relied on in Europe . Shingles replaced slate and tile for roofs . Houses were planned to economize on space and labor , and thus were developed the familiar early styles which with small modifications are so practical today . Even when families became wealthy , and imported ' designs for elaborate doorways , cornices , mantelpieces , and stairways ? and frequently the actual pieces themselves ? their houses usually retained their light wooden character and simple expression of the manner of living . In the South , since brick was cheap and abundant , it was used instead of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give so much charm and dignity to old Southern mansions . In other sections stucco came into vogue , and native stone was used . Some houses near quarries were even built of marble . In plan the typical Colonial house had a small central hall from which the staircase ascended . On one side of the hall was the drawing-room and on the other the library or dining-room . The exterior with a central doorway and windows symmetrically arranged , directly expressed the plan . This simple plan , which made economical use of roof and walls , is still well adapted to the needs of the average family ; and since there is such variety in the Colonial types , from the informal Dutch farmhouse to the dignified Georgian mansion , almost everybody can find a design in this tradition which will please him . The relation of the house to the site is an important consideration in choosing the style . For a hilly site , a cottage of the English or French Provincial is often successful . Sometimes an informal Colonial farmhouse fits snugly on a hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best on a flat site . The people of Florida and California have wisely turned to the Mediterranean for inspiration in house design . Spain , Southern France , and Italy , having the same brilliant sunshine and nearness to the sea , contribute the styles now referred to as " Mediterranean types , " which look so much at home in these states . English houses , on the other hand , do not belong to the southern sections of either Florida or California . The sense of environment is being more and more considered in choosing a style . Traditional Colonial houses are built in the eastern part of the country , as well as others borrowed from northern Europe . In the Middle West , the level distances of the wide prairies have inevitably impressed themselves , and there has always been a tendency in the best architecture in that section to long , low lines . So far this tendency has not resulted in a strikingly individual design , but it has given to the best work a local flavor that is very pleasing . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean styles are favored in southern California , but in the northwest , wood is the  | natural material , and architects have used the ranch houses of the pioneers in designing dwellings with a distinct local atmosphere . Occasionally there is conflict between the desires of the home-builder and the types of houses already in the neighborhood . If there is a strong tradition in favor of one style , as in the older towns of New England , it should be respected . But sometimes a compromise can be effected that will satisfy the individual preferences of the owner , and at the same time harmonize well with the adjoining dwellings . A woman once asked me to design a Colonial house for her . She had already selected her site ? a lot in a fine residential section , but long empty because it was some feet below the street . Next door was a Colonial house . I studied the lot and found it entirely unsuited to Colonial , but a visit to her home suggested the solution . Her furniture was old Italian , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I built her an Italian house with a sunken garden in front , to make a virtue of the disadvantage of the lot . It harmonizes nicely with its next-door neighbor , and it fits the owner and her possessions much better than a Colonial house would . From what had already been said , you will readily understand that there is a close connection between the style and the material chosen . As a rule , wood is the most economical material . Stucco on wood frame , " backplastered , " and brick veneer are somewhat more expensive , while stucco on tile , solid brick , and stone are the most costly materials . Occasionally one meets a client who has no feeling whatever for the proper use of materials . I heard not long ago of a wealthy woman who asked her architect to copy for her new house on the Southern coast an Italian marble palace , and she wanted it copied in wood . Her architect of course refused to do it . Wood lends itself readily to Colonial designs and to the characteristic types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English types , or the houses of southern Europe with their tile roofs and iron balconies . Brick suggests charming English cottages , Colonial houses , and whitewashed French cottages . One of the most necessary steps in developing the design of the house is to learn how the owners live , because the exterior must express the plan of the house , and the plan depends on how the people who live in it like to spend their time . People who like to entertain lavishly and formally will probably be happier in a rather formal house . Those who dislike lowceiled rooms and bedrooms cut off by a steep roof will not care to live in the cunning cottage they like so well in pictures . On the other hand , people who live informally and who like cosiness and picturesqueness in a house will be most content if their house is of this type . The small house develops naturally from all the various factors mentioned ? the cost , the materials used , the contour , size , and location of the site , the architectural traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a study of the owner 's tastes and manner of living ; and if each angle of the problem is thoughtfully studied by the architect with the frank co-operation of his client , the result is bound to be a happy one .  |
