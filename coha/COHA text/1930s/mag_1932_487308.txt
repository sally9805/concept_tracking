THE Washington hunger march , though it produced no sensational results , was nevertheless significant as another example of the growing use in America of the hunger march as a vehicle for mass protest . It was no sporadic spectacle . To be understood it must be viewed in relation to two other demonstrations  --  the march on Washington last spring of the bonus army , composed of the homeless and uprooted , and the recent Farmers ' National Relief Conference , which was the culmination of riots , evictions , mortgages , and starvation . Both were essentially hunger marches . Of the three groups the bonus army was the largest , numbering 45,000 at its peak . It was also the least organized and politically the least aware . Perhaps one of the major reasons for this is that most of the veterans were caught up in the amorphous , floating population of d  --  class ? workers . Economically unconnected and having no impetus toward collective protest except recurrent joblessness and social spleen , their understanding of the forces that had deracinated them was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite hunger and taxes which have reduced many of them to serfdom , still have their roots in the soil . As producers they are fully conscious of their position in relation to non-producers  --  the bankers and the middlemen . As a result , they have come to realize the interdependence of the farmer and the city worker . At the farmers ' conference in Washington the repeated slogan was that if the farmer and the city worker do not stand and fight together , they will starve together . Taken as a whole , these organized units of unemployed , including steel workers , miners , farmers , the war veterans , and city proletarians , are rapidly developing the political art of permanent and cyclical mass protest . Following close in the wake of the three thousand hunger marchers who descended on Washington in the first week of December and who promise to return in greatly increased numbers this spring , came the farmers . The leaders of the farmers ' conference demanded a half-billion dollars for immediate relief . If they gain this objective , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is n't equal to a raindrop off a waterspout , " they will come back with other demands . And now a new bonus army , which has risen out of the dust of the militia that evicted them with gas and bayonets last July , is straggling back to the capital . No realistic appraisal of the Washington hunger march is possible without some picture of its organization and at least a brief mention of strategy and police tactics . Each of the three thousand men and women was directly delegated to represent from one to two hundred jobless , underfed Americans who could not come themselves , either because of their families or because they no longer had the physical stamina for a cross-country Huck-march . With dimes , nickels , and quarters . those vi ho sta ) ed at home had created an authonted delegation to go to Vlia.lungton to demand unemplmment in , urance , a cash paunenr of $50 for winter relief , and $10 additional for each dependent . Cumulative evidence from the very outset seems to point to official sanction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable result of what appeared to be a tacit agreement between the authorities and the police . In Wilmington , Delaware , men and women were indiscriminately clubbed and beaten because they had attempted to assemble and speak ; they were , besides , tear-gassed inside the church which they had rented . Moreover , all along the line repeated attempts were made to discourage and dispirit the marchers . Difficulties were raised so that they could not obtain sleeping quarters , hold demonstrations , or even communicate with hundreds of thousands of other hungry Americans . Having failed to split up the marchers and to turn them back , the authorities then proceeded to terrorize them . Accordingly , on Sunday , December 4 , the hunger marchers were met in Washington by a large police escort and shunted into an isolated street , which was immediately sealed by heavy cordons of police at both ends . Twelve hundred policemen , seven hundred deputized firemen equipped with tear gas , sawed-off rifles , and sub-machine-guns , in addition to the militia which was held in readiness in the barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worn , and undernourished men and women . The street in which the marchers were imprisoned for nearly three days lies between a railroad yard and a treeless hill on the outskirts of town . The yard , glutted with empty Pullman cars that could have housed from ten to fifteen thousand homeless people , was covered by plain-clothes men to cut off any escape that way . On top of the hill were machine-guns , which at first , and to an unprepared observer , looked like a battery of cameras . The tear-gas squad was stationed on the bluff . The photographer from the Washington Herald , who was standing on the roof of a truck , was carrying a gas-mask . One of the officers of the tear-gas squad said to a reporter : " The trouble with the Ford job was that they only had $1,000 worth of gas . " He went on to explain that $10,000 had been spent on gas for the present " hunger marchers ' job . " Four trucks were filled with it . In each policeman 's kit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or D. N. gas . On Sunday the marchers were held virtually incomunicado . Besides , there was no water , no hydrant on the street . Not until evening was a truck permitted to leave to bring back cans of water . Many of the men and women went to bed without it . On December 5 , while Congress on the floor of the House was arguing for and against beer , there was not enough water to drink and none to wash with in the hunger camp . There were no sanitary arrangements either , and the men and women were harassed and chased from one place to another by jeering policemen . The second day the marchers were given permission to build a toilet . Four different times the men had gone ahead with this , in each instance hazing received the approval of the police inspector , and each time the police doctor had informed them that they v. ( ) old have to construct it elsewhere in order to comply with sanitary regulations ! In the face of this , and notwithstanding the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law and medicine . the marchers maintained unbroken discipline and order . They carefully refrained from offering the police the slightest provocation . There were no cots or beds in the camp . Although " sympathizers , " among whom were Quakers , radicals , workingmen , and humanitarian citizens of Washington , had offered accommodations sufficient to house a thousand hunger delegates , the police would not release them for the night . Some slept in the trucks . Others , ill with fever and exposure , old and young , men and women , fatigued and with nothing in their stomachs but a cup of coffee and a sandwich , lay down on the cold asphalt . For pillows they used ragged bundles or shoes . Sick men and women could not get hospital attention without the approval of the police doctor . When a feverish marcher was taken out , it was feet first . As one was being carried out to the ambulance , a policeman said : " Well , I guess it would be inhuman to let him die ! " At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determination which one officer expressed when he said : " Let him die here . We do n't want him to die in Washington . " It would not do to allow a hungry American to die of starvation on the streets of the capital . The hunger marchers were political prisoners and were accorded the treatment meted out to criminals , with the difference that even in the most backward jails convicts are at least provided with food and water . The next day the hunger camp hummed with camera men , detectives , reporters , stool pigeons . The citizens of Washington were still sanctimoniously isolated from the marchers . In accordance with this policy , Major Brown , the Police Commissioner , who wanted to perform his duties with more competence than General Glassford , his predecessor , who had been " too easy " with the B. E. F. , issued a Foch-like pronouncement : " They will not parade . " Congiess had opened its session . Members of the League of Professional Groups and the National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they thought , might evince some interest in the constitutional rights of American citizens . Legal machinery was set in operation by liberals in an attempt to obtain an injunction restraining the police from holding the marchers . The police , having failed to incite the hunger marchers to riot , started a campaign of more pernicious provocations and red-baiting . The tear-gas squad on the hill began to " test " the bombs by throwing them into a bonfire . As the bombs exploded , the wind , which was blowing in the direction of the delegates below , carried the sickening fumes into the trucks where men and women were sitting and standing , causing them much discomfort . Committees of citizens passing back and forth were spat upon and jeered at . Whenever a marcher came near , one policeman would leer at another with " Hello , Comrade . " Doubtless the press played a large role in all this . In order to give their stories a sexy and gamy flavor some papers stated that men and women were sleeping standing up locked in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles declaring that each hunger marcher was receiving five dollars a day from Moscow . Sensation rather than fact was the dominant feature , and the following kind of reporting was typical . A headline ran : " Rumor , Dynamite in Communists ' Trucks . " Below , in small letters , was " Rumor Unfounded . " This must have helped to inflame the police force . As a matter of fact , one police officer said that he knew there was a nest of machine-guns in one of the marchers ' trucks . However , no investigation was ever made . And even when articles , representing the opinions of individual reporters who had actually witnessed the scene , were sympathetic to the hunger marchers , the headlines , expressing the editorial policies of the paper , were more often than not at complete variance with the stories . Toward five that afternoon the marchers fell into ranks . Two columns , each four abreast , extended down the street for more than half a mile . It was a dress rehearsal for the parade the following day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspector took the demonstration for a threat and put in a riot call . A siren rang out over the hill . Motorcycle cops bounded over the bluff , buses of policemen were unloaded . The police with clubs in their hands dared the marchers to cross the line where the rope was stretched across the width of the street . Banners were hoisted by the marchers : " We Demand Shelter for the Homeless , " " We Demand Unemployment Insurance , " " Fight Against Starvation . " The red-front band started to play the " Internationale " as the ranks came nearer and nearer the rope . As the tear-gas squad stood in readiness , bombs poised in their hands , one yelled : " The yellow rats , why do n't they do something ? I 'm rarin ' to go ! " Then , when it seemed as if the bombs were about to descend , a plain-clothes man turned his head the other way saying , " I 'm not going to look at this . " At that moment the writer , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt as if he had been turned over in an automobile accident and had lost consciousness for several seconds . In geometric formation and with the clicking precision of typewriter keys the marchers made a left-squad turn . The police jeered hysterically and the hunger marchers booed . Later , Senator Costigan came out and was indignant at what he saw . La Guardia was there and equally aroused . Congressmen Swing and Amlie visited the camp , among others . Howard Williams of the L. I. P. A. said that if there were no police , there would be no trouble . That night about four hundred men and women were allowed to leave the camp and sleep in lodgings in Washington . The police , many of whom were drunk , broke loose and slashed the tires of seventeen trucks . The permit to parade the next day was granted , but the guard surrounding the marchers was so thick that some of the unsuspecting spectators in the throngs must have thought it was a police and firemen 's parade on the way to a ball and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The crowds neither booed nor cheered . There was in Washington that morning all the semblance and surcharged atmosphere of martial law . The citizens were explosively timorous . Perhaps something of the tense and electric silence with which they watched the hunger marchers may be explained in terms of Mark Twain 's " The Mysterious Stranger , " in which but one man of all those who threw stones at a beautiful witch really had a grudge against her . The others threw stones because each one was afraid that the man standing next to him was antagonistic . It seems that the significance of the hunger match , which must include the bonus army and the farmers ' conference , and its place in the political history of the United States will depend not so much upon the present , tentative reactions of public opinion as upon the kind of organizing and mass maneuvering it may release in the near future . Prognostications will be much more in order by the end of 1933 , the year of our lord Franklin Delano Roosevelt .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
