IN SIGNIFICANT ways , economic pain is like physical pain , and our understanding of it is still very primitive . We refer it to the nearest cause , and this , in the worst ease , is always something we did to ourselves . A dream of new grandeur . Delirious speculation . Inflation of money and debt . And we resolve in the future to restrain ' hat cause . The weakness of this reaction to pain is that we make the resolve without asking ourselves why ; again and again , we reproduce the cause , each time a greater dream , each time a deeper delirium , each time a worse inflation of money and debt , and conceal from ourselves the fact that we are doing it . Why life that is conceived in ecstasy must be born in pain , we do not know . Yet it is so , and thinking of it , we come to the rational conclusion that all we can do about it is to invent means of alleviation . Pain itself we can not abolish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , in the same way the cause of economic pain exists in the design of progress . and progress , for anything we know to the contrary , may be itself a process of life . Whence comes of a sudden to a whole people that tormenting , unexpected vision of a. further radical advance in material well-being ? Cali it wealth , to mean everything : or call it a new extension of their power to transform the environment for the greaterconifurt of greater numbers . Having dreamed such a dream , then why are we bound at any hazard , at any cost , to pursue it toward reality ? Knowing beforehand whut the pain will be  --  first the pain of losing our d rea in possessions , and then the pain ( if terrific exertion to make it all come true  --  knowing and denying it at . the same time , we make the dream last as long as it will , with a dread of waking up . We know all the time we shall have to wake up . Nevertheless , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 lie dream is real . That is the fatal moment . There the dream ends . With the end of the dream the pain begins . When the pain is bait , yet no more than the fear of it was , we forget we are dellwering a dream . Almost we forget Hie dream . What IHIly is dreaming ! Why not have a stable economic world ? Why could n't we have gone on as we were going ? That was not so had . In the throes of change we wish for the heaven of stability ; only . of coil rm. , that it . shall include the benefits of all change before ' this . We debate how in the future and forever to avoid depressions by avoiding the peaks . The way not to have depressions is to forbid the cause of them , m which is the boom . How simple ! What causes the boom but the dream ? Shall we stop ilreamine Shall the enre for depresions be to have no more visions , no more dreams to deliver in pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inseparable from the birth of change . If that is so , then the most we can do about it is first to accept it in an intelligent manner and then to perfect . a science of obstetrics . Either that , or we give up the idea of progress through change . That very troublesome idea is still new in the world , in the historical sense . II a-ppeared first . in Europe only two or three hundred years ago . The ancients had no Con eept ion of it . The superior material power I lie Western world is entirely derived from that one idea . Europe never did embrace it completely . Only this country did that , and that is why we now possess the sign of paramount power iu the Nyliole world . We are founded oni .. ha WI ' . It . is the only security we know ? progressive and dangerous change . Thus our extreme economic volatility is accounted for , why crises and depressions are so frequent in our experience . a ml then why we recover so rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ea eh tine. it is new ; each time we say it . shall Ili'VOr happen again  --  at least , not in the same way . I t never does happen ag , aie in the same way . because the dream wherein change conceives itself is each time a new dream . It is only the pain that is always the same  --  the pain and our reactions to it . Our economic history might be written simply as a. series of dreams and one repetitious experience . The experience is that of falling headlong down the stairway of change iii pursii i t of a dream , and falling each time to a Brea ter heieht . The meaning lies in the contradiction . When our ii ; If ional w.a l I I/ was $6,000,0110 , ess l the had cur ' first had fall . That was the crisis el ' 18 : - 17 . When our national wealth was S15,000,000,000 we had our second bad fall .

Twenty years later , when our national wealth was $70,000.000,000 , another Had fall  --  the crisis 0i 1893 . Our First Big Dream  --  of Western Empire rr HERE was a panie in 1903 , when our national I wealth was $100,000. ono.000 , and another in 1907 , when it was Si . neola ) , 000,0110 , but no grey t crisis again until after the Nvar , in 1920-21 , when our national wealth was S:320,000,000,000 . The recovery in tier f ease was immediate . Thi.h 1929 . In that . car the rude-mat wealth could bear an estimate of S-100,0 ( se000,000 . Never had one people , one country , been so rich , and rich not only in things possessed but in the power to increase human satisfaetions in an endless manner . And never before had we been so persuaded that a dream of the future was the future itself , never so sure that for onee there would be no painful translation to make . We had only to gn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , the reality of it , we had only to buy the red-and-green steel engravings that represented it  --  and there was some anxiety about the engraver 's process lest it should fail to multiply these shares of unwrought participation fast enough or in time to let everybody in . We knew better . We remember now that all the time we knew better ; and we marvel at the resources of imagination , credulity and self-deception by means of which we concealed from ourselves the fact that we were dreaming . And that is not all we were doing . Weakly and in fear of the consequences , we were hiding from ourselves the knowledge we have of a certain necessity that inhabits our idea of progress . Without it that idea would have no meaning whatever . Once we had dreamed the dream of a new era , we were under compulsion , in spite of ourselves , at any cost , to bring that era to pass . There was no escape . knew t he t . It was idle then to deny that necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many of us do , or to say there was nothing in it . And of all our dreams so far , or any installment of I he serial American dream , this one with which we fell in 1929 would be the most diflieult to externalize in reality , because of its magnitude , its complexity and the strangeness of its parts . n Ilie ere oi ional reaction to economie pain , memory of the preceding ecstasy grows very dim . There seems the possibility of utter meaninglessness in everything , ecstasy as well as pain . What are we toward ? Distress in parallel to surplus . Distress because there is surplus  --  a surplus of means and a surplus of things . First no telling what anything is worth because no one can say how much higher the price of it will be tomorrow ; then , two and a half years later , no telling what anything is worth  --  these sane , things  --  because Embody can say how much lower the price may go , down to zero . United States Steel common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common in the same country with the same future at S36 a share in 1931 . Where is any meaning in his ? There was a dream . Come back to that . Never yet have we dreamed a false dream . Never yet has a depression gone wrong , for all our hysterical efforts to make it go wrong . Never yet have we failed in the panic , the dismay and the pain of depression to deliver the dream that ? receded it . What was the dream we fell with in 1837 ? The first glimpse of Western empire , to the ' Mississippi and beyond . The Erie Canal and New York City were competing with the Mississippi River and New Orleans for the future commerce of a world the very boundaries of which were unknown . The Louisiana Purchase had not yet . been explored . Frontier posts like St. Louis and Chicago were imagined to have the destiny of cities . The states call at one time were seized with a mania to build roads and canals with borrowed money . Arteries first . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and issue money as they wished . The speculative possibilities of land were discovered . Town sites and corner lots in the unexampled wilderness . It was our own Mississippi Bub  --  le and it . burst again , as it had burst in Prance more than a hundred years before . for the same reason . Not that the vision was fantastic , except in the sense that it to rned out to be fantastically paltry in contrast withreality , but because it was the vision itself that had been capitalized , because the future belonged not to those who were buying then the gilded image of it with intent to appropriate the reality , but only to such as would come to perform the prodigious labor of bringing the dream future to pass . This very early American experience was characteristic . The model is still true . Therefore it receives more space in reflection than its relative economic importance may deserve . There was ugliness in it , vulgarity of greed , excess of folly , yet none of this will obscure the meaning . Such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trivial excrescences . There was the dream to begin with  --  the dream of Western empire  --  and that it was a dream above any natural necessity is clear from the facts . There was no pressure of population . We had never enough people . Every man who went West was counted an economic loss . American independence had been achieved with no thought of Western empire . Our ways of thinking , our mercantile intentions , our first ambitions , were all coastwise , looking east . In the European tradition we might have made our country within natural geographic boundaries  --  that is to say , east of the Alleghany Mountains , or , at the very most , east . of the Mississippi , as , indeed , for a long time we had been thinking it wise to do . Buying an Empire to Get a City T lIE Louisiana Pu rehase was a strange accident . We were trying to free the mouth of the Mississippi River from foreign control . Ohio settlers could not lift their produce over the Alleghanies to the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making canals to cross mountains ; railroads there were yet to be imagined . So they wanted an outlet to the Gulf by way of the Mississippi , but first Spain and then France controlled the mouth . of the ' Mississippi . Napoleon Bonaparte refused to sell us New Orleans , but on a sudden impulse he offered to sell us the third part . of a. continent , then called Louisiana , extent unknown . The American commissioners who had been sent to Paris to buy New Orleans rashly closed the deal on the spot , and did it with no authority . They were afraid he might change his mind . When they brought their bargain home it was received with ridicule , and only with great . difficulty did President . Jefferson persuade Congress to accept it .. The argument for it was that we gained New Orleans . That was all we wanted . For twenty years we had no idea what we had bought . Then , as the vision began to rise , it produced some very angry prolliems . We now love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him less or not at all . It bitterly resented his cheap Western land coming into competition with the settled agriculture of the East . Eastern agriculture , it was thought , would be ruined ; well , ' a great . deal of it was . Moreover , the frontiersman , bringing his raw states into the Union , one after another , was in all respects an ominous figure . Ile was upsetting an old political ca.ste in the East . Unless he was stopped he would soon be able to seize the balance of power , There was talk of secession and separation . You might have said yourself at the time , as many did say , that the idea of Western empire was preposterous because the elements of it were so diverse , so antagonistic in all senses , political , emotional , economic . Nevertheless , the vision overcame all rational reluctance . It had the power at length to involve people of the East , people of the South and people of the West in one leveling experience . First it lifted them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . The collapse was terrific . All banks with one consent suspended payment . Half the property in what was then the whole country changed hands under the sheriff 's hammer . Nine in ten factories in I he East shut up . New York , says one historian . was like a dead city . In the South , $1500 slaves were sold for $200 because the planters were obliged to sell some in order to feed the others . All public works were abandoned . Land fell to one-fiftieth of its inflated value . Yet for all of this , the national wealth increased nearly threefold in the next , twenty years . The dream was overtaken . In 1857 what was it ? Then a. vision of eontinental empire . We now knew the amazing extent of the Louisiana Purchase . Beyond that we had acquired Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , Utah , Nevada and California .. What a strange thing to have happened to a colonial civility that might have been content . with a destiny east of the , : kileghanies ! To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China or India were more familiar than the new words they were learning for t he Paci fie Coast . Al ready S I 00,000.000 of gold had come around I he Horn to the Philadelphia Mint from California , 15,000 miles by clipper ship . That was the quickest way . Great . areas of the pul domain were still unexplored . Finding was the native adventure . Finding was keeping too . It was a wonder anybody ' , mild keep his head . But enough had already been found to make development a more serious business than discovery . The coal and iron mines of Pennsylvania were opening . Railroads were already going where canals could not go , also where canals did , to the ruin of canal capital . When Only Those Responsible Were Punished V ET this was more like a daydreamin which con- tact with reality may be instantly reestablished . The wildest thing in it was the phantasy of a transcontinental railroad , lint nothing had yet been done about it . The crisis , when it came , was financial purely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflated , speculation committed all its natural follies ; but owing either to rhe musing character of the dream or to memories surviving of what had happened twenty years before , there was this time no uncontrollable mass delusion . Many banks failed , three railroads went into receivership , there were nearly 10,000 failures in general business . The losses were thought prodigious , running into such figures as people had not imagined before , kit they fell upon the offenders , where they belonged . The innocent escaped . There was no very severe depression in the wake of the panic and recovery was soon complete . In the next fifteen years the national wealth was doubled , t he ( =Ivil War notwithstanding . Giving Life to Dreams T HE vision we stepped off into space with in 1873 was the first of its kind . It was a. vision of national power . We had seen the estate as a whole , with intent to art upon it , and it was a world . Only our title to it was real . Our possession of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task was to settle it , tie its magnificent parts toget her with steel bands and equip it . We dreamed of doing this in less than ten generations , in less than one  --  in time to be seen by those then dreaming . Why not. ? The transeentinental railroad that had been a phantasy of daydreaming only twenty years before was already an externalized fact . Until the I Tnio n was built . Nvith Federal aid , the railroads had followed people . Here was a new way . The railroads should go first , to break open I he way ; people would follow the railroads  --  people , agrieulture , towns , eities and t rade . A rid ( Continued on Page 92 ) such was the order of the next advance . Land m-as the great inducement .. The railroads , for going first , received millions of acres from the public domain in all et-nate sections on bah sides of a free right of way . The idea was that homesteaders would take the rest  --  as , of course , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land its first value . Then the homesteaders , working their own , gave that of the railroads a second value . This movement began after the Civil War . It absorbed the disbanded armies . In a little while the whole country was land mad . The railroads sold securities to the public on t he representation that the land grants alone would make them rich  --  and that was 1 rue , if only they could held out . The hard-headed East loaned its money at high rates of interest . to the homesteaders ; Western farm mortgages became the darling investment of New England . In eight years 30,000 miles of pioneer railroad were built . west of the Mississippi . Industry , of course , was enormously stimulated . First . was all this demand for the stuff of which railroads are made , and then the demand for the things with which agriculture must be equipped , including machine implements . Commedities , wages , food , everything whatever , were dear and rising ; nobody could imagine enough of anything . The only cheap thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it credit . Thvn , was , naturally , a tremendous expansion of credit . Then , suddenly , there was of everything too . much , and much more debt than could he paid . Produce from all that newly opened land began to glut the markets of the East ; then those of the world beyond . In the land was the eun tradietion of grea I fertility and no profit . The homesteaders could not pay the interest on their farm mortgages . The railroads could not pay the interest on their bonds . There was a mighty crash of debt . Eighty-nine railroads went into receivership . Railroad building- all at once stopped . Steel rails fell from $120 to S-12 a ton , and 300 steel mills went cold . Insolveney was the normal state of business . Before it was over there were nearly 51I , - 00t1 commercial failures . The number of unemployed was 3,000,000 ; of these , 500,000 had been in railroad construction gangs . Ignoring the Cost of Change For nearly sixty years this stood as the incomparable disaster in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may still appear to have that place . The vertical fall was no greater than the one we have just had , but all the circumstances were more brutal , sonic of them extremely ugly . The time of depression was five years . Both its long duration and its intensity were owing , however , not to the episode of panic , nor to tho losses therein , but obviously to profound economic changes then taking place in this country and in Europe , acting and reacting irresistibly . In any study of crises and depressions , the case of ' 73 is ideal . There all the features are clear . What appears in the vision , to begin with , is not the process of change , only the fact accomplished and the grand result . Then occurs the speculative interpretation , which also is an act of imagination , though of course on a much lower ( Continued from Page 5 ) plane . The weakness of this interpretation is that it leaves ou t. the difficulties , the cost , the destruction that will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . To what is , shall be added what will be . Simply that .. But much of what is will be swept away , including old profit and old capital . There will be profit again  --  more than ever  --  but new profit ; there will be capital again  --  much more than before  --  but new capital . Speculation is defeated by the very change it runs forth to meet . What was , is departing ; the present is fluid and the future has not yet arrived . Afterward the speculator may think his only mistake was to miscalculate the time . That is not it .. He has miscalculated t he cost of change , if ever he considered it at all . Breaking Down the Surplus Dam The changes taking place in the 70 's were such as to destroy a world-wide structure of profit ; also , therefore , a world-wide structure capital , resting upon that profit . New forces were suddenly loose and uncontrollable . All values and relat ions were altered by an anarchy of change . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and distance , altering at the same time the value of commodities , and this not only by reducing the cost of transporting them but by opening new sources of supply . A surplus bushel of wheat in Nebraska was worthless until there was a railroad to haul it out ; then it was marketable at . Liverpool . Wheil the American railroads began to open up the ' Western prairie land , it was like breaking a dam llehind which foodsluff had been piling up for millions of years . Then suddenly there was the Bessemer steel process by which the production of steel could he enormously increased at very low cost , and that again was like breaking a dam . And since everything must happen at once , there was an application of power , invention and labor-saving method to industry on a scale and with a competitive intensity never before imagined . The rate was self-accelerating. owing to competition , or to the neeessity of finding profit again on a lower plane . A producer who hesitated to make over his works was ruined by low-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again and again , and this was vital to the vision . lt never could have fulfilled itself without cheap steel in immense quantities . The pace was so fast that new machinery might become obsolete even while it was being installed . Even the railroads already built had to be made over , with steel ill place of iron , larger locomotives , larger cars , heavier bridges , for bigger and bigger loads , in order to reduce the cost of transportation . The effect of all this upon prices , profits and old capital was simply disastrous . The vision , remember , was not interested at all in what might happen to old profits and old capital , but only in the means for bringing itself to pass . The depression was a necessary condition . Food , commodities , the cost of living , wore progressively cheapened at a rate never before equaled . In the first decade after the panic of 1873 , five years of depression notwithstanding , 51,000 miles of railroad were built ; in the second decade , 58,000 more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the job . The dream was accomplished . And by 1893 the national wealth had much more than doubled again . All states of dreaming are not pleas . ant . There will be nightmare too . When one comes to the 90 's and to what we were thinking of at the time of our bad fall in 1893 , it is difficult to disentangle the elements of nightmare . It was the age of confused wonder . We had . achieved more than we could construe . Destiny had been acting through the human will . The instrumental will of the builders and drivers , all of them dreamers , was necessarily hard and ruthless ; inevitably it would become arrogant and tyrannical . That had happened . We had settled and organized this continental empire . Industrially , we had overtaken the machine age , in which Europe had been ahead of us by half a century . By 1890 we had done all this , though at the cost of frightful social scars , For labor we had opened our gates to a flood of immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration we had known before out of North and West Europe ; and now , stopping suddenly to regard this new and racially alien mass , we were alarmed . Could we assimilate it ? Our very physiognomy would change . This newly imported labor did not mix . It . had ninny tongues and strange traditions .. Strife between capital and labor became lawless on both sides , assuming aspects of private war ; and this was a growing evil . Before the end of the 70 's , John Hay had wondered audibly if we had saved the Union at Appomattox only to lose it in social disintegration . So long as there was a frontier , discontent had its refuge and escape . But by 1890 the fron I ier was gone . We had lost it on the Pacific Coast . Moreover , in the 90 's we were dealing with an alien body of labor , that new immigrant mass , bringing with it a strange word . The proletariat . It would not have known what to do with a frontier . The . firrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social history . It is indexed by such names as Homestead , Haymarket. , Leadville , Cceur d'Alene  --  each connoting a bloody issue of the dispute . The public was a third party , with rising grievances of its own against an invisible power named Special Privilege , and it was the same thing , contemptuous of government and of peoactually say " The public be damned , " ple alike , intolerant of restraint . Whether one of its massive figures did there was no doubt whatever that he thought it . The head of a great railroad did say : " Th.e rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected and cared for not by the labor agitators but by the Christian men to whom God in His wisdom has given control of the property interests of this country . " There was the instrumental will speaking , in a spirit that was about to be overthrown . Nevertheless , it was this will that had laid the foundations and reared the structure . How to save it from itlelf ? That was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with no doctrine of wealth among us . The mind of possessive wealth wa .. s arrogant ; the resentment against d was ominous . There was an idea of wealth to be destroyed ; there was an " - established ' And that was the dream  --  a dream of prosperity . All the rest was nightmare . You may have great wealth without prosperity . We were to fear that . Speculation , for once , did not contain the dream ; it was , in fact , antagonistic . That is , perhaps , why the crash in 1893 was so shattering , with many consequences worse than those from the panic of 1873 . In every case before this the on-coming change was physical ; in this ease it was a change in our ways of thinking and feeling that was to come . The speculation that ended in the panic of 1S93. was an assertion of the right of wealth to project and consolidate itself by will of its own , in the old way of thinking . Its new instrument was the trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint , had got the idea of accountability only to laws of its own . On the other side were such weapons as the Antitrust Act. , which forbade restraint of trade ; the Interstate Commeree Commission , which at last took eontrol of rates out of the hands of the railroads , and so deprived them of their power of life and dea th over communities and unprivileged private enterprise ; and then , at last , the blind weapon of cheap money , which very nearly wrecked the credit of the country , in a spirit that was partly one of revenge . The crash was awful . More t han 200 railroads went bankrupt .. At one time 56,000 miles of railroad and one quarter of all railroad capital were in receivership  --  that is to say , in the hands of creditors . All the banks in New York , Philadelphia. , Baltimore and Pittsburgh suspended cash payment and issued . in lieu of money , their own clearing-house certilieatesmeaning paper to represent assets that could not be liquidated , or , as we now call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a. continuous run upon the United States Treasury for gold , like the gold run recently on the Bank of England that forced Great Britain to leave the gold standard . That was what almost happened to this country after the panic of 1803 ; fear of it caused Europe to call home a great deal of the capital she had been lendinghere , and that , of course , made everything worse . The popular movement for silver , led by Bryan , represented not only a thought of repudiation , not only a demand on the part of debtors for cheap money with which to pay their debts ; it was much more a weapon against the power of willful wealth . There is otherwise no understanding the fanaticism enkindled . Gold was a symbol of that old feudal idea of wealth which was about . to be destroyed . Silver was the avenging ? symbol . Struggling for Prosperity The economic issue was very important , touching deeply the material fortunes of the household ; the emotional issue was dangerous . One was settled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . The other was not settled then . It was only better defined . That dream of prosperity that began in the 90 's , contemplating a deep change in our ways of thinking about wealth and what wealth is for , took nearly twenty years for coming ' , through . The struggle for it and against it grew sometimes very tense , and yet gradually it came to be implicit in the . national common sense that no dispute ' about division should be permitted to nterfere with the work of increasing that which was to be divided . Perfect division with nothing to divide was nobody 's goal . Thus the materials of prosperity went on increasing . There was a panic in 1903 , when our national wealth was 5100,000,000,000 , and another in 1907 , when it was $140 , - 000,000,000 . One was called the Rich Panic . It could be easily explained in purely financial terms . So could the panic of 1907 , which was much more violent , with worse and longer consequences . They are commonly so explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes were otherwise significant .. An order that is passing is entitled to one last grand flame , and this may be so dazzling as to be mistaken for a gift , of new life . Then suddenly it dies . The Worst Fear of Every Panic In 1903 the writing was clear , and that is partly what the panic was about . In 19117 the writing was bold ; so also was the will that defied it .. After P.i07 another railroad Cwsar like larriman was not only improba I de , he was impossible . The power of the people , through government , to regulate . business practices , to regulate business itself when it came to he clothed with public interest , had been established . In twenty years a revolution had occurred in our ways of thinking , and yet the change at last took place almost unawares . In 1913 it was unimaginable t hat the head of a great railroad system should say or think " The public be damned , " or t hat one should be heard asserting the divine right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the Antitrust Act had been construed in the light of reason , so that size alone was no longer illegal . as it was at first , nor power as such , but only behavior obviously contrary to the public interest . Thus a distinction between good trusts and bad trusts ; the had ones alone were bad . For we had realized that modern business could not . be eonducted without . these vast aggregations of ea pita ! . Mass production especially required them . Great changes do often east up their own landmarks in the form of new institutions . In this instance it was the Federal Reserve Bank System , wherein the Government and private finance , eidlaborating , advanced to the position t hat . it was properly their joint responsibility to regulate money and administer credit in the public interest . It was believed then that we had removed , not the cause of panic , but at least the terror of it . For it appeared that in every panic the worst thing of all was the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it was said that with the Federal Reserve System there need never be another panic like ' 73 or ' 93 or 1907 , when the banks ran out of money . Always now , whatever else happened , there would be enough money , because it could expand and contract with need and still be sound . There a time ends . What might . have happened by uninterrupted projection we shall never know . The line breaks . What did happen was the war . Then distortion of agricultural and industrial activity , distortion of values , distortion of money and credit , and , of course , a very grotesque distortion of debt . After the war , two and a half years , there was a collapse , which nearly everyone supposed was the reckoning . It was not . There was no panic . First a cruel fall in prices ; then a sudden contraction in the volume of business , which , if you call it a depression , lasted for less than two years . The recovery was sudden . What followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of exceeding prosperity . It lasted seven years  --  until 1929 ? a season without like in our history , seeming to contain the forethought of all economic solutions . Our national wealth in this period increased in the order of 810i00:14000m4 a year . Our annual national income was more than ten times as great . as the sum of our entire national wealth had been NO years before . And this was followed by a fall beyond measure . The exaggerated factors in the experience are all perfectly familiar  --  namely , inflation , speculation , the reckoning of debt .. So are the principal delusions familiar : First. , that inflation was not inflation ; second , that the pain of deflation may he avoided by more inflation ; and third , that the inflation proposed as a cure for deflation is something else . Such is the standard mechanism of sell-deception . It begins with inflation . Whether it is speculation that pri duces inflation or inflation that produces speculation is an unprofitable controversy . It may he eit her one way or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation is t he disease upon which of her evils fei.d and NI len . The New Technic of Inflation Of old i I was the king alone who could introduce that disease into I he economic body . It was never said the king produced inflation . There was no such word . It was said the king debased the curreney of the realm . lie did it by melting base metal into the gold and silver coin of his subjects , and they were helpless to prevent it , and never knew it . until after they had I leen ' ' heated , because the king eontrolled the mint . Isis motive was that of any inflationist  --  namely , to pay his debts with cheapened money . No regal crime was meaner or ; wire reprobated ; the effect or it upon the king 's people and their country wa , ; always disastrous . at last people understood this , they took control of the mint away from the king , and said : " That evil , theref  --  re , shall never happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing it to themselves  --  only in another way . They did jealously guard the Iveight and fineness of their gold and silver coins and wade adulteration a capital crime , but as the practice of banking evolved they diseovered the use and eonvenience of paper money , and they were always printing lot ) much of it , wiih the same effects as if they ul debased their precious metal money in the king 's men manner . The temptation of popular governments to debase , or , as %ye now say , inflate , the currency by simply printing paper money and setting it afloat , is , umder certain circumstances , irresistible . When people have got themselves into debt they clamor for cheap money  --  that is , debased currency  --  to pay their debts with . In time of war , governments inflate the currency as a. matter of course , and with no better reason than the king had for debasing I he coin of I lie realm . He wanted adulterated money with which to buy soldiers and munitions , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and so he would tell his coiners at the mint to debase the gold or silver coin with cheaper metal . It was cheating simply . A king might be hanged for cheating his subjects ; people can not be changed for cheating themselves through their own government . It took people a long time to learn that if they wished to avoid the evils of inflation they would have to guard as jealously the issue of paper money as they guarded the weight and fineness of their coins . In this country , for example , prior to 1s65 , all the states and thousands of banks issued paper money as they pleased . Then the Federal Government took control of it . But again , no sooner had people learned to toutrol the issue of paper money , or what the consequences would be if they didn't. , than they discovered a third kind of money . This we may call hank money . The cheek you write against your bank deposit to pay the foul bill is neither coin nor currency . Yet it is money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you money on your promissory note or on a mortgage or on securities , he does not hand Out to you any coin or currency . He enters on his books'a credit against which you may draw cheeks . Together you have created bank money . So anything that a bank 11-ill lend credit on  --  personal note , a German hoed , a skyscraper  --  may be converted into hank money . And this hank money , we have just . learned , is or all kinds of money the most potent to produee inflation . Moreover , there is no control of it . During seven years from the middle of 1O2 to ilic beginnIng of panic in 1929 , bank loans increased S1-1,000 , - 000,000 . That was hank money . The increase of bank money  --  the increase alone ! ? was S1 4 .01H ) , 01 H 1,01H 1 , whereas the total amount of United States money  --  coin and paper currenry  --  in circulation all that time was less than s , , 000,000 , onn . And there was the delusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The volume of eoin and currency in circulation did.not increase . Therefore , there was no inflation . To have increased the volume of paper currency nearly threefold in seven years  --  that would have been inflation outrageous . Bank money could be inerea sell in that incredible amount , wit h 1 he same effects as if the paper cu had been increased , and still that was not inflation ! Buying Credit With Credit This bank money was the stuff on which the Wall Street speculation fed , and there was no limit to it , or , at lcast , no limit . was discovered . One reason why there was no limit to it was I hat the Federal Reserve Sy-stem had , indeed , removed from panic one of its terrors . There was never any danger that , the supply of money would fail . In a crisis , and if the time should come when bank money could he inflated no further . then the Federal Reserve System could expand the United States paper currency enough to meet any necessity , provided people had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinch , the Federal Reserve System could expand the paper currency , the banks went on inflating bank money in a manner more reckless than over before . The interesting fact is that never during all that mad speculation in Wall Street did the supply of money fail . What failed at last was human credulity . Nor in the depression until now has the supply of money once failed . Prices failed . Assets failed . Confidence failed . For these reasons thousands of banks have failed because they had nothing of good value left on which to borrow United States money from the Federal Reserve System . But the money was always there for any bank that could bring eligible collateral to pledge for it . In every time of great speculative excitement before this , commodities and securities went skyward together . For once this did not . happen . There was no excessive speculation in commodities . It was all in securities , and bank money was ideal for that purpose . Nearly all of that $14,000,000,000 increase in bank money represented loans on securities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these again were pledged for more credit to buy more securities with , and the higher the stock market went . the more you could borrow and the more you could buy . Inflation to Cure Inflation Then suddenly the reverse . Prices begun to fall . The more they fell the less you could borrow on those same securities , and the less you could borrow the faster they fell , because so many holders were obliged to sell in order to pay back what they had borrowed before . Thus the volume of hank money cont ratted in a sudden , violent manner . That was deflation . Bankers who have been appearing lately before committees in Washington to explain what happened admit . the inflation . admit its disastrous effects , admit that it went much too far . But they say : " What else could we have done with our commodity , which is credit ' Business did not need it . We had either to lend it to speculators or let it lie idle . " Or they say : " The pub-lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and ran away with it .. We merely followed . Inflation was an effect , not a cause . People demanded the credit . " It is true that people demanded the credit , true that they clamored for inflation . When the speculative mania is upon them they demand it because it makes prices go higher and higher . In 1929 , before the crash , the Federal Reserve System tried to cheek the inflation or hank money , and the protest , not only from W:111 Street but from people generally , as a deafening howl . Actually there was an application to the courts for an injunction upon I he Federal Reserve System , forbidding it to interfere . Then again , when the consequences are upon them , people will pray for inflation . The consequences are debt . They want cheap money with which to pay their debts . Always , in a state of deep economic depression , the argument of the debtor becomes dangerously plausible . Historically it is so . He got into debt with inflated money , when prices were high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness , should he be obliged to pay his debts in deflated money , when prices are low and money is dear ? He goes on to say : " A time of depression is the time for inflation ; for inflation , as everybody knows , will cause prices to rise again . As prices rise business will recover . Why cut wages ? Why not inflate money instead ? What , after all , is so sacred about the value of money ? " Everything he says for inflation is true . It will produce these effects . But these are t he effects from which the debtor himself and his creditor and the whole economic body are suffering . He would only repeat them . But for the inflation that was we should not now be in this nightmare of debt . Moreover , debts are not paid with cheap money . Exactly in proportion as money is cheapened , debts are repudi. ated . To this the debtor replies that it is simply a question of expediency . Unless money is cheapened by inflation so that prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It comes to the same thing in the end . Which will the creditor have ? Almost the creditor is persuaded . Almost the Government is persuaded . Almost labor is persuaded , though it knows all the time that to cheapen by inflation the money with which wages are paid is in effect the same as to cut wages . How human and strange ! Credit pools to unfreeze our frozen assets , revolving funds , emergency lending corporations endowed with public funds  --  all such measures of relief look longingly to inflation . Sick from the effects of inflation , we are tempted toward more inflation . Why ? Because to embrace the disease again , we think , would relieve the immediate pain . What becomes of the debts we are in anguish about is relatively unimportant . In a few years we shall have forgotten what became of them , whether they were paid or not . Our debts we owe to one another . Creditor 's loss is debtor 's gain , or vice versa . Not what becomes of the debts as such but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why it would be better for the debtor to default on what he can not pay than again to embrace inflation . even though repudiation of debt by inflation were painless , is perfectly obvious . Default is an act complete . A red mark across the slate . That is why we have bankruptcy courts . But we know by experience that . inflation , once you start , no matter with what good intent , becomes uncontrollable . The appetite for it grows like the craving for a drug . The dose must be progressive . Then a time comes , as in 1929 , when nobody dares to stop it , not even the doctors , not even the Federal Reserve Bank , for fear of throwing the economic body into violent convulsions . A little while longer and the drug will produce the convulsions ; but then we can say the people did it to themselves , and nobody is particularly to blame . fimerica Becomes World  --  Conscious The impulse to inflation in a time or depression may be easily , even sympathetically , understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something we may or may not do as we please , why do we do it when there is no plausible reason for it , and persuade ourselves to believe we are not doing it ? Why did we do it in 1927 and 1928 ? Or , if you hold that inflation is an effect and that speculation is the cause of it. , then why , at that time , did we all at once turn from our work and begin buying stocks to infinity ? According to the thesis , we were dreaming . Also according to the thesis , it was a dream of great change and there wa-s something in it . What was the dream ? It was a dream in two parts . First was a vision of world power ; then the vision of a new era concerning ourselves and our own . And as usual , we left out all the difficulties and all the cost . It seemed that we could manage world power as an American learns to manage an automobile  --  simply by getting in and driving off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived and was present , wher it had been only imagined . Nothing now is easier to do , or more in the mood , than to prove how silly " were about world power . We behaved as if a people who by their own exertions have gained the paramount place are for that reason obliged to all the rest of the world . With a kind of Puritan unease in our prosperity , which was more than that of any other people , we entertained the European view that we ought to share it . Having a great deal of gold , we undertook to distribute it about the world , for the good of the world , and did , in one year , actually expel from this country S500,000,000 of gold , with the idea that other people needed it more than we did . Sending Good Money After Bad We undertook to ease Europe of the cost of her war , and so enormously inflated her debt . We loaned her the money to begin payment of her debt , then money to upbuild her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay , and then the money to pay that money back . Germany was the principal debtor in Europe . It somehow became our responsibility to keep Germany solvent . The more money we loaned in Germany 1he more it . seemed true that her ability to pay was her capacity to borrow . Unless Germany could pay , Europe would be ruined , and we should be ruined because Europe was ruined . Therefore , we had to lend Germany the money to pay reparations . We accepted from Europe the idea that a creditor nation is accountable to its debtors ; that it must . go on and on lending them money , for otherwise they will be unable to pay . None of this made sense . But we argued it in economic terms as if it did . We said at last it was in our own selfish interest . We were ol diged to lend our money in Europe in order that Europe might continue to buy American goods , whereas we ought . to have been saying that if we went on spreading our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense quantities or lose the capital we were lending away . That would make sense , but it . would be a very different picture . And Europe all the time was like Daniel Webster , signing a new note to get rid of an old one , and saying : " Thank fad , that debt . is paid . " Then &; I. ? when Europe , in midyear 1931 , was on the verge of common bankruptcy , from piling debt . upon debt , we said : " Do n't do that . Do n't default . It . will hurt your credit if you do . " And in six weeks we put forth in Europe another 51,500,000,000 of American credit  --  to save Germany , to save the Bank of England , to save the whole of Europe from the disaster of saying she could not pay . But if Europe was bankrupt from having piled new debt upon war debt she could not be saved by piling more debt upon that . The default - mid only be postponed . The cost of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vision left all of that out . It left out the fact , besides , that the sudden shift of paramount power from Europe to the United States was a volcanic up . heaval in the crust of the economic fi ! world . A shift of power from only one nation to another in Europe had his-. torically been attended by war and . - 'devastation . This was a shift from one continent to another . Such a change Was bound to produce a magnificent ' disturbance . ' . ; There stands , nevertheless , the fact of world power . Nor will it disappear . AB in the vision we failed to witness the lost of it , so now , with the change taliand the whole world in a state of confusion about it , we do not very clearly see what it is worth . Who knows what it is worth ? What was it worth to others that they were so anxious to make war for it ? Take it only in the most obvious financial term . Here now is the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was priced in the pound sterling . The pound sterling itself , even in Great Britain , now is priced in dollars . Why ? Because there is no better standard of value . The prestige of the pound sterhng as a universal unit . of value made Great Britain for many years the world 's principal banker , and that business was worth to Great Britain an income of maybe $-100,010,000 a year . The prestige of the American dollar is worth no less to us ; and S400,000,000 a year is easily 10 per cent on all the capital we are likely to lose in Europe . We yet do not know what world power in our hands is for . Perhaps it is better not to think wt ' know . Destiny in that case is perfectly free . We shall make many mistakes . The faster we make them the better . But when it does at length appear what world power in the American hand is for , we shall be amused to remember limy inadequate the exaggerations were in that part of the dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other part What did we think the new era was ? There was perhaps our first glimpse 01 ' what it is all about  --  the distant goal of the machine age , of what we call industrialism . The ugliness of it fell away . Again , all the difficulties were overlooked . What we saw was the progressive cheapening. of 111111 Ian satisfactions until a time should come when all the necessary things of life would he as cheap as water . The means to this end had been discovered and we possessed them . With what we had learned about . mass production and method and with such further advances as might be assumed in technical science , there was , in reason , no limit to the progressive production and distribution of wealth without end . And we thought we had surprised , Ilan , the secret of rhythm . Speeulation had been cast out of business . There had come a new way of re-garding profit , not from the point of view of price but from the point of view of cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to sell increasing quantities  --  therefore , the profit must be found in the margin between that price which necessity fixed and the cost . The cost must be always reducible by bringing better method , more science , more mechanical power to bear upon production . And whereas , before , labor had been treated only as a factor in production , to be hired at the lowest possible wage , henceforth the wage earner was bound to be more and more important as a consumer of the endlessly increasing product . It followed that the producer himself was anxious to sustain wages , even to increase them , for only people with a very high and progressive wage income could consume the increasing product . That being so , the dispute between capital and labor was changed . It became a dispute about statistical quantities and ratios , not a strife over rights . When Capital is Unemployed The speculator 's interpretation of this dream was a sad travesty . He took the forethought of unlimited wealth progressively divided to mean unlimited profits and progressive dividends on common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital profits as capital profits were at that time , whereas if the vision were true , then much of that profit was illusory ; for it was probable , among other things . that our idea of profit would change , as , for example , if capital itself should come to prefer the security of constant employment at a fair rate of hire above the gamble of high profits one year , loss and idleness the next . When we speak of ill-1mph lyment we think only of labor . But the evil of idle labor is but one effect of another , which is the unemployment of capital , tools , equipment , all t 1 ie means of production that represent our accumulations of living labor in the past .. And then wherein the vision was a forethoughtt of stallility , the speeula tor supposed this meant stability or prices ; but it meant , instead , stability of rhythm in the production and uxel et age of wealth . Indeed , the truth or the vision was I he ruin of prices . The change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of ' , reduction was falling , falling faster , perhaps , I han . in any preceding time sieve the 7trs . Moreover , the new era would require not only that . the cost of production should eontinue to fall but that prices should fall in a corresponding manner . Yet prices had not fallen ; and because they had not fallen the speculator cenld not realize that they were bound to fall . He did not see that the benefit of falling cost of product ion would of 1 necessity have ti ) be passed on to the c4insumer , filr otherwise the increasing product of wealth could not 110 consumed . This benefit which had not been passed on to the consumer was what the speculator was trying to seize ; he capitalized it in the valuation of common storks . The inevitable fall in prices , by a. law of necessity , meant , as in 1873 , Iliac again a world-wide structure of profit would fall and that a great deal ( if old capital would have to I ) 4 ' lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Wall Street spel'ul , I Lion had defeated itself more than $5.5. - 000,000,000 had been deleted Nun the value of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange . This is only a measure of the destruction that has occurred . Much of it was false and extravagant capital . A great deal of it . was capital made obsolete by oncoming change . Therefore , so much impedimenta . The sooner it Was lost the better . We could not afford to restore it if we could . The pain of it , yes . But for every advance , from colonial estate to world power in one century and a half , this nation has been so conditioned . Who doubts that we are about to make another advance , that this depression is its necessary preparation , that the new era , even as we dreamed . it , will torment us until it is true , doubts all the history we have .
