txt Spacial Correspondence , The New Yons Timm . LONDON , Dec. ** trend of events in British political life can not be fully understood if the existence and influence of the " radical conscience " in this country is left out of the account . For it is the most potent factor in our politics today , as it has been for generations . The decision to send British troops into the Saar is a typical illustration of its power . What is the radical conscience ? It represents a peculiar British mental attitude , which can prove ascendance in a direct line to the Puritanism of the days of Cromwell , and , if we do not want to go back so far , to the well-known " free church " ideology of the prewar period . In other words , the radical conscience is characterized by an uncompromising attachment to the idea of justice , or rather to what appears to be just to its exponents . It will be seen that in this case the word " radical " does not imply allegiance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not admit of a betrayal of essential principles . It is perfectly correct to say that the adherents of the radical conscience are to be found among all parties . Stanley Baldwin , for example , is one of its most prominent exponents in the same way in which Mr. Maxton is one , though the two men are at the opposed poles of our political life . Forced Saar Action . A month ago it was stated in the House of Commons that the question of r : - ling a single British soldier into the Saar simply could not be considered . Today the same government is dispatching a whole battalion to that territory . People in the inner circle are aware that this change is the result of the pressure of the British radical conscience . At the meeting of the Cabinet Committee the other day , when the telegram from Captain Anthony Eden arrived from Geneva counseling participation in the international police action in the Saar , Ramsay and J. W. Thomas , it is said , were strongly opposed to such a course , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Baldwin knew better . His membership of the radical conscience group  --  a membership which , though not couched in ' any list , is as clear as anything can be  --  made him understand that action in the Saar would be according to the spirit of international justice . He , therefore , backed Captain Eden , and the general support in the British press has shown how right he was in his attitude . For in this country the radical conscience is a good barometer . The British radical conscience is so powerful that in the long run no policy , whether inside or outside the country , can succeed without its approval . This is the reason why British support for the Whites in the Russian revolution collapsed . For it had not the support of the radical conscience . Again for many years after the war it was impossible to get the entente with France on a satisfactorily working basis , because the radical conscience had allowed itself to be persuaded by German propaganda that France was an imperialistic power . Support for Lord Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , that it is Germany which is the menace to democratic freedom , and no propaganda from Berlin can overcome this obstacle . It is said that at the meeting mentioned above Mr. Baldwin , arguing in favor of the dispatch of a force to the Saar , did say that this would please the Davies movement . But what is this movement but the agitation raised by Lord Davies and his friends in the League of Nations Union for the creation of an international police force ? The existence of the radical conscience helps to maintain politics in Great Britain upon a level above purely materialistic considerations . The rot of endless compromise dear to egotistical politicians is stopped again and again by the presence in. some Britishers of a frame of mind which says " Here and no further " when the question of a moral principle arises . The Saar business implies the sending of not more than a battalion on what promises to be a pleasant excursion . Still , it will serve as a precedent for the authorizing perhaps in a not too distant future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of real danger . The practically unanimous support given to the decision in the British press shows that the public is ready to endorse any move of which it understands clearly the motive and the implications . The so-called isolationists , as The London Times appositely says , have managed to isolate only themselves . ? an excellent lesson for the government and for its advisers equally . The radical conscience has functioned in this case exactly as was to be expected . This is highly encouraging in view of the difficult period into which European politics are about to enter . In a few days the Saar plebs . Bette will cease to be a topical prob . lem . Then , unless many of us are mistaken , the essential problem of German armaments will need to be tackled . This can not be avoided , and then the fact that British politics are governmed by something higher than sordid material interest alone will be of an immense value . The moment is nigh when the radical conscience of Britain will be called to play a decisive part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that at this juncture the headship of power in this country is in the keeping of Mr. Baldwin , who is a typical exponent of the principles of the British radical conscience .
