txt Sales by subsidiaries of Drug , Inc. , have turned sharply upward in August and some of the company 's products are now showing good gains over a year ago . Orders now are coming in from retail outlets in sufficient volume to make increases in manufacturing operations probable . All subsidiaries have ben operating plants on a five-day week . There has been a strengthening of the price structure all along the line . with retail prices In particular showing improvement after several years of disastrous price cutting . July retail drug business was in small volume following stimulation in June in anticipation of the federal taxes on June 21 , Aside from the improvement in prices and in volume . the company now has a seasoned business trend in its favor . Normally the second half-year is better than the first . The June quarter is usually the least satisfactory of the four . Therefore , if improvement in general business becomes widespread , Drug should reasonably soon be earning its  --  dividend of $1 a quarter . In the light of the six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is far from surprising that the dividend rate of $1 quarterly was maintained at the recent directors ' meeting . Even allowing for the 11-cent deficit in second-quarter earnings , as compared with dividends paid , there was a surplus of 19 cents a share for the half-year , which meant total addition to surplus of $677,899 . In the four years of its operation in present form ( actually February 1 . 1928 through December 31. 1931 ) Drug Inc. had total earnings of $08,167,002 , and paid out in dividends only 63.6% of this amount , or $43,192,220 . Consequently there were retained earnings of $24,974,782 , the amount outstanding on the books as " earned surplus " on December 31 last , which amount was of course increased by the excess of earnings over dividend requirements of the trot quarter . Thus the company has accumulated considerable " fat " for lean times , and has hardly scratched its surplus by distributing 5380.000 of unearned dividends in the second quarter of this year . On June 30 current assets were $59.930,145. including cash and marketable securities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if net did not show an increase in the current quarter , earnings at the rate of the June quarter would hardly seem to require a speedy reduction in the dividend rate , in view of the treasury , strength .
