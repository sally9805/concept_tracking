What was his dismay and rage , not long ago , to observe beside his picture in the New York American , the picture of a beetle-browed gorilla with fangs like clothespins and nostrils like the mouthpiece of a telephone instrument . <P> The purpose of the picture , he soon discovered , was to illustrate an article on the theory of evolution .

More , it was possible to derive the implication that he , Stanislaus Zbyszko , was no better than a monkey .
