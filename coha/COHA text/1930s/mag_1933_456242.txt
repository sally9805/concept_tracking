GERTRUDE STEIN was born in Allegheny , Pennsylvania . As I am an ardent Californian and as she spent her youth there I have often begged her to be born in California , but she has always remained firmly born in Allegheny , Pennsylvania . She left it when she was six months old and has never seen it again , and now it no longer exists , being all of it Pittsburgh . She used however to delight in being born in Allegheny , Pennsylvania , when during the war , in connection with war work , we used to have papers made out and they always immediately wanted to know one 's birthplace . She used to say if she had been really born in California as I wanted her to have been , she would never have had the pleasure of seeing the various French officials try to write Allegheny , Pennsylvania . When I first knew Gertrude Stein in Paris I was surprised never to see a French book on her table , although there were always plenty of English ones ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read French ? ' I , as well as many other people , asked her . ' No , ' she replied , you see I feel with my eyes and it does not make any difference to me what language I hear ; I do n't hear a language , I hear tones of voice and rhythms ; but with my eyes I see wordsand sentences and there is for me only one language and that is English . One of the things that I have liked all these years is to be surrounded by people who know no English . It has left me more intensely alone with my eyes and my English . I do not know if it would have been possible to have English be so all in all to me otherwise . And they none of them could read a word I wrote , most of them did not even know that I did write . No , I like living with so very many people and being all alone with English and myself . ' One of her chapters in The Making of Americana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She was born in Allegheny , Pennsylvania , of a very respectable middle-class family . She always says that she is very grateful not to have been born of an intellectual family ; she has a horror of what she calls intellectual people . It has always been rather ridiculous that she who is good friends with all the world , and can know them and they can know her , has always been the admired of the precious . But she always says some day they , anybody , will find out that she is of interest to them , she and her writing . And she always consoles herself that the newspapers are always interested . ' They always say , ' she says , that my writing is appalling , but they always quote it , and what is more , they quote it correctly ; and those they say they admire they do not quote . ' This at some of her most bitter moments has been a consolation . My sentences do get under their skin , only they do not know that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Allegheny , Pennsylvania , in a house , a twin house . Her family lived in one and her father 's brother 's family lived in the other one . These two families are the families described in The Making of Americans . They had lived in these houses for about eight years when Gertrude Stein was born . A year before her birth , the two sisters-in-law , who had never gotten along any too well , were no longer on speaking terms . Gertrude Stein 's mother , as she describes her in The Making of Americans , a gentle pleasant little woman with a quick temper , flatly refused to see her sister-in-law again . I do n't know quite what had happened , but something . At any rate the two brothers , who had been very successful business partners , broke up their partnership ; the one brother went to New York , where he and all his family after him became very rich , and the other brother , Gertrude Stein 's family , went to Europe . They first went to Vienna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All she remembers of this is that they used to play in the public gardens and that often the old Kaiser Francis Joseph used to stroll through the gardens , and sometimes a band played the Austrian national hymn , which she liked . She believed for many years that Kaiser was the real name of Francis Joseph , and she never could come to accept the name as belonging to anybody else . They lived in Vienna for three years , the father having in the meanwhile gone back to America on busi ness , and then they moved to Paris . Here Gertrude Stein has more lively memories . She remembers a little school where she and her elder sister stayed , and where there was a little girl in the corner of the school yard and the other little girls told her not to go near her , she scratched . She also remembers the bowl of soup with French bread for breakfast , and she also remembers that they had mutton and spinach for lunch , and , as she was very fond of spinach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spinach with the little girl opposite She also remembers all her three older brothers coming to see them at the school and coming on horseback . The family remained in Paris a year , and then they came back to America . In New York the New York family tried to reconcile Gertrude Stein 's mother to her sister-in-law , but she was obdurate . This story reminds me of Miss Etta Cone , a distant connection of Gertrude Stein . When I first met her in Florence she confided to me that she could forgive but never forget . I added that as for myself I could forget but not forgive . In this case Gertrude Stein 's mother was evidently unable to do either . Gertrude Stein has never ceased to be thankful to her mother for neither forgetting nor forgiving . ' Imagine , ' she has said to me , ' if my mother had forgiven her sister-in-law , and my father had gone into business with my uncle , and we had lived and been brought up in New York ? imagine , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich instead of being reasonably poor , but imagine how horrible to have been brought up in New York . ' After a short stay in Baltimore at the home of her grandfather , they took the train to California . They came by slow stages to San Francisco , and settled down in Oakland . She re- members there the eucalyptus trees , seeming to her so tall and thin and savage , and the animal life very wild . But all this and much more , all the physical life of these days , she has described in the life of the Hersland family in her Making of Americans . The important thing to tell about now is her education . II Her father , having taken his children to Europe so that they might have the benefit of a European education , now insisted that they should forget their French and German so that their . American English would be pure . Gertrude Stein had prattled in German and then in French , but she had never read until she read English . As she says , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened then as always that English was her only language . Her bookish life commenced at this time . She read anything that was printed that came her way , and a great deal came her way . In the house were a few stray novels , a few travel books , her mother 's well-bound gift books ? Wordsworth , Scott , and other poets ? Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , a set of Shakespeare with notes , Burns , Congressional Records , encyclopaedias , et cetera . She read them all , and many times . She and her brothers began to acquire other books . There was also the local free library , and later in San Francisco there were the mercantile and mechanics libraries with their excellent sets of eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century authors . From her eighth year , when she absorbed Shakespeare , to her fifteenth year , when she read Clarissa Harlowe , Fielding , Smollett , at cetera , and used to worry lest in a few years more she would have read everything and there would be nothing unread to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous amount of history . She often laughs and says she is one of the few people of her generation that had read every line of Carlyle 's Frederick and Lecky 's England , besides Charles Grandison and Wordsworth 's longer poems . In fact she was , as she still is , always reading . She reads anything and everything , and even now hates to be disturbed , and above all , however often she has read a book and however foolish the book may be , no one must make fun of it or tell her how it goes on . It is still , as it always was , real to her . The theatre she has always cared for less . She says it goes too fast , the mixture of eye and ear bothers her , and her emotion never keeps pace . Music she only cared for during her adolescence . She finds it difficult to listen to it , it does not hold her attention . All of which , of course , may seem strange , because it has been so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear and to the subconscious . Actually , it is her eyes and mind that are active and important and concerned in choosing . She has never been able or had any desire to indulge in any of the arts . She never knows how a thing is going to look until it is done , in arranging a room , a garden , clothes , or anything else . She can not draw anything . She feels no relation between the object and the piece of paper . When , at the medical school , she was supposed to draw anatomical things she never found out in sketching how a thing was made concave or convex . She remembers when she was very small she was to learn to draw , and was sent to a class . The children were told to take a cup and saucer at hoine and draw them , and the best drawing would have as its reward a stamped leather medal , and the next week the same medal would again be given for the best drawing . Gertrude Stein went home , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer before her and each one explained to her how to draw it . Nothing happened . Finally one of them drew it for her . She took it to the class and won the leather medal . And on the way home , in playing some game , she lost the leather medal . That was the end of the drawing class . Life in California came to its end when Gertrude Stein was about seventeen years old . The last few years had been lonesome ones , and had been passed in an agony of adolescence . After the death of first her mother and then her father , she and her sister and one brother left California for the East . They came to Baltimore and stayed with her mother 's people . There she began to lose her lonesomeness . She has often described to me how strange it was to her , coming from the rather desperate inner life that she had been living for the last few years to the cheerful life of all her aunts and uncles . When later she went to Radcliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever wrote . III And so Gertrude Stein , having been in Baltimore for a winter and having become more humanized and less adolescent and less lonesome , went to Radcliffe . There she had a very good time . She was one of a group of Harvard men and Radcliffe women , and they all lived very closely and very interestingly together . One of them , a young philosopher and mathematician who was doing research work in psychology , left a definite mark on her life . She and he together worked out a series of experiments in automatic writing under the direction of Min sterberg . The result of her own experiments , which Gertrude Stein wrote down and which was printed in the Harvard Psychological Review , was the first writing of hers ever to be printed . It is very interesting to read , because the method of writing to be afterwards developed in Three Lives and The Making of Americans already shows itself . The important person in Gertrude Stein 's Radcliffe life was William James . She was the secretary of the philosophical club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked making sport of question asking , and she liked equally answering them . She liked it all . But the really lasting impression of her Radcliffe life came through . William James . It is rather strange that she was not then at all interested in the work of Henry James , for whom she now has a very great admiration and whom she considers quite definitely as her forerunner , he being the only nineteenth-century writer who , being an American , felt the method of the twentieth century . Gertrude Stein always speaks of America as being now the oldest country in the world , because by the methods of the Civil War and the commercial conceptions that followed it America created the twentieth century , and since all the other countries are now either living or commencing to be living a twentieth-century life , America , having begun the creation of the twentieth century in the sixties of the nineteenth century , is now the oldest country in the world . In the same way she contends that Henry James was the first person in literature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . But , oddly enough , in all of her formative period she did not read him and was not interested in him . But as she often says : ' One is always naturally antagonistic to one 's parents and sym- // pathetic to one 's grandparents . The parents are too close , they hamper you , one must be alone . ' So perhaps that is the reason why only very lately Gertrude Stein reads Henry James . William James delighted her . His personality and his teaching and his way of amusing himself with himself and his students all pleased her . ' Keep your mind open , ' he used to say , and when someone objected , ' But Professor James , this that I say is true , ' James said , ' Yes , it is abjectly true . ' Gertrude Stein never had subconscious reactions , nor was she a successful subject for automatic writing . One of the students in the psychological seminar of which Gertrude Stein , although an undergraduate , was at William James 's particular request a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions to the subconscious . When he read his paper upon the result of his experiments , he began by explaining that one of the subjects gave absolutely no results , and as this much lowered the average and made the conclusion of his experiments false he wished to be allowed to cut this record out . ' Whose record is it ? ' said James . ' Miss Stein 's , ' said the student . said James , ' if Miss Stein gave no response I should say that it was as normal not to give a response as to give one , and decidedly the result must not be cut out . ' It was a very lovely spring day , Gertrude Stein had been going to the opera every night , and going also to the opera in the afternoon , and had been otherwise engrossed , and it was the period of the final examinations , and there was the examination in William James 's course . She sat down with the examination paper before her and she just could not . ' Dear Professor James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am so sorry , but really I do not feel a bit like an examination paper in philosophy to-day , ' and left . The next day she had a postal card from William James , saying , ' Dear Miss Stein , I understand perfectly how you feel . I often feel like that myself . ' And he gave her work the highest mark in his course . When Gertrude Stein was finishing her last year at Radcliffe , William James one day asked her what she was going to do . She said she had no idea . ' Well , ' he said , ' it should be either philosophy or psychology . Now for philosophy you have to have higher mathematics , and I do n't gather that that has ever interested you . Now for psychology you must have a medical education ; a medical education opens all doors , as Oliver Wendell Holmes told me , and as I tell you . ' Gertrude Stein had been interested in both biology and chemistry , and so medical school presented no difficulties ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed more than half of her entrance examinations for Radcliffe , having never intended to take a degree . However , with considerable struggle and enough tutoring that was accomplished , and Gertrude Stein entered Johns Hopkins Medical School . Some years after , when Gertrude Stein and her brother were just beginning knowing Matisse and Picasso , William James came to Paris and they met . She went to see him at his hotel . He was enormously interested in what she was doing , interested in her writing and in the pictures she told him about . He went with her to her house to see them . He looked and gasped . ' I told you , ' he said , ' I always told you that you should keep your mind open . ' After having passed her entrance examinations she settled down in Baltimore and went to the medical school . The first two years of the medical school were all right . They were purely laboratory work , and Gertrude Stein , under Lewellys Barker , immediately betook herself to research work . She began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a comparative study . All this was later embodied in Lewellys Barker 's book . She delighted in Doctor Mall , professor of anatomy , who directed her work . She always quotes his answer to any student excusing himself or herself for anything . He would look reflective and say : ' Yes , that is just like our cook . There is always a reason . She never brings the food to the table hot . In summer of course she ca n't because it is too hot . In winter of course she ca n't because it is too cold . Yes , there is always a reason . ' Doctor Mall believed in everybody developing their own technique . He also remarked : Nobody teaches anybody anything . At first every student 's scalpel is dull , and then later every student 's scalpel is sharp , and nobody has taught anybody anything . ' These first two years at the medical school Gertrude Stein liked well enough . She always liked knowing a lot of people and being mixed up in a lot of stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too bored with what she was doing , and , besides , she had quantities of pleasant relatives in Baltimore and she liked it . The last two years at the medical school she was bored ? frankly , openly bored . There was a good deal of intrigue and struggle among the students , that she liked , but the practice and theory of medicine did not interest her at all . It was fairly well known among all her teachers that she was bored , but as her first two years of scientific work had given her a reputation , everybody gave her the necessary credits and the end of her last year was approaching . It was then that she had to take her turn in the delivering of babies , and it was at that time that she noticed the Negroes and the places that she afterwards used in the second of the Three Lives stories , Melanctha Herbert , ' the story that was the beginning of her revolutionary work . As she always says of herself , she has a great deal of inertia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts somewhere else . As the graduate examinations drew near some of her professors were getting angry . The big men like Halsted , Osier , et cetera , knowing her reputation for original scientific work , made the medical examinations merely a matter of form and passed her . But there were others who were not so amiable . Gertrude Stein always laughed , and this was difficult . They would ask her questions , although , as she said to her friends , it was foolish of them to ask her when there were so many eager and anxious to answer . However they did question her from time to time , and , as she said , what could she do ? ? she did not know the answers and they did not believe that she did not know them ; they thought that she did not answer because she did not consider the professors worth answering . It was a difficult situation ; as she said , it was impossible to apologize and explain to them that she was so bored she could not remember the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the professors said that although all the big men were ready to pass her he intended that she should be given a lesson , and he refused to give her a pass mark and so she was not able to take her degree . There was great excitement in the medical school . Her very close friend , Marion Walker , pleaded with ho : . She said , ' But Gertrude , Gertrude , remember the cause of women , ' and Gertrude Stein said , ' You do n't know what it is to be bored . ' The professor who had flunked her asked her to come to see him . She did . He said , ' Of course , Miss Stein , all you have to do is to take a summer course here , and in the fall naturally you will take your degree . ' ' But not at all , ' said Gertrude Stein , ' you have no idea how grateful I am to you . I have so much inertia and so little initiative that very possibly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have , well , not taken to the practice of medicine , but at any rate to pathological psychology , and you do n't know how little I like pathological psychology , and how all medicine bores me . ' The professor was completely taken aback , and that was the end of the medical education of Gertrude Stein . V During these years at Radcliffe and Johns Hopkins she often spent the summers in Europe . The last couple of years her brother had been settled in Florence , and now that everything medical was over she joined him there , and later they settled down in London for the winter . They settled in lodgings in London and were not uncomfortable . They knew a number of people through the Berensons ? Bertrand Russell , the Zangwills , then there was Willard ( Josiah Flynt ) , who wrote Tramping with Tramps , and who knew all about London pubs ? but Gertrude Stein was not very much amused . She began spending all her days in the British Museum reading the Elizabethans . She returned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in Elizabethan prose and particularly in the prose of Greene . She had little notebooks full of phrases that pleased her , as they had pleased her when she was a child . The rest of the time she wandered about the London streets and found them infinitely depressing and dismal . She always said that that first visit had made London just like Dickens , and Dickens had always frightened her . As she says , anything can frighten her , and London when it was like Dickens certainly did . But there were compensations . There was the prose of Greene , and it was at this time that she discovered the novels of Anthony Trollope , for her the greatest of the Victorians . It was at this time too that , as she says , she . esed to be worried about there being in the future nothing to read ; she said she felt that she would always somehow be able to find something . But the dismalness of London and the drunken women and children and the gloom and the lonesomeness brought back all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was leaving for America , and she left . She stayed in America the rest of the winter . In the meantime her brother also had left London and gone to Paris , and there later she joined him . She immediately began to write . She wrote a short novel . The funny thing about this short novel is that she completely forgot about it for many years . And so life in Paris began , and , as all roads lead to Paris , all of us are now there , and I can begin to tell what happened when I was of it . VI When I became an habitual visitor at the rue de Fleurus the Picassos were once more together , Pablo and Fernande . That summer they went again to Spain and he came back with some Spanish landscapes , and one may say that these landscapes , two of them still at the rue de Fleurus and the other one in Moscow in the collection that Stchoukine founded and that is now national property , were the beginning of cubism . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very evidently a strong Cezanne influence , particularly the influence of the late Cezanne water colors , the cutting up the sky not in cubes but in spaces . But the essential thing , the treatment of the houses , was essentially Spanish , and therefore essentially Picasso . In these pictures he first emphasized the way of building in Spanish villages , the line of the houses not following the landscape but cutting across the landscape . It was the principle of the camouflage of the guns and the ships in the war . The first year of the war , Picasso and Gertrude Stein and myself were walking down the boulevard Raspail a cold winter evening . All of a sudden down the street came some big cannon , the first any of us had seen painted ? that is , camouflaged . Pablo stopped , he was spellbound . C'est nous-qui awns fait ca , ' he said . ' It is we that have created that . ' And he was right , he had . From Cezanne through him they had come to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three landscapes . When they were first put up on the wall , naturally everybody objected . As it happened , he and Fernande had taken some photographs of the villages which he had painted , and he had given copies of these photographs to Gertrude Stein . When people said that the few cubes in the landscapes looked like nothing but cubes , Gertrude Stein would laugh and say , If you had objected to these landscapes as being too realistic , there would be some point in your objection . ' And she would show them the photographs , and really the pictures , as she rightly said , might be declared to be too photographic a copy of nature . This , then , was the beginning of cubism . Gertrude Stein always says that cubism is a purely Spanish conception and only Spaniards can be cubists , and that the only real cubism is that of Picasso and Juan Gris . Picasso created it and Juan Gris permeated it with his clarity and his exaltation . To understand this , one has only to read The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written upon the death of one of her two dearest friends , Picasso and Juan Gris , both Spaniards . She always says that Americans can understand Spaniards ; that they are the only two Western nations that can realize abstraction ; that in America it expresses itself by disembodiedness , in literature and machinery , in Spain by ritual so abstract that it does not connect itself with anything but ritual . I always remember Picasso saying disgustedly , apropos of some Germans who said they liked bullfights , ' They would , ' he said angrily , they like bloodshed . To a Spaniard it is not bloodshed , it is ritual . ' It was in these days that the intimacy between Braque and Picasso grew . It was in these days that Juan Gris , a raw , rather effusive youth , came from Madrid to Paris and began to call Picasso ' cher maitre , ' to Picasso 's great annoyance . It was apropos of this that Picasso used to address Braque as ' cher maitre , ' passing on the joke , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this joke to mean that Picasso looked up to Braque as a master . But I am once more running far ahead of these early Paris days when I first knew Femande and Pablo. // VII After a while the Picassos moved from the old studio in the rue Ravignan to an apartment in the boulevard Clichy . Fernande began to buy furniture and have a servant , and the servant of course made a souffle . It was a nice apartment with lots of sunshine . On the whole , however , Fernande was not quite as happy as she had been . There were a great many people there and even afternoon tea . Braque was there a great deal . It was the height of the intimacy between Braque and Picasso , it was at that time they first began to put musical instruments into their pictures . Fernando had at this time a new friend of whom she often spoke to me . This was Eve , who was living with Marcoussis . And one evening all four of them came to the rue de Fleurus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only time we ever saw Marcoussis until many many years later . I could perfectly understand Femande 's liking for Eve . Fernande 's great heroine was Evelyn Thaw , small and negative . Here was a little French Evelyn Thaw , small and perfect . Not long after this , Picasso came one day and told Gertrude Stein that he had decided to take an atelier in the rue Ravignan ; he could work better there . He could not get back his old one , but he took one on the lower floor . One day we went to see him there . He was not in and Gertrude Stein as a joke left her visiting card . In a few days we went again , and Picasso was at work on a picture on which was written ma jolie , ' and at the lower corner , painted in , was Gertrude Stein 's visiting card . As we went away Gertrude Stein said , Fernando is certainly not ma jolie . I wonder who it is . ' In a few days we knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring . One evening , the following autumn , Picasso came in . He and Gertrude Stein had a long talk alone . When she came in from having bidden him good-bye she said , Pablo said a marvelous thing about Fernande . He said her beauty always held him , but he could not stand any of her little ways . ' She further added that Pablo and Eve were now settled on the boulevard Raspail . In the meanwhile Gertrude Stein had received a letter from Fernande , very dignified , written with the reticence of a Frenchwoman . She said that she wished to tell Gertrude Stein that she understood perfectly that the friendship had always been with Pablo , and that although Gertrude had always shown her every mark of sympathy and affection , now that she and Pablo were separated , it was naturally impossible that in the future there should be any intercourse between them , because , the friendship having been with Pablo , there could of course be no question of a choice . That she would always remember their intercourse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever she were in need , to throw herself upon Gertrude 's generosity . And so Picasso left Montmartre never to return . VIII Helene used to stay at home with her husband Sunday evening ; that is to say , she was always willing to come but we often told her not to bother . I like cooking , I am an extremely good five-minute cook , and besides , Gertrude Stein liked from time to time to have me make American dishes . One Sunday evening I was very busy preparing one of these and then I called Gertrude Stein to come in from the atelier for supper . She came in much excited and would not sit down . ' Here , I want to show you something , ' she said . ' No , ' I said , ' it has to be eaten hot . ' ' No , ' she said , ' you have to see this first . ' Gertrude Stein never likes her food hot and I do like mine hot ; we never agree about this . In spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can still see the little tiny pages of the notebook written forward and back . It was the portrait called ' Ada , ' the first in Geography and Plays . I began it and I thought she was making fun of me , and I protested ; she says I protest now about my autobiography . Finally I read it all and was terribly pleased with it . And then we ate our supper . This was the beginning of the long series of portraits . ' Ada ' was followed by portraits of Matisse and Picasso and a great many others . She has written portraits of practically everybody she has known , and written them in all manners and in all styles . The writing of portraits occupied a great deal of that winter , and then we went to Spain . In those days Gertrude Stein wore a brown corduroy suit , jacket and skirt , a small straw cap , always crocheted for her by a woman in Fiesole , sandals , and she often carried a cane . That summer the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less this costume without the cap and the cane that Picasso has painted in his portrait of her . This costume was ideal for Spain ; they all thought of her as belonging to some religious order and we were always treated with the most absolute respect . I remember that once a nun was showing us the treasures in a convent church in Toledo . We were near the steps of the altar . All of a sudden there was a crash ? Gertrude Stein had dropped her cane . The nun paled , the worshipers startled . Gertrude Stein picked up her cane and turning to the frightened nun said reassuringly , ' No it is not broken . ' We finally came to Granada and stayed there for some time , and there Gertrude Stein worked terrifically . She was always very fond of Granada . It was there she had her first experience of Spain when still at college just after the Spanish-American War , when she and her brother went through Spain . They had a delightful time , and she always tells of sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when suddenly there was a terrific noise , the heehaw of a donkey . ' What is it ? ' said the young Bostonian , trembling . Ah , ' said the father , ' it is the last sigh of the Moor . ' We enjoyed Granada . We met many amusing people , English and American , and it was there and at that time that Gertrude Stein 's style gradually changed . She says hitherto she had been interested only in the insides of people , their character and what went on inside them ; it was during that summer that she first felt a desire to express the rhythm of the visible world . It was a long tormenting process ; she looked , listened , and described . She always was , she always is , tormented by the problem of the external and the internal . One of the things that always worries her about painting is the difficulty that the artist feels and which sends him to painting still-lifes ? that after all the human being essentially is not paintable . Once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has added something to the solution of this problem . She is interested in Picabia , in whom hitherto she has never been interested , because he at least knows that if you do not solve your painting problem in painting human beings you do not solve it at all . It is that of which she is always talking , and now her own long struggle with it was to begin . She experimented with everything in trying to describe . She tried a bit inventing words , but she soon gave that up . The English language was her medium and with the English language the task was to be achieved , the problem solved . The use of fabricated words offended her , it was an escape into imitative emotionalism . No , she stayed with her task , although after the return to Paris she described objects , she described rooms and objects , which , joined with her first experiments done in Spain , made the volume , Tender Buttons . She always , however , made her chief study people , and therefore the never-ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rue de Fleurus as usual . One of the people who had impressed me very much when I first came to the rue de Fleurus was Mildred Aldrich . She was then in her early fifties , a stout vigorous woman with a George Washington face , white hair , and admirably clean , fresh clothes and gloves . A very striking figure and a very satisfying one in the crowd of mixed nationalities . She was indeed one of whom Picasso could say , and did say , ' C'est elle qui fera la gloire de l'Arnivique . ' She made one very satisfied with one 's country , which had produced her . Her sister having left for America , she lived alone on the top floor of a building on the corner of the boulevard Raspail and the half street , rue Boissonade . There she had at the window an enormous cage filled with canaries . We always thought it was because she loved canaries . Not at all . A friend had once left her a canary in a cage to take care of during her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took excellent care of the canary in the cage . Some friend , seeing this and naturally concluding that Mildred was fond of canaries , gave her another canary . Mildred of course took excellent care of both canaries , and so the canaries increased and the size of the cage grew until , in 1914 , she moved to Huiry to the Hilltop on the Marne and gave her canaries away . Her excuse was that in the country cats would eat the canaries . But her real reason , she once told me , was that she really could not bear canaries . Mildred was an excellent housekeeper . I was very surprised , having had a very different impression of her , going up to see her one afternoon , finding her mending her linen and doing it beautifully . Mildred adored cablegrams , she adored being hard up ? or rather she adored spending money , and as her earning capacity although great was limited , Mildred was chronically hard up . In those days she was making contracts to put Maeterlinck 's Blue Bird on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my early memories of Mildred were of her coming to our little apartment in the rue NotreDame-des-Champs late in the evening and asking me to lend her the money for a long cable . A few days later the money was returned with a lovely azalea worth five times the money . No wonder she was always hard up . But everybody listened to her . No one in the world could tell stories like Mildred . I can still see her at the rue de Fleurus sitting in one of the big armchairs and gradually the audience increasing around her as she talked . She was very fond of Gertrude Stein , very interested in her work , enthusiastic about Three Eves , deeply impressed but slightly troubled by The Making of Americans , quite upset by Tender Buttons , but always loyal and convinced that if Gertrude Stein did it , it had something in it that was worth while . Mildred Aldrich liked Picasso and even liked Matisse ? that is , personally ? but she was troubled . One day she said to me , Alice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really all right ? I know Gertrude thinks so , and Gertrude knows , but really is it not all fumisterie , is it not all false ? ' This brings us pretty well to the spring of 1914 . During the previous winter Gertrude Stein 's brother decided that he would go to Florence to live . They divided between them the pictures that they had bought together . Gertrude Stein kept the Cezannes and the Picassos and her brother the Matisses and Renoirs , with the exception of the original Femme au Chapeau . Toward the end of June Gertrude Stein received a letter from John Lane , the publisher , saying he would be in Paris the following day and would come to see her . He called and asked her if she would come to London in July , as he had almost made up his mind to republish Three Lives , and would she bring another manuscript with her . She said she would , and she suggested a collection of all the portraits she had done up to that time . The Making of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , that having been arranged , John Lane left . In those days Picasso , having lived rather sadly in the rue Schcelcher , was to move a little further out to Mont- rouge . It was not an unhappy time for him , but after the Montmartre days one never heard his high , whinnying Spanish giggle . His friends , a great many of them , had followed him to Montparnasse , but it was not the same . It was in these days that Mildred Aldrich was preparing to retire to the Hilltop on the Marne . She too was not unhappy , but rather sad . She wanted us often in those spring evenings to take a cab and have what she called our last ride together . ' We often went out to the country with her to see her house . Finally she moved in . We went out and spent the day with her . Mildred was not unhappy , but she was very sad . My curtains are all up , my books in order , everything is clean , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her that when I was a little girl my mother said that I always used to say , ' What shall I do now ? ' ? which was only varied by ' Now what shall I do ? ' Mildred said that the worst of it was that we were going to London and that she would not see us all summer . We assured her that we would only stay away a month , in fact we had return tickets , and as soon as we got home we would go out to see her . Anyway she was happy that at last Gertrude Stein was going to have a publisher who would publish her books . II6lene was leaving Q7 rue de Fleurus because , her husband having recently been promoted to be foreman in his workshop , he insisted that she must not work out any longer but must stay at home . In short , in this spring and early summer of 1914 the old life was over .                 @ @ @ @
