There are twice as many hotels ( about 13,000 ) in the U. S. as there are hospitals . But hospitals have just as many beds ( 1,000,000 ) . Hotels take in $1,000,000,000 each year . For hospitals there are no comparable figures , because practically all are operated at a loss which neither their directors , trustees nor owners like to make public . On the other hand , they are frank in revealing their facilities for treating patients and teaching personnel . Statistics on those activities an American Medical Association committee headed by Stanford University 's President Ray Lyman Wilbur fully reported in the A. M. A. Journal last week . Significant excerpts : <P> Sixteen people entered U. S. hospitals every minute last year . They represented one-fifteenth of the nation 's population . Nine-tenths of the 8,646,885 entered general hospitals and stayed there an average of 13 days each . Of the children born in the U. S. last year , 38% were born in hospitals . <P> Some hospitals , notably State insane asylums , are overcrowded . Of 228 mental hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patients over normal capacity . In 74 the crowding was more than 15% beyond the rating . Four mental hospitals contained more than 50% excess patients . General hospitals complain of their empty beds , which last year totaled 35.7% of capacity . Some of these vacancies constitute a kind of insurance against over-crowding during epidemics , fires , flood , earthquakes . But many , argued one contributor to last week 's A. M. A. Journal , are due to a zest to build , although every bed in a U. S. hospital represents a cost of from $5,000 to $7,500 in space and equipment . Currently about 600 new hospitals are being built or planned . Proposed expenditures : $100,000,000 . <P> The A. M. A. last year refused to approve 581 hospitals . Reasons : alleged unethical practices , flagrant advertising , hiring of seriously unqualified personnel .
