txt Encouragement in the fact that in certain industries production and consumption have been balanced was expressed today by Julius H. Barnes , head of the National Business Survey Conference , formed at President Hoover 's suggestion . This was in a report on business conditions for the first eleven months of the year , which is held fairly representative of the year-end situation . While Mr. Barnes made no prediction of what may be expected in 1931 , he held that the balance achieved in some industries opens the way for increased activity , with a gradual expansion of the consuming power of the world . He called attention to the fact that while conditions remained depressed in many foreign countries , there was evidence of improvement in several nations , - among them the United Kingdom , Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , Canada , China and India . Managements Show Resourcefulness . In presenting the survey , Mr. Barnes made the following state-ment : " This summary of fact reports from many fields of business enterprise may , for practical purposes , indicate the year-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures used are largely in terms of dollar values . This means that , for industries furnishing dollar statistics , physical activities have been at a higher relative level than the statistics show . " These reports indicate , in line with present general impressions , that the sanguine expectations generally held early In 1930 , of greatly quickened trade before the end of the year , have not been realized . There is evidence of many industries having adapted themselves to current conditions and having successfully balanced production and market consumption . Through many industries runs the evidence that management by various resourceful devices has maintained employment at a higher ratio than the statistical index of operations . " Even during this recession , the aggregate volume of trade has manifestly been of larger proportions and there are indications of individual industries successful beyond the average , either because of special conditions or because of management qualities , courage , initiative and enterprise , which are typically American . " Other Encouraging Factors . Among other encouraging factors cited were the availability of abundant short-term credit at low interest charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high output of electric power , which dropped but 1 per cent below 1929 production for the eleven months ; the apparent adjustment of the automobile industry at low production levels from which to make a new start , relatively high level of department store sales and an increase in the latter part of November in the activities of telegraph companies . On the other hand , steel mills operations were at but 43 per cent of capacity in November , as compared with 53 per cent in October ; electric manufactures were 30 per cent below November , 1929 ; construction contracts for the eleven months were 54,275,000,000 , as against $5,437,000 , - 000 a year ago .
