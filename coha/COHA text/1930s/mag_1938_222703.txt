Like men attracted by the inaccessibility of Mt . Everest , libertarians are attracted to Jersey City , N. J .. where Mayor Frank Hague stifles any " Red " seeking to speak well in public of C. I. O. Montana 's loud Representative Jerry O'Connell tried it twice in May , was scared out once , bums-rushed the next time . <P> Last week-as Boss Hague was haled into Federal District Court in nearb'y Newark by C. I. O. and the Civil Liberties Union to defend himself against a charge of abridging the constitutional right of free speech-Norman Thomas , whose Socialist Party claims partial credit for ex posing Jersey City as a place where civil liberties are dead , appeared in Newark 's Military Park to berate Mayor Hague publicly . His reward : howls , band music , ripe tomatoes , rotten eggs , an announcement by the park commissioner that hereafter Newark , like Jersey City , will permit no more anti-Hague meetings .
