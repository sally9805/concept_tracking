A new centre for the contemporary re-examination of architectural problems was set up in Chicago last year in the New Bauhaus , directed by Hungarian Designer Ladislaus Moholy-Nagy ( TIME , Oct. 25 ) . Last summer hopes of this school appeared to be borne out in an exhibition of fresh experimental work by its students ( TIME , July 11 ) . But last month opening day came and Chicago 's New Bauhaus did not reopen . Neither chunky Director Moholy-Nagy nor his backers , the supposedly well-heeled Association of Arts &; Industries , would say anything except to their lawyers until last week . Then Moholy-Nagy sued the A.A.I. for $2,750 back salary , intimated sadly that he had been gulled . But the A.A.I. had a bitter tale to tell of Moholy 's trying to " Hitlerize " the New Bauhaus , announced in some confusion that the school would re-open this week without him , then that it would re-open " soon .
