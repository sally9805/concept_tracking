" Messieurs , what is it but snobbery-le snobbism epouvantable-which causes Frenchmen to buy foreign cars ? " demanded Louis Renault , Dean of French motor makers , last week . " If foreign cars should come to dominate the French market , what a calamity ! . . . To have lost a million and a half men in the war to escape German tutelage , only to fall under the tutelage of America ! Mon Dieu that would be more than Frenchmen could bear ! Tell these things to your readers-urge them to support the wise , the necessary law of M. Flandin . " French reporters bowed and withdrew . <P> Six weeks ago M. Pierre Etienne Flandin , Minister of Commerce , sent an ultimatum in the direction of the U. S. Senate : " If others build tariff walls , France will build tariff walls ! " ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) . M. Flandin 's wall , scheduled to go before the Chamber of Deputies this month , provides : 1 ) Increased duties on assembly parts ranging from 30% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45% on complete cars raised to 90% , practically a prohibitive duty . <P> Correspondents were told by U. S. motor men in Paris that such duties would mean doubling the retail price of Fords assembled in France , thus making it impossible for this car , shrewdly advertised as Le Ford Franais , to compete with what French Ford salesmen call " other French cars " such as Citroens , Baby Peugeots , Baby Renaults . <P> Immediate result of publication of the Flandin Tariff Bill : Prime Minister Andre Tardieu of France was pressingly invited to a strictly private dinner by the new U. S. Ambassador , onetime Senator Walter Evans Edge , who , though he believes in a high U. S. Tariff , must convince M. Tardieu that a high French tariff would be injudicious .
