txt Mayor Walker 's answer to the demands of the civic associations for slashes in city expenditures is that no spurring on by the civic associations would be necessary if there was room for the curtailment of the city 's outlays . This would have been accomplished by the Budget Director , the Mayor 's own appointee , and by the Board of Estimate in. the budget making period if it had been deemed possible without drastically affecting the general welfare of the city . The Mayor 's attitude on this point was voiced last night by his friends and advisers in the city administration , in advance of the heralded " show-down " hearing of the civic association heads , to be held before the full Board of Estimate at City Hall at 3 o'clock this afternoon . The Mayor 's friends denied emphatically last night that the Mayor was in any way " passing the buck " to the civic associations regarding the formulation of an economy program . The denial was occasioned by the publication yesterday of the attitude of the Fifth Avenue Association that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it was up to the administration to find how this could be accomplished . Mayor Aware of Conditions . The Mayor , it was said , is well aware of the serious situation confronting the real estate interests in the city , but he maintains the attitude that every dollar expended by the City Administration is bringing in a dollar 's worth to the taxpayers . The Mayor and his advisers , however , it was said yesterday , were still working out new sources of revenues so that increases in the general fund for the reduction of taxation will reduce the amount of the next tax levy . Today , at the meeting of civic associations in the Board of Estimate chamber , the Mayor is expected to voice those sentiments to his listeners and to take up the varied activities of the City Government , contending in each case that the expenditures are vital to the carrying on of the City Government . He is expected to dwell at length on the city 's welfare activities , showing that a very large percentage of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasioned by the unprecedented demands upon the city for relief of the unemployed , increased appropriations for veterans ' relief and the coincident demands on city hospitals and city-supported institutions for the poor . It would be poor economy to curtail these activities at the present time , the Mayor is expected to contend . The Mayor , it was said , resents strongly the implication of the Fifth Avenue Association that he had attempted to pass the responsibility for formulating an economy program back to those who had been demanding it , particularly , his friends said , because that association was not represented at the preliminary conference of I civic associations with the Mayor that resulted in the calling of the open hearing before the Board of Estimate today . The purpose of the conference to- day , the Mayor 's advisers declared yesterday , was to give the civic association heads the opportunity to say " in the open " what they had sought to convey to him privately concerning their ideas on relief for the taxpayers . It has been understood that the Mayor is disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to force the city , in the emergency , to shift the burden to some extent on the subway car rider . Representatives of practically every large civic association in the City are expected to be present at today 's meeting . The Fifth Avenue Association , the Greater New York Taxpayers ' Association , the New York Real Estate Board , the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York , the West Side Association of Commerce , the New York City League of Women Voters , the Citizens Union and others are expected to take part in the discussion . Slashing of city salaries is expected to be broached by more than one speaker . The Mayor 's attitude thus far has been that the city can do this legally only in the case of a limit ed number of small-salaried employes and in the case of a few higher-paid employes and that the saving would be negligible . One suggestion for a salary slash was made public yesterday by the New York City League of Women Voters , and it is expected to be preaented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 per cent cut 1 in salaries of $5,000 and over , 10 per cent in salaries from $3,000 to $5,000 , and 1 per cent from $1,200 to , $3,000 . The league declared that ' $7.000,000 a year could be saved by the cuts in the first two classes and that the 1 per cent cut in the lower salaries " will awaken all city employes to the necessity for eliminating waste and promoting economy . " Offer Six Suggestions . The league offered the following summary of its other suggestions for municipal economies : 1 . Elimination of astonishing inequalities and what seem to be gross overpayments to employes 2 . That the number of chauffeurs be limited to those who drive city trucks and ambulances and to one chauffeur apiece for commissioners and elected officials with the exception of the Mayor . 3 . A change in the fiscal year to save $3,000,000 or thereabouts in interest charges . 4 . A revision of water rates to keep water supply on a self-sustaining basis . 5 , Immediate report on possible new sources of revenue . 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . The West Side Association of Commerce will present to the board at today 's hearing a recommendation that if adopted " would mean a reduction of not less than fifty points in the basic tax rate , " an announcement from the Committee of Ten Thousand Citizens said yesterday . The announcement did not state what the recommendation would be , but it was believed that it would concern subway fares and the city 's policy of financing subway construction by short-term bonds , redeemable out of budgetary funds .
