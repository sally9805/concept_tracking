According to figures released last week , gross box-office receipts for the cinema industry in 1936 were a billion dollars , $250,000,000 more than last year . Weekly theatre attendance was 81,000,000-compared to 71,000,000 in 1935 , 54,000,000 in 1933 . Main reasons for the industry 's gain were undoubtedly increased prosperity and better pictures . A contributing reason was undoubtedly " Bank Night " - currently a weekly fiesta at 5,000 of the 15,000 active U. S. cinema theatres . <P> Bank Night is a copyright scheme invented by a onetime Fox booking agent named Charles U. Yaeger , who leases it to theatres for from $5 to $50 a week depending on their size . What it amounts to is a clever evasion of state &; municipal lottery laws whereby , by registering his name at a theatre , a patron becomes eligible to win a substantial prize if he is present at the theatre on " Bank Night " - when the prize is awarded to the holder of a lucky ticket after a drawing on the theatre stage . Since Bank Nights started in 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office to a Denver building and a chain of theatres . Perpetually under fire from state and municipal authorities who hope to find some way in which to bring it under local lottery laws , Bank Night last week experienced the worst storm of its stormy history in Chicago . <P> Estimated Bank Night prizes in Chicago theatres last year totaled $6,000,000 . <P> Last week $100,000 in unclaimed prizes were on hand when Police Commissioner James P. Allman suddenly announced that Bank Night drawings violated a city ordinance , arrested 16 theatre managers , warned 250 more to stop Bank Nights forthwith . Making their arrests during the distribution of prizes , police were roundly booed by Chicago cinema audiences . In one theatre , the winner of a $10 prize had it confiscated as evidence before he could grab it . <P> Hardest hit by the Bank Night ban was the Balaban &; Katz chain of 39 Chicago theatres whose Bank Night profits are estimated at $60,000 a week . First move of Balaban &; Katz was to discontinue Bank Night in all their theatres . <P> Four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Walter T. Stanton to issue an injunction restraining police from interfering with drawings on the ground that Bank Night did not come under the lottery laws . Balaban &; Katz promptly re-opened Bank Night drawings . Warner Bros , and smaller Chicago chains planned to follow suit . <P> How Chicago 's Bank Night row would end or whether theatre patrons would ever get the $100,000 in prizes which have drawn them into Chicago theatres , there seemed no way of guessing until the 16 arrested theatre managers ' cases are heard in court next week . Meanwhile , Corporation Counsel Barnet Hodes promised that police would continue to raid Chicago theatres that gave away prizes . <P> Outside Chicago last week , Bank Night was still holding its own against state lottery laws . In Topeka , Kans. , the Supreme Court ruled that Bank Night as practiced by certain Fox Theatres was illegal . In Albany , N. Y. , the Court of Appeals ruled Bank Nights legal .                    @
