" The average diner-out will pick the dish with the fancy colors every time . " <P> " The younger generation is not trained in the art of eating . Nor drinking either . " <P> " Americans are now a predominantly meat and potato eating people . " <P> Such resigned generalities as these filled the air in Philadelphia 's elegant Bellevue-Stratford Hotel last week as 1,000 restaurateurs gathered for the annual convention of the International Stewards &; Caterers Association . The delegates listened appreciatively when a representative of Tested Selling , Inc. hissed : ' ' Do n't sell the steak ; sell the sizzle . " * For president they re-elected genial William A. Heaman , who is steward of the Harvard Union ( freshman dining hall ) and is regarded by Harvardmen as no heir to Brillat-Savarin . <P> Including both steward dietitians like Mr. Heaman , feeders of groups ( undergraduates , the employes of big corporations , etc. ) , and the traditionalists of the industry , old-line French , German and Alsatian " kitchen men , " Association members buy upwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have handled nearly that much liquor business . Typical was the Roosevelt-Du Pont wedding last July when caterers offered what was , for them , a skimpy repast of hors d'oeuvres , ice cream and cakes , but made up for it with champagne . Even thicker than sample-passers from food companies at the convention last week were wine and liquor salesmen , whose stocks of courtesy cocktails ran out fast . Budweiser was served free on the hotel roof . A waiters ' champagne race down Broad Street made staid Philadelphians stare . <P> No. 1 spectacle of the meeting was the annual culinary and confectionery art show . Among its exhibits : Independence Hall in spun sugar ; hams made up as mandolins ; a prize wicker work cake by the chef of Philadelphia 's Ritz-Carlton ; a prize 18-lb. mousse de foie gras which cost Chef Fernand Gspann four days ' labor and $20 to build of sliced truffles , tongue and egg white . Spectacle No. 2 was a beauty contest for local waitresses on " National Distillers Night , " which turned rowdy when merrymaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon that day a special party of gourmets entered another world by visiting the Philadelphia Zoo at feeding time . <P> More serious matters were broached on the convention floor . Menus , it was declared , are becoming larger , less cluttered with items , often illustrated , because " what the eye sees the mind may want . " Deploring " leakage at the bar , " Restaurant Accountant James E. McNamara observed that ' " in the first place it is easier to waste a liquid than a solid ; in the second place there is much more temptation to employes in a bottle than in a box . . . . " Sales Manager A. A. Schipke of International Silver Co. besought the stewards to screen their garbage cans and buy genuine silver . " In Massachusetts , " said he , " we recovered two tons of silver from restaurant garbage in one month , proving that losses which you blame on the poor public are usually due to careless help .
