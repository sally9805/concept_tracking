GRADE A notables arriving at the New York World 's Fair this spring may be met by a glittering motor truck stuffed with impressive gadgets and squired by worried young men who will give them their first experience with television interviews . Outwardly , that will be a sign that , after years of being just around the corner , television has actually arrived . Inwardly , it will be a sign of a great spiritual lift for radio news . With its brilliant , full-orchestra handling of the European crisis last fall , radio news came unmistakably of age and was universally congratulated . But among themselves , veteran radio newsmen are already weeping into their beer about the good old days when the question was n't , " Should we cover this ? " but , " Do you think we can ? " and the harried engineers , wiping sweat from their brows , answered , " No harm in trying . " They probably have n't long to weep . With television , the good old days will he right back again . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterical history of the development of radio news that has given the boys such screwball good old days to weep over . News broadcasting , whether in radio or television , is by all odds the best way for engineers to set themselves tougher and tougher practical problems to solve . The first general American broadcast was news  --  the Harding-Cox election , put on the air by Pittsburgh 's KDKA to the delight of scattered crystal-set owners . The first general television broadcasts will also be some kind of news events , in all probability . From 1920 on , radio engineers went tirelessly on kidding themselves into steadily improving the flexibility and range of short-wave radio pickups by promising the boss broadcasts from the unlikeliest spots they could think of  --  submarines , airplanes , the floors of political con= ventions  --  and making good . From being delighted with the thrill of vicarious presence at fires , floods and frog-jumping contests , the radio-owning public came to expect hot news . More and more news was put on the air under greater and greater technical difficulties . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European crisis was so thoroughly expected that few listeners bothered to consider it at all miraculous . In eighteen years we have come to expect , as a matter of course , that , if anything sufficiently important is going on anywhere , an American radio reporter speaking good United States will he right on the ground , with his description of the situation pouring out of a shiny box at the national elbow . Given enough time and experimental news broadcasts , we will take television news the same way . But in the meantime the boys will have had lots of fun again . From the outsider 's point of view , of course . it is hard to see what they are squawking about . Few outsiders have any idea of the split-second scrambling , the atmosphere as of the old college try  --  often mingled with hidden-ball tricks worthy of the old Carlisle Indians  --  that lie behind the operations of a radio special-events department . That is the official name . Unofficially , it is the " brainstorm department " ? a term invented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible right on schedule in experimental news broadcasts way back when . Certainly . brainstorming is still a far livelier way of paying the rent than modern newspaper journalism , which is pretty cut and dried gibbering and jittering into the night , the solemn-minded variously decided in print : That it proved radio should be Government-run . That it proved radio should not be Government-run . That it showed grave lacks in national organization for emergencies . That it demonstrated the low average I.Q. of the radio audience . But radio newsmen thought of the nightmare by H. G. Wells out of Orson Welles in terms of scoops and inter-network rivalry . Paul White , head news wrangler of CBS , which had broadcast the Martians , confessed himself bewildered . " You would have thought they 'd have tuned in another station to check up before they started for tall timber , " he said . " We 've had our share of scoops here . But , after all if men from Mars were really romping round in Jersey , would Columbia be the only outfit to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fatal evening , NBC 's New York offices were badly pestered by phone calls from people who had had the sense to check up . " If it was somebody I knew , " said an employee taking such calls , " I told ' ern it was all a phony . But if it was just another chump , I said , ' You call Wickersham 2-2000 ; they 'll be glad to tell you all about it . ' " Wickersham 2-2000 is Columbia 's phone number . large circular bruises on his forehead , as if he had been well kicked by a newly shod jackass . He had turned the wrong valve when deep under water  --  and water pressure outside had jammed his goggles into his forehead at 1000 pounds to the inch . They told him afterward that 1200 pounds would have crushed his skull . Paul White says that , according to a psychologist he knows , radio 's scoopomania is the brainstorm er 's somewhat childish compensation for having to work twenty-two-hour shifts so often . Since many brainstormers are reformed newspapermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from the take-it-in-stride news-gathering smoothness of the daily paper to the Frank . Merriwell psychology of radio news events . Paul White , for instance , is a calloused veteran of the United Press who could sit for a composite portrait of every square-jawed , heavy-shouldered and absolutely unexcitable city editor in the United States . He might screen well in a Spencer Tracy role , but there is absolutely no Tyrone Power or Robert Taylor about him . Over in the NBC special-events department sits another city-room alumnus , A. A. Schechter ? " Abe " to a host of Broadway friends . He has tours of Associated Press and International News Service duty to now  --  except in the movies . Good old days or not , there will be little reason for brainstormers to die of boredom while waiting for television to come along . Between nervous strain and actual physical hazards , they are still notoriously bad life-insurance risks . Radio journalism , still young , remains as brash as the newspaper back in the Early Pulitzer or Nellie 331y period . And as crazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding Davis story . When the Munich agreement finally settled the war crisis , the news came as a radio scoop . First Columbia Broadcasting System was happy because their Ed Murrow , speaking from London , was one minute ahead of competitors in announcing definitely the signing of the agreement . But then National Broadcasting Company 's Max Jordan beat the world with an English summary of the terms by forty-six minutes . Not forty-five  --  not a vague three quarters of an hour , mind you . Radiomen are extremely stopwatch-minded and , in their terms , getting a bulletin on the air two minutes ahead of the competition is great stuff . When those Martian monsters invaded New Jersey last fail , sending thousands of radio listeners According to a rumor over at Columbia , however , a panicky NBC subordinate had called an important NBC man to the phone in the middle of his quiet Sunday evening at home . " All hell 's broke loose , " said the subordinate , clutching at the mouthpiece . " They got another beat on us over there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , eat and sleep with the hair-trigger necessity of getting ahead of the other fellow . One result of that is to assure the listening public of getting hotter news than ever before in history . Another inevitable result is that , having done the dashing reporter to death , Hollywood is toying with the idea of a movie about brainstormers , who often get into situations temptingly reminiscent of the Perils of Pauline . During a recent Washington inaugural , for instance , a CBS newsman , broadcasting from over the procession in a hired blimp , was obliged to climb out of the gondola and hang by his hands , several hundred feet above the pavement , while his twitching feet disentangled a messed-up trailing antenna , An NBC stalwart , recently broadcasting from inside a trick diving apparatus , turned up next day with twohis credit . Sandy-haired , stocky and nervous , Abe Schechter , too , falls short of the Hollywood beau ideal . Schechter 's commanding officer is John Royal , who worked up from copy boy to reporter on the old-time Boston newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  way back yonder when the first SOS was sent from a ship in distress . John Royal 's profile would by no means stop a clock , but it would not be likely to stop a talent scout either . The search for photogenic profiles probably would skip WOR as well . There we find Johnny Johnstone , a rotund , begoggled specialist in getting ahead of his huge network rivals with half their equipment and a quarter of their budget . Another reportorial veteran is William Burke ( Skeets ) Miller . of NBC . When he was on the Louisville Courier-Journal years ago , Skeets won a Pulitzer prize and a job on the old New York World at one and the some time by crowding his paperweight body into the Floyd Collins cave down in Kentucky and doing a masterly job of covering that story . His mosquito build also has served him to advantage in radio reporting . It won him the hazardous honor of being ( Continued an Pagst31 ) the first transpacific airplane passenger , since he was entitled to a weight discount and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . But of course Skeets does n't tip the scales at Gable standards and is disqualified automatically for a Gable role . But it is all too easy to see why the history of news casting is tempting to producer and screen writer . That earlier day which brainstormers mourn so was the grand period of stunt broadcasts  --  prearranged occasions , with " firsts " as the main point . There was the first broadcast of a volcano in eruption , with the microphones set so close to the lava-splashed rim of the crater of Vesuvius that no sooner were they installed than a burst of lava would swallow them up . And NBC 's first broadcast out of wartime Abyssinia , beating its rivals only because international sleuthing had turned up a dot-and-dash set owued by an expatriate Swede in the Abyssinian interior which was just barely capable of being converted into a short-wave radio-telephone transmitter . Stunts still survive , of course , for special occasions . The most striking recent example was NBC 's Navy Day broadcast last year of three-way conversations between Washington and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines  --  which developed , among other interesting features , the fact that a certain high-ranking admiral sounds exactly like W. C. Fields . The most elaborate was sending a whole short-wave broadcasting crew to Canton Island , far away in the Pacific , to broadcast a quarter-hour eclipse of the sun . But now that engineering can make radio Johnny-on-the-spot almost anywhere , straight coverage is pushing cooked-up stunts farther out of the picture every day . Silk  --  Hat Sending The newspaperman will always have the physical bulge on the radio brainstormer . He has only to be on the spot , find out what goes on and get to a telegraph wire or telephone . The brainslormer ca n't cover his assignment of broadcasting from the actual spot unless he has lugged along some delicate and often fairly cumbersome transmit , tit-1g equipment . Portable short-wave equipment , sending signals for pickup and rebroadcast , is pretty slick these days , as a result of years of ingenious tinkering . NBC , for instance , has a famous transmitting set contained in a silk hat  --  designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile or so under average conditions . But equipment that will carry farther  --  and news events do n't always obligingly take place just where you want them to  --  requires a truck or a plane . Imagine trying to cover a story out in the bushes somewhere if , everywhere you go , you must pack along a vacuum cleaner and a complete picnic kit . It can be done , of course , just as Mathew Brady photographed the Civil War with a cumbersome wet-plate camera and a wagon made into a traveling darkroom . During the Ohio floods in 1936 the networks ' short-wave transmitters often saved a lot of lives since they were the only means of directing rescue work from towns that had seen telegraph and telephone communication ruined by swirling yellow water . But life would be a lot simpler for the brainstormer if he were n't Lied to gadgets the way a lady is tied to her handbag . Also if he had the newspaperman 's privilege of using the telephone in emergencies . But that is out of bounds  --  for technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . The brainstormer is forbidden by regulations to phone his headquarters from the scene of a story and have his voice put on the air over an ordinara , phone circuit . Radio , of course , makes tremendous use of specially leased phone wires to pipe programs from one station to another . When covering a story that is scheduled well ahead of time  --  a convention or a parade  --  it makes previous arrangements to have phone wires stripped and readied for radio transmission . But , since such preparation requires both time and red tape , a suddenly breaking story puts phones out of the question . Theoretically , that is . Practically  --  well , brainstormers are human and , if the temptation is too strong , the invisible bars across the door of a convenient phone booth may get badly bent . When the Hindenburg exploded at Lakehurst , New Jersey , for instance , a certain radio employee dived into the only available phone booth and kept the circuit open by bulletins and inane conversation alternately until NBC 's sound-equipment truck arrived and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS was talking over transatlantic telephone to its Prague correspondent , lining up future broadcasts . At that point the correspondent was handed a red-hot bulletin about the Czechs ' definite decision to give in . Nobody hesitated . Regulations were broken with a crash that might have been heard in Prague , and another regular-eireui t phone conversation went shamelessly on CBS for a news beat . The responsible party says that , if there 's any trouble about it , he will fight it all the way down the line on the Federal radio law 's stipulation that broadcasting stations must pay maximum regard to " public service , convenience and necessity . " Luck obviously plays a huge role in a radio scoop . Columbia 's first major news beat was a play-by-play description from inside the walls of the Ohio State Penitentiary while it was burning down . Just previously the network had broadcast a prison concert from there as a stunt . Equipment was still in place when the fire broke out . So all CBS had to do was to get an announcer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions . Mutual scored neatly in getting the first post-landing interview from the Merrill-Lambie plane on one of its transatlantic flights  --  because the fliers came down at Squantum , Massachusetts . right across the road from the transmitting station of Mutual 's Boston outlet . Mutual just ran a cable with a mike on the end out of the window . Of course , luck can be helped along by an application of the sandbag when temptation is too strong . For sewing up an exclusive  --  special broadcasting privileges of a special event  --  does not always guarantee that the thing will stay exclusive . Short-wave broadcasts from Europe can be picked up by any station within range and rebroadcast just as simply as if the signals were n't somebody else 's baby . The all-time brainstorming epic of no-holds-barred , **25;1516;TOOLONG competition will probably always be what went on during the Howard Hughes round-the-world flight last year . It started as an NBC show , with NBC technicians readying equipment for the technical feat of following the plane 's progress around the world . But when the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasting privileges were thrown open to all corners and the scramble begun . All three networks covered the take-oft . NBC was figuring on the inside track for the first plane-to-shore broadcast from over the Atlantic . But Columbia had made other arrangements with a strategically placed third party . RCA , the receiving and transmitting agency , parent of NBC , was going out of its mind trying to lean over backward in adjusting rival claims . When the argument was at its hottest and the plane was about to give tongue , the crucial third party , on whose say-so the whole Columbia case rested , was nowhere to be found . What happened then will probably never be any clearer than what became of Charley Ross . But most authorities agree that , just in time , a voice alleging itself to be that of the crucial third party spoke over the phone to RCA and confirmed Columbia 's claim to first blood . By the time checkups could be made , the plane was already on the air via Columbia . And Columbia 's Mr. White was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man for whom life holds no more . Howard Hughes and party roared on , and inter-network scrimmaging followed . NBC saved their skins in Berlin and Moscow  --  in Berlin only by indignantly denying over a transatlantic phone , at the last minute , that they had agreed to share the landing broadcast with any rivals . To make sure of monopolizing the Alaska landing , NBC engineers had already tied up the one telephone wire from Juneau to Seattle and were reading the funny papers to each other to hold the circuit open . But then that turned out to be a U. S. Army wire , and the other networks made it so hot for the Army that the circuit was thrown open to all corners . Winnipeg or Minneapolis would he next  --  probably Winnipeg . But , just in case , each network sent a transmitting outfit and crew to the Minneapolis landing field . That turned out to he Mutual 's inning . Nothing had been heard of the plane for some hours . Winnipeg looked so likely that only Mutual was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One rival crew had gone home in disgust . The other was breakfasting away from the held . The breakfasting crew is said to have received , the following wire from the boss in New York : " For your information , Howard Hughes landed yesterday in your home town . " A Royal Tug of War Then , to make sure that the entire performance made no sense whatever , CBS beat its competitors on the final arrival of the plane at New York , plus an interview with Hughes , simply because Hughes flew over a Columbia . transmitting station on the way in . There is another version of that from NBC , of course , but it is n't altogether printable . There are always other versions , or else a thick veil of mystery . Just as nobody knows just what happened on the Belgrade train the night two network rivals were returning empty-handed from their efforts to get King Carol of Rumania to broadcast at an interesting crisis in his affairs . During negotiations they had stuck closer together than Bergen and McCarthy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose sight of the other for five minutes would probably mean something approaching breach of promise . When the king finally said no as if lie meant it , the rivals took neighboring compartments on the outgoing train . But one of them may have taken even more practical precautions . For , whets the other fellow came to next morning , he found that his only pair of pants had been stolen . His rival still sticks to the theory that a sneak thief lifted them while the train was stopped at a wayside station . Those gentlemen were special radio . correspondents ; several of whom are ICentineed on page 33 ) // ( Continued fr .. , Page 911 ) maintained on full time in England and on the Continent  --  a new breed of journalist . Teletype services , one main-tamed by regular newspaper-wire services , the other radio 's own layout of correspondents and editors , supply regular news bulletins to radio networks . But for on-the-spot coverage when something is hot , the networks need special correspondents , just as The New York Times has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from the Associated Press . By having a man in the right part of China at the right moment , NBC got a big red feather in its cap by putting on the air , via transpacific short wave , the comment of the temporary head of the Chinese Government on the Chiang Kai-shek kidnaping . Within a literal ten seconds of the wire bulletin that Corrigan had landed in Ireland , the philosophical Mr. White was jamming through a transatlantic phone call to CBS 's London correspondent : " Get Corrigan on the air from Dublin . " Who 's Corrigan ? " asked London . " He 's an aviator who started for California last night , " said Mr. White . " Then what 's he doing in Dublin ? " countered London , with some logic . After two minutes of explanation , the London man was arranging a short-wave Corrigan interview . Expensive , yes . But thrifty if you work fast enough . For to get on the air Iirst means that the opposition will have to spend twice as much to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavishly . Without count , ing regular salaries and overhead , a big network 's bill for covering the European crisis could hardly have been under 565,000 . Short-wave facilities from Europe to the United States cost some ten dollars a minute . And transatlantic communications , phone , cable and wireless , are kept red-hot when something big is on . Radio Luck Given enough of a story , the networks wo n't let even their own laws of the Medes and Persians stand in their way . The Hindenburg disaster smashed the networks ' strict renunciation of broadcasting transcriptions of news events . A transcription is a fancy phonograph record of the original broadcast , and can be used for rebroadcast . Only radio luck made a transcription of that tragedy available , to begin with . Because her regular schedule had ceased to be news , no radio events department had bothered to cover the big airship 's arrival . But WLS , Chicago , had an announcer and recording equipment out at Lakehurst to get the sound effects of the arrival for a travel series , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine description as the big bag drifted down in the rain , and then went up in a stunning whoosh of flame . The repercussion blew the needle out of its groove . Instinctively the narrator put it back and went on talking . But he broke down under the horror of what he saw . He could only stammer and babble about it for minutes  --  an accidental effect far more vivid than anything a ealehln , ted job could have produced . Since a unique document like that was obviously irresistible rebroadcasting material , another rule went pop . The Mutual System , without as much to spend as its larger rivals , sometimes makes telling use of transcriptions . When the captain of the Queen Mary docked her in New Yorkwithout tugs last fall , during the tug-boatmen 's strike , Mutual was on the job in the early morning with a transcription outfit . The event was rebroadcast later in the day with great effect . The European crisis caught Mutual without facilities for on-the-spot coverage . The boys made a very good best of the short-wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , Prague , Berlin , Warsaw and Moseow . These international sound-offs were transcribed , and then , when 1 he returns were all in , rebroadcast for American listeners as a daily international rodeo of conflicting propaganda , with Prague symbolically sandwiched between Rome and Berlin . The clash of hysterical special pleading on both sides did give a remarkably satisfactory picture of the emotions and publicity technique of European nations . Famous Phonies Generally , transcribed programs of news are eschewed because of radio 's pride in being on the spot , and no fooling . Brainstormers boast that , although the date line on a newspaper story may not always mean exactly what it says , radio does mean just what it says when the announcer offers to " take you now to the wardroom of the U. S. S. Zenith , " The claim is well justified . But radio has hada couple of famous phonies , just the same . One was the stunt of an overenthusiastic brainstormer who broadcast from a small Indiana town the rupture , complete with police shootings and revolver shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it developed that it had been merely an impromptu dramatization , with the state cops as amateur cast , of what might have taken place , but did n't .. The other case was bad timing on the part of some Englishmen . During the 1937 coronation , London broadcast a short-wave program from a bathing beach in one of the dominions , with swimmers coming dripping from the surf to tell the mike how they felt about the proceedings halfway round the world in Westminster Abbey . " Halfway round the world " is the catch . According to the clock at the time of the broadcast , it was then two 5.51. in that particular part of the British Empire . So far , broadcasting actual war has been a knotty problem . Interviews with military big shots at headquarters are sometimes feasible , starting with Floyd Gibbons ' Manchukuo campaign in 1932 . II . V. Kaltenborn 's Spanish-war job , with the booming of field guns and the whine of bullets overhead going short-wave to America , has so far , however , been rivaled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar during a bombardment , with Franco 's exploding shells making her candle flame flicker . A general policy of sending commentators and transmitting equipment into fighting areas will probably take a long time coming . For one thing , a shell explosion too close will put any current microphone right out of commission . For another , governments would probably feel that the sordidness of modern warfare would be bad medicine on the air . The next big war may bring you lots of marching bands and propaganda , but it wo n't fetch dying men 's groans right into your lap . For a third , says Paul White , anybody sending good field equipment into either army engaged in war would just be making an expensive present to that side . No intelligence staff would 34 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 2$. 117.70 hesitate ten seconds about confiscating it for purely military uses . From the professional point of view , hazards much worse than shrapnel occur when bulletins of startling news have to be out into commercial programs . It is n't that the sponsor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion depending on how much damage the cut-in did . During the European crisis sponsors mostly agreed to let the news come in free of charge . But the trouble is that the performers on the scheduled program are unaware that they are off the air and go right on with the script . What they may be doing when they go back on the air again sometimes fits very poorly ? , or all too well  --  with the news bulletin that preceded . For instance , a great ecclesiastical dignitary-made a radio statement about the European crisis  --  a first-class historical event ; at the time important enough to break into whatever was going on . " The next voice you hear , " said the announcer , " will be that of ? " and he named a very reverend name indeed . From somewhere among the nooks and crannies of s Midwestern outlet , where the right switch had not been thrown , came an impressive voice : " Zilch 's beer , " it said , " will quench your thirst . " Worse can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a commercial program a couple of years ago , the bulletin announcement ended : " . . . the exact number of dead is not yet known . " Listeners were immediately switched back to the regular program , on which a husky contralto was starting to sing : " Take a number from one to ten , double it , and add a million ? " Plenty of other things can go wrong . The listener seldom knows about it , but brainstormers yarn about such occasions forever afterward . Back when Professor Piceard was stratosphere-ballooning over Europe , NBC 's Max Jordan was told off , with six fast cars full of crew and portable equipment , to follow his flight and interview him as soon as he landed . It was a needle-inthe-haystack assignment . So everybody was delighted when , somewhere in Switzerland , they caught sight of a tiny , gleaming silver ball on the hori zon  --  obviously Professor Piecard on his way down after going higher than any human being since Elijah . But . half an hour later the balloon was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened along looked with awe at this impressive line-up of men , motors and gadgets . " Ilfugnifulue ! " be said . " So many people and so much machinery just to look at a star . " The balloon was the planet Venus , which , as amateur astronomers know , is often visible in broad daylight . On another occasion a speaker who took too long and a rigid broadcasting schedule made it necessary to present the Pulitzer prize to Arthur Brock , of The New York Times , from a temporary broadcasting setup in the men 's room of a New York hotel . Then there was the professional parachute jumper with a pack transmitter on his back . He was to broadcast his sensations as he dropped . Being nervous about having to ad-lib his sensations , he was supplied with a written script for emergencies . He bailed out in fine style . Once the chute was open , he looked for the script . But it had blown out of his hand . Suffering from a bad case of mike fright five thousand feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dignified silence is the one thing guaranteed not to go over on the radio . At least one mechanical emergency gave hearers more than they bargained for . NB ( ' was to broadcast a stratosphere balloon flight conducted by two naval offieers seeking a record . The setup was perfect . A running narrative flowed smoothly from the narrow little globular cabin that swung below the great sphere of helium . Way up , higher than any mountain , the balloon began to rip and lose gas . The hurried consultations of the aeronauts came over as clear as a bell . They reported calmly that the balloon , having lost buoyancy altogether , was falling free . " Do you think you 'll be able to get down ? " queried an anxious announcer , for the benefit of his radio audience . " Get down ? " said an irritated voice , untold thousands of feet in the air . " That 's just what we 're doing  --  too damn fast for comfort . " The only thing to do was to bail out with parachutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept right on coming , down to the grunt and shove with which one aeronaut pushed his harness-encumbered comrade out the small porthole that led into empty space . International short-wave special events , more and more important since they started a decade ago , present their own kind of grief . Censorship is n't the chief trouble , being probably little worse for the brainstormer than for the newspaper correspondent . Radio men were agreeably surprised to see how much straight dope their European representatives could put . on the air during the recent crisis . At worst , the broadcaster could dodge by reading translations from the headlines of German papers about atrocities in Czechoslovakia and then drop in the casual comment that he personally had missed seeing anything like that ? in the regions mentioned . But other difficulties naturally arise from the fact that they do things differently over there . In covering processions , for instance . A big-time American network will install so many pickup points along the route of an inaugural parade in Washington that the presidential car is always in sight of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative is an intricate mosaic , made up of bits contributed on signal from each pickup point and managed from a central control board under the Capitol steps . English arrangements to cover the coronation of King George VI were also elaborate . They even had a microphone under the coronation . chair . But an American brainstormer , looking over the chart before the show , could not understand why there was a whole huge stretch of the procession route covered by no pickup points whatever . " Suppose somebody took a shot at the King along in there ? " he asked . " My dear fellow , " said the Englishman in charge , " that would be a matter for Scotland Yard , not for the broadcasting authorities . " When Mr. Roosevelt was good-will touring in South America , Columbia sent Paul White and H. V. Kaltenborn to cover his reception in Rio . Brazilian radio men were charmed to co-operate with the setup  --  one transmitting layout for Kaltenborn at the quay where the President would land and another for White in a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at his post that morning only to find that not a scrap of equipment had been installed . He got on the phone and shouted . There were apologies ; the equipment would be right along . So it was . But along with it came a frantic telephone call from Kaltenborn on the quay , asking why a crew of electricians had descended on him and robbed him of all his equipment . White persOnally escorted it back to the quay and returned to his own station . Another transmitting layout had arrived in the meantime . But it had been installed in a back room , with no view of the street at all . The smiling Latin in charge explained that there was a beautiful view of the mountains from the back windows , whereas nothing but the street was visible from in front . The resourceful Mr. White got the CBS broadcast of the President 's arrival on the air by finally extending the longest available cable from the back to the front of the building , with a microphone on the end of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the window , he had to bob back and forth from window to mike during the entire duration of the rejoicings down below . It gave him a stiff neck , of course , but he seems to have thought it cheap at the price . It is the memory of that sort of shenanigan that makes the brainstormer mourns when he suspects his job of turning into a sane routine . And makes the approach of television so important to his leather-wrapped , steel-cored nervous system . Television is starting right out in the old tradition of " almost anything may happen , and probably will . " A television crew , recently experimenting with long-range lens equipment , just happened to be focusing on Ward 's Island , in New York 's East River , when one of the worst fires of the year broke out there . Other such crews , fooling with their toys in midtown Manhattan , have also just . happened to catch two out-of-the-window suicides ; one of them the most spectacular New York ever saw .

Now they were checking over the details of a billboard campaign on Baby Malt , which Ned was to take to Valentine 's advertising manager in the afternoon . On big matters , Tony went himself , but this was a minor campaign . Ned had worked it out very ably according to Tony 's suggestions , but it was not brilliant . Tony remembered a month ago a similarly competent but uninspired campaign for the trade papers , which Ned had taken to the Valentine advertising manager for okay . It seems that while Ned and the advertising manager were discussing the campaign , Ned got a little idea which changed it in a flash from competent to brilliant .
