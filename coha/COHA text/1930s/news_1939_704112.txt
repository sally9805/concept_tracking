txt The announcement that Congress will be called hurriedly into special session should a war crisis develop in Europe between adjournment and the end of the year calls attention once more to the needless awkwardness of our legislative system . If Congress is called into special session for that or any other reason , what is likely to happen ? First , the date of assembly will probably have to be set for a certain time after the call , to allow some 531 members to arrive . These members will then be informed of the situation that confronts the country and will be requested to take this or that action . Their first move will be to refer the question to a committee for study . Meanwhile the great mass of Congress will be forced to sit around and  --  kill time . The present session of Congress began on Jan. 3 of this year . What was the situation a full month later ? On Feb. 2 Majority Leader Barkley moved adjournment of the Senate until the following Monday because there was " no business on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the remainder of the week . " He urged the various committees to speed their work " so that the Senate may not be required to adjourn from time to time for three days because there is nothing to do . " Nevertheless , two weeks after that a Washington dispatch to this newspaper read as follows : Neither the House nor the Senate has before it any pressing business . ... The Senate has literally no business of a national scope ready for debate and is in a position of meeting for a few minutes now and then and recessing while waiting for something to turn up . Yet a few weeks ago , at the end of June , Congress was working desperately in da.y and night sessions to pass new monetary and relief legislation before the " deadline . " It is small wonder that , in this haste , part of that legislation was ill-considered . With adjournment rapidly approaching now , it is probable , if the past is any guide , that bills will be feverishly passed , amended or killed amid a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions quietly and soberly nor permit the country to fix clear responsibility on individuals for what is done . Yet most of this gross inefficiency is needless , and could be cured by a simple step . In the last few years about a half dozen State Legislatures have selected from their own membership a small number of leaders as " legislative councils , " to be in more or less continuous session and prepare a comprehensive program to be submitted to the Legislature at its next session . The advantages of such a device , if adopted by Congress , would ebe obvious . It would save waste of what for the country might often be precious time . It would permit the President to keep in continuous touch with Congressional sentiment . It would permit him to keep Congressional leaders continuously informed of developments or situations that he regards as important or pressing . It would permit Congressional leaders , on their side , continuously to check and comment upon the actions of the Executive . Again , it would at once make poisible both greater cooperation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , because its own leadership would be more continuous and effective . It would give Congress more time to study proposed legislation . It would allow the country to know in advance what sort of legislation was going to be proposed , so that public opinion would have time to mobilize and crystallize for or against that legislation . If not only the proposed revision of the Wagner Labor Act but other important legislation goes over at this session , as seems probable , it would allow study of these questions to be carried forward between sessions . If a European crisis developed ; it would permit the President to get in immediate touch with . Congressional leaders and allow the country to know quickly the probable response of the full Congress to the President 's proposals . It would be a simple reform , in short , which Congress could make without constitutional change , and which would make our democracy far more efficient without sacrificing any of its safeguards or freedom .                 @ @ @ @
