White-robed Shinto priests purify War Minister-General-Count Juichi Terauchi by pouring holy water from a dipper over his hands before he goes in to pray for the Army ( see cut ) . Last week on his sole responsibility the pious count gave the Army its greatest shaking-up of all time , ordered promotions and transfers affecting 3,000 officers . This came as what Minister Terauchi hoped will be the last drastic step needed to restore the Army to subordination after part of it got out of hand last February , tried to murder the Premier and for a time defied the Emperor . With infinite patience General Terauchi has scrutinized the records of innumerable officers , trying to shift into key positions those of whose loyalty the Throne can be sure . <P> With some asperity last week Tokyo 's famed Nichi Nichi commented , " The War Minister has perhaps cultivated safety too much , searching for honesty rather than for strength of character . "
