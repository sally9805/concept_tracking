ODD JOHN - Olaf Stapledon - Button ( $2 ) . <P> Odd was the right word for John . An 11-months ' baby , he still looked like a foetus when he was born , had to be incubated . His parents soon found him a precocious handful , gradually came to the conclusion that John was a being superior to the normal . Because he needed money for his private schemes , he turned burglar at a tender age , committed his first murder at the age of 9 ( self-defense : the policeman had caught him red-handed ) . He sold many an invention , cleaned up in the stockmarket before he was well into his teens . Unwary adults , engaging him in conversation , wished they had not . John matured so fast and far that before he was adolescent he had outstripped all ordinary human beings . <P> Lonely , fearing he was the only one of his kind on earth , John went off to the Scottish Highlands to think things over . There he learned to live like a savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual stature . When he came back to civilization he was able to communicate telepathically with other superior human beings like himself . Most of the older ones were in insane asylums . But gradually John collected a motley little band of superior children , took them off to an uncharted Pacific island to found a real civilization . Before they could do much for the rest of the world their hiding place was discovered , and the colony came to a tragic end . <P> Readers whom pseudo-scientific thrillers make mad should not attempt Odd John . Those who like Jules Verne , Rider Haggard , the early H. G. Wells , may safely try it .
