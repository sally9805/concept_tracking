txt // local products and imports . The weekly market at the village of Chichicastenango , one of the great trade centers which draws thousands of visitors weekly , includes local producers of foodstuffs , local merchants with commodities like coffee or mats brought from other villages , regular visitors from nearby towns with their local products , and occasional traders from more distant towns with the produce of their own or other towns for which they serve as middlemen . These men dispose of the greater part of their stock to local merchants . They do not return empty-handed , but buy other objects , such as mats or bags , to sell at home , or else buy foodstuffs to sell at the railhead where they can purchase foreign wares such as steel knives and cotton yarn . Chichicastenango is a town of middlemen ; almost every man engages in trade for profit . The town is very wealthy , and most of this wealth is derived from trade . On the other hand the industrial towns of the area are poor . Within the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different villages . In addition each village has one large fair each year on the date of the feast of the patron saint ; these in important centers attract thousands of merchants from far and near . The market plays an important role in the social , political , and religious life ; it brings large numbers of people together and forms the necessary contrast to the rather disruptive and unsocial life on isolated farms. * Although the Central American market is formally open , there is little evidence of competition . Prices are set by custom . Every commodity increases in price with the distance from the source of supply . The roads are open to everyone , and everyone likes to use them . Moreover , there are supernatural sanctions against greed and sharp dealing , and fear of sorcery and the envy of others keeps prices moderate . Money is used in Central American markets , the usual money or moneys of the country . In pre-Columbian times the seeds of cacao served as a medium of exchange . But their perishable nature , their use as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions preclude their being classed as money . They st ill serve as valuables in ceremonial exchanges . War . One mechanism of intertribal economics still remains to he mentioned , war . Predatory warfare was an established part of the economy of many primitive peoples . Raiding for profit was the // characteristic economic relationship between the sedentary Pueblos and their nomadic neighbors . The popular picture is that of hordes of Navajo swooping down on the peaceable and defenseless Pueblos , and robbing them of their corn . But the reminiscences of elders indicate that the Zunis at least were no passive victims . Navajo who came to trade peaceably were treacherously killed and robbed , and when things became dull at home the Zunis went on the warpath with the avowed object of stealing Navajo sheep . After killing off all the inhabitants of a camp , they drove off the sheep . On returning home these were divided among the members of the war party , according to rank , and the rest were turned loose among the people . Warfare has been stopped and its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Zunis drive the hardest bargains . Ashamed of sharp practice at home , they delight in cheating the Navajo . ' " Warfare on the northern plains , while primarily for glory , had its economic side . The Crow raided systematically for horses , their favorite form of wealth , and a stolen horse was the only acceptable bride gift . Here , however , prestige outranked profit as a motive ; it was the exploit rather than the acquisition of the horse that was most important . The stealing of a horse under prescribed conditions was a recognized counter in the war-rank complex . Horses stolen on the warpath were generally given away , adding still another cubit to the prestige of the warrior.1 " On the other hand , the whole economic system of the Kiowa hinged upon warfare . Here also the objective was not food or valuables but horses , the instruments of production in their economy . With the development of buffalo-hunting and nomadic life large numbers of horses were necessary for comfortable existence . Each man required several fast , specially trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pack horses for carrying meat , tipi poles , etc . Furthermore , they accumulated wealth in the form of large herds of unbroken horses . A man acquired power by having horses to lend . In this way he could get poor relatives to hunt or raid for him . And he acquired prestige from giving horses away . The best and most honorable way to get horses was by raiding neighboring tribes and Mexicans . Certain seasons of the year were devoted to raiding ; parties sometimes stayed out for months and years and drove off large herds of horses . On such raids they killed only when necessary . They also took slaves and sold them to the Comanche.ro3 // Almost all North American tribes took captives in war , who were brought back as slaves and frequently adopted into the family of the captor . But for slave-raiding as the aim of war we must turn to West Africa . All the tribes of this region have slavery as an established and important economic institution , and warfare with the avowed purpose of capturing slaves has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raided the great kingdoms of the Guinea coast to take slaves to be sold to the North African tribes , and during the period of the American slave trade the tribes of the coast raided the inland peoples with similar objectives . But in addition to these great interracial movements the whole internal economy predisposes to this form of warfare . Among all African peoples women are the most valued economic assets . Women , as we have seen , are capital and build power for their owners , and throughout this part of Africa power rivalry is an important motive . Power built through women , polygamy which creates a shortage of women , the resulting high bride price and strong rivalry , have given special economic importance to the taking of female slaves in warfare . Such captive women become wives or concubines of their masters , and their children are free . In most parts of the world this is the only kind of slavery that is known . Throughout New Guinea the fact that a human victim can usually be substituted for a pig at a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims and some kill for food without ceremonial pretext has given a special coloring to their head-hunting . Or perhaps it is only the substitution of pigs for human victims that has kept these tribes from completely exterminating each other . There is no glory in Papuan warfare . The point is to kill in the safest and most economical fashion , and the usual pattern is to send out an expedition of some fifty warriors against a small isolated and defenseless settlement , or to waylay victims in the bush . In such raids the women and children are often taken as captives . Marriage with captive women and adoption of captive children is so widespread in parts of New Guinea that whole tribes , like the Plarind-Anim , are of mixed descent and sometimes even of mixed language . This fact adds still further complications to the whole head-hunting picture for this area . Head-hunting , adoption , and trade exist side by side between the same tribes . War for territorial expansion was relatively rare in the primitive world . It must have occurred in many places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only infer it from authenticated ; records of population movements such as we find in archaeological remains and from such complexities of social structure as those of the caste states of central Africa . Wars of this kind are very different from the desultory murdering and plundering by individuals or groups of individuals . The war party , even when organized under a leader with supernatural sanctions , is purely individualistic in aim ; persons go on war parties for individual honor or profit . Raiding for plunder can and does occur among people with any kind of social or economic structure . But wars of conquest involving whole populations can be carried out only by politically organized groups . It is not merely a question of the size of the undertaking which requires more extensive organization and stronger leadership . There is a difference of attitude . The men who go out to raid expect - to come back alive , and almost always do . The loss of life is among the passive defendants . In North America , at least , the leader who loses men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . But a war of conquest can not be fought without loss of life . There must therefore be an idea of a commonwealth for which men are willing to risk their lives , or an authority strong enough to compel them to do so  --  in short , a strong state . A strong state does not necessarily mean a large state . Some of the most outstandingly successful wars of conquest , such as the conquest of Mexico , have been waged by small groups of men with a fanatical singleness of purpose , mowing down unorganized or uncertain populations . Africa is the part of the primitive world that is characterized by strong political organization . It is not surprising , therefore , that wars of conquest have been waged among the native states of Africa from relatively early days down to the present . In early days there were undoubtedly great population movements ; the more recent wars have been waged over the point of extension of political power , which always means tribute to the ruler . One of the most interesting primitive wars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lau , Southeast Fiji , by a war expedition from Fiji proper some 150 years ago . A relatively small group of warriors conquered the islands , established themselves as a ruling class , and proceeded to acquire title to land by intermarriage with the indigenous population . This process is still going on . Among the Aztecs of ancient Mexico war was the most honorable // occupation and warriors formed a privileged caste . War formed one of the integrating factors of the Aztec state . The whole society was organized along martial lines , the various descent groups forming military units each under a war chief . War was waged with two objectives , tribute and captives . First coming into prominence in the thirteenth century as the boldest of the predatory nomads who preyed upon the civilized peoples of the valley of Mexico , the Aztec kings rapidly built up an empire on the Roman plan , which extended into Central America and included peoples of many languages and diverse cultures . To conquered peoples they extended protection a sort of pax Mexicana and from them they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicrafts , and precious metals . On this foundation was built up the magnificence of the court of the Montezumas whose splendor so excited the cupidity of the Spaniards , and which ultimately formed the economic basis of Spain 's age of glory . But in one respect the conquests of the Mexicans differed from those of any other people . The Aztecs had what is unquestionably the most bloodthirsty religion in all recorded history . The sun required human sacrifices , and blood had to be spilled in connection with all the cults for rain and fertility . To supply the victims for this charnel house the Aztecs waged merciless warfare on all their neighbors . The warriors who brought captives to the altars were upholding the supernatural power as well as the material prosperity of the empire . The Aztecs after they settled in the valley of Mexico had a sell ' - sustaining agricultural economy , handicrafts , and an elaborate system of trade . Warfare was the business of the warrior caste , and it supported the temple and the court , but not the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants , bees , and wasps , but nowhere and at no time has normal man lived alone . In discussing man 's social organization , it is necessary to differentiate that which is " natural " and that which is cultural . A glance at forms of social organization among animals lower than man shows that forms may be found which suggest certain analogies to our own social organization . And the animal world more or less permanent polygynous , polyandrous , or monogamous matings are found . Family organization occurs among certain insects and fishes and is familiar to all as existing among birds and the higher mammals . Of paramount interest are the complex ant colonies with a definite division of labor , where social classes , as workers , agriculturists , slaves , warriors , and even guests , each have a peculiar function in the state . A number of groups intermediate between the small family group and the large , highly organized state , such as the local group , herd , open and closed band with their proper leaders and sentinels , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which ( Amblyornis ) chooses for the dance a place which has a background of foliage , and decorates it with berries and flowers . Most remarkable is the fact that , as soon as the decorations wilt , they are replaced with fresh ones . Certain cranes perform dances which seem to be an expression of pleasure and are not made primarily for the sake of pairing . There are even certain rudiments of property . Insects , fishes , birds , and mammals choose particular areas for their homes and defend them against all corners . In fewer cases animals ( usually mammals ) appropriate articles for their individual use and feel ownership . It is still a moot question whether these developments are to be accounted for entirely by instinct , or whether in some cases there is actual proof of learning , or whether instinct and intelligence have combined to create a result which may be called tradition or culture . 409 // Birds change their songs by changing their environment . Examples of mammals learning complicated processes are common . The amount of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cases , too , where animals make original discoveries . Chimpanzees work out solutions for themselves . Knowledge may be cumulative . If birds build nests through sheer instinct , it can hardly be said that instinct alone accounts for the finish with which the nests of older birds are made . The nests of the younger inexperienced birds are adequate but untidy . The same is true of the little mouse ( Mus minutus ) . Examples like this show that these animals have by experience acquired skill . Whether virtuosity has been gained by irritation or practice is not important here . Accumulation of knowledge , however obtained , is pertinent . At the best , however , animals have amassed culture only in the weakest sense of the term . Man , on the other hand , has culture ; that is , a high development of material and spiritual life which is not the result of his biological inheritance or determined by his geographical environment . So as not to press the analogy of animal and human organization too far , several important facts should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wasps are not comparable to human states in that they are primarily assemblages of females , whereas all human groups are about equally ( theoretically ) divided as to sex . Another differentiation is the fact that most animals , except anthropoids , in a state of nature have restricted periods of sexual activity . In this respect man more closely resembles the domesticated animals . A third fundamental difference is that man , with few exceptions , has the same social groupings the year round , whereas animal groups may change according to seasons . Birds may live in family groups during the brooding season , and solitary or in unisexual flocks the rest of the year . Where seasonal changes occur in human groupings they are social , economic , or religious rather than biological . The clan groupings on the Northwest Coast of America are less important in the winter than new units centering in the winter ceremony . In South Africa men of fighting age are segregated for years to form military units . Various attempts have been made to classify social phenomena with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they occur . Dr. Lowie , in his discussion of subsistence ( Chapter VII ) , has pointed out the fallacy of economic determinism as an adequate cause for existing forms . // A more detailed study of animal sociology shows that classification even in this realm is not absolute . It shows too that social development does not necessarily parallel biological progress . The articulates have the most highly organized colonies of large populations . Monogamy , a form of marriage considered by many the peak of social achievement in the evolution of marriage types , ( is found among birds ( penguins , herons , guineas , gulls , parrots , ravens , many pigeons , ducks , cormorants , and others ) , among rhinoceri , and among the higher apes . Monogamy among these animals is sometimes temporary , although there is good evidence that it is permanent for some ostriches , cranes , swans , and geese . Some of these animals may not live in pairs the entire year . The male lives alone for a part of it and returns to the same female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish any kind of systematic sequence . The birds for which monogamy is most surely established are not by any means the highest biological forms , nor do they by any means belong to the same genera . Only a twisted evolutionary scheme would account for the rhinoceri between the birds and the apes . The case of animal polygyny is no clearer . Bark-beetles , semidomesticated pheasants ( wild forms are monogamous ) , the Indian buffalo , deer , antelope , wild sheep and goats , elephants , and certain apes have organized groups of one male and many females which are intolerant of intrusion by other males . Within the same families ( bees , ants , and wasps ) solitary species are found as well as highly social varieties . ' In the case of man many conditions other than the biological are important . Ile alone of all the animals possesses a complex culture . There is no evidence that emotional and moral elements enter into the social adjustments of ants . Certain emotions , such as jealousy , from which arises combativeness , are evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in human relations is there the complexity due to economic , social , political , and religious factors . To these the influence of geographical environment should be added in order to gain some notion of the probable diversities which may arise . It is in the infinity of possibilities resulting from a combination of such elements , most of which are uncontrollable , that the unpredictability of social phenomena lies . Family organization on different economic levels . The family consisting at least of parents and children is a universal social unit . All reasons which have been advanced for its necessity have their // vulnerable points . Some theorists consider the father 's care indispensable for the protection and upbringing of the children . Yet there are cases , in a society with matrilineal descent , where a woman with an independent income which she can keep up by her own efforts can and does raise a family without any assistance from the father or fathers of her children . If Malinowski 's summary 2 is correct , the Australian family could have existed on the labor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , some system of provision other than by family regulation is quite conceivable , as in all cases in which game is communally distributed . Protection also can be arranged by organization of men in military groups as it is in parts of South Africa . Hunting and war are male group activities , but family organization is not necessary to carry them on . The theory that marriage is necessary for sexual gratification is as weak as the theory that children must be helped and protected by their fathers . We have too many examples of satisfaction for the sexual impulse outside of marriage to consider this a sole reason for the establishment of the family . The reasons are probably deeply rooted . Since many of the animals have a family organization of some kind and since all men have it , it is perhaps the one social phenomenon which we are justified in calling " natural . " The form of the family does not depend primarily on economic conditions , for on various economic levels we find highly diversified forms of families . The Eskimo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " lowest " stage of cultural development . No two of these lower hunters and food-gatherers show similar types of social organization . The Eskimo have a small family unit but are generally considered examples of social anarchism . The Bushmen of South Africa have a definite system of child ownership . The child , in case of the father 's death , must be raised by the mother until adolescence . At that time he leaves his mother and goes to live with his father 's family . In this tribe there is a maternal obligation to bring a child safely to adulthood , and a privilege on the part of the father 's family to enjoy the benefit of the woman 's efforts . ' Such a combination of right and privilege does not result in a custom as simple as one would expect from the primitive Bushmen . It is difficult to find a more unfavorable geographical environment than that of the Australian . His economic condition is consequently exceedingly low , but his social organization is so complex // as to be the despair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phratries , and smaller units , but the principle of generation enters into all relationships and marriage restrictions and , as if that were not enough , there is a close relationship between economic life , social organization , and religion which manifests itself in the totem . A consideration of the " highest " stage of economic development , the sedentary agricultural level , reveals no closer orrelation . The horticultural Thonga of East Africa are strictly patrilineal ; the Pueblo gardeners of North America are as markedly matrilineal . It seems more profitable , then , in the face of the negative results of such attempts at classification , to analyze in a detailed manner the phenomena with which we are concerned , in order thus better to determine trends in development which , though they may not be absolute as are physical laws , may nevertheless give a truer picture of any particular culture and finally may result in more accurate generalizations . We are concerned in this analysis not only with form but also with the psychological attitude toward form as it occurs in a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers toward him is not the same in every tribe in which mother-in-law avoidance is found . This has an important bearing on our final conclusions . Present-day attitudes can not be expected to give us ultimate origins , the search for which is at best speculative , but they are certain to cause our speculations to run in a groove approaching truth . This discussion will proceed from a consideration of the smallest and most fundamental unit of social structure , the family , to the larger and less obvious groups , sib , association , phratry , moiety , etc . A series of groupings , gradually increasing in size , culminates in the state , which is occasionally found among the peoples we call primitive , but the most constantly used term is tribe . By a tribe we usually mean an economically independent group of people speaking the same language and uniting to defend themselves against outsiders . This is a definition which requires , as do all ethnological definitions , flexibility of meaning according to the part of the world where it is found . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are not economically independent . The Dobuans of New Guinea as a tribe comprise many hostile village groups which act as a unit only on rare and specific occasions . In general , however , this is a working definition . // A characteristic feature of the tribe is that it is a closed society . By this we mean that laws and morals apply only to its members . Strangers may not enter it on the same terms . The individuals composing it are " my " people and all others are " not mine . " There are specific rules of behavior for " my people . " Many of these are highly ethical . Killing a tribesman is murder ; butchering a neighbor of a different tribe may be of the highest religious importance to all my people . In Oceania many illustrations of this attitude may be found . Strangers may be sacrificed in dedicating a canoe or a house . None of our own moral ideas necessarily apply in our relation to other tribes . We , as a tribe , only twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they retaliated . Both " tribes " have as one of the articles of their moral code the commandment , " Thou shalt not kill . " The sib . The universal social unit is the family . In its narrowest sense the family consists of parents and children . Our own family is of this simplest type , but a family is not defined merely by membership at a given moment . In delimiting the confines of the family , descent must be known . Without it one could not determine to what family he belonged , as each of his parents belongs to a different one . We are accustomed to a bilateral organization , but many tribes consider a child as belonging only to one side , the father 's or the mother 's . Our family system reckons descent through the mother and father but with strong emphasis on patriliny . The man is still the head of the family . Inheritance is in the paternal line , although not exclusively , and there is always regret if , through lack of male heirs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means necessary . In many parts of the world a man belongs to his mother 's family and can not become a member of his father 's family . This type of descent is called matrilineal . There are also tribes which have strictly patrilineal descent so rigidly defined that a man may not be a member of his mother 's family . One-sided inheritance of position as a member of either the male or female line is what constitutes the unilateral family . Stich family groups are designated as clans or gentes . Neither term has , however , been used with consistency although some writers denote by the term " clan " a matrilineal unilateral family and by " gems " a patrilineal one . Since there is only confusion in the use of these terms it is perhaps better to call the unilateral family a sib . A sib has many more members than the restricted family . We shall // take as example a maternal sib since it differs more radically from our system than the paternal . The individuals belonging to a sib are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter 's ( laughter 's children , and so on ad infinitum . A marked difference between such a unit and ours is that a man gets his sib name , if the sib has a name , from his mother . Since his children also take theirs from their mother , it usually differs from their father 's because often members of the same sib are not allowed to intermarry . It is not at all unusual to find three , four , or even five generations of a family living in the same house , or at least in the same general locality . The reason is that primitives often marry young . For example , a girl , A , married at sixteen has a child , B , at seventeen . This child may in turn marry and have a child when her mother is only thirty-two , still bearing children . At the age of forty-eight , not yet past the age of child-bearing herself , A may be a greatgrandmother. , A simple illustration like this not only gives a conception of the increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say  --  but it also shows how a child of B may have as his contemporaries and playmates in his own family his uncles and aunts , or great-uncles and great-aunts , thus extending the family horizontally . Grouping by residence gives a certain view of sib membership , although not a complete one . The individuals who live together or in close proximity will differ according to the type of residence customary with the tribe . Sometimes newlyweds establish an independent home ; sometimes the woman goes to live at the man 's home , iii which case residence is said to be patrilocal . In other cases the man comes to live with the bride 's people , and residence is termed matrilocal . If we consider sib membership within a residence group in which residence is matrilocal , we may find conditions approximately like the following . A woman , X , of the sib Lone Tree , lives at a certain place . She has married a man of Folded Arms sib who lives with her . They have children , all Lone Trees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibs and their husbands live with them . The members of one such household may therefore represent a number of sibs . On the other hand , the sons of X have married women who also belong to other sibs and have gone to live with the families of t heir wives . All the women of this particular house consequently are Lone Trees , as are also the children , but all the men have other sib // names . Thus grandparents , parents , children , and perhaps uncles , aunts , and cousins may all be living in one house and acting as a family unit ; yet not all are members of the same sib . Within our own experience the intimacy between relatives more remote than parents and children is more variable because our family group is more restricted . There may be a further extension of this already large family . Among the group of playfellows there may be adopted children  - -  adopted because the mother has died , or because the adopting family lacks an heir . In many parts of the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , for instance , in many parts of Melanesia , on the Northwest Coast of America , and in other places where stress is laid on rank or property and where the lack of an heir is looked upon as the direst tragedy ; or in Africa where children are an economic asset . Children adopted under such circumstances are treated as own children , and it may even be considered an insult to refer to the fact that a particular child was not born into the sib whose name it bears . Although the extension of the family may be illustrated along the lines of the residence group , such a unit is not exactly or completely a sib . Only some of the members of a sib live in such a group ; others are to be found elsewhere , for the sib may be large and , in a sense , an abstract conception . Except under circumstances depending on other factors , such as moiety organization , endogamy , and the like , which must be considered in their turn , there may be other families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a group may feel such a close relationship that they use the same kinship terms in addressing one another as we do members of the same family : sister , brother , uncle , grandfather , and the like , whether actual blood relationship is traceable or not . The terms " matriarchate " and " patriarchate " are sometimes used for maternal and paternal sibs . They are misleading because , throughout all our history , the term " patriarchate " has a special significance . It has been used not only for tribes having patrilineal descent but for that group of people over which some old and powerful leader or sib head , the patriarch , has final control , even to the power of life and death . The Hebrew patriarchs come instantly to mind . Patriarchate is not only a social order ; it is also a system of government . If then , we use the term " matriarchate , " we think by analogy of a society ruled over by a woman , a matriarch , who ham // equal power over the individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case where this condition prevails . Cases where women are " the power behind the throne " are not rare , but it is not easy to find tribes where they are absolute rulers , even though matriliny is found extensively in all the major land divisions . I shall be content , then , with the more accurate term " maternal sib . " In some cases the sib may be composed of lineages  --  that is , unilateral families believing they are descendants of a common ancestor . This is the case among some Californian tribes 4 and among the Ilopi , i for example . More commonly , however , especially in large tribes , the conditions are as if all Smiths in the United ( States should consider themselves relatives of all other Smiths whether they have common ancestry or not . Concomitant with this attitude is usually the belief that it would not be " good " for a Smith to marry a Smith . It would be " better " for him to marry a Jones or a MacCarthy . When marriage within a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exogamous . Exogamous sibs are found in all the important world quarters . Some sibs are endogamous ; that is , they require marriage within the group . The rightness of sib endogamy was expressed by the scorn of the Bella Bella of the Northwest Coast of America who said , " Who ever heard of a Raven marrying an Eagle ? " in contrasting their own custom with that of their exogamous northern neighbors , the Tsimshian . The Navajo like to create friendliness between sibs by marrying many members of one sib to individuals of another . This seems to come about quite naturally . Some time after a Lone Tree man has married a holded Arms girl , her brother may look for a wife . If her husband 's sister is available the problem is nicely settled , and the sibs become doubly friendly . If the husband has no sister , his mother 's sister may have a daughter whom she is willing to let the Folded Arms man have as a wife , and the affiliation between the two sibs is strengthened . The friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regard in which all members of the father 's sib are held . A Navajo , meeting an entire stranger for the first time , may give up a choice possession upon learning that he is a member of his father 's sib . Although the Navajo are always hospitable , hospitality is exaggerated in the case of individuals having relationship reckoned through the father . Instead of friendship there may be conflict between sibs . In parts // of Melanesia , where the pattern is one of suspicion and distrust , there may be antagonism between the wife 's sib and the husband 's . ' This may be the case even if the wife and husband live together in perfect accord . Sibs may own property of all kinds . On the Northwest Coast of America sibs own rights to use certain crests and myths which explain their relationship to supernatural beings . ' Zuni households which are subdivisions of the sibs own the house which the members call home . ' Privilege to use land among the IIidatsa was owned by the sib , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his membership in a sib . All Hopi ceremonies are held in trusteeship within a sib . " The Todas of India have , to an exaggerated degree , combined religious functions with the sib . Some of the buffalo herds are sacred ; others are common or profane . Each of the Toda sibs has specific duties and privileges in connection with the elaborate rites of the buffalo dairy , and each is entitled to respect according to the degree of sacredness of these duties . " In parts of Australia the sib has economic as well as religious functions . It is the duty of the sib to increase by the performance of magic that part of the food supply over which it has control , for the benefit of the rest of the community . The Kangaroos are not allowed to eat kangaroo , but they perform elaborate ceremonies to provide kangaroos for the Witchetty Grubs and the Emus . The Witchetty Grubs and Emus reciprocate by magically increasing the witchetty grub and emu supply for the other sibs . " One of the most important activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffalo hunt . The pursuit of buffalo entailed the moving of the tribal population , for the buffalo grounds were far frolll the more permanent villages . In a region where war and horsestealing were esteemed there was a strong need for protection . Sibs in some tribes had the honor and the duty of policing . The tribe set up tipis in the form of a camp circle with the entrance usually ( theoretically at least ) toward the east . The tipis at either side of the opening to the camp circle belonged to the police sibs . Their prime duty was to watch the camp and , if danger threatened , to call a council of wise men to plan a defense or an attack . These sibs not only had temporal power but were of special import a i we because of supernatural power which they possessed from their nano ' and tradition . // The functions controlled by the sib vary greatly the world over . They may be social , religious , economic , or political . Up to this time we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now illustrate sib relationships from the viewpoint of a few of the members belonging to it . The first to be considered are the father and the mother 's brother . In a maternal sib the father does not leave his wealth to his own children , but is rather the guardian of his sister 's children , who may expect to inherit from him . IIe may have the final say as to whom his sister 's children shall marry . Since a payment is commonly made to the bride 's family , the amount and settlement are made by the bride 's maternal uncle . The importance of the mother 's brother in the economic and social life of the maternal sib should not lead us to think that children living in this sort of society do not love their fathers , or that the fathers do not love them . There is no necessary correlation between father-love and inheritance . Fathers in these societies may fondle and teach their children ; indeed , the men of the Trobriand Islands of Melanesia take pride in attending to the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organization which exaggerates the importance of the maternal uncle in family affairs is called the avunculate . Where it is found , children may be particularly fortunate in that they have two fathers : their actual father , who plays with them , teaches them his techniques and lore , takes them hunting or visiting and is , in general , a fine adult companion ; and the uncle who , because of his social and economic obligations to his sister 's children , sees to it that they learn the lessons of the tribe and grow up to be responsible men and women . There is a degree of overlapping of social contacts and teachings of father and maternal uncle , especially if the latter lives near his sister 's children . The social machinery does not always run smoothly . In the Trobriand Islands there is sometimes a conflict between father-love and avuncular duties . A man may become so fond of his son that he wishes to give him his most cherished possessions , which , according to tribal custom , he should give to his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important of a man 's possessions . There is a belief that just a certain amount of each kind of magic exists . Consequently it must be used as a whole ; it can not be divided . Therefore , if a man knows magic , he can not teach some to his sister 's son , to fulfil legal requirements , and some to his own son , to satisfy his // parental emotions . If he chooses his son for his favors , his sister 's son may disgrace him by publicly accusing hint of running counter to custom . " The avunculate is by no means restricted to matrilineally organized tribes . Among the Thonga of Southeast Africa there is pronounced patriliny . Wives go to live in the husband 's village , and children are thought of as the property of the father 's village . However , the mother 's village is a secondary haven for a man . He may be sent there as a young child and be practically raised by his mother 's people . Later he may stay for long visits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle there upon marrying . For among the Thonga , as in many parts of Africa , all individuals are looked upon as village acquisitions , and a man 's male relatives would ridicule or even censure him for choosing to " increase " his mother 's village . Together with the strongest kind of patriliny and patrilocal residence there is , nevertheless , a strongly developed avunculate . The maternal uncle of a Thonga child should prepare the first soft skin in which it is wrapped . He claims a right to a part of the betrothal payment made for his sister 's daughter . As the head of the child 's maternal family , he provides also certain bridal equipment ; he may be required to make sacrifices for his sister 's child . He has special duties at the time of mourning , and he has the right to " renew his village . " That means that if he has no children he may , instead of negotiating a marriage for- his sister , refuse the betrothal gift . IIe will then take the responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a promise , and the sister will have lovers . Any children which are the fruit of her relationships will belong to his village because he has refused the bride price . Thus is the continuance of the line made secure . ' If the uncle under the avunculate has duties , correspondingly the nephew has privileges . In many of the South Sea islands there are no restrictions whatever in the treatment by a nephew of his maternal uncle 's possessions . Such freedom of behavior may amount to destruction of property or abuse of privilege without calling down upon the abuser any punishment whatsoever . Junod cites the example from Africa of an uncle 's anger at finding food upon which he had depended all eaten . However , just as soon as someone explained that his sister 's son had eaten it he smiled and made no more to-do.18 This is an example of what has been called the joking relationship , of which we shall have more to say later . It obtains // between maternal uncle and nephew in many parts of the world but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the larger family groups the relationship of a child to his mother 's sister may be as close as that to his mother . One reason for this may be matrilocal residence , and another may be the sororate . This term defines the custom of a man marrying more than one sister of a family . If he has more than one wife at a time , it often happens that the wives are sisters . The sororate may also prevail in monogamous tribes . In such case a widower marries his deceased wife 's sister and she may bring up her sister 's children as if they were her own . An expression of this relation is found in many kinship systems in which " my mother " and all her sisters are addressed by the same kin term , so that any one of them is really " a member of the group of sisters to which my mother belongs " ( see page 454 ) . If , from earliest childhood , I live in close contact with four or five women and address them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and care , it is unlikely that I shall regard one quite differently from the others . If I do , it is not necessary that my favorite be my actual blood mother . The idea of absolute motherlove is an exaggeration of our own culture . There are many cases where a mother 's sister , a foster mother , or even a neighbor is regarded more fondly by a child than his real mother . Primitive society gives no proof of the stepmother idea as a natural human characteristic . On the contrary , it shows by attitudes of different relatives toward children and toward adoption that ours and other similar attitudes are based on particular prejudices not founded on biological instincts that unite parents and children . In our own society the relationship between cousins depends almost entirely upon rapport between families and upon where they live . Among primitives residence is of even greater importance when it is matrilocal or patrilocal  --  that is , markedly one-sided , as opposed to the setting up of an independent home by a newly married couple . If residence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and under ordinary circumstances mothers ' brothers ' children and the children of fathers ' sisters and brothers do not see one another so frequently . If residence is patrilocal , the children of brothers have more intimate contact than the others . In dealing with the relationships and attitudes of primitive peoples it is necessary to distinguish two kinds of cousins . Since // English has no general word to indicate sisters and brothers , we shall use the term " siblings . " The children of my mother 's sisters , and those of my father 's brothers , are my parallel cousins , so-called because the parents through whom we are related are siblings of the same sex . If we were related through parent siblings of opposite sex we should be cross cousins . In other words , my parallel cousins are children of my mother 's sisters and of my father 's brothers ; my cross cousins are the children of my mother 's brothers and of my father 's sisters . Parallel cousins are often treated as brothers and sisters . They address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them exactly as if they were blood siblings . Cross cousins are considered a different kind of relative . Whereas the behavior of parallel cousins of opposite sex toward one another may savor of avoidance , especially as they grow up , it is not unusual to find a joking relationship between cross cousins . This behavior will be further discussed under the titles of avoidance and joking ( see page 446 ) . We may recall that the extended family includes individuals of two , three , or even four generations . Grandparents are often useful and productive members of the primitive family . Perhaps this is true because they are nearer the age of their descendants than grandparents in our own society . Old people may , however , be respected merely because old age is honorable . Because he is old a man has wisdom and judgment which can come only through long experience ; hence his counsels should be regarded . The same argument may apply to old women . Treatment of the aged is by no means uniform in different parts of the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burden . There are tribes , too , in which neither extreme is the case , but grandmothers have their duties just as do the younger individuals . Mohave grandmothers * conduct " nursery schools " while their daughters pursue their " careers . " One sees an old woman tending a row of babies , her charges , while their mothers are at work in the fields or away from home . One Mohave woman , upon being asked why she had no children , replied , as if the answer were self-evident , " But how could I ? The child has no grandmother to bring it up ! " Primitive family organization is not by any means always unilateral . Since we are more familiar with the bilateral family , it will be sufficient to emphasize by a few examples the fact that even // lateral inheritance need not be like ours . Among the Ashanti of the west coast of Africa there is a peculiar and interesting type of descent.l " It can be explained only by dividing heritable property into material and spiritual . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( blood particularly is important ) , property , and succession from his mother . From his father he inherits spiritual wealth , ntoro , which includes soul , health , power , and success . There are few societies in which inheritance is not important ( see below ) . Wealth is passed . down through one line or through both , and the privileges which it may provide differ greatly . Where a sense of high nobility is developed , good birth giTes a man a running start in life which nothing else can equal . The inheritance a man or woman can pass on to their children depends upon the rules of the society in which they live . Certain tribes of the Northwest Coast of America , for example , have sib exogamy . They reason , almost certainly ex posteriori , that a man can give his children a better heritage if he marries a woman of another unilateral family who is as wealthy or nearly as wealthy as he . Another tribe in the same region has sib endogamy , and reasons that marriage within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . So exaggerated has the latter reasoning become in special cases that members of very noble families can find no other family of sufficiently high nobility , and occasionally men are urged to marry their half-sisters . The ancient Peruvians and Egyptians sometimes sanctioned marriages between full siblings to retain inherited nobility in the line . Among the Loango of the Congo region nobility is developed , but it is not hereditary . There is alternation of class with matrilineal descent . A king must take a commoner for a wife , and their children are commoners . If the power ever comes back into the king 's family it is a matter of accident . On the other hand a princess takes a commoner for a husband , and their children will be nobles . The explanation given for this state of affairs is that all princesses are considered sisters of the king , and for that reason could not marry him.20 This case illustrates nicely the extension of exogamic rules to include all members of the noble sibs , whether actual blood relatives or not , and demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ancient Egyptians and Peruvians . The custom of destroying a man 's property at his death is widespread . Where it exists there is no need for inheritance rules applied to material possessions . At the same time , however , rights to fishing 4Q4 GENERAL ANTHROPOLOGY grounds , fields  --  in short , the use of nature 's gifts  --  may be passed down according to formal requirements . During the course of this discussion we have seen that many types of family organizations are possible , from the highly extended unilateral family to the small , loose , simple family group like that of the Eskimo or our own , and that they have no necessary connection with cultural level . It can not be shown that one form is necessarily derived from one of the others . The data do not justify the assumption so often made that the family developed from early promiscuity to matriliny until finally the pinnacle , patriliny , our type of organization , was reached . An examination of the facts shows that there are no tribes , however rude economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that man ever existed without the family . The argument freely advanced , that the matrilineal family was the first orderly arrangement , is based on the assumption that everyone knows who his mother is , but may never be certain of his father . An answer to this is the example of certain Australian tribes who , without any interest in the function of the father in procreation , nevertheless have a strongly developed family with paternal descent.21 Even among them the father is considered necessary , as it is put , " to open the woman . " The Eskimo 22 believe that the child crawls up the bootlace and into the womb of a woman , but the semen is necessary to " feed the child . " The proof for unilinear evolution from promiscuity to patriliny through definite stages would require evidence showing that , wherever change in historical times is found , the development was in this direction . Such a development would be " natural . " Cases where there has been a change from matriliny to patriliny are few . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the change may be detected . The Trobriand Islanders show several weak signs of transition from matriliny to patriliny . Inheritance of land , privilege , and material goods is in the mother line , and some of these may be enjoyed by a man during the lifetime of his mother 's brother , provided he pays for them . Nevertheless a man occasionally bestows such right of use and enjoyment upon his own son gratis . Upon the death of the father the son must return the property to his maternal cross cousins , so that the change from favoritism of the female line to that of the male line is so far only an emotional one obtaining in // certain families , and not one which enjoys tribal sanction.23 It is not difficult to imagine that this tendency might be emphasized and tolerated so frequently as to change a social structure . If that should happen certain rationalizations of incompatibility between the two basic ideas would have to be made , some of which might seem to fall into ready-made categories of an evolutionary scheme . The natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this in face of the fact that they deny the part played by the father in procreation . Malinowski 's presentation of this material suggests that the situation may be viewed as an outgrowth of a pose protesting ignorance of the father 's function in procreation . If it is that , it is not difficult to understand the exaggerations and affirmations of the natives about fatherhood , or the social instead of the biological importance of the father in the tribe . Formal protestations of the same kind are common indeed in native explanations of social usage . The other example of a possible change being made between matriliny and patriliny , although it has taken place in the direction opposite that posited by the evolutionists , is more convincing because it is further advanced than the Trobriand condition and the details of its cause are more positive . The Kwakiutl Indians of the Northwest Coast of America have , within historical times , taken over certain aspects of matriliny which show themselves to be adjustments to a patrilineal system.2 " The Kwakiutl rightly fit into the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so doing have bilateral descent with favor on the paternal side . They have , however , been thrown into intimate contact with their neighbors to the north , who are markedly matrilineal . Accordingly , among the Kwakuit a nice adjustment has been made whereby a man acquires certain types of rank and wealth from his wife 's father . They are given to him in trust and he transmits them in his turn to his daughter 's husband . In the north a man inherits from his mother 's side directly . Altogether the Kwakiutl case shows a meeting of two principles due to geographical contiguity and an adjustment to make both fit in . A view of the prevailing types of family structure , including many more examples than we are able to cite here , shows that there is no " natural " basis for unilinear development ; that when it prevails , some kind of conflict , economic , sociological , or psychological , also exists , making it necessary for the group to rationalize their behavior // or modify the structure in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-sided group which must adjust itself somehow to the demands of mother 's and father 's relatives . The Trobrianders give the father social compensation for the assumed deprivation of biological function , although they would certainly never put it this way , and are not conscious of the fact . The Kwakiutl have made formal adjustments between the mother 's and father 's lines based , as is to be expected here , on the transference of wealth from one generation to another ; and with all the social machinery , there are constant quarrels about individual cases . The Navajo , who have retained their unilateral view of inheritance , have made the compromise of friendliness with the father 's relatives so that they almost bend over backward in compensating the paternal line socially for what it may seem to lose economically ; and because of this compromise , as well as because of the tolerance of individualism in this tribe , the type of social conflict here discussed is absent . Totemism . A unilateral kin group often has the name of some animal , plant , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Turquoise , Water , Sun , Cloud , are a few examples . Associated with the name is often the feeling on the part of the sib members that there is some special relationship between them and the animal whose name they bear . This relationship is sometimes a belief in direct descent from the totem animal . Tribes of the Solomon Islands and others of Australia hold such beliefs . In other cases , as on the Northwest Coast of America , there is a myth or tradition accounting for a supernatural experience which a remote ancestor had with an animal or some natural phenomenon . In the northern part of this region there is no belief in actual descent , and it may even be that the name and the supernatural with whom the ancestor was concerned are not the same . The Raven sib of the Ilaida , for example , has the killer whale as a crest animal , and among the Eagles of the same tribe the beaver is as important as the eagle . " Closely connected with belief in totemic experience is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many kinds . On the Northwest Coast they are patterns which some members of particular sibs are allowed to use . These designs of a symbolic and artistic nature may be painted or carved on totem poles , houses , posts and doors , or ceremonial paraphernalia , or they may be tattooed on the body.2 " No one would think of using a crest which does // not belong to him . Usually he inherits it , but there are other ways of obtaining the privilege of use , as by marriage or by gift . The possession of a coat-of-arms by a kinship group is not confined to America . In Melanesia a very elaborate type of openwork carving has developed . Certain carvings are erected in honor of the dead . Many of the designs are artistic or religious , but all the memorial carvings must include the totem ' animal , which is often a bird.27 The Omaha of the Plains area had a most unusual type of crest . It consisted of a right to cut the hair of a child in a peculiar fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair except a ridge which stood up from the forehead to the nape of the neck . This . was said to symbolize a buffalo 's back as it stood up against the sky . Another sib shaved the head but left four square tufts , one gat the forehead , one at the nape , and one at either side above the ears . This cut had reference to the eagle with which the sib felt itself connected . These peculiar crests were unusual in that they were exhibited only by the young children ; adults wore the hair long and in the more usual hairdressings found among Indians.23 The name , crest , and supernatural relationship of men to the nonhuman world may characterize a kin group . Closely connected with all these elements may be also the presence of a taboo . Most frequently it forbids members of the group to kill or eat the animal whose name they bear . Members of a certain Australian Emu totem , although performing ceremonies for the purpose of increasing the emu supply , must never eat it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them eat it 29 Frequently taboos concern activities other than eating . In the Santa Cruz group there is a Grass sib which may not walk on grass , and a Bowl sib which may not eat out of a bowl.30 A taboo against touching certain objects characterizes the Omaha sibs , although there are also restrictions against killing and eating . One sib is not allowed to touch the horn of a buffalo , another is prohibited from touching the unborn young of an animal , and to a third it is forbidden to touch charcoal or verdigris . Still another would avoid contact with creeping insects , bugs , worms , and similar creatures 31 Exogamy may be connected with a totemic sib as well as with any other kind , but there is no special necessity for it to be so . The Bella Coola sibs were endogamous although they have many totemic features . Almost any of the features and functions of the unilateral kin // group may characterize the totem . When they are the same , sib and totem are identical , as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have totemistic features , even though it be exogamous . On the other hand , groups whose members do not consider themselves kin may show many of the manifestations which have been assigned to totemism . Certain Australian totems , for example , consist of individuals who reckon their totem from the place where their mothers believe them to have been conceived . Totem spirits , which may also be called ancestor spirits , are believed to inhabit particular localities . When a woman passes one of these the spirit may impregnate her , and her child will belong to the totem named for that spirit . Such a social group is consequently composed of fortuitously selected individuals . It may be considered as a horizontal rather than a vertical section as is the sib . Except for its composition it has the characteristics of the sib , such as an animal name and belief in descent from the animal . Sometimes it has also its functions  --  such as the obligation to perform a ritual to increase the supply of the name-animal , with an attendant taboo against eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totem manifestation , but rather as a factor belonging to a larger group . Another type of non-kinship horizontal grouping is the society , association , or lodge . Groups of this sort are determined in a variety of watts . There are societies composed of men ( or women ) of approximately the same age . Payment of a large amount of valued goods may be the membership requirement . Where this is the case , as in Melanesia , the higher degrees are enjoyed by older men , as they are more likely to be wealthy , even as in our own society . In other regions , such as the North American Plains and South Africa , associations are composed of men of military prowess and they may or may not have military duties . Whatever the method of selection , most of the factors mentioned for the totem may be present . Associations almost always have names ; frequently they are animal names . They likewise may consider their relationship to animals close . The Leopard societies of West Africa and the medicine societies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in close rapport with these animals . Practically all associations have some symbol of membership which may be called a crest , be it a headdress , possession of a mask , or a scar received at initiation . Taboos are also // common . They may be killing or eating taboos and may or may not involve the animal believed to be related . The African secret societies , as well as the Melanesian and Pawnee , to mention only a few , all have the performance of ritual as one of their chief functions ; still the purpose of that ritual differs in every case . Although in primitive society women 's societies are not entirely lacking , they are nevertheless fewer than the men 's , as well as much less powerful . They are often imitations of men 's associations , for in each community where they occur their functions are of the same pattern , the essential difference between societies and totem groups being that the former are divided along sex lines , thus . ruling out any question of exogamy . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case among the Crow Indians . In this tribe the Foxes and Lumpwoods are rival military societies . There is a certain time every spring during which a member of either society may kidnap the wife of one of his rivals provided she has once been his mistress . There are social features of this kidnapping which may be regarded as rules of a game , one being that a man thus deprived of his wife must exhibit the greatest indifference . If he takes her back he not only disgraces himself but he may cause the entire society to become prey to its rival This peculiar situation shows that , even though association groupings along sex lines rule out the possibility of exogamy , they are not necessarily barred from making marital or sexual stipulations . The so-called totemic characteristics do not attach themselves to associations and kinship groups alone , but even to individuals . They often have names similar to totem names . Many individuals have crests , symbols which they regard as peculiarly theirs and effective in one way or another . Not infrequently they believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pursuit of the vision or the attainment of the guardian spirit in North America is a religious custom which might give rise to any of these peculiarities . " Individuals , likewise , often have taboos and set up rituals for themselves which have a purely personal significance . These brief facts , chosen from a large body of similar ones , show that the manifestations which are often called totemic do not belong to a kinship group any more than to a group constructed on other lines , or to an individual . It is quite conceivable that a personal idiosyncracy , like the // avoidance of a certain kind of food , may in a given family become habitual and acquire some kind of additional significance . A strong individual may well communicate his peculiarities and beliefs regarding them to his fellows , his kin , or associates in a closely knit association of some other type . I have used this simple example to show how any one of the phenomena called totemic may attach itself to any kind of group either in combination with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or quite independently . Too much has been written of totemism in its different aspects , and the catchwords " totem , " " totemic , " " totemism , " have been used too often to permit leaving it entirely out of the discussion . Frazer , 34 Durkheim , n Lowie , 36 Goldenweiser , 37 and Boas " have discussed the matter exhaustively from a religious and social point of view . In my opinion the discussion must be taken finally to conclude that , since the manifestations are so varied in different parts of the world , since their resemblances are only apparent , and since they are phenomena which may occur in many settings not related to real or supposed consanguinity , they can by no means be fitted into a single category . Marriage . Every individual secures a definite status by reason of his birth . He is a slave or a noble according to the standing of his mother or father in the community ; a Lone Tree or Bitter Water according to the name of his mother or father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is marriage . In primitive society the individual concerned has not much influence over his or her marriage . It is rare to find a tribe where romantic love is appreciated , and still rarer to find one where absolute freedom of choice is allowed . Even where love is valued and theoretic freedom of choice prevails , that freedom is not often actual . In our own society , where we boast of such freedom , the percentage of cases where a man or , even more so , a girl marries the mate he or she really wants is low . Family desires , position , success , social stratification , relative wealth , and other considerations weigh more heavily than free choice . In primitive societies it is common to find an attitude toward love or passion that is very different from , and often unrelated to , the marriage state . Motives other than that of sexual gratification lie behind marriage , and of these motives the most common is economic . // Two families unite by the intermarriage of one or more sons and daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony , but such ceremony does not by any means complete the manifold obligations assumed by both sides . Exogamy and endogamy . Before we can discuss the various points related to this matter it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the terms " exogamy " and " endogamy . " These two terms may be defined most simply as meaning " marrying out " and " marrying in , " respectively . We have family exogamy , for there is no general approval of marriage between close relatives ; in other words , individuals must marry " out of the family . " There is a strong reeling of preferential endogamy among orthodox Jews and Catholics ; in these cases it is felt that one should marry " in the religion . " Certain families are opposed to their children marrying any but Americans ; this is " national endogamy . " The terms may be applied to groups of various kinds : kin groups , religious groups , political groups . There is as much variety among primitive peoples , but the convention of marrying in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact common , to have exogamy and endogamy in the same tribe . Many peoples discourage marriage with outside tribes and are therefore tribally endogamic . At the same time , however , they may have class , phratry , or sib exogamy . The Todas of India illustrate this condition . The tribe is divided socially into two parts . When there is a twofold division of a tribe we refer to each division as a " moiety . " The number of individuals belonging to each is not necessarily equal . One of the Toda moieties considers itself superior to the other and has definite and important religious functions . The moieties are endogamic ; therefore , each member must marry within his own moiety ; but the moieties are composed of a number of paternal sibs , and these sibs are strictly exogamic . If I , for instance , am a member of moiety 1 and of sib A , I must marry a member of moiety 1 who is not of sib A. I could choose an individual whom we may call 1B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sib . Eorms ofmarriage . The particular form of marriage permitted or demanded is not always the same . There are only a few possible forms , and this undoubtedly accounts for similarities in many parts of the world . Our discussion does not concern itself with unrestricted intercourse between the sexes before marriage , which is permitted among some tribes , or with breaches of sanctioned forms of marriage , which occur everywhere . There is a great difference between // sanctioned form and actual practice . Our own society with a pretense at absolute monogamy but with its attendant promiscuity is a good example . In one form of marriage a group of men may marry a group of women , sexual relations being restricted to the members of the two groups . This form is called group marriage . When a man or woman has more than one mate , the marriage is said to be polygamous . Polygamy exists in one of two forms : when a woman has more than one husband it is called polyandry ; when a man has more than one wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only one wife at a time , the form of marriage familiar to us and called monogamy . Of all these types of marriage the rarest is group marriage . The best example exists side by side with polyandry and polygyny and is , in fact , an extension of these forms . The Todas of India formerly practiced polyandry to a great extent . When a woman married a man it was understood that she should be the wife of all . his brothers . Any children born to the woman considered as their father the man w ho performed the so-called " bow " ceremony with the woman . This man was ordinarily the eldest brother . It was customary for the second eldest brother to perform the ceremony after two or three children had been acknowledged by the eldest , but the man was the " father " of all the children born to a woman until she went through the ceremony with another man . So highly formal has the system finally become that a male born years after a ceremonial father has died considers him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his social father by means of the ceremony . This is another example where form has overcome all interest in actual fatherhood , the fixing of fatherhood for social purposes being the significant feature . A change in the Toda form of marriage has occurred within historical times for a sociological reason . In former times female infanticide was practiced . Since the British occupation of Toda territory , it has decreased to a great extent . The result has been an increase in the number of women in proportion to men and the development of a kind of group marriage . A group of brothers now marries a group of sisters . When a man takes a wife she is considered the wife of his brothers also , and the group of brothers have marital rights to her sisters as well . Rivers prefers to call the system one of combined polyandry and polygyny.39 There is some indication of group marriage in Australia , but the // evidence is so highly problematical that we can merely refer to the possibility of its existence there . Polyandry is a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several continents , in Africa , Madagascar , in southern India  --  Toda polyandry is probably to be explained as a part of this area in Tibet , among the Eskimo of North America , and among the Pawnee and some other tribes of the Plains of North America . Altogether , however , polyandry is not a common form of marriage . Polygyny , the marriage of a man to more than one woman , is common in many parts of the world . It is not restricted to any particular economic stage . There is every reason to believe that the Navajo and Apache of the Southwest were as polygynous when they were food-gatherers as they are at the present time when the Navajo , at least , are primarily pastoral . The Eskimo hunters are polygynous , as are pastoral tribes in Asia and agricultural tribes in Asia , Africa , and America . It is difficult for us , with our ideals of fidelity and our belief in jealousy as an " innate " or " natural " trait , to realize how groups of women can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one woman . The example of the Todas shows that it is not only possible but quite satisfactory if the mental twist is different from that to which we are accustomed . The Navajo have an extended notion of fidelity . In earlier times , a woman expected her husband to desire another woman , especially if she herself were sexually inactive because of illness , pregnancy , or old age . Instead of behaving jealously she sought for him a younger woman  --  if possible , from her own sib ; if not , from an affiliated or friendly sib . Fidelity was not absolutely lacking . There were cases where a man remained faithful to one wife for many years , sometimes for life , but the idea of faithfulness could be extended to include two or three wives . The reasons for the development of the different types of family are obscure . Polygamy , although common , seems to be due to different causes . The theory that it is due to differences in sex ratio is difficult , if not impossible , to substantiate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes . The Todas , who practice polyandry , have produced a lack of women through female infanticide . It is gratuitous to claim that this custom was introduced to support polyandry or that polyandry is its consequence . The prevalence of polygyny among the Eskimo is neatly explained // by the theorists who proclaim the dangers of Eskimo life as the cause for high male mortality . It is easy then to argue that since more women survived , a man must care for more than one . If this is accepted , polyandry of the Eskimo should be explained on the same grounds . Since life is so rigorous a woman must have more than one husband to care for her and her children . One argument cancels the other . Infanticide , too , has been attributed to economic causes , and it is supposed that the Todas may have killed female babies because of food shortage . Rivers , however , can see no evidence for this . I venture to predict that if statistics were available for different tribes the ratios of males and females of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of one sex or the other would not for a large number of tribes show close correlation with the forms of marriage . In primitive tribes most individuals are married . If this is the case and there is a surplus of males or females , other balancing factors must be at work . Among the Navajo , for example , where extreme polygyny is the rule , it is likely that there are more marriageable females than males . But even if the sex ratio is not equal , other factors may even up the marriages . The Navajo themselves suggest that balance is maintained through instability of the marriages . Suppose , for example , there are three men and three women . If one man has three wives , then two must be without wives ; but if one woman leaves her husband after a time , another man gets her for a while . It is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to get data on the length of time each individual lives with his spouses , especially since marriages may be very unstable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the relative number of years the men are sexually active as compared with the women . The women are adolescent , let us say , at fifteen and the menopause occurs at fifty or later where many children are the rule . Thirty-five or forty years of sexual activity among the women compare with fifty among the men , some of whom beget children at sixty-five or over . This is merely a suggestion that in a statistical survey the numbers of individuals sexually active should be compared . It has particular significance in view of the fact that many primitives do not consider it necessary that mates should be nearly of the same age . It is not at all unusual to see a man of seventy-five with a wife of twenty , or a woman of fifty it h a husband of twenty-five . // The evidence is too conflicting to give an absolute reason for the existence of polyandry in one tribe and monogamy in another . As is the case with all social phenomena , it is quite likely that one cause , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be determined , in another ; and that in still another various causes combined to yield the results we find today . Extramarital relations . There is probably no tribe in which formal marriage alone is sexually satisfactory . Perhaps it would be more correct to say that sex is not the most significant fact of marriage . We have previously noted that sex relations in our own society are anything but monogamous even though monogamy is our established form . There is , however , one great difference between our attitude in this matter and that of most primitives . That is , in our society extramarital relations are not sanctioned ; in primitive societies certain such relations not only are sanctioned but may even be obligatory . In this connection primitive conditions are more nearly comparable to conditions in Europe , where prostitution is considered a necessity , rather than to those in America , where it is said not to exist even though it is a thriving business . Even this comparison is remote in its accuracy because primitive sexual relations outside the family after marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious  --  than of a business nature , although actual prostitution is not unknown . We have referred to the form of Toda marriage in which a number of men have a right to a number of women in a marriage bond . The only individuals who may live together in this way must be members of the same moiety . The Todas also sanction intercourse outside the moiety . The system in its entirety is complicated . A man of moiety 1 may get permission to live with a woman of moiety 2 from her husband or husbands . He makes a small payment to the husband , gives a larger gift to the woman 's parents than the husband has given at marriage , and goes through a ceremony similar to the marriage ceremony with her . He may then live with the woman as if she were his wife or visit her at intervals as he desires . The chief difference between this and the regulation marriage is that the man of the moiety not the same as that of the woman can never be the social father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain dairymen , who have particular ceremonial offices in the community , may be the ceremonial lovers of the girls belonging to their own moiety . I know of no case in primitive society // where marriage and sanctioned sexual relations are as complicated as among the Todas.41 There is apparently no conception of sexual immorality , or any attitude of sex jealousy . Among the Eskimo the idea of hospitality as a moral obligation is so highly developed that a man is willing to lend his wife to a lone stranger visiting his village for any length of time . A refusal to do so attaches to him a moral stigma . In connection with a particular ceremony held to drive off evil spirits the same tribe require extramarital relations for a day and a night " The 13a-11a of Northern Rhodesia have the courtesy to lend a wife to a visitor , but consider it an offense if the visitor takes the privilege without an invitation . Sexual license is indulged in at mourning feasts.43 In Australia minutely defined restrictions are placed on formal marriages , but during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions break down  --  men , regardless of their class , totem , or kinship , provided they are not father , brother , or sons of the women , may have access to them . Not only are mating taboos broken on these occasions but other customs also break down . Ordinarily a man must avoid his mother-in-law most carefully , but at such times he may even have intercourse with her should she be assigned to him by the council of old men 44 In fact , ceremonial license commonly exists side by side with formal marriage and may be not only sanctioned but even demanded . The question of sexual relations may not be dismissed with mere marital relationships and ceremonial license between married adults . There are parts of the world where premarital intercourse is not only allowed but expected , it being a part of the cultural fabric . In parts of Melanesia , young people have great freedom in their social activities . The Trobriand Islanders put no curb whatever on young children who imitate their elders in sex matters . In these islands there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approach adolescence spend more and more time in the house delegated to their sex . The boys visit the girls in their clubhouses at night and there is considerable experimentation in lovemaking . Gradually , however , a boy and girl become more pernnlnently attached to each other and there is a period of sexual life 1 in common which leads up to marriage and enables their families ' to make economic preparations for it . During this preliminary perio ( I public display of the relationship of the two individuals is proper ; i it corresponds to the period of engagement . // The Trobriand case is interesting because it marks the direct opposite of our own customs in affairs of love and marriage . As soon as a girl and youth are married the strongest kind of prudery is observed . A man may not touch his wife in public , even if she is ill and needs physical support . No matter how attached to each other they may be , they must never give evidence of tenderness when others are present . They may , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , however remote , is made.4 ' The Trobriand type of trial marriage is not unique . It is found throughout the South Sea area . Among the Bontoc of the Philippines , the custom is pushed so far that a man will not marry a girl until she is pregnant , for he wants proof that she is not sterile . In this tribe , if a girl is deserted by the father of her child , her chances for a good marriage are better than if she had no child.46 Restrictions and preferences . Customs such as those just described are likely to give the impression that the tribes among which they prevail are loose as regards their morals . The fact is that morality ! among them is set in an entirely different direction . There are few , primitive tribes which have no rules regulating the persons who may mate . The most general of these rules applies to incest , which is abhorred . The term " incest " may mean not only the mating of parent with child , or of brother with sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal law forbidden-to marry . Marriage between two members of the same clan is a greater " sin " to the Navajo than sexual immorality is in our society . Such incest has no biological significance . Our large , hybrid population from which to choose mates , our simple social organization based on the most elementary unit , the family , with practical absence of exogamy , incest laws applied only to members of the immediate family , and our theoretic ( if not always practical ) admiration for romantic love , combine to limit restrictions in the choice of a mate . Such restrictions as we have are not inherent in our tribal law , but are rather personal and individual . A number of people still cherish the superstition that cousin marriage is unfortunate , and some in their ignorance create such a suggestive atmosphere as to make it so . It is of course true that marriage between cousins of families affected by heritable diseases increases the chance of offspring developing the same disease . However , the belief that the marriage is bad is not founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not distinguish between weak and // strong family lines . Some states have laws against cousin marriage . A few people still believe that to marry a person of the same name will bring had luck . And we even hear the old saw , " Change the name and not the letter , change for worse and not for better . " But we can not say that any of these superstitions , held only by the more ignorant and unreasonable of our population , has a great influence on our type of marriage . Much less may they be said to be marriage laws , rules , or even customs in the sense in which we find regulations in primitive tribes . No primitive tribes countenance parent-child alliances , and very few sanction sister-brother connections . In a few sanctioned instances of sister-brother marriage they were ( or are ) not the regulation type of marriage for the group , but rather particular sanctions extended to nobles with the underlying idea that no individuals have sufficient prestige to perpetuate the line except the members of the ruling family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hawaii , and for half-brother and half-sister on the Northwest Coast of America , all societies in which hereditary nobility was important . The extension of the incest idea is well illustrated by attitudes toward " cousins . " Parallel cousins are frequently regarded as sisters and brothers and the incest laws apply to them . This may be true whether they belong to the same sib or not . Cross cousins , on the other hand , not only may marry but in many cases should marry . The incest group includes many individuals who are not blood relatives . It may be extended to members of the sib or to individuals belonging to a larger unit including several , even many , sibs . Such a unit may be called a phratry . Indeed , there are tribes which consider marriage within their own tribe " not so good " as marriage outside it . The punishment for incest differs greatly from tribe to tribe . In parts of Australia it is death . Among many peoples it is believed to come through supernatural means . Where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years after will be ascribed to the breaking of the taboo . Bad luck to the society in general may be the result of breaking a taboo . Some tribes merely use ridicule ; some have a form of ostracism . Although there are many marriage restrictions , there are also certain preferences of which cross cousin marriage is perhaps the most common . There are several explanations for the preference . It is a // way of keeping property in a family . In a matrilineal exogamic society , a man 's sister 's son is his legitimate heir . His property may be enjoyed by his own daughter , a blood relative , but not a sib relative , if she marries her cousin ( her father 's sister 's son ) , and at the same time the marriage regulations will be followed . Among the Miwok 47 a man ( 1 ) in former times had marital rights to the daughter ( 4 ) of his wife 's ( 2 ) brother of these rights he had this woman ( 4 ) as one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own mother , were inherited . The man 's son ( 5 ) then inherited from his father his own cross cousin ; that is , his mother 's ( 2 ) brother 's ( 3 ) daughter ( 4 ) . These two examples show clearly how different the origin of a given custom may be in different sociological settings . The cross cousin preference is only one of many specified for socalled " good " marriages . Second cousins are sometimes the first preference . The Navajo consider marriage between grandchildren ( through sons or daughters ) of two blood brothers an excellent match . There are types of prescribed marriage other than those obtaining between blood relatives . One of the greatest favorites is the type called the sororate . By sororate is meant , in polygynous tribes , the marriage of a man to two or more sisters . In monogamous tribes the term signifies that a man takes the sister of the deceased wife as his second wife . Where polygyny is the rule , a common explanation of the sororate is that two sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one man than would two strangers . From our own viewpoint such a result seems unlikely , but from the point of view of the natives , who rarely romanticize marriage , who feel family or sib solidarity as more important than love , and who do not necessarily have the " sole possession " idea of sex , one can well understand that the sororate may be an admirable institution . A Navajo woman may of her own accord suggest that her husband marry her younger sister . If he does , the chances are that all will be happy in the subsequent relationship . In Africa there does not seem to be the same harmony . The Thonga man has a preferential right to his // wife 's younger sister and to the daughters of his wife 's brother , but there is constant jealousy and wrangling among the wives.48 A reason often given by natives for a man marrying his deceased wife 's sister is doubtless a rationalization . They say she will take care of her sister 's children better than a strange woman would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by some woman other than their mother 's sister . Sometimes property laws give a man rights to his sister-in-law . Marriage is almost always accompanied by some business transaction in the form of a gift , payment , or service . If one person is lost or destroyed , another must be supplied by the same social group . The levirate is a custom corresponding to sororate , and means that a man takes over the wife or wives of his deceased brother . He may have the duty of providing for them , or he may have rights to them as a part of his inheritance . The brother or other male members of a deceased husband 's sib had a prerogative to the Navajo widow , and she could not marry another unless they gave her up . She could pay his family and be free to marry a member of another sib . This circumstance leads to the supposition that , if the husband 's sib did not consider the woman herself a form of property , at least her person represented rights and status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of explanations as to singleness of origin ; yet they emphasize the solidarity of the family or sib and the powerlessness of the individual to escape his status . Betrothal , engagement , wedding . The interrelationship between betrothal , engagement , and the time when marriage is considered achieved is so close that often the three periods are not exactly defined . Many tribes have some form of betrothal which is practically as binding as marriage . In parts of Melanesia , where marriage is largely an economic matter , the betrothal is marked by a settlement demanded of the man by the girl 's family . Usually the period of engagement is the time allowed for the families of the contracting parties to accumulate the necessary property . In the Trobriands this period is preceded by a kind of trial marriage . Where the man pays the woman 's family , as among the Pentecost Islanders , his family must contribute a certain amount , and the girl 's family must furnish the feast , a ceremonial matter which frequently demands considerable cooperation and generous contributions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pentecost are so peculiar that one can hardly differentiate betrothal and ma rSOCIAL // riage . What may be called the wedding ceremony is carried out ; the girl goes to live at the home of her husband 's mother ; and if she is very young she does not speak to her husband for some time , even for a number of years . He spends his time at the clubhouse and tries , after the girl is old enough , to tempt her to speak to him . There are no sexual relations until she does so , and there are said to be cases where a woman has died without her husband ever having really lived with her.49 There are a number of methods of obtaining a wife , of which purchase , gift , trade , and service have common elements . When one family presents a gift to another it does not always mean that the person of the betrothed or the bride is considered alienable property , although that idea is possible . The northern Californians , of whom the Yurok are typical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by a man for his wife . It seems as if a girl 's father demanded much , not because he was mercenary but rather to assure the daughter 's position as well as that of her children . A child was legitimate or illegitimate according to the amount paid for his mother . In this case there was no sexual immorality in premarital experiences , but for social and economic reasons a girl was prudent or protected . The fact that a bride of a well-bred , rich Yurok brought with her a large amount of property when she joined her husband shows that , she was not considered " sold " by her father . The sum required of the groom was exact and bargained for ; the wealth brought by the bride was turned over without agreement and was indefinite in amount , but only rarely equivalent to that paid by the groom . The man 's family paid according to tribal law ; the woman 's , according to good taste . It is not at all unusual for the two families concerned with a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make all the demands . I believe this custom to be more directly related in some respects to native attitudes regarding generosity than to those of property and property rights . That the concept of person as property may also enter in is shown by the fact that events subsequent to marriage are of moment as related to payment . The Yurok , for example , consider the bearing of children as a condition of retaining the bride price . If a woman leaves her husband , her family is expected to return the bride price . If , however , the couple have children and the wife allows her husband to keep one of them , only part of the bride price is returned . If two or more children are // given him , the entire payment is canceled . Betrothal of very young children was sometimes agreed upon as a payment of debts if a man was in pressing circumstances . The responsibility of securing a good price for a girl was incumbent upon her brothers in case her father died , and they were entitled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the help of his family , to furnish the entire price demanded for the purchase of his bride , and he may make part of the payment in service . Indeed , there are tribes where nothing but service is expected . The Yukaghir of Siberia serve the father-in-law for the bride , but Jochelson considers such service more as a test of ability than as the equivalent of a bride price . The period of service is indefinite and may be shortened if the man has good qualities or shows that he would not leave the house of his father-in-law , or if the woman becomes pregnant . Such service as is performed takes place before the families have agreed upon the marriage . The approval of both families legalizes the marriage . To all intents and purposes the behavior of the bride and groom differs in only the smallest details during the time of courtship and after marriage . In the case of the Yukaghir the girl 's father seems to demand a guarantee of faith that the son-in-law will stay with him . If he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtship rather than a sanctioned marriage . The young man is subservient to the elder man of his wife 's family at least until a child is born , when he may leave . ' Another method of securing a wife is by means of exchange . A brother and sister of one family may marry a sister and brother of another , thus squaring the indebtedness . In northern California , although the payment by one side of the family canceled that of the other , nevertheless two single payments were made . This example shows how important was the public formality of payment . Even in tribes where it is not considered necessary to go through two transactions , ordinarily some minor formality is observed to show the agreement between the two families , and therefore the legitimacy of the marriage . Examples of payment of a bride price are numerous . Payment of a dowry , if it occurs at all , is exceedingly rare . In most cases gifts are exchanged by the members of the husband 's and wife 's families . These particular ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long period , depending on the customs prevailing in the tribe to which he belongs . If there is infant betroth:il // or marriage his fate may be decided when he is born or even before . The fact of purchase , gift , service , or exchange follows the persons concerned through life , may attach the children to the mother 's or father 's family in case of divorce , and may even determine the fate of an individual in case the mate dies . There are several other ways of getting a spouse , the importance of which was previously much exaggerated . One of those is marriage by capture and the other is elopement . It is questionable whether there are any tribes in which marriage by capture was ever the sole recognized formality , it being found most often side by side with other conventions , among which capture figures less importantly . The same is true of elopement . There are tribes in which elopement is decried and a few in which it is countenanced , even formalized . Among the Kurnai of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry 52 Free choice , is exceedingly rare . Among the Trobriand Islanders , for instance , a girl may choose her husband but he will not be approved by her family unless he is of another totem and of practically equal rank . Romantic love is known in this area , but can not be defined exactly as among ourselves . In former times there was regard for romantic love in Hawaii ; and if all the " ifs " regarding class , rank , etc. , were met , lovers might marry . On the whole , there are three general features which differentiate primitive marriage from our own . ( 1 ) ' The individuals contracting the marriage have comparatively little choice in the matter . ( 2 ) The fact of marriage with its attendant preliminaries and subsequent obligations is a group affair , involving most particularly the families or sibs of the contracting parties . ( 3 ) The religious and particularly the moralistic ideas related to marriage differ so widely from ours as to be practically noncomparable . Marriages , instead of being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the families , of the incumbents and obtain sanction by frank , definite , often public , demonstrations of some economic arrangement . The moralistic phase is attended to before sanctions of any kind are given , which means usually before betrothal . The most widespread conception of " sin " in reference to marriage is that of incest . Whatever may be the definition of the incest group  --  and the definitions are legion  --  marriage within it is " bad , " not because it is an offense against the supernatural punishable in another life , but because it brings harm to the group to which the offenders belong . // A discussion of weddings would lead into descriptions too involved in detail to be taken up here . Suffice it to say that we meet the same amount of variability as to wedding formalities as we move from tribe to tribe that we do in other social phenomena . We find in some cases entire absence of formality . The tribes of California east of the Sierra and those on the Colorado River have none . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage consists in that fact . They are as simply divorced . No economic or religious elements enter into these cases . From this simplest type of marriage there are all gradations up to the elaborate ceremony of the Manus of Melanesia and the wedding potlatch of the Indians of the Northwest Coast . In general , however , the negotiations leading up to marriage , and the fulfillment of the duties and enjoyment of privileges after marriage , function more strongly than anything having to do with the wedding itself . The fact of marriage , either potential or actual , may set in motion a whole series of adjustments , not only between the individuals concerned but also between various members of their families . It may cause an entire change in their behavior . When a Manus girl is engaged , as early as the age of seven or eight , she must begin to hide her face from certain men in the village because of their relationship to her fiance . Even if she herself is not engaged , her sisters or cousins may be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are betrothed . The number of taboo relatives is so great and the requirements of avoidance so exacting that many childish pleasures must gradually be given up . A little girl 's father ceases to take her with him because he does not need to avoid the men she does . The men do not retreat ; if the taboo is to be kept and kept it must be the girl must retire in their presence . Consequently it happens that her activities are much restricted and her pleasures curtailed until at ten or twelve there is little freedom left , and that little ceases absolutely as soon as menstruation begins.53 This description is only one of many which might be given to illustrate the prevalence of " avoidance . " The tribes which have it are numerous , but the forms in which it exists differ greatly from one area to another . One of the most usual forms is that a motherin-law avoids her son-in-law completely . This may mean that a woman may never even see her son-in-law , much less speak to h i m . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail she must t 111 ' 11 // aside and cover her face . One can easily imagine how inconvenient such a custom may become , especially in small communities where the people live close together . There is no better example of the fact that efficiency and convenience are not felt to be important than the cases where matrilocal residence and mother-in-law taboo prevail . The Navajo have both . A man lives with his wife 's people in a house built near that of his mother-in-law . Habits of avoidance are developed by both parties and they are aided by other members of the family . For example , a daughter will tell her husband where her mother is before he attempts to enter her house . So exaggerated is the taboo that a woman may not even attend her daughter 's wedding . Death alone removes it . Among the Apache , neighbors and relatives of the Navajo , the taboo is kept by all the sisters of the mother-in-law as well as by all those called " sister " by her . Consequently , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of polygyny or because his wife or wives have died , there is a large group of women which he will have to avoid . Avoidance is by no means restricted to the mother-in-law relationship . It may be found between father-in-law and son-in-law , as in certain Siberian tribes , and between other relatives by marriage . All individuals addressing others as siblings of the opposite sex may completely avoid one another . This form of the custom is common in Melanesia . Altogether the differences in avoidance are great as to the individuals who observe them as well as in the degree to which avoidance is carried . The Navajo mother-in-law is an example of complete avoidance , as is the Melanesian type in which a brother may never enter the house in which his sister is . Not being allowed to hand an object directly to a person to be avoided is a milder degree of this custom . A sister and brother may eat together , but if the girl wants something near her brother , either she gets it for herself or the brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table near enough for her to reach it . Another mild form is name avoidance , in which case one of the individuals concerned is not allowed to mention the name of the other ; still another is the custom of addressing the avoided person in the third person , as " he " or " she , " instead of as " you . " In many tribes  --  and often they are the same as those which have some type of avoidance there is a custom quite as peculiar // but diametrically opposite . Certain relatives , frequently those of opposite sex , have the privilege of saying anything they wish to each other . Whereas avoidance frequently takes the form that matters pertaining to sex must be particularly avoided , privileged familiarity especially emphasizes the fact that sex may be joked about . A typical example is joking between cross cousins . They may tease each other about shortcomings . The teasing may go to great lengths of criticism or censorship . The joking relatives may make public exhibitions of fondness for each other  --  such exhibitions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke about sex natters . For instance , the thought of marrying into one 's own clan should properly be put out of mind ; nevertheless cousins may accuse each other of doing so , or of having sexual relations with members of their own clan . In its most exaggerated form joking is obscene , not only in our sense , but even in the native sense of the word . The most important rule of the game  --  it may well be called a game  --  is that the persons standing in joking relationship may not become angry no matter what one may say to another . One of my Navajo informants told me he would never get angry if one of his cousins teased him , no matter what he said , but three or four of them could sometimes " tease him down . " The freedom of joking relationship entitles one of those concerned to free use of the other 's property . In parts of Melanesia a man and his mother 's brother observe a joking relationship . The nephew may appropriate any of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even destroy a favorite canoe and his uncle will not object . In an Hawaiian tale a hero begged to be taken on an expedition his ten brothers were undertaking to get rid of him . The brothers all refused him , but when he begged his brother 's son the latter could not refuse , and they had to take him although their undertaking then lost its purpose.a4 The very fact that so many reasonable theories have been propounded to explain the peculiar customs of avoidance and joking is perhaps as good proof as any that neither is subject to a blanket explanation . There is not space here to go into a detailed examination of the theories which have been advanced . We may briefly summarize some of them , however , in order to give some idea . of the theoretical importance of customs such as these . Frazer has assumed that avoidance between members of the opposite sex is due to an extension of the incest group from the small // and purely biological to the larger social ones . He further advances the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of those observed toward members of the opposite sex.55 Freud applies the findings of psychoanalytic methods in a western European culture to primitive tribes and concludes that avoidance is motivated by a desire to prevent incest . The reasoning whereby he evolves his conclusions differs greatly from Frazer 's , which is based on sociological factors entirely ignored by Freud.56 Tylor , in a statistical study , correlates the various sociological phenomena of avoidance , joking relationship , residence and teknonymy ( the custom of naming a parent father or mother of so and so  --  that is , the name of the child ) and argues that each must be explained in terms of the others . That is , customs of this kind certainly have a reciprocal effect on one another . He concludes , on this basis , that avoidance is due to residence ; that in a society where residence is matrilocal one might reasonably expect mother-in-law and son-inlaw avoidance ; and where patrilocal residence is the rule , daughterin-law and father-in-law avoidance . He further argues that individuals marrying into a family and coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arouse suspicion and irritation.57 Tylor 's theory is a part of the theory of " group hostility " which was more specifically developed in another way by Rivers . " In his study of Melanesian society he finds brother-sister avoidance only in those tribes which were influenced by the intrusion of outsiders . He accepts avoidance , therefore , as a means of preventing the sexual laxity which accompanies the advent of new peoples  --  in this particular case , the Polynesians . He suggests that brother avoidance is a survival from a time when brothers had wives in common , the change to a condition when only one brother had rights to a woman giving rise to a restraint now continued as avoidance . Rivers 's explanation of avoidance between relatives-in-law is that it was established to prevent even the semblance of approach between individuals when one was in a disadvantageous position , thus premising an attitude of hostility between two moieties . He realizes that particular details seem to refute rather than support his explanation , but in general subscribes to the theory that " hostility is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives by marriage is a late development based upon the development of individual marriage . " Rivers 's arguments depend upon faith in the survivals of a prehistoric past . // Parsons summarizes the various theories previously propounded and advances one , in my opinion , more humanly probable . She differentiates between hostility and embarrassment and insists that avoidance , at least between relatives-in-law , may be explained by the fact that strangers coming into a family cause a feeling of restraint whether residence is common or not . This reserve may be expressed by requiring the newcomer to observe conditions of respect  --  that is , to recognize the family status . In other words , each individual must be kept in his place . " Lowie assumes that the horror of incest between brothers and sisters is instinctive and that social avoidance is not a biological necessity . He further emphasizes the principle , advanced by Goldenweiser and Rivers for specific areas , that " social and sexual restrictions go hand in hand , " and supplements it with another , " that licensed familiarity generally obtains between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quite rightly finds it necessary to differentiate between parent-in-law avoidance and similar taboos observed by members of the opposite sex of the same generation . To explain the Crow restriction between father-in-law and son-in-law , and between two brothers-in-law , he falls back on Dr. Parsons 's solution of the necessity of preserving status . " No matter what the causes no one cause can be proved for the many types  --  of avoidance , certain it is that at the present time it is a matter of respect . A woman does not demand that her son-in-law observe the taboo because she is hostile to him , but because she wants him to respect her . This is the case in many parts of America and there is reason to believe it to be the case in Melanesia and Africa as well . In my opinion , llr . Parsons 's insistence on preserving status explains more of the manifestations of avoidance than any of the other theories and it might even include the reason for privileged license , for that is recognition of status which allows disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mates does not hold in such cases as that of the Navajo , where it obtains between cross cousins of the same and of opposite sex . Cross cousin marriage is even strongly disapproved and is rarely found in actual practice . The joking relationship is indulged in also by a man and his maternal or paternal uncles and aunts . As regards the cross cousin joking occurring with absence of cross cousin marriage Rivers would undoubtedly have argued that the fact of joking pointed to a survival of cross cousin marriage which was // common in some earlier period of Navajo history . Westermarck pointed out quite reasonably that by the theory of survivals one might prove anything , and that since it is based on speculation it takes unfair advantage of positive evidence . The survival theory , which can as easily assume one form as another , can not be accepted , because cultural elements may be found widely scattered in space with constantly changing interpretations , and even in a given tribe the interpretation of a custom may change through a period of time . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a defense calculated to ward off the influence of foreigners  --  must likewise be repudiated . To begin with , the amount of intermarriage between hostile tribes is so small in comparison with the total number of marriages within a given group as to be negligible . Even if it were a powerful factor in that part of Melanesia discussed by Rivers , it is nevertheless a tiny portion of the world in comparison with the other areas where avoidance is practiced . Of all the theories Freud 's seems to me the weakest , because it shows no comprehension of the hold culture has on individual or group thinking . It assumes that all the world must think as a Viennese thinks . Parsons belongs to that school of anthropologists which contends that the complexity and close interrelation of various social phenomena forbid giving a general cause for each as it is found the world over . Lowie also belongs to this school and emphasizes the fact that each time the custom is found it should be studied with close attention to the entire social setting . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely that in one region a given cause is plausible , and that in another region the cause is entirely different . Divorce . Ideas regarding divorce among primitives are as varied as those regulating marriage . Within a given group , however , there is likely to be a more uniform attitude than among ourselves . In many cases adultery is one of the least important causes for divorce . Where it is considered a cause , it is often tied up with the fact that marriage represents a business transaction . A woman 's person is , in some of these cases , subject to her husband 's control . Violation is the same as theft . Such is the case , for example , in parts of Africa where adultery is considered a crime . It is far more likely , however , to be punished by a fine than by divorce , unless the woman remains with her lover , in which case her family must return the bride price to the husband . Among the Ila more common grounds for divorce , which means // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , laziness , neglect to provide food for the husband , and sterility . " The last is a cause for divorce among the Thonga , as are also incompatibility and witchcraft.62 Barrenness is perhaps the most common ground for divorce . This fact shows how important offspring are for the family as a social and economic unit . It is also a part of the attitude regarding the price paid for a woman at marriage as we have previously seen in the case of the Yurok . There are only two reasons for a Toda to divorce his wife . One is that she is a fool ; the other , that she will not work . Barrenness is no reason , for in case no children are born , a man takes a second wife . When , for either of the reasons given , a man wants a divorce he pays one buffalo to his wife 's people and receives in return any buffalo he may have paid for the bride price.63 In the Southwest of North America , among the Zuni , who are monogamous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . She simply places her husband 's belongings outside the door he lives in her house  --  to indicate that he is persona non grata . The man , who accepts his wife 's decision , goes back to his mother 's house , which is his permanent home . He may also leave on his own initiative . In most cases where property is involved divorce consists in the property being returned . Divorce then , as well as marriage , is a family affair . In Africa it happens frequently that this arrangement is a curb on easy divorce , for often the amount paid for a wife has been used by her family to secure a wife for her brother , or for other purposes . It may consequently be very inconvenient to allow the divorce , and the members of the family try to tide over the differences between the spouses by arbitration . Kinship terms . In many primitive societies the personal name is not used as a term of designation . Often it has religious significance . The Eskimo believe that a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sickly its name may be changed to one which will make it stronger The Navajo use the name as a charm to drive off evil , for they believe it has strong magic power which will help its owner out of difficulties . Consequently it should not be used except in emergencies , for its power may wear out.65 Among the Ila in Africa the birthname of any person may be used only by his closest relatives  - -  that is , by parents and siblings  --  because , since a person is thought // to be the reincarnation of an ancestor , the name is sacred and is to be treated with the greatest respect ; that means it should be avoided . " On the Northwest Coast of America names are property , in the sense that they may be applied only to those who are entitled to them through inheritance , marriage , gift , or war . The function of the name is so varied in different tribes that the ethnologist tries to learn what it is before asking , " What is your name ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may even be considered a grave insult . Usually there are complicated rules of etiquette on the use of the name , based on prevailing beliefs and , in addition , on the relationship between individuals bearing the name and those using it . If there is an avoidance relationship it is likely to affect the use of the name . A common way of getting around such difficulties is to avoid the " real " name  --  that is , the one bestowed ceremonially or for reasons of belief and to use instead nicknames which may have reference to an occasion , a locality , a personal idiosyncrasy , or a form of behavior . More commonly kinship terms are used , not only for members of the family , but even for strangers . Almost every tribe has a title of respect for old persons which may be the same as the kin term for " grandmother " or " grandfather . " Since the organization so often differs greatly from ours , it is reasonable to expect that the kinship systems will also differ greatly . Differences depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining to some extent and limiting the terms . Besides this , social requirements may change the origins meaning of a kin term so as to make it vary greatly among the different tribes using it . Widely separated tribes having closely related languages may have the same kin terms with different meanings ; neighboring tribes speaking languages entirely unrelated may use certain kin terms in common . Sometimes a word is borrowed , together with the meaning ; and again the word may be taken over in an entirely different context . Furthermore , the interpretation of the word may be borrowed without the word itself . " The most essential features of language are classification and generalization . When I say " flower " I do not think of all the characteristics of a flower , but I may mean columbine , wild geranium , house lily , or orchid , none of which have the same description . In the same way I may say " uncle " or " cousin " and the listener will understand well enough what I mean , but he will not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's , nor will he know
