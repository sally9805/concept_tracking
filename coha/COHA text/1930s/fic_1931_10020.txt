v l A rite 711E Festival Benvenuto resumed his work withrenewed enthusiasm . The music had for the time calmed the resentment he felt toward the Bishop . What a wise friend Cian was ! As he said , the silver vase was but a stepping stone to greater achievements . The Pope had promised him commissions . Now he could snap his fingers at t he vituperative messages of Salamanca . The vase would he his passport to higher and more agreeable associations , but as such it must represent the artist at his best . Benvenuto applied himself so diligently that the tiny Pagolinofelt he had in some way incurred the displeasure of his master . The notes of the flute no longer echoed through the shop . No more did the master joke with him , or sometimes seize him in his arms . Pagolino came to hate the vase as he had hated Cesena , when the Pope 's musician interrupted them that first time his master played alone for him . Benvenuto sometimes turned to other work to relieve the strain upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , as relaxation , the artist made some drawings for other vases , much smaller than Salamanca 's , in which he amused himself by indulging his capricious fancy to the full . Then he returned to his bench , leaving the drawings , by chance , where they could be seen by passers-by . These designs caught the eye of the famous surgeon , Giacopo da Carpi , as he paused in front of Santi 's shop . Attracted by them , he entered and asked permission to make a closer examination . Although the surgeon had not been long in Rome , Benvenuto recognizedhim , and , knowing of his reputation as a connoisseur , was pleased by the interest he expressed. 40THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 41 " What will you charge to fashion for me one or two of these graceful vases in silver ? " Da Carpi inquired . Benvenuto remembered the stories he had heard of the exorbitant fees the surgeon charged his wealthy patients for working what seemed miracles by means of certain fumigationsuntil then unknown in Rome . The artist glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messer da Carpi , finished in silver after any one of those designs , will cost you fifty golden crowns . " The surgeon looked at him in surprise . " You must be well aware that fifty crowns is far in excess of what pieces such as these bring in the goldsmiths ' trade . " " Quite true , " Benvenuto answered calmly . " The price you charge for the exercise of your skill is far in excess of what such service ordinarily brings . Why do people pay it ? " The surgeon was amused by the boy 's question . " Because I can give them of my skill and knowledge beyond others . " " That is the answer I would make to your question of the price I fixed . " " Do people recognize you , then , as the greatest goldsmith in the world ? " " I recognize it , " Benvenuto answered frankly . " That is of the main importance . " " Then let me be among the first to join you in that recognition , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these vases in silver , and I will pay your price . This is but proper as between two great masters ! " " I must keep you waiting until I have completed this large piece for the Bishop of Salamanca , " the artist explained . Then he added with a smile , " Messer da Carpi , if you would treat Salamanca with one of your fumigations , it might perhaps relieve me of a distasteful patron and enable me to give precedence to your commission . " 42 DAGGER AND JEWELSDa Carpi advanced to Benvenuto 's bench and examined the vase with great care . " You almost tempt me , " he replied , filled with admiration for the lovely masks and the grace of the delicate engraving . " If I were assured that by doing what you ask I could myself gain possession of this marvelous piece , I might prescribe for him that which would reduce his prodigious bulk to bones ! " Ten days later Benvenuto surprised Pagolino by shouting to him , " Bambino , bring me the pipe ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized the flute and waved it excitedly about his head . " The vase is finished , Pagolino ! Tell me , did your eyes ever rest on anything so beautiful ! " " I think the notes you draw from that pipe , master , are far more beautiful than what you fashion in silver . " " You could not understand , bambino , " Benvenuto answeredwithout taking his eyes from the finished creation . " How could a child like you comprehend a message from God expressed through the tips of my fingers ? But it is finished , and we will play a monet of thanksgiving , in which I shall improvise a note of triumph . " The unexpected sound of revelry brought Lucagnolo into that part of Santi 's shop that had been set aside for Benvenuto 's use . " Have you suddenly gone mad ? " he demanded . " Mad with joy , " Benvenuto answered . " Look at it , Lucagnolo ! It is finished ! Did you ever imagine a vase so beautiful as that ? " The elder goldsmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display his superior knowledge , but as he studied each detail his enthusiasm almost equalled Benvenuto 's . Impulsively he kissed him on each cheek . " I am proud to have such a piece as that fashioned in Santi 's shop , " he exclaimed . " We must show it throughout the trade , for never has such skill been seen in the Goldsmiths ' Guild . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 43Benvenuto beamed at this unstinted praise . " You called me a boaster , Lucagnolo . You said I was a pouter pigeon . Have I not answered you in that vase ? " " You gave your answer when you defeated me with MadonnaPorzia 's jewel , Benvenuto . Gian was the first to recognizeyour genius , when he entreated me to let you fashion this piece . Now we must take it to Raffaello del Moro . He is dean of the goldsmiths in the Banchi , and will give it recognition . " " All is in your hands , Lucagnolo . The vase has brought me nothing but annoyance in the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it now as you will . " Raffaello del Moro ranked high in the Goldsmiths ' Guild of Rome . When precious stones were to be considered , no other jeweler equalled his knowledge or his skill in setting . Benvenuto knew him slightly , but until now had been a stranger to his shop . Lucagnolo was still excited as the two walked briskly along . " Raffaello is not only a great goldsmith but a great scholar , Benvenuto , " he remarked . " He is rich , but he considers his daughter , the lovely Lucilla , the rarest gem in his collection . He has brought her up in ways of modesty , and has taught her much of his own learning . " Benvenuto was all attention . Was there a beautiful girl in the vicinity of the Banchi whom he had not met ? " Where does Raffaello keep this precious jewel ? " he inquired . " Aha , lad ! this is a petticoat of a different pattern , " Lucagnolocautioned him . " I have yet to meet the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her , " the boy declared confidently . " Then be prepared to have your record broken , " his companioninsisted firmly . " Lucilla 's virtue is as unusual as her beauty . Del Moro has taught her to read rather than to sew ; to write poetry and to play the lute rather than to gad about. 44 DAGGER AND JEWELSNow he reaps his reward , for she prefers her father 's comradeshipbeyond that of any of the young blades .  --  Here we are . Now watch Raffaello 's face when he sees this masterpiece ! " The old man was seated in his shop , carefully examining a diamond which he turned in the light to gain the brilliant flashes from its facets . " Come in , " he called to the new arrivals . " You are just in time to see this stone I have tinted for the Pope . What do you think of the experiment ? " Lucagnolo took the jewel in his hand and examined it critically . " You have surely added to the beauty Nature gave it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is my young assistant in Santi 's shop , who calls himself Benvenuto Cellini . Perhaps you have already heard of him . " " Of course I have , " Raffaello acknowledged , smiling as he held out his hand . " Who has not heard of Benvenuto Cellini ! I hear also that he has become even my rival through his masterly resetting of Madonna Porzia 's lily . " " We are here to show you another example of his work , " Lucagnolo announced . " The lily was all right in its way , but this is something I can better understand . " He unwrapped the vase and placed it on the bench . " Tell me , do I make an over-estimate when I say that I consider this the finest work I have yet seen done in Rome ? " Raffaello sobered in the face of Lucagnolo 's claim . He rose from his chair and regarded the piece from every side . " I doubted your assertion , Lucagnolo , " he said at length , " but the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , With your permission , I will call my daughter . She is an equal judge with me , and her love of beauty is no less . " A moment later Lucilla entered the room , and Benvenuto gratified his curiosity as aroused by Lucagnolo 's comments . She was more lovely even than he had expected , but it was THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 45the fearless intelligence that shone in her expressive brown eyes , lighting her whole face , which most affected him . Here was a girl such as he had never imagined , who approached them in response to the summons with a poise he had not associated with women . " You called me , my father ? " she asked in a low , musical voice . " Yes , Lucilla , Lucagnolo has brought me something which in its beauty is beyond common , and I wish you to see it . This young man , Benvenuto Cellini , who fashioned it , has proved himself one of our best goldsmiths . You should becomefamiliar with his Art . " As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Messer Raffaello , you surely had Galatea in your heart when you created Lucilla ! " A becoming flush came into the girl 's face as she heard the ingenuous compliment . Del Moro smiled . " We are here to admire your work , my friend , rather than mine . " The boy seemed not to hear Raffaello 's words , so intent was he in watching Lucilla as she turned to examine the vase . She wore a gown of rich , blue brocade , which set off to perfectionher graceful figure . Benvenuto missed no one of the details from the poise of her lovely head to the superb line of her throat of tinted ivory , which rose from the lace that failed to conceal the delicate beauty of her shoulder . The waves of her soft brown hair were confined in braids , in which were intertwined blue ribbons and a string of Raffaello'spearls . It seemed incredible that any woman could appear so utterly unconscious of her beauty , as she examined the vase with an interest as critical and professional as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so frank an expression of admiration , he experienced the novel sensation of embarrassment . " This work shows a master 's skill , " she said quietly . " I do46 DAGGER AND JEWELSnot remember to have seen its equal . Perhaps some other time Benvenuto will bring us additional examples of his genius . " As Raffaello engaged Lucagnolo in conversation , the young artist recovered his composure , and approached nearer to where Lucilla was standing . " May I do that ? " he asked eagerly . " I have many others which in their way are no less beautiful than the vase . I should like to show them to you . " She smiled aggravatingly at him from beneath her halfclosedlids . " My father will be happy to see them whenever you come . " " And you ? " he insisted . " Will you  --  " She laughed lightly . " My father shares everything with me , " she answered . " What of this Benvenuto Cellini ? " Raffaello was asking Lucagnolo . " I recognize that look he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself was not indifferent to his open admiration . " Lucagnolo chuckled as he realized the purpose behind the question . " You might do worse than have him for your sonin-law , " he answered . " Benvenuto perhaps has his eye always open for a pretty face and figure , but what young man has not ? The youth has genius , Raffaello , and would be a credit to your house , but there is little sentiment in his make-up . He even boasts that he will never serve woman  --  that he will make woman serve him . " " I think I made that boast myself when I was young , " Del Moro remarked genially . " Lucilla has a suitor named Pompeo whom I do not approve , and competition might assist my cause . " " If you mean Pompeo , the Pope 's goldsmith , I share your ill opinion . He is a slippery devil . " " But quite the gallant with the ladies , " Raffaello added . " You say that you are on your way to Salamanca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with me that we may become acquainted ? " " An excellent suggestion , Raffaello  --  particularly as the Bishop does not like him , and I can undoubtedly get the piece appraised at higher value . " Benvenuto was willing enough to accept Lucagnolo 's suggestion . His curiosity had changed to interest , and he was eager to learn more of this fascinating personality which met him so fearlessly and yet made him feel the presence of an impenetrable protecting barrier . " You are right , Lucagnolo , " he admitted magnanimously . " You will know how to handle Salamanca better than I. " Raffaello 's house , on the via de ' Banchi , was of massive stone , broken only by small windows guarded by iron bars , and surmounted by a tiled-roofed terrace . A great wooden door , with scrolled hinges that threw out their tentacles like an octopus , admitted to the shop on the ground floor , and this in turn opened upon a small court , where , well placed on the plot of grass , stood marble statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . An old mimosa tree had partially worked its way into the wall surrounding the court , threatening to disturb the grizzly stones , and the odor of the fragrant yellow blossoms filled the house . At the opposite end of the shop a smaller door opened into an ante-chamber , from which ran a stone staircase to the floor above . Here Benvenuto found himself admitted to a livingroomwhich seemed a veritable part of his new friends , so clearly did it reveal their personalities . The furnishings were of the early Renaissance . The great table and the bookcases were of dull oak , delicately carved , and the chairs were upholstered in rose-colored velvet . On a leggio , in a corner by the bookcase , rested a rare , illuminated copy of Saint Augustine'sDe Civitate Dei . On the shelves were other examples48 DAGGER AND JEWELSof the scribes ' work , and volumes printed by the new mechanicalart in the shops of Cennini of Florence , of Ulrich Hahn of Rome , and even of the great master Aldus Manutius of Venice . In another corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bronze tripod-lamp rested on the table , and on top of the bookcases were pottery vessels , in which brilliant-colored flowers from Lucilla 's garden relieved the somber tone of the room . As they entered , Raffaello picked up a printed copy of Virgil from the table . " You have been reading this , my Lucilla ? " he asked glancing at the title . As she nodded , he passed the book to Benvenuto . " This is an example of a great man 's contribution to the world , " he said . " We goldsmiths work in metal and in precious gems . So did Aldus , but the metal he used was to make his types , and the gems for which he fashioned the settings were the jewels of thought . When I first learned of the invention of the art of printing I feared that the glory of the Book was ended ; but , instead of that , these mechanically produced volumes place these gems of thought within the reach of thousands who otherwise could never revel in their beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But this is printed in the Latin tongue , " he exclaimed to Lucilla . " I thought only men read Latin . " " My father has made both Latin and Greek the same to me as my own beloved Italian , " the girl replied . " By his wisdom he has unlocked treasure houses that would otherwise have remained closed . " The atmosphere in which he found himself deeply impressedthe youth . In the Villa Chigi he had found greater magnificence , in the apartments of Salamanca and the Pope he was familiar with greater ostentation ; but here the beauty of each separate piece seemed a part of the life going onTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 49about it . He was loath to leave the room when Lucilla suggestedthat , in the failing light , the loggia , with its vista of the Campagna , would be more agreeable . Here the evening meal was served , after which the three remained long into the soft , Spring evening , discussing people and affairs . Benvenuto was amazed to find the girl so well informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he came to understand what Lucagnolo had told him . As the twilight deepened into darkness , Lucilla brought out her lute , and played so sweetly that the notes ran in his head long after he returned to his lodgings near the Angelo della Campanella , farther along the Banchi . Chapter VII S ALAMANCA had not recovered from his displeasure over the long delay in completing his commission , yet , in spite of his efforts to conceal his admiration for the vase , Lucagnolo knew well that the finished piece surpassed the Bishop 's highest expectations . The goldsmith had foreseen discussion over the valuation , but to his surprise Salamanca offered no objections . " I accept the price you place upon this piece , " he said . Then , as Lucagnolo took his leave , well satisfied with the results of his embassy , the Bishop added , " The price after all is not important , for I swear before God that I will take as long a time in paying this Cellini for the vase as he has lagged in the making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shop , aghast at the complication in which his good-natured friendliness now involved him . Nor was he relieved to have Benvenuto arrive at his bench earlier than usual the following morning . By degrees Lucagnolo made his unwelcome report , and the torrent of abuse the disappointed youth poured upon the head of the offending Bishop did not surprise him . " You could not have helped it , Lucagnolo , " Benvenuto admitted . " Had I delivered the vase myself , the only difference would have been that I should have fetched it back with me when Salamanca refused payment . But you shall see . My God , who has always protected me from the snares of my enemies , will not desert me now . I do n't quite see how He can accomplish it this time , but we will wait . " Benvenuto worked off his passion by applying himself to the two small vases Da Carpi had commissioned , and within a fortnight they were finished . On his way to deliver them , he50THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 51stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his praise . Nor was his approval less than Lucilla 's . She was indignant at Salamanca 's shabby trick , and her brown eyes snapped in a way that seemed to Benvenuto most becoming . The surgeon received the vases with unrestrained delight . " You have indeed given me something other goldsmiths could not give , " he said , " which warrants the excessive price you charge . " In the meantime Salamanca was gaining much satisfaction from the possession of his vase . It was admired by his courtiers , and he even boasted of it to the Pope . Soon after its delivery , the Bishop received a delegation of Spanish grandees at his palace , and made a point of showing them his new treasure . While it was being examined Salamanca was called from the room , and he left the vase in the hands of his guests . One of the ingenious devices Benvenuto had added , beyond the beauty of the ornaments , was a handle made with such delicate mechanism that , when a spring was touched , it lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to another , a Spanish gentleman , playing with the handle as if it were a toy , broke the spring . Deeply mortified , and fearing the displeasureof the Bishop , the grandee summoned the majordomo who had charge of Salamanca 's plate and explained the accident . " Take this vase quickly to the artist who made it , " he urged . " Pay him his own price to mend it , and get it back before your master discovers its absence . " The majordomo , impressed by the bag of gold the grandee pressed into his hand , ran all the way to Santi 's shop . Handing the vase to Benvenuto , he ordered him peremptorily to make the necessary repairs . " Oh , God , " the youth cried excitedly when he found the piece again in his possession , " I knew that Thou wouldst find a way ! " The majordomo , unaware of what lay behind these words , departed , saying that he would52 DAGGER AND JEWELSreturn in a few hours to receive it back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , " come and see what I have here ! " " The Bishop 's vase ! " Lucagnolo exclaimed . " Did I not say that my God would protect me ? He has addled the wits of some member of the Bishop 's suite to make him return the vase to me for repairs ! Now let Salamanca get it again without payment if he can ! " Long before the appointed time , the broken spring was fixed , and Benvenuto awaited the majordomo 's return . When the surly messenger found the artist joking with Lucagnolo instead of working on the piece , he exclaimed brusquely , " Give me the vase . I have no time to waste . " " I have no intention of giving you the vase , " Benvenuto announced calmly . The majordomo drew his sword . " Then I shall take it . I have my orders from Monsignor " ; but when he saw the dagger which promptly appeared in Benvenuto 's hand , and noted the expression on the artist 's face , his attitude became less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained in milder tones . " I must take that vase back at once , for Monsignor has promised to show it to the Pope , and his Holiness is expected . " The adventure was progressing better even than Benvenuto could have hoped ! Then Salamanca thought highly enough of the piece to mention it to Clement ! " What an affair ! " he laughed , turning to Lucagnolo . " His Holiness is invited to inspectmy vase . His Holiness accepts . His Holiness arrives at Salamanca 's , and there is no vase to show ! Oh , Lucagnolo , you should have a God like mine ! Has he not arranged things prettily ? " Seeing that he was being chaffed , the majordomo demanded , " Will you give me that vase , or shall I tell Monsignor of yourTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 53insolence , and return with Spaniards enough to cut you into pieces ? " " How many Spaniards do you figure would be a match for one Italian goldsmith ? " Benvenuto inquired derisively . Then his face darkened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to mention that I demand the money for my work before I will permit it again to leave this shop . " By the time the majordomo returned to the Palace , Salamancahad learned of the accident . His fury was unleashed first against the grandee who had innocently tried to make amends for his carelessness , then against the majordomo for not having taken possession of the piece by force , and finally against the artist himself for daring to place himself in opposition to a Bishop . During the tirade , Gian Francesco entered the apartment , and , realizing the difficulty into which Benvenutohad forced himself , asked to be made the intermediary . " Go to that Cellini , " the Bishop bade him savagely , " and tell him that if he does not bring me the vase at once , the largest piece left of his body shall be his ear ! " Gian hastened to the shop , and knocked on the door . " Who 's there ? " Benvenuto shouted at him in a belligerent voice he scarcely recognized . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was instantly opened . The visitor found the place barricaded like an arsenal . Benvenuto stood clad in coat of mail , with a long poniard in his hand . " Come in , Gian , " he cried joyfully . " You are just in time to see the fun . I have recovered my vase from Salamanca . " " I know , " Gian interrupted . " I have come from him to get it back . " " Oh , Gian ! " Benvenuto exclaimed disgustedly . " With all those people in his suite , why should you be the one he sent ? As you see , I am set for a sweet fight , and now you spoil it54 DAGGER AND JEWELSall ! It is not friendly , Gian .  --  But not even you can get that vase ! " " The Bishop sent me as his emissary , but I really come as your friend , " Gian said quietly . " This is folly , Nutino . If you persist , you will undo all I have done for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gian ; but Salamanca shall not again humiliate me by recovering his vase without payment . It would give him too much satis-faction . " " You shall be paid  --  that I guarantee , " Gian promised ; " but there is far more at stake than money or wounded pride . The Pope is expected at Salamanca 's at any moment . I want his Holiness to see that vase . Now do you understand ? " Benvenuto 's opposition weakened , but the rebellious spirit died hard . " You are a wise counselor , Gian , and a true friend . I will take the piece with you to Salamanca . " Then he sighed . " What a pity ! It would have been such a sweet fight ! " " Now your sanity has returned , " Gian answered , relieved . " Take off that coat of mail , and let us be off . We must return before the Pope arrives . " " Knowing the temper of the Bishop , " Benvenuto replied suggestively , " I think I will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra shirt . My God has been very good to me , Gian , but He would never forgive me if I failed to remain on my guard . " As the two friends entered the Bishop 's palace , Gian carried the vase . They found all the household drawn up in formal array , and , as they walked between the two rows , Benvenuto burst into laughter . Gian looked at him in surprise . " This is like passing through the Zodiac , " the youth exclaimed . " See ! That old boy has the face of a lion , and the fellow next to him looks like a scorpion . And old fuddy-duddy in front of us has the visage of a crab ! " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 55 " Save your humor until we reach the Bishop , " Gian cautioned . " You will need it then . " Scarcely were they in Salamanca 's presence than they were greeted by an angry torrent of words . Influenced by Gian 's presence , Benvenuto made no reply , but stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bishop 's invectivespent itself , and he subsided from sheer lack of breath . he issued an order to one of his attendants , and paper was placed before Benvenuto . " There , " Salamanca commanded . " Write out that you are amply satisfied , and paid in full . " Benvenuto now spoke for the first time . " I will sign a receipt , Monsignor , after I have been paid , but not before . " Again the Bishop 's tun-shaped body shook from anger . Threats alternated with vituperation , but the artist did not yield . Convinced at last of Benvenuto 's stubbornness , Salamancawith ill grace commanded that the money be paid . " Now , " he cried fiercely , " sign that receipt and be gone ! " Before this abrupt dismissal could be accomplished , the loud voice of the majordomo announced , " His Holiness , the Pope , " and all fell upon their knees . As Clement , accompanied by Cardinal Innocenzo Cibo , entered the room , he glanced curiouslyaround . " Rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salamanca , " There seems to be some disturbance here . " " Nothing of importance , most holy Father , " the Bishop replied , somewhat out of breath from his argument with Cellini . " This insolent goldsmith here has required disciplining . " " Insolent ? " Clement turned to Benvenuto , and extended his hand that the artist might kiss his ring . " Have you been doing work for the Bishop ? Why have you been insolent ? " " I made for him a silver vase , your Holiness , and he refused to pay me for it . My insolence lies in my demand for pay-ment. " 56 DAGGER AND JEWELSClement smiled grimly , and turned to Cibo . " This is our soprano , is it not ? " " The same , " Cibo replied . " Is this the goldsmith who fashioned the silver vase of which you boasted ? " the Pope asked Salamanca . " It is , your Holiness . " " You failed to mention who the artist was , Salamanca . I wonder why . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an examination of the piece . At length he turned again to the Bishop . " You have reason to be proud of the possession of an ornament like this , and Benvenuto has equal cause for satisfaction . Let me see , " he added , turning to the youth , " did I not promise you a commission ? " " You did , your Holiness . Not hearing further from you , I could but suppose that you spoke in jest . " " The Pope never jests , " Clement replied . " That man is safest who crosses himself and jests at no one . The fault is yours , Cibo , " he said to his companion . " Ccsena told us that Benvenuto worked miraculously well in the goldsmith 's trade . He has proved himself worthy of that praise . I remember now that I asked you to remind me . You have been remiss , for we are this young man 's friend , and we think highly of him and of his genius . " Salamanca was chagrined at the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seeing that the artist held the favor of the Pope , the Bishop smiled genially . " I , too , think well of this young man 's genius , " he said , " and have in mind to entrust to him still more importantcommissions . " " I will gladly accept them , Monsignor , " Benvenuto replied , bowing low , " provided I am paid for them in advance . " The Pope laughed heartily , while the blood surged in SalaTHEGORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 57manta 's purple face . " Let us talk of other things , " Clement remarked . " I observe that the Bishop is quite close to apoplexy .  --  Benvenuto , yesterday the surgeon , Giacopo da Carpi , showed me two wonderful antique vases . I tried to buy them from him , but he refused , explaining that he had received them from a great lord in Rome in gratitude for a miraculous cure . You should see them , Benvenuto . They would be an inspiration . " " I have already seen them , your Holiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trick the surgeon had played upon him . Seeing a look of surprise in Clement 's face he added , " Naturally I have seen them , for I myself made them for Messer da Carpi . " " What do you mean ? " the Pope demanded . " They were antiques . " " Messer da Carpi must have treated them with his own fumigations , " Benvenuto answered , laughing , " to make them old before their time . Is not one a small , silver drinking-vessel , and the other of similar nature , but with the white lilies of Florence worked into the masks ? " " You have described them perfectly , " the Pope declared , amazed ; " yet Da Carpi claimed them to be antiques ! Your patrons have a way of denying your work , Benvenuto , " he added , looking significantly at Salamanca . " Is that not the usual reward of genius ? " he asked . " It shall no longer be your reward , " Clement declared with feeling . " You shall use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our cousin Leo employed Raphael and Michelangelo .  --  Cibo , see to it that Benvenuto is given important commissionsat once . If he can fashion such a vase for a Bishop , he should design one twice as large for a Pope . " " Not twice as large , your Holiness , " Benvenuto suggested , " but I promise you it shall be twice as beautiful . " " Cibo , we must return , " Clement announced . As Sala-58 DAGGER AND JEWELSmanca kissed his ring , the Pope remarked in great good humor , " If Benvenuto has time to execute some small things for you between our own commissions , he may do so . Provided , of course , " he added slyly , " that you pay for them in advance . " When they were alone , Clement confided with satisfaction to Cibo , " I am indebted to our young soprano , Innocenzo , for the first real victory I have achieved over our cousin Charles . See to it that he has his place at Court . " Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked for some distance in silence . The young artist was sobered by the dramatic turn his affairs had taken , and his friend had not yet recovered from his amazement . " Did I conduct myself as you would have had me ? " Benvenuto inquired at length . His companion laughed . " Had you told me beforehand what your words would be , I should have expected you at this moment to be on your way to the Castle of Sant ' Angelo . " " Why , Gian , " Benvenuto protested , " I but stood my ground . " " Not even the Pope would have dared defy Salamanca as you did . " " But his Holiness took my part . He even seemed pleased by what I said . " Gian laughed again . " He was pleased . You gave him the chance he has long awaited to score on Salamanca . But if the Bishop escapes the apoplexy that threatened him , he will not soon forget you ! You are introducing a new diplomacy at Court , Nutino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are making sport of me , " Benvenuto said reproachfully . " I could never become a diplomat like you , Gian . When a man wrongs me , I resent it , whatever his position . It would be cowardly to accept an insult from a strong man and then force a weakling to pay the penalty . Whatever the results , I must follow the dictates of my conscience . " " After what has happened , who am I to counsel otherwise ? " Gian answered frankly . " You entered Salamanca 's palace a discredited goldsmith ; you leave it an envied man , 596o DAGGER AND JEWELSwearing the halo of the Pope 's approval . Yet , if I might still venture a word of counsel , let me warn you to be even more than ever on your guard . The Pope 's favor engenders jealousies , and Salamanca will not discourage them .

" Gian cried , much impressed , as the two separated . " I only wish I knew my God as well as you know yours ! " Benvenuto continued on to Del Moro 's shop . By the time he arrived , Gian 's warnings were forgotten , and he burst in upon Raffaello with boyish anticipation of the sensation his story would produce . " Where is Lucilla ? " he demanded , scarcely giving the old man time to recover from his impulsive embrace . " I bring great news ! I have forced old Salamanca to pay me for my vase , and the Pope has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon Da Carpi tried to palm off as antiques those two silver pieces I made for him , and  --  " " Peace ! " Raffaello laughed . " One bit at a time ! I will call Lucilla . " The girl had overheard Benvenuto 's words , and entered from the garden , her face lighted with anticipation . " What do you say , Benvenuto ? Salamanca has really paid ? " " Through the nose , Lucilla ! " Then he related the events as they had happened , beginning with the unexpected return of the vase for repairs . During theTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 6irecital , the two auditors glanced at each other aghast as Benvenutorepeated his audacious words , and described his fearlessattitude ; but when he repeated Clement 's parting remark to the Bishop the girl burst into a peal of laughter , in which her father joined with more restraint . " I do not wonder that Salamanca was near to apoplexy , " Lucilla declared . " What an encounter ! And His Holiness seemed not to resent the words you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under his tongue . Gian says the Pope himself would not have dared to force the Bishop as I did . Why should he not ? " Raffaello recognized that Benvenuto was sublimely unconsciousof the enormity of his actions , but fully realized the delightClement must have taken in the humiliation of his unpopularbut powerful Bishop . The old man had come to know the youth in his changing moods , and while he was frightened , as was Lucilla , by what might have happened , he dared not quench the fire that had carried Benvenuto safely through this dangerous adventure . " His Holiness has already angered the Emperor by the favor he has shown to France , " Raffaello explained quietly , " and Charles is awaiting an excuse , which Salamanca will supply , to bring down his heavy hand on Clement . You were playing with edged tools , my son , but you handled them with surprising skill . Your place at Court is now assured . " " I could do no less , whatever the results , " Benvenuto answeredcomplacently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gone ? " Lucilla asked . " Frightened ? " There was real surprise in Benvenuto 's ques-t ion . " Fear is an emotion I have yet to feel . It was the Bishop who was frightened lest he lose the vase .  --  Who taught you to place that crimson rose in your hair , Lucilla ? That spot of62 DAGGER AND JEWELScolor , against those beautiful dark strands , tempts me to becomea painter . " Before the girl could reply beyond the echo of the rose which appeared in her cheeks , Raffaello spoke . This impulsive boy appealed to him more and more , and might serve his purpose well against Pompeo . Since their first meeting , the old man had studied him carefully . He deprecated the fiery temper , which had already involved the youth in serious affairs , but recognized it as part of a striking personality . The tall body was lithe but powerful , which explained his courage ; the high forehead indicated his imaginative mind , which expresseditself through the long , supple fingers of his nervous hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penetrating ; the recurring smile was good-humored , even though at times satirical . His quick , expressive gestures made Raffaello understand how instinctively physical reaction would follow a real or fancied injury , but the ingenuous frankness persuadedthe old man that the youth 's reported outbursts were the result of impulse rather than of malice . " Benvenuto , " Raffaello said quietly , " you must now have larger quarters for your work . Why not bring your goldsmith 's tools to this shop , where I can give you better accommodation than you have at Santi 's place ? " Lucilla 's face lighted at her father 's suggestion . " Why not ? " she added her entreaty . " Then I could watch you while you fashion your masterpiece for his Holiness . " Benvenuto looked from one to the other . " That is a kindly suggestion , Messer Raffaello , " he said , pleased by the approval the invitation indicated . " Both Madonna Porzia and Gian Francesco have urged upon me that I change my quarters , but I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty welcome , " the old man confirmed . " Let us consider it as settled . I will see that Lucilla does not interruptTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 63your work , as she suggests , " he added , smiling at the young people indulgently . " But she may do that , " Benvenuto insisted quickly . " She may perhaps prove even an inspiration , if she will always wear a rose in her hair . " Lucagnolo was genuinely grieved to lose his contentious associate from the shop . " You tossed my ideals of Art in the air , " he chided him . " Now you leave me alone to put them on their feet after they land . " " Do n't let them land ! " Benvenuto urged him . " Keep the best always floating just beyond your reach , and strive for it . " A few days later Cellini found himself installed in more commodious quarters in Raffaello del Moro 's shop . His exploit with Salamanca had become town talk , and the Pope 's reparteewas repeated at every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed with commissions . He executed new orders from Madonna Porzia Chigi . Others came from their Worships Cornaro and Salviati , from Niccolo Ridolfi , Bishop of Florence ; and for Gabriello Ceserino , Gonfaloniereof Rome , he fashioned a Leda with her Swan that attracted much attention . Benvenuto was gratified by this approval of his work , yet the artist in him insisted that he increase his skill and still further enlarge his knowledge . He learned the art of chiseling medals from Carodosso , of making seals from Lautizio , of enameling from studying the work of Amerigo . One evening , when the young artist remained longer than was usual at his bench , Raffaello complimented him upon his industry , and the success in his new ventures . Benvenuto tried to receive this commendation with becoming modesty . " I look upon this extra labor as recreation , " he demurred . " This comes , I think , from a special gift which the God of Nature bestowed upon me  --  a temperament so happy and so well-balanced64 DAGGER AND JEWELSthat I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raffaello saw a shadow pass over Lucilla 's face . After Benvenutoleft them , she asked quietly , " Why is Nutino forever praising himself ? His work is so exquisite that its delicate beauty seems marred when he calls attention to it ! " " Self-esteem , my daughter , is an essential ingredient of genius . All artists are the same . You would not suggest that Pompeo was lacking in self-assurance . " The girl flushed . " I am not making comparisons , my father . There is no doubt that Pompeo appreciates his merits , but he talks less than Benvenuto about himself . " " Our new friend is young , Lucilla . He has forced his way against rivalries and jealousies . It is for us to teach him how to win his place without so much aggression . " " I like him , " she admitted shyly . " With Pompeo , I never know whether or not his words ring true , but no one could doubt that Benvenuto means exactly what he says . Sometimes he seems oblivious to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sincere they embarrass me . " The old man chuckled as he kissed her . " Yet because you know he means them , you forgive him his audacity . " " Yes , " she acknowledged slowly ; " yet I wish he would leave praise of his work to others . " Chapter IX  - -  B ENVENUTO was scarcely installed in his new quarters in the Del Moro shop when Cardinal Cibo summoned him to the Palace . On his arrival he was at once taken into the presence of the Pope . Clement greeted him with a grim smile . " Has Salamanca given you further commissions ? " he inquired . " Not as yet , your Holiness ; but others have been more generous . " The Pontiff laughed . " I would not wait for him if I were you . They tell me that the Bishop fancies your craftsmanship better than your manners . In the meantime , I have in mind to employ you upon a piece of great consequence , where you will be able to exhibit all your talents . " Benvenuto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prodigious moment , " he replied . " You will have need of all your self-assurance , Benvenuto , " Clement answered , eying him sternly , " and all your skill . My intention includes nothing less than a morse for my priest 's cope . Upon this I want you to represent a God the Father in half-relief , and in the middle to set this magnificent diamond , together with these other gems of great value . Carodosso began to make me one , but did not complete it . " " I am amazed that your Holiness should have even thought that Carodosso could execute such a piece , " Benvenuto remarked , as he examined the magnificent gems the Pope handed him . " But of course you were not then familiar with my skill . " " If you can make for me a model that will match your boastings , " Clement exclaimed , " I shall be content indeed . " 6566 DAGGER AND JEWELSAgain the artist felt himself unjustly estimated . " Boastings , most holy Father ? " he repeated soberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and the charge grieves me . How can I be arrogant when I speak only of what I know I can perform ? " The Pope regarded the youth critically . There could be no question of his sincerity . " It remains for you , Benvenuto , " he answered more kindly , " to turn your boastings into facts . " Clement was right when he said that a morse offered marvelousopportunity for a real artist to show his skill . Its size made unusual demand for perfect composition , and the prominence of the clasp , when used in front to hold the cope together and keep it from slipping off , caused it to be the ornament most favored by prelates of the Church . This commission to the new favorite was not passed by unnoticed by other goldsmiths of the Court . Ten days after Benvenuto began work upon the model he received a call from Michele , who had a reputation for engraving carnelians . " Good morning , " he greeted his young rival with seeming friendliness . " I have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer my assistance . The Court has many pitfalls for youthful feet , and , if you were to show me your model , I might perhaps save you from making a mistake . " Benvenuto was not deceived by the ingenuous manner of his visitor . " It is by these very bruises that one learns to avoid greater difficulties , Messer Michele ; but I thank you for your interest . " " Then you will not show me your model ? " " With pleasure , Messer Michele  --  in the presence of the Pope . " " Of course you realize that his Holiness has given you this commission simply to free himself from his earlier promise . You might perhaps have succeeded with a lesser piece . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 67 " I might perhaps succeed with this , beyond your ex-pectation . " Michele was angered . " We shall see , " he cried , " if in the Pope 's Court presumption is to take the place of skill . " " Since ignorance in the requirements of Art now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " perhaps his Holiness will find presumption an agreeable substitute . " Lucilla came into the workshop from the garden in time to hear the end of the quarrel , and as Michele passed angrily through the door she looked questioningly at Benvenuto . " The insufferable idiot ! " the youth exclaimed , " to think he could hoodwink me with such a flimsy trick ! " " Why are you both so angry ? " she inquired . " Michele is a clever engraver , and my father thinks highly of his work . " Benvenuto was unappeased . " He should stick to his bench , and not try to interfere in my afairs . " When she heard the whole story , Lucilla 's sympathies were with Benvenuto . " I am surprised by what you tell me . Michele is a friend of Pompeo 's , and I believed him above such trickery . " " Are you in love with this Pompeo ? " Benvenuto demanded abruptly , forgetting his antipathy against Michele . " Why  --  no , Benvenuto . I love no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For no reason at all , " he answered lightly . " Will you go with me some day to the Villa Chigi , and see the frescoes and the garden ? " " Of course I will , if you think Madonna Porzia will receiveme . " " Madonna Porzia is my friend , and so are you . Naturally my friends are welcome at the Villa Chigi , " he said with decision , as he returned to his interrupted work upon the model for the Pope 's morse. 68 DAGGER AND JEWELSMichele took his troubles to Traiano , the Pope 's first chamberlain . " What you tell me is no surprise , " Traiano observed . " I overheard his Holiness telling some of the Cardinals how this upstart Benvenuto insulted Salamanca . But the Pope likes him , Michele . You must move fast but carefully if you would keep him from supplanting you and my nephew Pompeo . " " I must see Pompeo , " Michele replied . " Together we will outwit this overweening upstart . " Benvenuto had no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lucilla the following afternoon . He had been working on his model all day , and welcomed Lucilla 's invitation to join her in the garden , where , beneath the shade of the fragrant mimosa , she discussed with him variousphases of Art , showing a knowledge and understanding that surprised him . When Pompeo approached , Lucilla introducedthem . " I am pleased to meet the famous Benvenuto Cellini , " Pompeo said in a tone the girl resented , but which conveyedno hostile message to her companion . " We have heard much of you at Court , and every one is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to see your model for the Pope 's morse . " " So Michele told me , " Benvenuto answered good-naturedly . " It is natural that this interest should exist . " " Benvenuto 's design is magnificent , " Lucilla exclaimed with an enthusiasm that annoyed Pompeo . " His Holiness is certain to be delighted with it . " Pompeo smiled suggestively . " Do you think so ? I wonder why he asked Michele and me also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the girl 's presence prevented an outburst . " I can scarcely believe that , " he remarked . Pompeo shrugged his shoulders . " You could hardly expect his Holiness to entrust to an unknown artist so important a commission as the fashioning of his morse . " Benvenuto saw that Lucilla was troubled by the turn the THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 69conversation was taking . " Oh , well , " he answered in perfect good humor , " two of us will have had the trouble for our pains . I am quite willing to leave the selection to the Pope 's good taste . Under the circumstances , " he added , rising , " I will take the liberty of covering my model until you leave . " " Has this Benvenuto become my rival with you as with the Pope ? " Pompeo demanded of Lucilla when they were alone . " You are no more and no less to me , Pompeo , than you have always been , " she replied quietly . " But why can not men get together without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father has taught me to love peace , Pompeo , and you bring conflict into my life . " " It takes two to make a quarrel , " he answered with a smile that frightened rather than reassured her . " If this impudent interloper learns his place , and keeps it , there will still be peace . If not  --  " " What would you do ? " she cried , alarmed . " So this brave Florentine , this courageous baiter of bishops , this super-goldsmith , requires your protection , Lucilla ! " I'ompeo said contemptuously . " I do not wonder , unless his swordsmanship be far better than his Art . " Before the girl could answer , Pompeo left the garden and stamped noisily through the workshop . Benvenuto glanced up from his work , wondering what Lucilla had said to cause his discomfiture , but too indifferent to inquire . Pompeo went directly to Traiano and related his experiences . " I have made a statement , uncle , which you must help me make good . Michele and I will fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange an audience for us with his Holiness before Benvcnutoagain sees him . " Traiano kept careful watch upon the Pope 's program , and learned when Benvenuto was to be summoned to the Palace. 70 DAGGER AND JEWELSThen he arranged for Michele and Pompeo to be admitted to an earlier audience . " We both have seen Benvenuto 's model for the morse , your Holiness , " Michele speciously declared , " and we consider it unworthy for a work of such supreme importance . " " We shall make ourselves the judge of that , " Clement answered . " If we find Benvenuto is not competent , we shall assignthe work to some one else who is . " " We have several excellent designs ready to show your Holiness , " Michele urged , eagerly starting to unroll them . The Pope restrained him . " We do not care to look at any , " he said sharply , " until Benvenuto has completed his . " On the next day Cellini appeared at the Palace , and requestedaudience with the Pope . Traiano delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent word to Pompeo and Michele , bidding them make haste and bring their drawings . On their arrival the three artists were admitted . Michele and Pompeo immediately unrolled their plans , which the Pope inspected . Both had placed the famous diamond in the middle of the breast of God the Father . Clement quickly observedthis mistake , and impatiently called to Benvenuto , who was standing at a distance , " Now show me your model , that I may see if you , too , have been so stupid . " The young artist stepped forward and opened a small , round box . As soon as the Pope 's eyes rested on the enclosure they flashed like lightning . " If you had been part of my own body , " he cried , " you could not have done it better ! You have shown me who are the braggarts . " Clement commanded Traiano to bring five hundred golden ducats . While waiting for the money , the Pope turned once more to gaze at the black stone model , on which , executed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem with the figure of God the Father . BenvenutoTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 71had placed the diamond exactly in the center of the piece , and seated above it was shown the noble figure of the Deity , lifting his right hand in the act of pronouncing benediction . Below the diamond , Benvenuto had placed three cherubim who , with their arms upraised , supported the jewel . Around the outside he grouped other cherubim in different attitudes , gracefully combined with smaller gems . From the folds of a mantle loosely draped around the figure of the Father , other cherubs peeked out . When the money came , Clement gave it to Benvenuto with his own hand . " Lose no time , " he exclaimedin great good humor , " in completing my morse from this magnificent design . " " Two of us have had our trouble for our pains , Pompeo , " the artist exclaimed exultantly , as he passed his rivals . " I knew your model would best please his Holiness , " Lucilla exclaimed when he told her of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming indifference . " How could the others expect to compete against Benvenuto Cellini ? " Chapter xN SPITE of his disclaimers , Benvenuto was pleased by Lucilla'sconfidence , for she interested him as no other girl ever had . A beautiful face , a graceful body , set his blood on fire , even while his artist 's soul received fresh inspiration in his own Art from this tangible expression of the Master 's handiwork . His models were his creatures , whose beauty was given them to serve the genius of the artist and the pleasure of their master . While they kept their place , Benvenuto loaded them with kindness , thus winning their affection and devotion ; let them presume to claim a like response from him , and they soon learned his true estimate of women . But Lucilla was different from any girl he had ever known . She met him with the familiarity of a man , yet he was always conscious of the reserve behind the freedom of their intercourse . It was constantly in his heart to beseech her to pose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion might destroy their friendship . He classed her in his mind with Madonna Porzia , and extended to these two women a respect no others in his life had ever gained . Raffaello smiled contentedly when he saw how much Benvenuto'spersonality had disturbed Pompeo 's assumed prerogativeas Lucilla 's suitor . To this extent the gentle craftiness of his great heart had succeeded ; but the youth proved as much an enigma to him as to the girl . The old man recognized the self-assurance to which Lucilla took exceptions , but the conceitwas so frank and honest that he found it less objectionablethan Pompeo 's courtly graces that covered a sinister and vengeful disposition . Benvenuto obviously enjoyed sharing with Lucilla the interesting experiences he had with Clement72 . THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 73and the various personages at Court . He took pride in making her acquainted with his friends , including Madonna Porzia and Gian Francesco . The companionship of the young people brought a new purpose into Raffaello 's life , yet he could discoverno understanding between them that promised the final outcome on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop was Diego , a handsome youth of perhaps sixteen years , who lived next door . Benvenuto called him his Antinous , because of his perfect figure and the attractive lines of his head . " You have a rival in this boy , " Benvenuto once said to Lucilla . " His beauty is second only to your own , and in woman 's clothes no one could tell that he was not of your sex . " " You should use him as your model instead of some girl , " Lucilla retorted unexpectedly , tossing her head in such a way that Benvenuto realized that some one had been telling tales . " Girls who traffic in their beauty are to be considered as any other kind of merchant , " he remarked casually . " A wise purchaser buys in the best market . " The happy days were broken when Lucilla suddenly fell ill . A disease attacked her right hand , and ate into the bones of two of the fingers . Benvenuto was much concerned . He lost interest in his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had engaged , and comforted the girl in her pain and anxiety . After several days the physician declaredthat Lucilla would lose her arm , and even suggested that her life was in danger . Raffaello despaired , but Benvenutobecame indignant . " It ca n't be true , " he declared . " I have watched this man , and I am convinced that he does not know his business . I beseech you , Messer Raffaello , let me secure another doctor . " Del Moro yielded willingly , and Benvenuto rushed off to Maestro Giacomo , of Perugia , surgeon to the Pope himself. 74 DAGGER AND JEWELS " Save this girl 's arm for me , " he besought him , " and I will fashion for you a seal that shall be second to none in the world . " Maestro Giacomo returned with him , and examined the patient with great care . " This case is not as serious as you have thought , " he declared . " I will remove a portion of the diseased bone , and after that I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness in the afflicted fingers . " Overjoyed , the girl submitted herself to the operation . The surgeon began to work with a coarse , steel instrument , and Benvenuto cringed when he saw the pain the patient suffered . " Cease but for a few moments , " he cried impulsively . Rushing into the shop , he quickly fashioned a small scalping knife of steel , thin and curved , and with a razor 's edge . " Try this , Maestro Giacomo , " he begged , as he placed it in the surgeon 's hand . " I believe it will save Lucilla some suffering . " Giacomo examined the impromptu instrument with curiosity . " This is a clever contraption , " he said admiringly . " With it I shall make myself the most famous surgeon in all Rome . " A few skilful , gentle strokes and the operation was completed . As the surgeon rose , he said to Lucilla , " You have Benvenuto to thank for that . I had not thought a goldsmith could instruct me in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucilla answered gratefully , " and I thank you , too . " " The seal shall be yours as soon as I can make it , " Cellini joyfully declared . " Forget the seal , " Giacomo answered , " but let me keep this clever scalping knife instead . I shall find it useful . " As the surgeon left , Raffaello grasped Benvenuto 's hand . " You have saved my daughter 's life , " he exclaimed gratefully . " But for you I should have listened to that ignorant charlatan . " " It is the end that counts , not the beginning , " BenvenutoTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 75replied , embarrassed by the old man 's emotion . " I could not see Lucilla suffer . " As he glanced over at the patient , the girl held out her unbandagedhand . " What can I add to what others have already said ? " she exclaimed , with an expression in her eyes that disconcertedhim . " Add nothing , " he answered quickly . " What I did was not uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hastily left the room . With Lucilla 's return to health , Benvenuto again settled into his regular routine . Gian Francesco often came to see him , and Madonna Porzia was a frequent visitor . Both these friends approved the new arrangements for his work , and were happy in the rapid progress the young man was making in his Art and in his friendships . " Madonna Porzia , " Benvenuto said to his visitor one day , " may I some time take Lucilla to the Villa Chigi , to show her the frescoes and the garden ? " " I shall welcome you with pleasure , " she agreed cordially . " I should like to know this lovely girl better . Is she a little disturbingto your peace of mind ? " Benvenuto stiffened as he replied with a dignity his friends thought scarcely warranted , " Art is my mistress , your Ladyship . So long as she receives my advances with such favor , I shall cleave only unto her . " " But Art is the one mistress who is not jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who knows how jealous any mistress can be of any rival ? " he replied evasively . Had Benvenuto spoken the whole truth he would have admitted that Lucilla seriously disturbed his peace of mind . He knew enough of women to recognize that the girl was attracted to him , but he was always conscious that she refused to take76 DAGGER AND JEWELShim at the valuation he placed upon himself . She never ohided him for his self-confidence , but , instead of agreeing with him as he expected , she passed over his pretentious statements with some laughing retort that piqued his vanity . " One word of praise spoken by a friend , " she remarked one day , after he had exclaimed over the beauty of his work upon the morse , " is worth a hundred uttered by oneself " ; and before he could protest or recover from his surprise , the girl fled from the shop . The chief reason Benvenuto could not understand Lucilla was that , although younger than he , she was essentially a child of the Renaissance , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wane . Daughters in other Roman families were subject to the changes brought about by the decline , but Lucilla had grown up surrounded by the atmosphere of her father 's youth . The old man had assimilated the Humanistic creed , which insists that all truth absorbed be given out again , enriched by personal interpretation ; and this credo he passed on to the girl as an expression of his own belief . Not only could Lucilla read Latin and Greek and play her lute , but she could discuss philosophy and religion . Her mind had as many facets and was as brilliant as Raffaello 's diamondsThe closeness of companionship between Lucilla and her father naturally made him the criterion by which she estimated her friends . Pompeo had brought a colorful echo of Court life into the quiet atmosphere of the Del Moro home , and she enjoyedthe acquaintanceship . The clever courtier exercised his most finished arts to persuade her to accept him as a suitor , but she instinctively distrusted him . Now Benvenuto had come into her life , and introduced her to quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank , honest approach to life which Pompeo lacked , but she resented his sublime concentration on himself . Raffaello might accept the exaggerated self-assurance as a characteristic which carries youth throughTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 77dangerous situations , but Lucilla was less generous . Because she admired Benvenuto 's other sterling qualities , she became more critical , and felt it a part of her friendship to assist in eliminating a disfiguring attribute . Benvenuto sensed all this without understanding it . He craved the girl 's affection ; but had this desire been gratified , he could not have been sure that he would have reciprocated it . To be loved would have satisfied his vanity , but the great adventure of loving was still beyond him . Chapter XI - SOMETIMES , to relieve his perplexities , Benvenuto made excursionsto the ruins just beyond the city walls to shoot pigeons , testing his marksmanship against the cleverness of the birds by fitting only a single ball into his fowling piece . At other times he bartered with the Lombard peasants , on their way to till the Roman vineyards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One thus acquired was a dolphin 's head , fashioned out of a magnificent emerald ; another , a priceless topaz , as large as a hazel nut , made into a Minerva 's head of inconceivable beauty . Still another was a cameo , engraved with a Hercules binding the triple-jawed Cerberus , of such beauty and skill in workmanship that the great Michelangelo , when Cellini unexpectedly had a chance to show it to him , protestedthat he had never seen anything more wonderful . These treasures , secured for trifling sums , together with the income from his Art , enabled Benvenuto to live in comfort , to provide for his father in Florence , and frequently to make a present to some Cardinal or friend that astonished by its prodigality . Benvenuto found another form of relaxation in a Bohemian club , to which Gian Francesco introduced him soon after his arrival in Rome . It included the best of the young goldsmiths , painters , sculptors , and men of letters , such as Giulio Romano , a favored pupil of the great Raphael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sienese sculptor who executed the mausoleum of Pope Adrian VI ; Francesco Bachiaccha , the famous painter of birds and animals ; and Aurelio Morani , who wrote such charming poems and epigrams . The meetings were held in the studios of the various members , and each host strove to outdo the others in making his entertainment the merriest and most unusual. 78THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 79When Bernardino 's turn came to act as host , he made elaborate plans to live up to the reputation he had gained as the most ingenious member of the club . Each guest was expected to bring with him his favored lady , under penalty for default of being sconced by paying the supper for the entire company . More than this , each member was to submit verses written by himself . Benvenuto had planned to escort the lovely Pantasilea , who had recently been his model ; but at the last moment the petulant beauty , resenting his indifference to her affections , sent him word that she had accepted an invitation from Bachiaccha . Lucilla happened to be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benvenuto 's maledictionsaroused her curiosity . " Read this , " he exclaimed , handingher the letter . " That conceited wench seeks to make me jealous , but I care no more for her than for a piece of metal that falls discarded from my bench . " " Then why let her disturb you ? " Lucilla inquired . " Because unless I take a girl with me to Bernardino 's party I shall be the joke of the evening , and shall also have to pay for the supper . I have not time to find a substitute . " Lucilla 's eyes danced at a sudden thought . " Take me with you , Nutino , " she entreated . " Let me be Pantasilea 's sub-stitute . " Benvenuto 's face sobered at the girl 's impulsive suggestion . " You do n't know what you are asking , " he replied . " This is not the kind of party for such as you , Lucilla , nor are the girls those I care to have you meet . " " Now you speak as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should men include in parties such as these girls whom I ought not to know ? " " It is for Raffaello to answer that question , rather than for me , " he answered frankly . " Men seek women to gratify dif-8o DAGGER AND JEWELSferent impulses . The girls at Bernardino 's party will be those who think lightly of their virtue . It is a compliment that I do not wish you to be present . " Lucilla was disappointed , but she had already questioned in her mind the possibility of securing her father 's consent even if Benvenuto had been willing . Then a new idea came to her . " Take Diego , " she cried . " You said yourself that were he dressed in woman 's clothes no one would recognize his sex . You and I could make for him a complete disguise . " Benvenuto looked at her for a moment , and then broke into a laugh . " Lucilla , you are a genius ! That is just the thing to do . The lad has so devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Let us call him in and see if he will be party to the plan . " Diego was promptly discovered , and he entered into the plot with enthusiasm . In the late afternoon the boy came to the shop , and Benvenuto undertook , with his confederate 's help , to transform him into a girl . Lucilla supplied a rich gown of her own , and added new beauty to the boy 's face by the elaborate dressing she gave his hair . Benvenuto clipped two small rings , set with pearls , on his ears , and draped his throat with golden chains and jewels . Rings were slipped upon his fingers , and his head was wrapped in a brilliant-colored scarf . " There ! " Lucilla cried , as she stepped back to survey their handiwork . " Did any one ever see a more beautiful girl ? I should indeed be jealous , Diego , if I did not know that you could never be my rival ! " " Look at yourself , boy , " Benvenuto exclaimed , pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection in the glass . " Can this really be Diego ? " he asked in such surprise that both the others laughed . " Were my parents to see me now they would not acknowledge me ! " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 81Benvenuto was in great spirits . " What a lark ! Come Diego  --  I must n't call you that  --  with your dark and ruddy beauty let it be Pomona ! Come , Pomona , let us be off . We will see what Pantasilea has to say of my new fancy ! " " At least you can tell me what happens , " Lucilla insisted as they departed . " I shall be thinking about your party even if I can not be there . " " I owe you more than that for suggesting this clever trick , " Benvenuto called back to her . When the two reached Bernardino 's studio the guests had already assembled . Their host , closely followed by Giulio Romanoand Gian Francesco , came forward to greet the late arrivals . As Benvenuto lifted the veil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of the face revealed . Bernardino placed his hands on the shoulders of Giulio and Gian , and forced them to bow low , while he , kneeling on the floor , cried out in sheer admiration , " Behold of what sort are the angels of Paradise ! " The false Pomona laughed merrily , and , lifting his right hand , gave Bernardino a Papal benediction . " It is the custom to kiss the feet of the Pope and the cheeks of an angel ! " Bernardinoexclaimed as he rose , seizing Diego in his arms and embracing him passionately . The unexpected salute caused the boy to blush deeply , which immensely enhanced his beauty , while Benvenuto made a show of anger at his host 's familiarity . This reception over , Benvenuto and his Pomona found themselves within the studio , surrounded by the other guests who had witnessed the tribute paid to Benvenuto 's companion . In Pantasilea 's cheeks burned livid spots of jealous red . To win hack his interest she had bedecked herself in a silk gown with crimson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lovely hair was laid a net of golden thread , worked out with pearls . Yet she knew that her own beauty was far eclipsed82 DAGGER AND JEWELSby the graceful , simply costumed creature who walked so proudly by Benvenuto 's side . " At least tell me where you discovered that chaste Diana , " Gian whispered to his friend . " I take it unkindly that you have kept me so long from knowing her . " Benvenuto laughed to find that even Gian 's penetrating eyes were deceived . " Trust me , Gian . You will forgive me when you know all . " The host commanded silence . " The verses have been examinedand verified , " he announced . " Each guest has fulfilledthe requirements . Now three shall be read . Who shall make the drawing ? " " Pomona ! " shouted several of the guests . The disguised Diego again flushed prettily . With mincing steps he walked up to the urn containing the verses , and drew . ) ne forth . He read : " There have been lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy .. . That they would sigh and quote with learned looks Precedents out of beautiful old books . " " The meter is much more to be commended than the thought , " Aurelio remarked , assuming a critical air . " Which proves that the verses were not of your conning , " declared Bernardino . " But I agree with Aurelio , " Bachiaccha said , looking at Pantasileawith a simpering glance . " Who cares to learn love out of a book when life offers so many fair instructresses ? " " What say you , Clarice ? " Giulio Romano asked the girl he had brought with him . " Should love be compounded of high courtesy , I ask ? " " I would much prefer the golden ducats you promised in exchange for my affection ! " she countered ill-naturedly . THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 83Diego appeared shocked by the girl 's suggestive words , and demurely covered his face with his hands . " This is no place to bring that innocent , " Gian said reproachfully to Benvenuto . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't like to see a young girl exposed like that  --  " Before Benvenuto could reply , Diego had recovered , and drew the second verse from the urn . This ran : " It was the season when the meadows green Are full of blossom , when the roses bloom , And birds are singing midst the flowers new , When first I saw thee . At that earliest glimpse My heart was rapt , and through my being sped , Moved by the power of thy most lovely eyes , Ice-cold fear mingled with my hot desire . " " That 's much better , " Bernardino exclaimed , nodding his head approvingly . " A touch of Nature combined with a throbbingof the heart , eh ? I can surmise the writer of those lines and the object of his passion , but I will be discreet . " " But it is written on paper marked with your own seal , Bernardino , " Diego announced naively . A shout greeted this disclosure . " Let us go on to the next , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Diego continued : " Shake og your heavy trance , And leap into a danceSuch as no mortals use to tread . Fit only for ApolloTo play to , for the moon to leadAnd all the stars to follow . " " Splendid ! " cried Bachiaccha . " That is an invitation to the evening that lies before us . How about supper , Bernardino ? " 84 DAGGER AND JEWELSAurelio demurred . " Not yet , I pray . " He dropped on one knee before Diego . " That line in Bernardino 's verse about lovely eyes ' inspired me to improvise in honor of our wonderfulPomona  --  " ... Beauteous eyes , Gracious eyes , amorous eyes and dear , More lovely than the stars or than the sun , And unto me .. . Dearer than life itself or mine own soul . " " Oh , Benvenuto , " the masquerader cried , returning to her escort , " hold me tight lest I lose my heart to this gentle poet ! " " Now let us turn from Pallas to Bacchus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be brought in . With cheerful bantering on all sides , the company sat down at a table adorned with fruit and flowers . Giulio was asked by the host to place the guests . Gallantly taking each girl by the hand , he arranged them upon the inner side , surrounding Diego . Then he placed the men on the outside , with Benvenutoin the center as a mark of honor . Behind the girls was a trellis covered with lovely natural jasmine , and the deep foliage and starry blossoms made a perfect background to set off their beauty and the brilliant colors of their costumes . Bernardino had designed a piece de resistance that called forth a hearty round of applause when his servants placed it on the table . On a huge platter stood an octagonal temple with columns , resting on a floor of varicolored jelly to resemble mosaic . The columns were sausages to look like porphyry . The desk for the choir was made of cold veal , and the singers were roasted thrushes , standing upright with open beaks , and clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in state , THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 85was a plump pigeon attended by roasted ortolans , to represent the Pope and his Cardinals . " Bernardino has done more to reestablish Leo 's Court than Clement himself , " Aurelio commented approvingly . The merry supper was followed by a concert of delightful music , the guests joining their voices in rollicking popular songs . Diego took prominent part , singing in a soprano voice far sweeter than any of the others . The company was so astonishedthat Giulio and Bernardino dropped their earlier tone of banter , and regarded the accomplished guest with the deepest admiration . Diego found himself sitting next to Pantasilea . During the entire evening Benvenuto 's former favorite had watched with increasing jealousy and rage the satisfaction he took in revenginghimself upon her fickleness . Never doubting that Diego was a girl , and staggered by her beauty , Pantasilea tried to discover who she was . At last Diego found the questions becoming too personal , and was embarrassed for his answers . Wishing to escape , he twisted restlessly upon his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with seeming sympathy . The false Pomona continued to show signs of discomfort . " A little , " he admitted , concealing his amusement behind a grimace of pain . Then the spirit of mischief seized him , and , leaning toward Pantasilea , he whispered , as if in confidence , " Do n't tell any one , but I think I am a month or so with child ! " Pantasilea sprang to her feet in vindictive fury . She rushed at Benvenuto and tried to attack him , but Giulio Romano and Bernardino held her back . " So this is the innocent Pomona you have brought here as a pattern for the rest of us ! " she cried between her jealous sobs . " This is the simple little song bird you now keep in your golden cage instead of me ! " 86 DAGGER AND JEWELS " What is this feline person trying to tell us ? " Giulio demanded . Benvenuto was equally at a loss to understand what had caused the outbreak . Diego approached demurely and snuggled closely in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was soon to become the mother of your child . Should I have kept it secret ? " Gian turned sharply on his friend . " I understand now why you have kept her to yourself , " he declared angrily . " I only wish I had discovered her first ! " Giulio Romano and Bernardino were aghast at the thought that this beautiful innocent was Cellini 's mistress . When the excitement had reached its height , Benvenuto , with a sudden movement , removed the ornaments and coverings from Diego 's head , disclosing him as the boy he was . This surprise was the climax of a bewildering evening . Benvenuto'smocking laughter alone relieved the tension , but the other guests soon joined in the hilarity . At length Bernardino called for silence . " As host , I claim the right to pronounce sentence upon this miscreant who has so disturbed our peace of mind . " Raising his glass he cried , " Long live Cellini , who has broken our hearts but has perpetrated the merriest joke our club has ever witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire company joined in the applause except Pantasilea , who was left alone for the moment to nurse her humiliation . Benvenuto received the plaudits with satisfaction . When the noise subsided he bowed to her with mock gallantry . " It is only fair , " he said , " that Pantasilea should stand godmother to my child . " As the guests retired , Benvenuto remained behind , keepingan eye on the weeping girl . When he saw Bachiaccha approach to comfort her , he stepped forward . " I am takingTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 87Pantasilea home , " he said with a significant tap on the handle of his poniard , in a voice from which all good nature had vanished . " Then you do love me ? " she cried , smiling through her tears . " It is an insult for a strumpet like you to speak of love , " Benvenuto answered brutally .

" Chapter X I IWHEN , NEXT day , Benvenuto related to Lucilla what he chose to tell of the events of the evening , he was surprised to find that she found no humor in Diego 's prank , and even expresseddisgust over the whole affair . " You may keep my gown and add it to the dresses for your models , " she said . " I shall never wear it again . " " Why are you offended ? " he demanded . " It was all a jest . You make too serious a matter of it . " " I am not concerned with the jest itself , " the girl replied with feeling . " I am thinking of what it represents . At your party last night were gathered the most gifted artists in all of Rome , to whom has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In my father 's time , the great masters perceived and reproduced what was nobly beautiful . The goal of present artists seems simply to achieve skill in reproducingthe flesh rather than the spirit of the human form ; and they seek for inspiration in orgies such as this . " " You are unfair , Lucilla , " Benvenuto protested . " An artist is also a man , and seeks his pleasures like other men . " " The greatness of any man is shown in his ability to substitutethe spiritual understanding for the physical in the interpretation of his ideal , " she insisted . " Petrarch had his Laura , Dante his Beatrice . " " You speak in words I can not comprehend . " " It is that lack of comprehension against which I protest , " she told him . " I do not seek to discredit you , Nutino . Your attitude , alas , is the spirit of the times . I am rather thanking God that my father gave to me , before too late , the standards of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke 's mis-syTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 89tress Aphrodite , but that does not make it such . The faithless wife of Andrea del Sarto may pose for the Madonna , but the Blessed Mary still remains a thing apart . Who now is able to depict the subtleties of emotions except the great Michelangeloor Tintoretto ? Paganism has replaced the Christian ideal , and we have no more that poetry and faith which is the real source of life . " Benvenuto was sobered by the girl 's intensity . He had complacentlyaccepted present conditions as an advance over the bast , without taking the trouble to analyze them . He tried to recall some name or some artistic achievement with which to refute Lucilla 's argument . " What of the great Raphael ? " he demanded . " A product of the Golden Age , " she admitted promptly ; " but even so a harmonizer of classical and Christian traditions rather than an idealist . Even his great genius might have felt t be degrading influence of present tendencies had he lived . " " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked incredulously . " In execution , Nutino , no artist has ever equalled you , " I , ucilla answered . " If I might lead you to add to your consummateskill those ideals which come only from the soul , I should in great measure pay the debt I owe to Art . " Benvenuto was bewildered . " It is beyond my understanding , " he declared . " Your beauty has been an inspiration to me since the first day I saw you . You have stirred in me a desire to put into my work exactly what you say it lacks . " " Until you do understand , my friend , you can not change , " she said with a tinge of sadness . " When men look at me , Nutino , even with respect , I am conscious that they are attracted by the grace of my figure ; when my father regards me , he sees such beauty as my body possesses through the idealizing eyes of his soul . " 90 DAGGER AND JEWELSAfter Lucilla left him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a respite from his disturbing thoughts . A week later the Pope sent a chamberlain , commanding the artist to bring the morse to him , that its progress might be inspected . Benvenuto responded at once , and as he walked along with his companion , the well-disposed chamberlain became confidential . " His Holiness has more in mind than merely to see the morse , " he said . " I overheard him say that he intended to entrust to you the making of the dies for his new coinage . Perhaps I should not have spoken , but to know this in advance gives you opportunity to prepare your answer . " " Yours is a friendly message , " Benvenuto replied gratefully . " I shall not forget your kindness . " During these passing months Cellini had become more than merely a goldsmith at the Papal Court . The youth 's fearlessnesswas in such marked contrast with Clement 's own timiditythat the Pontiff felt strengthened by contact with it . The long-drawn-out struggle between France and Spain was more deeply involving Italy , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-prepared . Francis , deceived as to the strength against him by the brilliant victory he won at Marignano , had persuaded Rome that his was the banner to espouse , and now that Spain was showing greater strength , the Pope was perplexed as to the proper course . Leo had been able to carry water on both shoulders . Clement tried to emulate his famous cousin , but , lacking an equal ability , he found the equilibrium often threatened ; and the complications that ensued weighed heavily upon his temper . Clement often found his new protege a trial as well as a diversion . Benvenuto failed utterly to appreciate the respect due to a Pope . To him , Clement was as human as himself , and he considered that Benvenuto Cellini stood much higher among artists than Clement ranked among earlier pontiffs . ComingTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 91into such close intimacy , he recognized that the heavy tiara and the magnificent cope , waiting to be adorned by his splendidmorse , were but outward insignia of high position . Some-t imes he even pitied Clement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beneath the priestly garments surged the red blood of a man , hungry for the beauty and thrill of life enjoyed by the lowliest of his subjects . Denied this , the Pope must find relief for his imprisoned vitality by creating new splendors , while his duties as Vicar of Christ conflicted with his responsibilities as temporal Sovereign . When the chamberlain introduced the artist to Clement 's presence , Benvenuto lost no time in exhibiting his golden plate , upon which he had as yet engraved only the figure of God the lather ; but this , though only in the rough , displayed a far grander style than that of the waxen model . The Pope 's ill temper was placated by the promise it gave of exceeding his expectations . " Were you as clever a courtier as you are goldsmith , Benvenuto , you would be the most valued member of my Court . You have exceeded every promise you made for my morse , but I can not accustom myself to your impudence . " " I am no courtier , your Holiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as conceited because truth is so seldom spoken that it is unfamiliar to your ear . I can not change my nature , but if my frankness offends you I will confine my conversation to matters of my Art ! " " That is what I have in mind at this moment to discuss with you , " Clement replied , mollified by the honesty of Benvenuto'swords . " Would you feel competent to make dies for the coinage of my realm ? " Cellini smiled . " Have you so soon forgotten the beginnings of the morse , your Holiness ? I have not only courage to attemptthis new commission , but ability to execute it . " At this levee there happened to be present Messer Tommaso , 92 DAGGER AND JEWELSof Prato , who was the Pope 's Datary , so called by virtue of his position as chief secretary of the Office for Petitions and Patents . Tommaso was a great friend of Traiano , and as such was hostile to Benvenuto . " Most blessed Father , " he remarked with seeming humility , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make him promise you a new world . You have already committed to him one great task ; now , by adding a greater one , you are likely to make them clash together . " Clement resented this attempt to influence him . " Tommaso , " he said sharply , " you may know how to conduct the matters of the Datario , but this is our affair . " Then turning to Benvenutohe commanded , " You are to make for me a model for a doubloon of gold , upon which I will have a naked Christ with pinioned hands , and the inscription Ecce Homo . On the reverse I wish you to place a Pope and an Emperor together , in the act of propping up a cross which seems about to fall . " After the Pope had ordered this coin , Bandinello , the sculptor , joined the group . " I will at once supply a drawing , " he said with characteristic presumption , " so that this goldsmith may properly carry out the magnificent idea your Holiness has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not require your drawings for my Art . It is my intention to give your Art some lessons by my own designs . " Bandinello was furious at the rejoinder , but Clement smiled indulgently . " Go now , Cellini , " he said , " and devote this fiery spirit to our service . " Returning to his shop , Benvenuto quickly made two dies of steel . Later he stamped a coin in gold , and one Sunday , after dinner , took both the coin and the dies to the Pope . When Clement saw the piece he was greatly pleased , not only because the work was exactly what he wanted , but also becauseTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 93of the promptness with which it had been executed . Benvenuto also brought with him several old pieces of money which had been made by earlier artists for Popes Giulio and Leo . Clementexamined them all with great care . " This coin of yours , " he said at length , " is finer than any one of these . You deserve a rich reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Feeling certain that your Holiness would make some expression such as this , I had a patent drawn up , ready for your signature , which will make me Stamp Master in the Mint . I trust that I have acted as your Holiness would have me . " Clement regarded Benvenuto curiously , holding out his hand to receive the paper which the artist drew from his pocket . Then he laughed at the ingenuity of his goldsmith . " You think of these things even before I do myself , " he chuckled . " This post is worth six golden crowns a month in addition to the dies , for which you will receive a ducat for every three . It is not too much , Benvenuto . " The Pope handed the patent to the Datary , telling him to lose no time in putting it through . Tommaso started to place it in his pocket . " Most blessed Father , " he said , " your Holinessought not to move so fast ; these are matters which deserve reflection . " Clement scowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he commanded . Signing it with his own hand , he gave it again io Tommaso . " Now your last objection is removed , " he said curtly . " See that you put the patent into effect at once , for this is our pleasure . " " Your Holiness can boast of having a currency superior to any of the ancients in all their glory , " Benvenuto acknowledgedhis act gratefully . " Cellini , for his part , " the Pope rejoined , " can boast of serving a Potentate who is able to discern his merit . " 94 DAGGER AND JEWELSDuring this intervening period Benvenuto had not forgottenLucilla 's criticism of him and his contemporary artists , but she seemed to cherish nothing against him for his continuedlack of understanding . This new commission , and these further evidences of the high esteem in which the Pope held him , added weight to his conviction that what the girl had said was only an idealistic expression of those vagaries which are a part of women . To be sure , Lucilla 's intellect was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His Holiness finds in my work a message from my soul which to you is silent , " Benvenuto said suggestively to her when he announced his latest triumph .

If you approvedmy work as others do , I might even be disposed to ask you to become my wife . " The girl flushed at his patronizing tone . " I approve your work far more than I do your manners , " she replied bluntly . Benvenuto looked at her in complete surprise . " Why should what I say offend you ? " he asked . " I intended my words to be a compliment . " " You think too highly of yourself to marry , Nutino . A wife should be to her husband a bulwark against his own misgivings , a strength in times of adversity .

" Until you seek and find that understanding which still is lacking , " she answered , " you have no right to ask that questionof any woman . " " You alone of all who know me fail to recognize me for what I am , " he persisted with a dignity born of his chagrin ; butTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 95his resentment was short-lived . " We must still be friends , Lucilla  --  the best of friends , " he added , returning to the mood she loved . " Tomorrow I shall take you to the Villa Chigi . Perhaps Raphael 's Jove with his thunderbolt will shock me into understanding ; perhaps his Cupid will whisper some helpful messages to you ! " Chapter X I I ITIE VILLA CuICI and its beautiful garden , to which MadonnaPorzia 's reset lily served as passport , had long since become sanctuary to Benvenuto , but this was the first time he had ventured to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure fresh inspiration from the splendid frescoes decorating the ceiling of the great hall which opened out on the garden , between the two projecting wings , and running into the pendentives and spandrels , designed by Raphael for his generous patron , Agostino Chigi . Sometimes he strolled through the glorious avenue lined with box and laurel , to the terrace overlooking the Tiber , recalling Lucagnolo'sdramatic story of the sumptuous and extravagant entertainmentsgiven by the famous Sienese banker to Pope Leo in that very garden . Sometimes his eyes reveled in the superb view of the ancient stone buildings of the city , set off against the green slope of the Janiculum . Sometimes he would dream for hours in the flower garden laid out to the left of the walk , made more impressive by the square-cut box trees and enclosed by a high wall with niches , in which stood charming antique statuettes . This protected cloister formed a welcome retreat from the activity of the city outside , and Benvenuto was pleased that Madonna Porzia should choose this spot to receive Lucilla and himself after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are very welcome here , my dear , " the older woman greeted the girl graciously . " I hope Nutino did not unduly emphasize the punishment that comes to woman 's curiosity when he showed you our lovely but irrepressible Psyche ! " Lucilla laughed . " The sheer beauty of the artist 's work96THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 97makes one lose interest in the story , " she answered . " All my life I have wished to see these frescoes . Your Ladyship has made it possible to gratify that desire . " " There is no reason why you should not see them as often as you wish . Familiar as I am with each individual figure , I am always discovering some added beauty . " " That is a characteristic of the great Raphael 's work , " Benvenutosuggested . " The more remarkable in this case since the designs alone are by the master , " explained Madonna Porzia . Benvenuto was surprised . " That is news to me , " he exclaimed . " I wonder some one has not told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do not know ? " she asked , incredulously . " Raphael completed the Galatea with his own hand , but for the Myth of Psyche he finished only the designs . Romano painted a part , but the work is mostly by our own accomplished Gian Francesco . " " Gian executed those glorious frescoes and never speaks of it ! " Benvenuto cried . " An unusual example of becoming modesty , is it not ? " she laughed . " But that is why we so love Gian . He leaves to others the praise he might rightly claim . " Benvenuto glanced uncomfortably at Lucilla , but the girl appeared oblivious to the personal application . " Gian has been a wonderful friend to me , " he remarked , " just as your Ladyshiphas been . You two , with Lucilla and her father , have made Rome seem even more like home than Florence . " " Nutino would be at home wherever he might live , " Lucilla demurred . " He has many friends beyond those he has Mentionedto your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would stoop to be a courtier . " Madonna Porzia raised her eyebrows inquiringly . " Why98 DAGGER AND JEWELSspeak so contemptuously of a courtier , my friend ? A true courtier seems to me the noblest work of God . " Benvenuto looked at her , amazed . " Tell us what , in your eyes , is a true courtier , your Ladyship , " asked Lucilla . " Must he be of noble birth ? " " Not as an essential , " Madonna Porzia answered , " yet naturally that is a great advantage . He must have valor and skill in arms , yet must never be the bravo . He must have beauty of face and limb , perfected by manly exercise , such as horsemanship , fencing , hunting , and the like . The grace which comes from this rare combination must not be marred by selfconceitor boastfulness . Why , Nutino , Gian , whom you admireso much , is the most perfect courtier I know . " At this Lucilla could not resist glancing at the perturbed Benvenuto . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same picture she herself had tried in vain to make him see ! Knowing how sensitive her friend 's nature , she hastened to divert the conversation . " As against the true courtier , your Ladyship , how would you describe the true woman ? " " Ah ! That is not so simple an undertaking ! " Madonna Porzia exclaimed . " We women know what we admire in men , but could we ever reach an agreement on the perfect attributes of our own sex ? " " Wisdom , prudence , magnanimity  --  " Lucilla suggested . " Yes , " Madonna Porzia granted , " and a lively wit , an engagingpersonality , persuasive words , an understanding heart  --  " " All this is interesting , " Benvenuto interrupted , " but it grows too personal . In your picture of the courtier I see myselfby contrast ; in your portrait of the perfect woman , I see only Madonna Porzia and Lucilla .

If in your personal analysis you discover attributes that mar the beauties I have mentioned , what greater privilege than , of one 's own accord , to pluck them out ? " Lucilla could have shouted for joy . Fearing lest some later word might destroy the effect of Madonna Porzia 's message , she rose to say good bye . " To know the frescoes of the Villa Chigi , " she exclaimed , " is an inspiration ; to know Madonna Porzia is a gift from God . " " You precious child !

What would be self-conceit or arrogance in another is a part of my very nature . If I plucked it out , as she suggests , my life blood would come with it . It hurts me to disappoint you or Madonna Porzia , but God made me as I am . " Yet he was chastened by his experience . Lucilla said nothing , but it pleased her to see the efforts he made to be less aggressive and less self-centered . Perhaps because of this his enemies seemed for the time to have lost their initiative . He lived comfortably and tranquilly in his house behind the Banchi ; he executed his increasing commissions in Del Moro 's shop with little interruption ; his friends gave him their affectionand esteem ; in the Palace of the Pope he enjoyed the prerogativesof a favorite . To Benvenuto , who had looked upon conflict as essential to progress , it seemed as if this period of calm must mean retrogression in his work. ioo DAGGER AND JEWELSStill , unknown to him , he was living over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The confidences extended by the Pope gave him only one side to every question , and left him wholly unaware that the cauldron in which history is made was boiling furiously . He knew that Clement favored France ; but so did he , and for reasons of his own . Reports came to Rome of the dazzling Court at Fontainebleau and Paris , and of the French monarch 's patronage of Art , while Spain was said to be more concerned with war and politics . Had not the great Leonardo been a recipient of the favors of King Francis ? Some day , perhaps , when Italy became too small an arena for the expression of his genius , Benvenuto himself might elect to go to France ! He was vaguely interested in the seven-year struggle betweenthese two alien nations , but it had not occurred to him that his own fair Italy was the prize at stake . If Clement himselffailed to understand that underlying these hostilities was the same great spiritual movement which was equally convulsingthe Church , how could a youthful goldsmith possess deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Pontiff never forgot that he was a Medici and a Prince of Italy , when he might well have subordinated these secondary interests to the cause of Catholicism and of the world . From his position of proximity to the Pope , Benvenuto learned something of Morone 's League of Freedom and the League of Cognac . He knew instinctively that , somehow , through association with these , Clement hoped to gain relief from his anxieties , which increased daily . For his own sake , Benvenuto wished well to both these movements , not realizingthat by supporting them Clement broke his covenants with Spain . Then came the news from Pavia : the Spanish troops victorious , King Francis on his way to Madrid as prisoner , and the Constable of Bourbon , traitor cousin of the GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI roiFrench King , reported on the march against Rome ! Benvenuto saw the look of fear come in the Pope 's face , and for the first time realized that his own peaceful days were at an end . He felt the love of conflict surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal recognition . " This means war with Charles , my Benvenuto , " Clement remarked apprehensively . " In my blood runs the valor of the great captain Fiorino of Cellino , most holy Father , " the young man declared proudly . " I can fight as well as I can fashion in gold . How best can I serve your Holiness ? " " You may well exchange your chisel for an arquebus . Fool that I was to accept Salviati 's advice to dismiss Gonzaga 's levies and the Swiss troops ! Rome lies today as defenseless as a new-born babe . " " Not with me here , your Holiness , and the friends I can rally about me , " Benvenuto insisted stoutly . " I am not a novice in fighting .

Cellini feverishly cast aside his goldsmith 's tools , thanking God that the skill he had developed while shooting pigeons outside the walls was to stand him in good stead in the defense of his adopted home . He saw little now of Clement , but the timorous spirit of Prince Alessandro , the Pope 's nephew , embraced him as a tower of strength . " We are going to have a sweet fight , " Cellini declared exultantly . " My palace will be the first attacked , " complained the Prince , thinking only of himself .

" Are you not pleased to know that I am as great a soldier as I am goldsmith ? " " All was going so well , " she answered , filled with misgivings . " The bravo in you had wholly disappeared , and the braggartwas nearly under your control . " " You do n't like me as a soldier , eh ? " " I hate you when you assume that old-time swagger .

" " We shall set out at once for Florence , " Raffaello replied . " If Bourbon is actually approaching Rome , neither life nor property will be respected . We must leave our home , Lucilla , " he said sadly to the girl . " We must forsake the city of our birth , and from a distance witness the final act in the collapse of the Augustan Age .

" Raffaello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son . Clement has invited it by his own timidity and vaccilation . Now Rome must pay the price . " " You must lose no time in getting away , " Cellini urged . " While we are parted , I ask you to impress upon Lucilla that this is no time for gallantries . I love her , Raffaello , but she tries me sorely . Teach her from your wisdom that man is ever master over woman , and that while I fight for her it is her place to cherish my affection . " " Lucilla is no Sabine woman , " the old man reproved him , " to be seized and borne away regardless of her will . " Benvenuto shrugged his shoulders indifferently . " Oh , well ; we shall see .

" At this moment of our separation can you not forget your self-conceit ? " " Take away from me that which you call my self-conceit , Lucilla , and what have I left ? But a part of that conceit is that you love me . Deny it if you can ! " By the time Cellini rejoined his men at Alessandro 's house , Bourbon 's army was reported already within sight of the city , and Benvenuto urged the Prince to accompany him upon a reconnaissance . When they reached the walls by the Campo Santo , the vanguard of the enemy could he seen . Upon the ramparts lay bodies of men who had already been killed by scattering shots from the approaching army , and in the midst of a dense fog a desperate battle began to rage . Cellini regarded the scene with calm satisfaction . " Let us return ! " Alessandro cried in alarm ; " there is nothing we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our men are in flight . Would to God we had never come ! " As he started to run , Benvenuto seized him roughly by the arm . " Since we are here , " he insisted , " I must perform some action worthy of a man . Get behind that corner where you will avoid being hit , and watch me . " Then he pointed his arquebus towards the troops , and , taking careful aim , fired at a figure which stood above the others . Alessandro , seeing that he was not exposed , gained courage , and discharged his own piece blindly . After his shot Cellini crept cautiously to the wall , and looked over . Confusion was apparent among the soldiers , and a cry went up , " The Constable is killed ! " Benvenuto raised a shout of triumph , and , grasping AlesTHEGORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 105sandro by the arm , quit his position on the ramparts . " Now we may go , " he exclaimed , intoxicated with joy . " We have done our part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blow at Spain which will not soon be forgotten ! " " It was my shot that killed Bourbon , " Alessandro asserted boldly . Benvenuto could not dispute the question of precedence with so important a personage as the Prince . " Oh , well , " he retorted good-naturedly , " one of us shot Bourbon . I shot somebody . Being so good a shot as I am , I am still rather inclined to think that I shot Bourbon ! " They crossed the Campo Santo and entered the city by Saint Peter 's . Coming out at the Church of Sant ' Angelo , they reached the gate of the Castle with great difficulty . By this time a part of the enemy had already succeeded in forcing an entrance , and the bullets , which spattered against the walls of the houses , encouraged the fugitives to seek the quickest shelter . The Castellan of Sant ' Angelo had just ordered the portcullis to be lowered , and in doing this cleared enough space to enable them to get inside . The moment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Papal household , and , in spite of Alessandro 's timorous protests that Benvenuto belonged to him , Pallone conducted the new recruit to join the fighting forces . Well pleased with this competition for his services , he hastened to the keep . As he did so , he met the Pope , accompanied by Cardinal Colonna , coming in through the corridor which joined the Palace to the Castle . The Cardinal had thoughtfully thrown his violet mantle over Clement 's white stole , to prevent the enemy from recognizing the illustrious fugitive . Benvenuto had felt much concern regarding the safety of his Holiness , and was relieved to find that he had at lastio6 DAGGER AND JEWELStaken shelter in the Castle . Detaining him for a moment , he recounted his adventures on the ramparts , adding , " It is well , most holy Father , that you have left the Palace , for the enemy is just behind us . You must have heard the shots as Alessandro and I barely crept in under the portcullis . But have no fear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope seemed confused , and paid no attention to Benvenuto'sattempt to reassure him . " I was on my knees in the Chapel , " he murmured . " I heard the cries of the dying , and , as I came through the corridor , I looked through the little windows , and saw Bourbon 's rabble butchering my people in the street . " A shudder ran through his body . " What will be the end ? " he cried . " What will be the end ? " As Clement passed on with Colonna , Cellini found himself attached to a piece of artillery , which , although in position to work damage against the enemy , was held in check . Amazed at this inaction , he rushed up to Fiorentino , who was in command . Tears were running down the bombardier 's cheeks . " Look ! " he exclaimed , pointing through the opening in the wall , through which the piece was trained . Turning in the direction indicated , Benvenuto saw one of the houses being sacked , and soldiers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my home , " cried Fiorentino . " That is my own wife and family ! If I order the discharge of this cannon I shall destroy my own flesh and blood ! " " You are too timid , " Cellini exclaimed . Assuming command himself , he aimed the swivels and falconets with such accuracy that he killed several of the enemy without injuring the helplesswoman and children . Fiorentino was spellbound . " You are the most wonderful gunner in the world , " he cried in admiration . " Not only have you saved my family , but the confusion that shot occaTHEGORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 107sions will delay the enemy long enough for us to prepare an adequate defense . " By morning , some sense of order was established inside the Castle . Pope Clement and his Cardinals were housed in the most protected portion , with such comforts as could be afforded . Antonio Santacroce , captain of the gunners , placed Cellini in charge of the artillery on the Angel , the highest point of the Castle , with rations of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the circular eminence , and surveyed his advantageous position with satisfaction . He was not a general yet , but the siege had been in force only twelve hours , so he must contain himself in patience . Lucilla and her father by this time were well on their way to Florence . Lucilla ! What a strange girl she was to be disturbed by what she called his self-assurance ! If she could see him now she would be proud to acknowledge his mastery ! The enemy were in complete control of the city , but it would require great deeds of valor to reach those besieged within the grim walls of the Castle while Benvenuto Cellini was in command of his pieces of artillery ! In spite of his disdain for danger , Cellini came near destructionfrom the action of his own men . A cannon shot from the enemy struck the angle of a battlement , and broke off a mass of masonry . This hit him full in the chest , and stretched him upon the ground as dead . A surgeon made a quick examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a handful of wormwood , which he had previously soaked in Greek wine . He laid this upon the bruise on Benvenuto 's chest . Almost immediatelythe wounded man regained his scattered faculties , but when he endeavored to speak he found himself choking and sputtering . While the surgeon was securing the tile , some of the soldiers , believing Benvenuto dead , had filled his mouth with earth ! " Imbeciles ! " he cried indignantly , when he reio8 DAGGERAND JEWELScovered his power of speech . " You imagined you were giving me the sacrament , but you almost succeeded in accomplishing my excommunication ! " Much concerned over the accident to Benvenuto , Pope Clement conversed with him soon after his recovery . " We are in the wolf 's jaws , " he exclaimed moodily . " He will gulp us down unless we make good our flight . I am sending a courier to Urbino in Venice . " The envoy was to beseech the Duke of Urbino for assistance , and to tell him that each night three beacons would be sent up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon , thrice repeated , to signify that the Castle had not yielded . Clement commanded that Benvenuto be charged with the lighting of the beacons and the firing of the guns , for this gave his Holiness greater opportunity for companionship , and helped to relieve the monotony of the siege . He was bored by the quarrels and repinings of his Cardinals , and spent much time with his fiery captain , watching him perform his many duties . The Pope grumbled over his restraint . He cursed Spain and France with equal vehemence ; he criticized the delay of the Duke of Urbino in language quite unbecoming to a churchman , but which Benvenuto found in complete sympathy with his own sentiments . Thus the little company , besieged within the Castle of Sant ' Angelo , settled down to await what was in store for them , with no certainty as to what their fate might be . The Duke of Urbino never came . Clement may have suspectedthat Francesco Maria della Rovere had not yet forgotten the act of Pope Leo in depriving him of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recalled the hatred of the House of Rovere for the House of Medici , but in his dire distress he believed that , as General of the Church , Urbino 's loyalty would rise above his personal feud . By thatTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 109estimate the Pope paid the House of Rovere a compliment , for he knew well that , were the case reversed , no Medici would lift a hand to relieve the plight of any member of the rival family . So the siege wore on , the soldiers bravely defending the Castle , and the thirteen Cardinals continuing their quarrels among themselves . Cellini carried himself well , and won continued commendation for his marvelous skill in marksmanship . Just outside the Castle there was a tavern , called Baccanello , which bore on its sign a sun , painted in bright red . Late one afternoon , General Orazio Baglioni came up to Benvenuto . " If you think you can hit that wall an ell 's breadth from the sun with your demi-cannon here , " he remarked , " I believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great commotion there , and men of importance are probably inside the house . " " Nothing easier , my general , " Cellini replied with confidence ; " but you see that barrel full of stones , standing close to the muzzle of the gun ? " " Of course I see it , " Orazio replied impatiently . " I ask you to direct your aim upon the center of that sun , not on the gabion . " " The shock of the discharge will surely cause the barrel to fall , " Benvenuto insisted . " It should be removed . " " Lose no time , " the general commanded . " The discharge of the cannon is not likely to bring the barrel down ; but even were it to fall , and the Pope himself were underneath , no mischief would result . Fire , I command you  --  fire ! " Benvenuto glanced around and saw that Cardinal AlessandroFarnese was standing below , in angry discussion with Messer Jacopo Salviati , a lifelong enemy of the Cellini family . The Cardinal was accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their troubles by having advised Popeno DAGGER AND JEWELSClement to dismiss the five bands of soldiers , which left Rome defenseless and encouraged the Constable of Bourbon to attack . Why should , Benvenuto hesitate ? His general had ordered him to fire , and if an accident resulted it might even serve its purpose ! Without further delay he discharged the cannon , striking the sun exactly in the center ; but the barrel fell as he had predicted , and struck just between the two gesticulatingchurchmen , so that both barely escaped serious injury . " Bravo ! You have hit your mark ! " Orazio shouted exultantly . " My aim was only half accomplished , " Cellini replied , smiling grimly ; but the general took the answer to be nothing more than words of becoming modesty . Farnese was so incensed by his narrow escape that he immediatelysent his men to punish Benvenuto . Seeing their purpose , he trained two falconets upon the staircase , shouting , " Death to any one of you who advances ! Go tell the Cardinal , your master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " But General Orazio , terrified by the anger of the Cardinal , disclaimed the order , and started up the staircase as if to apprehend Benvenuto . Enraged by this seeming perfidy , the young captain turned the gun full in his direction . " Just as I have proved to you that I can defend the Castle , " he cried , " so will I prove that I can defend myself . " The general hesitated a moment and considered . " I must see you , " he said in a moderated voice , " for your sake as well as for my own . " " Then come alone , " Cellini replied , withdrawing the gun , but keeping his hand upon his sword . Orazio advanced , laughing at his young captain 's threateningattitude . " Benvenuto , " he exclaimed when they were out of hearing of the others , " I bear you as great love as I have in my heart to give . Would to God you had killed both thoseTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI iiirascals  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other because he will be the cause of something even worse . " " Then why did you deny that you gave me the order to fire ? " " From both fear and judgment . Except for my deceit , Farnese would have had me boiled in oil . He can do nothing to you because the most holy Father is your friend , even as I would be . " Cellini could not resist the engaging manner of the general , and , joining with him in laughter over the closeness of a happy tragedy , the two passed on to the Angel to secure the latest news of the battle in the streets . The Pope also laughed heartily when Benvenuto told him of the misadventure . " Next time , " he advised slyly , " make sure of the aim of the barrel , and let the artillery take its course ! " Benvenuto frequently thought of Lucilla when lulls in the fighting gave him breathing spells , but he no longer repeated to himself his earlier desire to have her see him in action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butchery had reached a point where it became revolting . He took pride in the reputation he had achieved , he received the Pope 's commendationwith satisfaction ; but he knew that this glorious adventure of his life was not one that would win favor in Lucilla 's eyes . He thought , too , of Madonna Porzia , and the visit he and Lucilla had with her at the Villa Chigi . She admireda courtier . Yet it was her own idealized courtier who appealed to her , not those like Pompeo , who used their graces to conceal their evil natures . And Madonna Porzia 's courtier must be free from self-conceit and boastfulness  --  like Gian ! Benvenuto was still staggered by his friend 's self-restraint in withholding comment on his superb work upon the Chigi frescoes . There could be but one explanation  --  Gian himself did not realize how great an artist he really was ! For CelliniN. 112 DAGGER AND JEWELSto disclaim his own ability when he knew its merit would be the height of affectation . As the weeks went by , Clement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor would demand in making settlement . This caused him to take thought of the tiaras and priceless jewels of the Apostolic Camera . Charles had knowledge of the collection , but not of the individual pieces , and whatever portion Clement could conceal from the princely plunderer he might preserve for the Holy Church . Calling Cellini to him one day , Clement led him to a secret room in the Castle , and laid before him all the jewels of the regalia . " My morse remains unfinished , " he said kindly , " but I give you again the chance to be my goldsmith . I trust you with my honor in placing this affair in your hands . " " You could have chosen no more worthy confidant , " Benvenuto answered , flattered by this continued mark of Clement 's favor . " It seems sacrilege to destroy such masterpieces , but in happier days you may rely upon me to restore them to even greater beauty . " Still in the Pope 's presence , the jewels were taken from their settings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the linings of Pope Clement 's clothes . This left but the gold itself , no less than a double hundred-weight , which Cellini secretly conveyed to his own lodgings in the Angel . Once there , he bolted the door to be free from interruption , and prepared himself for his work . He built a small draft furnace of bricks , with a largish pot shaped like an open dish at the bottom of it , and threw the gold onto the coals , watching it gradually sink through and drop into the pan . Later , by the Pope 's orders , he stamped out coins with which the soldierywere paid . Even while engaged in this important work , Benvenuto never ceased from annoying the enemy . While the gold wasTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 113melting , he would slip to the window from time to time , inflicting no little damage with his swivel and falconet . Towardthe end of an afternoon , he came to his window just at the moment when an officer was riding along the trench . The mule was trotting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trenches . Cellini took careful aim and fired , striking the rider in the face . Instantly a tremendous uproar arose . Pope Clement heard of the affair , and came to inquire into the circumstances . Benvenuto told his story , adding that the officer must have been of some importance , because the inn to which they carried him was immediately filled by the chiefs of the army . Later , word came to the Castle that this was none other than Philabert , Prince of Orange . With shrewd instinct , the Pope sent for Santacroce , and bade him direct all pieces of artillery in one mass upon the inn , and to discharge them simultaneously , judging that if the officers could be killed , the army would be panic-stricken . When all was in readiness , and the signal for firing about to be given , Cardinal Orsini rushed to the Pope , saying that the plan must be abandoned . The enemy were on the point of concluding negotiations , he declared , and , if the officers were killed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm the Castle and complete its ruin . Clement , with characteristicindecision , put his hands to his head in blank despair . To avoid the necessity of settling the affair , he departed hastily , saying that he left the conclusion to the Cardinal . Orsini promptly countermanded the order , but Cellini , before he could be hindered , let blaze one of his demi-cannons , and did so much damage to the enemy that they hastily evacuated the inn . Orsini , enraged by what he considered Benvenuto 's defiance , demanded that he be hanged at once ; but the Pope was secretly much pleased , and took his part with spirit . " II14 DAGGER AND JEWELSshould have deputed you and not Orsini to settle the dispute , " he whispered to his dauntless champion . A few days afterwards , the articles of truce were signed . Cellini delivered to the Pope the gold he had melted down , and received for his services Clement 's heartfelt thanks and a purse of twenty-five crowns . What pleased him most was an expression of regret from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recompense . Had Benvenuto known how heavy was the indemnity the Emperor exacted , he would have wondered that the Papal treasury could have produced even the small number of crowns the purse con-tained ! With this paltry sum to reward his services to Mars , Cellini left the Castle of Sant ' Angelo , saddened by the sights of carnage and of utter ruin . What had become of Gian Francesco ? Whither had Madonna Porzia fled ? What had the future in store for Pope Clement and for him ? Benvenuto was convinced that the Pontiff could never exercise his Papal functions without him . His heart might be filled with anxious forebodings , but he held his head high and hummed a martial air as he strode valiantly along , looking neither to right nor left . What if he had not saved Rome as he had promised ? Single-handed he had slain Bourbon and incapacitated the Prince of Orange . He even admitted to himself that had his companions-in-arms all been Benvenuto Cellinis the outcome must have been quite different ! 6Chapter x vR OME WAS indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resistless prey of thirty thousand rapacious Spanish brigands , without even the restraining control of a single leader . The panic-stricken citizens , robbed of their manhood by years of luxury , shuddered impotently at the wails of assaulted women and the groans of tortured men , while drunken beasts roamed the streets , singing ribald songs and wantonly destroying the monuments of antiquity . Raffaello del Moro was right when he predicted to Lucilla that the Sack would mark the end of the Augustan Age , but no one could have foreseen the depth of suffering and despair that came to men of letters who had been the intellectual glory of their epoch . Colocci , the collector , died of grief after witnessing the destruction of his museums and manuscripts ; Marco Fabio Calvi , Raphael 's friend and instructor , went insane when forced to be present during tortures inflicted on his servants ; Baldus , after listening to the raucous laughter of the soldiers as they used the handwritten sheets of his great Commentary on Pliny to light their camp fire , was left to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . Those who could , fled beggared from the bedeviled city ; those who failed to escape barely existed in their suffering , or found relief in self-destruction . By the time Benvenuto came out from the Castle of Sant ' Angelo the lecherous rabble had been withdrawn , and Rome was weakly raising her tortured , bleeding head . The Pope was now at Orvieto , whither he had escaped the night before the truce , still awaiting the final settlement of the Emperor 's score against him . Day by day the disheartened citizensn5rib DAGGER AND JEWELScleared away the wreckage left by their persecutors , and made feeble efforts toward rehabilitation . Cellini wandered about the city , seeking news of friends , pondering over what step to take next , and rejoicing that Raffaello and Lucilla had left Rome in time . Gian Francesco , he learned , had escaped to Mantua , where he was in the service of the Duke ; and Madonna Porzia was in Siena . One evening Benvenuto sauntered into a wine cellar , and discovered his general , Orazio Baglioni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orazio , who never forgot how well his youthful captain had served him in asssuming the brunt of Farnese 's anger , greeted him noisily , and pulled him down upon a vacant stool . " Well , my fighting cock , " he exclaimed heartily , after presenting him to Ser Pier Maria del Lotto , " what are you minded to do now that there are no Bourbons or Philaberts on whom to exercise your uncanny marksmanship ? Will you return to the gentler art of goldsmith ? " " Art has become a stranger in Rome , " Benvenuto replied gloomily . " Then remain a soldier and sign up with me , " urged Orazio . " I will make you captain of one of my companies . " The general recounted to Del Lotto some of Cellini 's valiant exploits during the siege of Sant ' Angelo . When the story was ended , he clapped Benvenuto upon the back . " Come with me , " he repeated . " I do not ask a better officer . " " I have first in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florence , " Benvenuto replied , pleased by the proposition made by Orazio ; " but at present there is a ban against me , published five years ago by the Council of Eight . " " Was yours a serious offense ? " Del Lotto inquired . " Nothing but a street brawl  --  a buffet that I gave a cowardly lout who called himself Guasconti . " " You have stumbled into the right stall , " Orazio laughed . THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 117 " Behold in me the newly appointed General of the Florentines , and Del Lotto is Envoy from the new government of Florence . Between us we can surely serve you well . " Benvenuto grasped Orazio 's hand and shook it warmly . " You are indeed my friend , " he cried . " But what new government is that you speak of in Florence ? " Del Lotto explained . " The Medici are again expelled , and Niccolo Capponi is now Gonfaloniere of the reestablished Republic . " Benvenuto was astonished by the news . The present eclipse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . Cellini 's sympathies were with the Medici , but the shifting politics of his native city had played small part in his life . Three times the Medici had been expelled and twice they had returned . They would again return , he doubted not . It was Orazio who broke the silence . " Del Lotto will give you letters to the Nine , of which your fellow-artist , Michelangelo , is a member , to prove that you have worthily worked out your salvation , " he assured him . " Go on to Florence , Cellini . Renew the ties that bind you to your family and friends , and then join me wherever I may be . Your commissionawaits you . " Armed with Del Lotto 's credentials , Benvenuto left Rome . He sighed to think that not a single tie remained . Did the return to the city of his birth mean a permanent renunciation of all that Rome had meant to him ? Did Orazio 's offer mean that he had fashioned his last piece , that he had worshiped the brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to him , yet Clement 's morse remained unfinished , and something within him called loudly for an expression he could not make with arms . His mind was filled with uncertaintybut with no misgivings as he rode toward Florence , still clad in military garb , and followed by his serving man. 118 DAGGER AND JEWELSAt all events , he was determined to return home , after these five years , in greater state than when he left . And Lucilla was in Florence ! Had she waited for him as he admonished her ? He was not as confident now as he had been when he left her . She had not denied his challenge that she loved him , but she was always doing the opposite of what he expected . Lucilla ought to be impressed by his feats of valor during the Sack . She ought to recognize that he had proved himself worthy to be her master . " Ah , well ! " he sighed as doubt persisted . " If she is still unreasonable that will be her own loss . " Benvenuto went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation of recounting his adventures . For a time there was no answer to his knock , but at length the door opened , and a misshapen harridan greeted him with a torrent of abuse . " Listen , you cross-grained hunchback , " he retorted , " this is the house of Giovanni Cellini . I am his son , and I seek my father and my sister . " The vixen glowered at him . " You 'll not find them here , " she declared shrilly . " This is my house , and it belongs to no one else . " " Is there no other face to see except your ugly countenance ? " " No , " she snarled ; " and bad luck to you ! " Benvenuto seized her roughly by the wrist . " It will not take long to fix that face so that it will never vex me again , " he cried , incensed ; but his violence was checked by the voice of a neighbor who had been attracted by the dispute . " Do n't waste your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be since you say that you are Giovanni 's son .

He had always expected that , no matter how forgetful he might be , his faithfulfather would be awaiting him with fond embrace whenever he chose to return home . He made his way to the inn , but before he reached it he felt a hand placed on his arm , and Piero Landi gave him an enthusiasticwelcome . " Nutino ! Is it really you ? I heard rumors you had returned , and came to seek you . We heard that you were killed in the Sack , and have mourned you as dead . " " Not wholly dead , " Benvenuto reassured him , smiling grimly .

" I should find less difficulty now in plucking those hairs you had me pull in Fra Alessio 's cell ! " " Dear Piero ! " Cellini again embraced him . " It was your friendship then that gave me courage , and you can never know how much I needed it . Those ten crowns were golden coins indeed , for they helped me to gain foothold . Now I return them , Piero , " he added , drawing a purse from his doublet , and presenting it as he had seen Pope Clement rewardsome favorite , " not as a gift , but as a loan bearing full interest .  --  Nay , do not refuse me .

" Now we may return to the happiness of our former friendship ? " " I see two roads beckoning to me , " Benvenuto replied complacently , " and either one leads on to greater glory . I can return to my goldsmith 's work , or I may continue as a soldier . My general , Orazio Baglioni , has already appointed me a captain , and I may soon turn to the enlisting of my company .

" " Any one may be a soldier , " Piero protested , " but who else can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of your work in Rome , Nutino . They say you are one of the greatest goldsmiths in the world . " " Why mention the others ? " Benvenuto laughed . " But if you asked Orazio Baglioni , you would learn that I am asTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 121great a soldier as I am goldsmith . But I shall weigh your words with care , Piero . My decision is of too great moment to the world not to be given grave consideration . " " You must stay in my home while you are here , " Piero urged . " I will gladly do so , " he accepted ; " but I am not sure that I shall be in Florence long . " " Florence needs you , " Piero pleaded . " The Medici are exiled , the new Republic is striving for existence . Even the great Michelangelo has come back to serve our city in her need . " Piero 's words recalled what Orazio had said . If Michelangelohad come to Florence , then Art must have followed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Benvenuto replied . " I do n't know yet whether it is Florence or Rome that I shall call my home , but at present I am here . " Piero came to a halt in front of a modest dwelling . " This is Aldobrandi 's house , where Cecchino lodges , " he said . " I will see if he is here . " A moment later the two brothers were in each other 's arms . " And where is Liperata ? " Benvenuto inquired after the long embrace . " I have a surprise for you , even as I have for her , " Cecchino answered . " She thinks you dead and you think her married to Bartolommeo . Here you are very much alive , Bartolornmeo is very much dead , and Liperata is even now married to a second husband . " " The surprise is more favorable to you than to Bartolommeo , " Piero suggested , as he started to leave the brothers together . " Do n't forget , Nutino , my home is awaiting you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benvenuto related to each other their wonderful adventures since last they met . As they passed a grey-bearded old man , Cecchino nudged his122 DAGGER AND JEWELSbrother . " Do you remember him , Nutino ? That is Antonio , who was once of the Council of Eight . " " Do I remember him ? " Benvenuto laughed . " It was he who would have sent me to the gallows , and told our father that his will was God 's will ! I must seek him out and tell him what God has since willed , and of Orazio 's favor . I must tell him ! " As they entered the door of their sister 's house , Liperata looked fixedly at Benvenuto in amazement , and then fell senseless in his arms . Her new husband showed a disposition to demand an explanation from the newcomer , but Cecchino quickly made peace . When Liperata recovered from her faint , she embraced her brother with passionate affection , shedding tears for her father and sister , for Bartolommeo and a little son whom she had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By mutual consent they talked no more of the dead , but rather of the happiness of their reunion . The prodigal was by no means displeased by the impression he found himself making , nor was the effect lessened by the vivid description he gave his breathless audience of the excitingevents in which he had been the central figure . They listened in gaping admiration and approval . Cecchino and Liperata insisted so strongly that Benvenuto should stay in Florence that Piero 's urgings were given added weight . " I am still considering , " he answered . Then he asked , " Have you by chance met with a Roman goldsmith named Raffaello del Moro ? He escaped here with his daughter just before the Sack . " " There are many Roman exiles here , " Cecchino answered . " There is a goldsmith with a name like that who recently established himself at the Mercato Nuovo . " " It must be the same . He was most kind to me in Rome , and I must look him up . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Market , and there found Del Moro 's shop . Once within the door , he discovered the old man working at his bench . The passion for his Art returned as he found himself surrounded by the familiar objects , and he knew at that moment that he could never desert the career his God had chosen for him . So absorbed was Raffaello that he did not realize any one else was in the room until he heard the words , " Master , have you in this shop a place for an apprentice ? " Raffaello turned , not recognizing the voice , but when he saw the familiar figure he stumbled excitedly to his feet . " Benvenuto  --  my son , my son ! " he cried , embracing him warmly . " Lucilla 's confidence has been confirmed ! " Tears of joy gathered in the old man 's eyes , and Cellini was deeply affected by his emotion . " The greeting which I thought denied me from a father , you have given , " he acknowledgedsimply ; " but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We heard that you were dead . I have mourned your loss , but Lucilla has steadfastly refused to believe that anything could happen to you . " Benvenuto was deeply impressed , and smiled complacently . " I knew I was right , " he exclaimed . " This must convince her that , however much I fall below her standard of perfection , I am a veritable part of her existence . How else could she feel my living presence ? " Raffaello seated himself deliberately . He was face to face with the great question , and he murmured a silent prayer for guidance . He understood the fabric of the wall standing betweenthese young people better than they did themselves . Until the report of Benvenuto 's death he had not been wholly convinced of his daughter 's sentiments , but her reaction at that time and since left no room for doubt . " If you approachI24 DAGGER AND JEWELSLucilla now with that word of assurance on your lips , " he cautioned him , " you will destroy forever the true affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does she still cherish that absurd resentment against what she calls my self-assurance ? " Benvenuto asked . " All men have weaknesses , Raffaello  --  perhaps some have faults even worse than mine . " " I wonder if it lies within my power to make you understand , " the old man questioned . " As between Lucilla and yourself , which do you love the more ? " Benvenuto looked at him steadily , sobered by his query . " I love Lucilla better than any woman I have ever known , Raffaello , but I must admit that I love myself more than any woman . " " Now you have hit upon the explanation of your mystery , " the old man declared . " It is not your attribute of self-assurance that stands between you and Lucilla , but rather the significanceof that conceit . Love , my son , rises above and beyond all thought of self . You are attracted to my daughter , but your own words tell me that your heart has not as yet been touched . Were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious than self-assurance , it would count as nothing in Lucilla 's love . The one demand her devotion makes would be a like surrender . That you have never made . " Raffaello had succeeded in getting his message across . The belated understanding came to Benvenuto , and at last he realizedhis own responsibility . " Can there be an affection so utterly unselfish ? " he asked in a chastened voice . " Can any man so love a woman as to subordinate himself ? " " The fact that you can ask the question proves the futility of argument . Until your heart has taught you that personal surrender and sacrifice may become a privilege , you have not learned the nature of that emotion the world calls love .  --  ButTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 125enough of this . Now that you are in Florence , will you come back to my shop ? I have already declined association with your former rival , Pompeo , but with you it is different . " " Pompeo ! " Benvenuto exclaimed . " What of Pompeo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival . He has been here since . " Cellini 's face darkened for a moment , then his features relaxed . " I was going to ask you how Lucilla now felt toward Pompeo , but what you tell me of her sentiments toward me is in itself an answer . " " I have told you that she has a true affection for you . I have tried to make clear the obstacle that stands between you . But in answer to that confidence , my son , analyze your own heart . Until you are convinced that you love Lucilla more than yourself , you must respect her affection by not presuming on it . " Benvenuto made no direct reply , but his long silence encouragedthe old man to believe that his words had not been spoken in vain . " I will gladly come into your shop if you will let me , " the youth answered at length , lifting one of Raffaello 's chisels and fingering it affectionately . " I have missed my tools as you have missed your Rome . Tonight I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons will seek to reconquer what may be my world . " " That will bring joy to my heart , Benvenuto . I shall not feel so keenly this exile from my beloved Rome . " " When may I see Lucilla ? " " Our new home is on the via de ' Bardi , " Raffaello answered . " You will go there with me now , and we three , as so many times before in Rome , will sup together on our loggia , looking up the Arno to the hills beyond instead of feasting our eyes upon the Roman Campagna . " Chapter X V ILUCILLA had found Florence less irksome as a city of exile than had her father . Even in Rome her life had been centered in her music , in her books , and in her thoughts . Here the only change was the environment . With the shop now separated from the house , there was a greater demand upon her own resources ; but this proved no hardship . During her father 's absence she often chose some favorite volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the loggia , and then , with the lovely vista spread out before her , discover a more absorbing story in her own mind as it dwelt upon memories of the past , happenings of the present , or formed dreams of the uncertain future . In these introspective thoughts Benvenuto figured conspicuously . The colorful life and enthusiasm the youthful goldsmith brought into her father 's shop in Rome had awakened something in Lucilla that previously had lain dormant , and which remained unsatisfied without him . During those earlier days she shared with him the unusual adventures that made up his everyday life . In his recital of encounters with patrons , rivals , friends , or even chance acquaintances , she found life woven in a new , highly colored pattern which proved stimulating . This was now lacking . Pompeo 's presence in Florence had been the great trial she had to bear . When Bourbon 's army appeared before the walls of Rome , members of the Papal Court who were not protected in the Castle sought refuge in other cities . Learning of Raffaello'sdeparture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own sanctuary until Clement reestablished himself and restored conditions at the Palace . He begrudged Ben-i16THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 127venuto this opportunity to improve his standing with the Pope , but the fortunes of war reciprocated by placing him in a similar position of advantage with Lucilla . The girl , however , distinctly resented his presence . His willingness to desert Rome when exposed to peril confirmed her distrust , and turned her indifference into dislike . This Pompeo failed utterly to comprehend . His previous love affairshad made him more familiar with the romantic climbing of a mimosa tree beneath his inamorata 's window , or the graceful ascension of silk ladders suspended from their balconiesby demure damsels with dreamy eyes . Lucilla 's type was new to him , and he could not believe her repulses due to anything other than a passion already kindled by Benvenuto . This conviction incited him to greater effort , for his pride demanded a revenge which seemed always to elude him . He gloated over the news of the soldier artist 's death in the Sack . This solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tidings to Lucilla , and her reaction confirmed his convictions . With a low moan she cried , " I do not believe you . Nutino 's God would not so utterly desert him ! " and rushed abruptly to the protecting sanctuary of her room . For a week she refused to receive him , and during that time put herself through a pitiless self-examination . That the contradictionsin Benvenuto 's character had exasperated her was not to be denied . She recalled his gentle solicitude during her operation , which drew her to him , and then her cheeks flushed with mortification as she remembered his churlish indifference to her advances . She thought of the day when , as she watched his work , the chisel in his hand conveyed such an appealing message that she almost cried out in ecstasy , only to be repelled the next moment by the childish temper that hurled the cup across the shop because a single line had failed to please him. 128 DAGGER AND JEWELSLucilla 's injured pride bitterly resented Benvenuto 's parting boast that he possessed her love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to crush forever any semblance of fact which might prove them true . Except for Pompeo 's persistence she might have succeeded , but her loyalty to her friend was stimulated by his rival 's subtle animosity . Pompeo 's specious words of sympathy did not deceive her . She felt his cowardly satisfaction while watching her swimming eyes and trembling lips as she received the news . Lucilla 's exclamation had been an impulsive reaction in defense , yet , as the days passed , she came to know that instead of being simply a heartfelt hope , it was a fixed conviction . Benvenuto 's self-confidence had justified itself in his accomplishments ; his superstitious faith in his partnership with God no longer seemed absurd when she recalled the many instances when this faith alone had carried him through perilous situationsthat would have destroyed a weaker man . Surely the God who protected him in his private feuds would not desert him while engaged in the defense of her beloved Rome ! What greater evidence of unselfishness could a man give ? What had Pompeo done to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she assured herself , was impossible , but a new demand was placed upon her friendship . Pompeo might resent the exaltation of spirit which convincedLucilla of Benvenuto 's safety , but Raffaello rejoiced . He did not share her obsession , and sincerely mourned the loss of one upon whom he had come to look as son ; but no matter how unwarranted his daughter 's confidence , it saved her from grieving , and raised another obstacle to Pompeo 's unwelcome suit . The girl turned to her father for relief , and in their communionRaffaello discovered the depth of her feeling for Benvenuto . So long as the old man never expected to see the youth again in life , Lucilla 's attitude made little differenceTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 129except in its effect upon herself , but Cellini 's sudden reappearancenow altered the situation . Raffaello had done his best to impress upon him the importance of subordinating those attributes which had caused misunderstanding . Lucilla 's loyalty and constancy entitled her to that . If he had failed , he could do no more . Benvenuto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allay his apprehensions . " We shall find her in the garden , " Raffaelloconfided to his companion as they entered the house . " This is the hour she devotes to the care of her flowers . It will be a happy surprise , Benvenuto , but we must break the good news to her gently . " The old man left him in the ante-chamber as he stepped out through the open door . " Lucilla ! " he called , trying to keep the tell-tale excitement from his voice . " Over here , my father , " Benvenuto heard the answer in the low , rich tone of welcome , yet tinged with irritation . " Come and see what has happened . Some one 's foot has trampled down this lovely rose and broken it quite off . Who could have been so careless ? " " Forget your flowers for the moment , Lucilla mia , " Raffaelloanswered , embracing the girl as she approached him . " I have wonderful news that will atone for the misfortune to your garden . Your faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nutino  --  not dead ! " she repeated , as if making sure she heard correctly , swaying so unsteadily that her father held out his arms . " He is in Florence  --  he is here now ! " The color returned to her blanched cheeks , and her face lighted radiantly as she turned toward the door where Benvenutostood , and ran quickly to meet him . As he raised to his lips the hand she extended , she cried impulsively , " My prayers130 DAGGER AND JEWELSwere answered after all , Nutino ! Your return heals the wounds left in the hearts of your friends . " " If that report left a wound in your heart , Lucilla , you are generous in forgetting my last , ill-mannered words . " She flushed as he referred to their parting . " I recall only those experiences which gave me happiness , " she said . " My father has missed you much  --  " " And so have you , " Raffaello chided her . " Why not admit it freely , Lucilla ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have missed Nutino , " she acknowledged ; " but as yet I am unsettled by this happy resurrection from the dead , and express myself with difficulty . " The strain upon all three was severe , and the old man felt it most of all . " Let us ascend to the loggia , " he said abruptly , leading the way to the house . " Benvenuto has much to tell us that we wish to hear . I have restrained myself from asking questions , Lucilla , that you might share the news . " The Del Moro home on the via de ' Bardi was backed by the steep Hill of Bogoli , and , from the spacious loggia in front , the setting sun glorified the reflection of the picturesque , irregular buildings on the southern bank in the molten water of the Arno . " This is more beautiful even than the Campagna ! " Benvenuto exclaimed as the view lay spread before him . " Perhaps , my son , " Raffaello sighed ; " but it is not Rome ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long period of turmoil had made him almost forget that such tranquillity existed . The affection extended by this foster father , and the bitterly frank words of counsel spoken so obviously in his interest , placed a new value on filial relations . Lucilla was even more beautiful than he remembered her , and her gracious willingness to forget their past differences placedTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 131a further guard upon him . Was Raffaello right ? Could a man so love a woman as to set her above himself ? Gradually Benvenuto unfolded his story of the experiences within the Castle , and of conditions in Rome after Bourbon 's horde had wreaked its vengeance . The telling extended through the evening meal and well into the hours beyond . The moon rose , and now the brilliant coloring of the Arno became more mellow , and the detailed reflection of the buildingsmere shadows . It was the same story he had told Liperata and Cecchino and Piero Landi , yet how different ! In the presence of this old man who had cautioned him against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own deeds were distasteful , Benvenuto could not indulge himself in vainglorious expressions . Raffaello recognized his restraint and rejoiced in it ; Lucilla saw in this new attitude an evidence that at last his blind spot had been touched . " Such horrors ! " she exclaimed , covering her face with her hands ; " and yet , Nutino , " she added , smiling happily , " living these weeks amid these bestial conditions , you have learned self-control . " " You credit me too much , " he answered quickly . " War is not a school where such as I should be instructed . " " Gian Francesco could not have been more modest in recounting what the world must know were your achieve-ments . " " This is from respect to your desires , Lucilla , and Raffaello 's , " he insisted . " In my heart is still satisfaction for what I am and what I have accomplished . I am acting the part of Madonna Porzia 's courtier , while in truth I am still the bravo . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raffaello murmured . " I knew him well , Benvenuto . He spent his life and fortune on his museums and collections . He died of torture , not of grief . " 132 DAGGER AND JEWELS " We must forget the past , my father , and think only of the present , " Benvenuto urged him . " Tomorrow , Lucilla , I shall lay aside these symbols of war and resume my goldsmith 's work . Your father permits me again to share his shop . " The girl 's face lighted with pleasure . " Then you will stay in Florence  --  " " Yes , Lucilla , " Raffaello answered . " Benvenuto and I await the return of order in our beloved city . Until then we pursue our labors here . " Chapter X V I I  --  THE WEEKS that followed made Benvenuto forget the horrorshe left behind in Rome , and lose all interest in what happenedthere . Florence was the city of his birth , and a return to it made his heart beat faster . All that remained of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a brother , gave to him the fullness of a friendship that had no equal . Raffaello filled the void left by his father 's death , and supplied a constructive companionship in his Art which helped him to reclaim his cleverness of execution . And Lucilla was happy , which meant that his efforts to enslave his temper and to modify his aggressiveness , though not wholly successful , had not been made in vain . The patronage of Art at this time in Florence was sluggish , but Benvenuto 's reputation brought him some commissions . Among his earliest patrons was the highly cultured Girolamo Marretti , who had previously lived in Turkey . Marretti wanderedinto the shop one day and ordered a Hercules wrenching the lion 's mouth , to be fashioned on a golden medal to be worn on the hat . Cellini devoted such infinite pains to the design that the attitude of the figure and the fierce passion of the beast were executed in a style quite different from what any craftsman had previously attempted . Raffaello complimented him , and Marretti was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Michelangelo , to see it . This in itself was an event , but when the master recalled the previous meeting with Benvenuto , and expressed surprise to find him in Florence , the young artist was agreeably flattered . " It was in Rome that you showed me that wonderful antique cameo you purchased from the Lombard peasants , " 133134 DAGGER AND JEWELSMichelangelo said genially . " That , too , had a Hercules upon it , but , if I remember , there was a Cerberus instead of a lion . " " Your memory , maestro , is as extraordinary as is your genius , " Benvenuto answered . " You are quite right about the antique Hercules , which was indeed a marvelous example . In this medal here I have ventured to try an experiment . I hope that it meets with your approval . " " It is cleverly done , " Michelangelo commented frankly , as he turned the piece in his hand . " This happens to be a branch of Art with which I am not familiar . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action within a space so limited seems well-nigh incredible . You must let me return to watch you at your work . " " That would inspire me to produce my best , " Benvenuto exclaimed eagerly . Piero Landi was already almost as much an accepted member of the Del Moro family as his friend , for his sterling qualities appealed equally to Raffaello and Lucilla . The girl loved to watch the effect of Benvenuto 's dynamic energy on his more static companion , and admired the quiet but effective restraining influence of Piero 's unobtrusive counsels . " Why do you give Benvenuto so much and ask nothing in return ? " Lucilla asked him one day when they were by themselves , in order to gain his reaction . He looked at her , astonished . " Nutino gives me far more than I could ever give him . Have I not his friendship ? " " No more , Piero , than he has yours . " He smiled at the ease with which he could refute her . " Ah , yes , Lucilla ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landi . " Lucilla watched Benvenuto 's struggles to maintain his new poise , made more apparent by frequent lapses . The fact that he had at last accepted criticism convinced her that , withTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 135patience and sympathy , he would conquer his weaknesses . The atmosphere in which he now lived was freed from the hectic jealousies that had surrounded him . Even the great Michelangelo set him an example of simplicity in life and speech . " You are happier than I have ever seen you , Nutino , " Lucilla said to him one day . " It is the first time I have ever really known happiness , " he acknowledged . " I am beginning to believe that the world contains peace even for a stormy petrel like me . " Michelangelo was slow in making friends , but in Benvenuto , twenty-five years his junior , he recognized the fire of his own youth , which circumstances had forced him to repress . He returned to the shop not once but often , and discussed with him the technique of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in which he became intensely interested . It was at Michelangelo 's invitation that Benvenuto frequently joined him and other famous artists at Albertinelli 's tavern , at the Porta Vecchia . Albertinelli himself had once been an artist , but , disgusted because the world refused to recognize his work , he abandoned it to become an innkeeper . Frequently he would join his guests at table . " I have now found an Art , " he declared one night , " exactly the opposite of the one I formerlyembraced . This one is without muscle , flesh , or perspective , and  --  what is more to the point  --  without criticism . Your Art imitates flesh and blood , while mine makes them . Those who used to blame me , now drink my good wine and praise me . If there is one of you who does not envy me , he should remember my words , and the next time the critics massacre his handiwork , let him come here and find solace in my philosophy ! " Pompeo also frequented Albertinelli 's tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Approaching Cellinias he sat with Michelangelo , Pompeo greeted him inso-136 DAGGER AND JEWELSlently . " Your God seems still to be with you , " he exclaimed . " Perhaps they were not yet ready for a new face in hell ! " " When they are , Pompeo , " Cellini replied , restraining himself with difficulty , " it will be your face they will welcome , not mine . " " I am returning soon to Rome to complete your morse , " Pompeo baited him . " I can correct your errors , and perhaps produce a creditable piece after all . " " The sooner you go the better , " was the retort . " I have lost interest in Rome , and shall continue here . " Pompeo leaned forward and spoke in a lower voice . " You may soon find it as uncomfortable here as in the Castle of Sant ' Angelo . Remember my words while you are receiving the fair Lucilla 's caresses . " Benvenuto put his hand to his sword , but Michelangelo restrainedhim , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who is that disagreeable varlet ? " the master demanded . " He calls himself Pompeo , " Cellini answered . " He wasformerly my rival in Pope Clement 's Court . " When he repeated the whispered warning , Michelangelo scowled . " This confirms the rumors that have come to us , " he said gloomily . " I should have let you kill him , Benvenuto . That fellow is the Pope 's spy ! " Chapter x V I I I MICHELANGELO 'S words conveyed no message to Benvenutobeyond the fact that the master heartily disapproved of Pompeo , but they aroused his curiosity . " The Pope 's spy ? " Why should his Holiness require a spy in Florence ? He relatedthis adventure to the Del Moros , but Raffaello saw no significance , and Lucilla accepted Pompeo 's attitude as an acknowledgment of the final break between them . Piero Landi was more concerned . " Can it mean that Clement is planning to turn against the city of his birth because his House has been shorn of its power ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days went tranquilly on , the episode was forgotten . Raffaello was satisfied that at last affairs between Lucilla and Benvenuto were progressing as they should , and was well content . Piero Landi discovered that the girl meant much more to his friend than Benvenuto admitted , and he included her fully in his affection . " Have you not noticed a great change in Nutino 's nature ? " Lucilla asked him one day . " I have , " he admitted ; " and I give you credit for it . But do not be deceived . Beneath Nutino 's present calmness the cauldron of his fiery temper still bubbles . So long as he controlsit , I have no fears for him . " " He will control it , " she declared confidently . " The greatesttask has been to make him acknowledge that his temper needs to be controlled . " " You alone have brought him to that realization , " Piero said gratefully . " You yourself have come to understand the value I place upon his friendship . " =37138 DAGGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benvenuto 's commissions increased in number and importance , and his presence in Raffaello 's shop developed it into an establishment . Among other patrons , Michelangelo sent him the charming Federigo Ginori , who had lived some years in Naples . Ginori wished a medal with an Atlas bearing the world upon his shoulders , and he applied to Michelangelo for a design . " Seek out a young goldsmith named Cellini , in the New Market , " Michelangelo advised him . " He will serve you admirably , and stands in no need of sketches by me . However , " he added , noting Ginori 's disappointment , " lest you think I wish to save myself the trouble of making a design , I will gladly give you one ; but meanwhile speak to Benvenuto , and let him also make a model . He can then execute the better of the two . " Ginori explained Michelangelo 's recommendation to Benvenuto . " The master flatters me by proposing such a competition , " the young man exclaimed , vastly pleased that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , famous as he is in his own Art , he has acknowledged that he is not familiar with mine . I accept the challenge gladly . You and he shall judge the result . " Cellini applied himself eagerly to the preparation of the model . His figure was chiseled on a plate of gold , with Atlas holding the heavens upon his back , made out of a crystal ball engraved with the Zodiac on a field of lapis lazuli . When it was finished , Ginori accompanied him to Michelangelo , who placed his sketch beside the model . " There can be no question as to which is the better , " the master exclaimed as he compared them . " Ginori , you should instruct Benvenuto to proceed with his own design . " " I must say that I agree with you , " Federigo replied . The master laughed genially . " You could not do otherwise , Ginori .

" " Of course I admit it , " he answered frankly . " How I wish I could make you understand ! What you and others have found boastful and arrogant in my statements has given me no satisfaction . Rather is it the quality of my work from which I gain my pleasure . When it is good , my nature is to speak of it as impersonally as I would criticize another artist 's effort . When others praise work of mine that I know to be mediocre , I am humiliated . When the great Michelangelo recognizes my genius , then am I gratified , for the appreciation comes from one who knows .

" Let these days go on as a prelude to the great happiness in store for both of you when that test has finally been met.

Pompeo 's jibe had not been an idle boast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , even though the people of Florence remained in blissful ignorance . Just as the Sack followed the happiest days Cellini had known in Rome , so now , when Florence had become so attractive a home , affairs were shapingin the near distance to bring humiliation upon the proud and peaceful city . During the period Clement remained a fugitive at Orvieto , the Emperor conceived the idea of putting an end to the state of the Church by restoring the Pope simply to his original rank of Bishop , thus making Rome again the seat of Empire . When he found the whole Catholic world in opposition to this intention , Charles yielded , in the Treaty of Amiens , to the insistence of a combined France and England , and restored the Papacy to the outward respect of Europe . Thus , on the surface , Clement emerged from the long struggle which culminated in the Sack of Rome the only survivorof the five great powers in whose hands the independence of Italy had previously rested : Venice was cruelly wounded and humiliated ; Naples was made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotent Sforza ; and Florencewas delivered , body and soul , to the Pope , to do with as he liked . Prostrate Italy could no longer resist the secular supremacyof Rome while guaranteed by the power of Spain . The price Clement paid for his apparent success was anotherstory  --  six hundred thousand golden crowns for his liberty and rehabilitation , subservience to the Emperor in exercisingthe Papal power . The Spanish monarch was quite content that Clement should wear the mantle of Saint Peter so long as he himself possessed the power . He took what he wished , and permitted his junior partner to have the rest . THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 141Echoes of all this began to come through to Florence . Some had it that the Prince of Orange was already on his way to attempt the subjugation of the city . Small groups of men gathered in the streets , and listened to speeches delivered to excite the people , and everywhere there was but a single topic of conversation . At Albertinelli 's tavern Benvenuto learned much of politics and intrigue . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortifications of the city . He listened to the great artist 's explanation of the vital importance of strengtheningthe heights of San Miniato , and sympathized with his disgust over the obstructions Niccolo Capponi , the Gonfaloniere , placed in the way of its accomplishment . Other high officials , in sympathy with Michelangelo 's patriotic measures , now joined their table , and the light conversations of the past were turned into serious discussions in which Albertinelli 's jests found no place . In Benvenuto 's shop all work was stopped , and it became crowded with excited youths from the leading families of Florence , attracted by the reputation the goldsmith had achieved during his exploits in the Sack of Rome . Raffaello was so affected by the commotion that he spent most of his time at home . Benvenuto found himself bewildered . The actionof the Pope in forcing this attack upon the city of his birth seemed monstrous , but the treatment accorded the loyal Michelangelo by the citizens he sought to protect appeared no less despicable . Benvenuto had lost his love for battle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Angelo had vanished in the more refined gratification he found in the return to Art and to his friends . While surrounded in his shop one day by these impetuous youths , a letter was slipped into Benvenuto 's hand by a mysteriousstranger , who as suddenly disappeared . When alone , 142 DAGGER AND JEWELShe opened it , and discovered that it came from Rome . The signature was that of Giacopo della Sciorina , who formerly had been a designer of patterns for the cloth weavers in Florence , but was now the keeper of a ferry boat which plied upon the Tiber between Ponte Sisto and Ponte Sant ' Angelo . A man of some small talent , he had succeeded in becoming acquainted with the Pope , who found amusement in listening to his pleasantries . Being one day engaged in conversation , Giacopo wrote , they touched upon the Sack and the defense of the Castle . This brought Benvenuto to the Pope 's mind , and he spoke of him in highest terms , adding that , if he knew where his goldsmithwas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informedthe Pope that Benvenuto was in Florence , whereupon Clement bade him write and tell him to return to Rome . Benvenuto was greatly disturbed by this letter . Clement had done much more for him than had his own city , and the lack of appreciation shown by Florence for Michelangelo destroyed the glamour of excessive patriotism . The suggestion of returning to the Pope 's service was not so much resented by the distraught youth as was the dangerous manner in which it was presented . Cellini had no ambition to have the decision made for him at the end of a hempen rope ! The reply he sent to Giacopo was evasive , but pointed out in no uncertain terms the dangers of communication , ending with a curt request not to repeat the indiscretion . Yet , Giacopo sent him a second letter , so extravagantly worded that , had it come to the attention of the authorities , Benvenuto would have found himself in serious trouble . Pope Clement now commandedhim to return to Rome , wishing him to complete his work upon the morse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope also referred to their earlier friendship , and his desire to resume these relations now that he had regained his power . THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 143Returning to his lodgings , Benvenuto found his friend awaiting him . " What has happened ? " Piero asked solicitously . " Piero , " he said bluntly , " the Pope commands me to return to Rome and to his service . " " But he is our enemy , Nutino ! How can Florence hold out against this attack unless such as you remain to aid us in our struggle ? " " I do n't know what course to take , " Benvenuto declared in his distress . " As the Pope says truly , I and my family have always been of the Medicean party , and that House has shown us many favors . Again , as I have told you , I am not certain whether it is Rome or Florence that I call my home , so to leave Florence now would not be such base desertion as otherwiseyou might think . More than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must admit that Art flourishes under princely patronage far more than when it strives to express itself under a Republic . I am sorely distressed , but most of all lest I may lose your friendship . " Piero embraced him quietly . " Have no fear of that , my Benvenuto . Your experience in the world has been far greater than my own . You possess a vision which I lack . If you decide that you should place yourself in Rome rather than remain in Florence , go your way quickly , and take with you my enduringlove . " " You are indeed my friend , " he replied gratefully . " I must seek advice from others , but first I wished to make certain that you would not think me disloyal to you if I obeyed the Pope 's command . " Benvenuto took the two letters with him to Raffaello 's house , and showed them . The old man hesitated . " It is not wise that I should give you counsel , my son , for Lucilla and I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of his Holiness , but Rome is our home . While it is good144 DAGGER AND JEWELSto live in strange cities , it is bad to die there . But my problem may not be the same as yours . " " What say you , Lucilla ? " Benvenuto asked , turning to the girl . " Take your problem to Michelangelo , " she counseled . " He has proved himself a loyal friend to Florence and to you . His great heart will understand . " " You are right , " he answered thoughtfully . " As you say , Michelangelo will understand . " That evening Cellini went to Albertinelli 's tavern and took his place at the accustomed table . To his surprise Michelangelodid not appear . " Has the master by chance been sent again to Pisa or Ferrara to inspect the fortifications ? " he inquired of Albertinelli . " You have not heard ? Only this morning our friend , worn out by the long opposition to his plans for defense , quitted Florence , and by now is well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great master , the divine artist , the sublime patriot had deserted Florence ! Here was Michelangelo'sanswer . If such as he , who knew the situation as Benvenutocould never grasp it , could leave Florence with the enemy approaching its walls , why should a Cellini hesitate to obey the Pope 's command ? Benvenuto hastily left the tavern and again sought Piero Landi , but something restrained him from repeatingthe stupendous news . All Florence would know it soon enough . " Piero , " he said with feeling . " I have decided to go to Rome . " " Then I know that you should leave Florence , " his friend answered loyally . " God bless you , Piero , " he cried with more emotion than he had ever felt . " Here are my keys . Return the gems and gold which remain in my shop to those whose names you will find inscribed upon my book . Be assured that I shall neverTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 145bear arms against Florence , which contains the dearest friend I have ever known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . " Have no further concern about your things . Write me when you can , and know always that I shall cherish your friendship . " Embracing him , Benvenuto left without trusting himself to say more . A few moments later he was at Liperata 's house . " Cecchino has gone , " she told him . " He was transferred to the service of Duke Alessandro a week ago , and is now in Rome . " " And I am going , too , my sister . May God watch over you . " From Liperata 's house Benvenuto hastened to the via de ' Bardi , where he found preparations completed for departure . " Lucilla , Michelangelo has given me his counsel . " " He bids you stay ? " " Michelangelo himself has left Florence . " His hearers gazed at him in astonishment . " Then you need hesitate no longer , " the girl said at length , with an expression on her face which showed relief . " We will go on together , " Raffaello said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant that when once in Rome we may again find peace ! " " For you , my father , it should be peace , " Benvenuto exclaimed ; " but what of me ? I have come to love this tranquil life , Lucilla , with you to guard me from myself . I dread the return to the intrigues of the Court . I distrust my strength to maintain my self-control in that maelstrom of jealousy and deceit . " " That will be the test , Nutino , " she told him . " It is time that you and I should learn how strong you are . " 1ook IIIn which a Goldsmith proves himself more stubborn than a PopeChapter X I XPOPE CLEMENT was becoming reconciled to his enforced association with the Emperor , even though never permitted to forget the fact that he was junior partner . Things might have been worse . The details of the co-partnership were arranged by the Treaty of Barcelona , and made secure by the Treaty of Cambray . By this last polite document King Francis sacrificed his Italian allies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquished the last claim to French influence in Italy . Florence alone was resisting , making an unexpectedly heroic and stubborn defense ; but she could not long hold out against the overwhelming numbers of the opposing force so obligingly supplied by the Emperor . The climax of mutual satisfaction came when Charles graciously accepted the ImperialCrown , symbolic of World Empire , from the hands of the complacent Pope . Years before , when Clement , as Cardinal Giulio de ' Medici , ruled Florence , he was known as a gentle , generous prelate , considerate of his people 's welfare ; but during that period an attempt was made upon his life . Then the gentle bleat of the lamb changed into the snarl of a wolf . Up to the time of the Sack of Rome , Clement , as Pope , had exercised his prerogativeswithout vindictiveness ; but after his humiliation the wolf again appeared in his character . He had regained power over all but the Emperor ; he now proceeded to exercise that power , so far as Charles permitted him , to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation of rebellious Florence was nearly accomplished . Now he was determined to restore the glory of his Court at the devastated Palace of the Popes . To accomplish this he needed the prestige of Cellini 's presence. 149150 DAGGER AND JEWELSBenvenuto was ten days in Rome before he announced himself to his master . The companionship in the Castle during the Sack , and the dangers passed through together , had created a bond that could not be lightly set aside . Cellini looked forwardkeenly to their meeting . What conditions would he now find at Court ? Were the Pope 's messages of friendship expressionsof real affection , or merely honeyed baits to secure the goldsmith 's services ? Had his enemies grown as weary of fighting as had he ? Thoughts such as these ran through his mind as he presentedhimself at Clement 's levee . The first personage he encounteredthere was Cardinal Salviati , and the malevolent scowl that greeted him answered one of his questions . He felt the old-time fury of his temper surge within him . " It is no use , " he muttered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight fire only with fire . " The gracious words with which he planned to convey to the Pope his own pleasure in the reunion remained unspoken as he knelt to kiss his ring , and Clement noticed his defensive attitude . " So you have deigned to return , Benvenuto . I am glad to have you back , yet it was necessary to summon you a second time . " This rebuke added to the sting of Salviati 's scowl . " An artist like Cellini , " he replied stiffly , " may perhaps have affairs of his own as important as a Pope 's . But I am here , in obedience to the command of your Holiness . " Clement started to reprove him for his presumption , but changed his mind . " I see that neither the passing of time nor the rigors of war have quenched the fire in your nature , Benvenuto . I trust that your skill with the chisel is no less im-paired . " " I am as you have always known me , your Holiness . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 151Cardinal Salviati ; when you send for me I assume that you seek the truth . " Salviati cast a vindictive look upon the impudent goldsmith , which Cellini as steadfastly returned . The fierce glances exchangedbetween the two explained to the Pope the occasion for Benvenuto 's antagonistic attitude , and he smiled grimly . " It is well for you , Salviati , " he chaffed the Cardinal , " that there is no barrel of stone here as there was at the Castle , or Benvenuto would surely hurl it at you for your ill-natured greeting . We counsel forgetfulness . That affair was but an accident . " " This ill-mannered rascal did his best to contrive my death , " Salviati grumbled . " The most holy Father will tell you that what I aim at , I hit , " was Benvenuto 's hot retort . " Cellini is right , " Clement confirmed , enjoying the encounter . " Not once while we were together in the Castle did he miss the object at which he aimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dismissed the others from his presence , the Pope made a sign for Benvenuto to draw nearer . " You have made me aware that you are here , " he remarked , as the artist again kissed his ring . " I should rightly be offended , but , when not directed against myself , your fiery temper and your dauntless courage entertain me . Had both been mine , perhaps I should have issued with more credit from my recent clash with Charles . " " I have no doubt of that , your Holiness , " Cellini agreed with him completely . " Each one of us forms in his own heart the image of the Deity he serves . Mine is the God who helps those most who help themselves . " " Eh ! What 's that ? You mean ?  --  but I did not summon you to Rome to teach me theology ! " Clement changed his152 DAGGER AND JEWELScourse quickly . " Now what of my rebellious Florentines ? Are they near the end of their resistance ? " " That your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informers , than I could tell him . BenvenutoCellini returned to Rome as goldsmith , not as spy . " Clement regarded him critically through half-closed eyes . " Of course , " he answered ; " but even the great Michelangelo seemed discouraged enough to seek a milder climate . " " He will return , your Holiness , " Benvenuto declared firmly , challenging the slur upon his friend 's patriotism . " He has returned , " the Pope announced with a show of resentment . Cellini 's face lighted at the unexpected news . " Then I will give your Holiness advice more valuable than any you have received from spies . With Michelangelo again in Florence , prepare yourself for a longer siege . " " Even as I did not summon you to instruct me in theology , so is it best not to continue our talk of politics , " the Pope remarked . " My morse remains unfinished . I wish the coinage of my realm completed . I command you to continue what you have begun . " " Now you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved . " Give me back the unfinished plate and the jewels which we protected in the Castle , and you shall have your morse . " Clement 's face assumed a cunning the artist had not seen before . " You shall have the unfinished plate , Benvenuto , but for the present I will preserve the jewels in my own keeping .  --  Where are you established ? " " Again in the shop of Raffaello del Moro . " " A worthy man , and a clever goldsmith , " the Pope commented . " His influence should produce more of an effect upon your unbridled temper . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 153 " Fighting runs in the Cellini blood , your Holiness . My ancestor  --  " " I remember , " Clement interrupted quickly , not caring to hear the story again . " He was one of Julius Caesar 's most valiant captains . " " He was , your Holiness ; and my brother Cecchino is even now in the service of Prince Alessandro . " " Well , well ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not let Cecchino do the fighting for the family , while you devote yourself to my commissions ? " " I doubt if he could serve me in the Palace , most holy Father . With Salviati here , and with Traiano and Pompeo again in your service , I shall continue to wear my poniard and my coat of mail .  --  Unless , " he added , " your Holiness will protect me from the jealousies of my rivals . " " Since when has Cellini required protection from his enemies ? " Clement laughed . " What of that God of whom you just boasted , who protects those who protect themselves ? " " I and my God can defend me from violence , your Holiness , but not against lying tongues which undermine a master'sconfidence . " " Complete for me that morse you have so well begun , and you need have no fear of lying tongues . " Benvenuto left the Pope 's presence with an undefined spirit of unrest . This was not the Clement he had known . Outwardlythe reception had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pope had not rebuked him when he lashed Salviati , and had even acknowledged an admiration for his courage . Yet , underneath , he recognized an unpleasant change in Clement 's nature . Raffaello had partially restored his former shop and house in the Banchi , and Benvenuto looked upon it more as his home than the new lodgings he secured . To the responsibility154 DAGGER AND JEWELSshe had always assumed of her father , Lucilla now added a sense of protection over him . She recognized that his apprehensionswere well founded , and was eager to do her part in helping him to hold the grip over himself he had worked so hard to gain . Piero had warned her that Benvenuto 's temper was only sleeping , and she knew that the test they both awaited could not long be postponed . When this came , he would need all the strength that she could give him . When Cellini returned to the shop he found Lucilla sitting beside her father . " It is no use , " he declared bluntly , repeatingthe words he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than before , and for one of my nature there is nothing ahead but trouble . " Lucilla placed her hand on his arm sympathetically . " You are stronger now , Nutino . You are better able to meet it . " Then he told them of the change he felt in Clement . " There is something sinister , even when he speaks friendly words , " Benvenuto declared . " I ca n't explain it , but I feel it . " " His Holiness must have changed , " Raffaello agreed , " or he could never have disclosed such vengeful feelings toward Florence . There is no doubt that your path is beset with danger , my son . Your safety lies in making yourself indis-pensable . " " I must do more than that , " Benvenuto declared , " and Lucilla must absolve me from responsibility . Were Ito knuckle under to his Holiness , like those lackeys who fawn upon him and lick his hand , there would be no chance of coming through unscathed . Clement is still as timid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courage by assuming the role of bully . He has come to expect me to be insolent , and , while he resents it , he respects me . How can I conduct myself as bravo while in the presence of the Pope , Lucilla , and act the courtier when with you ? It is too much to ask . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 155 " I expect no more than you can give , Nutino , " she answered quietly . " My father is an old man , who can help you only with his advice . I am but a woman , and can help you only with my devotion . The charting of your course lies wholly with yourself . " " Our hearts seek only your advantage , my son , " Raffaello added . Benvenuto remained silent for what seemed a long time to his anxious friends , who realized the crisis he was facing . Then he held out his hand to Lucilla . " Is your devotion such as to give me the strength a husband receives only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extended hand . " My devotionis such that it will perform an act even more selfsacrificingby refusing . The test is still ahead , my Nutino . You have yet to learn whether you set a greater value upon my love than upon yourself . " " My only comfort is my Art , " he replied with a touch of bitterness , while the glistening tears in Lucilla 's eyes brought pain to the old man 's heart . When Benvenuto again held the unfinished morse in his hand he forgot everything else . The beauty of the design was greater than he remembered , the masterly execution filled him with satisfaction . Deprived of his former companionship with Gian Francesco and Madonna Porzia , and for the moment resentfulof Lucilla 's attitude , he devoted himself feverishly to the work which had so long been interrupted . One outlet Benvenuto found was his association with Cecchino . His brother 's presence in Rome gave him opportunity to renew family ties which had been denied him . There was little in common between the two , yet the musketeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecchino knew nothing of his brother 's Art , but gave him156 DAGGER AND JEWELSa dog-like devotion which won a corresponding affection in return . By an unhappy chance it was through Cecchino rather than his enemies that Benvenuto became involved in the misfortuneshe dreaded . Bertino Aldobrandi , a friend of Cecchino 's , was killed one day in an attempt to rescue a prisoner from the Bargello 's guard . The Cellini temper also ran in Cecchino 's blood , and when he learned of this calamity he sought out the musketeer who had delivered the fatal blow , and coolly ran him through with his sword . When the other members of the guard took him to task for his violence , he again drew his sword and attacked them all . Cecchino 's daring so caught them by surprise that others would have been injuredhad not an arquebusier fired his piece . The commotion drew Benvenuto to the spot , ignorant of the fact that his brother was the chief actor . The wounded ' Cecchino , lying in the street , recognized him first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror-stricken , dropped on his knees beside him . " Get me away from this gaping crowd , " he begged . " I am dying , Nutino , but do n't grieve for me . A violent death is a soldier 's proper end . " Benvenuto helped to convey him to a house near by , and gradually learned the whole story . " I could do no less , " Cecchino explained . " It was the honor of Alessandro 's companyagainst the Bargello 's guard . Except for the ball from that accursed arquebus I should have routed them all . Tell the Prince how well I served him . " " Die in peace , " Benvenuto reassured him , his voice broken by emotion . " I promise that I will avenge you with my own hand . " The goldsmith returned to his bench with a heavy heart . Raffaello and Lucilla tried to comfort him , but he became more and more despondent . For days the work upon theTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 157morse was at a standstill , while Benvenuto sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bemoaning his brother 's loss . " I can see Cecchino 's face always before me , " he exclaimed to Lucilla . " He blames me for not keeping my promise . " " Would that bring him back , Nutino ? " " It would add to the repose of his soul , " he answered . Clement was sympathetic , but felt more concerned over the delay caused to the work on the morse . " Have you not learned that there is no remedy against death ? You are making yourself sick from grief . One might think you were planning to follow Cecchino . " " My fury is a sort of fever , " Benvenuto explained , pressing his hot forehead with his hand . " It has lasted for days , preventingme from taking food or sleeping , making my blood boil in my veins , and affecting my eyes . It will never suffer me to rest until I have avenged Cecchino . " " There has been fighting enough , " the Pope said sternly . " The more you devote yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengefulness . " Cellini left the Palace with every intention of following the counsel of the Pope . He spent hours upon the morse and on the dies for the new coinage , but accomplished nothing . Had the musketeer who shot his brother been his mistress , he could not have watched him more closely . The admonitions of the Pope and the gentle sympathy of Lucilla might have conqueredthe fury that consumed him had not the musketeer rashly boasted of his deed . " I showed Cecchino that the Bargello 's guard are better fighters than Alessandro 's company , " he declared proudly . This was the spark that fanned the smouldering embers of Benvenuto 's temper into insane frenzy . When these words were repeated to him , he flung his chisel to the floor , and , in spite of Lucilla 's desperate efforts to restrain him , rushed madly from the shop. 158 DAGGER AND JEWELSHe discovered his enemy standing complacently in the doorway of his house , sword in hand , having just risen from supper . With the cry of a tortured soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke with a large Pistojan dagger . The wounded man dropped his sword , and , half-stunned with pain , took to flight ; but Benvenuto quickly caught up with him , and , again lifting his dagger , drove it to the hilt into the man 's back . Leaving his victim where he fell , Cellini rushed frantically to Alessandro 's palace , which lay between the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon . " Cecchino is avenged ! " he announced exultantly to the Prince , as he dropped on one knee . " That is a deed well done , " Alessandro declared , raising Benvenuto to his feet . " I wish I had taken it on myself . Have no anxiety . For a while , stay within my palace , and continue here the work upon the morse on which Clement has so set his heart . This affair will soon be forgotten ; but some kinsman of the musketeer may serve you ill , and that I would prevent . " During these days Cellini received no message from the Pope , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamberlain called at Alessandro 's palace , and explained that the Pope knew all , and , while displeased , was still well inclined . Later the chamberlain conducted Benvenuto to Clement 's presence , who glowered so ominously upon his goldsmith that the culprit trembled . To conceal his agitation , Cellini uncovered the plate of gold , upon which his work was now well advanced . As soon as Clement 's eye fell upon the morse he forgot his resentment , and his friendliness returned . " The work is well done , " he said , " and , under all the circumstances , your progress deserves praise . But I resent this mad yielding to your fury , which interferes with my pleasure . Now that you are cured , keep guard over your passions . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 159 " With my debt paid to Cecchino , " the artist answered soberly , " I can complete this masterpiece to the glory of your Holiness . I am ready now to receive the jewels . " Benvenuto was grateful for the Pope 's forbearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement had warned him against this act , and Clement expected his admonitions to be accepted as commands . Life was held too cheaply by the State to warrant interference except in the interest of some powerful influence . As Alessandro had said , danger of reprisal came from some friend or kinsman of the victim rather than from the law . Benvenuto had made of himself accuser , judge , and executioner . It was his business to defend himself against retaliation , but his confidence in himself quieted all anxiety . It was the Pope 's anger he had feared  --  not because of the murder , but because this final yielding to his frenzy had interfered with the progress of the morse . But it was the effect upon Lucilla that Benvenuto should most have dreaded . When he returned to the shop , she and Raffaello were together . As soon as the girl saw him she burst into tears , and covered her face with her hands . " Why do you weep , Lucilla ? " Benvenuto asked , surprised . " Everything is all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinstated in his good will . " Raffaello held up a restraining hand . " She is over-wrought , my son . She does not understand . " The girl dried her eyes and fixed a dull gaze on him . " You have killed a man , " she said slowly , as if each word caused her pain . " You come here with blood upon your hands ! Oh , Nutino , how could you so defile yourself ! " The old man placed his arm around her . " Think no more about it , my daughter . This is a man 's affair . Benvenuto has only punished a miscreant for the evil he did his brother . If his Holiness sees no wrong , who are you to condemn him ? " 16o DAGGER AND JEWELS " I am a woman , " she answered , " and as a woman I say that to yield thus to passion is an evidence of weakness . I care not what others may think , no matter how high their station , but to Benvenuto I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now that his fury was abated , Cellini saw the affair in clearer light . " Lucilla is right , Raffaello , " he said with genuinerepentance . " However you or I may justify my act , whateverclemency the Pope may extend , the deed was cowardly , and I stand ashamed . " The girl 's manner changed at his unexpected attitude . " By those words you restore my confidence , " she said more hopefully . " May this be a lesson to you , Nutino . While you hold yourself in control , I ask no more satisfying companion ; but when the demon of your temper possesses you , then you are a veritable devil ! " " I need your help , " he whispered . " Ca n't you see how much I need you ? " To his disappointment , she made no reply . Chapter XXCLEMENT was surprised to find the work on his morse so far advanced , and could only conclude that the passion in Benvenuto 's blood which proved fatal to the musketeer had served as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassing beauty the piece assumed as it approached completionmade the Pope eager to possess it , and he hesitated no longer to turn over the precious stones required by the design  --  all except the great diamond , which had been pawned to raise funds toward the ransom demanded by the Emperor Charles . Clement openly expressed to members of his Court the satisfaction he felt in his favorite 's work , and Cellini 's enemies redoubled their efforts to effect his downfall . Pompeo 's hatred had reached the point of desperation . The jealousy that began with the contest for the Pope 's morse was fanned by his rival 's continuing triumphs , and reached its climax when he found himself supplanted in Lucilla 's favor . Benvenuto had emerged from the perils of the Sack with added laurels ; he had escaped the attack on Florence ; he had murdered a musketeer  --  yet his star not only remained constant but was glowing with increasing brilliancy . When the news was noised about the Court that the Pope had delivered his priceless jewels to Cellini , Pompeo saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he promised him a large reward if he succeeded in breaking into Benvenuto 's home and making off with the valuables . The artist 's householdat that time consisted of five journeymen , who lived with him , and a handsome dog which Alessandro had presentedhim as a token of friendship. 161162 DAGGER AND JEWELSWith the plans matured , the thief entered the house at night , and , after picking up some unimportant things in gold and silver , started to burst open the strong-box in which the jewels were kept . The dog alone was aroused . While the journeymenslept , this sole defender of his master 's honor attacked the intruder so viciously that he was glad to escape with the few pieces he had secured . After sunrise the workmen came downstairs to the living-room , and , when they saw that the house had been broken into and the boxes smashed , they began to wail , " Alas ! alas ! We have been robbed ! " The clamor awoke Cellini , and he rushed down in a panic .

At last he ordered one of the assistants to open it , and report how many gems were missing . The journeymen gathered around , breathless with excitement .

" Your own piece and all the stones are here ; but that accursed thief has left us naked to the shirt ! Last night , because of the burning heat , we took our clothes off downstairs , and the wretch has stolen them . " Cellini 's reaction was so great that he laughed hysterically . " A plague upon your clothes ! " he cried . " Send out and get yourselves new outfits . I will gladly pay for them .

" What better blind , your Holiness , to cloak his knavery than this reported robbery ? Until now he has had no opportunity . " While they were discussing the affair , Cellini was announced . In spite of the Pope 's disclaimers , Francesco 's suspicionshad shaken his confidence . As Benvenuto knelt , Clement glared at him ominously , and cried with unnecessary heat , " Why do you come here ? What has happened ? " " There has been a robbery at my shop , your Holiness . " " What did I tell you ? " Francesco interrupted . " What did Francesco tell your Holiness ? " Cellini asked . As the Pope hesitated , Francesco himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a cloak to cover up your unworthiness . " Benvenuto regarded Del Nero with a look which should have annihilated him .

" Francesco left the room with scant ceremony . The Pope was embarrassed by the sudden turn the affair had taken , but tried to make amends . " I assure you , Benvenuto , Francesco 's unworthy suspicions made no impression on me . I trust you beyond any man in my service . " Cellini bowed coldly . " Your faith is well placed , your Holiness , as you have had opportunity to discover . " " To prove my confidence , " Clement said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just recovered from my Genoese bankers . " 164 DAGGER AND JEWELSAt last , after these heavy tribulations , the morse was finished , and Cellini called Lucilla and Raffaello to examine it before he took it to the Pope . " This represents the Benvenuto I love , " the girl exclaimed admiringly . " The purity of the precious metal shows the integrity of my friend ; the graceful designs form enduring messages in a language I understand ; and the brilliant flashes of the gems are beacons to guide others to the shrine of beauty . " " It is the greatest masterpiece ever fashioned in Rome , " Raffaello declared . The artist flushed with pleasure . " There is but one other whose praise I crave , " he said . " I wish that I might show it to Michelangelo . " " Have you not heard the news ? " Raffaello asked . " Florencehas at last fallen .

" Cellini unwrapped the package , and placed the piece in a favorable position . The Pope looked at it for several moments in admiring silence ; then , as he turned toward the artist , a smile of satisfaction spread over his face . " Have I translated my boasting into facts , your Holiness ? " the artist demanded . " You have exceeded every promise ! " Clement cried with enthusiasm . " Were I a wealthy emperor I would give my Benvenuto as much land as his eyes could survey .

" There is a reward your Holiness can give me that will be far more acceptable than land or bread , " he said . " Is there another post vacant ? " Clement asked , suspicious , from previous experience , of his favorite 's ideas of recompense . " In Florence there is a great artist , your Holiness , against whom you have proclaimed the penalty of death . " Clement 's face darkened . " Michelangelo was a member of the Nine , " he declared fiercely . " He delayed our success by fortifying the hill and arming the bell tower of San Miniato . He dared to propose the razing of the Palace of the Medici , and to name the square on which it stood the Place of Mules . " " Can you believe that last idle rumor , your Holiness ? As a youth Michelangelo was a guest in that very Palace at the table of your uncle , Lorenzo the Magnificent , who appreciated and encouraged his great talents . " " The more reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope said sternly . " He has for the present escaped us . When we recover him , he shall pay the penalty . " " There is a finer penalty than death for Michelangelo , " Cellini pleaded . " I challenge you to suggest one that will give me greater satisfaction . " " Condemn him to complete those monuments of the Medici , your Holiness , which still remain unfinished . I saw them while in Florence . They are magnificent . Such a sentence will add eternal luster to the glory of your reign . " The frown disappeared from Clement 's face . " Before God , Benvenuto , you should be Pope instead of me ! Those unfinishedmonuments would haunt me in his death . I will at once announce my decision , and the monuments of the166 DAGGER AND JEWELSMedici shall be completed .  --  And now , what do you ask for yourself ? " " I think of nothing that is really worth while beyond what you have already granted , " Cellini answered , gratified that he had paid his debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mace-bearer 's place which happens to be vacant . It is scarcely worthy of the creator of your morse , but perhaps your Holiness will wish to bestow this small token on me by way of earnest until you yourself can think of something better . " " Why should I think at all while you are with me ? " Clement laughed good-naturedly . " It was you who read in my mind my desire to appoint you Stamp Master in the Mint . You show me how at last to control the restless genius of Michelangelo . Now you again discover a trifling gift for yourself which even I had overlooked ! It is yours , Benvenuto ; but I shall not let you serve as Mace-bearer , for I can not spare you from my service . You are welcome to the two hundred crowns a year it carries . " " You are a true patron of the Arts , your Holiness , " he exclaimed gratefully as he kissed the Pope 's ring . " With the great Michelangelo serving you in Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , your reign will rival that of your cousin Leo 's . " Clement nodded approvingly . " I must think of some new commission greater even than my morse , " he replied complacently  --  " something that will prove a task even for your consummate skill . " " If you succeed , " Benvenuto cried in excellent spirits , " it will prove to the world that you are a greater Pope than I am goldsmith . " Chapter XXITHE MORSE was finished , and , in the reflected happiness of his patron 's full approval , Cellini forgot his apprehensions that the nature of the Pope had changed . He was glad of the respite that came while Clement was seeking to decide upon that new commission which was to test his goldsmith 's genius . Benvenuto laughed that so droll a thought should come into his gracious patron 's mind , and jested about it with Lucilla and Raffaello while he applied himself to the work upon the models for the new coinage , and other commissions of lesser importance . But while Cellini relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of the gloved hand of iron that rested heavily upon him , and guided events he had previously controlled to conclusions at variance with his own desires . Charles had made good his promise to reduce Florence and restore the rule of the Medici ; but when the Pope proposed that Duke Alessandro assume his rank through hereditary right , the Emperor subtly reminded his junior partner of his subordinate position by insisting that the appointment be confirmed by his own Imperial patent . Clement had no conscientiousscruples against annulling the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon ; but Charles quietly issued instructions to the contrary , and Rome incurred the deadly enmity of England . What touched the Pope even more closely was that , because of the enormous indemnity the Emperor levied upon him , he found himself for the first time in his life embarrassed for gold with which to pay the expenses of his establishment . To redeem from the Genoese bankers the great diamond for the center of his gorgeous morse had so strained167168 DAGGER AND JEWELShis financial resources that the coffers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a situation that might easily try the patience of a stouter heart than Clement 's , and cause trivial annoyances to assume undue proportions . Cellini discovered this unexpectedly when Clement finally summoned him to the Palace , and confided to him his inspired idea for the new commission . " Benvenuto , " his Holiness exclaimed , " just as you have already fashioned for me the richest and most beautiful morse in all Christendom , I now command you to devise and execute a chalice that shall surpass anything previously conceived in the world . " " That is a stupendous order , your Holiness , " Benvenuto replied with sparkling eyes ; " but do you really mean that it shall exceed in richness those chalices that other artists have executed for lesser patrons ? The vision of your chalice , most holy Father , as it first comes to me , dazzles even my own mentality , accustomed as it is to magnificent conceptions . But the cost of such a masterpiece , your Holiness ! I had thought  --  " " It is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruptedimperiously . " Since when have I placed a limit in expense on anything I want ? " Cellini bowed low and kissed his ring . " No artist ever served a more munificent prince , " he declared ; but in his heart he felt misgivings . All Rome knew that the Pope was nearly bankrupt , yet no Maecenas could have bestowed a commission with less apparent concern for cost . " The gold will be exhausted before I am fairly started , " Benvenuto confided his doubts to Raffaello . " Then his Holinesswill hold me responsible for the delay . " The old man tried to reassure him . " You can not decline the commission , " he said . " Perhaps the Pope has resources of which we are ignorant . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 169Disregarding his apprehensions , Cellini went to work upon his model , which he made of wood and wax . On the knop , halfway up the stem , which the celebrant grasps in his hand , he modeled small figures representing Faith , Hope , and Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the base of the cup , in circles , were three medallions in bas-relief . One showed the Nativity of Christ ; the second , the Resurrection ; and the third , Saint Peter crucifiedhead downwards . When he exhibited this work to Clement , the Pontiff was delighted . " There are great possibilities in your design . If the chalice surpasses its beginnings as much as the morse was more beautiful than your first model , we shall have something the world will envy us . " " This will require much gold , " Benvenuto remarked . " Is that your affair or mine ? " the Pope stormed . " If you will devote as much time to the work itself as to pestering me for gold and recompenses , your labor will show greater results . " " Your pardon , most holy Father , " Benvenuto answered . " I wrongly thought the material necessary to my accomplish-ment . " " When I refuse it to you will be time enough to complain . " For several weeks the artist applied himself sullenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the chalice to the Palace for inspection , and , as it advanced , Clement expressed his full approval . For the time , there was enough gold in hand , but as yet no payment had been made for labor , and Benvenuto began to feel the need of money . Learning that a post in the Piombo , where leaden seals were affixed to Bulls and instruments of State , was vacant , and remembering the Pope 's complacency on two previous occasions , the artist ventured to ask for it . " I would not speak of it , your Holiness , except that you yourself did not think the post of Mace-bearer wholly worthy the creator of your morse . " 170 DAGGER AND JEWELSThe request did not find Clement in an amiable mood . A disagreeable expression came into his face . " This time you do not read my mind as truly as before , " he replied . " That post in the Piombo is worth eight hundred crowns a year . If you had it , you would spend your time twirling your thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benvenuto was furious at this unexpected rebuff . To be deniedthe post was enough without the unjust suggestion that he would waste his time . " Cats of a good breed make better mousers when they are fat than when starving , " he retorted , with difficulty holding himself in restraint ; " and likewise honest men , who profess some talent , exercise it to far nobler purpose when they have the wherewithal to live abundantly . Princes who provide artists with support are watering the roots of genius , for talent at its birth comes into the world lean and scabby . " " I have done much for you , Cellini , " the Pope replied ; " perhaps too much , for it makes you overbearing . " This was more than the artist could bear , and he flung discretionto the winds . " Do not think for a moment , your Holiness , that I asked for the position with any expectation of getting it , " he cried in anger . " I am only too happy to have this exalted post of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I built but castles in the air . Follow the example of Pope Giulio 's illustrious memory , your Holiness , who conferred this office in the Piombo upon Bramante , that much discredited architect . You can easily find artists of the same breed in your own Court . " Making a stiff bow , he stalked out of the room . Clement , incensedby his favorite 's conduct , exclaimed to the Bishop of Vasona , " That devil , Benvenuto , will not brook rebuke . I was inclined to give him the post he asked for , but now I will show him that he can not be so insulting to a Pope . " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 171 " Most blessed Father , " the Bishop answered , " Benvenuto is still young , and a sword becomes him better than a friar 's frock . Some time you will be able to bestow on him something more suitable . " Clement summoned Bartolommeo Valori , his chamberlain . " Go and find Cellini , " he comrnanded . " Tell him from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piombo for Bastiano the painter ; but add that he may count on having the next important place that is vacant , provided he improves in his behavior and finishes my commissions . " Bartolommeo overtook Benvenuto at the corner of the Mint , and repeated the message . The artist was still enraged . " Tell his Holiness that I shall devote myself to his work with greater application than ever , but with no expectation of proper recompense . " Bartolommeo reproved him . " This is not the way to receive the advances of a Pope . " " I should be mad , " he retorted , " if I based my hopes on such promises , being certain they would not be kept . " The Pope 's indignation was increased by Cellini 's imprudent reply . Had he followed his first hasty impulses , he would have dismissed him from the Court ; but this he could not bring himself to do . He wished to discipline his unruly goldsmith for insubordination , but at the same time dared take no chance of losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of leaving Rome to meet the Emperor at Bologna afforded Clement an easy opportunity to shift the burden . When he set out upon his journey , he turned over to Cardinal Salviati , whom he left behind as Legate of Rome , the responsibility of following up the work on the chalice . " Benvenuto esteems his own great talents more than he does his Pope , " he told the Legate . " Keep him busy , so that I may find the chalice well advanced on my return . " 172 DAGGER AND JEWELSIt was unfortunate for Benvenuto that his affairs should have fallen into the hands of one already so deeply prejudiced against him , particularly at a time when the supply of gold was exhausted . A few days after the Pope 's departure , the Cardinalcommanded him to bring the chalice to the Palace . Cellini obeyed the summons , but empty-handed . " Where is that onion stew of yours ? " Salviati demanded in an ugly tone . " Have you finished it ? " " Most reverend Monsignor , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor can I complete it until I am given onions with which to concoct it . " Salviati 's wrath was increased by Benvenuto 's cool assurance . " I will send you to the galleys , " he cried . " Then perhaps you will have the grace to go on with your work . " " Send me to the galleys , Monsignor , when I have done deeds worthy of them , " the artist retorted ; " but for my presentmisdemeanors , I snap my fingers at your galleys . What is more , because of your insulting manner , I would not set my hand to the chalice even if I had the material . Do n't send for me again , your Worship , for I will not come  --  not even if summoned by the Bargello ! " Salviati dared go no farther , but his annihilating looks followed the departing Cellini . From time to time he sent messengersto inquire regarding the progress on the chalice , and Benvenuto always sent back the same message , " Say to Monsignorthat he must supply me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Salviati did not fail to keep the Pope informed of the continuedinsubordination of his favorite . When Clement returned to Rome he sent for the offending artist , commanding him to bring the chalice with him . Upon Cellini 's arrival in the Presence , Clement said sharply , " Show me your work . Is it finished ? " THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 173Benvenuto displayed it , and the Pope discovered that it was no farther advanced than when he had last seen it . " In God 's truth , " he cried angrily , " you hold no man in respect . Were it riot for decency and order I would have you and your chalice thrown out of the window ! " " That would be preferable to what I have already endured , " he replied . " Immediately after your Holiness ' departure , CardinalSalviati sent for me , and when I presented myself he called my chalice a stew of onions , and told me he would send me to complete it in the galleys . " As Cellini left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who happened to be present . " Salviati is a beast , " he exclaimed petulantly . " I did not tell him to go so brutally about this business . This young man 's audacity angers me , but if he has been unjustly treated of course I must make allowance for it . " " Most blessed Father , " his companion replied drily , " permit me to put a question . I have seen you yield to the hottest anger I have ever observed , and then to the warmest compassion . I beg your Holiness to tell me who this young man is . " " You do n't know him ? " Clement asked in surprise . " He is Benvenuto Cellini , the greatest goldsmith ever born . You saw the chalice  --  is it not magnificent , even in its unfinished state ? " " I have never beheld a more splendid piece of work , " the noble answered . The Pope was gratified by the admiration expressed by his companion . " In my heart , " he admitted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bridle Benvenuto 's high temper , and continue him in my service . " Cardinal Salviati was later appointed Legate to Parma . Even at that distance from Rome he could not forget his hostility to Cellini , or his resentment against the young artist 's uncon-174 DAGGER AND JEWELScealed contempt for him . In Parma , a Milanese goldsmith , named Tobbia , had been arrested for false coining , and condemned to the gallows . Because of this man 's great ability in his craft , representations were made to the Cardinal in his favor . Seeing in this criminal a weapon to turn against Benvenuto , Salviati suspended the execution of the sentence . " If you send for this great genius to come to Rome , " Salviati wrote to Clement , " your Holiness will bring down the overweaning arrogance of Cellini , and I am quite certain that Tobbia 's work will please you far more than his . " The Pope , always ready to welcome a really good artist , accepted Salviati 's statement , and summoned Tobbia to Rome . Upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear before him , and commissioned each to furnish a design for mounting a magnificent unicorn 's horn , which had lately been purchased for seventeen thousand ducats as a wedding gift to Catherine de ' Medici , on her marriage to Prince Henry , Duke of Orleans . When the rivals again appeared before Clement , they submittedtheir drawings . Tobbia 's was in the form of a candlestick , the horn being stuck in it like a candle , and at the base he had introduced four small heads of unicorns . When Benvenuto saw the design he smiled . The Pope noticed his amusement and cried , " You who are so satisfied with yourself , show me your sketch . " Cellini made no answer , but unfolded his paper . His design was a single unicorn 's head , proportioned in size to the horn , taken partly from the horse and partly from the stag , and enrichedwith fantastic mane and other ornaments . An involuntaryexclamation of admiration went up from all the company , and no one could doubt that the unprejudiced decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition were some MilaneseTHE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 175gentlemen of high rank , to whom Salviati had entrusted the responsibility of making certain that his trick succeeded . " Most blessed Father , " one of these nobles exclaimed , " your Holiness is sending this magnificent present into France . Please reflect that the French are people of less culture than ourselves , and will not understand the excellence of Cellini 's work . Pyxes like this one of Tobbia 's will better suit their taste , and these , too , can be finished in shorter time . Benvenuto can devote himself to completing your chalice , and you will thus get two pieces done in the same time as one . " The Pope was influenced by their suggestion . Salviati 's idea of using this new goldsmith to temper Benvenuto 's confidence in himself might be worth trying , for his favorite was getting out of hand and needed discipline . " You may be right , gentlemen , " his Holiness yielded ; and next day he commissioned Tobbia to mount the unicorn 's horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct Cellini to confine his work to the chalice . Benvenuto made no attempt to conceal his resentment . " Tell your master that my one desire is to complete this beautifulpiece I have begun , and be done with it , " he answered . " If the material had been anything but gold , I could have supplied it myself . Being gold , his Holiness must furnish me with additional metal if he wishes me to get on with my work . " " Zounds ! " exclaimed the messenger . " Do n't ask the Pope for gold unless you mean to drive him into such a fury as will ruin you . Gold is a scarce commodity at the Palace ! " Benvenuto remained firm . " Will your Lordship please tell me , " he inquired , " how one can make bread without flour ? Even that would be easier than to complete this chalice withoutgold . Say to his Holiness that I will not add a single stroke until I am supplied with the material I require . " 176 DAGGER AND JEWELSThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the most holy Father , " he declared . Benvenuto shrugged his shoulders indifferently . " If you prefer , " he said , " tell him that an artist like Cellini can be as stubborn as a Pope ! " Chapter XXIISo COMPLETE was the breach between Clement and his former favorite that two months passed with no word exchanged . For days after Benvenuto reported his quarrel with the Pope , Raffaello and Lucilla lived in hourly dread lest the Bargello appear to drag the impudent youth to Sant ' Angelo and punishment . They could not believe that the hot-tempered Pontiff would brook such insolence , or fail to demand completesatisfaction . But as Clement manifested his resentment only by his silence , they transferred their apprehensions to Benvenuto himself . During these weeks his gay-hearted approach to life changed into a bitter morbidness . His selfassurancetranslated itself into a sullen determination nothing could affect . Lucilla made it a point to be at the shop each morning to greet him cheerfully as he came from his home to settle down to work , but his response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fast destroying himself by worry and overlonghours of application , " she said anxiously to her father . " He refuses to accept any suggestion I make for his relaxation . His mind dwells only on the quarrel with his Holiness . " " We can do no more , " Raffaello admitted sadly . " I have offered him gold of my own to use on the chalice , so that by showing progress he may prepare the way for Clement to relent . But he repulses me even as he does you . " Had Benvenuto 's foresight been equal to Raffaello 's the Pope would have found it easier to effect a reconciliation . In spite of his well-founded resentment , he missed the colorful personality of his favored goldsmith . As Alessandro had once remarked , Cellini 's conceit added gaiety to a dull Court . More177178 DAGGER AND JEWELSthan all else , Clement missed the opportunity of enjoying the expressions of beauty as they came from Benvenuto 's tools . Tobbia 's progress with the unicorn 's head was disappointing , and the comparison filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , and the model was being translatedinto the magnificent completed piece , the Pope followed the work so closely that he almost felt himself holding the chisel in his own hand . He had anticipated the same enjoymentwith the chalice , but the artist 's insubordination made this impossible . The Pope 's dignity had to be preserved . Clement waited for the young man to make the first advances , but Benvenuto continued to nurse his resentment . Yet the regret did not rest wholly with the Pontiff . In his heart Cellini felt an affection for his master which he had yielded to none other except Raffaello . He understood the capricious nature , and at times he longed to infect the Pope with his own daring and self-confidence . He knew well that he had tried Clement 's patience beyond endurance , and that the Pope 's leniency , even under violent protest , was in itself an evidence of friendship . Benvenuto might rail against the injustice of his treatment , yet unknown to any one he spent much time in fashioning a medal of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which he wrought the expression of his love . When at length Clement could endure the suspense no longer , he sent Messer Roberto Pucci to discover what Benvenutowas doing . At first the artist was resentful of the visit , but he found Roberto so charming a companion that his objectionsquickly vanished . Yet the messenger could take back to his master only a report that work upon the chalice was at a standstill , and this knowledge kept alive the resentment . Why could not his stupid goldsmith afford the Pontiff some excuse to relent and restore him to his favor ? THE GORGEOUS ADVENTURES OF CELLINI 179Cellini 's rivals now felt that Clement was in a receptive mood for any trick they might devise against his former favorite . Pompeo , again thwarted by his rival 's good luck in preserving the Pope 's jewels against his attempt to have them stolen , kept himself well posted through his relative , Traiano , and awaited his chance to strike another blow .

" " Were I to do that , " the Pope replied gloomily , " two unfortunatethings would happen . First , I should be badly served in the Mint , which concerns me greatly ; and secondly , I should certainly not get the chalice . You do not know Benvenuto . " Pompeo smiled grimly at Clement 's ignorance of his relations with his rival . He made it a point to secure the influence of the Milanese gentlemen who were in conspiracy with Salviati , and their counsels finally prevailed . Pompeo contrived to have himself made the messenger to convey these tidings to Cellini , and hastened in high spirits on his embassy . Benvenuto had scrupulously avoided his rival since the affair in Florence , and was surprised to see him enter the shop . He gave him a casual nod , and continued with his tools . " Well , well ! " Pompeo exclaimed . " The great artist is really at work ! From what I heard at the Palace , I was led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " State your business , Pompeo , " Benvenuto said sharply , " and leave promptly . There is not room enough here for both of us . " " I bring pleasant news for you , Cellini .
