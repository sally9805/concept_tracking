THE American Federation of Labor , in its October Survey of Business , taking its figures from the International Labor Office , an appendage of the League of Nations , said : " While unemployment in Germany , England and Italy has declined and the jobless army in Europe has shrunk from 8,400,000 to 7,400,000 in the last year , American industry has not succeeded in putting the unemployed to work . There are 50 per cent more out of work in America today than in all Europe . " Meantime , our country is supporting 3,000,000 foreign nationals at a cost , since the depression began , of about $400,000,000 . We have done it at a time when millions of native-born Americans are unemployed and are welfare dependents . One out of every seven on relief has been an alien . No country in the world does what we do for aliens . This is the aspect of the alien problem which , in its new developments , presents three distinct ramifications : 1 . Aliens on relief . 2 . Aliens at work . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send our jobless aliens home , paying for their passage ninety dollars each , a total outlay of $270,000,000 . If done , it would have saved $130,000,000 and helped to solve a problem that continues to plague American recovery . Instead , we made citizenship cheaper by reducing the naturalization fees and made easier the escape from the twilight zone of foreign responsibility . How Europe Shifts the Burden C ARRYING a heavy ballast of foreign nationals , the United States has appeared to be the world 's greatest laggard in unemployment reduction . Aliens on relief or at work in the United States have their volume matched in the unemployment decreases pridefully announced by Europe . Our losses over here in doles and wages paid to aliens is reflected in employment gains over there . Relieved of what we are carrying for them , the European countries plunge upward into brighter economic conditions . For instance , the International Labor Office at Geneva reports that in 1934 Germany reduced its unemployment by 671,897 . German immigrants entering the United States since the close of the World War numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatherland , they are counted now among our workers or public charges . Italy 's unemployment reductions in 1934 were 238,235 , and Italian immigrants arriving here in the years 1919 to 1935 were 604,613 . The British employment improvement in Great Britain for 1934-35 was 188,614 . Immigrants from England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland since the Armistice numbered 171,801 , while 413,391 ) others came from C'anada , Australia and other springboards in the same period . Not that all the new workers of Europe have the exact nationality equivalent that is to he found among our aliens on relief , but in the final pooling of totals , including our aliens in jobs , whatever the employment gains of European countries amount to are our losses in the end . Their citizens , who are now our aliens , have been trapped among us , and we cling to them and they to us . Always , in former depressions here and in all depressions abroad , including the present one , aliens have had to take care of themselves . In the earlier economic crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found . This crisis was different in that it was universal , touched all countries . Many European countries repatriated their aliens and faced conditions only with their own nationals . Our attitude toward foreign nationals has been to treat them as citizens . So we put them on relief here , in a state of comfort that they could not have found in their own countries , had they been working in them . We have clothed them . We have housed them . We have fed them . As rapidly as possible , we made work for them . We have kept employed those who had jobs . We have refused to deport those illegally in the country when it involved breaking up a family . What was offered to them , they accepted . Some have grumbled when restrictions were imposed . Others have taken liberties in this , their trial citizenship . I might cite those aliens who have been sending to relatives and others in their hirthlands the surplus of what was given them or that they had earned . Most ungrateful of all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at the overthrow of the Government that is giving them food and shelter . Another economic trend which increases apprehension concerning our aliens is that , among the very countries that are flooding us with their goods and products , there are those which furnished us with the aliens we are assisting . At a time when the other nations are putting economic walls around themselves and the tariff barriers of the United States are being removed , there enters the question of safeguarding the economic structure we all live in . In the great cities , the alien pro-Portion of those on relief exceeds one out of seven . One out of every five public charges in New York is of alien stock ; one out of two along the Mexican border ; one out of five in Cleveland and Detroit , and one out of six in Chicago and Los Angeles . Monthly relief benefits paid to aliens averaged $28.95 , the same as given citizens . The spread was from $46.31 per family in New York State to $7.50 in Oklahoma . Those in the largest cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Boston and Philadelphia averaging $49.72 , $55.96 and $43.92 , respectively . In the Federal made work , known variously by the initials CWA , CCC , PWA and WPA ? which are essentially relief , but in another form  --  the aliens and citizens drew the same pay , I can imagine many persons of international ideals reading what we have done for our aliens with increasing irritation , and finally exclaiming : " Well , what of it ? " Just this : Our aliens , whom we are now supporting , came of their own free will , and neither the desire for freedom of conscience in religious matters nor the longing for civil and political liberties had anything to do with their prying loose from the Old World . They came to make money , and they are here at the wrong time . They are human liabilities shifted from one jurisdiction into another . Their countries will gladly let us have them when times are bad over there , but once let a new war start , and Europe takes back its nationals quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leave their country with the intention of remaining abroad . A person leaving one of these countries with the idea of remaining permanently in the United States , ipso facto loses his citizenship , and that country is usually likely to refuse to accept him back , on the ground that he has lost his citizenship , unless he is needed for the army or brings new wealth From America . Other countries have laws which deprive their nationals of citizenship if they have served in a foreign army . Each foreign country is the judge as to what . kind of citizen it is willing to take back . Jesting at a Generous Uncle H ERE is a bit of dialogue taken from a Central European newspaper : " ' Jakie wants to come home , ' timidly said a mother to her father , a large landowner . " ' What is he doing now ? ' asked the grandfather . " ' Oh , he is on relief in America . ' ' " What ? Does n't he know when he is well off ? Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " The relief given Mexicans in the four states of the Southwestern frontier ranged from ten dollars to forty-five dollars monthly for each family . Texas , at its peak of 1,110,283 on relief early in 1935 , had 15 per cent , or about 165,000 , of Mexican aliens . A large slice of the remainder were aliens of other nationalities . Seventy per cent of those on relief in Laredo were Mexicans : the same percentages running in the counties along the Rio Grande east to Brownsville and west almost to El Paso . The Mexican relief at El Paso was 30 per cent , and at San Antonio it was 20 per cent . Those at the top in charge of relief do not know what percentages were aliens . The information had to be obtained locally , Public officials in all cities , fearing criticism of the Federal policy of universal relief , generally lean backward and seek to minimize what has been done for aliens as against the help given to citizens . They put forward the suggestion that " many of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . " This is pure speculation and is something they can not go into accurately because that particular data is not on the original relief cards . The cards are filled out with data from voluntary statements made by individuals . It is hardly probable that any alien illegally in the country would admit it to a relief worker . Outlaw aliens would declare themselves to be citizens . So here again is where the records fail . Handing the Foreigner His Hat M R. EDWARD CORSI , former United States Commissioner of Immigration of the New York District , who until recently was director of the home relief of New York City , himself born in Italy , when testifying before a municipal inquiry in New York said : " I estimate that there are about 1,500,000 aliens in the United States who are on relief . " Twice that number is probably more accurate than the Corsi guess , which was made before relief reached its peak . His estimate was made at the Caine hearing where he was advocating voluntary repatriation at ninety dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Mr. Corsi insisted : " To send them back would be cheaper in the long run . " Continuing on this subject , he said : " I think , as to the question of supporting the alien generally , an alien in America is a potential American , and when he shows his intention of becoming an American citizen under the laws and traditions , we are bound to his support while he remains a part of the official family . However , f think that in cases where the alien here is a victim of our depression . and wants to get hack to his own country , the Federal Government ought to use its relief funds for the purpose of providing passage home for that alien and not carry hint permanently on the relief rolls , either in this City or in any other city . " Mr. Corsi wished to have it understood that his repatriation proposal did not extend to aliens illega  --  Y in the country . After stating that the immigration authorities had never determined how many aliens were illegally here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he testified : " When we have an alien on the rolls who is illegally in the country , the United States owes him nothing , and the only thing to do is to deport him back to the country he came from , and at that country 's expense . " How many uncounted aliens are illegally in the country is not likely to be known until legislation is pro- vided for the registration of all aliens as a prerequisite to obtaining employment or receiving relief . The Department of Labor as now constituted is flatly against the registration of aliens . Its position is as follows : " In the countries of Europe where the alien // population consists very largely of visitors or , in certain countries , of contract laborers , and where aliens constitute but . a small percentage of the total population , it is comparatively easy to identify and register aliens . It is likewise easy in such countries for the government to take measures to prevent aliens from working , because , ordinarily , their numbers are limited and they are not tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the United States the reverse is true . We have a population of approximately 122,000,000 people , and of that number , 40,000,000 , or approximately one-third of the population , are of foreign birth or foreign parentage . Less than 5,000,000 are aliens in the legal sense  --  that is , persons of foreign birth or nationality who have not been naturalized . " Should an attempt be made to register aliens  --  as distinguished from general registration  --  and to require them to prove their registration before being given employment or to report at stated intervals to the police authorities , as is the case in certain other countries , we would not only be imposing a handicap upon them but upon a large percentage of the 35,000,000 citizens who are of foreign birth or immediate foreign extraction . This is due to the fact that many citizens of foreign birth or foreign parentage bear the same physical characteristics and have much the same general appearance and much the same accent as the less than 5,000,000 aliens . " If employers were required to give preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would find it necessary to obtain documents not only from the less than 5,000,000 aliens in the country but from a very large part of the : 35,000,000 who are of foreign birth or foreign parentage . They would naturally resent this discriminatory treatment against them , and endless trouble and confusion would result . Even more important , this would serve to set up in the United States a discriminatory policy between the citizens of recent foreign extraction and citizens of older stock . " The Synthetic Citizen This is contrary to the opinion that a nation comes out of its past , and is more than an economic federation , but is a mingling of the same sort of people over many years . How many years ? One hundred years , at least , is the gauge used by the countries of Europe . Whenever in the public , life of the Old World you find naturalized French , English , Germans or Italians , they do not occupy official posts at the gates of the country . The late Raymond Poincar6 , former president of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Like the roots of a river-bank willow with its branches spread beautifully over the water , the made citizen belongs partly to the land he springs from . Give me only the third generation for the frontier personnel . " George Washington in a general order from his army headquarters on July 7 , 1775 , said : " No man shall be appointed a sentry who is not a native of this country . " On July 10 , 1775 , he ordered the recruiting service " not to enlist any person who is not American born . " On March 17 , 1778 , when 100 men were to be chosen to guard the commander in chief , he ordered , " They must be American born . " Ellis Island has never been harshly 100-percent American . Personnel of immigration and naturalization control from Washington is invariably picked sympathetically , from the " more understanding two-country citizenship , either naturalized or of foreign parentage , " which may account for the almost fierce opposition of the Department of Labor to the very idea of finger-printing arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or public officials to report aliens asking for relief . The O'Day Resolution On August 23 , 1935 , the House of Representatives , by a vote of 201 to 119 , with 110 members not voting , adopted the O'Day resolution asking the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization to violate the existing immigration law by continuing a stay of deportation until March 1 , 1936 , affecting 2600 aliens unlawfully in the United States . These were the so-called " hardship cases " of aliens who , under the law , should have been deported two years ago , but who have successfully stood off deportation on the grounds that many of the aliens had married American women , and children have been born to these families ; the children being American citizens regardless of the race or citizenship or status of their parents , by dower of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution . Mrs. Caroline O'Day , author of the resolution , is representative at large of New York , which , in its metropolis , has the greatest mixture of peoples the world has ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miss Perkins , Secretary of Labor , and is vice president of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt 's Val-kill Shop for the reproduction of early American furniture at Hyde Park , New York . Mrs. O'Day has said with great earnestness : " These deportations would have meant the breaking up of a great many families . . . . All of us in this House are descendants of aliens who settled this country . These aliens and their descendants have made this nation what it is today . Whether our ancestors came over in the Mayflower or in the steerage , we are descendants . " Representative Robert Alexis Green , Democrat , of Florida , responded : " Almost every one of these aliens slipped in , sneaked in , stole their way in , contrary to the laws of our nation . Now we are asked to make lawful that entry , and place these men and women on a parity with immigrants who came to America through our law and now abide by our law . " Representative William W. Blackney , Republican , of Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not by resolution set aside the laws of the land . This Congress has passed so many unconstitutional laws that some members think we can set aside laws by resolution . " Lodging a final but ineffectual protest against the resolution , Representative Joe Starnes , Democrat , of Alabama , said that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization " brought no proof , no facts , no files before us and he made no attempt to classify the eases whatsoever . " Once there was a time when deportation records at the Department of Labor were as open as sunlight , and the identities of aliens " moved on " were made known . No longer . Rejected citizenship is treated by silence as to names , unless some very special reason for publicity arises in a single case . Figures in totals is now the method . Deportations in the fiscal year 1935 were 8319 , of whom seventeen were " anarchists and kindred classes , " and 4052 Mexicans . In 1934 they were 8879 , of whom twenty were " anarchists and kindred classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mental or physical defectives , people without proper visas or who were in the country for some other illegal reason . The two years represent a considerable drop in deportations from the five previous years , which were : 1929 , 12,908 ; 1930 , 16,631 ; 1931 , 18,142 ; 1932 , 19,426 , and 1933 , 19,865 . Biting the Hand That Feeds Them During last slimmer a Federal handout surprisingly gave the names of 151 aliens who were criminals as having been deported . It occasioned quite a flurry until the news correspondents looked twice at the release , to discover that it was not . from the Department of Labor , but was headed " Department of Justice . " " We had nothing to do with giving out those names , " said an official at the Department of Labor . " President Roosevelt had the Department of Justice issue them . " It developed that they were aliens who were serving time in the then-overcrowded Federal prisons , and who had been pardoned en bloc by an Executive Order from the White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finished their terms and became lost in unregistered and easy-going America . I have seen official records of relief stations in New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , El Paso , San Francisco , Seattle , Detroit , Cleveland and other cities which show that aliens who are Communists are among those who have been given relief checks and orders for supplies , and who have the bad taste to continue to proclaim themselves Reds . When I say " Communists , " I mean registered Communists possessing membership books in the party , and not Communist sympathizers or alien-minded Americans . The majority of these full-fledged Communists on relief are from Russia , Poland , Italy and the Balkans , from which regions they have brought radical and un-American ideas . The outstanding classic case of relief given to an alien is that of the man who calls himself Harry Bridges , the radical labor leader of the Pacific Coast , who came to California from Australia some fifteen years ago as a sailor aboard the steamship Ysabel . His complete name is said to he Henry Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " although he was a leader in the strikes which have repeatedly paralyzed the shipping industry of San Francisco , Los Angeles and Seattle . Commenting on these strikes , Lincoln Steffens , the author , of Carmel , California , who knows the real Bridges , said : " Those strikes were well run , the party organization is the best , better than any Communist Party in this country , far better than the G. 0 . P. , the Democratic machine or any reform movement I have ever known . " Bridges applied to the Associated Charities of San Francisco on August 4 , 1932 , for relief for himself and family . He asked only for food and a quart of milk daily . He said he could pay his own rent . He was allowed $2.21 a week plus the quart of milk . He went off this relief on February 18 , 1933 . From this date to June 18 , 1934 , Bridges subsisted without public help , but he then came back to the Emergency Relief Administration , the Federal-sponsored relief handout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down : Bridges , harry  --  Burn Melbourne , Australia , 7/29/99 .

University of California Hospital records show that Harry Bridges , then living in Seventh Street. , San Francisco , was treated in the clinic in 1925 . Mrs. Agnes Bridges was treated there in 1924 . She gave her address as Pierce Street . The Bridgeses recently have been living in Pine Street , San Francisco , and the radical labor leader says he is receiving thirty-five dollars a week as president of the San Francisco Longshoremen 's Union . He denies that he receives additional pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have filed a declaration of his intention to become an American citizen on July 13 , 1921 , at New Orleans . A petition for citizenship was filed by him in June , 1928 , at San Francisco , but his naturalization was never completed . Dissatisfied Relief Clients Alien Communists were among the leaders of several grievance committees to call upon the FERA heads at Albuquerque , New Mexico , early this year . The protestants demanded free lights , water , increased allowances of groceries , milk for children and other special concessions . They asked that the large committee of twenty members be allowed to see the administrator himself . This was refused . The group tried to force an entrance . The janitor turned a fire hose on them , and some ten men were arrested and temporarily confined . A group of about fifteen protesting Communists and Communist sympathizers , including five aliens , were thronged at the " gate " in the outer office when I called to see Frank Y. McLaughlin , the engineer administrator in San Francisco of the California Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was observed that the loud tones came from the aliens . Lola de in Torriente , aged twenty-two , graduate of the University of Cuba , good-looking , and eloquent in the Spanish language , has been the alien firebrand among the Mexicans on relief in the Southwest . Shortly before the rioting at Gallup , New Mexico , which resulted in the killing of Sheriff Carmichael early this year , she made several speeches in different places in that state . She was effective in rousing Mexicans to march on the relief stations . Lola was subsequently made the I object of deportation proceedings , although it is not generally understood that aliens may not be deported under our laws merely because they are radical in their views ; it is necessary to show either that they are anarchists , or that they believe in or advocate the overthrow of the Government by force or violence , or that they are affiliated with organizations having such beliefs or aims , " I only try to get some better food from the relief stations for the poor Mexicans , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but America has recognized Soviet Russia . I do not come from cold Moscow ; I come from beautiful Havana . " New York 's Alien Bread Line None of the alien Communists who took part in the concerted drive against relief stations wanted to go back to where they have a scheme of government similar to what they advocate throughout the world ; they all talk about overthrowing the Government by violence , yet they are intensely eager to stay here . In New York City there have been several checks made of the number of aliens upon relief , but no attempt has been made to set apart those who are registered Communists . The first New York test of October 19 , 1934 , showed that 9.77 per cent of the heads of households were aliens and 6.34 per cent were aliens who had received their first papers , or a total of 16.11 per cent . Upon the basis of three and one-half persons to the alien family , which is the specific size that has been fixed by the statisticians as a standard alien family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers was 115 , - 430 and the number of those with first papers was 75,446 , or a total of 190 , - 876 . This was the estimate that was drawn from about 340,000 relief cases . But the peak case load in New York came later . It reached nearly 600,000 relief cases in the state . That would be a total number of persons around 2,500,000 , and of about 350,000 aliens  --  at least . 300,000 in New York City . A second official search for the number of aliens on relief was made on August 9 , 1935 , four months after the high point of relief . Some 10,016 sample cases covering seventeen relief districts were examined . The average size of a family of citizens was 3.6 persons per case ; for alien families . 3.5 persons , and first-paper families , 3.8 persons . The distribution : Citizens , 79 per cent ; first papers , 6 per cent ; aliens , 14 per cent , and no record or doubtful , 1 per cent . The best information secured upon subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 300,000 aliens and members of alien families have been public charges in New York City alone , and still are , for that matter . Dr. Ralph G. Hurtin , director of relief statistics for the Emergency Relief Bureau , and who has returned to his post as statistician with the Russell Sage Foundation , said : " Part of the reason for the dearth of information concerning aliens on relief throughout the country is the fact that the Federal Emergency Relief Administration has not included this item on its recommended forms for records of relief eases . I believe the reason was that it was felt that recording the information might . lead to discrimination against persons of alien birth . " Detroit has its alien facts at its finger tips through the enterprise of the Wayne County Welfare Relief Commission , which conducted a look-see into employability and unemployability early this year , In all of Wayne County there were 28,060 case loads , representing about 100,000 needy individuals in families , besides a great number of single homeless men . Of this total the American-born were 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , and aliens with first papers or a. declaration of such intention . 10 per cent . A conservative estimate is that approximately 25,000 aliens and members of alien families were on relief in Wayne County and that at least 75,000 additional foreigners throughout the state of Michigan were being carried as dependents . Los Angeles County in California : Families on relief , 72,486 ; single men , 18,229 , and single women , 7885 , or about 270,000 persons on September 6 , 1935 , at which time the totals had fallen 40 per cent from the high point . Roy W. Pilling , director of the Los Angeles Relief Administration , had a special survey made to determine , first , the number of Mexican aliens receiving aid and , second , the number of other aliens . The report on this survey stated : " There are , in cases , 7769 Mexican alien families and 5039 other alien families , making 12,808 alien cases . These cases , broken down into man , woman and child , show a total of 4S,340 individuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as alien , Los Angeles exceeds San Francisco , where the aliens ran to 12 per cent . However , 27 per cent of San Diego 's relief work was for aliens . Cleveland has been feeding and caring for about 12,000 alien families , or some 47,000 individuals ; slightly under 20 per cent of the total relief at the peak . Boston averages 10 per cent aliens , not counting those with first papers  --  about 10,000 individuals . In the factory towns and cities of Massachusetts there are some 55,000 additional foreigners who have been helped . Three Million Mouths to Feed Chicago has had about 75,000 alien relief cases , in which , plus the aliens helped as individuals , there were some 300,000 aliens and members of alien families . The peak load , aliens and citizens , came during March , 1935 , when 202,370 resident families received aid from public agencies . To arrive at the total of 3,000,000 aliens on relief in the United States was not difficult . The number found at any one time is approximately 50 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the spring of 1033 , Then there were included alien figures from such cities as Pittsburgh , Seattle , Baltimore , Philadelphia , Minneapolis , Milwaukee , St. Louis , Providence , Buffalo , Newark and Paterson , plus estimates of aliens on relief from state relief headquarters in such states as Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Maryland , Ohio , Washington , Wisconsin , New Jersey , Colorado , Rhode Island and the Dakotas . In fact , the totals ran well above 3,000,000 , which is a conservative and consistent rock-bottom . Mr. Wilfred S. Reynolds , executive secretary of the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission , said : " The primary necessity with respect to the aliens is for regulation at the gates of entry . We ought to make entrance requirements more strict , and provide automatic deportation if the immigrant has not taken first steps to become a nooses DV 055 Rain citizen within a year after his arrival . But to deport noncitizens who come to this country without any warning of such requirements does not seem just . " He might well have added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . Mr. Reynolds made a test of voluntary repatriation . From July 3 , 1934 , through September 21 , 1935 , a total of 92 relief cases was sent back to the countries from which they came . Mostly single persons , although there were several couples . Mr. Reynolds ' policy was to make definite advance arrangements for their home-coming in their native lands . Correspondence was entered into with relatives or friends . The number received back in this manner is an excellent yardstick of Europe 's attitude toward nationals shifted into the ' United States . The countries and the number of nationals taken were : Yugoslavia , seven ; Czechoslovakia , three ; Ireland , two ; Germany , nine ; Russia , one ; Austria , two ; Holland , two ; Denmark , five ; England , nine ; Greece , seventeen ; Poland , nine ; Italy , six ; Sweden , eight ; Norway , one ; Spain , two ; Scotland , three ; Jamaica , one ; Lithuania , one ; Albania , one ; Switzerland , one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for voluntary repatriation collapse because of the unwillingness of foreign countries to accept prodigal sons and daughters . They are even opposed to receiving them when it is proved that they were destitute prior to entry . Many aliens come to America in a network of debt , their American adventure having been secured on the installment plan . The money for their westward passage plus the cost of get-. ting them into the United States , past the port restrictions of the **31;849;TOOLONG clause in the American Immigration Law , often is advanced by emigrant agents  --  men who make the migration of human beings their business , just as the Portuguese slave traders did with the African Negroes in the early Colonial days . Instances have been uncovered where money advanced from these foreign emigrant agents has been secured.by a mortgage on the land or other belongings of relatives of the person who sailed for the United States .

Since the depression set in during 1929 more than $250,000,000 has dribbled out of the United States in this fashion , the average of each order being extremely small . They are drawn in favor of people in the very small towns in foreign countries . I was not astonished when a Pole living on Kosciusko Street in Buffalo told me that he had been sending seven dollars to his native town near Warsaw every month out of the forty-four dollars he had been receiving from the Federal relief dispensers . He explained that his mother and two sisters were in need in Poland . The seven dollars bought thirty-seven zlotys , which , he said , was enough to keep the three women from starvation . That gave him thirty-seven dollars  --  thirty-seven for Poland and thirty-seven for America , but in different values .

Altogether he sent ninety dollars abroad , and , to do it , went without . beer and tobacco , which is something for a man of his upbringing . When scolded and threatened with deportation  --  which punishment. , in his case , under the immigration law , could go no farther than a threat  --  he offered to pay it back , upon the condition that he be provided with steady employment .
