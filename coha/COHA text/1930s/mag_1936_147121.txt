" My name is Josh Lee , but I 'm no joke , " announced a University of Oklahoma freshman when introduced to a church social in Oklahoma City some 25 years ago . Two years ago Oklahoma realized that Joshua Bryan Lee was no joke when it sent that professor of elocution at the State University to Congress , where he attracted immediate attention by mellifluous , effective speechmaking . Last week Representative Josh Lee , 44 , again proved his worth when he won the Democratic run-off primary for the U. S. Senate . Swamped by the largest majority ( 112,000 votes ) in Oklahoma history was Democratic Governor Ernest Whitworth Marland . <P> Nominee Lee 's Republican opponent in November will be another youngster , 38-year-old Herbert K. Hyde . A part-Indian who once studied elocution under Professor Lee , Nominee Hyde successfully prosecuted the kidnappers of Oilman Charles Frederick Urschel ( TIME , Oct. 2 &; 9 , 1935 ) . Last week he planned to out-josh Josh Lee , blanket Oklahoma with flamboyant oratory . Lee 's slogan : " From hoe-handle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From bootblack to U. S. Senator . " <P> Down to defeat in still another run-off went Democratic Representative Percy Lee ( " Do n't Call Me Percy " ) Gassaway , whose ten-gallon hat , cowboy boots , wing collar , shoestring tie and advocacy of birth control made him a minor notable in the 74th Congress . Victor on a cowhide radical program was jut-jawed , 27-year-old Lyle H. Boren who stepped out of a Government job for the campaign . Gassaway 's chief attack on him was his failure to marry , produce 14 children , as Gassaway had done . Replied Nominee Boren : " Old Noah or someone in the Bible was 500 years old before he married . All I need is time . " <P> Third Democratic winner of note last week in Oklahoma was Representative-at-large Will Rogers , no kin to his late great namesake , who beat Sam Houston III , grandson of Texas ' No. 1 hero .
