Politicians and their puppets were not the only ones who eagerly watched returns from last Tuesday 's elections . Vitally interested , too , were public utilitarians and their hundreds of thousands of stockholders . In more than a score of U. S. towns and cities voters were asked to decide last week whether or not they wanted municipal control of their light &; power services . <P> Those in favor of public ownership vociferously pointed out that the Public Works Administration was willing , even eager to lend money , that service rates would be lower since the plants would not operate for profit . Those in favor of private ownership declared just as loudly that the cities , already in financial straits , could not afford to risk deficits in the utility business ; that though rates might be lower , city treasuries would sharply miss the taxes now levied on privately-owned plants . After last week 's voting , neither side could claim a national victory , but both had things to cheer for . <P> Most important outcomes : <P> For Public Works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a substantial majority to authorize the city government to raise $10,000,000 , either by bond issue or by Federal borrowing , to build a power plant . The proposal was permissive , not mandatory , and was interpreted as an unemployment relief measure . Akron , Ohio voted 23,887-to-22,258 to purchase a power plant . A second referendum will have to take place before Akron actually goes into the power &; light business . In Sandusky , Ohio the issue was clear . The city decided to build a $1,400,000 light plant to be owned and operated publicly . Fleetwood , Pa. and Cicero , Ind . also voted in favor of public ownership of their power &; light plants . In Bradford , Pa. , Auburn , N. Y. , Defiance , Ohio , mayors were elected on public ownership platforms . <P> For Privateering , Salt Lake Citizens were to decide whether or not to build and operate their own plant at a cost not to exceed $18,000,000 . Utah Power &; Light Co. is one of the few enterprises in Salt Lake City not controlled by Mormons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project 2-to-1 . <P> For the third time in four years the voters of Portsmouth , Ohio defeated a proposal to operate their own electric facilities . Youngstown , Ohio voted against a bond issue which would have provided a municipally-owned distributing system . So did San Francisco . Burlington and Bordentown , N. J. , Atlanta , Ind . and Tyrone , Pa. decided against municipal operation of their lighting systems . <P> Well-run Cincinnati voted nay on municipal ownership for an interesting reason . The citizens there decided against buying Cincinnati Gas &; Electric 's plant not because they were unsympathetic to public ownership but because they plan to get their electricity from Cove Creek Dam , the Tennessee Valley Authority 's proposed power plant on the Tennessee River near Knoxville . The Cincinnati Southern , municipally-owned railway , passes within 10 mi. of the proposed dam-site . Transmission lines could be cheaply strung along the right-of-way into Cincinnati where current would be distributed by a publicly-owned system .
