Into Wilkes-Barre , Pa. parcel-post boxes one evening last week were dumped six cigar boxes , neatly wrapped in white paper . Each was labeled " Sample " and addressed to a local citizen . <P> First to receive one was Thomas J. Maloney , district president of the now disbanded United Anthracite Workers of Pennsylvania . He cut the strings , beamed : " Well ! Well ! An Easter present . " He pried open the lid . The Easter present tore off his left hand , mangled his right , shredded his face . <P> Second to receive his gift was Michael Gallagher , cemetery caretaker , who two years ago gave important testimony in a dynamiting case which grew out of the fight between the United Anthracite Workers and the United Mine Workers of America . After decorating graves for Easter , Caretaker Gallagher went home to lunch . His box blew him to bits . <P> Third box , addressed to Judge Benjamin R. Jones , was intercepted by postal officials . Former Sheriff Luther Kniffen 's box had a defective fuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his in a bucket of water . Sixth , apparently intended for Gorman , onetime umpire of the Anthracite Board of Conciliation , was intercepted at Hazelton before it reached another James Gorman . That evening fire , supposed to have been started by an incendiary bomb , gutted the first floor of St. Mary 's Rectory of Wilkes-Barre . <P> Few hours later State police calmed the terrified city by cutting off parcel-post service , arrested one unidentified suspect for what appeared to be a disastrous follow-up to the bitter fight three years ago between the defunct anthracite union and its more powerful conqueror , United Mine Workers of America .
