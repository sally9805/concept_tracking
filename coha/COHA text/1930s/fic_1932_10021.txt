She was n't in the true Southernwomantradition , at least not the old tradition . Her people were entirely respectable , her father very respectable . Surely her father had expected his daughter to be something she was n't . She knew that . She smiled , knowing it , although the smile was not intended to be seen by her father . At least he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than he was already upset . " Poor old Dad . " Her father was having a hard ride , she thought . " Life has been a buckingbronco for him . " There was that dream of a spotless white Southern womanhood . She had herself thoroughly explodedthat myth . Of course he did n't know , would n't have wanted to know . Ethel thought she knew where that spotless white Southern womanhood dream had come from . She had been born in Langdon , in Georgia , and at least she thought she had always had her eyes open . She was cynical about men and in particular about Southern men . " It 's pretty easy for them to talk about spotless white womanhood , getting what they want all the time , the way they do get it , usually from the browns , taking few enough risks . " I 'd like to show one of them . " But hell , why should I bother ? " Ethel was n't thinking of her father when she thought these thoughts . Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't moral . She was thinking of the whole present-day Southern white man 's attitude , of the way ao6 BEYOND DESIREp106puritanism had , after the Civil War , moved south .

Industrialism in its ugliest form coming in ... all that mixed up in people with religion ... pretensions , stupidity ... just the same it was physically a gorgeous land . The whites and the blacks in an almost impossible relation to each other ... men and women lying to themselves . All of this in a warm sweet land . Ethel was n't particularly , not consciously , aware of nature in the South ... the red sand clay roads , the piney woods , the Georgia peach orchards in bloom in the spring . She knew clearly that it might have been the sweetest land in all America , and was n't . The rarest opportunity white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the South ... how gorgeous it might have been ! Ethel was a modern . That old talk of a high fine Southerncivilization ... making gentlemen , making ladies ... she did n't want to he a lady herself . . . " That old stuff does n't go any more , " she told herself sometimes , thinking of her father 's standards of life , standards he would have so liked to press down upon her . Perhaps he thought he had pressed them down . Ethel smiled . She had the notion , rather firmly fixed in her mind , that , for a woman like herself , no longer young . .. she was twenty-nine .. . that she had better try to cultivate , if she could , a certain style in life . It was better even to be somewhat rigid . " Do n't give yourself too cheaply , whatever you do , " she had grown fond of telling herself .

What difference did it make who it was ? The act of giving would itself be something . There is a fence over which you would like to get . What matter what is beyond ? Getting over is something . To live recklessly . " Wait a minute , " Ethel said to herself . She smiled saying it . It was n't as though she had n't tried that , that reckless giving . It had n't worked . Still she might try again . " If only he would be nice . " She felt that , in the future , what she thought of as niceness would be very , very important to her . It would n't , the next time , be giving at all . It would be surrender . That or nothing . " To what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume a woman has to cling to something , to a belief that there is something for her , to be got through a man , " she thought . Ethel was twenty-nine . You get into the thirties and then the forties . Women who do not give themselves utterly dry up . They get dry-lipped , dry inside . If they give they get sufficiently punished . " But perhaps we want punishment . " " Beat me . Beat me . Make me nice . Make me beautiful , for a moment , anyway . " Make me blossom . Make me flower . " Ethel had got interested again that summer . It was rather nice . There were two men , one much younger than herself , one much older . What woman would n't be pleased having two men wanting her ... or for that matter three , or a dozen ? She was glad . Life in Langdon , but for the two men wanting her , would be , after all , pretty dull . It was rather too bad that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got interested and who had got interested in her was such a young one , much younger than herself , reallyio8 BEYOND DESIREp108immature , but there was no doubt she was interested in him .

" Do we want actuality ? " If we could decide that we could decide everything . " It may he an age gone blind and mad with actualities  --  machinery , science .

The younger man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver and he had come back to Langdon from the North , where he also had been in college . He did not come at the beginning of the vacation time , but rather late , in late July . The local paper said he had been out West with a school friend and now he had come home . He had begun coming into the Langdon public library , where Ethel worked . She was the librarian of the new public library in Langdon . It had been opened during the past winter . She thought about young Red Oliver . Without a doubt she was , from the moment she first saw him , when he returned to Langdon that summer , she was excited by him . The excitement took a new turn for her . She had never beforefelt like that toward a man . " I guess I 'm beginning to grow motherly , " she thought . It had become a habit with her to analyze her own thoughts and emotions . She liked it . It made her feel mature . " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " she thought . At least young Red Oliver did not seem like the other young men of Langdon . He seemed puzzled . And how physically strong he looked ! He had been on a Western farm for some weeks . Ile was brown and healthy-looking . He had come home to Langdon to spend some time with his mother before going off again to school . " It may be I am interested in him because I am myself a little stale , " Ethel thought . " I am a little greedy . He is like firm fresh fruit I want to bite into . " The young man 's mother was , to Ethel 's mind , a rather queer woman . She knew about Red 's mother . All of the town knew about her . She knew that , when Red had beenETHEL IIIP110at home the year before , after his first year in the Northern school and after his father , Doctor Oliver , died , he had worked in the Langdon cotton mills . Ethel 's father had known Red 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of Red 's return to town at table at the Long house . " I see that young Oliver 's home . I hope he 's more like his grandfather than his father or his mother . " In the library , when Red came in there , sometimes in the evening , Ethel looked him over . 1 le was already a strong man . How big Ins shoulders were ! " le had a rather large head covered with red hair. lie was obviously a young man who took life rather seriously . Ethel thought she liked that kind . " Maybe 1 do , maybe I do n't . " She had got , that summer , very self-conscious . She did n't like the trait in herself , would have liked rather being more simple , even primitive ... or pagan . " It may be because 1 am nearing thirty . " She had got it into her head that , for a woman , thirty was theturning point . That notion might also have come from her reading . George Moore ... or Balzac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is splendid , gorgeous . " Pluck her . Bite her . Eat her . I lust her . " That was n't exactly the way it was put . That notion was involved in it . It implied American men , able to do it , who dared to try doing it . Unscrupulous men . Daring men . Masculine men . " It is all this damn reading . .. women trying to rise , to take hold of life . Culture , eh ? " The old South , of Ethel 's grandfather and Red Oliver 's grandfather , had n't read . They talked about Greece and had Greek books in their houses , but they were safe books . No one read them . Why read when you can ride abroad overp111fields and command slaves ? You are a prince . Why should a prince read ? The old South was dead , but it certainly had n't died a princely death . Once it had a profound , a princely contempt for the Northern shop-keepers , money-changers , factoryowners , but now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop-keeping . Hating and imitating . Muddled for sure . " Am I any better ? " Ethel had to ask herself . Evidently , she thought , thinking of the young man , he has a desire to get hold of life . " God knows , so have I. " After Red Oliver came home and began coming often to the library and after she had got acquainted with him  --  she herself managed that  --  she got onto the fact that he sometimes wrote things on bits of paper . He wrote verses he would have been too shy to show her had she asked him . She did n't ask . The library was open in the evening on three evenings of the week and on such evenings he almost always came in . He explained , a little awkwardly , that he wanted to read , but Ethel thought she understood . It was because , like herself , he did n't feel much a part of the town . In his case it might be , partly at least , on account of his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I , " Ethel thought . She knew about his writing because at night , when he had come to the library and had got a book from a shelf , he sat down at a table and , not looking at the book , began to write . Ile had brought a writing tablet with him . Ethel walked about in the little reading-room of the library . There was a place she could stand , among the shelves of books , and look over his shoulder . He wrote to a friend in the West , a man friend . He tried his hand at verses . They did n't come off much , Ethel thought . She only saw one or two feeble attempts . When he had first come home that summer  --  after his visit to the Western friend  --  a fellow who had been in collegewith him , Red told her  --  he occasionally talked to her , a a BEYOND DESIREP112shyly , eagerly , with the boyish eagerness of a young man with a woman in whose presence he is moved but feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the college baseball team . Red had been at work during the early part of the summer on a farm in Kansas , belonging to that one 's father .... He came home to Langdon with his neck and arms burned by the sun of fields ... that also pleasing Ethel ... when he had first come home he did n't get a job at once . The weather was very hot but it was cooler in the library . There was a little toilet in the building . Ile went in there . He and Ethel had been alone in the building . She ran and read what he had been writing . It was Monday and he had been wandering about alone on Sunday . Ile had written a letter . To whom ? To no one . " Dear unknown , " he had written , and Ethel read the words and smiled . There was a little tight feeling about her heart . " He wants some one , a woman . I presume every man does . " Wu queer ideas nun had , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds a-plenty . Ethel knew about them too . The young nice kind had yearnings . They were trying to reach out toward something . Such a one was consciousalways of some inner hunger . Ile hoped some woman could satisfy it . If he did n't have a woman he tried to create one , in his own fancy . Red had tried to do that . " Dear Unknown . " He had told his unknown about his lonely Sunday . Ethel had read rapidly . To get back from the toilet to which he had gone he would have to pass along a short hallway . She would hear his footsteps . She could make her getaway . It was fun thus to peep into the boy 's life . After all he was only a boy . He had written to his unknown about his day , a lonely day . Ethel herself hated the Sundays in the Georgia town . She went to church but hated going . The preacher was stupid , she thought . She had thought that all out . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really religious , " she hadP113thought . They were n't . Perhaps her father was . Her father was a Georgia County Judge , and on Sundays he taught a Sunday-school class . On Saturday evenings he was always busy getting his Sunday-school lesson . He went at it like a boy , preparing for an examination in school . Ethel had thought , a hundred times , she had thought , " It gets into the air of the town on Sundays , the fakiness about religion . " There was something heavy and frigid in the air of the Georgia town on Sundays , particularly among the whites . She thought maybe the Negroes were all right . Their religion , the American kind of Protestant religion they had taken over from the whites ... perhaps they had made something of it . Not the whites . Whatever the South had once been , it had become  --  such towns as Langdon , Georgia , had become  --  with the coming of the cotton mills , Yankee towns . There had been a kind of deal made with God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day of the week . We 'll go to church . We 'll put up enough money to keep the churches going . " In return for that you give us Heaven when we get through with this life here , this life of running this cotton mill , or this store , or this law office ... . " Or being sheriff or deputy sheriff or being in the realestatebusiness . " You give us Heaven when we get through with all this and we 'll hold up our end . " To Ethel Long something seemed to get into the air of the town on Sundays . It hurt a sensitive person . Ethel thought she was sensitive . " I do n't see how it turns out that I still am sensitive , but I believe I am , " she thought . A kind of stalenessseemed to her to run through the town on Sunday . It got into the walls of buildings . It invaded houses . It hurt Ethel , made her ache . She had had an experience with her father . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quite eager-minded . He read books and wanted others to read books . Suddenly he had stopped reading . He seemed to have stopped thinking , did n't want to think . It was one of the ways in which the South , although the Southerner would never admit it , had fallen in with the North . Not to think , to read newspapers instead , go to church regularly ... not being any more truly religious ... listen to the radio ... join a civic club .. . boost for growth . " Do n't think .... You may begin to think what it really means . " In the meantime letting the Southern land go to pot . " You Southerners betraying your own Southern fields ... the old half-savage strange beauty of the land and the towns going . " Do n't think . Do n't you dare think . " Be like the Tanks , newspaper readers , radio listeners . " Advertise . Do n't think . " Ethers father insisted on Ethel 's going to church on Sundays . Why , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insistence . " You 'd better , " he said , with an air of finality . Ile was always trying to be final . It was because her position as town librarian was a semi-public position . " What will people say if you do n't ? " That was what her father meant . " Jesus , " she thought . Nevertheless she went . She had brought home a lot of her own books . As a younger man , her father might have found an intellectual bond with her . He could n't now . A thing had happened to him that , she knew , had happened to many American men , perhaps to most American men . There came a certain time , in the life of the American man , when he stopped dead . For some queer reason all intellectuality died in him . After that he thought only of making money , or of being respectable or , if he happened to lie the lustful sort , of getting women or living luxuriously . Innumerable books written in America were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies . Nearly all of them stated some problem of life , often an interesting problem . They went about so far with it and then stopped dead . ' 1 lip y stated a problem they themselves . would n't face , then suddenly they began crawfishing . They got out of it by suddenly becoming cheerful or optimistic about life , something f that sort . Ethel 's father was pretty sure about Heaven . At least e wanted to be . He was determined to be . Ethel had brought home with her , among her other books , a book by George 1 Dore , called The Brook Kerith . It was a story about the Christ , a moving tender story , c  --  thought . It had touched her . The Christ ashamed of what he had done . The Christ me up in the world and then come down . He began life as poor shepherd boy and after the terrible time when he prolaimedhimself God , when he went about leading men astray , hen he cried out , " Follow me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up on the cross to die ... . In George Moore 's beautiful book he did not die . A rich ling man loved him and took him down from the cross , ill alive but terribly maimed . The man nursed him , brought in back to life . He crept off , away from people and became shepherd again . He was ashamed of what he had done . He saw dimly , far into the future . Shame shook him . He saw , looking far to the future , what he had started . He saw Langdon , Borgia , Tom Shaw , the mill owner of Langdon , Georgia .. . he saw wars being fought in His name , commercialized arches , churches , like industry , controlled by money , churches turning away from the lowly , turning their backs  --  labor . He saw hatred and dullness spring up over the world . " Because of me . I have given mankind this absurd dream of Heaven , turning their eyes away from earth . " The Christ had gone back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been a good shepherd . The flocks were run down because there was no good ram and he went to find a ram . To shoot , to flood new life into the old sheep mothers . What an amazingly strong sweet human story it had been . " If my own fancy could but go wide and free like that , " Ethel thought . Once , when she had newly come home to her father 's house , after two or three years away , and had been rereading the book , Ethel had begun suddenly to speak of it to her father . She had some notion of getting close to hint . She had wanted to tell him the story . She tried . She would n't soon forget the experience . Of a sudden he had got the idea . " And the writer says IIe did n't die on the cross . " " Yes . It seems there is an old story of that sort in the East , told in the East . The writer , George Moore , an Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't die and was not born again ? " " No , not in the flesh . He was not born again . " Ethel 's father had got up from his chair . It was evening and the father and daughter were sitting together on the porch of the house . He had gone white . " Ethel . " His voice was sharp . " Do not ever speak of it again , " he said . " Why ? " " Why ? My God , " he said . " There is no hope . If the Christ did not rise again in the flesh there is no hope . " He meant ... of course he had not thought out what he meant ... this life of mine , I have lived here on this earth , here in this town , is such a strange , sweet healing thing that I can not bear the thought of its going out , completely and finally , as a candle is blown out . What staggering egotism and all the more amazing becauseEthel 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really a humble man , too humble . P117And so Red Oliver had had a Sunday . Ethel read what he had written , while he stayed in the toilet in the library . She read it hurriedly . He had merely walked out of town some miles , going out along the railroad that followed the river . Afterwards he had written about it , addressing some purely fanciful woman because he had no woman . He had wanted to tell some woman . He had felt what she felt on Sunday in Langdon . " I could n't stand the town , " he wrote . " It is better on week days when the people are sincere . " So he was also a rebel . " When they lie to each other and cheat each other it is better . " He had spoken of the big man of the town , of Tom Shaw , the mill owner . " Mother went to her church and I felt I ought to offer to go with her but I could n't , " he wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and then had cut out alone . He had seen Tom Shaw and his wife going to the Presbyterian church in their big car . It was the church to which Ethel 's father belonged , in which he taught the Sundayschoolclass . " They say Tom Shaw has got rich on the labor of the poor here . It is better to see him scheming to get richer . It is better to see him telling himself lies as to what he does for people than to see him thus , going to church . " At least Ethel 's father would never have questioned the new gods of the American scene , of the new industrialized Southern American scene , like that . He would n't have dared it , even to himself . The young man had gone out of town along the railroad track and had turned from the track , some miles out of town and had got into a pine forest . He wrote words about the forest and about the red Georgia land seen beyond the pine forest through trees . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man alone with nature on Sunday when all the rest of his town was in church . Ethel had been to church . She wished she had been with Red. ii8 BEYOND DESIREP118However , if she had been with him . . . Something stirred within her thinking of it . She put down the leaves out of the cheap pencil tablet on which he had written and returned to her desk . Red came out of the toilet . He had been in there for five minutes . If she had been with him in the pine forest , if the unknown woman to whom he had written , the woman who did n't evidently exist in reality , if it had been she herself . She might make it herself . " I might be very , very nice . " Then there might not have been any writing about it . There was n't any doubt but that he had given , in the scrawled words on the tablet , a kind of real feeling of the place he had been in . If she had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the line forest he might have been touching her with his hauls . A little quiver ran through her body thinking of it . " I wonder if I want hint ? " she asked herself that day . " It seems a little absurd , " she told herself . He was back at the table in the writing-room , writing again . He occasionally looked up , inn her direction , but her eyes avoided looking at hint while he looked . She had her woman 's way of managing that . " I am not ready to say anything to you yet . Why , you have been coming in here less than a week . " If she had been with him and had got him , as she alreadyfelt she could get him if she decided to try , he would n't have been thinking of the trees and the sky and the red fields beyond the trees nor yet of Tout Shaw , the cottonmillmillionaire going to church in his big car , telling himself that he was going there to worship the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , " Ethel thought . The thought pleased and at the same time , perhaps because he was so much younger than she was , amused her too . After he had come home that summer Red got a temporaryjob in a local store . He did n't stay at that long . " I do n't want to be a clerk , " he told himself . He went hack to the mill and , although they did not need men , they took him on again . P119It was better there . Perhaps , at the mill , they thought , " In case of trouble he will be on the right side . " From the window of the library , housed as it was in an old brick building , just where the region of stores ended , Ethel sometimes saw Red at evening going through Main Street . It was a long walk from the mill to the Oliver house . Ethel had already dined . Red wore overalls . He wore heavy workingmen 's shoes . When the mill team was having a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , a queer isolated figure in the town . " Like myself , " she thought . He was a part of the town and yet not a part of it . There was something nice about Red 's body . Ethel liked a certain free swing to his body . It remained , even when he was tired , after the day 's work . She liked his eyes . She had got into the habit of standing near the library window when , in the evening , he went home from his day 's work . Her eyes appraised the young man walking thus along the hot street of the Southern town . Quite frankly she thought of his body in connection with her own woman 's body . " It might be the thing I want . If he were only a bit older . " There was desire in her . Desire invaded her body . She knew that feeling . " I have n't handled that sort of thing very well in the past , " she thought . " Shall I take a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . " She was a bit ashamed of her own rather calculatingmind . " If it came to marriage . That sort of thing . He is so much younger than I am . It does n't work out . " It was absurd . He was not more than twenty , a boy , she thought . He was pretty sure , in the end , to find out what she had done to him . " Just the same I could if I tried . " Almost every evening , after his day 's work and when the library was open he came there . When he had begun thinking of her , it was when he had been working again in the factory for a week . he was only to stay in town some six or eight weeks more before he returned to school . . . already , although perhaps he was not quite conscious of what had been done to him , he wasp120all afire with thoughts of her .... " If I tried ? " It was evident no woman had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is always to be got by a clever woman . She thought herself fairly clever . " I do n't know what there is in my past record to make me think I 'm clever but I do think so , evidently , " she thought , standing thus near the library window as Red Oliver passed , seeing but not seen . " A woman , if she is any good can get any man some other woman has not already marked down . " She was half ashamed of her own thoughts concerning a young boy . She was amused by her own thoughts . P121ETHEL LONG 'S eyes were puzzling . They were greenishblueand hard . Then they were softly blue . She was n't particularlysensual . She could be brutally cold . She wanted sometimes to be soft and yielding . When you saw her in a room , tall and slender , well formed , her hair seemed brown . When light shone through , it became red . As a young girl she had been of the awkward tom-boy type , a rather excitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passion for clothes . She would have liked always to wear better clothes than she could afford . Sometimes she wished she had gone in for being a designer of clothes . " I could have made a success of that , " she thought . Most people were a little afraid of her . If she did not want them to come near , she had her own way of holding them off . Some of the men who had been attracted to her , and who had made no progress , thought of her as something of a serpent . " She has serpent 's eyes , " they thought . If the man , attracted to her , was at all sensitive , it was easy for her to upset him . That rather annoyed her , too . " I guess I want a brute of a man , one who will pay no attention to my whims , " she told herself . Often , that summer , after Red Oliver had got into the habit of going , at every opportunity , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , he thought , catching her eyes looking at him , that they invited everything . He had been in the West , with a young man , a friend , working during the early part of the summer on the farm of the friend 's father in Kansas and , as is usual with young men , 122 BEYOND DESIREp122there had been a good deal of talk of women . Talk of women had been mixed with talk of what the young men were to do with their lives . Both young men had been touched by modern radicalism . They had got that in college . They had been stirred . There was one young professor  --  he had taken a special fancy to Red  --  who had talked a good deal . He had lent him books  --  Marxian books , anarchistbooks . He was an admirer of the American anarchist , Emma Goldman . " I saw her once , " he said . He described a meeting in a small Middle-Western industrialtown , the local intelligentsia gathered in a little dark hall . Emma Goldman making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , went through the audience selling books . The audience was a little excited , a little frightened by the woman 's bold talk , her bold ideas . There was a dark wooden stairway leading up to the hall and some one carried a brick up there and threw it down . It went bumping down the stairs  --  boom , boom , and the audience in the little hall ... Men and women in the audience jumping to their feet . There were pale faces , trembling lips . They thought the hall was being blown up . The professor , then a student , had bought one of Emma Goldman 's books which he gave to Red . " They call you Red , ' eh ? It 's a significant name . Why do n't you be a revolutionist ? " he asked . Ile asked such questions and then laughed . " Our colleges have already turned out too many young bond-sellers , too many lawyers and doctors . " When he was told that Red , during the previous summer , had worked as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited . He thought both young men  --  Red and his friend , Neil Bradley , the young Western farmer  --  ought to devote themselves to some kind of effort to remake society , be frankly socialists or even communists , and he wanted Red , when he had finished school , to remain a laborer.  | " Do n't do it because of any good you think you can do humanity , " he said . " There is n't any such thing as humanity . There are only all these millions of individuals in a strange unaccountable situation . " I tell you to be a radical because being a radical is a little dangerous in America and will grow more dangerous . It is an adventure . Life is too safe here . It is too dull . " He found out that Red had a secret yearning to write . " All right , " he said cheerfully , " remain a laborer . That might be the supreme adventure in a great middle-class country , to remain poor , to consciously choose to be a common man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big bug .. . a buyer or seller . " The young professor , who had made rather a deep impression on the minds of the two young men , was himself almost girlish in appearance . There might have been somethinggii lish in him , but if that was true he concealed it well . He had himself been a poor young man but said he had never been strong enough to be a workman . " I had to be a clerk , " he said , " I tried being a worker . One year I got a job digging in a sewer in a Middle-Western city but I could n't stand it . " He had admired Red 's body and sometimes , in expressinghis admiration , had embarrassed Red . " It 's a beauty , " he said , touching Red 's back . He meant Red 's body , the unusual depth and breadth of the chest . He himself was small and slender and had sharp bird-like eyes . When Red had been on the Western farm , earlier that summer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , in the evening , drove into Kansas City . Neil had n't got his school teacher yet . Then he got one , the school teacher . He wrote Red lettersdescribing his intimacies with her . He had got Red started thinking about women , wanting a woman as he never had before . He looked at Ethel Long . How nicely her head sat on her shoulders ! The shoulders were small but they were well formed . Her neck was long and slender and there was a line , flowing down from her small head along her neck and losing itself under her dress , his hand wanted to follow . She was a trifle taller than he was , as he was inclined to stockiness . Red had broad shoulders . They were , from the point of view of manly beauty , too broad . He did not think of himself in connection with the notion of manly beauty although that college professor , the one who had spoken of the beauty of his body , the one who had made a special point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might have been a trifle on the queer side . Neither Red nor Neil ever spoke of that . he always seemed about to caress Red with his hands . When they were alone together he was alwaysasking Red to come to his office in the college building . He drew near . Ile had been sitting at his desk in a chair , but got up . II is eyes that had been so bird-like , sharp and impersonal , became suddenly , strangely , like women 's eyes , the eyes of a woman in love . It had given Red a queer uncertainfeeling sometimes in the man 's presence . Nothing had ever happened . Nothing had ever heat said . Red had begun haunting the library in Langdon . There were many hot still evenings that summer . Sometimes , after he had come from his job in the mill and had bolted his dinner he hurried away to practice on the ball field with the mill team , but the mill boys , after the clay 's work , were tired and could not keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball uniform , came back into town and went to the library . On three evenings a week the library was open until ten , although there were few enough people coming in . Often the librarian sat alone . He knew that another man in town , an older man , a lawyer , was after Ethel Long . It worried him , frightened him a little . He thought of the letters Neil Bradley was writinghim now . Neil had got in with a woman older than himself , and almost at once an intimacy had begun . " It was something glorious , something to live for , " Neil said . WasP125there a possibility of another such intimacy for himself with this woman ? The thought made Red a little frantic . It also frightened him . Although he did not know it then , Ethel 's mother havingdied and her one sister , older than herself , having marriedand moved to another Southern town and her father having married a second wife , she , like Red , was not too comfortable at home . She wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not come back there . She and her father 's second wife were almost of the same age . The step-mother in the Long household was pale , a pale blonde . Although Red Oliver did not know it , Ethel Long was also ready for adventure . As the boy sat sometimes in the evening , in the library , a little tired , pretending to read or write , furtively looking at her , furtively dreaming of possessingher , she was looking at him . She was weighing the possibilities of an adventure with the young man , little more than a boy to her , against another sort of adventure with a much older and quite different sort of man . The step-mother , after her marriage , had wanted to have a child of her own and none had come . She blamed her husband , Ethel 's father . She fussed at her husband . Ethel , sometimes at night , lying in her bed , heard her new mother  --  the thought of her as a mother was absurd  --  fussing at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room early . There was the man and wife , the woman scolding . She issued orders sharply  --  " do this . . . do that . " The father was a tall man with black hair , growing gray now . By his first marriage there had been twd sons and two daughters , but both of the sons had died , one at home , as a grown man , older than Ethel , and the other , the youngest of his children , as a soldier , an officer in the World War. ia6 BEYOND DESIREP126The older of the two sons had been sickly . He was a pale sensitive man who wanted to be a scholar , but who , because of illness , never finished college . He ( lied suddenly of heart failure . The younger son was like Ethel , tall and slender . Ile had been his father 's pride . The father had a mustache and a little pointed beard that , like his hair , had begun to get gray , but he kept it colored , usually doing the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was careless . People met him on the street one ( lay and the mustachewas streaked with gray and the next day , when they met him , it had become black and shiny again . His wife look it out on hint : shout his age . That was her way . " You have to remember you are getting old , " she said sharply . She said it sometimes with an air of kindliness but he knew and she knew that she was not being kindly . " I am wanting son willing I guess you are too old to give me , " she was thinking . " I want to bloom . Hero I am a pale woman , not very well . 1 want to he spread out , thickened and broadened , if you please , made into a real woman . I guess you ca n't do it to me , damn you . You are n't man enn enough . " She did n't say that . The man also wanted something . By his first wife , dead now , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were sons but both of the sons were now dead . He wanted another son . He had felt a little frightened when he had brought his new wife home to his house and to his ( laughter , Ethel 's sister , who was not married then . He had told the daughter at home nothing of his plans and she herself was married during the same year . He and the new woman had driven off together one evening , going to another Georgia town , sayingnothing to any one of their plans , and , when they were married , he had brought her home . His house , like the Oliver house , was out at the edge of town at the end of a street . There was a large old Southern frame house and there wasP127a sloping meadow beyond the house that belonged to him . He kept a cow in the meadow . Ethel had been away from home at school when all of this had happened . Then she came home for the summer vacation . A queer drama had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's new wife , the blonde young woman with a sharp voice , so few years older than herself , seemed to have become friends . The friendship was a sham . It was a game they played . Ethel knew and the new wife knew . The four people went about together . The younger sister , the one who was married soon after it began  --  thus , Ethel thought , getting out of it  --  did n't understand . It was as though two factions had been formed in the house : Ethel , the tall sleek-looking , somewhat sophisticated one , and the new pale blonde wife of her father in the one faction and the father and husband , with the younger daughter , in the other. 0 love , Little naked child with the bow and the quiver of arrows . More than one wise man had laughed at love . " There is n't any such thing . That is all nonsense . " Wise men had said it , conquerors , emperors , kings , artists . Sometimes the four walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Presbyterian church , walking there together through the hot Sunday morning streets . The Presbyterian preacher at Langdon was a man with stooped shoulders and big hands . His mind was infinitelydull . When , on week days , he walked through the town streets he thrust his head forward and held his hands clasped behind his back . He seemed like a man pushing forwardagainst a heavy wind . There was no wind . He seemed about to fall forward , to be lost in deep thought . His sermonswere long and very dull . Later , when there was laborra8 BEYOND DESIREp128trouble in Langdon and two of the workers in the mill villageat the edge of town were killed by deputy sheriffs , he said , " No Christian minister should perform the burial ceremonyfor them . They should be buried like dead mules . " When the Long family went to church , Ethel walked with the new step-mother and the younger sister walked with the father . The two women went ahead of the others , talking busily . " You do so love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the blonde woman said . " After your life in school , in the city , in Chicago ... to come home here ... to be so sweet to all of us . " Ethel smiled . She half liked the pale thin woman , her father 's new wife . " I wonder why father wanted her ? " Her father was still a strong man . l le was a big , a tall man . The new wife was malicious . " What a good little hater she is , " Ethel thought . At any rate , it was n't dull for Ethel , being with her . She liked it . All of this had happened before Red Oliver went off to school , when he was still a high school boy . There had been three summers after that , after her father 's marriage , followed by the marriage of her younger sister , when Ethel did not come home . I ) wring two of the summers she worked , and ( luring the third summer she attendedsummer school . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her A.B . from the university and had then taken a course in library work . A new Carnegie library had been secured for the town of Langdon . There had been an old one but every one said it was too small and unworthy the town . The blonde wife , named Blanche , had egged her husband on about the library . She kept at her husband , making him go to speak beforemeetings of the town 's civic clubs . Although he no longer read books he had still the reputation of being an in-P129tellectual . There was a Kiwanis Club and a Rotary Club . She herself went to see the editor of the town 's weekly newspaper and wrote articles for the paper . Her husband was puzzled . " Why is she so set on it ? " he asked himself . He did n't understand and was even ashamed . He knew what she was up to , getting the job as librarian of the new library for his daughter Ethel and her interest in his daughter , almost of her own age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even unnatural . Had he dreamed of some sort of quiet home life with his new woman , his old age comforted by her ? He had been under the illusion that they would be intellectual companions , that she would understand all of his thoughts , all of his impulses . " We ca n't do it , " he said to her , with a note almost of desperation in his voice . " We ca n't do what ? " The pale eyes of Blanche could be absolutely impersonal . She spoke to him as to a stranger , or as to a servant . He had always a way of saying things with an air of finality that was n't final . It was a bluff at finality , a hope for finality , never achieved with her . " We ca n't work like this , so openly , so obviously , to get this library put in , asking the town to do its share , asking the tax-payers to pay money to have this larger library and all the time  --  you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of running it over to Ethel . " It will look too much like a fixed-up thing . " He wished he had never got into the fight for the new library . " What does it matter to me ? " he asked himself . He had been led , pushed into it , by his new wife . It was the first time , since he had married her , that she had shown any interestin the cultural life of the town . " We ca n't do it . It will look like a fixed-up thing . " " Why , my dear , it is fixed up . " Blanche was laughing at ner husband . Her voice had grown sharper after her marriage . She had always been a woman without much color in her face , but before her marriage she used rouge.  |p130After  marriage she did n't bother . " What 's the use ? " she seemed to be saying . She had had a rather sweet mouth , like the mouth of a child , but , after marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after her marriage , about her whole being that suggested ... it was as though she belonged not to the animal but to the vegetable kingdom . She had been plucked . She had been laid carelessly aside , in the sun and wind . She was drying up . You felt it . She also felt it . She did not want to be what she was , what she was becoming . She did not want to he disagreeable to her husband . " 1 ) o I hate him ? " she asked herself . Her husband was a good man with an honorable position in the town and county . Ile was scrupulously honest , went regularly to church , was a devout believer in God . She had watched other women who had married . She had been a school teacher in Langdon , had come there from another Georgia town to he a teacher . Some of the other school teachers had got husbands . She had gone to visit some of them in their houses after marriage , and had kept in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their husbands called them " mother . " It was a kind of relationship , mother and child , a grown child who slept with you . The man went out and hustled . 1e made money . She could n't do it , could n't take that attitude toward her husband . He was so much older than herself . She kept declaringher devotion to her husband 's ( laughter , Ethel . She was becoming all the time more and more determined , cold and determined . " What do you think f have been up to about this library , getting this library ? " she asked her husband . Her tone frightened and disconcerted him . When she took on that tone , his world always seemed tumbling about his ears . " Oh , I know of what you are thinking , " she said . " You are thinking of your honor , of your standing in the eyes of the respectable people of this town . It is because you are Judge Long . " He had been thinking of just that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before he mar/tied her , she would never have used such a word in his presence . Before marriage she had always been very respectfultoward him . He had thought her demure , a quiet gentle little thing . Before marriage he had worried a good deal although he had said nothing to her of what was in his mind . He had been anxious about his own dignity . He had felt that his marriage to a woman so much younger than himself would cause talk . Often he had shivered thinking of it . Men standing before the drug store in Langdon and talking . He thought of men of the town , of Ed Graves , Tom McKnight , Will Fellowcraft . Some one of them might break loose at a meeting of the Rotary Club , say something publicly . They were always trying to be jolly , hail-fellows at the club . For weeks before his marriage he had not dared to go to a meetingof the club . He wanted a son . There had been two sons and they were both dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long illness of the older one , an illness that had begun in childhood that had led to his own deep interest in children . He had developed a passion for children , particularly for young boys . That had led to his accepting a place on the county school board . The children of the town , that is to say , the children of the more respectable whites , and in particular the sons of such families , all knew and admired him . He knew dozens of young boys by their first names . More than one older man , who had been a schoolboy in Langdon , who had grown up and had gone somewhere else to live , came back to Langdon . Such a man almost always came to see the judge . They called him " Judge . " " Why , hello , Judge . " There was such heartiness , such good will in the voices . Such a one said to him , " Look here , " he said , " I want to tell you something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " After all , a man wants to be an honorable man . " The man spoke of something that had happened , when he was a schoolboy . " You said so and so to me . I tell you it stuck in my mind . " The judge had perhaps taken an interest in the boy , had , in a time of boyish trouble , sought him out , trying to help . It had been the judge 's best side . " You would n't let me be a fool . Do you remember ? I was angry with my father and had decided to run away from home . You got it out of me . Do you remember how you talked ? " The judge did n't remember . He had always been interested in boys , had made boys his hobby . The fathers of the town knew it . He had that reputation . When he was a young lawyer , before he became a judge , he had organized a troop of boy scouts . He had been the scout master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men 's sons than with his own , had been rather severe with his own sons . He had thought it best . " Do you remember when George Grey , Toni Eckles and I got drunk ? It was night and I stole my father 's horse and buggy and we went to Taylorville . " We had got into a mess . It makes me ashamed yet , thinking of it . We came near getting arrested . We were going to get us some nigger girls . We had got arrested , being drunk and noisy . What young beasts we were ! " Knowing about it all , you did n't go talk to our fathers , as most men would have done . You talked to us . You had us into your office , one by one , and talked to us . For one , I will never forget what you said . " So , he had got them out of it , had hushed it up . " You made me feel the seriousness of life . I can almost say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge had been profoundly bothered and annoyed about the matter of the new library . " What will the town think ? "  |p133The  question was never off his mind . It had been a point of honor with him never to push himself or his own family . " After all , " he had thought , " I 'm a Southern gentleman and a Southern gentleman does n't do such things . These women ! " He thought of his younger daughter , married now , and of his dead wife . The younger daughter had been a quiet serious-seeming woman , like his first wife . She was pretty . After the first wife 's death and until he re-married she had been her father 's housekeeper . She had married a man of the town who had known her in high school and who had now gone to Atlanta where he had a job in a mercantile house . For some reason and although he often looked regretfullyback to the days with her in his house , the second ( laughter had never made much impression on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never got into trouble . When the judge thought of women he thought of his older ( laughter Ethel and of his wife Blanche . Were most women like that ? Were all women at bottom alike ? " Here I have worked and worked , trying to get a library for this town and now the whole thing has taken this turn . " He had n't thought of Ethel in connection with the library . That had been his wife 's notion . The whole impulse in himself ... he had been thinking about it for years .... There was n't enough reading done in the South . He hadknown that since he was a young man . He had said so . There was little intellectual curiosity among most of theyoung men and women . In intellectual development the Northseemed far ahead of the South . The judge , although he nolonger read , had faith in books and in reading . " Readingbroadens a man 's culture , " he kept saying . When the driveor the new library became more definite he went about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hespoke at the Rotary Club and got an invitation to speak alsothe Kiwanis Club . The president of the Langdon Mills ,   Torn Shaw , helped a lot . There was to be a branch at the mill village . The whole matter was arranged and the building , a fine old Southern residence , was bought and remodeled . There was Mr. Andrew Carnegie 's name over the door . And there was his own daughter Ethel appointed to be the town librarian . The committee had voted for her . It had been Blanche 's idea . Blanche had been the one who had kept at label to prepare herself . There had , to be sure , been certain whispers about town . " No wonder he was so hot on having a library . It broadens a man 's culture , eh ? It broadens his pocketbook . Pretty soft , eh ? A foxy scheme . " But Judge Willard Long was not foxy . He hated it all and had even begun to hate the library . " I wish I had let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to protest . He spoke to Blanche . " I think she had better withdraw her name . " Blanche laughed . " You ca n't be such a fool . " " l wo n't let her name be put up . " " Yes , you will . If necessary I will go down there and put it up myself . " The queer thing about the whole affair was that he could not think that his daughter Ethel and his new wife Blanche were really fond of each other . Had they simply entered into a conspiracy against himself , to hurt his standing in the town , make him seem to the town something he was n't , slid not want to be ? I le grew petulant . You bring what you hope and think is going to be love into your house and it turns out to be some new queer kind of hate you ca n't understand . There is something brought into the house that poisons the air . He wanted to speak of the whole matter to his daughter Ethel when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seemed to have drawn herself away . He wanted to take her aside and plead withp135her . He could n't . Nothing was very clear in his head . He could not say to her , " Look here , Ethel , I do n't want you here . " There was a queer notion in his head . It frightened and alarmed him . While in one moment it seemed the two had conspired against himself , in the next moment they seemed preparing for a kind of battle with each other . Perhapsthey sought it . Ethel , although she had never had much money to go on , was a dresser . In spite of Mrs. Torn Shaw , wife of the town 's rich mill owner , with all her money .. she had grown fat ... Ethel was obviously the best-dressed , the most up-to-date and stylish-looking woman in town . She was twenty-nine , and her father 's new wife , Blanche , was thirty-two . Blanche had let herself become a good deal of a frump . She did n't seem to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even very particular about bathing and when she came to table , sometimes , even her nails were not clean . There were little black streaks under her untrimmed nails . THE father asked the daughter to go with him on a trip into the country . He had long been on the county school board and had to go visit a Negro school , had said he would go . There was trouble about a Negro woman school teacher . Some one had reported that the woman , who was unmarried , was pregnant . He had to go and find out . It was a good chance for a real talk with his daughter . He might find out something about her and about his wife . " What has gone wrong ? You were n't , formerly , as you are now ... so tight ... so strange . " Perhaps she had n't changed . He had n't thought much about Ethel when his first wife and his sons were alive . Ethel sat beside her father in his car , a cheap roadster . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather finely drawn and she was well groomed . Her eyes told him nothing . Where had she got the money to buy  |p136such  clothes as she wore ? He had sent her off to the city , to the North , to be educated . She must have changed . There she sat beside him now , looking cool and impersonal . " These women , " he kept thinking , as they drove along . It was just after the completion of the new library . She had come home to help select the books and to take charge . At once he had felt something wrong in his house . " I am shut out , " he thought . " Out of what ? " Even if there was a war in his house , it would he better if he knew what it was all about . A man wanted to keep his own dignity . Did a man do wrong , trying to have , living iii one house , a daughter and a wife , both so nearly of the same age ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Ethel at home ? Although he was almost an old man there was in his eyes the troubled look of a troubled hop , : hid his daughter was ashamed . " We ought to chuck it , " she thought . Something had to be settled between : Blanche and herself . " What has he , poor man , to do with it r " Most men were very tiresome . They understood so little . The man sitting beside her iii the car that day , driving the car as they rode along red Georgia roads , through clumps of pine trees , over low hills ... it was spring and men were in the fields plowing for the next year 's cotton crop , white men and brown men driving mules . . . there was a smell of new-plowed ground and of pine trees ... the man sitting beside her , her father , was obviously the one who had done it to the other woman . .. that woman her mother now ... how absurd . . . that woman taking I , . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of that woman as her mother ? " I dare say he does n't quite know what he wants . " Men wo n't face things . How they hate to face things . " It is impossible to talk to a man , in such a situation , when he is your father . " Her own mother , when she was still alive , had been to Ethel . .. exactly what had she been ? The mother had been rather like Ethel 's sister . She had got married when she wasP137a young girl to this man , Ethel 's father . She had the four children . " That fact must be an intense satisfaction to a woman , " Ethel thought that day . A queer little tremor ran through her body , thinking of her mother , as a young wife , first feelingin her body the movements of a child . In the mood she was in that day she could think of her mother , now dead , as just another woman . There was something between all women few enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There might be a man . He would need to be a poet . " Her mother must have known , after she had been married to her father for a time , that the man she had married , although he had an honorable position in the life of the town and the county , although he became a judge , he was n't terribly mature , never would be mature . He could n't be mature in a real sense . Ethel did not know exactly what she meant by that . " If I could find a man to whom I could look up , a free-walking man , not afraid of his own thoughts . He might bring me something I need . " He might penetrate me , color all my thinking , all my feeling . I am this half thing . I want to be made into a real woman . " There was the thing in Ethel that was also in the woman Blanche . But Blanche was married  --  to Ethel 's father . And she had n't got it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to understand what it was . Being at home , in the house with Blanche , had helped . The two women did not like each other . They did . They did n't . There was a kind of understanding . There will always be something , as between women , no man will ever perhaps quite understand .   And yet , every woman , who is really a woman will , all her life , want that more than anything else in life  --  real understanding with a man . Had her mother achieved it ? Ethel looked sharply at her father that day . He wanted to talk about something and did n't know how to begin . She did nothing to help . Had the conversation he had in mind got started , it would have got nowhere . He would have begun , " You are at home here now , Ethel ... I hope you and Blanche will get along all right . I hope you will like each other . " " Oh , shut up . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman Blanche . .. None of the things Ethel thought that day were said . " As to me and your Blanche .. . it is nothing to me that you have married her . That is a thing outside me . You have undertaken to do something to her .... " Do you know that ? " " You do not know what you have undertaken . Already you have failed . " American men were such fools . There was her father . He was a good , an honorable man . All of his life he had worked hard . A good many Southern men . . . Ethel had been born and had grown up in the South ... she knew things ... a good many Southern men , when they were young ... there were brown girls everywhere in the South . It was easy for the Southern boy to find out certain physical things about life . The mystery penetrated . An open door . " It ca n't be so easy as all that . " If a woman could find a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father had made a bad guess in the woman he had picked as a second wife . That was obvious . If he had n't been so unsophisticated it should all have been plain to him before he married . The woman had worked him outrageously . She had decided to get him and so she had begun working along certain lines . She was getting a little faded and worn-out and so shep139perked up . She tried to appear unsophisticated , a soft-speaking , child-like woman . She was n't of course anything of the sort . She was a disappointedwoman . The chances were that , somewhere , there was some man she had really wanted . She had made a mess of that . Her father , if he had n't been such an honorable man . She was quite sure that her father , although he was Southern ... he had n't fooled about , when he was young , with the brown girls . " It might have been better for him now if he had done that , if he had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed was a good beating . " I 'd give her one if she were mine , " Ethel thought . There might be a chance , even with her . There was a kind of vitality to Blanche , something hidden away in her , down there under the paleness , under the dirt of her . Ethel 's thoughts returned , that day she rode with her father , to her own mother . The ride turned out to be a rather silent one . She managed to get her father to talking of his boyhood . He had been the son of a Southern planter who owned slaves . Some of his father 's acres still stood in his name . She managed to make him talk of the days when he was a young country boy , just after the Civil War , of the struggle of whites and blacks to adjust themselves to a new life . He wanted to talk of something else but she would n't let him . It was so easy to manage . As he talked she thought of her own mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had got a good man , an honorable man , a man , unlike most of the Southern men about , a man who was interested in books , who seemed intellectually alive . He was n't really . Her mother must soon have found that out . For the woman , Ethel 's mother , the man she had gotmust have seemed rather above the average . He did n't telllittle lies . He did n't chase off secretly after brown women . There were brown women everywhere about . Langdon , Georgia , was in the very heart of the old slave-owningp140South . The brown women were n't bad . They were unmoral . They had n't the white women 's problems . They were going to grow more and more like white women , facing the same problems , the same difficulties in life but ... In her father 's day , as a young man. flow ow had he kept so straight ? " I would never have done it , " Ethel thought . Such a man as her father would go ahead and perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon for that . Ile could n't give a woman what she really wanted . It might he no American man could . Ethel had just returned from Chicago where she had gone to school and where she had studied to be a librarian . She was thinking of her experiencesthere ... a young woman 's attempts to thrust out into life , what had happened to her in the few adventures she hersel f had made to get hold of life . It was a spring day . In the North , in Chicago , where she had been living for four or five years it would still be winter but in Georgia it was already spring . Her ride with her father to the Negro school building , some miles from the town , past Georgia peach orchards , past cotton lands , past little unpainted cabins , scattered so thickly over the land ... the usual cropper 's portion was ten acres ... past long stretches of worn-out lands ... the ride during which she did so much thinking about her father in relation to his new wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of men and a possible permanent relation to some man of her own  --  her ride took place before the two men of the town , one very young , one almost old , became interested in her . Men with their mules were plowing the fields . There were brown men and white men , the brutalized ignorant poor whites of the South . Not all of the woods in that country were pine woods . There were stretches of lowland along a river road they traveled that day . At places red newly plowed landP141seemed to go right up the side of a slope into the dark wood . A brown man , driving a team of mules , went right up a slope into a wood . His mules disappeared in the wood . They turned in there and came out . Single pine trees seemed to run out from the mass of trees as though to dance on the fresh newly plowed land . At the river 's edge , below the road along which they drove , Ethel 's father now quite lost in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale she kept going by askingoccasional questions  --  at the river 's edge swamp maples grew . A little earlier the leaves of the swamp maples had been blood-red but they were now turning green . The dogwoodwas coming into bloom . It gleamed white against the green of the new growth . The peach orchards were almost ready to bloom , soon they would burst forth in a mad riot of bloom . Just at the river 's edge , cypress grew . You could see the knees ' sticking up out of the brown slack water and out of the red mud at the edge of the river . It was spring . You felt spring in the air . Ethel kept glancing at her father . She was half angry with him . She had to keep him going , keep his mind occupied with thoughts of his boyhood . " What 's the use ? ... he will never know , can never know why his Blanche and I hate each other , why at the same time we want to help each other . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpent 's eyes . They were blue and as thoughts came and went they sometimes seemed to grow green . They were really gray when she felt cold , gray when warmth came into her . The intensity broke . She wanted to chuck it . " I should take him into my arms , as though he were still the boy he is talking about , " she thought . No doubt his first wife , Ethel 's mother , often did that . There might be a man , who was still a boy , as her father was , who nevertheless knew he was a boy . " I could perhaps make a go of it with such a one , " she thought . Hatred grew in her . It was as a bright-green new spring plant in her that day . The woman Blanche knew she hadp142hatred in her . That was why the two women could both hate and respect each other . If her father had only known a bit more than he did know , than he could ever know . " Why could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to have another wife , if he felt he needed one ? ... " She felt vaguely her father 's hunger for a son . .. the World War had taken his last one . .. and yet he could go on , like the eternal child he was , believing the World War justified . he had been one of the leaders in his section , whooping it up for the war , helping to sell Liberty Bonds ... she remembered a silly speech she had once , before her mother 's death , after the son had enlisted , heard her father make . He spoke of the war as it healing thing . " It will bind up old wounds here in our own country , between the North and the South , " he said that time ... Ethel sitting beside her own mother listening ... the mother went a little pale ... women surely have to stand for a lot of nonsense front their men ... Ethel felt it was rather absurd , the determination of the male about sons ... a vanity that went on aml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so terribly important .... " Why , in God 's sweet name , if he wanted another son , did he pick out Blanche ? " " What man would want to be Blanche 's son ? " It was all a part of the immaturity of men a woman got so tired of . Now Blanche was tired of it . " Such damn children , " Ethel thought . Her father was sixty-five . Her mind leaped to something else . " What do women give a damn whether or not the man who can do to them what they want done is good or not ? " She was getting into the habit of swearing , even in her thought . Perhaps she had caught that from Blanche . She thought she had one thing on Blanche . She was less tired . She was n't tired at all . She thought , sometimes , when she was in the mood she was in that day . . . " I 'm strong , " she thought . " I could hurt a lot of men before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with Blanche . " I could fix her , " she thought . " This business of her letting herself go , dirty and shabby-looking as she is ... It may be a way of keeping him off . .. It would n't be my way . " " I could take her , make her live a little . I wonder if she wants me to . I guess she does . I guess that is what she is up to . " Ethel sat in the car beside her father smiling , a hard queer smile . Once her father caught a glimpse of it . It frightened him . She could still smile softly . She knew that . There he was , the man , her father , perplexed by the two women he had got into his house , his wife and his daughter , wanting to ask his daughter , " What 's wrong ? " Not daringto ask . " There are things going on about me I ca n't under-stand . " " Yes , boy . You are right about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three times during the drive that day , a flush came to the judge 's cheeks . He wanted to lay down certain rules . He wanted to be a law-maker . " Be kind to me and others . Be honorable . Be fair . " " Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . " Ethel 's father used to put his foot down hard sometimes when she was a little girl at home . At that time she was half a tom-boy , she was eager , easily excited . At one time she had a mad desire to play with all the bad little boys of town . She knew which the bad ones were . You could tell them , the bold ones . They would do things to you , perhaps , that kind . There was all the terrible talk about pure spotless white womanhood in the South . Better to be a nigger girl . " For God 's sake , come here . Put some spots on me . Do n't listen to anything I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Do it . Do it . " P144There must have been some sense in the strange , halfmadmen of Russia , before the revolution , who went about urging people to commit sin . " Make God happy . Give Him a lot to forgive . " Some of the bad little white boys of Langdon , Georgia , might have done it . One or two had almost got the chance with Ethel . There was one bad little boy who had come close to her in a barn , another at night in a field , in the field near her father 's house , where he kept his cow . She herself had crept out at night to that one . He had told her that afternooncoming home from school to creep out there , in the early evening , just after dark , to the field , and although she had trembled with fright , she had gone . There had been such a strange , half-frightened eager daring look in his young boy 's eyes . She had got ' out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn him . I might have learned something . " There were memories like that in Blanche too . Of course . She being puzzled and puzzled a long , long time , through girlhood , through early womanhood , as Ethel had been , Blanche taking Ethel 's father at last , going after him and getting him . That good , good old boy . 0 Lord ! Ethel Long was hard , she was glistening , riding with her father as he went one day to pay a visit to a Negro school teacher who had been indiscreet , riding with him and thinking . Not seeing , on that day , the dogwood shining against the green by a river 's edge , not seeing white men and brown men driving mules , plowing the Southern land for another cotton crop . White cotton . Sweet purity . Her father had come into the field that night and had found her there . She stood in the field trembling . There was a moon . There was too much moon . He did n't see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she crept out of the house . She had seen him coming . It would be odd if he were also shy and frightened as she was . What chances people take ! Men and women , boys and girls , approaching each other thus ... seeking some obscureHeaven , for the moment . " Now ! Now ! We may at least have this moment 's taste of it ... if it be Heaven . " So blunderingly we go . It is better to go blunderingly than not to go . " Perhaps the boy felt that . He had determination . He ran toward her and grabbed at her . He tore her dress at the neck . She trembled . He was of the right sort . She had picked one of the right sort . Her father had n't seen the boy . When the father came out at the door of the Long house that night , his heavy feet making a loud sound on wooden steps , the boy dropped to the ground and crawled toward a fence . There were some bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her father , seeing nothing , was yet suspicious . He was convinced there had been something wrong , something to him terrible . Were all men , even good men , like Ethel 's father , closer to animals than they ever let themselvesknow ? It would be nicer if they did let themselves know . If men dared let themselves know women might live more freely , they might lead sweeter lives . " In the present world of men there is too much thought and not enough thought . Men want courage and , not having it , they make women too much afraid , " Ethel thought . " But why was I given a mind ? I am too much woman and not enough woman . " That night in the field her father had n't seen the boy . If there had n't been a moon she might have got away from her father and followed the boy into . the bushes . There was too much moon . Her father sensed something . " Come here , " he said to her harshly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't move . She was n't afraid of him thatP146night . She hated him . " Come here , " he kept saying , striding across the field toward her . At that time her father was n't the meek thing he became after he got Blanche . He had a woman then , Ethel 's mother , who was perhaps even afraid of him . She never crossed him . Was she afraid or was she merely patient ? It would be nice to know . It would be nice to know whether it had always to be so , the woman either dominating the man or the man the woman . The name of the vulgar little boy she had arranged to meet that night was Ernest and although the father had not seen him on that night , several days later he suddenly said to her , " Do you know a boy named Ernest White ? " " No , " she lied . " I want you to stay away from him . Do n't you dare have a thing to do with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little boys of the town , the bad bold ones and the good gentle ones . Ethel , even as a child , had sharp senses . She knew then , or if not then later , that dogs , when there was a female dog that had desires . . . the male dog threw his nose into the air . He stood alert , at attention . There was a female dog wanting , perhaps miles away . Ile ran . Many dogs ran . They gathered in packs , fighting and growling at each other . After that night in the field Ethel was malicious . She cried and swore that her father had torn her dress . " He attackedme . I was n't doing anything . He tore my dress . He hurt me . " " You were up to something , creeping out there like that . What were you up to ? " " Nothing . " She kept crying . She went sobbing into the house . Suddenlyher father , that good man , had begun talking about his honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man . " " I 'd rather see a daughter of mine in her grave than not have her be a good girl . " " But what is a good girl ? " Ethel 's mother had remained silent . She had gone a littleP147white , listening to the father talking to the daughter , but she had said nothing . Perhaps she had thought , " That is the way we have to begin . We have to begin to understand men , what they are like . " Ethel 's mother was a good woman . Not the child , listening to a father 's talk about his honor , but the woman the child became , admired and loved the mother . " We women have to learn , too . " Sometime there might be a good life on the earth but the time was a long , long way off . It impliedsome new kind of understanding between men and women , an understanding grown more general among all men and all women , a sense of the oneness of human beings not realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " Ethel thought that day after she had come back to Langdon to be the librarianthere . She doubted her capacity to be the thing she was thinking of as she rode in the car with her father and afterwards as she sat in the car before a little Negro school , half buried in pine woods . Her father had gone into the school to find out whether or not a woman in there , a Negro woman , had been misbehaving . She wondered whether or not he could ask her , brutally , directly . " Perhaps he can . She is a Negro woman , " Ethel , thought.  |p148THERE  was a scene in Ethel 's mind . It came into her mind after her father had visited the Negro school and they were driving homeward in the warin early spring sunlight , riding over the red Georgia roads , riding past fields newly plowed . She saw little enough of the fields and did not ask her father how he had come out with the Negro woman iii the school . The woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icr father had gone in there , into the little Negro school while she remained the car outside . He would have got the teacher to one side . l i e could n't ask her directly , even though she were a Negro woman . " They say .... Is it true ? " The judge was always getting himself into situations . He was presumed to know a lot about handling people . Ethel smiled . She was living in the past . On the ride homeward she got her father back to the subject of his own boyhood . He had hoped to have a serious talk with her , to find out from her , if he could , what was wrong in his own house , but he did n't succeed . Men were plowing in red fields . Red roads went winding over low Georgia hills . A river , with trees growing along its banks and with white dogwood looking out from amid bright new green leaves , followed the road . Her father wanted to ask her , " What 's up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Blanche up to ? " " So , you want to know ? " " Yrs . Tell me . "   " The devil I will . Find out for yourself . You men are so smart . Find out for yourself . " A queer old enmity between men and women . Where did it begin ? Was it necessary ? Would it always go on ? At one moment that day Ethel wanted to be as her mother had been , patient and kindly with her father , while , in the next moment ... " If you were my man ... " Her mind occupied itself with the drama of her own life , in Chicago , thinking of it , now that it was a thing of the past , trying to understand it . There was one particular adventure . It had happened , at the end of her days as a student there . One evening she had gone to dine with a man . At that time  --  it was after her father 's second marriage , when she had been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme to make her the librarian of the new library at Langdon had already been hatched in Blanche 's mind and , falling in with it , Ethel had managed to get a job in the Chicago Public Library . . . . She went to a library school . Anotheryoung woman , also working at the library , had gone to dine with Ethel and a certain man , and with a man of her own . She was a small rather plump woman , young and inexperiencedin life , whose people  --  very respectable people as were Ethel 's people in Langdon  --  lived in a Chicago suburb . The two women were going out to make a night of it , to achieve an adventure , and the men they were with were married men . It had just come about . It had been Ethel who had arranged it . She could not help wondering how much the other woman knew , how innocent she was . There was the man Ethel was to spend the evening with . He was a queer one all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him one evening at a party . He had interested her . In her curiosity about him there was something of Ethel , the girlchildin the field waiting for the bad little small-town boy . She was at a literary party when she first met the manp150and there were a number of men and women present who were prominent in the Chicago literary world . For one , there was Edgar Lee Masters , and Carl Sandburg , the famous Chicago poet , also came . There were a lot of younger writers and some painters . A woman , older than Ethel , who also worked in the public library , had taken Ethel . The party was held in a large . apartment , near the lake , over on the North Side . A woman who wrote poetry and who had married a rich man gave the party . There were several large rooms filled with people . It was easy enough to tell which were the famous ones. , The others gathered about , asking questions and listening . The famous ones were nearly all nun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stank . People kept arriving and presently the large rooms were filled with people . So this was the higher life , the cultural life . At the party , Ethel , who was at once forgotten by the woman who had brought her , had wandered rather aimlessly about . She saw several people sitting apart in a small room . They were obviously unknown people like herself and she went in among them and sat down . After all , she could n't help thinking , " I 'm the best-dressed woman here . " She had pride in that fact . There were women present wearing more expensive gowns but almost without exception they had missed something . She knew that . She had kept her eyes open since she had come into the apartment . " What a lot of frumps there are among the literary ladies , " she thought . That night , although she was out of it , not being known as a writer or painter , being a mere employee in the Chicago Public Library , a student , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , it was all right . People kept coming , crowding into the apartment . They were being addressed by their given names . " Hello , Carl . " " Why , Jim , here you are . " " Hello , Sarah . " The little room into which Ethel had gotP151faced a hallway by which people entered a larger room , crowded with people . The smaller room began also to fill . She had , however , got into a little side-current out of the main stream . She watched and listened . A woman seated near her was informing a friend , " There 's Mrs. Will Brownlee . She writes poetry . She has had poems in Scribner 's and in Harper 's and in a lot of other magazines . She is to publish a book soon . The tall woman with red hair is a sculptress . The little frumpy-looking one writes a column of literary criticism for one of the Chicago dailies . " There were the women and the men . Most of the people at the party were evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't yet risen to national fame , they had hopes . There was something a bit queer about the position of such people , the writers , painters , sculptors and musicians in American life . Ethel sensed the position of such people , particularly in Chicago , and was amused and puzzled . So many people wanted to be writers . Why ? The writers were always writing books that were reviewed in the newspapers . There was a little flare of enthusiasm or of condemnation that died very quickly . There was really very little intellectual life . The great city sprawled itself out . Distances within the city were immense . For the people who were on the inside , in the intellectual circles of the city , there was both admirationand contempt . They were in a great commercial city , lost in it . It was an undisciplined city , magnificent but unformed . It was a changing city , always growing , changing , always getting bigger . On the side of the city , facing Lake Michigan , there was a street on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a street lined with great office buildings and hotels , the lake on one side and there was a long narrow park . It was a wind-blown street , a glorious street . Some oneP152had told Ethel that it was the most magnificent street in America and she believed it . On many days it was a sunwashed , a wind-swept street . A river of motors flowed along . There were smart shops and great hotels , and smartly dressed people walked up and down . Ethel loved the street . She liked to put on a smart dress and walk there . Beyond this street , to the west , there was a network of dark tunnel-like streets , not taking queer and unexpected turns as in New York , Boston , Baltimore and other older American cities , cities which Ethel had visited when she had taken a trip for just that purpose , but streets laid out in a grill , going straight away to the west , going north and south . Ethel in doing her work had to go out west , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after she had finished her university life and was studying to be a librarian , in a small room on lower Michigan Avenue , below the Loop , and every day walked up Michigan Avenue to Madison where she took her car . On the evening when she went to the party and , there met the man with whom she afterwards went to dine , and with whom she later had an adventure that had a deep influenceupon her outlook on life , she was in a period of revolt . She was always having such periods . They came and went , and after she had passed through one of them she was rather amused at herself . The truth was that she had been in revolt ever since she came to Chicago . There she was , a tall straight figure of a woman , a triflemannish . She might so easily grow more or less mannish . Shehad been in the university for four years and , when not inthe university , had been working in the city or had been athome . Her father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his father and his first marriage hadbrought him some and he owned Southern farm lands butthe land did not bring in much income . His salary wasn'tlarge and he had , besides Ethel , other children to take care of . Ethel was in one of her periods of revolt against men . P153At the literary party that night , as she sat rather to one side . not feeling neglected ... she knew only the older woman who had brought her to the party . . . why should that woman bother about her , having got her in there ... " having done me that great favor , " she thought . . . at the party she realized also that she might long since have had a man of her own , even an intellectual man . There had been a man out at the university , a young instructor , who also wrote and published poetry , an eager intense young man who had courted her . What a queer performancehis courtship had been ! She had cared nothing for him , but she had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had begun asking her if he could come to see her and if he could take her places and then he had begun helping her with her work . The help had been needed . Ethel had cared little enough about some of her studies . They were a bother to her . You had to select a certain number of studies . The examinations at the university were stiff . If you got behind , you were thrown out . If she were thrown out , her father would be angry and she would have to return to Langdon , Georgia , to live . The young instructor was a help . " Look here , " he said , when there was to be an examination , " these will be about the sort of questions the man will ask . " He knew . He prepared answers . " You answer them in this way . You 'll get through all right . " Before an examination he worked with her for hours . What a joke the four years at the university had been ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as herself ! It was a thing her father had wanted her to do . He had made sacrifices , had gone without things and had saved money to enable her to do it . She did not want specially to be educated , an intellectual woman . More than anything else , she thought she would have liked being a rich woman . " God , " she thought , " if I only had a lot of money . " - She had an idea ... it might very well be absurd ... sheP154might have got it from novel reading . .. there seemed to be rather a fixed idea in most Americans that happiness was to be got through wealth . .. there might be a life in which she could really function . There might be , for a woman like herself , with a certain undoubted swank , a place . She even dreamed sometimes , her dreams influenced by her reading , of a kind of glorious life . In a book about English life she read of a certain Lady Blessington , in Peel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young girl . Lady Blessington began life as the ( laughter of an obscure Irishmanwho married her off to a rich and disagreeable man . Then the miracle . She was seen by Lord Blessington , who was very rich , an English nobleman . There she was , a real beauty , and no doubt , like lithe ! , a woman of style , hidden away like that . The noble Englishman took her to England , got her a divorce and married her . They set off for Italy accompanied by a young French nobleman who became Lady Blessington 's lover . I I er noble lord did n't seem to mind . The young man was brilliant . What the old lord wanted no doubt was some real decoration to his own life . She gave him that . The great difficulty with Ethel was that she was not quite poor . " I 'm middle class , " she thought . She had picked up that word somewhere , perhaps from her admirer , the collegeinstructor . His name was l larold Grey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost in the crowd at an American university , later lost in the Chicago crowds . She was a woman always wanting clothes , wanting jewels to wear , wanting to ride in a fine automobile . No doubt all women were like that , although a good many would never admit it . That was because they knew they had n't a chance . She took Vogue and other women 's magazines , filled with pictures of the latest Paris gowns , gowns draped over the bodies of tall slender women , much like herself . There were pictures of country houses , people driving up to the doors of country houses in veryp155elegant-looking automobiles ... perhaps in the advertising pages of the magazines . How clean and nice and first-class everything seemed ! In the pictures she saw in the magazines , lying alone sometimes in her bed in a little room ... it being Sunday morning . .. pictures meaning to suggest a kind of life quite possible to all Americans ... that is to say , if they were real Americans , not foreign trash ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains enough to make money .... " God , but I 'd like to marry a rich man , " Ethel thought . " If I had the chance . I would n't give a damn what he was . " She did n't quite mean that . She was always getting into debt , having to scheme and scheme to get the clothes she thought she needed . " I have n't a thing to cover my nakedness , " she said sometimes to other women she met at the university . She had even had to bother to learn to sew and was always having to think about money . It had resulted in her always living in rather shabby quarters , doing without many simple little luxuries other women had . She did so much want to make a swank appearance before the world and in the university , while she was a student . She was a good deal admired . None of the other women students ever got very close to her . There had been two or three . .. rather soft little femininethings they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wrote little notes and sent flowers to her room . She had a dim notion what they meant . " Not for me , " she told herself . There were the magazines she saw , talk she heard , books she read . Out of occasional fits of boredom she had become a novel reader and that had been mistaken for an interest in literature . In the summer , when she went home to Langdon she took a dozen novels with her . Her reading had put the idea of her being the town librarian into Blanche 's head . There were these pictures of people , always on glorious summer days , in places to which only the rich went . There was the sea to be seen in the distance and a golf course by the sea . There were handsomely dressed young men walking about . " God , I might have been born into such a life . " It was always spring or summer in the pictures or , if winter came , tall women in expensive furs were engaged in winter sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a born Southerner , she had few illusions about life in the American South . " It 's shabby , " she thought . Chicago people she met asked her about Southernlife . " Is n't there great charm to your life down there ? I have always heard about the charm of life in the South . " " Charm , hell ! " Ethel did not say that , although she thought it . " There 's no use making yourself unnecessarily unpopular , " she thought . The life might be quite charming to some people ... people of a certain sort ... not fools by any means , she knew that ... she thought her own mother had found life in the South , with her lawyer husband , who understood so little ... so full he was of his middle-class virtues , believing in his own honesty of mind , his honor , his deeply religious nature . .. her mother had managed not to be unhappy . Her mother would have got some of the charm of Southernlife , people of the North like so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets . . . Negroes usually pretty slick , telling lies , working the whites ... the long hot dull Southern summer days . Her mother had lived out her life , sunk deep in that life . Ethel and her mother had never really talked . There always had been something , a kind of understanding , as later between her and the blonde step-mother . Ethel 's hatred grew and grew . Was it man hatred ? It might well be that . " They are such self-satisfied damn stick-in-the-muds , " she thought . As for her being specially interested in books , being an intellectual , it was a joke . A lot of the other women she met when she had begun studying to be a librarian seemed in terested , even absorbed.  |p157No  doubt the people who wrote books thought they were up to something . Some of them really were . Her own favorite author was the Irishman , George Moore . " Writers should create , for those of us whose lives are drab , lives not so drab , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memoirs of My Dead Life . Love should be like that , she thought . There were these lovers of Moore 's at the inn at Orelay , their going out at night into the little French provincial town to find the pajamas , the shop-keeper , the room in the inn that was such a disappointment and then the delightful room they later found . No bothering about each other 's souls , about sin and the consequences of sin . The writer had liked fine lingerie on his ladies ; he liked soft delicate clinging gowns slipping gently off the female form . Such lingerie imparted to the women who wore it something of its own elegance , its own rich softness and firmness . The whole matter of earthiness , in most of the books Ethel read , was , she thought , too much overdone . Who wanted it ? It would be better to be a high-class whore . If a woman could only pick her men , that would n't be so bad . Ethel thought that more women than men would ever guess had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , fools . " They are children wanting to be nursed through life , " she thought . In a Chicago newspaper one day she saw the pictureand read the account of the adventures of a woman highwayman , and her heart jumped . She imagined herself walking into a bank and holding it up , getting thereby , in a few minutes , thousands of dollars . " If there was a way of meeting a really first-class highwayman and he 'd fall for me , I 'd fall for him , all right , " she thought . In Ethel 's time , when she , by a mere chance , she thought , got herself connected , always on the outer edge , of course , with the literary world , a great many of the writers who were getting most attention just then ... not the really popular ones , the ones she really liked , the ones who had sense enough to write only of the lives of the rich , and the successful ... the only really in- teresting lives ... a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big names , Theodore Dreiser , Sinclair Lewis and others , concerned themselves with such low-grade people . " Damn them , they write of people just like myself , caught as I am . " Or they tell stories of working people and their lives ... or little farmers on poor little farms in Ohio , Indiana or Iowa , people driving about in Fords , a hired man , in love with some hired girl , going into the woods with her , her sadness and fright afterwards when she discovers she is that way . What difference slid it all make ? " I can imagine just how such a hired man would smell , " she thought . After she had finished at the university and had got a job at a branch of the Chicago public library ... it was far out on the West Side ... handing out dirty soiled books to dirty soiled people day after day ... having to be cheerful about it and act as though you liked it ... such tired weary faces most of the working people had ... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or young boys . The boys liked to read about crime or about outlaws or cowboys in some vague place known as the " Far West . " Ethel did n't blame them . She had to ride home at night on a street car . Rainy nights came . The car ran past the grim walls of factories . There were workingmen crowding into the car . How black and dismal seemed the city streets under the street lights , seen through the car windows , and how far , far away were the people of the advertising pictures seen in Vogue , the people with country houses , the sea at the door , the spreading lawns with great avenues of shade trees , those who went , richly gowned , in expensive cars to dine at some big hotel . Some of the workingmen in the car must have been in the same clothes day after day , even month after month . The air was heavy with dampness . The car reeked . Ethel sat grimly in the car and sometimes grew pale . A workingman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofp159them dared sit very close . They felt dimly that she must belong to some outside world , far removed from their world . " Who 's the dame ? How did she get here , into this part of town ? " they asked themselves . Even the poorest paid workingmanhad , at some time in his life , walked in certain downtownChicago streets , even on Michigan Avenue . He had walked , feeling perhaps awkward and out of place , past the entrances to great hotels . He had seen such women as Ethel seemed , coming out of such places . The pictures they had in their minds of the lives led by the rich and the successful were somewhat different from the picture in Ethel 's mind . An older Chicago had expressed that . There had been great saloons , all built of marble , with silver dollars set in the floor . A workingman told another of a certain Chicago house of prostitution he had heard of . A friend had been there once . " You sank in silken carpets to your knees . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel 's picture was n't that . She wanted elegance , style , a world of color and of movement . A passage read in a book , that afternoon rang in her head . It described a house in London .... " One passed through a drawing-room in gold and ruby , filled with beautiful amber vases which had belonged to the Empress Josephine , to enter the long narrow library with its white walls on which mirrors alternated with panels of richly bound books . Through the tall window at the end could be seen the trees of Hyde Park . Round the room were sofas , ottomans , tables of enamel , covered with bibelots , and in a yellow satin fauteuil Lady Marrow , dressed in a gown ofblue satin , cut extremely low .... " " The American writers , who call themselves real writers , writing about this kind of people , " Ethel thought , looking16o BEYOND DESIREp160up and down the street car , her eyes surveying a street car filled with Chicago factory hands , homeward bound as she was after a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreary little crowded apartments . .. squalling dirty little children playing on the floor ... herself alas going to a place not so much better ... no money in her pockets half the time ... she had often to ( line at cheap little cafeterias ... herself having to skimp and grub to get a little money ... the writers concerning themselves with such lives , the loves , the hopes of such people . Not that she hated them , the workingmen and the workingwomenshe saw in Chicago . She tried not to have them exist for her . They were like the white people of the mill village at the edge of her home town of Langdon , they were as the Negroes had always been to the people of the South , that is to say , at any rate as the field Negroes had been . She did in a way have to read the books of the writers who wrote of such people . She had to keep up . People were always asking questions . After all , she was planning to be a librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through to the end . " Well , " she said , putting it down , " what of it ? What does it matter about such people ? " As for the men who had interested themselves directly in Ethel , who had thought they wanted her . The instructor out at the university , Harold Grey , would do as an example . He wrote letters . That seemed to be his passion . Several men with whom she had had passing flirtationshad been of that sort . They were all intellectuals . She had something in her attractive , apparently to that sort , and yet , when she got one , she hated him . They were always trying to delve into her soul or they were fussing about with their own souls . Harold Grey was just the type . He tried top161psychoanalyze her and had rather watery blue eyes , hidden behind thick glasses , rather thin hair carefully combed , narrowshoulders , not too strong legs . He went absent-mindedly along the street , hurrying along . He always had books under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine herselfliving with Harold . The truth was , probably , that she was on the look-out for a particular kind of man . It might even be all nonsense about her wanting fine clothes and a certain elegant position in life . Being one who did not warm easily to others , she was a good deal alone , was alone often even in the presence of others . Her mind was always leaping forward . There was in her a touch of the masculine , meaning only , in her case , a kind of boldness , not very womanly , quick flights of fancy . She could laugh at herself . She was thankful for that . She saw Harold Grey hurrying along the street . He had a room near the university , and to get to his classes did not need to go through the street where , during her university days , she had a room but , after he had begun paying attention to her , he often did . " It 's funny , his falling for me , " she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a bit more of a man , if he were a tough brow-beating man , or big , an athlete or something of that sort ... or if he were rich . " There was something very meek and hopeful and at the same time boyishly sad about Harold . He was always delving about among the poets , finding little verses for her . Or he read nature books . He was in the philosophy departmentat the university but said to her that he really had wanted to be a naturalist . He brought her a book by a man named Fabre , something about caterpillars . They , the caterpillars , went creeping along the ground or they ate the leaves of a tree . " Let them , " Ethel thought . She grew angry . " Damn . They are n't my trees . Let them strip the trees bare . " For a time she had hung onto the little instructor . He had n't much money and was working for his Ph.D . She went 162 BEYOND DESIREP162for walks with him . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses of professors . She let him hire a taxi . He took her , sometimes in the evening , for long drives . They went west and south . It would be so and so many dollarsand dimes for every hour they were out together . " I 'm not giving him much for his money , " she thought . " I wonder if he would have the nerve to try to collect if he knew how easy I would be for the right sort of man . " She made the drives as long as possible , " Let 's go down this road , " dragging the time out . " he could live a week on what I am making him blow in , " she thought . She let him buy books for her she did not want to read . A man , perhaps sitting all day and watching the actions of caterpillars or ants or even clung beetles , clay after day , month after month  --  that was what he admired . " If he really wants me he 'd better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he were able . I guess that is what I need . " Ridiculous moments remembered . Once on Sunday she was with him on a long drive in a hired car . They went to a place called Palos Park . He needed to do something . It began to bother him . " Really now , " she asked herself that day , " why have I such contempt for him ? " He was trying hard to be nice to her . He was always writing her letters . In the letters he was much bolder than when he was with her . He wanted to stop by a wood , at the side of the road . He needed to . He moved nervously about on the car seat . " He must really be suffering terribly , " she thought . She was pleased . Maliciousness had taken possession of her . " Why does n't he say what he wants ? " If it was a matter of his being too shy to use certain words surely there was some way he could let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to go into the woods alone . Nature calls . " He was so damned hot on nature . . . bringing her books about caterpillars and dung beetles . Even when he was thatP163way that day , shifting nervously about on the seat , he tried to pass it off as enthusiasm for nature . He wiggled and squirmed . " Look , " he cried . He pointed out a tree growing beside the road . " Is n't it magnificent ? " " You are rather magnificent yourself , " she thought . It was a day of light floating clouds and he called attention to them . " They look like camels crossing a desert . " " You would like to be alone on a desert yourself , " she thought . All he needed was a lonely desert or a tree between himself and her . It was his way , talking as he did about nature , going on and on about it , about trees and fields and rivers and flowers . And ants and caterpillars ... And then being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him suffer . Two or three times he almost escaped . She got out of the car with him and they walked in a wood . He pretended to see something at a distance , off among the trees . " You wait here , " he said , but she ran after him . " I want to see , too , " she said . The joke of it was that the man who was driving the car that day , the chauffeur .. . he was rather of the tough city type .. . he chewed tobacco and spat .... He had a little snub nose that looked as though it had been broken in a fight and there was a scar on his cheek , as though from a knife cut . He knew what was going on . He knew Ethel knew that he knew . Ethel had finally let the instructor get away . She turned and walked away along a path toward the car , having tired of the game . Harold would wait a few minutes before joiningher . Very likely he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower to pluck ... To pretend that was what he was up to , trying to find a flower for her . The joke was that the chauffeur knew . He might have been Irish . When she got to where the car waited beside the road , he had got out of his driver 's seat and wasi standing there . " Did you let him get lost ? " he asked . He knew she knew what he meant . He spat on the ground and grinned as she got into the car. *ETHEL was at the literary party in Chicago . Men and women went about smoking cigarettes . There was a little chattering stream of talk . People disappeared into the kitchen of the apartment . Cocktails were being served out there . Ethel sat in the little room off the hallway and a man came to her . He had spotted her , picked her out . There was an empty chair beside her and the came and sat down . He was direct . " There does n't seem to lie any one doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " It does n't mean anything to you . No , I do not write novels or essays . I do n't paint or scull ) . I 'm no poet . " He laughed . Ile was a new sort to Ethel . I le looked at her boldly . His eyes were grayish blue , cold eyes as were her own at times . " At least , " she thought , " he 's a bold one . " He had marked her down . " You 'll do for me , " he had perhaps thought . He was looking for a woman to entertain him . He was at the old game . A man wanted to talk about himself . He wanted a woman to listen , to be impressed , to seem absorbed as he spoke of himself . It was a man 's game but women were no better . The woman wanted to be admired . She wanted beauty of person and she wanted a man aware of her beauty . " I can stand for almost any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . " Look here , " the man she saw at the party , the man named Fred Wells said , " you are n't one of these , are you ? " He made a quick movement with his hand toward the others sitting in the small room and toward those in the large room near by . " I 'll bet you are n't . You do n't look like that , " he saidp165smiling . " Not that I 've anything against these people , particularlythe male ones . They are people of distinction , I suppose , at least some of them are . " The man laughed . He was alive like a fox terrier . " I myself pulled some strings to get here , " he said , laughing . " I do n't really belong . What about you ? Do you sculp ? A lot of women do . They take it out that way . I bet you do n't . " He was a man of perhaps thirty-five , very slender and alive . He kept smiling but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other across his sharp face . He had very clear-cut features , such features as might have been seen in a cigarette or clothing advertisement . For some reason he made Ethel think of a fine , highly bred dog . An advertisement . . . " the best dressed man at Princeton " . . . " the man at Harvard , most likely to succeed in life , selected by his class . " He had been to a good tailor . His clothes were not showy . They were without a doubt faultlessly correct . He leaned over to whisper to Ethel , putting his face quite close to hers . " I did n't think you were one of these , ' ; he said . She had told him nothing of herself . It was evident that there was in him a kind of sharp antagonism to the celebrities at the party . " Look at them . They think they are great shucks , now do n't they ? " Damn their eyes . Strutting about here , the men celebritiesbeing fawned on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not say that at once . It was implied in his manner . He had devoted the evening to her , taking her about and introducing her to the celebrities . He seemed to know them all . He took things for granted . " Here Carl , come here , " he commanded . That was a command to Carl Sandburg , a large broad-shouldered man with gray hair . There was something in Fred Wells ' manner . He was impressing Ethel . " See , I call him by his first name . I say , come here , '  |p166and  he comes . " He called various men to him , Ben and Joe and Frank . " I want you to meet this woman . " " She 's Southern , " he said . He had caught that from Ethel 's speech . " She 's the best-looking woman here . You do n't need to worry . She is n't any kind of an artist . She wo n't be asking any favors of you . " He grew familiar and confidential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to any little book of poems , nothing of that sort . " " I 'm not in this game , " he said aside to Ethel , " and yet I am too . " I Ic had taken her into the kitchen of the apartment and had got her a cocktail . He lit a cigarette for her . They stood a little to one side , out of the jam of people , Ethel amused . Ile explained to her what he was , still smiling . " I suppose I 'm the lowest of human beings , " he said cheerfully , but as he said it he smiled blandly . He wore a tiny little black mustache and , as he talked , kept stroking it . His talk was oddly like the harking of a little dog in a road , a dog barking determinedly at an automobile in a road , at an automobile that has passed around a turn in the road . He was a man who made his money in the patentmedicinebusiness and explained it all to Ethel at a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a woman of family , being Southern . Well , I 'm not . I 've noticed that almost all Southerners have a family . I 'm from Iowa . " He was obviously a man who lived by his contempt . He had spoken of Ethel 's being Southern with contempt in his voice , contempt that he was careful to keep controlled , as though to say  --  laughing --  --  " Do n't try to put it over me because you are Southern . " That game wo n't go with me . " But see . I laugh . I am not serious . " Ta ! Ta ! " " I wonder if he is like myself , " Ethel thought . " I wonder if I am that way . "  |p167There  are certain people . You do not really like them . You stay , near them . They teach you things . It was as though he had come to the party only to find her and , having found her , was satisfied . At once , having met her , he wanted to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's get out of here . Here we shall have to struggle to get drinks . There 's no place to sit . We ca n't talk . We are of no importancehere . " He wanted to be somewhere , in an atmosphere where he could seem more important to himself . " Let 's go on downtown to one of the big hotels . We can dine there . I 'll manage about the drinks . Watch me . " He kept smiling . Ethel did n't care . She had a queer notion about the man , had it from the moment when he had first come to her . There was a touch of Mephistopheles . She was amus-d . " If that is what he is , I 'll find out about him , " she thought . She went with him to get her wraps and getting a cab they went to a big downtown restaurant where he found for her a seat in a quiet corner . He did manage about drinks . A bottle was brought . He seemed to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to talk about myself . Do you mind ? " She said she did n't . He had been born in a countyscattown in Iowa . His father , he explained , was in politics out there and had got to be the county treasurer . After all the man had a story of his own . He was givingEthel his background . In Iowa , where he had spent his boyhood , everything had gone all right for a long time , but then his father had used county funds for some sort of speculation of his own and had got caught . There had come a period of depression . Stocks his father had bought on margin had gone tumbling down . He was caught short . That , Ethel gathered , was at about the time Fred Wells was through high school . " I did n't spend any time moping about , " he said , proudly and quickly . " I came to Chicago . "  | He explained that he was smart . " I 'm a realist , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm smart . I 'm as smart as hell . " I 'll bet I 'm smart enough to see through you , " he said to Ethel . " I know what you are . You are a dissatisfied woman . " He smiled saying that . Ethel had n't liked him . She had been amused and interested . There was even a way in which she did like him . At least he was a relief after some of the men she had met in Chicago . They kept drinking as the man talked and as the dinner he had ordered was served , and Ethel liked drinking , althoughdrink did not affect her much . Drinking was a relief . It made her daring , although getting drunk was n't any fun . She had got drunk just once and when she did it she was alone . That had been on a night when she was still at the universityand just before an examination . Harold Grey had been helping her . IIe had left her and she went to her room . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled into bed and was ill . The whisky did not make her drunk . It seemed to excite her nerves , make her mind peculiarly cold and clear . The illness came after that . " I wo n't do that again , " she told herself that time . In the restaurant Fred Wells continued to explain himself . He seemed to feel it necessary to explain his presence at the literary party , as though to say , " I 'm not one of them . I do n't want to be . " " There is no danger of my thinking so , " Ethel thought . She did not say so . He had come to Chicago , as a young man just out of school , and , after a time , had begun cultivating the artistic and literary crowd . There was no doubt it gave a man , such a man as himself , a certain standing , knowing such people . He bought them dinners . He went about with them . Life is a game . Knowing such people is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a collector of first editions . " It 's a good scheme , " he told Ethel . " It seems to put you in a certain class and , besides , if you are shrewd , you can make money at it , that is to say , there 's no reason , if you watch your step , why you should lose money . " So he had got in with the literary crowd . They were , he thought , childish , egotistical , sensitive . They amused a man . Most of the women , he thought , were rather soft , they were soft-headed . He kept smiling and stroking his mustache . He had gone in for first editions and had already a fine collection . " I 'll take you to see them , " he said . " They are in my apartment , but my wife is out of town . Of course , I do n't expect you to go there with me to-night . " I know you 're not a fool . " " I am not such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily , that you can be plucked , like a ripe apple from a tree , " was what he had thought . He proposed a party . Ethel could get another woman and he would get another man . It would make a nice small party . They would have dinner at a restaurant and afterwardsgo to his apartment to see his books . " You are n't squeamish , are you ? " he asked . " You know , there will be another woman and another man there . " My wife will be out of town for a month yet . " " No , " Ethel had said . He had spent all of that first evening in the restaurant explaining himself . " To certain people , the smartest people , life is just a game , " he explained . You get out of it what you can . There were various men who played the game in variousways . Some , he said , went in for being very , very respectable . They were in business , as he was . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal or iron or machinery . Or they ran factories or mines . It was all one game . The money game.  | " Do you know , " he said to Ethel , " I think you are of the same sort I am . " Nothing much takes hold of you either . " We are of the same breed . " Ethel had n't felt flattered . She was amused , but at the same time a little hurt . " If it 's true I do n't want it to be . " Just the same she was interested , perhaps in his assurance , his boldness . He had lived , as a boy and as a young man , in the town in Iowa . He was the one son in the family and there were three daughters . Hs father had seemed always to have plenty of money . They had lived well , for that town they had lived rather in the grand manner . There had been automobiles , horses , a big house , money spent right and left . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father . He never asked how it was spent . Then the crash crone and the father went to jail . He did not live long . Fortunately there was insurance money . The mother and daughters , by being careful , could get along . " I suppose my sisters will marry . They have n't yet . Not one of them has succeeded in hooking a man , " Fred Wells said . He himself had wanted to be a newspaper man . That had been his passion . He had come to Chicago and had got a job as a reporter on one of the Chicago dailies but presently had given it up . There was n't , he said , enough money in it . He was sorry about that . " I would have been a crack newspaper man , " he said . " Nothing would have jarred me , nothing would have fazed me . " He kept drinking , eating and talking of himself . Perhaps the liquor he drank made him bolder in talk , more reckless . It did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does me , " Ethel thought . " Suppose there had been a man 's or a woman 's reputationto be destroyed , " he said brightly . " Let 's say over a sex scandal , something of that sort . .. the kind of thing that is so abhorrent to a lot of these literary men I know , top171a lot of so-called high-class people . Are n't they a lot of clean ones ? The damn children . " It had seemed to Ethel that the man before her must hate the people among whom she had found him , the men whose books he collected . There was a tangle of emotions in him as in her . He continued to talk brightly , smilingly , without outward show of emotion . Writers , he said , the higher-ups among writers were also without scruples . Such a one had a love affair with some woman . What happened ? It came to an end after a time . " There is no such thing as love really . It 's all a lot of moonshineand bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a great literary figure , ha ! Full of words , as I am . " But making so many damn pretensions about the words he slings out . " As though anything in the world really mattered so much . After it is all over with some woman , what does he do ? He makes literary material of it . " He fools no one . Every one knows . " He returned to his talk of being a newspaper man , dwelling on it . " Suppose a woman , married , let 's say . " He was himself a married man , had married a woman who was the daughter of the man who owned the business he was now in . The man was dead . Now he controlled the business . If his own wife . . . " She had better not fool with me . . . I certainly would n't stand anything like that , " he said . Suppose a woman , married and all that , were to get into an affair with a man not her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . They were prominentpeople . He had been a reporter for a time , but no such case had fallen into his hands . He seemed to regret it . " They are prominent people . They are rich , or in the arts , big people in the arts , or in politics or something of that sort . " The man had got himself launched . " And so the woman tries to work me . Let 's say I am the managing editor of the paper . She comes to me . She weeps . For God 's sake ,   remember I have children . " You have , eh ? Why did n't you think of that when you got into this ? ' Little children having their lives ruined . Fudge ! Was my own life ruined because my father died in jail ? It may have hurt my sisters . I do n't know . It may make it hard for them to get respectable husbands . I 'd rip her right open . I 'd have no mercy . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Am I like that ? God help me , am I like that ? " Ethel thought . He wanted to hurt some one . Fred Wells , coming to Chicago , after his father 's death , had n't stayed long in the newspaper game . There had n't been , for him , enough money to be made . He had got into advertising , into an advertising agency as a copy writer . " I could have been a writer , " he declared . lie had in fact written severalshort stories . They were mystery stories . He liked writingthem and had no trouble getting them published . He wrote for one of the magazines that print that sort of thing . " I also wrote true confessions , " he said . He laughed , telling Ethel about it . Ile had imagined himself a young wife with a tubercular husband . She had always been an innocent woman but had n't specially wanted to be . She took her husband out West , to Arizona . The husband was nearly gone but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that time the woman , in Fred Wells ' story , was unfaithful to him . There was a man there , a young man she wanted , and so she used to creep out with him at night , into the desert . It had given Fred Wells an opportunity , that story , that confession . The magazine publishers had grabbed at it . He had imagined himself the wife of that sick man . There he lay , slowly dying . He had imagined how the young wife was filled with remorse . Fred Wells sat at the table in the Chicagorestaurant with Ethel , stroking his mustache and tellingabout it all . He described quite perfectly what he saidp173were the feelings of the woman . At night she used to wait until darkness came . There were soft desert moonlit nights . The young man she had taken as a lover came creeping toward the house in which she lived with her sick husband , a house sitting at the edge of a town in the desert and she crept out toward him . One night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw the lover again . " I threw in a lot of remorse , " Fred Wells said , laughing again . " I made it thick . I fairly wallowed in it . I suppose about all the real fun that imaginary woman of mine ever had was out there with the other man on the moonlit desert , but afterwards I made remorse fairly ooze out of her . " You see I wanted to sell it . I wanted it published , " he said . Fred Wells got Ethel Long into a mess . It was n't nice . It was , she knew afterwards , her own fault . One day , a week after she had dined with him , he had called her on the phone . " I 've got something swell on , " he said . There was a man in town , a famous Englishman , a writer , and Fred had got in with him . He proposed a party . Ethel was to get another woman and Fred would get the Englishman . " He is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had him in hand , " Fred explained . " We 'll give him another kind of a party . " Did Ethel know of another woman she could get . " Yes , " she said . " Get a live one , " he said . " You know . " What did he mean by that ? She was sure of herself . " If a man like that . . . if he can put anything over on me . " She was bored . Why not ? There was a woman , working in the library with her who might do . She was a year younger than Ethel , a little slip of a woman who had a passion for writers . The idea of meeting a famous man like that Englishmanwould be exciting to her . She was rather pale , the daughter of a respectable family in one of the Chicago suburbs and had herself a vague desire to be a writer .   " Yes , I 'll go , " she said , when Ethel spoke to her . She was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The women out at the university that had got crushes on her had been of this sort . She admired Ethel 's style and what she thought her boldness . " Do you want to go ? " " 0 , yeees . " The woman 's voice trembled with excitement . " The men are married . You understand that ? " The woman , whose name was Helen , hesitated for a moment ; this was something new to her . Her lips trembled . Evidently she thought ... Perhaps she thought ... " A woman ca n't always go on , never having adventures . " She thought ... " One has to acceptsuch things in a sophisticated world . " Fred Wells as an example of the sophisticated man . Ethel had tried to make it all quite clear . She did n't . The woman was testing her . She was being excited about the idea of meeting a well-known writer , an English one . There was no way for her to fathom Ethel 's real attitude , just at that time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take risks , test herself perhaps . " We 'll dine , " she said , " and then we 'll go to Mr. Wells ' apartment . His wife will not be there . There will be drinks . " " There will be only the two men . You are not afraid ? " Helen asked . " No . " Ethel was in an amused cynical mood . " I can take care of myself . " " Very well , I 'll go . " Ethel would never forget that evening with the three people . It was one of the adventures in her own life that had made her what she was . " I 'm not so damn nice . " Thoughts drifting through her head on an afternoon later , when she drove over Georgia roads with her father . He was another one , puzzled by his own life . She was not beingP175f rank and open with him , and had not been with that naive woman Helen she had taken to the party with the two men , that night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party with Fred Wells was a big-shouldered , rather crumpled man . He seemed curious and interested in what was going on . Such Englishmen coming to America where their books sold in quantities , where they came to lecture and gather in money .. . There was something in the attitude of such men , toward all Americans . " The Americans are such strange children . My dear fellow , they are amazing . " Something amazing , always a bit patronizing . " The lion 's whelps . " You felt like saying , " Damn your eyes . You go to hell . " With him , that night in Fred Wells ' apartment in Chicago , it might just have been a satisfaction of curiosity . " I 'll see what this sort of Americans are like . " Fred Wells was a spender . He took the others to an expensive restaurant to dine and then to his apartment . That also was expensive . He was proud of it . The Englishman was very attentive to the woman Helen . Was Ethel jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . She would have liked the Englishman to pay more attention to her . She fancied herself saying things to him , trying to upset his composure . Helen was obviously too naive . She worshipped . When they had all got to Fred 's apartment Fred kept serving drinks and almost at once Helen got half drunk and as she got more and more drunk , and , Ethel thought , more and more foolish , the Englishman grew alarmed . He even got noble ... the noble Englishman . Blood will tell . " My dear fellow , one has to be a gentleman . " Was Ethel sore because the man was linking her , in his mind , with Fred Wells ? " To hell with you , " she kept wanting to say . Ile was like a grown man left suddenly in a room with children who were misbehaving ... " God knows what he expects to happen here , " Ethel thought . Helen had got up out of her chair after several drinks and had walked uncertainly across a room in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . Her dress was disarranged . There was too much leg showing . She kept throwing her legs about and laughing foolishly . Fred Wells kept giving her drinks . " Well , she has good legs , has n't she ? " Fred said . Fred Wells was too coarse . He was really rotten . Ethel knew it . What she resented was the thought that the Englishman did not know she knew . The Englishman began speaking to Ethel . " What is all this about ? Why is he intent on getting this woman drunk ? " He was getting nervous and evidently wished he had n't acceptedFred Wells ' invitation . He and Ethel sat for a time by a little table with drinks before them . The Englishman kept asking her questions about herself , what part of the country she had come from and what she was doing in Chicago . Ile had found out slit . was a university woman . There was still ... ill his manner ... something ... that air of being outside it all ... an English gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Ethel was becoming aroused . " A queer sort , these American university women if this is a sample , if this is the way they spend their evenings , " the Englishman was thinking . He said nothing of the sort . Ile kept trying to keep the conversation going . He had got into something , into a situationhe did n't like . Ethel was glad . " How am Ito get gracefullyout of this place and away from these people ? " He got up , intending no doubt to excuse himself , to leave . But there was Helen , drunk now . The Englishman 's sense of chivalry had been awakened . At that moment Fred Wells appeared and took the Englishmaninto his library . After all , Fred was a business man . " I have him here . I have some of his books here . I might as well get him to autograph them , " Fred was thinking . Fred was also thinking of something else . Perhaps the Englishman did not understand what Fred had in mind . Ethelp177did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together into the library and there was talk in there . Afterwards , after what happened to herself later that evening , Ethel could pretty well guess what was said . Fred had simply taken it for granted the Englishman was another like himself . The whole tone of that evening had suddenly changed . Ethel had become frightened . Because she had been bored and wanting excitement she had got herself into a mess . She imagined the conversation between the two men in the nearby room . Fred Wells speaking . . . he was no such man as Harold Grey , the university instructor ... " Here I have got this woman for you " ... meaning the woman Helen . Fred , in there in that room , speaking to the other man . Ethel was n't thinking of Helen now . She was thinking of herself . There was Helen , lying half helpless on a couch . Would a man want a woman in that state , a woman made half helpless by drink ? It would be an assault . There might be men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was trembling with fear now . She had been a fool to allow herself to get into the power of a man like Fred Wells . There were the two men in the nearby room talking . She could hear their voices . Fred Wells had a sharp voice . He said something to his guest , the Englishman , and then there was silence . Already , without a doubt , he had attended to the matter of having the man sign his books . He would have got them signed . He was making a proposal . " Well , you see I have got a woman for you . There is one for you and one for me . You may take the one who is lying out there on the couch . " I have , you see , got her quite helpless . There wo n't be much of a struggle . " You may take her into a bedroom . You will not be disturbed . You may leave the other woman to me . " There must have been something of that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Wells and then came suddenly out . He did not look at Fred Wells , did not speak to him again , although he did look sharply at Ethel . He was judging her . " So you are into it , too ? " A hot wave of resentment was running through Ethel . The English writer said nothing but went into a hallway where his coat was hanging and getting it and a wrap that had been worn by the woman Helen , came back into the room . He had gone a little pale . He was trying to be composed . IIe was angry and excited . Fred Wells had come back into the room and stood in a doorway . Perhaps the English writer had said something nasty to Fred . " I 'll not let hint , because he is a fool , spoil my own party , " Fred was thinking . Fred 's own party was to be Ethel herself . She knew that now . Evidently the Englishman thought Ethel was one of Fred 's kind . He was n't concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passing and she was growing angry , ready for fight . It would he amusing , Ethel thought swiftly , if the Englishmanhad made a mistake . 1 le is going to save the one who does not want to be saved . " She 's the easy one to get , not me , " she thought proudly . " So he is that sort of a man . He is one of the virtuous ones . " To hell with him . I have given him this chance . If he does n't want to take it , it 's all right with me . " She meant she had given the man the chance to know her , had he really wanted to . " How silly , " she thought afterwards . She had given the man no chance at all . The Englishman evidently felt responsibility for the woman Helen . She was n't , after all , quite helpless , was n't quite gone . He got her to her feet and helped her put on her coat . She clung to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caressed his cheek . It was evident to Ethel that she was ready to surrender and that the Englishman did n't want her . " It 's all right . I 'll get a cab and we 'll drive . Presently you 'll be all right , " he said . Earlier in the evening he had foundp179out certain facts about Helen , as he had about Ethel . He knew she was an unmarried woman living somewhere in a suburb with her father and mother . She was n't so far gone but that she would know the address of her house . Half holding the woman in his arms he led her out of the apartment and down a flight of stairs . ETHEL was as a person who had been struck a blow . What happened in the apartment that evening happened suddenly . She sat nervously fingering a glass . She was pale . Fred Wells did n't hesitate . He stood silently , waiting until the other man with the other woman had gone and then came straight at her . " And you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man on her . Ethel stood up facing him . Now there was no smile on his face . He was obviously some sort of perverted man , a sadist perhaps . She faced him . In some odd way she rather liked the situation she had got herself into . It was to be a fight . " I 'll see that you do not run out on me , " Fred Wells said . " If you go out of here to-night you will go naked . " He put out his hand swiftly and got a grip on her dress at the neck . With a quick movement he tore the dress . " You 'll have to go naked if you go out of here before I have what I want . " " You think so ? " Ethel had gone chalky white . There was , as has been suggested , a way in which she rather liked the situation . In the struggle that followed she did not cry out . Her dress got terribly torn . Once during the struggle Fred Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down . She sprang quickly up . Understanding had come to her quickly . The man before her would not have dared carry on the struggle had she cried out in a loud voice . There were other people living in the same apartment building . He wanted to conquer her . He did not want her asp180a normal man wanted a woman . He got them drunk and assaulted them when they were helpless or he got them through terror . The two people in the apartment struggled silently . Once during the struggle he threw her across a couch in the room in which the four people had been sitting . It hurt her back . She did not feel the hurt much at the moment . That came later . Afterwards for several days , her back was lame . For just a moment Fred Wells thought he had her . There was a smile of triumph on his face . His eyes were cunning , like the eyes of an animal . She thought  --  the thought came to her  --  she was for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " I wonder if he got his wife this way , " she thought . Probably not . He would , such a man would , with the woman he intended to marry , a woman who had money he wanted , her own kind of power , with such a one he would try to create an impression of manliness in himself . He might even have talked to her of love . Ethel wanted to laugh . " I love you . You are my darling . You are everything to me . " She remembered that the man had children , he had a small son and a daughter . He would have tried to create , in his wife 's mind , the impression of being something he knew he could n't be and perhaps did n't want to be , a man of the type of the Englishmanwho had just left the apartment , " an honorable man , " a man of a sort he was always courting and at the same time despising . He would have tried to create that impression in the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Taking it out on other women . During the early evening , while they were all dining together at a downtown restaurant , he had kept talking to the Englishman about American women . He had been trying subtly to destroy the man 's respect for American women . He had kept the conversationp181on a certain low plane , ready to retreat , smiling as he talked . The Englishman had remained curious and puzzled . The struggle in the apartment did not last long and Ethel thought it was a good thing it did n't . The man was stronger than she was . At the last perhaps she would have cried out . The man would not have dared hurt her too seriously . He wanted to break her down , to tame her . He was depending on her not wanting it known she was alone with him in his apartment at night . If he succeeded with her he might even pay her money to keep quiet . " You are not a fool . You knew what I wanted when you came here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . She had been a fool . She managed by a quick movement to get free . There was a door into a hallway and she ran along the hallway and into the kitchen of the apartment . Earlier in the evening Fred Wells had been slicing oranges to put into drinks . There was a large knife lying on a table . She threw the kitchen door closed behind her , but she herself opened it for Fred Wells ' entrance , slashing at his face with the knife , just missing his face . He backed away . She was backing him down a hallway . The hallway was brightly lighted . He could see the look in her eyes . " You bitch , " he said as he backed away from her . " You damn bitch . " He was n't afraid . He was cautious , watching her . His eyes were shining . " I guess you would , you damn bitch , " he said and smiled . He was the sort of man who , if he met her the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " You got the best of me but I may have another chance at you , " his smile would say . She got her coat and got away , going out of the apartmentat a back door . There was a door leading out onto a small balcony at the back and she got through that . He didp182not try to follow . Afterwards she went clown a little iron stairway to a small grass plot at the back of the building . She did not go at once . For a time she sat on the stairs . There were people sitting in the apartment below the one occupied by Fred Wells . Men and women were sitting quietly in there . There was a baby somewhere in that apartment . She heard it cry . Men and women were sitting at a card table and one of the women got up and went to the baby . She heard voices and laughter . Fred Wells would not dare follow her there . " It is one kind of man , " she told herself that night ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had got out through the yard and a gate and into an alleyway and finally into a street . It was a quiet residential street . She had some money in her coat pocket . The coat partially covered the torn places in her dress . She had lost her hat . There was a car , evidently a private car , with a Negro chauffeur , standing before an apartment building . She went up to the man and thrust a bill into his hand . " I 'm in trouble , " she said . " Run get me a cab . You may keep that , " she said , holding out the bill . She was amused , angry , hurt . It was n't the man Fred Wells who had hurt her most . " I was too sure of myself . I thought the other woman Helen was the naive one . " I am myself naive . I 'm a fool . " " Are you hurt ? " the Negro had asked . He was a large man of middle age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it in the light from the apartment entrance . One of her eyes was swollen . Afterwards it became black . Already she was thinking of the tale she would tell when she had got to the place where she had a room . An attempt at robbery , two men had attacked her in the street . Knocking her down , being quite brutal with her . " They snatched my purse and ran . I do n't want to report it . I don'tp183want to get my name in the papers . " It would be understood and believed in Chicago . She told the colored man a tale . She had been fighting with her husband . He laughed . He understood that . He left his car and ran to get her a cab . While he was gone Ethel stood with her back against the wall of a building , standingwhere the heavier shadows were . Fortunately no one passed to see her , battered and bruised , standing and waiting.  |p184IT  was a summer night and Ethel was lying in bed in her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past midnight and the night was hot . She could not sleep . There were words in her , little flocks of words , like birds flying ... " a person has to decide , to decide . " What ? Thoughts became words . Ethel 's lips moved . " It hurts . It hurts . What you do hurts . What you do n't do hurts . " She had come in late and , being tired from much thinking and feeling , had simply slipped off her clothes in the darkness of her room . Her clothes fell from her , leaving her there naked  --  what she was . She knew that when she had come in , her father 's wife Blanche had been awake . Ethel and her father both slept in rooms downstairs but Blanche had moved herself upstairs . It was as though she had wanted to get as far away from her husband as possible . Escape from man . .. for the woman ... to escape that . Ethel had thrown herself , quite naked , on her bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room in a house becomes a prison . Its walls push against you . Now and then she stirred restlessly . Little waves of feeling ran through her . She had had the feeling , when she had crept into the house , that night , ' half ashamed , annoyed with herself for what had happened during the evening , that Blanche was awake and had been watching for her return to the house . When Ethel entered , Blanche might even have come softly to . the head of the stairs to look down . There was a little light burning in the hallway downstairs and the stairs went up out of the hall/way . If Blanche had been up there , looking down , Ethel would have been unable to see her in the darkness above . Blanche would have waited , perhaps to laugh , and Ethel felt like laughing at herself . It takes a woman to laugh at a woman . Women can really love each other . They dare . Women can hate each other ; they can hurt and laugh . They dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she kept thinking . She was thinking of her evening . There had been anotheradventure , with another man . " I have done it again . " This had been her third one . Three tries at something with men . Letting them try something  --  to see if they could . Like the others , it had n't worked . She did n't quite know why . " He did n't get me . He did n't get me . " What did she mean by that ? What was it to be got ? What was it she wanted ? She had thought she wanted this one . It was the young man , Red Oliver , she had been seeing in the library . She had looked at him in there . He kept coming in . The library was open on three evenings a week and he always appeared . He spoke to her more and more . The library closed at ten and , after eight they were often alone . People had gone to the movies . He helped close for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books to be put away . If he had really got her . He had n't dared . She had got him . It was because he was too shy , too young , too inexperienced . She herself had n't been patient enough . She did n't know him . She might just have used him to find out whether or not she wanted him . " It was unfair , unfair . " To find out about another and older man , whether or not she wanted him . At first the younger one , young Red Oliver , who began coming to the library , looking at her with his young eyes ,  | stirring her , had n't dared offer to walk home with her but had left her at the library door . Later he grew a little bolder . He wanted to touch her , ached to touch her . She knew that . " May I walk along with you ? " he had asked , awkwardly enough . " Yes . Why not ? It will be very pleasant . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her sometimes at night . The Georgia summer evenings were long . They were hot . When they got to the house there was the judge , her father , sitting on the porch . Blanche was there . Often the judge had gone to sleep in his chair . The nights were hot . There was a swinging couch and Blanche had curled herself up in that . She lay there wide awake , watching . When Ethel came in , she spoke , having seen young Oliver leave Ethel at the gate . l le lingered there , hating to go . He wanted ' to be Ethel 's lover . She knew that . It was in hiD eyes now , in his shy hesitating speech ... a young man in love , with an elder woman , suddenly , passionately in love . She could do as she pleased with him . She could open the gates for him , let him into what he thought would be paradise . It was tempting . " I will have to do it if it is done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the gates have opened . He is too shy to push forward , " Ethel thought . She did n't think it definitely . She thought it . There was a feeling of being superior to the young man . It was nice . It was n't so nice . " Well , " Blanche said . Her voice was small , sharp and inquiring . " Well , " she said . And " Well , " Ethel replied . The two women looked at each other and Blanche laughed . Ethel did not laugh . She smiled . There was love between the two women . There was hatred . There was something man seldom understands . When the judge was awake , both women remained silent and Ethel went at once to her room . She got a book and , lying in bed , tried to read . The nights that summer were almost too hot for sleep . The judge had got a radio and on some nights hep187turned it on . It was in the living-room of the house downstairs . When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sat beside it and slept . He snored when he slept . Presently Blanche arose and went upstairs . The two women left the judge sitting there , asleep in the chair near the radio . The noises , coming from distant cities , from Chicago where Ethel had lived , from Cincinnati , from St. Louis , did not awaken him . There were men talking about tooth paste , bands played , men made speeches , Negro voices sang . Northern white singers were trying hard , valiantly , to sing like Negroes . The noises went on a long time . " WRYK ... CK .. . coming to you through the courtesy of . . . change your underwear . . . get some new underwear .... " Brush your teeth . Go to your dentist . " Courtesy of . " Chicago , St. Louis , New York , Langdon , Georgia . What do you suppose is going on in Chicago to-night ? Is it hot up there ? " The exact time is now ten-nineteen . " The judge , awakening suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another day had gone . There were too many days , Ethel thought . There she was , in that house , in that town . Now her father had become afraid of her . She knew how he felt . He had brought her back there . He had schemed and saved . Her going away to school , staying away for several years , had cost money . Then , at last this position had come up . She had become the librarian of the town . Did she owe something to him , to the town because of him ? To be respectable . .. as he was . " To hell with that . " She had come back there to where she had lived as a girl , where she had gone to high school . When she had first come home her father had wanted to talk to her . He had even looked forward to her coming , thinking they might be companions.  | " He and I pals . " Spirit of Rotary . " I make a pal of my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are pals . " He was angry and resentful . " She is going to make a fool of me , " he thought . It was because of men . Men were after Ethel . He knew it . She had begun running about with a mere boy , but that was n't all . Since she had come home , another man had been attracted to her . Ile was an older man , a man much older than herself and his name was Tom Riddle . He was a lawyer of the town , a criminal lawyer and he had made money . he was an alert scheming man , a Republicanand a politician . Ile handled Federal patronage in that part of the State . Ile was no gentleman . And he had been attracted to Ethel . " Yes , " her father would be thinking , " she would have to go and attract one of that sort . " When she had been in town some weeks he came to see her at the library , coming boldly up to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Red Oliver , in him . " I want to talk with you , " he had said to Ethel , looking directly into her eyes . He was a rather tall man of forty-five with thin hair , turning gray , and with a heavy pock-marked face and small bright eyes . He had been married , but his wife was dead , had been dead for ten years . Although he was said to be tricky and was not respected by some of the outstanding men of town  --  men like Ethel 's father , who being Georgians were Democrats and gentlemen  --  he was the most successfullawyer in town . He was the most successful criminal lawyer in that part of the State . He was alive , sly and clever in the court room and the other lawyers and the judge were both afraid and envious of him . It was said he made money out of the distribution of Federal patronage . " He consorts with niggers and cheap whites , " his enemies said , but Tom Riddle did n't seem to care . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown enormously . He owned the best hotel in Langdonand had other property scattered about town . And this man had become enamored of Ethel . " You suit me , " he said to her . He invited her to go riding with him in his car and she went . It was another way of annoying her father , being seen in public with that man . She did not want that . That was n't her purpose . It seemed inevitable . And there was Blanche . Was she merely malicious ? Had she taken some queer perverted kind of fancy to Ethel ? Although she herself seemed to care nothing for clothes , she had a constant interest in Ethel 's clothes . " You are going to be with a man . Do put on the red gown . " A queer look in her eyes ... hatred ... love . If Judge Long did not know of Ethel 's going about with Tom Riddle , being seen with him in public , Blanche would let him know . Tom Riddle did not attempt to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined . " Why , I do not expect you to fall in love with me , " he said one evening , when they were riding over the red Georgia roads past a pine forest . The red road ran up and down over low hills . Tom Riddle stopped the car at the edge of the forest . " You would n't expect me to grow sentimental , but I do sometimes , " he said laughing . Beyond the forest the sun was going down . He referred to the loveliness of the evening . It was late on a summer evening , one of the evenings when the library was not open . All of the land in that part of Georgia was red and the sun was setting in a red haze . It was hot . Tom had stopped the car and had got out , to stretch . He was clad in a white suit , somewhat soiled . He lighted a cigar and spat on the ground . " Pretty grand , is n't it ? " he said to Ethel , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright yellow and with the top down . He walked up and down and then came and stood by the car . He had , from the beginning , a way of saying . . . without saying , without words ... his eyes said it ... his manner said it ... " We understand each other ... we should understand each other . " It was tantalizing . It interested Ethel . He began talking of the Southern country , of his love for it . " I guess you know about me , " he said . The man was said to have come from a good Georgia family in a neighboring county . Formerlyhis people had owned slaves . They had been people of some importance . They had been ruined by the Civil War . By the time Tom had come into the world they had nothing . He had managed in some way to escape the slavery of the soil in that country and had got himself educated sufficiently to become a lawyer . Now he was a prosperous man . He had been married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both sons , and they were dead . One had died in infancy and the other , like Ethel 's brother , had been killed in the World War . " I married when I was a mere boy , " he said to Ethel . It was queer being with him . In spite of a rather rough exterior , something hard-boiled in his attitude toward life , he had a quick sharp trick of intimacy . He had got it dealing with many people . There was something in his manner that said . . . " I 'm not good , not even honest ... I 'm a man like you . " I do things . I pretty much do as I please . " Do n't come to me expecting to find any Southern gentleman . .. like Judge Long . .. like Clay Barton .. . like Tom Shaw . " It was a manner he continually used in the court room with juries . Jurymen were , almost always , just commonenough , ordinary men . " Well , here we are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed . " There are certain legal formalities to be gone through here but we are men together . Life is so and so . So and so has happened . There is a sensible view to be taken of this matter . We common dubs have to stand together . " A grin . " Here is how I believe men like you and me feel . We are sensible men . We have to take life as it comes . "  |p191He  had been married and his wife had died . He told I.:thel frankly about it . " I want you for my wife , " he said . " You are , of course , not in love with me . I do not expect it . I low could you be ? " He told her of his marriage . " To be frank with you , it was a shot-gun marriage . " He laughed . " I was a boy and had gone to Atlanta where I was trying to work my way through school . I met her . " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chance came and I took her . " He knew of the feeling Ethel had got for the young man , Red Oliver . He was the sort of man who would know everything that went on in a town . He himself had defied the town . He had always done that . " While my wife was alive , I behaved , " he said to Ethel . He had become , in that queer way , without her asking it , without her doing anything to lead him on , intimate with her about his own life without asking anything of the sort of her . When they were together he talked while she sat beside him and listened . He had big shoulders that were slightly stooped . Although she was a tall woman , he was nearly a head taller . " So I married the woman . I thought I ought to marry her . She was in the family way . " He said it as one might say ... " She was a blonde , or a brunette . " He took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I wanted to marry her . I wanted a woman , needed one . Maybe I was in love . I do n't know . " The man Tom Riddle talked to Ethel in that way . He stood beside the car and spat on the ground . He lit a cigar . He did not try to touch her . He made her comfortable . He made her want to talk . " I could tell him everything , all the mean low-down things in myself , " she thought sometimes . " She was the daughter of a man in whose house I  --  a room . He was a workingman . He fired the boilers in some sort of a manufacturing plant . She helped her mother take care of the rooms in a rooming house . " I began to want her . There was something in her eyes . She thought she wanted me . " Again laughter . Was he laughingat himself or the woman he had married ? " My chance came . One night we were alone together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Riddle laughed . He told Ethel as though they had been intimate for a long time . It was odd , amusing ... it was nice . After all , in Langdon , Georgia , she was the daughter of her father . It would have been impossible for Ethel 's father ever in his whole life to have talked so frankly to a woman . He would never , even after long years of living with her , have dared talk so frankly to Ethel 's mother or to Blanche , his new wife . It would have been a bit more in the picture of Southern womanhood  --  after all she was a Southern woman , of a so-called good family  --  to have been a bit shocked . Ethel was n't . Tom Riddle had known she would n't be . How much did he know about her ? It was n't as though she wanted him . .. as a woman is presumed to want a man ... the dream . .. the poetry of existence . To be stirred , aroused , awakened , Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was stirred by him . Although Tom Riddle took her out in his car a dozen times that summer he never offered to make love to her . He did not attempt to hold her hand or to kiss her . " Why , you are a grown woman . Besides being a woman , you are a person , " he seemed to be saying . It was sure she had no physical impulse toward him . He knew that . " Not yet . " He could be patient . " It 's all right . Perhaps that will come . We 'll see . " He had told her about life with his first wife . " She had no flair , " he said . " She had no flair , no style , there was nothing she could do to my house . She was a good woman , all right . She could not do anything to me or to the children I had by her.  | " I began to play about , I have been doing that for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There were all sorts of stories running about town . Since Tom Riddle had come to Langdon , as a young man , and had set up a law practice there , he had always been in with the rougher elements of the town . He was in thick with them . They were his friends . His cronies from the beginning of his life in Langdon had been gamblers , young Southern men who had taken to drink , politicians . Formerly , when there were saloons in the town , he was always in the saloons . Respectable men of the town said he conducted his law office from a saloon . At one time he had taken up with a woman , the wife of a railroad conductor . Her husband was much away from town and she rode openly about in Tom Riddle 's car . The affair had been conducted with startling boldness . When the husband was in town , Tom Riddle went nevertheless to his house . He drove there and went in . The woman had a child and the town said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they said . " Tom Riddle has bought her husband off . " It had gone on for a long time , and then , suddenly , the railroad conductor was transferred to another division and he and his wife , with the child , had left town . So Tom Riddle was that kind of man . Ethel lay in her bed on a hot summer night thinking of him and of things he had said to her . He had made an offer of marriage . " Any time you think well of it , O. K. " A grin . He was tall and stoop-shouldered . He had a queer little trick of occasionally shaking his shoulders  --  as though to shake off a burden . " You will not be in love , " he said . " I am not the sort that could inspire romantic love in a woman . " What , with my pock-marked face , my bald head ? " You may get tired of living in that house . " He meant her father 's house . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Tom Riddle had been frank enough about his reasons for wanting her . " You have style . You would decorate a man 's life . It would be worth while making money for you . I like making money . I like the game of it . If you can make up your mind to come live with me , then afterwards , after we begin living together . . . . Something tells me we are made for each other . " He had wanted to say something about Ethel 's passion for the younger man , Red Oliver , but had been too shrewd to do so . " He is too young for you , my dear . He is too immature . You have a flair for him now but it will pass . " If you feel like experimenting with him , go on and do it . " Could he have thought that ? He had n't said so . One day he came for Ethel when there was a ball game to be played between the Langdon mill team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team from a neighboring town . The Langdon team won and it was largely Red 's playing that had made them wi , .. The game was held on one of the long summer evenings and Tom Riddle took Ethel in his car . It was n't just his interest in the baseballgame . She was sure of that . She had begun to like being with him , although she felt ; n his presence none of the quick physical longings she felt Red Oliver 's presence . On the very evening before the ball game , Red Oliver had been in the library , sitting at a table in there , and he had run his hand through his thick hair . There had been a quick stab of desire in Ethel . She wanted to run her hand through his hair , hold him close . She took a step toward him . It would be so easy to sweep him away . He was young and sex hungry for her . She knew that . Tom Riddle did not take Ethel to the grounds where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . She sat beside him wondering . He seemed for the moment quite lost in admiration of the younger man 's playing . Was it a bluff ? It had been a day when Red Oliver had played sensap195tionally . Balls came singing down toward him over the hard clay infield and he fielded them brilliantly . He led his team at bat , once , at a critical moment , knocking out a three base hit , and Tom Riddle squirmed in his car seat . " He 's the best player we ever had in this town , " Tom said . Could he really be like that , wanting Ethel for himself , knowing of her feeling for Red and , at the time , could he be carried away by Red 's playing ? *HAD he wanted Ethel to experiment ? She had done it . On the hot summer night , as she lay , quite naked , on her bed in her room , unable to sleep , nervous and excited , the windows of the room open , hearing from outside the noises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father in a neighboring room , herself upset , angry with herself , on that very evening she had carried it through . She was angry , upset , annoyed . " Why did I do it ? " It had been easy enough . There had been the young man , really in her eyes a boy , walking along the street with her . It had been one of the evenings when the library was not officially open but she had gone back there . She was thinking of Tom Riddle and of the proposal he had made to her . Could a woman do that , go to live with a man , lie with him , be his wife ... as a sort of bargain ? He had seemed to think it would be all right . " I wo n't crowd you . " After all , beauty in a man cuts little figure to a woman . " It is a question of living , of everyday living . " There is a kind of friendship achieved that is something more than a friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something else . " Tom Riddle talking . It was as though he addressed a jury . He had big lips and his face was heavily pock-marked . Sometimes he leaned toward her , talking earnestly . " A man gets tired going it alone , " he said . He had an idea . He hadp196been married . Ethel did not remember his first wife . The Riddle house was in another part of town . It was a fine house on a poor street . There was a large lawn . Tom Riddle had built his house among the houses of the sort of people with whom he associated . They were certainly not the first families of Langdon . When the wife was alive she seldom left her own house . She must have been one of the meek mouse-like kind who devote themselves to housekeeping . When Torn Riddle had prospered he had built his house on that street . Once it had been a very respectable neighborhood . There had been an old house that had belonged to one of the so-called aristocraticfamilies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a big yard going down to a small creek that turnbledclown into the river below the town . The whole yard had become overgrown with dense bushes he had cleared away . Ile always had men working about his place . Often he took the cases of poor whites or Negroes who had got into trouble with the law , and if they could n't pay him he let them work out the fee on the place . Tom had said of his first wife , " Well , I married her . I just about had to . " After all , and in spite of the life he had led Tom was still , in his own way , an aristocrat at bottom . He had contempt . He did n't care for the respectable standards of others and did not go to church . He laughed at churchgoingpeople like Ethel 's father and when the K.K.K. was strong in Langdon he had laughed at that . He had got a sense of something that was more Northernthan Southern . That was the reason he was a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said once to Ethel , speaking of his Republicanism . " Of course , " he said , laughing cynically , " I make money by it . " " Just the same , in our day in America it is money that rules . The big money crowd in the North , in New York , have picked the Republican Party . They are betting on that . I am stringing with them.  | " Life is a game , " he said . " There are the poor whites . To a man they are Democrats . " He laughed . " Do you remember what happened a few years ago ? " Ethel remembered . He spoke of a particularly brutal lynching . It had happened in a small town , not far from Langdon . A lot of people from Langdon had gone there to take part in it . It had happened at night and people had gone in cars . The Negro , accused of the rape of a poor white girl , the daughter of a small farmer , was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff had two deputies with him and a string of cars had gone down along the road to meet him . The cars were filled with young men from Langdon , merchants and respectables . There were Fords , filled with poor white employees of the Langdon cotton mills . It had been a kind of circus , a public entertainment , Tom said . " Nice , eh ! " Not all of the men who went to the lynching had a part in it . It had happened while Ethel was a student in Chicago . Afterwards it turned out that the girl , who said she had been raped , was abnormal . She was of low mentality . A good many men , whites and blacks , had already been with her . They took the Negro from the sheriff and his deputies and strung him up to a tree , riddled his body with bullets . Then they burned his body . " They seemed unable to let it alone , " Tom said . He laughed , a cynical laugh . Many of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , seeing the Negro man ... he was a huge black .. .. " He would go two hundred and fifty pounds , " Tom said , laughing . He spoke as though the Negro man were a hog butchered by the crowd , as a kind of holiday performance . .. respectable men going down to see it done , standing at the edge of the crowd . Life in Langdonwas what it was . " They look down on me . Let them . " He could put men or women on the witness stand in court , torture them mentally . It was a game . He liked it . He could twist what they had said , lead them into saying things they did n't mean . The law was a game . All of life was a game . He had got his house . He had made money . He liked to go to New York several times a year . He wanted a woman who would decorate his life . He wanted Ethel as he might have wanted a fine horse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a proposal for a kind of whoredom , a kind of high-class whoredom ? Ethel was puzzled . She had resisted . She had left the house that night because she could not bear being either with her father or with Blanche . Blanche also had a kind of talent . She had noted everything about Ethel , what clothes she wore , the mood she was in . Now her father had become afraid of his daughter , of what she might do . He took it out in silence , sitting at table in the Long house , saying nothing . He knew about her going to ride with Tom Riddle and walking through the streets with young Red . Red Oliver had become a mill hand and Tom Riddle was a shady lawyer . She was endangering his own position in the town , his own dignity . And there was Blanche , amused , really pleased because her husband was displeased . It had got to that with Blanche . She lived by the discomfiture of others . Ethel had left the house in disgust . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was tired and she had to make an effort to walk with her accustomed dignity , to keep her feet from dragging . She went through Main Street toward the library , just off Main Street . Black clouds were drifting across an evening sky . There were people gathered in Main Street . On that evening Ethel saw Tom Shaw , the little man who was president of the cotton mill where Red Oliver worked . He was being driven hurriedly through Main Street . There was ap199train going North . Very likely he was off to New York . A Negro man drove the big car . Ethel thought of something Tom Riddle had said . " There goes the Prince , " Tom had said . " Hello , there goes the Prince of Langdon . " In the new South Tom Shaw was the sort of man who had become the prince , the leader . There was a woman , a young woman , going through Main Street . Once she had been Ethel 's friend . They had gone to high school together . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing a baby carriage . She was round and plump . She and Ethel had been friends . Now they were acquaintances . They smiled and bowed coldly to each other . Ethel hurried along the street . In Main Street , near the court house , she was joined by Red Oliver . " May I walk with you ? " " Yes . " " Are you going to the library ? " " Yes . " Silence . Thoughts . The young man was hot , like the night . " He 's too young , too young . I do n't want him . " She saw Tom Riddle standing with other men before a store . He had seen her with the boy . The boy had seen him standing there . Thoughts in them . Red Oliver was embarrassed by her silence . He was hurt , afraid . He wanted a woman . He thought he wanted her . Ethel 's thoughts . One night in Chicago . A man ... once in her rooming-house in Chicago ... just an ordinary man ... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... he was living there . " Am I common ? Am I just dirt ? " It was on just such a hot rainy night . He had a room on the same floor of the house on lower Michigan , Avenue . He had been after Ethel . Red Oliver was after her now . He got her . It happened suddenly , unexpectedly . And Tom Riddle. 200 BEYOND DESIREp200She was alone on that floor of the house that night in Chicago and he . .. that other man .. . just a man , a male , nothing more ... and he was there . Ethel had never understood that in herself . She was tired . She had dined that evening in a noisy hot cafeteria , as she thought , among noisy ugly people . Were they ugly or was she ? For the time she was disgusted with herself , disgustedwith her life in the city . She had gone to her room and had not locked her door . That man had seen her go in there . He was sitting in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong . She had gone to her room and had thrown herself on the bed . There were such moments came to her . She did not care what happened . She wanted something to happen . He came boldly in . There had been a short struggle , not at all like the struggle with the advertising man Fred Wells . She surrendered ... let it happen . Afterwards he wanted to do something for her , take her to a theatre , take her to dine . She could not bear seeing him . It had stopped like that , abruptly as it had begun . " I was such a fool to think anythingcould be got at in that way , as though I were just an animal , nothing else , as though I wanted just that . " Ethel went to the library and , unlocking the door , went in . She left Red Oliver at the door . " Good night . Thank you , " she said . She put up two windows , hoping to get a breath of air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , over the desk , leaning over , her head in her hands . It went on a long time , thoughts traveling through her . Night came , a hot dark night . She was nervous , as she had been that night in Chicago , on just such another hot tired night , when she had taken that man she did not know ... it was strange she had n't got into trouble . . . got a child . . . am I just a whore ? ... how many women were as she was , blown about in life as she was ... did a woman need a man , some sort of anchor ? There was Tom Riddle . She thought of life in her father 's house . Now herp20Ifather was upset and uncomfortable about her . There was Blanche . Blanche felt actual enmity toward her husband . There was no frankness . Blanche and her father had both shot and both missed . " If I take a chance with Tom , " Ethel thought . Blanche had taken a certain attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . She dropped little hints about that , knowing Ethel 's love of clothes . Perhaps she merely let herself go as she did , neglecting her own clothes , often not even bothering to be clean , to punish her husband . She would have wormed money out of her husband and would have given it to Ethel . She wanted to . She wanted to touch Ethel with her hands , the hands with dirty fingernails . She approached . " You are lovely , clear , in that dress . " She smiled , a funny cat-like little smile . She made the house unhealthy . It was an unhealthy house . " What would I do to Tom 's house ? " Ethel was tired thinking . " You think and you think and then you do something . Very likely you make a fool of yourself . " It had grown dark in the street outside the library . There was an occasional flash of lightning , lighting up the room in which Ethel sat , the light from the little desk lamp shining on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine . There came occasional peals of thunder . YOUNG Red Oliver had been watching and waiting . He had walked restlessly about . He had wanted to follow Ethel into the library . Once , early in the evening , he opened the street door softly and looked in . He had seen Ethel Long sitting in there , her head in her arm , by her desk . He had become frightened , had gone away , but he had come back . He had been thinking of her for days and for many nights . After all , he was a boy , a nice boy . He was strong and clean . " If I had seen him when I was myself young , if we had been of the same age . " Ethel had thought sometimes . At night , sometimes , when she could not sleep . She had not slept well since she had come back to the Long house . There was something about such a house . Something gets into the air of the house . It is in the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , in the carpets on the floor . It is in the bed clothes , on which you are lying . It hurts . It makes everything gigantic . It is hatred , alive , watching , eager . It is a living thing . It is alive . " Love , " Ethel thought . Would she ever find that ? Sometimes , when she was alone in her room at night , when she could not sleep . . . she thought of young Red Oliver then . " Do I want him like that , just to have him , perhaps to quiet myself , as I had that man in Chicago ? " She was there in her room , lying awake , pitching restlessly about . She saw young Red Oliver sitting at a table in the library . Sometimes his eyes looked hungrily toward her . She was a woman . She could note what went on in him without letting him see what went on in her . He was trying to read a book . He had gone to college in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell a good deal by the books he read . He had become a workman in the mill at Langdon ; perhaps he was trying to get in with other workmen . He might even want to fight their cause , the cause of working people . There were young men like that . They having a dream of a new world , as Ethel herself had had at moments in her life . Tom Riddle not having such a dream . He would have laughed at the idea . " It is pure romanticism , " he would have said . " People are not born equal . Some men are meant to be slaves , some masters . If they are not slaves in one way they will be in another.  | " There are slaves to sex , to what they think is thought , to food , to drink . " What difference does it make ? " Red Oliver would not have been like that . He was young and eager . Men had put ideas into his head . He was n't , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , as Tom Riddle did , wanted Ethel ; he thought he ( lid . She had got fixed in his mind in that way . She knew it . She could tell it by his eyes , looking at her , by his embarrassments . He was innocent , glad and ashamed . He came toward her hesitatingly , confused , wanting to touch her , hold her , kiss her . Blanche came toward her sometimes . Red 's coming , his emotions coming toward her , left Ethel feeling rather nice , a little stirred , often a good deal stirred . At night , when she was restless and could n't sleep , she , in fancy , saw him as she had seen him playing ball . He was running furiously . He had got the ball . His body fell into balance . He was like an animal , like a cat . Or he was standing at hat . He stood poised . There was something in him delicately adjusted , delicately timed . " I want that . Am I just greedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came toward him swiftly . Tom Riddle had explained to Ethel how the ball was made to curve as it approached the ( batsman . Ethel sat up in bed . Something within her ached . " Would it do him harm ? I wonder . " She got a book and tried to read . " No , I will not let it happen . " There were older women , with boys , Ethel had heard . It was odd , the notion many men had , that women were inherentlynice . Some of them at least got ugly , were filled with blind desires . The South , Southern men always being romantic about women ... never giving them a chance really ... getting off patter . Tom Riddle was certainly a relief.  | An the library that night it had happened , suddenly , quickly as it did that time with the strange man in Chicago . It was n't like that . Perhaps Red Oliver had been standing for some time just outside the library door . The library was in an old house , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-Civil War slave-owning family , or to a rich merchant . There was a little flight of steps . The rain that had been threatening all evening came . It was a fierce summer rain accompanied by a high wind . It threshed against the walls of the library building . There were loud peals of thunder and sharp flashes of lightning . It might have been the storm that had affected Ethel that evening . Young Oliver had been waiting for her , just outside the library door . People passing along the street would have seen him standing there . He had thought . . . " I 'll walk home with her . " A young man 's dreams . Red Oliver was a young idealist ; he had in him the making of one . Men like her father began like that . More than once , as she sat that night at her desk , her head in her hands , the young man opened the door softly to look in . He stepped in . The rain drove him in . He had not dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening she had suddenly become again the young girl  --  half girl , half tomboy  --  whohad once gone to a tough little boy in a field . When the door opened , admitting young Red Oliver into the large main room of the library , a room that had been made by tearing out walls , there came with him a heavy gust of rain . Already rain was pouring into the room from the two windows Ethel had opened . She looked up and saw him standing there , in the dim light . At first she could not see distinctly , but at that moment there was a flash of lightning.  |p205She  got up and walked toward him . " So , " she thought . " Shall I ? Yes , I will . " She was living again as she had lived that night when her father had come into the field , when he had suspected her , when he had put his hands on her . " He is not here now , " she thought . She thought of Tom Riddle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make something of me I am not . " She was in rebellion again now , was doing something , not because it was something she wanted but to defy something . Her father . . . and perhaps Tom Riddle too . She walked toward Red Oliver , who stood by the door , a little frightened . " Is there something the matter ? " he asked . " Shall I close the windows ? " She did not answer . " No , " she said . " Am I going to do this ? " she asked herself . " It will be like that man who came to my room in Chicago . No , it will not be like that . I will be the one who does it . " I want to . " She had got quite close to the young man . A queer weaknesscame into her body . She fought it . She put her hands on Red Oliver 's shoulders and let herself half fall forward. , " Please , " she said . She was against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was like that . She could feel the life surging up in him . " Here ? Now ? " He was trembling . " Yes . " The words were n't said . " Here ? Now ? " He understood at last . He could scarcely speak , could n't believe . He thought , " I 'm lucky . How lucky I am ! " His voice was husky . " There is n't any place . It ca n't be here . " " Yes . " Again no need of words . " Shall I close the windows , put out the light ? Some one might see . " The rain was threshing against the walls of the building . The building shook . " Quick , " she said . " I do n't care who sees us , " she said . It had been like that , and then afterwards Ethel had. 2o6 BEYOND DESIREp206driven young Red Oliver away . " You go now , " she said . She was even gentle , wanting to be motherly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She half wanted to cry . " I must drive him away or I will . . . " There was childish gratitude in him . She had looked aside once . .. while it was happening . .. there was something in his face . .. in his eyes ... " If I had only earned this " . . . it had all happened on a table in the library , the table at which he was accustomed to sit , reading his books . He had been there the afternoon before , reading Karl Marx . She had ordered the book especially for him . " I 'll pay for it out of my own pocket if the library board objects , " she had thought . She had looked aside once and there was a man passing in the street , his head thrust forward . He did not look up . " It would be queer , " she thought , " if it was Tom Riddle ... " Or father . " " There is a good deal of Blanche in me , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She wondered if she could ever love well . " I do n't know , " she said to herself as she led Red to the door . She was at once getting tired of him . Ile was saying something about love , protesting awkwardly , persistently , as though not sure , as though he had been rebuffed . He was queerly ashamed . She was silently confused . Already she was sorry for him , for what she had done . " Well , I did it . I wanted to . I did it . " She did not say that aloud . She kissed Red , a cold forbidding little kiss . A story popped into her head , a story some one had told her once . It was about a prostitute who saw somewhere , on a publicstreet , a man who had been with her during the night before . The man bowed and spoke pleasantly to her , and she was angry , indignant and said to a companion , " Did you see that ? Imagine his speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , what right has he to speak to me in the daytime and in the public street ? " Ethel smiled thinking of the story . " I may be a pros/titute myself , " she was thinking . " I am . " Perhaps all women had somewhere , hidden away in themselves , like the marbling in fine meat , a strain of something ... ( desire for complete abandon ? ) " I want to be alone , " she said . " To-night I want to walk home alone . " He went awkwardly out of the door . He was confused ... in some queer way his manhood had been assaulted . She knew that . Now he felt baffled , confused , impotent . How could the woman , after what had happened ... so suddenly . .. after much thinking and hoping and dreaming on his part .. . he had even thought of marriage , of proposing marriage to her ... if he could get up courage . .. what had happened had been her work . . . the boldness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dismiss him like that ? The summer storm that had been threatening all afternoonand that had been so violent was passing quickly . It was perplexing to Ethel but , even at that moment , she knew that she was going to marry Tom Riddle . If he would have her . ETHEL did not know it definitely at that moment , in the moment , after Red had left her , after she had got him out through the door and was alone . There was a sharp little reaction , half shame , half remorse . .. a little flow of thoughts she did n't want . .. they came singly , then in little clusters ... thoughts can be lovely little winged things .. . they can be sharp little stinging things . Thoughts . .. as though a boy had run along the dark night street of Langdon , Georgia , with a handful of little stones . He stopped in the dark street outside the library . The little stones were thrown . They came rattling sharply against a window . Thoughts like that. 208 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and put it on . She was tall . She was slender . She began doing the little trick Tom Riddle did . She straightened her shoulders . Beauty has a queer trick with women . It is a quality . It plays about in the penumbra . It settles suddenly upon them , sometimes when they think they have been most ugly . She turned out the one light , the one over her own desk , and went to stand near the door . " Things pass like that , " she thought . There had been for some weeks this desire in her . The young man , Red Oliver , was nice . He had been half frightened , eager . He had kissed her eagerly with half-frightened hunger , her lips , her neck . It had been nice . It had been notnice . IIe had been convinced by her . He had not been convinced .

" People were perpetually doing it to each other . It was n't just this one thing ... two bodies clasp together trying that . People did harm to each other . Her father had done it to his second wife , Blanche , and in turn now Blanche was trying to do it to her father . What an ugly jam .. . Ethel was mellow now .... There was softness , regret . She wanted to cry . " I wish I were a little girl . " Little memories . She was a little girl again . She saw herself as a little girl . Her own mother was alive . She was with her mother . They were walking in a street . Her mother held the hand of the girl child that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did life do it to me ? " " Now do n't be blaming life . Damn self-pity. "  |p209There  was a tree , in spring wind , in early April wind . The leaves on the tree played . They danced . She was standing in the dark large room of the library , near the door , the door through which young Red Oliver had just disappeared . " My lover ? No ! " Already she had forgottenhim . She stood there thinking of something else . It was very quiet in the street outside . After the rain the Georgia night would be cooler , but it would still be hot . Now the heat would be damp and heavy . Although the rain had passed there were still occasional flashes of lightning , faint flashes , coming from far off now , from the receding storm . She had spoiled her relations with the young Langdon man who had been in love with her , who had had a passionate desire for her . She knew that . It might go out of him now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams of her at night  --  in him . .. hunger . .. wanting ... for her . If , for him , in him , for some other woman , now , presently . Had she also spoiled her relations with the room in which she worked ? A little shudder ran through her and she went quickly outside . It was to be an eventful night in Ethel 's life . When she got outside she thought at first she was alone . At least the chances were that no one would ever know what had happened . Did she care ? She did n't care . She did care . When you are a mess inside , you do n't want any one to know . You straighten your shoulders . Push against it . Push against it . Push . Push . " Everybody doing it . Everybody doing it . " For Christ 's sweet sake be merciful to me , a sinner . " The library building was just off Main Street and at the ' corner of Main Street there was a tall old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hall above . The hall was the meeting place of some lodge and there was an open stairway leading up . Ethel walked along the street and when she came to the stairway she saw a man standing there , half hidden in the darkness . He stepped toward her. 210 BEYOND DESIREp210It was Tom Riddle . He was there standing . He was there coming . " Another ? " I might with him too .. . be a whore , take them all . " Damn . To hell with all of them . " So , " she thought . " He has been watching . " She wondered how much he had seen . If he had come down past the library , during the storm . If he had looked in . It seemed unlike what she thought of him .

" I have no rights over her . I want her . " His own life was n't so nice . He knew . " We might begin . I might learn , even to love . " His own thoughts . The younger man , leaving the library , had passed quite close to him , but had not seen him standing in a hallway . He had drawn himself back . " What right have I prying on her ? She has promised me nothing . " There had been something . There was a light , a street light . He had seen young Red Oliver 's face . It was n't the face of a satisfied lover . It was the face of a puzzled boy . Gladness in the man . A queer not understandable sadness in the man , not for himself , but for the other . " I thought you would be coming along , " he said to Ethel . He was walking along beside her now . He was silent . They walked thus through Main Street and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethel lived . There had come a reaction in Ethel now . She was even frightened . " What a fool I was , what a damn fool ! I'vep211spoiled everything . I have spoiled things with that boy and with this man . " fool , throwing herself away , throwingherself here and there , so that no man will want her . " Now do n't blame that boy . You did it . You did it . " It might be that Tom Riddle had suspected something . It might have been his test of her . She did not want to believe that . There was a way in which this man , this so-called hard-boiled man , obviously a realist , if there could be such a thing among Southern men ... there was a way in which he had already won her respect . If she was to lose him . She did not want to lose him , because  --  out of weariness and perplexity  --  shehad been a fool again . Tom Riddle walked along beside her in silence . Althoughshe was tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the street lights through which they passed she tried to look at his face without his knowing that she was looking , that she was anxious . Did he know ? Was he judging her ? Drops of water from the recent heavy rain kept pattering down from the shade trees under which they walked . They had got through Main Street . It was deserted . There were little pools of water on the sidewalks and water , shining and yellow in the lights from corner street lamps , ran in the gutters . At one place there was no walk . There had been a brick walk but it had been taken up . A new cement walk was to 1w laid . They had to walk in wet sand . A thing happened . " 1'om Riddle started to take Ethel 's arm and then he did n't take it . There was a little hesitant shy movement . It touched something in her . There was a moment ... a little passing thing . " If he , this one , is like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , faint , drifting across her mind . Some man , older than herself , more mature.  | To know that she , like any woman , perhaps like any man , wanted . .. wanted nobility , cleanliness . " If he knew and forgave me , I would hate him . " There has been too much hatred . I do n't want any more . " Could he , this older man ... could he know why she had taken the boy . .. he was a boy really . .. Red Oliver ... and knowing , could he . .. not blame . .. not forgive . .. not think of himself in the impossibly noble position of being one to forgive ? She grew desperate . " I wish I had n't done it . I wish I had n't clone it , " she thought . She tried something . " Were you ever in a certain position ... " she said to Tom Riddle ... " I mean going ahead and doing something you wanted to do and at the same time did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to do . .. and did n't know ? " It was a fool question . She was frightened by her own words . " If he suspects something , if he saw that boy come out of the library , I am only confirming his suspicion . " She was frightened by her own words , but went ahead hurriedly . " There was something you were ashamed of doing , but wanted to do and knew that after you had done it you would be more ashamed . " " Yes , " he said quietly , " a thousand times . I 'm always doing it . " They walked in silence after that until they got to the Long house . He did not try to detain her . She was curiousand excited . " If he knows and can take it like this , really wanting me as his wife , as he says , he is something new in my experience of men . " There was a little warm feeling . " Is it possible ? We are neither of us good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she was identifying herself with him . At table in the Long house , sometimes nowadays , her father spoke of this man , of Tom Riddle . He did not address his remarks to his daughter , but to Blanche . Blanche encouraged it . She mentioned Tom Riddle . " How many loose women has that man had ? " When Blanche asked that she looked upp213quickly at Ethel . " I am only goading him on . He 's just a fool man . I want to see him blow himself up  --  with wind . " Her eyes saying that to Ethel . " We women understand . Men are only foolish windy children . " There would be some such question thrust out , Blanche wanting to put her husband in a certain position in relation to Ethel , wanting a little to bother Ethel .. . there was the fiction carried on that Ethel 's father did not know of the lawyer 's interest in his daughter ....

" There was a chance that , for such men as her father , the good solid men of the town , Tom Riddle had his own kind of contempt ... " as I have , " Ethel thought . Stories told about the man , his bold running about with loose women , his being a Republican , making deals about Federal patronage , handling Negro delegates at national conventionsof the Republican Party , being in with gamblers , horsy men . ..

You ought to know what I know . " Now suddenly she could imagine his saying that , without much bitterness , taking a kind of hypocrisy in the others for granted . .. not being made too sore , too resentful by it . He had said he wanted her as his wife , and dimly she now understood , or suddenly hoped , she was realizing what he had meant .

He had implied , or even said , that , in asking her to marry him , he wanted something definite . He wanted her because he thought she had style . " You are nice . It 's nice walkingbeside a proud fine woman . You say to yourself , she 's mine . ' " It 's nice having her in your house .

" Let 's not be romanticor sentimental . We both want something . I can help you and you can help me . " He had n't used exactly these words . They were implied . If he could feel now , even if he knew what had happened on that evening , if he could feel .... " I have n't got you yet . You are free yet .

She had made another man feel ineffectual , unsuccessful with her , in spite of what had happened . . . in spite of the thing that was presumed to make a man , any man , feel very manly and strong . Now she was feeling ineffectual . At the gate that night Tom Riddle said something . She had been wondering how much he knew . He knew nothing . What had happened in the library had happened during a violent rainstorm . To have seen he would have had to creep through the rain to a window . Now suddenly she remembered that , as they had walked through Main Street , some section of her brain had noted that fact , that the rain-coat he had on was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would creep to a window . " Now wait , " Ethel said to herself that night . " He might even have done that , if he had thought of it , if he had been suspicious , if he had wanted to do it .

" At that it might have been rather a fine test of a man , of a man with this man 's realistic viewpoint on life . .. to have seen that . . . another man and the woman he wanted ... What would he tell himself ? How much figure would what he thought her style , her class , how much figure would it cut then ? " It would have been rather too much . He could n't have stood it . No man could stand it . If I were a man , I would n't . " We go along , hurting , slowly educating ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom Riddle was speaking to Ethel . " Good night . I ca n't help hoping you will decide to do it . I mean ... I 'm waiting . I 'll be waiting . I hope it wo n't be long . " Come any time , " he said . " I 'm ready . " He leaned a little toward her . Was he going to try to kiss her . She wanted to cry out , " Wait . Not yet . I must have time to think . " He did n't . If he had in mind trying to kiss her , he changed his mind . His body straightened itself . There was that queer little gesture in him , a straightening of stooped shoulders , a pushing . .. as though against life itself ... as though to say , " push up . .. push up ... " to himself ... talking to himself ... like herself in that . " Good night , " he said , and walked rapidly away . " IT begins . Will it never end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . There was that queer feeling , immediately she had got inside , that Blanche sensed that it had been an upsetting night for her . Ethel was resentful . " At any rate , she could n't know anything . " 11 " Good night . What I have said goes . " Tom Riddle 's words also in Ethel 's mind . It sounded as though he did know something , suspected something .... " I do n't care . I hardly know whether or not I care , " Ethel thought . " Yes , I would care . If he is to know I 'd rather tell him . " But I am not close enough to him to go tell him things . I do n't want a father confessor . " Perhaps I do . " Evidently it was going to be a night of intensive selfconsciousnessfor her . She went into her room , out of the hallway downstairs , where there was a light burning . It was ( lark upstairs where Blanche now slept . She took off her clothes hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she threw herself on the bed . There was a little light coming into the room , faintly , through a transom . She lit a cigarette but did not smoke . It tasted stale in the darkness and she got out of bed and put it out . It was n't quite out . There was a little pale insistent cigarette stink . " Walk a mile for a Camel . " " Not a cough in a carload . " It was to be a dark soft sticky Southern night after rain . She felt exhausted . " Women . What things they are ! What a thing I am ! " she thought . Was it because she was aware of Blanche , the other woman in that house , now perhaps awake in her room , also thinking . Ethel was herself trying to think her way through something . Her mind had got started . It would n't quit . She was tired and wanting to sleep , wanting to forget the experiencesof the night in sleep , but she knew she could n't sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off , if it had been what she really had wanted . . . . " I might then have slept . I would have been at least a satisfied animal . " Why was she now so suddenly conscious of that other woman in the house , that Blanche ? Nothing to her really , her father 's wife , " his problem , thank God , not mine , " she thought . Why did shep218have the feeling that Blanche was awake , that she also was thinking , that she had been watching for the homecoming , had seen the man , Torn Riddle , at the gate with Ethel ? Her thoughts . . . " Where have they been in this storm ? They are n't driving . " " Damn her and her thoughts , " Ethel said to herself . Blanche would be thinking that Ethel with Tom Riddle might get into some such position , as regards her man , she was herself in . Was there something to be settled with her , as there had been with the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled between herself and Tom Riddle ? " Not to-night anyway , I hope . For God 's sake not to-night . " " It 's the limit . It 's enough . " And anyway what was to be settled as between her and Blanche ? " She is another woman . I am glad of that . " She tried to put Blanche out of her mind . She thought of the men now concerned in her life , of her father , of the young man Red Oliver , of Tom Riddle . Of one thing she could be quite sure . Her father would never be much aware of what was going on about him . He was a man for whom life separated itself into broad lines , the good and the bad . He would make quick judgments always , as he decided cases in court . " You are guilty . You are not guilty . " For that reason , life , actual life , would always baffle him . It must always have done that . People would n't behave as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had got puzzled and confused . He had got personal . " Is she trying to punish me ? Is life trying to punish me ? " This because she , the daughter , had problems her father could n't understand . He had never tried to get understanding . " How the hell does he think it comes to people , if it does come ? Does he think certain people , good people , like himself , are born with it ?  | " What is wrong with my wife , Blanche ? Why does she not behave as she should ? " Now there is my daughter , too . Why is she turning out like this ? " There was her father and there was the young man with whom she had suddenly dared be so intimate without really being intimate at all . She had let him make love to her . She had practically compelled him to make love to her . There was a kind of sweetness in him , even a kind of cleanness . He had not been soiled as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanness , had grabbed at it . " Did I only succeed in soiling him , too ? " I know this . I grabbed , but I did n't get what I grabbed for . " *ETHEL was feverish . It was a night . She was n't through with the night yet . It never rains but it pours . She was lying on the bed in the dark hot room . Her long slender body was stretched out there . There was a tension , little nerves crying out . The little nerves under her knees were taut . She raised her legs and kicked impatiently . She lay still . She sat up stiffly in the bed . The door from the hallway had opened softly . Blanche had come into the room . She advancedhalfway across the room . She was clad in a white night-gown . She whispered , " Ethel . " " Yes . " Ethel 's voice . was harsh . She was startled . In all of the communication between the two women , since Ethel had come home to Langdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a kind of play . It was half play , half something else . The two women had wanted to help each other . Was something else going to happen to Ethel now ? She had a premonition . " Do n't . Do n't . Go away , " she wanted to cry. 220 BEYOND DESIRE " To-night I did something not nice . Now something is going to be done to me . " How did she know that ? Blanche was always wanting to touch her . She always got up late in the morning , after Ethel did . She had strange habits . At night , when Ethel was not at home , she went upstairs to her room early . What did she do up there ? She did not sleep . Sometimes , at two or three in the morning , Ethel was awakened , hearing Blanche prowling about the house . She went to the kitchen and got food . In the morning she heard Ethel preparing to leave the house and came downstairs . She looked untidy . Even her night-gown was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see what you were wearing . " There was that queer passion , always to know what Ethel was wearing . She wanted to give Ethel money to buy clothes . " You know how I am . I do n't care what I wear , " she said . She said it with a little fling of her head . She wanted to approach Ethel , put her hands on her . " That 's nice . It 's lovely on you , " she said . " That cloth is nice . " She put her hands on Ethel 's dress . " You understand what to wear and how to wear it . " When Ethel left the house , Blanche came to the front door . She stood there watchingEthel go off along the street . Now she was in the room where Ethel was lying naked on the bed . She came softly across the room . She had n't even put on bedroom slippers . She was in her bare feet and her feet made no sound . She was like a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ethel . " " Yes . " Ethel wanted to get up quickly and put on her pajamas . " Lie still , Ethel , " Blanche said . " I have been waiting for 3 waiting for you to come . " voice now was not sharp and harsh . A kind of soft --  , crept into it . It was a pleading voice . " There hasbe understanding . We have n't understood each other , "  |p22IBlanche  said . There was a faint light in the room . It came through an open transom from a dim lamp burning in the hallway outside the door . It was the door by which Blanche had entered . Ethel could hear her father snoring in his bed in a nearby room . " It has been a long time . I have waited a long time , " Blanche said . It was queer . Tom Riddle had , just an hour before , said something of the same sort . " I hope it will not be long now , " Tom had said . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sharp bony hand touched Ethel 's shoulder . She had put her hand out , touching Ethel . Ethel had grown rigid . She said nothing . At the touch of the hand her body trembled . " I thought to-night I thought . . . it is to-night or never . I thought something was to be decided , " Blanche said . She spoke in a low soft voice , unlike her voice as Ethel knew it . She spoke as one in a trance . For just a moment Ethel was relieved . " She is walking in her sleep . She is not awake . " The conviction passed quickly . " I have been knowing all evening . There are the two men , the older one and a younger . She will be making up her mind , ' I thought . I wanted to stop it . " I do n't want you to do it . I do n't want you to do it . " She was soft and pleading . Now her hand had begun to caress Ethel . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over her hips . Ethel remained rigid . She felt cold and weak . " It 's coming , " she thought . What was coming ? " You have to decide sometime . You have to be some thing . " You are a whore or you are a woman . . " You have to take responsibility . " There were queer distorted sentences running , Ethel 's mind . It was as though some person , not , 222 BEYOND DESIREp222not young Red Oliver , not Torn Riddle , were whispering to her . " There is a self and another self . " A woman is a woman or she is not a woman . " A man is a man or he is not a man . " More and more sentences running through Ethel 's head , apparently disjointed sentences . It was as though some older , some more sophisticated and evil thing , like another person , had come into her , had come in with the touch of Blanche 's hand . . . . The hand continued creeping up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips . . . . " It can be sweet , " a voice said . " It can be very very sweet . " There was a snake in Eden . " Do you like snakes ? " Thoughts in Ethel , racing thoughts , thoughts she had never had before . " There is this thing we call individuality in us . It is a disease . I have thought , I must save myself . ' That is what I have been thinking . I have always been thinking that . " Once I was a young girl , " Ethel thought suddenly . " I wonder if I was nice , if I was born nice . " Was I intended to be something , a woman perhaps ? " There was a queer dawning notion of womanhood , somethingeven noble , something patient , something understanding . What a mess life could get into ! Every one saying to some one , " Save me . Save me . " Sex twisting people . It had twisted Ethel . She knew it . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blanche said in her strange new soft voice . " I do n't know why but I am sure . " " They wo n't do . They wo n't do . " I hate them . " I hate them . " They spoil everything . I hate them . " Now she had put her face down close to Ethel 's face.  | " We let them . We even go toward them . " There is something in them we think we want . " " Ethel . Do n't you understand ? I love you . I have tried to make you know . " Blanche had put her face down close to Ethel 's . For a time she was still there . Ethel could feel the woman 's breath on her cheek . The minutes passed . There was an interval that , to Ethel , seemed hours . Blanche 's lips touched Ethel 's shoulders . IT was enough . With a kind of spasmodic movement , a twist of her body , throwing the woman off , Ethel sprang out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew how long it went on . She knew it was the end of something , the beginning of something . She was fighting for something . When she sprang , twisted herself out of bed , out of Blanche 's arms , and stood on her feet , Blanche sprang at her again . Ethel stood erect beside the bed and Blanche threw herself at her feet . She threw her arms about Ethel 's body , clung desperately there . Ethel was dragging her across the room . The two women had begun to wrestle . How strong Blanche was ! Now her lips were kissing Ethel 's body , her thighs , her legs ! The kisses did not touch Ethel . It was as though she were a tree and some strange bird with a long sharp bill was pecking away at her , at some outer part of her . She was not sorry for Blanche now . She herself had become cruel . She had got one of her hands into Blanche 's hair and was pulling the face and lips away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also strong . Slowly she forced Blanche 's head away from herself . " Never . Never that , " she said.  | She did not say the words aloud . Even then , at that moment , she was conscious of the fact that she did not want her father to know what was going on in his house . " I would n't want to hurt him like that . " Here was something she would never want any man to know . Now it would be comparatively easy for her to tell Tom Riddle about Red Oliver . .. if she decided she wanted Tom Riddle for her man . . . what she had thought she had wanted of the younger man , the experiment she had made , its failure . " No ! No ! " " Blanche ! Blanche ! " It was necessary to bring Blanche back out of the place into which she had got . l f Blanche had made a mess of her life it was her own mess . She had a desire not to betray Blanche . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sudden wrench she turned Blanche 's face up to her own and with her free hand struck her in the face . She kept striking . With all her strength she struck . She remembered something she had heard sometime , somewhere . " If you are a swimmer and have gone to rescue a drowning man or woman if he resists or struggles , strike him . Knock him unconscious . " She struck and struck . Now she was dragging Blanche toward the door of the room . It was odd . Blanche did not seem to mind being struck . She seemed to like it . She did not try to turn her face away from the blows . Ethel had wrenched the door to the hallway open and had got Blanche outside and into the hallway . With a final effort she freed herself from the body clinging to her body . Blanche fell to the floor . There was a look in her eyes . " Well , I am licked . Anyway I tried . " She had got back the thing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own room and closed and bolted the door . Inside the door she stood with one hand on the knob , the other hand resting on a door panel . She was weak . She listened . Her father had awakened . She heard him get out of his bed . He was fumbling for a light . He was getting to be an old man . He stumbled against a chair . His voice was quavering . " Ethel ! Blanche ! What has happened ? " " It will go on now like that in this house , " thought Ethel . " At least I will not be here . " " Ethel ! Blanche ! What has happened ? " The voice of her father was the voice of a scared child . He was getting old . His voice trembled . He was getting old and he had never grown up . He had always been a child , would be a child to the end . " It might be why women could so hate and detest men . " There was a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great God , " she thought . The voice was as it had always been when Blanche addressed her husband . It was sharp , a little hard , clear . " Nothing has happened , dear , " the voice said . " I was in Ethel 's room . We were talking in there . " " Go back to sleep , " the voice said . There was something terrible in the command . Ethel heard her father 's voice . He was grumbling . " I wish you would not wake me up , " the voice said . Ethel heard him getting heavily back into bed.  |p225IT  was early morning . The room in the Long house in which Ethel lived had a window looking out toward the field her father owned , the field that sloped down to a creek , the field into which she had gone as a young girl to meet a bad little boy .

It was strange for him to come back to Ethel , that summer morning in Georgia , after the night , after the sleepless night , after the adventure with Red Oliver , after Blanche . He came into her room and sat down . How absurd ! It was only the memory of him that came . That 's nice . If you are a woman , the memory of a man can come right into your room as you sit dressing . You are quite naked . What ? What difference does it make ! " Come in , sit down . Touch me . Do n't touch me . Thoughts , touch me . " Suppose the man is a nut . Suppose he is a middle-aged , bald-headed man . Ethel saw that one once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked him . He talked crazily . Well . Was he drunk ? Could anything be crazier than the Long house in Langdon , Georgia ? People might go past the house along a street . How would they know it was a crazy house ? The man in Chicago . Again Ethel was with Harold Grey . You go through life gathering up people . You are a woman and are with a man a good deal . Then you are n't with him any more . So there he is , just the same , a part of you . He touched you . He walked beside you . You liked him or did n't like him . You were cruel to him . You 're sorry . His color in you , a little , your color in him . In Chi Yo . at a party , a man talking . It was at another evening pal the house of one of Harold Grey 's friends .

" So , I guess every one wants God . " Some one at table , at dinner , had spoken of Henry Adams , another historian , Mont Saint Michel and Chartres . " White soul of the Middle Ages . " Historians talking . Every one wants God . A man talked to two women . He was eager , nice . " We have been a lot of fools , we men of the Western world .

He was trying to explain something , that he thought thereligion the Greeks and Romans had , before Christianitycame , was nicer than Christianity because it was more earthy .

" When out of Palos came the gold To storm the gates of Hercules . " Was that right ? He tried to imagine gods there . He tried to be a Greek . " I fail , " he said , " but it 's fun trying . " There was a long tale told . The man was describing to two women , trying to describe , how he lived . He painted and then he could n't paint , he said . He went to walk . There was a small creek and bushes growing at the edge of the creek . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He laughed . " There may be a wind blowing . It blows in bushes . " I try to convince myself it is n't a wind . It is a god or a goddess . " It is a goddess . She has come out of the creek . The creek is nice just there . There is a deep hole . " There is a low hill . " She comes out of the creek , dripping wet . She comes up out of the creek . I have to imagine it . I stand with my eyes closed . The water makes shining spots on her skin . " Her skin is lovely . Every painter wants to paint a nude ... against trees , against bushes , against grass . She comes up and pushes through the bushes . It is n't she . It 's a wind blowing . " It is she . There you are . " That was all Ethel remembered . The man might just have been playing with the two women . lie might have been drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house of the historian . Some one came and spoke to her and she did not hear any more . The morning , after the strange mixed-up night in Langdon , Georgia , it might just have come back to her becausethe man had spoken of bushes . On that morning , whenp230she stood by a window and looked out she saw a field . She saw bushes growing by a creek . The rain of the night had made the bushes bright green . IT was early morning , a hot still morning in Langdon . AlreadyNegro men and women , with their children , were at work in the cotton fields near town . The factory workers of the day shift , in the Langdon cotton mill , had been at work for an hour . A wagon with two mules hitched to it went along the road past Judge Long 's house . The wagon creaked dismally . Three Negro men and two women rode a wagon . The street was not paved . The feet of the mules went softly , nicely in the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill , Red Oliver was distraught and upset . Something had happened to him . He had thought he was in love . For many nights he had been lying in his own bed in the Oliver house dreaming of a certain event . " If that would happen , if it could happen . If she ... " It wo n't , it ca n't happen . " I am too young for her . She does n't want me . " There is n't any use my thinking of it . " He had thought of the woman , Ethel Long , as older , wiser , more sophisticatedthan any woman he had ever seen . She must have liked him . Why had she done what she had done ? She had let it happen there , in the library in the dark . He had never thought it would happen . Even then , at the moment . . . if she had not been bold . It had n't been anything she said . She had let him know , in some quick subtle way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was awkward . If I had n't been so damned awkward . I acted as though I did n't believe it , could n't believe it . " Afterwards he had felt more restless than before . Ile had n't been able to sleep . The way in which , after it hap/pened , she had dismissed him . She had made him feel , not like a man but like a boy . He had been angry , hurt , perplexed . After he had left her he had walked about alone for a long time , wanting to curse . There were the letters he had been receiving from his friend Neil Bradley , the Western farmer 's son , who was now in love with a school teacher out there , the things that happened to them . The letters had kept coming that summer . They might have had something to do with the state into which Red had got . A man tells another man , " I 've got me something nice . " He starts thoughts . Thoughts get started . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to a man so much younger than herself , taking him and not takinghim , even using him .. . As though to try out something for herself . " I 'll see if this suits me , if this is what I want . " Could a person live like that , thinking only , " Do I want it ? Will it be good for me ? " Another person involved in it . Red Oliver had tramped about alone in the dark of the hot Southern night after the rain . He went out past the Long house . The house was away out , near the edge of town . There were no pavements out there . He had got off the sidewalk , not wanting to make any noise and had walked in the road , in the mud of the road . He had stood before the house . A stray dog came along . The dog approached and then ran away . There was a street light , nearly a block away . The dog ran to the street light and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had guts . " Suppose he could go to the door and knock . " I want to see Ethel Long . " You come out here . I 'm not through with you yet . " If a man could be a man . "  |p232Red  had stood there the road thinking of the woman he had been with , with whom he had been so intimate withoutbeing at all intimate . Could it be that the woman had come home and had gone quietly to sleep , after that , after she had dismissed him ? The thought had angered him and he walked away swearing . All that night and all the next day as he tried to do his work he swung back and forth . He blamed himself for what had happened and then his mood changed . He blamed the woman . " She is older than I am . She should have known what she wanted . " In the early morning , just at daybreak , he had got out of bed . He wrote Ethel a long letter that was never sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had given him . He wrote the letter and then tore it up and wrote another . The second letter expressed nothing but love and longing . He took all the blame on himself . " It was in some way not nice . It was my fault . Please let me come to you again . Please . Please . Let 's try once more . " He also tore that letter up . In the Long house there was no formal breakfast . The judge 's new wife had done away with that . In the morning , breakfast was taken about to the rooms on trays . A colored woman , a tall woman with big hands and feet and with thick lips , brought Ethel 's breakfast that morning . There was fruit juice in a glass and coffee and toast . Ethel 's father would have had hot bread . He would have demanded hot bread . He took a sincere interest in food , was always talking about it , as though to say , " I take my stand . Here I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stand . " He kept talking about the coffee . " It is n't good . Why ca n't I have good coffee ? " When he went out to dinner , to the Rotary Club , he came home and spoke of it . " We had good coffee , " he said . " We had wonderful coffee . " The bathroom in the Long house was on the ground floor , near Ethel 's room , and that morning she had been upP233and in the bath at six . She took it cold . It was nice . She plunged in . It was n't cold enough . Her father was already up . He was one of the sort of men who can not sleep after daylight comes . It comes very early in Georgia in summer . " I have to have the early morningair , " he said . " It 's the best time of the day to get out and breathe . " He got out of bed and tiptoed about the house . He went out of the house . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milked . A colored man came at an early hour . He got the cow out of the field , the field near the house , the field to which the judge had once gone in anger seeking his daughter Ethel , that time she went there to meet the boy . He had n't seen the boy but was sure he was there . He had always thought that . " But what 's the use thinking ? What 's the use trying to make anything out of women ? " He could talk to the man who had brought the cow . A cow he had owned two or three years before had got a disease called " hollow tail . " There was n't any veterinary in Langdon and the colored man said the tail would have to be cut open . He explained . " You cut the tail open lengthwise . Then you put in salt and pepper . " Judge Long laughed but he let the man do it . The cow died . Now he had got another cow , a half Jersey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would it be better to breed her to a Jersey bull or to some other sort ? There was a man , a half mile in the country , who had a fine Holstein bull . The colored man thought he would be a better bull . " The Holsteins give more milk , " he said . It made something to talk about . It was homey and nice talking to the colored man about something of the sort in the morning . A boy came bringing the Atlanta Constitution and threw it on the porch . He ran across the judge 's lawn , having left his bicycle at the fence , and then he threw the paper . It had been folded and fell with a thump . The judge went to get it and , putting on his glasses , sat on the porch reading .   It was nice in the yard thus , in the early morning , neither of the judge 's perplexing women about , only the colored man there . The colored man , who milked and cared for the cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the winter he brought wood for the fireplaces in the house and in the summer he mowed and sprinkled the lawn and the flower beds . He worked about the flower beds in the yard , the judge watching and giving directions . Judge Long was passionately devoted to flowers and to flowering bushes . He knew about such things . When he had been a younger man he had made a study of birds and knew hundreds of birds by sight and by their songs . Only one of his children had been interested . It was the son who was killed in the World War . His wife Blanche never seemed to see birds and she did not seem to see flowers . She would n't have noticed if they had all been suddenly destroyed . He had manure brought and put about the roots of the bushes . He got the hose and watered the bushes , the flowers and the grass as the colored man pottered about . They talked . It was nice . The judge had no men friends . If the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of that . The two men saw and felt things in the same way . To the judge the bushes and flowers and the grass were living things . " He wants a drink , too , " the colored man said , pointing at a particular bush . He made some of the bushes masculine , some feminine , as the fancy struck him . " Give her a little drop , Judge . " The judge laughed . He liked it . " A little for him now . " The judge 's wife , Blanche , never got out of bed before noon . After she had married the judge , she got the habit of lying in bed in the morning and smoking cigarettes . The habit shocked him . She told Ethel that , before she married , she had smoked in secret . " I used to sit in my room smoking late at night and I blew the smoke out the window , " she said . " In the winter I blew it into the fireplace . I used to lieP235on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare let any one know , least of all your father , who was on the school board . Every one thought I was a nice woman then . " Blanche had burned any number of holes in the bed cover of her bed . She did n't care . " To hell with the bed covers , " she thought . She did not read . In the morning she stayed in bed , smoking cigarettes and staring out a window at the sky . After marriage and after her husband found out about her smoking , she made a concession . She quit smokingin his presence . " I would n't do that , Blanche , " he had said , rather pleadingly . " Why ? " " People will talk . They wo n't understand . " " Wo n't understand what ? " " Wo n't understand that you are a nice woman . " " I 'm not , " she had said brusquely . She had enjoyed telling Ethel how she had fooled the town and her husband , Ethel 's father . Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , as a younger woman , or as a young girl . " It 's all a lie , the picture she makes of herself as she was , " Ethel thought . She might even have been nice , quite nice , quite jolly and alive . Ethel saw , in fancy , a young blonde woman , slender and pretty , alive , rather daringand unscrupulous . " She would have been then terribly eager , as I was myself , ready to take a chance . Nothing offered that she wanted . " She had got her eye on the judge . " What am I to do , go on forever being a school teacher ? " she would have asked herself . The judge was on the county school board . She had met him at some function . Once a year one of the civic clubs of the town , either the Rotary or the Kiwanis Club , gave a dinner for all the white school teachers . She would have got her eye on the judge . His wife was dead . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work on another . You keep telling an older man how young he looks ... not too often but you slip it in . " You are nothing but a boy . You need some one to care for you . " It works all right . She had written the judge a very sympathetic letter when his son died . They began seeing each other in secret . He was lonely . Without a doubt there was something between Ethel and Blanche . It concerned men . It is between all women . Blanche had gone too far . She had been a fool . Just the same there had been something about the scene in the room , on the night before Ethel left her father 's house for good , that was pathetic . It had been Blanche 's determination , a kind of insane determination . " I am going to have something . I am not going to be absolutely robbed . " I am going to have you . " IF Ethel 's father had come into the room at that moment , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . Blanche getting to her feet . She would n't have cared . Even though daylight came very early in the summer in Langdon , Ethel had plenty of time to think before daylightcame , that night when she decided to leave that house . Her father , as usual , had got up early . He was sitting on the front porch of his house , reading his newspaper . There was a colored cook in the house , the wife of the yard man . She carried the judge 's breakfast around the house and put it on a little table beside him . This was his time of the day . The two colored people hung about . The judge made little comments on the news . It was the year 1930 . The paper was full of the industrial depression that had come on duringthe fall before . " I never bought a share of any kind of stock in my life , " Ethel 's father said aloud . " Nor I , " the Negro yard man said , and the judge laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about buying stocks . " Nor I. " It was a joke . The judge gave the Negro manp237advice . " Well , you let it alone . " His tone was serious .. . mockingly serious . " Do n't you go buying stocks on margin , now will you ? " " No sah , no sah , I jes won ' do dat , Jedge . " There was the little chuckling laughter of Ethel 's father , playing with the colored man , his friend really . The two old colored people were sorry for the judge . He had got caught . There was no way for him to escape . They knew that . Negroes might be naive but they were n't fools . The Negro man knew well enough he was amusing the judge . Ethel knew something , too . She ate her breakfast slowly that morning and dressed slowly . There was a huge closet in the room she occupied , and her trunks were in there . They had been put in the closet when she came home from Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in the day , " she thought . There was no use saying anything to her father . She had made up her mind what she was going to do . She was going to try a marriage with Tom Riddle . " I guess I will . If he is still willing , I guess I will . " It was a queer comfortable feeling . " I do n't care , " she told herself . " I 'll even tell him about last night in the library . I 'll see if he 'll stand that . If he wo n't ... I 'll attend to that when I come to it . " That 's the way . Tend to things as you come to them . ' " I may , and I may not . " She went about her room being very particular about her costume . " What about this hat ? It 's a hit out of shape . " She put it on and studied herself in the glass . " I look pretty good . I do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . It was rather flaming but it did something nice to her face . It emphasized the dark olive tones in her skin . " The cheeks want a bit of color , " she thought . Ordinarily , after such a night as she had been through , she would have looked worn-out , but that morning she did n't .   The fact surprised her . She kept being surprised at herself . " What queer moods I have been in , " she told herself as she went about her room . After the cook came in with her breakfast on a tray , she bolted the door . Would the woman Blanche be fool enough to come downstairs and say something about the occurrence of the night before , try to explain or apologize ? Suppose Blanche should try to do that . It would spoil everything . " No , " Ethel told herself . " She has too much sense , too much real nerve for that . She is n't that sort . " It was a nice feeling , almost liking Blanche . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ethel thought . She elaborated the thought a little . It explained a lot in life . " Let every one be what lie is . If a man wants to think he is good ( she was thinking of her father ) , let him think so . People may even think they are Christians , if it does them any good , if it comforts them any . " The thought was a comfort . She arranged and rearrangedher hair . There was a little , tight-fitting red hat that went with the dress she had put on . She heightened the color in her cheeks a bit and then her lips . " If it ca n't be the feeling I had for that boy , that kind of hungry longing , rather senseless , such as animals have , perhaps it can be something else . " Tom Riddle was a true realist , even a courageous one . " We are a good deal alike at bottom . " How nice it had been of him to keep his self-respect all during his courtship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on her senses . He had been frank . " We might be able to hit it off , " Ethel thought . It would be a gamble . He would know it was a gamble . She remembered with gratitude the older man 's words ... " You may not be able to love me . I do n't know what love is . I am no youngster . No one ever called me a handsome man . " " I 'll tell him whatever comes into my head to tell , whatever I think he would like to know . If he wants me , he can take me to-day . I do n't want to wait . We 'll begin . " P239Was she sure of him ? " I 'll try to do a good job for him . I think I know what he wants . " She could hear her father 's voice , talking to the Negro yard man on the front porch . She felt resentment and at the same time pity . " If I could say something to him before I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he heard the news of her suddenmarriage ... if Tom Riddle still wanted to marry her . " He will want it . He will . He will . " She thought again of young Oliver and of what she had done to him , trying him out as she had , to see if he , rather than Tom Riddle , was what she wanted . A little vicious thought came . From her bedroom window she could see into the cow pasture where her father had come seeking her that night , when she was a young girl . The pasture went down to a creek and there were bushes growing along the creek . That boy that time had got away into the bushes . It would have been an odd thing if , on the night before , she had taken young Oliver in there , into the pasture . " If the night had been fair , I might have done that , " she thought . She smiled , a little revengefully , softly . " He will be all right for some woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have done . He may have got educated  --  a little . Anyway , I did it . " It was queer and baffling , trying to find out what was education , what was good and what was bad . She rememberedsuddenly a thing that had happened in the town when she was a young girl . She was on the street with her father . There was a Negro being tried . He had been accused of raping a white woman . The white woman , as it turned out later , was no good . She came into town and accused the Negro . Afterwardshe was cleared . He had been with some man at work on a road at the very hour when she said it happened . That had n't been known at first . There was excitement and talk of a lynching . Ethel 's father was excited . A group of armed deputy sheriffs were standing near the county jail . P240There was another group of men in the street , in front of a drug store . Tom Riddle was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merchant of the town . " Are you going to do it , Tom Riddle , are you going to take that man 's case ? Are you going to defend him ? " " Yes , and clear him too . " " Well ... You . . . You ... " The man was excited . " He was n't guilty , " Tom Riddle said . " If he was guilty , I would still take his case . I would still defend him . " As for you ... " Ethel remembered the look on Torn Riddle 's face . He had stepped out in front of the man , the merchant . The little group of men standing about , became silent . Had she loved Tom Riddle at that moment ? What was love ? " As for you , what I know about you , " Tom Riddle said to that man , " if I ever get you into court . " That was all . It had been nice , one man standing out against a group of men , daring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out of her room . All was quiet in the house . Suddenly her heart beat heavily . " So I am leaving this house . " If Tom Riddle does n't want me , when he knows allabout me , if he does n't want me ... " At first she did not see Blanche , who had come downstairs and was in one of the rooms on the ground floor . Blanche stepped forth . She was n't dressed . She was in a suit of soiled pajamas . She stepped across the little hallway to Ethel . " You look swell , " she said . " I hope it will be a good day for you . " She stood aside as Ethel went out of the house and down the two or three steps from the porch to the walk leading to the gate . Blanche stood just inside the house , looking , and Judge Long , who was still reading his morning paper , put it down and also looked .   " Good morning , " he said , and " Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . She would go into Ethel 's room . She would see Ethel 's bags and her trunks . She would understand but would say nothing to the judge , her husband . She would creep back upstairs and get into bed . She would lie in her bed , looking out at a window and smoking cigarettes. *Tom RIDDLE was nervous and excited . " She was with that boy last night . They were together there in the library . It was dark in there . " He grew a little angry with himself . " Well , I 'm not accusing her . Who am I to accuse her ? " If she wants me , I guess she 'll tell me . I do n't believe she can want him , that boy , not for keeps . " He was nervous and excited as he always was when he thought of Ethel , and went early to his office . He closed his office door and walked up and down . He smoked cigarettes . Many times that summer , as he stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom had watched Ethel , going to the library . He got excited , seeing her . He became a boy in his eagerness . On that morning he saw her . She was crossing the street . She was lost from sight . He stood near a window . There was the sound of feet on the stairs that led up to his office . Could it be Ethel ? Had she made up her mind ? Was she coming to him ? " Keep still .... Do n't be a fool , " he said to himself . There was the sound of feet on the stairs . They stopped . They came forward again . An outer door to his office opened . Tom Riddle braced himself . He stood there trembling while the door into his inner office opened , and there was Ethel , a little pale , with a queer determined look in her eyes . Tom Riddle had grown calm . " A woman who is about to give herself to a man does not come to him like this , " he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You have come up here ? " " Yes . " There were the two people facing each other . People do not arrange a marriage in that way , in a lawyer 's office , in the morning . .. the woman coming to the man . " Can it be like this ? " Ethel was asking herself . " Can it be like this ? " Tom Riddle asked himself . " Not even a kiss . I 've never touched her . " The man and woman stood there , facing each other . There were the sounds of a town coming up from the street , a town getting into its daily , rather meaningless , activities . The office was above a store . It was a simple office with one large room , a large flat-topped desk and law books in cases against the walls . There was a bare floor . There was a sound from below . A clerk in a store dropped a box on the floor . " Well , " Ethel said . She said it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . .. You said you were ready .. . any time . You said it was O. K. with you . " She was finding it hard , hard . " I 'm going to be a damn fool , " she thought . She wanted to cry . " I 'd have to tell you a lot of things ... " " I bet he wo n't have me , " she thought . " Wait , " she said hurriedly , " I 'm not what you think I am . I have to tell you . I must . I must . " " Nonsense , " he said , stepping toward her and taking her hand . " Hell , " he said , " Let it go . What 's the use talking ? " He stood and looked at her . " Dare I , dare I try it , dare I try taking her into my arms ? " Anyway , she knew she liked him , standing there , hesitantand uncertain , like that . " He 's going to marry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , at the moment , think beyond that .   ... she had lost some of her upright proud beauty and had become humble . This woman would be glad for love  --  any love that came to her . Her eyes were saying that now . It was Ethel Long , no longer fighting against life , not even wanting to be victorious in life . Look ... even her gown has changed as she walks across the sunlit field toward Red . Dreams . Does a man in dreams always know he is in dreams ? Now the woman in the field was in an old worn calico dress . Her face looked worn . She was a farm woman , a work woman , merely walking across the field to milk a cow . There were two small boards laid on the ground under some bushes , and Red Oliver was lying on the boards . His body ached and he was cold . It was November and he was in a field covered with bushes near the town of Birchfield , in North Carolina . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush on the two boards laid on the ground , and the bed he had made for himself with the two boards , found near by , was uncomfortable . It was late at night and he sat up rubbing his eyes . What was the use of trying to sleep ? " Why am I here ? Where am I ? What am I doing here ? " Life is unaccountably strange . Why did a man like himself get into such a place ? Why was he always letting himself do unaccountable things ? Red had come out of the half sleep in confusion and so , first of all , when he awoke , he had to gather himself together . There was the physical fact of himself  --  a young man strong enough ... a night 's sleep did not matter so much to him . He was in this new place . How had he got there ? Memories and impressions came floating back . He sat upright . A woman , older than himself , a tall woman , a workingwoman , a farm woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Georgia , had brought him to the spot where he had been lying on the two boards and trying to sleep . He sat up and rubbed his eyes . There was a small treep247near by and he crept over sandy ground to it . He sat on the ground with his back against a little tree trunk . It was like the boards on which he had tried to sleep . The trunk of the tree was rough . If there had been but one board , a broad smooth one , he might have gone on sleeping . He had got one of his nether cheeks down between the two boards and had got pinched . He half leaned over and rubbed the hurt place . He leaned his back against the little tree . The woman with whom he had come to that place had given him a blanket . She had brought it to him from a little tent some distance away and it was worn thin . " I suppose they have n't much bedding , these people , " he thought . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was tall like Ethel Long , but was n't much like her . As a woman she had none of Ethel 's style . Red was glad to be awake . " It will be more comfortable sitting here than trying to sleep on such a bed , " he thought . He was sitting on the ground and the ground was damp and cold . He crept over and got one of the boards . " Anyway , it will make a seat , " he thought . He looked up at the sky . A half moon was out and there were drifting gray clouds . Red was in a camp of striking workers in a field near the town of Birchfield , North Carolina . It was a moonlit night in November and rather cold . By what a queer chain of circumstances he had got there . He had come to the camp in the dark on the evening before with a woman who had brought him into the placeand had left him . They had arrived afoot , tramping afootover hills  --  over half mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths that climbed up over hills and went alongedges of fenced fields . They had come several miles thus inthe gray of the evening and in the darkness of early night . It was for Red Oliver a night when everything abouthim was unreal . There had been other times like that in his life . Of a sudden he began to remember other unreal times . To every man and every boy such times come . There the boy is . He is a boy in a house . The house is suddenly unreal . He is in a room . Everything in the room is unreal . There are , in the room , chairs , a chest of drawers , the bed on which he has been lying . Why do they all seem suddenly strange ? Questions asked . " Is this the house in which I have been living ? Is this strange room in which I now find myself the room in which I slept last night and the night before ? " Every one knows such times of strangeness . Do we controlour own acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask ! We do not . We are all stupid . Will the day ever come when we will shake off this stupidity ? To know even a little of inanimate life , too . There is that chair there . .. that table . The chair is like a woman . Many men have sat in it . They have thrown themselves into it , sat down softly , gently . Men have sat in it thinking and suffering . The chair is old now . There is an aroma of many people hanging over it . Thoughts coming swift and strange . The imagination of a man or boy must sleep most of the time . It suddenly goes on a spree . Why , for example , should any man ever want to be a poet ? What is gained by that ? It would be best to go through life just being a commonman , going along , eating and sleeping . The poet wants to tear things , to tear the veil that separates him from the unknown . He wants to look far out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something out there he would like to understand . Words that men use every day can perhaps be given a new meaning , thoughts given a new meaning . He has let himself run out into the unknown . Now he would like to run back , into a familiar everyday world , carrying back with him into that world something , a sound , a word out of the unknowninto the familiar . Why ? Thoughts grouping themselves in the mind of a man orP249boy . What is this thing called the mind ? It gets out-of-hand , playing the deuce with a man or boy . Red Oliver , in a strange cold place at night , thought dimly of his own boyhood . When he was a boy he went sometimes with his mother to Sunday school . He thought of that . He thought of a story heard there . There was a man called Jesus , in a garden with his followers about him , the followers lying on the ground asleep . Perhaps followers always sleep . The man was suffering in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him and crucify him . Why ? " What have I done that I should be taken to be crucified ? Why am I here ? " Fear coming . A man , a Sunday-school teacher , was trying to tell the story of the man 's night in the garden to the children in a Sunday-school class . Why had memories of that come back to Red Oliver sitting with his back against a tree in a field ? He had come to that place with a woman , a strange woman , met almost casually . They had walked in moonlit places , through upland fields and in and out of dark stretches of forest . The woman Red was with had stopped now and then to speak to him . She had got tired during the walk , not being strong . She had talked to Red Oliver a little , but there had been a shyness between them . That , as they came along in the darkness , gradually passed off . It had n't passed completely , Red thought . The conversation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the path . " Look out . There 's a rut there . You will stumble . " She called the root of the tree that protruded into the path a " rut . " She was taking it for granted that she knew about Red Oliver . He was to her a definite thing she knew about . He was a young communist , a leader of labor , going to a town where there was labor trouble and she was herself one of the laborers in trouble .   Red was ashamed that he had not stopped her along the way , that he had n't told her  --  " I 'm not what you think I am . " " Perhaps I would like to be the thing you think I am . I do n't know . Anyway , I 'm not , " If the thing you think I am is something brave and fine , then I would like to be it . " I want that : to be something brave and fine . There is too much ugliness in life and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't told her . She had thought she knew about him . She had kept asking him , " Are you tired ? Are you getting tired ? " " No . " As they had come along , he had pressed close to her . They were going through dark places along the way and she had stopped to breathe . When they had climbed up steep places in the path he had insisted on pushing ahead and had put out a hand to her . There was enough moonlight to sec her form dimly below . " She is a good deal like Ethel Long , " he kept thinking . She had seemed most like Ethel when he was following her in the paths , she striding along ahead . Then he ran in front of her to help her up a steep place . " They will never get you coming this way , " she said . " They do n't know about this path . " She thought he was a dangerous man , a communist , come into her country to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand pulled her up the steep place . There was a resting place and they both stopped . He stood looking at her . Now she was thin and pale and worn-looking . " Now you are n't much like Ethel Long , " he thought . The darkness of the woods and fields had helped the shyness between them . They had arrived together at the place where Red was now . Red had got into the camp unnoticed . Although it was late at night , he could hear little sounds . A man or a woman stirred somewhere near by or a child whimpered . There was a particular little sound . Some woman among the strikingp251workers he had got in with had a nursing child . The child had stirred uneasily in sleep and the woman had put it to the breast . He could even hear the baby 's lips , sucking and pulling at a woman 's paps . A man , some distance away , crawled out through the door of a small shack made of board and , getting to his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young man , a young worker . Red pressed his body against the trunk of the little tree , not wanting to be seen , and the man went softly away . In the distance there was a somewhat larger shack with a light . The sound of voices came from the little building . The man Red had seen stretching went toward the light . The camp into which Red had come reminded him of something . It was on a gently sloping hillside that had been covered with bushes , but some of the bushes had been cut away . There was a little open place with shacks , like dog houses stuck up . There were a few tents . It was like places Red had seen before . In the South , in Red 's own country , in Georgia , there were such places set up sometimes in a field at the edge of a town or in the country at the edge of a pine forest . The places were called camp meetings and people came there to worship . They got religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with his father , the country doctor , and once , when they were driving on a country road at night , they had come upon such a place . There had been something in the air of the place , that night , that Red remembered now . Lie remembered his own wonder and the contempt of his father . The people were religious enthusiasts , his father had said . Iris father had n't explained much , not being a talkative man . Still Red had understood , had sensed what was going on . Poor people of the South , religious enthusiasts , Methodistsand Baptists for the most part , gathered in such places . They were poor whites from nearby farms . They had put up little tents and shacks as in the camp of strikers to which Red had now come . Such a religious meeting , in the South , among the poor whites , was carried on sometimes for weeks or even months . People came and went . They brought food from their houses . There was an in-flocking . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms or at night from a mill village . They dressed in their best clothes and came afoot along the red Georgia roads at evening , young men and women walking together , older men with their wives , women with babes in their arms and sometimes men leading children by the hand . There they were at the camp meeting at night . There was preaching going on day and night . There were long prayers said . There was singing . The poor whites worshipped thus sometimes in the South and so also did the Negroes but they did n't do it together . In the white camps , as in the ' Negro camps , as the nights grew late , there was intense excitement . There was preaching going on out of doors under the stars . Quavering voices arose in song . People suddenly got religion . Men and women became excited . Sometimes a woman , often a young woman , began to shout and scream . " God . God . Give me God , " she cried . Or , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " It 's Jesus . I can feel his hands touching me . " I can feel his face touching me . " Women , often young unmarried women , came to such meetings and sometimes grew hysterical . There would be a young white woman , the daughter of some poor white tenant farmer of the South . All of her life she had been shy and afraid of people . She was a little starved thing , physically and emotionally starved , but now at the meeting something happened to her . She had come with her own people . It was night and she had been working all that day in a cotton field or in the cotton mill in the nearby town . There had been for her thatp253day ten , twelve or even fifteen hours of hard labor in the mill or in a field . Now there she was at the camp meeting . She could hear the voice of a man , the preacher , shoutingunder the stars or under trees . The woman sat , a little thin , half-starved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and the stars . And even for her , the poor starved one , there was a moment . Her eyes could see the stars and the sky . Red Oliver 's own mother had got religion in that way , not at a camp meeting but in a poor little church at the edge of a mill village . No doubt , Red thought , hers had also been a starved life . He had n't thought of that when he was a boy with his father and when he had seen the poor whites at a camp meeting . His father had stopped his car in the road . There were voices calling in a little grassy place under trees and he saw men and women kneeling under a torch made from a pine knot . His father had smiled and a look of disdain had flitted across his face . There was a voice calling to the young woman at the camp meeting . " He 's there ... up there ... it 's Jesus . He wants you . " In the young woman a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike anything she had ever known before . She felt hands touching her body in the night . " Now . Now . " " You . You . I want you . " Could there be some one ... God ... a strange being off somewhere in the mysterious distance who wanted her ? " Who wants me , with my thin little body and the tirednessin me ? " She would have been like that little girl named Grace who used to work in the cotton mill at Langdon , Georgia , the one Red Oliver had seen the first summer he worked in the mill . . . the one the other mill woman named Doris was always trying to protect . Doris going to that one at night , caressing her with herP254hands , trying to take the tiredness out of her , trying to bring life into her . But you may be a tired , thin young woman and have no Doris . Dorises are , after all , pretty rare in this world . You are a poor white working girl in a mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cotton field . You look at your own thin sticks of legs and at your thin arms . You do n't even dare say to yourself , " I 'd like to be rich , or beautiful . I 'd like to have the love of a man . " What would be the use ? But at the camp meeting . " It 's Jesus . " " White . Wonderful . " " Up there . " " He wants You . He will take you . " It might be just a debauch . Red knew that . He knew his father had felt that way about the camp meeting they had . watched when Red was a boy . There was such a young woman letting herself go . She screamed . She fell to the ground . She groaned . People gathered about  --  her own kind of people . " Look , she has got it . " She had wanted it so . She had n't known what she wanted . It was an experience for that girl , vulgar but certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the trouble with nice people . It might be only the poor , the humble , the ignorant , who could let themselves go like that . RED OLIVER sat with his back against the little tree in the camp of workers . There was something in the air of the place , a kind of subdued tenseness that had got into him . That might have been due to the sound of the voices of people coming from the shack where the light was . Voices of people talked low and earnestly in the dark places . There came times of silence , then the talk began again . Red couldn'tP255distinguish words . His nerves were stirred . He had grown wide awake . " Lord , " he thought , " I am here , in this place now . " " How did I get here ? Why did I let myself get here ? " This was n't a camp of religious enthusiasts . He knew that . He knew what it was . " Well , I do n't know , " he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree and thinking . " I have got myself into a mess , " he thought . He had wanted to come to the communist camp . No , he had n't . Yes , he had . He sat quarreling with himself as he had been doing for days . " If I could only be sure of myself , " he thought . Again he thought of his mother getting religion in the little church at the edge of the mill village when he was at home , still a high school boy . He had been for a week , for ten days , for perhaps two weeks , coming toward this place into which he had now got . He had wanted to come . He had n't wanted to come . He had let himself get excited about something that perhaps did n't concern him at all . He had been reading newspapers , books , thinking , trying to think . The newspapers of the South had been full of strange news . They announced the coming of communism into the South . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to talk about that , about the lying of the newspapers . They did n't lie openly , Neil said . They were clever . They twisted the stories , made things seem as they were n't . Neil Bradley had wanted a social revolution or had thought he did . " I guess he wants it okay , " Red thought that night sitting in the camp . " But why should I be thinking about Neil ? " It was strange to be sitting there in that place and thinkingthat only a few months before , that very spring , when he had got out of college , he had been with Neil Bradley on a Kansas farm . Neil had wanted him to stay out there . If he had stayed , how different his summer might have been !
