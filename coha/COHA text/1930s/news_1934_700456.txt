txt Belgium awoke today to learn that her King was dead and the nation has been plunged into deepest mourning . For the time at least , party quarrels are being forgotten as the body of Albert , who was killed yesterday in a fall while scaling a cliff , lies in state in his bedroom on the ground floor of the royal chateau at Laeken , where it was taken early this morning . The funeral has been fixed for Thursday and on Friday Crown . Prince Leopold will be proclaimed Leopold III , , King of the Belgians . Queen Elizabeth , who is far from well , was spared the news of the King 's death as long as possible . When finally she was informed of the tragedy near 6 o'clock this morning she collapsed and has been confined to her apartments all day . Body Found at 2 A. M. King Albert 's body was found at 2 ' o'clock this morning at the foot of a precipice at Marche les Dames near Namur , where the rocks rise a sheer 600 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , and only a few weeks I ago was classified as a national preserve . Undoubtedly it was this fact that induced the King , who knew the district well and had more than once scaled the rocks in the area , to visit it again . Quite possibly he had no intention of making a climb when he left his automobile , accompanied only by his valet , M. van Dyck . But his passion for rock climbing undoubtedly seized him when he reached the spot . According to M. van Dyck , who was well accustomed to his habits , he looked at his watch as if wondering whether he had time and , getting out of the automobile , asked the valet to wait . M. van Dyck saw him start out up the rocks , but in a few minutes he was lost to view and was never seen again alive . When darkness came the valet , who knew the King had an appointment at a performance in the Palais des Sports in Brussels , became uneasy . He had every confidence in the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch would be late for his Brussels appointment , telephoned Baron Edmond Carton de Wiest , former secretary to the King , who has a chateau near by . Baron de Wiart telephoned to the Laeken palace to say the King had been delayed and went with the valet to begin a search . Search Most of Night . They shouted and searched for some time and were joined by villagers and finally by gendarmes and gamekeepers . The searchers spent the greater part of the night hunting for the King among the rocks known as the " Crows ' Nest , " because of their inaccessibility . The party searching in the darkness did so at great peril , climbing rocky needles again and again . Using lanterns , the more venturesome among the villagers climbed and searched everywhere . At 2 A. M. General Jacques de Dixmude found the body by accident when his foot caught In the rope the King had attached to himself as an aid in scaling the rocks . The body was bent double and there was a huge gash in the left side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobnailed boots . Those who were present when the body was found say the climbing rope was still wrapped around the King 's waist . The body lay at the foot of a great pinnacle rock and in a little crevasse . Some loose rocks near by indicated that either a foothold or a handhold that the King had taken had given way . It was judged from the severity of his injuries that he must have been near the top when the accident occurred . So far as the King 's fall can be reconstructed today it would seem that he lost his hold when about half-way to the summit of a concave rock he had set out to climb . Personal Belongings Found . His eyeglasses were found on top of a rock about thirty-six feet above where his body was discovered . His cap and a. little canvas sack he had carried were found some distance away . His climbing axe lay near the body . The violence of the fall was shown by traces of blood in two or three places where the body had struck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rock , and death must have been instantaneous . Villagers thought the accident undoubtedly had been caused when pieces of rock gave way , as they always do , toward the end of Winter when frost has pried them loose and water has seeped in . The body was carried to the road and immediately taken by motor to the chateau at Laeken , where it arrived about 3:30 o'clock . There it lies in state with the head swathed in bandages , which cover the whole left side . Two Sisters of Mercy have knelt all day at the bedside . Queen Elizabeth had been informed early in the evening that the King had been delayed by an automobile accident and had retired . Then this morning she was informed first that he had been injured and finally that he was dead . Leopold Arrives in Brussels .

The Prince then returned to his compartment in the train , which was taken to the private royal station at Laeken . There he went first to greet and console his mother , Queen Elizabeth , then alone to the room in which his father 's body lay clothed in a general 's khaki uniform . The King 's face , according to those who have seen it , wears a look of complete repose and quiet strength . Prince Leopold had been informed of the tragedy by telephone .
