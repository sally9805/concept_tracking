Franklin D. Roosevelt was feeling jolly . As he got into a flag-draped barge at Cap Haitien the boom-boom-boom of saluting guns had no irritating effect upon his nerves . For three days he had had nothing but laughs at the expense of the three sad newshawks who followed in his wake aboard the destroyer Gilmer-laughs at their landlubber language as he read their dispatches before they were sent by the Houston 's radio ; laughs at their seasickness as their thin little craft rolled like a porpoise . The biggest and best laugh of all came when , in a whaleboat , they followed his fishing gig off Long Island in the Bahamas , got close enough to see the color of his clothes ( old trousers , a blue coat ) , and witnessed his landing of a 35-lb. barracuda . <P> When the President reached Haiti , he was in his most amiable mood . Entering a car with his friend President Stenio Vincent , he motored through Cap Haitien streets , spent an hour at the Union Club with island notables . U.

Mr. Roosevelt , with a good glass of West Indian swizzle* in his hand , replied with a toast , " to the health of the President of Haiti , to the Government of Haiti and to the people of Haiti . " <P> All this took place in two hours . President Roosevelt again boarded the Houston to continue his tour of the Antilles . Next morning the cruiser and its convoy anchored at the lace-making town Mayaguez on the West Coast of Puerto Rico . Governor Blanton Winship put the President and his Sons Franklin Jr . and John into automobiles , drove them along the Island 's west and south shores to Ponce , then by the military road over the mountains to lunch at the Governor 's summer palace at Jajome Alto . At every village on the way the President 's car stopped for three minutes to allow the local mayor to make a speech and be thanked . A drizzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being as enthusiastic as that staged for President Hoover two years ago . At dusk , two hours late because of skiddy roads and with his white suit bedraggled by the rain , the President and party drove into San Juan through a dense , cheering , flower-throwing crowd . <P> That night the President dined with Governor Winship at La Fortaleza , conferred on plans for providing the island with an economic New Deal . Next morning he toured the slums of San Juan , shook hands with friends including Jean Springstead Whittemore , who wangled from warm-hearted Postmaster Farley the fat job of Collector of the Customs , and Toste ( " Mimi " ) Lovet , 13-year-old poliomyelitis victim , once at Warm Springs . <P> " Why , Mimi , " cried the President . " I 'm so happy to see you ! Why , you can walk ! Tell me , how are you ? " <P> " I 'm very well , Papa Roosevelt .
