txt The indictments against Bernard K. Marcus , president of the Bank of United States and seven other officers and directors of the bank , were upheld yesterday by Judge William Allen of the Court of General Sessions . The court denied two motions by attorneys for Mr. Marcus and five of his fellow-defendants . The motions brought by Charles H. Tuttle , counsel for Mr. Marcus , and supported by counsel of five of the indicted bankers , challenged the legality of the indictments on two grounds . These were the alleged disqualification of Max D. Steuer , who as Assistant District Attorney presented the evidence to the grand jury , and of three of the grand jurors because they owned stock in the bank . Mr. Steuer 's disqualification was challenged by the attorneys for the defense on the ground of his dual . capacity as Assistant District Attorney and Assistant Attorney General in the bank investigation and of his association with litigations involving the bank . Tir decision of Judge Alle ? Is final . The indicted bankers must now prepare for trial . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early trial may be expected . While District Attorney Crain would not venture to predict the probable date of the trial , it was believed it would be held before the Summer vacation . Mr. Marcus and those of the indicted bankers who joined in his motions will again appear for pleading before Judge Allen today . It is considered not unlikely that they may ask separate trials . The grand jury , which resumed its inquiry on Wednesday into several hew aspects of the bank 's affairs , met again yesterday and heard Frank Hedley , president and general manager of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company , and Frederick Hobbs , both directors of the bank . Mr. Hobbs will continue his testimony today and will be followed by other directors . No additional indictments are expeected for some time , however . The grand jury will adadjourn today for about ten days or more to permit Mr. Steuer to resume his open hearings . These will be resumed on Monday . On the ground of Mr. Steuer 's disqualification Judge Allen in his decision pointed out that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found wanting . Judge Allen wrote : " The matters set forth in the moving affidavit in support of the motion to set aside and quash the indictments have been passed upon adversely to the contentions of the moving parties by the Supreme Court at special term , by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals . " But , irrespective of prior adjudi- cation , the reasons advanced and the grounds urged , for the relief asked , are without merit . The indictments are not attacked for insufficiency . The motion does not come within the provisions of Section 313 of the code of criminal procedure . The wide range of authorities cited in behalf of the moving parties are not controlling of the matters to be determined upon this motion . Neither public policy nor the proper administration of justice call for the quashing of the indictments .

Among the assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who were active in their attains . Among the securities are many blocks of capital stock shares issued by subsidiaries . The same is true as to the Delaware Bankus schedule . The filing of the schedules will probably avert the contempt proceedings threatened against officers of the affiliates , who are also officers of  --  the bank , by James N. Rosenberg , counsel for the Irving Trust Company , receiver . Permission to bring such contempt proceedings has been given to Mr. Rosenberg by Robert P. Stephenson , referee in bankruptcy , because of the delay in the filing of the schedules . On the second motion , containing the charge that three of the grand jurors were biased , Judge Allen declared : " The grounds urged in the moving affidavits for an order dismissing the indictrmmts are not convincing . The defendants have not been deprived of any of their constitutional rights . The grand jury which heard the evidence and handed down the indictments was legally constituted . Assuming that some of their number were stockholders of the Bank of United States , such fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sworn they became a legal entity . That seems to be well-settled law In this State . " Counsel for the moving parties have gone far afield in search of authorities to support their contentions , but of the many cited none , not excepting those upon which special emphasis is laid in the briefs , is controlling of the questions under consideration . " The five of the eight indicted officials of the bank who associated themselves with Mr. Marcus in the two motions were Saul Singer , ex 1 ecutive vice president ; Herbert Singer , director and son of Mr. Singer ; Henry W. Pollock and Simon H. Kugel , vice presidents , and Isidor J. Kresel , counsel and director of the bank . C. Stanley Mitchell , chairman of the board , and Alexander S.
