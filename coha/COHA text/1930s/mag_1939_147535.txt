Off the train at Seattle one day last week stepped plump , upright Philip A. Benson , president of Brooklyn 's big Dime Savings Bank . To nosy newshawks who asked him if it was true that bankers started wars he retorted : " Hooey ! " <P> So saying , Banker Benson taxied to Seattle 's Olympic Hotel for the 65th annual meeting of the American Bankers Association , of which he was president . To 2,500 banker delegates he sermonized : " We are meeting in the shadow of another great war . ... We must be prepared for whatever shocks may come . " <P> No more definite than that were the other generalizations of the four-day gathering and boat trip . Bankers saw small chance of Government agencies taking over their functions , denounced Federal deficits , deplored the growth of the Government-inspired U. S. " gim me " attitude , felt that no long-run good would come to U. S. business from World War II . On one issue , however , they were with President Roosevelt . They wanted the neutrality act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. A. presidents . Anything but cut- &-dried; is its newest one , Robert March Hanes , 49 , president of Winston-Salem , N. C. 's Wachovia Bank &; Trust Co. ( largest bank between Washington and Atlanta ; deposits : $91,000,000 ) . Fond of quail shooting , lively parties , buzzing about , he has sat in both General Assembly and Senate of his State Legislature . For years he rode a motorcycle to the bank every day . Once it got away from him , ripped through his wife 's pet flower bed . Evaded he : " Mildred , some damn fool has torn up your flower bed . " Said she : " I know who the damn fool is . " <P> A conservative Democrat , Banker Hanes is capable , hardworking , no pioneer . His family has not needed a pioneer since the late textile tycoon John W. Hanes Sr. piled up a fortune in the Hanes Hosiery Mills , invested most of it in R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . ( Camels ) . From him Son Hanes inherited about half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers coasted on their inheritance . All of them have made careers for themselves . Most notable is John W. , who made a bigger fortune than his father , is now Under Secretary of the U. S. Treasury . Dr. Frederick is a professor at Duke University Medical School ; Alex is a leading Winston-Salem stock broker ; James is head of Hanes Hosiery Mills Co. , largest U. S. women 's seamless silk hosiery knitting plant ; Ralph is head of a dye and finishing business which he founded . <P> For years small-town bankers have badgered their big-city brothers for more rural A. B. A. presidents . This year they got their candy . Wachovia is a small-town bank . But no hayseed is Wachovia 's able President Hanes . As much at home in Wall Street as in Winston-Salem , he is a big-city banker in a small town .
