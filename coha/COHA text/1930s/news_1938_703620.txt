txt This Is a rather sad story . It exposes , not the iniquity , but the orneriness of newspapers . It really is telling tales out of school , and if I did n't believe that newspapers should turn the light of inquiry on themselves sometimes . I Would n't tattle . Last winter , you see , Cleveland was hard hit by the depression . But so were a lot of other places . Yet Cleveland became a sort of national horrible example . Pictures blossomed out in the Nation 's papers and magazines showing bread-lines and ragged children clinging to ragged parents in the streets of Cleveland , Out-of-town papers sent reporters to Cleveland . On one day , Mayor Harold H. Burton had four or five such itinerants in his office . It was no fun for Cleveland , getting all this unfavorable publicity as the Nation 's rock-bottom city . It was bad for business ; it outraged civic pride . And here is how it all came about : One day the editor of a national picture service saw a squib in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got excited , and wired for pictures . His local office in Cleveland did n't have any pictures . They had n't noticed hungry Mobs In the street . But they looked through the picture-morgue of a local newspaper , and they found some rather horrible photos that had accumulated in the past eight years . They sent them along , " Fine , , " wired the editor . " Give us more Cleveland horror . " The photographers then went out on the streets . it was hard to get good pictures . But they faked a few ( perhaps I should say , they set the stage ) and managed to get one kiddie crying and another with a hole in his pants , and what with one thing and another they did fairly well with " Cleveland horror " These pictures , going on the wires , got a tremendous play all across the country , and for all I know were re-touched and re-produced in Berlin and Moscow as examples of what could happen under a demo - oldie economy . The nation  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big display . That stirred editors into sending reporters to Cleveland . To read the papers in cities which might actually have been equally hard-hit , you would think that Cleveland was on the point of toppling into Lake Pale Made to Order Came the day  --  and I suppose this was the climax ? when one luckless man threatened to commit suicide in Mayor Burtor 's office . and the picture service digging again into a convenient newspaper morgue , resurrected an old photo of a line of folks getting commodities from a distributing agency . That brought tears to the grizzled cheeks of editors from the Atlantic to the Pacific , eager to show readers that the " Jonesen have It worse than we have . " Then Cleveland rebelled . The outraged Chamber of Commerce formed the " Cleveland Plan " which was in part an anti-hoarding drive , and in part an effort to counteract depressive propaganda with genuine and cheerful news . It goes without saying that recent special pages about Cleveland in The Christian Science Monitor were received with rapturous relief by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues a sheet called Good News which chronicles Cleveland 's steady reemployment , In it copy which Mayor Burton allowed me in his office ; it told of 800 men returning to work In one plant , of 100 typical concerns rehiring employees they had let but in May , June , and July , and so on down the list . The publication , and the whole effort , Is a deliberate effort to counteract malevolent ? if flukv  --  nubliclis . Bad But Not Ilopeleas Actually , Cleveland 's industrial picture remains grave , but there is real promise . The city 's automotive plants mostly manufacture accessories , bodies , parts , etc. and feel the upturn later than the parent factories In Michigan , But steel is going along better than it did . Both the possibility of European war and the hurricane damage in New England are being examined by Clevelanders as sources of more work for industries here . Yet Cleveland has had an object lesson in a curious field of publicity . It was a victim of circumstances , for Detroit or Pittsburgh or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been signaled out just as reasonably . But the eye of a picture editor fell upon Cleveland , and the morgues of newspapers here were bettor stocked , and a whole chain of events was started from which the city in just emerging . ( Of course , I 'm not saying the depression was caused by publicity , I 'm merely recording the unwelcome and exaggerated advertising that struck here . ) Meantime , Cleveland has some ' 10,000 persons on relief  --  multiplied by 31/2 members in the average family that shows about 280,000 persons dependent on WPA alone  --  and that figure is adequately grave . But about $00 persons a weeliare going back to work from WPA , and many more are being re-employed who were n't on relief at all . WPA is admittedly well-handled here , through an able state administrator and the fertile efforts of Mayor Burton . Though he is a Republican , and a Maine man , lie has obtained more relief money from Washington , relative to population , than any other mayor with the possible exception of Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-November ( when a sympathetic state administration Is expected td be in power . But by then business may be booming . And then if that happens the wire-photo services will , be clamoring for pictures of smoke pouring from Cleveland chimneys and shifts working all night , It 's all in the game , but what a game !
