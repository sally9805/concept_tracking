First the railroads asked for a 15% freight-rate rise . ICC said 5.3% was enough . Then they asked for a 15% wage cut . Franklin Roosevelt 's Railway Fact-Finding Board said No . This left the railroads , stretched between the engine of rising costs and the caboose of lagging traffic , with no recourse but legislative aid . So Mr. Roosevelt asked three railroad officials and three railroad labor officers to prepare proposals for Congress . <P> Hard at work ever since October , cudgeling their brains four days a week with the aid of a battery of experts , have been the six railroaders-Presidents Martin Withington Clement of Pennsylvania and Ernest Eden Norris of Southern , Vice Chairman Carl Raymond Gray of Union Pacific , Chairman George McGregor Harrison of the Railway Labor Executives ' Association , President Bert Mark Jewell of the Railway Employes ' Department of A. F. of L. and President David Brown Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen . Last week , after Messrs . Gray and Harrison again conferred with Franklin Roosevelt , the committee finally reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a preamble , which laid the industry 's troubles to Government " favoritism " toward certain competing forms of transport , they listed proposals very similar to those formulated at the President 's behest last April by the Splawn Committee of three ICCommissioners ( TIME , April 18 ) . <P> Last week the six railroaders echoed the Splawn recommendations for repeal of land-grant freight rates for Government traffic , creation of a Transport Board to supervise all transport , creation of a special railroad court to handle reorganizations , loosening of RFC purse strings , and relieving ICC of the necessity of certifying that roads borrowing from RFC are not in need of reorganization . Only major additions were pleas for a flexible rate structure adaptable to changing business conditions , for equal taxes on competing forms of transport , for terminating ICC sponsorship of consolidations . <P> Two topics were notable by omission- labor and funded debt . The latter is significant since Senator Burton K. Wheeler , chairman of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee which will chaperon the report in the Senate , firmly believes that top-heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and well remembering that the similar Splawn proposals died in Congress , the railroad industry last week was not too sanguine of legislative help . But Franklin Roosevelt still sat pretty , for if Congress again refuses to act he can not be blamed .
