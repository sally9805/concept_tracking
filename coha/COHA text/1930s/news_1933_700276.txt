txt The Proposed Service Charge . To the Editor of The New York rimes : What is the matter with the restaurant business ? No department store expects a customer to tip the sales person selling the goods desired , nor does any grocery or butcher shop expect a tencent tip to the clerk for each head of lettuce or pound of hamburger purchased . Why then should any restaurant expect patrons to add 10 per cent to the check for a " service charge " ? As I understand it , tipping began as payment for special service . It became a social custom , so that restaurant diners were expected to tip the waiter no matter how bad the service was . Few of us were brave enough to defy custom . I can see some sense in the ancient habit of paying for extra attention , but absolutely none in a 10 per cent service charge . Let the restaurant owner pay his own salaries , and add the extra cost to the prices on his bill of fare , if he must . H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
