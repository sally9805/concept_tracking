txt Proof of the growing public appetite for new bonds was afforded yesterday by the reception which was given to the three major offerings of bonds , when the syndicate books on the $75,000,000 New York Central and $50,000,000 Pennsylvania Railroad issues were closed in two hours , both issues having been oversubscribed , and when the doors of the syndicate managers of the $66,000 , - I 000 Port of New York Authority issue were stormed.at 7 o'clock in the morning by members of the syndi7 cate anxious to get their full quota of bonds and the pick of maturities . So far as the $125,000,000 of railroad financing was concerned , it was said the books could have been closed in fifteen minutes , but were kept open longer in deference to out-oftown dealers . These sales , in effect , were wholesale affairs , since many blocks of bonds were bought by dealers for retail offering , but so far as the syndicates are concerned , the bonds are all sold . ' Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. marketed the Pennsylvania issue over their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a group comprising J. P. Morgan &; Co. , the/ First National Bank of New York , the National City Company , the Guaranty Company of New York , the Bankers Company of New York , Chase Securities Corporation , Harris , Forbes &; Co. ; Kidder Peabody &; Co. and Lee , Higginson &; Co . Syndicate Members Eager . On only a few occasions in recent years have the syndicate managers of any bond issue found syndicate participants at their doors long before the opening of the regular business day . One banker observed yesterday that the line reminded him of queues formed early in the morning at the doors of the banking houses in London when new issues which are greatly desired are brought out . The syndicate on the Port Authority issue was headed by the National City Company , the Chase Securities Corporation , Brown Brothers , Harriman &; Co. , Harris , Forbes &; Co. and Kissel , Kinnicutt &; Co. , and included twenty-six associates . At the close of business last night the managers reported that $55,000,000 of the $66,000,000 had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Central 4%s of 2013 was done yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , with the opening price at 1001 . The market closed at the original syndicate offering price of par . The Pennsylvania 414 of 1981 went to a slight premium in the over-thecounter market above the offering price of 961/2 . The actual turning point in the general feeling toward the bond market took place last week when ? the issue of $100,000,000 city of New York long-term corporate stock and serial bonds was disposed of by the bankers in the record time of thirty minutes . Since this sale the odd blocks of the bonds available ' in the open market- have been quoted at prices appreciably above the original offering levels . The market at present is practically bare of high-grade taxexempt issues . Cheap money rates and the uncertain movement of stock prices of late have operated in favor of the bond market as it is by no means the case that the stock market . and the bond market move in unison . Bankers pointed out yesterday that , with investors taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be an improvement in the market for foreign loans to a point where new foreign borrowing here would be done . At present , foreign borrowers who could obtain loans here cheaply are not in need of money , and those who would be glad to borrow could scarcely be accommodated except at relatively high rates of . interest . In this connection it was pointed out that many investors still regard an unusually high return on a bond as evidence of inherent weakness in the issue . When this situation is righted , it is held likely that much of the foreign short-term borrowing , chiefly in the nature of bank loans , will be consolidated into long-term issues . Although nearly every banking house in Wall Street is said to have some financing which could be marketed at almost any time , as market conditions might dictate , comparatively little of this financing is imperative so that it is said that it does not necessarily follow that the demand for bonds will be checked by a series of new offerings . Chief among the new issues expected shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $70,000,000 for the Fox Film Corporation .
