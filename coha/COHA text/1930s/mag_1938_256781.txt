While the P.O.U.M. affairs ( see above ) have been Scandal No. 1 in Leftist Spain , there has also been the affair of Malaga . The Leftist commander of the defenses of this rich Mediterranean port-taken in February 1937 by the Spanish Rightists with great swiftness and ease-was Colonel Jos Villalba , who has been sitting in prison ever since . He was suddenly put on trial last week before the Leftist supreme military tribunal-not the Barcelona civil court before which P.O.U.M. was simultaneously being tried . Among witnesses called to brand Colonel Villalba as a sellout to Rightist Spain was the Chief of the General Staff of Leftist Spain , General Vicente Rojo , and its early Premier &; War Minister Largo Caballero.
