Although the destruction of the Hindenburg three weeks ago was the most completely witnessed aerial disaster in history , the subsequent Department of Commerce inquiry at Lakehurst droned along inconclusively for two weeks until uprose a man who had been in Austria when the great dirigible burned . Although he had not seen the tragedy which cost 36 lives and $3,000,000 , * wise old Dr. Hugo Eckener , world 's No. 1 lighter-than-air authority , had spent a week looking at the wreckage , examining meteorological records , still and motion picture films , listening to the testimony of survivors and ground crew . When he took the witness chair , Dr. Eckener felt prepared to give the first comprehensive account of what happened and why . <P> Barring the possibility that the Hindenburg 's commander , Captain Max Pruss , might reveal conflicting facts when he is recovered enough to testify , Dr. Eckener 's explanation seemed likely to be accepted as final . He concluded that the disaster was caused : by lightning or static electricity from a small , following thunderstorm , igniting free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German translated by Vice President Frederick W. Meister of American Zeppelin Transport Co. , and discarding sabotage in short order , Dr. Eckener reached his conclusion by the following reasoning : " Theoretically I believe there are only three possibilities of such ignition . First , the least probable is ball lightning . I have never seen it and have no knowledge of it or the conditions creating it . I only know that ball lightning can show peculiar actions , which are incalculable and moody . <P> From observations of witnesses who have described the appearance and dimensions of the fire , it would be difficult to assume that such a ball was the cause . . . . <P> " The second possibility is ignition from motor exhaust or sparks . I would like to very definitely decline this possibility . We have made such exhaustive tests of temperatures and the operation of Diesel engines . ... In our years of experience it has never happened that gas has been ignited by sparks while being valved . . . . <P> " We used to discharge gas through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is done through ventilating shafts at the top of the ship . In earlier days the exhausts were located nearer to the central corridor than now , yet we never had any ignition then . Under those conditions we have valved gas hundreds of times without fire . . . . <P> " That gas , which we assume was present in the top of the ship , was ignited either by lightning or by a static spark . The meteorological situation . . . was such that a greater potential gradient* could not be present at the time of the fire . ... If one studies the wind directions and velocities and temperatures more closely as indicated on the charts , he can recognize that the first storm must have been followed by a smaller one .
