txt The most Immediate need confronting the Federal Government is the balancing of the budget through reduction of expenses or the enactment of a broad basis of taxation . Without measures of this sort , the deficit for the fiscal year 1934 will be closer to $1,000,000,000 than the $307,000,000 estimated by President Hoover . Another need is the rebuilding of the budgetary machinery to prevent deficits or place the responsibility for them . A system is proposed under which a budget committee would submit to the House a program listing all authorized expenditures and the way the necessary enue would be rained . Any Congressman protesting an increased appropriation would have to propose a method for raising the funds , placing the responsibility squarely on the responsible party . BY WILLIAM H. GRIMR.S . Staff ** of TH . WALL Srn.nr WASHINGTON  --  The problem of federal fiscal reform presents two angles . Immediately there is necessity for early and " unquestioned " balancing of the budget for the coming fiscal year of 1934 . Beyond that is the need for permanent rebuilding of budgetary machinery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to place responsibility for them . The immediate requirement is for reduction of government expenses to bare running necessities , and if that fails to scale expenditures to anticipated revenues , the enactment of a broadly based system of taxation such as the sales tax . Unless measures of this sort are adopted the 1934 deficit v.-1U be closer to $1,000,000,000 than to the $307,000,000 estimated by President Hoover The public debt will be increased by that amount and interest charges will be piling up into a staggering tax burden for years to come . At this time Congress seems in no mood to take adequate action . However , that stand can be changed . The long time remedy requires new legislation and new practice , first , to establish a definite , single-headed legislative relationship between revenue and expenditures , second , to give party leaders definite authority ands responsibility to preserve the balance , and third , to enable the public to place definitely responsibility for failure . Sherley Proposed Budget Plan A plan to accomplish these ends was proposed by Swagar Sherley , a former Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pioneer advocates of a federal budget system . Congress never went so far as Mr. Sherley proposed , but he was instrumental in helping bring about the present executive budget plan . Previoua to the creation or the present Budget Bureau each government department made its own estimates of the money it needed . It carried these to various committees of the House ; the Army went to the Military Committee , the Navy to the Naval Affairs , etc . The committees framed supply bills and brought them to the House , each knowing little and probably caring less for the plans of another committee . The present so-called budget system made a considerable correction in this . It set Up a Budget Director and Bureau responsible to the President . All executive estimates of expenditures went to this bureau where they were brought into one big expenditures picture . At the same time the House changed its practice so that all estimates , submitted after examination by the Budget Bureau , went to one committee . the House Appropriations Committee . The reform probably has saved the taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau has nothing to do with revenues nor the means of raising them . Neither has the House Appropriations Committee except that as members of the House its members have a vote on revenue legislation . So the responsibility for revenue legislation is one place and the appropriation responsibility is another . Furthermore , any member of Congress at any time may have an idea calling for huge present and future expenditures contemplated neither by the Budget Bureau nor the Appropriations Committee . Rut if he can get enough of the House and Senate to agree with him . his idea makes a new charge on the federal government . The President is the one official in whom centers responsibility for both revenue and expenditures . However , he shares that with Congress . And Congress may accept his recommendation for revenue and not expenditures or vice versa . Most often it accepts neither but goes its way without regard to any relationship between the two . The inevitable result is that it is impossible for any but an expert to get a complete picture of federal fiscal operaticns at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit to Congress Congress can charge it to the executive ? they did during the late campaign  --  and no citizen can have any hope of knowing which is right . Need for Expense , Revenue Tieup Obviously there is aced for direct and definite relationship between the responsibility for revenue and the responsibility for expenditures . The place for that so far as the legislative branch is concerned is in the House of Representatives which has the constitutional authority to initiate both revenue and appropriations measures . It is proposed there be created a. budget committee composed chiefly of members of the appropriations and ways and means committee of the House , who at the beginning of each session of Congress would bring out a definite program to include first , what expenditures are to be authorized and how they are to be divided among various government actisities , and second , what revenues are needed to meet these expenditures and how they are to be obtained . It may be assumed that such a program would he drawn only after conferences with the executive departr.ents in charge of taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the minority party in each case would present its own program to check the majority . Say that the program called for an expenditore of $3 500.000,000 So much would be allotted to War and Navy . so much to Commerce , etc Along v. ith this division of expenditure would go a description of the taxes by which the $3,500,000,000 was to be raised . The House could amend , change or even reject the whole program and adopt another in its place Limit On Expenditure Better Once the House accepted the program , the total appropriation allotted to any activity would be distributed in hills drawn just as at present , but the committee drawing the bill could not exceed the total allotment decided upon ; it might reduce it , it tee I-low-e approved . During consideration of these measures in the House it v. Quid not be in order for any member to move to increase the total allotment to any activity unless at the same time ue proposed measures to raise the new money called for . The system would give every citizen who cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay to Washington and what was being done with them for it would draw the complete fiscal picture for the year on one canvas . Also it would definitely place responsibility . There is also discussed a proposal to separate government capital expenditures , that is those for buildings and other public works from general running expenses . The capital expenditures would be paid out of bonds for which there would he interest and amortization charges in separate account . The plea that in doing this the government would be following the accepted practice of private business often fails to take into account that private capital expenditures furnish the means for liquidating themselves while government expenditures do not . For instance , the new Commerce Building pays no rent . Of course it could be charged with rent so that the capital expenditure would gradually be liquidated . But whatever is done the taxpayers finally pay for the building . The important thing to recognize is that separation of capital and running expenses is an accounting reform , which may he needed , but it will not save the taxpayers a. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he so managed to complicate the present fiscal practice .
