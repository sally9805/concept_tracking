" SLAPSTICK " A STORY BY ELAINE STERNE CARRINGTON T WENTY years ago there was a saloon in Hoboken near the water- front known as Micky 's . It was ten o'clock on a Saturday night , and the place was full of a half-tipsy , roistering , thirsty crowd . They milled about the bar , exchanging banter with Eddie , the barkeeper , picking up and setting down drinks , leaving on the marble slab little wet rings which Eddie instantly pounced on and mopped up with a foul rag . Then they moved on to the free-lunch counter , munched thirst-producing victuals , and made way for newcomers who , in turn , shoved their way to the bar . There was a good deal of loud talk , laughter , snatches of song , which was suddenly merged into a yell of welcome as Big Tim O'Connors came in . He was a huge , muscular man standing six feet four in his stocking feet and making the other big , brawny men present seem puny by comparison . He was one of Mieky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night he spent all his week 's pay in a grand splurge there and invariably went home and beat his wife . Even this added to his prestige . He was a big man , a whale of a man , a giant of a man . On this particular evening , because it was summer and hot , he wore a stained and faded blue shirt open at the neck , showing a great bristle of stiff , coarse , black hair which sprang out from his chest and grew along the length of his tremendous arms . But his face was handsome , if sullen , and women stopped and eyed him admiringly as he passed , and even half envied his wife , beatings and all . The crowd paid him the tribute of immediate and undivided attention . They elbowed one another out of the way to greet him and to receive in return his casual salute . They laughed when he flung down in rapid succession first one , then a second , then a third whiskey . They laughed when he asked Eddie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of two anremic youths , to serve the crowd , make change , open bottles , and wash tumblers at one and the same time , " Ikw 's business ? " And they laughed at Eddie 's reply , " Rotten . " Everything he said , in his deep-chested voice , like the roll of thunder , was calculated to bring a shout . He was the Saturday night wit , but it was not until a few minutes past ten that his feeder , his foil , his friend came in through the swinging doors . When he appeared he was instantly greeted with a roar of delight , " Here 's Runty now . Lookit . Here 's Runty , Tim . Here 's Runty . " Tim did not acknowledge his presence by so much as the flicker of an eyelash . Runty came in grinning . He was as small as Tim was tall , barely four feet high , thick-set and ugly . Now the fun would begin . The crowd around the bar , as if at a signal , cleared an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumps of teeth , sauntered towards the glasses and bottles . " What 'll it he ? " Eddie demanded , winking at Big Tim . over and over , always grinning , until he became so winded he was forced to sit down . His friends surrounded him and jeered at him , good-naturedly . " Aw , Runty , why do n't you stand up to him ? " " What are you scared of ? " " Why do n't you sock him one ? " They were impatient with him for resting . They wanted the sport to recommence . They wanted to feel again that split second of thrilling suspense in which Big Tim permitted him to grasp the tumbler but never to quaff its contents . They came there Saturday nights expressly for this and talked about it throughout the week , laying odds against it with any newcomers in the neighborhood who could be beguiled into betting with them . The little man sat without speaking , breathing hard . His hair , mussed and soaked with perspiration , stood up on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt was torn , and through the gap they could see his chest expanding and contracting rapidly . After a while Micky strolled over to him . " Are you going to sit there all night ? " he demanded . " How about stepping on the gas and giving us another round ? " Runty resented the suggestion . This was an act for which he neither asked nor received pay . His one compensation was the plaudits of the crowd . The longer lie kept them waiting the more impatient they became , and the more impatient they became the louder they shouted when he did start in again . It was up to him to decide when to resume the sport . Micky , he knew , was thinking only in terms of dollars and cents . He wanted to keep his customers amused . And noisy . Well , let him wait . Let all of them wait . A man was entitled to get his breath . Micky attempted to prod him into action . " What 's the matter with you ? Getting old ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punches any more ? " At this Runty got up , brushed past him , and went towards the door . Hands reached out to stop him . " Where are you going , Runty ? " " Aw , come on back , Runty . " " Give us some more , Runty . " Even Micky strove to capitulate . " Stick around . I did n't mean nothing . " Runty did not answer . He went outside . It was cooler there , and the air , for all the mixed odors of the mean street , was salty and pungent . As the doors swung back and forth behind him , he turned and glanced into the hot , garishly lighted room , blue with smoke which hung like a gauze curtain from the ceiling . He saw Micky looking after him disconsolately . This cheered him immeasurably as he went next door to see his friend Abie Lowenstein who kept the butcher shop . On Saturday nights it was open until midnight and at present it was crowded with customers , most of them women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron , a great , round , beefy man , with thick red fingers . He was busy with his customers when Runty came in , but stopped to call out to him : " I see you 're at it again . " He laughed as he said it , showing a black gap in his mouth where two front teeth were missing . The women , recognizing Runty , became interested . " Is Tim picking on you yet ? " " Why do n't he get somebody his own size ? " " If I was you I 'd have him arrested . " Others answered for him , " Aw , Runty , lie do n't mind . " " He 's as hard as nails . " " You ought to see his muscle . Show ' em your muscle , Runty . " " Runty lets Tim do it on purpose , do n't you , Runty ? " " He does it to make ' em laugh . That 's why you do it , ai n't it , Runty ? " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship . " Are you going back for more ? " " Sure he is . I bet they 're hollering in there for him already . " He sat down on a three-legged stool while the women continued to question him . As he sat there he watched Abie dispatch his work with neatness and precision ; watched him wield the shining knives and part the red lips of the meat . A pattern of flies rose and dipped , rose and dipped , like miniature vultures , above the carcass he was dissecting . After the crowd had thinned out , Abie wiped his hands on his apron and leaned across the block . " What 's eatin ' you ? " " Nothin ' . " " Aw , you ca n't kid me . " " Nothin ' , I tell you . " " Why ai n't you in there , then ? " " Micky got too fresh . " " What do you mean , fresh ? " " Aw , he got me sore . " " Did n't want to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You said it . " " He should get knocked into a wall himself once yet . Want a drink ? " " Sure . " Abie produced a pint bottle from his hip pocket , and Runty took a long swig of it and felt immediately better and more cheerful . " He got me sore , " he repeated , but with less venom . " And after all you done for him . " " If it was n't for me the crowd would go up to Grogan 's place . " " They got better stuff up there . " " Do n't I know it . " " He ought to pay you good instead of bawling you out . " " He do n't need to pay me . I do n't want no pay . But he ca n't tell me when to start in again . You do n't always feel like it . It ai n't up to him to tell me when to start in again . " " Sure it ai n't . " " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want it no more . " " Thanks . " Runty pocketed it . " Guess I 'll go up to Grogan 's awhile . " " Why do n't you ? " " Guess I will . " " And I would n't go back there tonight if I was you . " " It would serve Micky good and right if I did n't . " " Sure it would . He 'd be out of luck . " Runty got up and tucked in his shirt , which he suddenly realized had been flapping out behind him . " See you later . " The street was filled with Saturday night activity . Children darted across his path , screaming , tagging , pummelling one another . Young girls sat on the steps , fanning themselves . Old women in the windows above leaned far over the sills on their elbows and screamed at the children . Suddenly above the shouts , the screams , and the whines there broke a concerted and ringing chant . It came from Micky 's place . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swinging doors . It was one of Runty 's favorite tunes , and he almost turned in there again , irresistibly drawn by it , but instead he straightened up , with a. frown , and turned his back on it . He went up the street . He could see , some distance away , the bright red snake of light coiling around Grogan 's illuminated name . He tried to find pleasure in the thought that he would soon be there , before a bar . But it was foreign territory to him . He was wedded to Micky 's and seldom went elsewhere . Never on a Saturday night . As soon as he pushed open the doors at Grogan 's a shout went up . " Well , look who 's here . " " Hello , Runty . " " How are you , Runty ? " " Come on in , Runty . " " What 's the matter , Runty , would n't Tim leave you have a drink ? " " What 's the idea of coming here , Runty ? Ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were frankly delighted to see him . Even Grogan leaned over the bar and shook hands with him . " How are you , Runty ? What 'll you have ? This is on the house . " " Make it a whiskey . Straight . " Grogan set the bottle beside the glass . " Help yourself . " Runty did so , generously . The men closed in around him and discussed him as if he were not present . " He 's a little feller but he 's a bear-cat for punishment . " " He can take a bigger licking than any man living and come back for more . " " If you ask me , he 's more than half the team . Any big guy can clout a little guy , but find me the little guy who will ask for more . " Runty filled his glass and drank it off , filled it again . He grinned at the circle of men . They were great fellows . And so was Grogan . He felt kindly towards them all . And towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Come inside my back room . I want to talk to you . " Grogan 's back room was a bare office containing a roll-top desk , a swivel chair , a table , and several straight chairs . On the wall were some fly-specked sporting prints . The room reeked of stale beer . " Sit down , " said Grogan , occupying the desk chair himself . He was a small , cadaverous Irishman . He said , " Listen , I got a proposition to make to you . " Runty felt magnificently fortified to hear it , whatever it was . " How much does Micky pay you to do your act down there ? " " He do n't pay me a red cent . " " What ? " " Not a red cent . " Runty felt suddenly aggrieved about it . " And he even crabs when I take time out to get my breath . " " No kidding ? " Grogan was frankly shocked at the disclosure . " Listen , Runty , how 'd you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you two fellers up here I could turn ' em away of a Saturday night . " Runty was steeped in unutterable sadness . " Micky do n't treat me right . " " Never mind about Micky . You 're going to be through with him . You talk it over with Tim and see if he likes the idea . " Runty bridled . " Tim ? What 's Tim got to do with it ? Tim does whatever I tell him to . I 'm the brains of this act . Who did you think was the brains of this act ? Me or Tim ? " Grogan soothed him . " You . You , of course . Now you tell Tim ? " " Tim does what I say . He 's a big guy but he does what I say , and Micky do n't treat me right . You 've got to admit that . He don ' treat me right . " " Sure . That 's what I 'm telling you . " Grogan got up and patted his shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and get Tim to come up here . " Runty stared at him vacantly . " Wha ' for ? " " What for ? I 've just been telling you . Ten bucks apiece if you bring him up here . " Runty shook his head . " Too late . " Grogan took him roughly by the arm . " Too late ? How do you get that way ? It ai n't twelve yet . It 's just the shank of the evening . You go on down and bring him here and the drinks are on me . " " Too late . " Grogan turned on him with a snarl . " Say , what 's the matter with you ? You 're a four-flusher . You 're stalling . I do n't believe you can get him up here at all . I do n't believe you could make him come if you tried . He would n't do what a little runt like you told him to . Why should he ? " Runty lurched to his feet . He flung the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Say that again , " he roared . Grogan stood over him glowering . " Sure I will . I 'll say it again until you show me different . " Runty 's fists fell to his sides . " All right , " he said , striding to the door , " I 'll show you . " The men shouted at him as he pushed past them . " Where are you going , Runty ? " Grogan 's voice rose above the tumult . " He 's only going down to Micky 's to get Tim . He 'll be right back . " " Good boy . " " Atta boy . " " We 'll be lookin ' for you . " He went into the street , reeling slightly . He was going back to Micky 's . He was not clear as to exactly why . Something to do with Micky . Or was it Tim ? No , Grogan . Anyway , he 'd show them . He 'd show them all . They could n't tell him where to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim had the easy side of it . He did the punching . Anybody could do the punching . But it was another thing to get punched . He wondered how Tim would like that for a change . Or Micky . Or Grogan . By God , he 'd ask them . He 'd put it up to them . And watch them stall . He 'd stood about enough from Micky . Or was it from Tim ? He 'd stood about all he was going to stand . What did they think he was made of , anyhow ? Did n't they think you ever wanted to catch your breath ? And he did n't want ten dollars for it either . Nor a hundred . Nor a thousand . All he wanted was . . . Well , he wanted something , anyhow . And he 'd get it , too . He 'd give them an eyeful . He 'd show them what he was made of . The noise in Micky 's place was deafening . He waited outside for it to subside . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them finish with one net before staging another . He pushed open the door and looked in . Someone spied him , yelled , " It 's Runty ! " and he was dragged in and rushed forward . He resented their hands pushing , pulling , propelling him towards the bar . He wanted to tell them something . He wanted to tell Tim something . He wanted to tell Micky something . He tried to speak but his voice was drowned out in the tumult . And then he saw that Tim was brandishing a long bologna sausage . He was waving it round his head and he was singing . His dark , handsome face was flushed , and his eyes bright . Someone shouted , " Give Runty a drink . Come on , Eddie , give Runty a drink . " Runty eyed them savagely . All right , he 'd have a drink . He 'd have it at the bar like any of the rest of them , and when he got through drinking it , he 'd tell them something . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddie slapped the drink on the bar . The crowd went wild . They shouted and yelled . They climbed up on tables and chairs to see . They pummelled one another . They urged him on . They shrieked warnings and admonitions , and then came the tense , electric silence as he reached for the drink . A sudden swish through the air of the long sausage . It caught Runty across the head and face , smashing the glass , cutting his lip , and sending him crashing into the wall . The crowd rocked with laughter . Runty straightened up and approached the bar again . He was going to have that drink . This time he was going to have that drink . He wanted it , and he needed it . And he was going to have that drink . He reached for it . Whang went the sausage , across his chest . He coughed and sputtered and the crowd roared . He could n't get a drink , and he began to shake as if from a chill . Each time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sausage like a club . He was half blinded , white , trembling . He had to have a drink . Good God , could n't they see he had to have a drink ? He retreated to his corner and dabbed at his cut lip with his sleeve . Micky came by . " You 're going great , Runty ! Keep it up ! " Keep it up ! Be a clown . Let them knock you about and smash you to bits just as long as they laughed and bought more liquor and laughed again . He wormed his way through the crowd and went outside . He fumbled in his pocket for the bottle Abie had given him , found it , and unscrewed the lid withshaking fingers . He drank deeply and the whiskey burned his throat like liquid fire . He finished the bottle ; flung it away and staggered into Abie 's shop . He felt a mounting rage which was like a red flame before his eyes . A rage at Micky . At Tim . At Abie . At Abie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the act of a friend ? Was it ? But Abie was not in the store . He could hear him moving about in the back room , talking to his wife . Runty ranged around , head down , shoulders hunched . Approaching the chopping block , he picked up the cleaver and brought it down on the wood with such force that it stuck fast there and he could not wrench it loose . It gave him a certain savage pleasure to tug at it . Then a burst of laughter next door at Micky 's arrested his attention . He moved towards the sound . He went inside again . No one noticed him in their complete absorption in a comedy Tim was enacting . He was brandishing the bologna , striking anyone within reach . They ducked , bumped into one another , and scrambled , squealing , out of his way . Runty watched him coldly . He approached the bar , and put one foot on the rail . Tim did not wait for him to order . With a whoop he swung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulders . It was at that moment that Runty lunged at him and drove a knife through his chest . Tim straightened convulsively , then slumped forward and slipped to the floor . He rolled over on his back , and his eyes , puzzled and hurt , stared straight into Runty 's . He seemed to be asking a question . But before it could be answered he was dead . In that instant of startled , breathless silence , somebody cried out , " Where 'd he get the butcher knife ? " and then , " Why did he do it ? " Runty , staring down , went cold all over . Where had he got the butcher knife ? He could answer that . Why had he done it ? He could not answer that .
