THE LONELY LADY OF DULWICH-Maurice Baring-Knopf ( $2 ) . <P> <P> Maurice Baring is old-school without being oldfashioned . Urbane without pomp , sentimental but only sensibly so , he has the happy faculty of appearing as a citizen of the world without showing off the labels on his baggage . His latest novel , The Lonely Lady of Dulwich , is a little book ( 150 pages ) but it compasses a full human career without skimping . Deliberately , nostalgically reminiscent , it has the small fragrance of an old sachet . <P> Zita was a Victorian beauty who married a solid Englishman , a gentleman though a banker . He buried her in the country , never thought about her amusement . As mutely Victorian as he , she was unhappy but would not have admitted it . When business settled them in Paris , life began to look up for Zita . She had her portrait painted , met a young French poet who fell Gallically in love with her . At the last minute their elopement fell through ; Zita was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the poet was no longer a temptation . Instead , Zita fell ridiculously and tragically in love with a vulgar journalist . She told him the story of her life ; he sent it to a U. S. newspaper as a Sunday feature story . Her husband immediately got a separation . The journalist married someone else . Zita settled down to be an old lady by herself , took her unresigned but Victorian heart to the grave .
