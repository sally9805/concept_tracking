A SEA ISLAND LADY- Francis Griswold- Morrow ( $3 ) . <P> The publishers of A Sea Island Lady were sufficiently confident of its future to run off four printings ( 11,300 copies ) in advance of publication date , to set aside $3,500 for publicity , to blurb its heroine as " unforgettable . " To early readers of the novel it was evident that this confidence was going to be abundantly justified , for two large reasons : 1 ) that the U. S. book-buying public is by large majority composed of women , and : 2 ) that it would be hard to imagine a book better qualified to delight that majority . <P> Subsidiary reasons : A Sea Island Lady is 964 pages long and weighs 2 Ibs. 10 oz . It is written in that tireless , fluescent , infallibly platitudinous language which commonly passes for " literature , " and in whose terms Joyce , in Ulysses , created Gerty MacDowell. * <P> After 260 pages of ingratiating and painful romance , in the reliably glamorous Civil War-Reconstruction setting , Heroine Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for 700 pages and 60 years more , to live out the whole vast length of her life , the trivial with the towering , the bitter with the sweet , as the essential Perfect Woman ; married , raising a family , standing at the center of its vicissitudes , learning , at the end , to " believe at last with whole heart in all the dark splendor , all the terrible beauty of the world . " Her flawless marriage darkens and dulls , her bachelor friend is lost to death , found again in spirit , her husband dissolves into alcohol and she brings him through , her daughter dies in childbed , the Lusitania sinks , the promising son turns out disappointingly , Harding is elected , widowed Emily Fenwick meets old age . . . . <P> Though A Sea Island Lady never in any direction exceeds what its audience can take , it rarely eases up short of that . Within those limits it is extraordinarily warm , full , and actual , and by bulk alone gathers an enormous and serene momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate as air . To the proper reader , Emily Fenwick becomes a useful magic mirror for solace , nostalgia , future-gazing , and self-comparison . <P> In a letter , Joyce describes the style as " namby-pamby jammy marmalady drawersy. . . .
