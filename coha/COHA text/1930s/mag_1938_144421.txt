BEYOND DARK HILLS-Jesse Stuart- Dutton ( $3.50 ) . <P> Four years ago a poetic gusher called Man with a Bull-Tongue Plow , which consisted of 703 sonnets written in eleven months , called attention to a new U. S. poet : a six-foot , 207-lb. , 30-year-old Kentucky hillbilly named Jesse Stuart . In those poems , as in his book of stories that followed two years later ( Head o ' W-Hollow ) , Jesse Stuart wrote prolifically , ingenuously , sometimes amazingly well about his mountain kinsfolk , neighbors and scenery . <P> A vivid autobiography , published last week , proved that he could write even better on at least two other themes-his physical strength and his poetic talent . His muscle he traces to his pioneer ancestors , all over six feet , feudists , boozers , moonshiners , hard workers , preachers . Biggest and lustiest of these was Grandfather Mitch Stuart , who fought for the North because the Union recruiting station was nearer , who narrowly escaped hanging by his own men for killing a fellow soldier , fathered 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was past 80 . As an old man , Grandpa Stuart scandalized a spiritualist meeting by yelling : " Come out , all you dead babies and have a drink on old Mitch Stuart ! " <P> Of his childhood , Author Stuart remembers rabbit-hunting first , hard work next . At nine he hired out to a well-to-do farmer for 25 a day . From eleven to 15 he stopped school to cut corn and timber , work on a paving gang . In high school he licked hell out of a 200-lb. bully . At 18 , after running away with a carnival , he worked in a Birmingham steel mill . At Lincoln Memorial , a mountain college in Tennessee , he almost killed a hazer the first day , again licked the school bully , was editor of the college literary magazine . At Vanderbilt University he worked his way through ( seven hours a day ) and got along for months on one meal a day . As principal of the Greenup County High School he put the fear of God into the town toughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know where the poetic streak in his family comes from ( his 21-year-old brother , James , and his 16-year-old sister write too ) . He can only record how many poems he wrote , not how he wrote them or where they came from . But they have been coming for a long while . As a kid he went coon hunting with a lantern and a volume of Burns , read poetry by lantern light until the dog 's barking signaled a treed coon . <P> Nearest he comes to tracing the course of his creative processes is when he divulges that working in a steel mill made him decide that Carl Sandburg 's poems about the beauty of steel were phony , and that he went away cured of wanting to imitate Robert Burns . In the end he confesses what readers of Man with a Bull-Tongue Plow long ago guessed : " I was not mastering poetry but it was mastering me. "
