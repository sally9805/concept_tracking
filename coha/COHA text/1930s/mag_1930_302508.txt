Illinois politics , intraparty and interparty , divide between industrial wet Chicago and agricultural dry Down-State , win Down-State votes , to defeat Senator Charles Samuel Deneen for the Republican senatorial nomination in next April 's primary election , Congresswoman Ruth Hanna McCormick , Mark Hanna 's daughter , widow of Senator Medill McCormick , set out last week none too confident of success . <P> First thing against her in her southern campaign was the weather . Dense fog , icy roads kept many from her meetings in Mattoon After , leaving a tiny audience at Olney , she found that the flooding Wabash had made her motor useless , had stopped railway passenger service to Newton , her next stop . She borrowed a section handcar , started off over the rails . Overtaken by a freight train , she and her party hustled the handcar off the tracks clambered into the caboose , huddled around a small wood-stove with the conductor and brakeman until they trundled into Newton . <P> In southern Illinois , Mrs. McCormick found husbandmen , after lean years , interested chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nations or the World Court . She spoke of a compromise tariff helpful to farmer and industrialist alike . What made Mrs. McCormick glum was the discovery of a widespread prejudice against a woman in the Senate . Added this was the covert opposition of many Illinois women to her because of what they considered her politically autocratic manner . Said she : " I hope nobody will vote for me simply " because I am a woman or vote against me solely because I am a woman . " <P> But if Mrs. McCormick felt glum at the prospects , she was not going to admit it to the husbandmen who listened to her speeches nor to the representatives of the press who plied her with questions . She told one and all that her campaigning so far had been " perfectly delightful . " After a speech at Carmi , she remarked : " I have spoken to an average of 1,200 persons since I started at Shelbyville last Monday and the reception has been extraordinary . " Many of the " 1,200 " had plowed through deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Mrs. McCormick , it was conceded , had a less than even chance to defeat Senator Deneen . Chicago , with its machine , probably would go Deneen . Down-State might go McCormick unless Newton Jenkins , third candidate , managed to split the vote . The Chicago Tribune ( " World 's Greatest Newspaper " ) , part-owned by Col. Robert Rutherford McCormick , brother-in-law of the candidate , had not committed itself beyond regretting the lack of a wet candidate . Should a wet Democrat arise , the Tribune might support him . Should he not , and should Mrs. McCormick be nominated , it might support her , although , as she has most carefully pointed out , no Tribune stock belongs to her . Even so , Chicagoans were surprised at the coolness of Brother-in-law Robert 's potent paper toward Sister-in-law Ruth 's candidacy .
