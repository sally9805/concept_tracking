Bishop James De Wolf Perry of Rhode Island , primate of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America , paused at Chicago last week after an inspection of his Church 's status in the Midwest . In view of Roman Catholicism 's westering trend ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) , the kernel of his observations was interesting . " Being equidistant between the Atlantic and Pacific , " said he , " Chicago naturally crystallizes the attitude and thinking of the whole country . I consider the middle west the strategic centre of the future , not only for the church and organized religion generally , but for education as well . "
