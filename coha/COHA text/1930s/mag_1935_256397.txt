For the first time since the War , Germany last week found herself with an army and a War Minister . Celebrating the official promulgation of Germany 's new conscription law , handsome grey-haired Lieut . General Werner von Blomberg dropped his title of Reichswehr ( Realm 's Defense ) Minister and reassumed the pre-War title of Kriegsminister ( Minister of War ) . The Reichswehr , too , dropped that name , which it has never liked , to become again Germany 's Heer . To cap the day , Kriegsminister von Blomberg performed a little ceremony . He went out to the Invaliden Cemetery , laid wreaths on the graves of two significant heroes of Prussia 's wars against Napoleon Bonaparte : General Gerhard von Scharnhorst , who introduced universal compulsory military training into Prussia , and General Hermann von Boyen , who beat French restrictions on the size of the Prussian Army by training successive batches of reserves for short periods . <P> Just how the new conscript law works was explained last week by youthful General Walter von Reichenau , a potent staff officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ages of 18 and 45 is available for conscription . In wartime , women , too , can be drafted for special service . <P> Normally , at the age of 20 , male conscripts will be called up for a full year of active service . Before that , however , they must have served a term in the Labor Service . After his year of active service the conscript is transferred to the First Reserve in which , until he is 35 , he must assemble for annual inspections and reviews , serve at various times in maneuvers with active troops . From 35 to 46 he becomes a member of the Landwehr or Second Reserve , not to be called out except in times of national emergency but still liable for annual inspections . <P> Under the new law , the navy and air force will become corps d ' lite , manned entirely by four-year volunteers . <P> No pure-blooded Jew may serve in Germany 's conscript army but in time of war he may be given the honor of dying for his country . A-special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' part Jews " but these can never hope to rise even as high as corporal . <P> As in the old Reichswehr , no soldier in active service may marry without his commanding officer 's permission , nor may he marry a Jewess or other than Aryan . Those even in the reserve who do so will lose their military rank . German citizens living in foreign countries are still liable for conscription . Pure-blooded Jews , criminals and the morally unfit are excluded from active service . The only ones exempted from military service are candidates for the Catholic priesthood who have already received at least a subdeacon 's ordination . Unlike the old Prussian Army , officered exclusively by aristocrats , every conscript will have an equal chance at an officer 's commission . Thus a new order of self-made soldiers will be introduced into the old Army setup of Kaiser Wilhelm .
