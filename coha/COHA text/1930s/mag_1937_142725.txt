As remarkable as the sudden rebellious uprising in which pork-loving Congressmen had threatened to tear the Administration 's Relief Bill apart only the week prior ( TIME , June 7 ) , was the willingness with which most of them toed the Administration mark last week . <P> When the bill first came up , a fierce battalion of pork-seekers took it to a committee-of-the-whole and earmarked $505,000,000 for flood and drought control , roads and public works . A hot battle began . With earmarkers in control , the House began to approve pork amendments one after the other . Baring their teeth , they passed an amendment knocking $2,000 off Relief Administrator Harry Hopkins ' $12,000 salary . Administrator leaders had to filibuster to keep the earmarked bill from being passed . Finally , assured by Leader Rayburn that he had just talked with the President and could promise " an adjustment fair to every man , to every section , to every project , " the rambunctious House agreed to put the bill aside for a week . <P> Just what was done for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interim , no one would say definitely when the bill was taken up again one day last week . But that something had been done was immediately evident . Alabama 's Joe Starnes , flood control bloc leader , let it be known that he had " positive assurance " that there would be flood control pork , earmarking or no earmarking . New York 's Alfred Beiter declared the Public Works bloc had done " better than we bargained for . " Texas ' Marvin Jones did not conceal his opinion that he would get much more than he had asked for his drought control . Only Oklahoma 's Wilburn Cartwright , who wanted his pork in the form of road construction , was still fighting for his amendment . <P> When these confident expressions got around to Minority Leader Bertrand Snell , he took the floor for a shot at the White House : " It seems to me . . . that the final analysis of his whole proposition is the President agrees he will spend practically the same amount of money as the members have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is true . . . why does the President object to Congress earmarking the money and insist on reserving to himself the right to earmark it ? " Another shot was added by Mr. Snell 's New York colleague John Taber : " This bill was full of pork when it came out of the White House . It was full of pork when it came out of the committee , and it is full of pork now . " <P> These shots might as well have been saved , for the House was assembled this time to pass the bill that the Administration wanted and it voted overwhelmingly to stay in session until it did so . Taking the usual 40 minutes for each roll call , the House went doggedly on into the night before a crowded gallery. * With roll call after roll call , the earmarking amendments were knocked out one by one until , when the final vote was taken , not even the amendment to reduce Administrator Hopkins ' salary remained . <P> *After this tiring session , longest of the present Congress only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas began agitating for a mechanical vote-recording device in the House .
