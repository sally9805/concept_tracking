Busy taking an interest in housing last week were the King of England ( see p. 25 ) , the Duke of Windsor ( see col. 1 ) and Joseph Stalin . <P> Under the patronage of the Dictator , co-operative bodies of Soviet citizens have obtained loans from the State aggregating 80% to 90% of the capital required for the many apartment houses they have built throughout Russia , most of , these loans being repayable over 60 years . In all , the State has loaned its cooperative citizens more than 1,500,000,000 rubles , or at the State 's official figure $300,000,000 . <P> The Dictator 's interest in housing led him to conclude last week that this has been a mistake . Decrees went forth from the Kremlin informing the co-operatives that they have not 60 years but six months in which to complete repayment . This was the Dictator 's way of saying that the State will seize the housing . " The 1,500,000,000 rubles of State funds which have been loaned to the co-operatives . " declared the Kremlin 's official communiqu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cooperatives , who thus at the expense of the State became privileged owners of living space , with insignificant investments of their own . " <P> Those who knew anything about Soviet housing could have told the Dictator any time in the past several years that such has been the case , but it is characteristic of Joseph Stalin 's most drastic decrees that they are usually issued with a tone of just having learned the awful truth . Last week 's decree ends one of the last , most treasured private rights of many Soviet citizens , that of being masters in their own homes to the extent that they have had a voice in a collective which was master . Hereafter control passes to the local Soviet , thus to the party , and the ordinary Russian is now going to find the question of his lodging turning on his political standing as a citizen faithful to Stalinism . <P> Commissars and high party officials still need loans from the State for the private houses and estates they are building or have built in imitation of Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's decree last week , while abolishing loans to cooperatives , carefully guards the housing rights of Communist bigwigs and anyone else who can get permission from a local Soviet to build himself a private house . Armed with such permission , on which the project must be certified as a " small house " ( what constitutes " small " being undefined ) , the fortunate Communist can still apply for and get a five-year building loan from the State bank .
