NEW YEAR 'S GREETING A STORY BY MARGARET CULKIN BANNING T HERE can be something very glum about the approach of a new year . It may be the new leaf and the fresh adventure and all that , but it is also more of the same . It is the old adventure too , turned just a little soggy . The new year may have promises in one hand and the other hand may be full of threats , penances , and over-due bills . Sometimes the old year looks so much safer , until it can seem almost like a refuge . And at least it always keeps people a year younger . To Coralie Crandall the new year promised , as she looked at it , more fights ahead and criticism which even being in love was less and less able to sweeten . John Crandall only saw twelve more months with skids under them waiting for him . He supposed he 'd slip a little farther backward . He knew that going off to New York for the holidays did not seem very kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But let them . It would be better for both of them if he got away for a week or two . And it was n't as if the trip were costing anything . Then there was Kay Mercer , keyed to intensity beneath her lovely , imperturbable exterior , who saw a year approaching in which futility might reach its peak , giving her possession of still more things that always seemed to lose value at her touch . A hundred people might call " Happy New Year " to each of these three and it would not make any difference , though Coralie would be sure to answer gaily enough . To each of them the new year was going to be a load , and they knew it . Sidney Mercer , who was Kay 's husband , felt more or less that way himself . By the afternoon of New Year 's Eve he was tired of hearing people say , " Well , the new year certainly must look pretty good to you , Sid . You 've fallen on your feet all right They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who got an increase of salary during the depression . " And at every such statement he had to grin thankfully . He could not let down his own promotion , or the firm , by any lack of return enthusiasm or by showing that he was not too eager to submit himself to the strain . Hobson had cracked under it , and that was why Sidney in turn had been given his big , high-salaried  --  and expensive  --  chance to make good or crack too . Somebody had to take Hobson 's place , though of course at a decreased salary . So now Sidney had charge of the New York end of the business instead of the Middle-Western one , and Kay had already gone to New York to settle the apartment there , or at least to do as much settling as was necessary or feasible in a fourteen-room and four-bath furnished apartment that had been perfected by a famous interior decorator . In other words , Kay had seen that their trunks were unpacked and their clothes put away and had ordered fresh flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past month  --  over Christmas  --  and had come back to Clarion only for a directors ' meeting of one of the subsidiary companies and to clean up a few details . He was all through now , and if he had crowded things a little more he could have reached New York that night by plane . But he had not tried to do it . It would have meant an awkward evening , either saying a great many commonplace things , or more probably not saying them , because Kay would prevent him by her expression . She had said that she did not particularly want to celebrate ( and her voice had flung the word into quotation marks ) their first New Year 's Eve in New York . This would let her out . At first Sidney had thought he would join their old crowd in Clarion and make a night of it . That was what he really had in mind when he stayed over . But he felt less and less like doing it . The hole that their leaving had made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything cordial had been done for them before they left town . Re had been a guest at several banquets in his own honor . He and Kay had been given farewell dinners by everyone who belonged to their intimate circle . Kay had said once that they must be sure not to outstay their farewell . Something like that , he guessed , had been in her mind when he asked her if she did not want to come west with him again and spend this New Year 's Eve in Clarion . She had answered , " No thanks , dear . It would have all the makings of an anticlimax . I think I 'll stay here and enjoy my new lease on  --  the fourteen rooms . " She had said it in that hiddenmeaning way of hers and he had asked , looking about him at still unfamiliar furniture , " Do n't you think we 're going to be very comfortable ? " " It would be pretty wasteful not to be , considering the rent , " she answered lightly . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be happier here . " " We 've more space to be happy in , " she agreed , " and then it 's so much nearer heaven on the twentieth floor . " " Clarion was a grand town but it was kind of played out for both of us . " " Well , we gave it quite hard wear , " Kay said . It was so hard for him to tell what she thought or whether she secretly minded the uprooting . She disliked commonplace signs of feeling and rarely used or wore them . This was not their first change of home since their marriage . Sidney had been doing increasingly well with every post the company had entrusted to him . But they had lived in Clarion for six years of their married life , and it certainly had been a wrench for him to leave . He knew every inch of the River golf course and made it in eighty-six usually . He liked the Town Club , with its four o'clock Saturday after-. noon bridge game . And they had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , when the time came to go , Kay had n't made any fuss . She never did fuss about the things women were expected to make a row about , like leaving a home . It was that detachment in her which had first attracted Sidney . Most women were all over the place , telling you what they thought they thought . But Kay did n't tell anything that was n't necessary . She did n't complain . He had seen her sorrow when their child died , but he had n't heard her complain . But she did n't offer comfort either . Sidney was proud of her . He never tired of her beauty , and he could always count on her good taste in every respect , and certainly on her loyalty . It was only lately  --  perhaps because he was so tired  --  that he wished sometimes she were a little warmer , that in a way she would loosen up . There was a kind of petting other men seemed to get from their wives which he sometimes coveted . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hardly went so far as a wish . It was a lack . He heard other women telling less important men what wonderful fellows they were and pitying them for working less hard than he did . But , when he spoke to Kay of what a stiff job this new one was going to be , she had agreed and asked him what he planned to do about getting enough exercise . It was intelligent understanding , of course , but he could use something more than that . There was not , Sid thought now , as he went over the possibilities , much point in going out to the club to-night after all . There 'd be the usual riotous party there . But he wanted to keep himself in good shape for his work . Of course his old crowd would welcome him . They would all be glad to have an extra man , but he did not feel like taking on Nell or Mildred and giving them a slightly intoxicated good time . Nell was a beautiful dancer , but that was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same women that kind of time last year . He did not know exactly what he wanted but he was sorry for himself as he turned to the elevator with a sudden decision to go up to his hotel sitting-room , read a while , and go to bed . " Twelfth floor , " he said to the operator . That was as high as the best hotel went in Clarion . The operator waited . A young woman was hurriedly coming across the lobby . She was very pretty and smart-looking at a little distance andthen , close up , not quite so smart but even prettier . What had Kay said about clever women never showing their beauty to strangers ? This girl could n't be clever . For she fairly flung her beauty at Sidney , at the elevator operator , and at the middle-aged woman in the back of the cage as she drew a half-panting breath . " Thanks for waiting , " she said to the elevator boy and smiled at Sidney . He smiled too , but increased the distance between them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had lost the company of the middle-aged woman on the way up , and the girl started to get off at Sidney 's floor , stepped back and did not seem to be sure of what to do . " Radio Station ? " she asked the boy at the lever . " You have to walk up a flight to the roof , miss . " Sidney , bowing his apology for their confused exit , gave her an opportunity to turn away first , but she hesitated after the elevator had clanged its gate and gone down . " Is that the stairway that goes to the radio station , Mr. Mercer ? " The use of his name surprised him and also put him under a vague obligation to be friendly . Probably she worked in some office he used to frequent . " I think so . " " Oh , yes , there 's the sign . " " Are you going to broadcast ? " " I 'm going to try . It 's just sing-ing . " " I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be critical , " she begged , making a favor of it . " I 'm awfully out of practice . probably be terrible ! " She hurried up the stairs , and Sidney went to his room . Of course he had no intention of listening to her . He turned on a few lights , found a cigar , and gave the incident full opportunity to drift out of his mind . But the girl 's eagerness and her natural friendliness seemed to stick there . There had been a speaker attached to the radio in his room when he had taken it and he had left it there , because sometimes it was a good way to pick up market reports and also because there was a favorite entertainer or two he liked to listen to . After a few minutes he turned the dial to the local station , just to see what her singing was like , bow " terrible " it would be . The announcer was saying , " Mrs. John Crandall  --  known to many or you as Coralie Lutes will sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " So that was who the girl was . She was the one Jack Crandall had married . Sidney remembered something to the effect that the Crandalls had been tried socially and found impossible as a couple , though Crandall himself had been a member of one of the city 's leading families . It had been a complication in a set slightly younger than that of Kay and Sidney . The girl had been of no importance and Crandall had made a sensation out of marrying her and gone around town pretending that he did not care what people thought . Sidney always suspected that he did care . He did n't like Crandall very well anyway , with his underslung pipe , and his indifference of superiority , and his bundle of bad debts . A fellow with a start like his ought to have made more of himself . Whoever the girl was , she had n't got much of a break , thought Sidney . Crandall had probably never earned a cent in his life , and now that the Crandall estate was on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a foolish song , one of those deliberately fox-trotting melodies which depends on two or three tingling little measures . The words had neither wisdom nor beauty , the tune stole phrases from an old melody . And yetthere was a caress to the whole thing , like the touch of a cool , slim arm . It was relaxing . It expected nothing of anyone . It gave the little it had . She sang it in the blues manner first , sliding and exaggerating the words , then she hummed it , then she let the music make her hearers guess at the words , and finally she sang it like a tuneful child . It was her whole performance . She had ten minutes , and Sidney Mercer listened to all of them . When someone , barking about a sale of fur coats , had replaced her on the air he was sorry . He had an impulse to tell her how much he had enjoyed it and turned to the telephone to call the radio station . Then he remembered that she would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do the human thing once in a while ? Why not step out there and tell her ? So he stopped her in the corridor . She was flushed and delighted now that the thing was over and childishly grateful for his praise . " You really did like it ? " " I certainly did . I wish I could tune in on you oftener . " " It 's the first time I 've been on the air in a long while . I used to sing over the radio before I was married , at the old station , but I have n't done it for a long time . My husband 's away just now , and I did n't have anything else to do so I said I would when they asked me to fill in . Not that he 'd have minded , " she added with a quick and apparently conscientious explanation . " I 'm sure he would have been very proud of you . " A question crossed her face . Every thought showed openly upon it . Sidney could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a secret , like Kay . " Well , at least it was something to do , " she said . " Funny , though , to spend New Year 's Eve singing to a lot of people you ca n't see . " " And now you celebrate , I suppose . " " No , I go home to bed . " " That does n't seem right . " She said , " It seems insane ! " He laughed and let another impulse have its head . " Maybe we might find something to do together . " She considered as she looked at him . " What ? " " You 'd have to decide that . Anything you like . People eat and dance usually , do n't they ? There 's probably something going on in the grill downstairs Or , " he hesitated a second and said , " we might go out to the Town CI ub . " After all , on New Year 's Eve no one would pay much attention to them . " Let 's begin here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any supper . I was afraid to eat because of my voice . Pd like to . But how do you happen to be here , Mr. Mercer ? I thought you 'd moved to New York and taken a house on Wall Street or something . " " Well , I have moved to New York , " he explained , " but I had to come out here again on business . And Mrs. Mercer did n't care to make the trip . " It was an hour later in New York but still not yet the New Year . Kay Mercer , who was not waiting for it , wished none the less that it would hurry . She thought it was all nonsense , this excitement about a change in the calendar , but at the same time it aroused even in her a sense of impatience . She felt conscious of all the waiting , of the deliberate climax people were building up . She had meant to go to bed early but she knew that she would not be able to sleep . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung , easily and generously , on brass hinges . The street below was adrift with automobiles just as it had been when shelooked down at it the last time . She wondered what all that peacelessness was going to do to her and if it would destroy and obliterate her . Opposite , across the avenue , were the mullioned windows of another apartment , within a stone 's throw and forever sealed to her . It gave her a horrid sense of being anonymous , of counting for nothing . She regarded herself critically . She knew she was a beautiful ( but not amazingly so ) , useless ( though of course she did what she could to make Sid comfortable and what any other woman probably could do as well ) , intelligent ( but untalented ) woman of thirty-two . That was the way Kay was . Her mind never refused qualifications . She did n't trust overstatements . That was why she could never let herself go , even in loving Sidney . She did n't want to run the risk of becoming absurd or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and then less . That was what happened to everyone . She could not help it . It was dreadful , pitiful , but it was true , and the only protection was not to fool herself . She must be ready for that slackening of feeling so that there would be no melodrama when it came , no perceptible change in the way they lived or in their behavior to each other . She was a perfectionist . To-night she had dined alone but she had spent twenty minutes trying to get her hair into exactly the right curves . It was not vanity that drove her but that artist cruelty that pursued her and found its release in such small things . She would spend just as much time on an emotion . She tried to be perfect in her attitude toward Sidney . It was wretched in a way , this being dragged round the country , but she felt that she had no right to complain . Sidney had his roots in his business . She had no roots anywhere . Now that they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well taken care of . She had fourteen beautiful rooms to live in and she had come from a muskrat coat to a mink one . She could n't explain to Sidney that , in spite of all the money he spent on her , she still felt as if she owned nothing . She would n't stand in the way of his progress . But there was no use in liking people too much in a city like Clarion , when living there was sure to be impermanent . And there was no use in liking people here at all . She looked at the street flooded with automobiles . While she had been standing there probably every passion in the world had sped by below and none had touched her . " Who is it , Eric ? " she asked . Eric , the butler , was at the door . He was one of the servants who had been furnished with the apartment . " There are some ladies and gentlemen calling , madam . Quite a number . " " Did n't they give their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a New Year 's call . Mr. Trent is there . " " Yes , " said Kay , clear in her mind as to what such a call meant . They were a lot of people making the rounds on New Year 's Eve . " I 'll see them . Say that I am at home . " She would have to be decent to Ross Trent since his father was the largest stockholder in Sidney 's firm . He had looked her over at a dinner at his father 's house given in honor of Kay and Sidney , and she had felt him measuring her possibilities against a possible new thrill for him . He seemed a very tiresome man to her , the kind of man who no doubt liked to be in snapshots on society pages . " Probably , " she said tolerantly to Sid , " he 's just a necessary phase of evolution . But I do not like to have anyone look at me with that ' lc ) , the pretty milkmaid ' look in his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was satisfied that she looked as she did to-night , not overdressed but not too informal . The blue velvet of her dress was dark as the depth of a lake and untrimmed , with long , tapering sleeves . Her face tapered too . It began with the fair width of her brow and her grave , inscrutable gray eyes and then delicately narrowed . She was ridiculously thin , almost unsubstantial . And she looked confident . But that was not true . It was only that she knew perfectly what was awkward and unsuitable . Now , with these people Ross Trent had brought to see her she was gay as well as courteous . But she did not welcome them as if they had been guests she had invited . They had come for drinks and to see what she looked like , and she gave them both privileges . It was far too subtle a reservation for most of them . Trent did not know he was being snubbed ever so delicately . But the young man with tallow hair and a thin , half-exhausted face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , " he said to Kay after a few minutes . " A New Year 's guest , " she answered pleasantly . " If you 've written a book , I probably have n't read it and I 'm sorry . " " No  --  I 'm a neighbor from Clarion . My name is John Crandall . " " Why , of course , " she said , " I knew your face was familiar . I 'm especially glad to see you again . I do n't believe I ever met you out there ? it was a different group , yours  --  younger . " " You mean the gang that dropped me . For the last few years Clarion society has been getting along nicely without any help or hindrance from me . But I 've seen you here and there in crowds , and it 's really always been a lift . " " Thank you . " " This is a beautiful place you 've found to live in . " " Is n't it ? " she agreed with detachment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said indifferently , " not much . " " Shall I lure them away ? " She said , " Could you ? " " I do a very good imitation of Pan . But perhaps you 've heard that . " " Perhaps I did n't listen . I 'd be sorry to see you go anyway . " " I could come back if I were asked . " She looked him over and considered his idea . " It 's New Year 's Eve and we might see whether there 's anything amusing in this city of copyists , " he suggested . " But you may want to lock your doors and go to bed and keep the New Year out . " " No  --  I ca n't sleep . The thing that threatens always makes me nervous . " " Jumpy , " he said ; " me too . Forcing its way in everywhere . It 's like this crowd . Who asked it ? Who wanted it ? " " So you feel that way too ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I should join forces for the next few hours . Till the New Year 's blown over . " Eric brought in another tray . But it was the last one . Kay amusedly watched John Crandall see to that . He had a way of putting the whole party under his arm , crumpling it up and stuffing it in his pocket . Then he took it away , and she never asked him what be did with the hilarious company . She was more curious about him than about them . But she did not ask questions . She would not even presume upon the unusualness of the incident at first , after he came back , after she wrapped the mink coat about the dark-blue velvet dress and they went out together . " We must get settled , " he insisted , " before this New Year comes upon us . We 've still got forty minutes . But suppose it should catch us in the street or when I was paying a taxi-driver and had my back turned . I do n't want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving her apartment and coming back he had evidently made a plan . She left decision to him and soon found herself in a small upstairs restaurant on a side street . It was an unhurried , musicless place , and she thought it did not look expensive and was relieved by that . From what she had casually heard , John Crandall was always up against it for money . " There 's not a paper hat or a balloon in the place , " he boasted . " It 's a hide-out , " she said ; " the New Year will never find it . " " If it does we 'll throw it out . " She told him that she would have a chicken sandwich , but he would not be content with that . " No , please . Let 's have something that takes a long while to cook and eat . They do things pretty well here in chafing dishes . If that chicken sandwich is an economy measure , let me tell you that New York is n't costing me as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to come on and see her before she died . Now she is so revived or horrified by seeing me that she is n't going to die . But she made it the occasion for giving me a great deal of advice and a little money . Also I play much better bridge than your friend Ross Trent . So you do n't have to worry . " He said it teasingly , and it was so long since she had been teased that she flushed and was lovelier than ever . " Then order some long-winded dish like lobster Newburgh with lots of melba toast , " she told him . He consulted with the waiter and sent him away . Kay leaned on her elbows and wondered why she was with a stranger in this unknown place . And they both became a little hesitant because it was easier to get this far than to go any farther . " Why are you hiding from the new year ? " he asked . " I should think you 'd be on the welcome committee . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " " Could n't you use it being beautiful ? " " So many people do that better than I can . " " Not much better . " " Oh , yes . Thousands of women . Good looks are n't rare . And I do n't think they 're very powerful . There are n't so many things you can do with beauty when you get right down to it . " " So you 're intelligent as well as lovely , " said Crandall . " As well as useless . " " You do n't mean you 've a yen for a career ? You 're not one of those job-crazy women ? " " Not a career . I might like work but I should n't want a fake job . I just wish I were something . " Shc went on , past her own silence , saying it to her own surprise . " Sometimes it 's like being afraid of vanishing . Perhaps I should vanish because I 'm not either important or necessary . " He watched her curiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . But that 's because he 's made up his mind to believe something else . " " You could easily be important to other men , " he said , " but I suppose that 's out ? " " Yes , that 's out . I should hate everything about it , the confusion , the imitation feelings . I do n't like using feelings that belong to other people . I like my own things . " " Then why are n't you satisfied as you are ? " " Did you ever feel worthless ? " " I ? I always feel worthless , " said John Crandall , " and sometimes improve on that . As you must have heard , I not only do not do what I should but usually do what I should n't . And there is more to it than that , more than even Clarion knows yet . I do n't even do what I should n't successfully . " " What do you mean ? " " I do what I please because I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " " That 's a pity . " " It 's brutal sometimes . " She guessed of course that he was thinking of his wife . " You see , " be went on , " I ca n't decide what to do with this new year . I 've either got to give it a clout that will knock it out completely for me or else I 've got to argue with it for months . I know it will be irritating and I 've a rotten temper . lash out at it and it will hit back , and that sort of continual wrangling is n't civilized . " " No , " she said , " it is n't civilized but it 's human . " So it was true that he and his wife did n't get along very well . Kay had heard that . People said that the girl John Crandall married got on his nerves already , and some people did n't blame him and said that his passion for her was bound to lapse . She was quite a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock it out , " he said . " But how could you ? " " Oh , I could disappear . Not turn up where it expects me , " said Crandall . " That 's one way . " " You mean that you 'd make a fresh start somewhere else ? " " More likely it would be a stale ending , " he answered with contempt for himself ; " but at least I 'd do no more harm to anyone . I 'd take care to spend my time with people who were thoroughly harmed already . " She looked at his thin , nervous , sensitive face and wondered . Fragments of the gossip about him and his wife came out of her memory . He had been determined to marry the girl . He must have been deeply in love , for he 'd dropped his whole crowd , alienated his family , stopped studying law , and had even gone to work in a factory . But the factory had closed . " I wish I could help , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you 're not . I only wish I could hold on to this hour . I wish time would he decent enough to pause . I 'd like to keep you here just as you are , with your blue velvet dress and your secret gray eyes and your , mysterious , withheld companionship . " " Tell me , " she asked , " if you tried to escape from a new year would it pursue you ? " The waiter brought them a silvered , gleaming dish beneath which a flame was swaying . Coralie thought Sidney Mercer danced very well . " Yes , you really do , " she said , as they left the patch of dancing floor again . " You know I was surprised . I do n't mean that the way it sounds . It sounds like a slam , does n't it But what I mean is that I should n't have thought an important man like you would care a lot for dancing . " " So I 'm all right , am I ? " he asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wonderful , Mr. Mercer . " " I thought you were going to stop calling me that on New Year 's Eve . " She laughed excitedly . " I never knew a man called Sidney . I guess that 's why it 's hard to get used to it . " " You must practice , " he said . They were having no trouble at all being friendly . From the very first she had made that easy , even necessary . She had told him much about herself , one stray fact tacked on to another . He knew how many there were in her family , and that Joe was her favorite brother even if he could n't get along with his father , and that she hadbought the coat Sidney admired for thirty-nine fifty , which was a great bargain , though her husband seemed to think there was too much fur on it . " He likes such terribly plain things on me , " she said . She told him further that she adored creamed chicken but had never been able to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the funny thing . Raspberries did n't . She did n't think she was the type for sun-tan but she really thought dark skins were more aristocratic . The Crandall apartment , Sidney learned , was really quite comfortable , but John Crandall did n't like the people across the hall from them . " Of course I do n't think the woman 's quite a lady , myself . But she 's got a good heart . And , as I tell John , it takes all kinds of people to make a world . " Sidney talked about himself too . Subjects came up naturally . The reason he happened to know so much about the flavor of coffee was that he 'd sold coffee on the road when he was starting out . He had a good deal to say about those days . He mentioned too that tomatoes always disagreed with him , and she gave him her interested little frown at that distressing news . She wanted to know if he thought he 'd like New York , and he said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coralie said that she thought he was marvellous , to be picked to go to New York like that , and that he must be marvellous in his business . After she had repeated the word a few times Sidney began to feel more rested and energetic than he had in a long time . She was a cute little thing and she had a good head on her . He wondered if he was giving her as good a time as could be had and he asked if she would n't like to go somewhere gayer than the hotel to see the New Year come in . " There 's the club , " be suggested again . " No . That place brings me bad luck . I had an awful time there with John once . " She thought a moment . " There 's the King View Caf ? . It 's that Chinese roof garden . Of course you might n't like it in some ways , but the music 's wonderful . Everybody goes . " " Then why should we stay away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never suggested taking Kay there . They crossed the city in a taxi , and she sat quite close to him , as was evidently her habit in cars . He held her hand but there was a firm little air of virtue about her none the less . It made him dubious about kissing her . He was n't sure whether he should try it or not , and before he had made up his mind they reached the King View . There they ordered an almond and chicken concoction to placate the management for their use of the dance floor . Sidney enjoyed himself and his expert steps . " Having a good time ? " he asked and held her a little more to himself . She smiled up at him . " I thought it was going to be the most dreadful evening . I always think New Year 's Eve should be so gay . You know the way you begin a year counts for a lot . They say what you do on the first day is what you 're going to do all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home .

" Oh , I do n't know , " she said with sudden hardness ; " for all I know it may be Reno . " " Reno ? " " I 'm just talking to you , you know . I 'm not telling the world . But there comes a time when you wonder what there 's in it if you go on . I mean agirl does n't want to be a drag on a man , does she ? " " 1 ca n't imagine you being that . " " Well , you do your best and then sometimes that is n't good enough . " She slipped a little closer into his arms as if she would like to rest anywhere . " Poor kid , " he said . " Were you ever lonely ? " she asked . The music grew softer and the lights were lowered to a pale blue that haunted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night but for you . " " I think you 're grand . " " They do n't come much sweeter than you , " said Sidney . The lights went out . It was black for a minute but the darkness screamed with laughter and greetings . People clung to one another and hoped and promised , and met what for one excited , conscious moment was the future . Then the room was bright again . " Well , we 're off , " said Sidney with a little more gravity , for after all this was the year in which he had to make good in a big way . She was not looking at him . Then she did and there were tears in her eyes . " You know I 've simply got to tell somebody ! I 'm going to have a baby this year . " " That 's real luck , " said Sidney and pressed her hot little band . Then he added , " That being so , I think I 'd better take you home . " She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another taxi . Not very much to her maybe , but she was all right . His thoughts went back swiftly to Kay and the day she had told him they were going to have a child . Kay could never have told that news to a stranger . What a bad break all that had been for them , especially for her . He must make it up to her . He must make good now and get her everything she wanted . Lovely Kay . He should n't have left her alone to-night . He should have gone by plane . It had been a new year in New York for more than an hour . At the door of her apartment Kay was saying goodnight . The elevator had gone down . They were alone in the little vestibule with the Chinese panels . " Remember that you 've promised not to deny your value , Kay , " said John Crandall . " It 's bad for the standards of the worried world , you know . " He had been wondering how they were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did not know whether to touch her or not . Trying to kiss her would spoil the evening probably . She was , he thought as he looked at her , a beautiful , rare person but a little neurotic . She had nullified most of her natural impulses . She had been too critical of them , and now it was hard for her to feel easily , swiftly , and without reservations . She had to put everything into words , or silences . Coralie would have put the same things into the simple tenderness of her arms . Suddenly John Crandall 's nerves ached for Coralie . " I wish , " Kay was saying , " that I could say what I want to you . I 've been trying for hours . Anyway I 'm quite sure that you ca n't run away . The New Year has caught up with both of us and it 's really been very civil so far . " " All right , " he promised , " I 'll be civil myself . I 'll play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , Kay . " " Good-night . " He did not kiss her hand . He felt it would be a little theatrical . The elevator came at his ring and slid down the shaft again . When he was in the street he looked up at the great apartment building and wondered which was the twentieth floor and which were her lights . What would she do there alone ? Kay had already dropped the mink coat on the back of a carved Italian chair . She was in the library , by the nearest telephone . " Yes , " she said to the long-distance operator , " Clarion . That 's right . Will you get me Mr. Sidney Mercer at the Lake Hotel ? Or at the Town Club ? " She waited for them to call her back . She was impatient , for she knew what she wanted to say . She was glad she was married to a man who was n't full of uncertainties , who knew where he was going , who did n't stray . She wanted to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be unknown happiness in it . But she had to wait , for other people were telephoning greetings , crowding the wires with them . There was the girl in Clarion , who was sitting beside her telephone in pale-blue pajamas , humming the tune she had sung over the radio that night . She felt reckless at spending so much money on a long-distance call . But still she could pay for it herself out of what she had earned that night , and you only lived once , she thought to herself . " They say Mr. Crandall has n't come in yet ? " she repeated to the operator . " Well , he 'll be there . No , I do n't care how late it is . Keep on trying . "
