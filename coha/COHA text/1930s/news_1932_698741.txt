txt In another column will be found a letter from the vice president and sales manager of the Indiana Limestone Co. of Bedford , Ind. , In which exception is taken to this writer 's comments upon the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in a case involving the rates on Bedford stone to/Washington and Baltimore . The exception is to two points , both of which are covered In the following extract from Mr. Richter 's letter : " In the Interstate Conunerce Commission 's order No. 19656 in the O'Meara Case dated October 16 , 1929 , Mr. Woodlock , then a commissioner , concurring in part with the majority decision says : ' I concur in the conclusion of the majority that the assailed rates will for the future be unreasonable to the extent that they exceed 30 cents , but I can not concur in the finding that the maintenance of rates on rough stone which are more than 80% of the contemporaneous rates on dressed stone will be unduly prejudicial . ' " The purpose of this letter is to make the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supported the reduction from 37 cents to 80 cents in the rough stone rate from Bedford to Baltimore and now apparently be objects to that very same thing . Nor does he give the Interstate Commerce Commission credit for its present action of advancing the 80 cents reduced rate to 82 cents at this time . " In Effect , a Reduction Dealing , first , with the second of these points , it is to be observed that Mr. Richter omits to state the really essential point of the matter , namely , that the whole question of the rates on Bedford stone , reasonableness and prejudice , was before the Commission de novo , the case decided in October , 1929 , having been reopened for rehearing on all issues . This had the effect of bringing the original rates of 37 cents on rough and dressed stone before the Commission as if it wee the first time that they were brought in question . Now the decision Us bad the effect of reducing the 87-cent rate on rough stone to 32 cents . That this rate haipens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1929 case is entirely irrelevant , for by reopening that case for rehearing- on all issues the conclusion reached therein is as if it had never been rendered . The effect is that on March 81 , 1932 , the Commission decided that 82 cents was a maximum reasonable rate on this commodity in the light of all the circumstances of record , including the state of revenues of the carrier concerned , and the facts concerning the ability of the stone to move regardless of rate . It was that decision that this writer condemned . And those are the facts upon which his condemnation was based . It is possible that Mr. Richter overlooked the fact that the matter had been reopened on all issues . It is true , unfortunately , that this writer by an inexcusable blunder on his part , incorrectly stated the amounts of the new rates at 35 cents on dressed and 30 cents on rough instead of 37 cents on dressed and 32 cents on rough . But the force of his condemnation is not touched . General Eastern Reduction Likely That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 7 cents and that there is so reduction on dressed stone does not change the tact that rates and revenues were reduced by the decision , and that was the offense that the dissenting commissioners saw in it . Commissioner Lewis , for instance , said : " I am unable to find in the record any real evidence that the 37 ? cent rate was in fact higher than the transportation service to which it applied justified , and the majority report discloseenone . " Commissioner Mahaffie ( joined by Commissioner Meyer ) in saying the same thing , fiirther pointed out that " A. reduction under a Section 1 finding " ( unreasonableness ) " will probably lead to a general reduction throughout eastern territory . " So it probably will , if the commission follows innumerable precedents , and the logic that it has invariably used in these cases . If 32 cents is a " maximum reasonable " rate to Washington and Baltimore , and rates from the same origin to other eastern points are " out of line , " down they must come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This writer repeats that to reduce rates at present on traffic which can pay higher rates is not justifiable and that is all he said . October , 1929 , Not Relevant Touching the first point , namely , this writer 's " concurrence " in the reduction made in rough stone rates in October , 1929 , he disposes of it as follows : ? First , during his service with the Interstate Commerce Commission he made at least his full share  --  probably more  --  of mistakes , many of which he recognized only too late for remedy , and many more of which he has forgotten , if he ever recognized them , but all of which he confesses humbly and repentantly . The case in which he participated in October , 1929 , as accomplice is certainly one of those mistakes . He pleads guilty . However Second , October , 1929 , so far as this matter is concerned has no more relevance to March , 1932 , than would have October , 1066 , or whatever may have been the precise date of the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that this is 1932 , with all that that year of grace has brought us , which needs realization by both the Interstate Commerce Commission and shippers . It is commended to Mr. Richter 's attention .
