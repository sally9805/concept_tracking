Things to remember about the Harvard University Library , whose 3,800,000 books and pamphlets make it the largest university collection in the world and the third biggest collection in the U. S. , * are that it is not named the Widener Library as most of its patrons think and that it is not run by a professional librarian . Last week the second of these peculiarities disappeared as Historian Robert Pierpont Blake announced that he was turning over his job as director to Keyes Metcalf , Chief of the Reference Department of the New York Public Library . Lean , reserved , thoroughly professional Librarian Metcalf , 47 , who will also serve as college librarian , began his career as a page in the Oberlin College Library and graduated in 1914 from the New York Public Library training school . Broad , boy-faced Amateur Blake , 50 , wants more time for Byzantine history . <P> * First is the Library of Congress , second the New York Public Library .                @ @ @ @ @
