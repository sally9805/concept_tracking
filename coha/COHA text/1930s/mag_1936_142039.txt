Borrowing a campaign simile from Franklin Roosevelt , Secretary of Agriculture Wallace last fortnight compared his 1936 soil conservation program and forthcoming 1937 plan as follows : " The two will be as nearly alike as the 1937 and 1936 models of automobiles . We think we have perfected a new carburetor for the 1937 program . " <P> Last week Secretary Wallace put his 1937 model on display for farmers ' inspection . Costing the same $500,000,000 , it was basically identical with the apparatus whipped together last spring after the Supreme Court had ruled the AAAct off the road . As a reward for diverting their acres from " soil-depleting " crops ( cotton , wheat , corn , tobacco ) to " soil-building " crops ( alfalfa , soybeans , grasses ) , farmers will receive Federal bounties averaging slightly less than $10 per acre . Thus , by the back door of soil conservation , the New Deal will continue to achieve some production control of cash crops , which the Supreme Court has forbidden it to approach directly . <P> No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get at least $20 from the Government next year , as compared with a minimum $10 this year . Secretary Wallace said his " new carburetor " was an explanation of schedules by which each farmer could figure out his bounty in advance . But knowing newshawks pounced on a discreetly buried item in the announcement as the 1937 model 's new power source . <P> Fundamental difference between the AAAct and its current substitute is that under the former the farmer was bound by contract to reduce his cash crops by specified percentages . Now he reduces them voluntarily within Department of Agriculture specifications and is rewarded according to the extent of his cooperation . But to control next year 's corn crop , the Department last week proposed to set definite acreage limits , enforced by an extra reward and a penalty . <P> In those parts of Kansas and states of the North Central region where corn is the chief crop , farmers will be told how much corn to plant , get an extra 5% added to their soil-diversion bounty if they obey . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each extra acre . Thus the Department , fearing a surplus which would send corn and hog prices crashing , hopes to bring corn acreage from 1932-33 's 59,000,000 and last year 's 54-500,000 acres down to some 54,000,000 acres . Reluctant to discuss the matter . AAA legalites nonetheless conceded that this production control was quite as direct as that achieved under the AAAct . They expected to get away with it because of the obvious difficulty a complainant would have in getting the law into court for a test case . If it should escape the Supreme Court 's interdiction , the scheme could easily be extended to all the other cash crops which the AAAct was created to control . <P> Whether the New Deal and its farmer friends would long be satisfied with such roundabout methods remained a prime question . Red-hot for revival of the AAAct , Supreme Court or no Supreme Court , is the New Deal 's most potent rural friend , the American Farm Bureau Federation . To its convention in Pasadena last week , Secretary Wallace declared : " Good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . A better program can and will be built . "
