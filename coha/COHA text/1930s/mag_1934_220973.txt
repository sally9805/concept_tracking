A Sleeping Clergyman ( by James Bridie ; Theatre Guild , producer ) . James Bridie is a Glasgow physician named Mavor who writes his plays under a pseudonym because he fears Scottish patients might distrust a doctor who was also a dramatist . A Sleeping Clergyman is likely to arouse in Manhattan theatregoers a mild distrust of playwrights who are also physicians . In it , Author Bridie investigates three generations of a Glasgow family to demonstrate his theory that drunkards , murderers and trollops should be allowed to breed . He does so with such exhaustive Hibernian conscientiousness that the result sometimes seems more like a diagnosis than a play . <P> To speak of the Camerons as a family may be misleading for none of them is married . Charles Cameron I ( Glenn Anders ) gets his girl ( Ruth Gordon ) into trouble and dies of tuberculosis before he can marry her . She dies giving birth to Wilhelmina Cameron who grows up in the household of her maternal uncle Dr. William Marshall ( Ernest Thesiger ) . No sooner does she reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes pregnant by her guardian 's apprentice and murders him when he tries to stop her marriage to another man . After giving birth to twins , she jumps off a cliff . The twins ( Glenn Anders and Ruth Gordon ) are the specimens with which Author Bridie tries to prove his thesis . They are erratic in their youth , but the girl grows up to be a sardonic secretary to the League of Nations and the boy does even better . A taste for liquor and two bastards on his distaff side do not prevent Charles Cameron II from becoming what his grandfather started out to be , a distinguished scientist , who , in 1936 , invents a great serum against the plague . <P> The suspicion that Author Bridie is more scientist than writer is increased by a title which derives from the play 's vague prolog . While a cleric , possibly the symbol of Religion 's disinclination to interest itself in lively problems , dozes in a Glasgow club , two doctors indulge in shoptalk which the play unfolds . But if A Sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's audiences , it may have been largely because the Theatre Guild in the last 16 years has set itself a standard far higher than that of any other Manhattan producer . Its first contribution to the current season , honest and interesting if not always exciting , contains particularly good acting by Ruth Gordon and Ernest Thesiger ; a brief but crisp characterization by the Guilds perennial shrew , Helen Westley , returned from Hollywood successes ; a wild exhibit of deathbed histrionics by Glenn Anders . In the first scene he seems intent on convincing his audience that he has not tuberculosis but the galloping shakes . Order Please ( by Edward Childs Carpenter ; George Bushar &; John Tuerk , producers ) . This ludicrous concoction concerns itself with the adventures of a nave Wyoming rancher ( James Bell ) in a Manhattan hotel . He finds a dead man in the room next to his . When the body vanishes no one will believe his story because he has been seen downing four Martinis . While he shields from scandal an ornate lady with a foreign accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of a coat button , he is taken firmly in hand by a motherly little telephone girl ( Vivienne Osborne ) .
