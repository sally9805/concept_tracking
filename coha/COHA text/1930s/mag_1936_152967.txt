The Chinese cue was forced on the Chinese 292 years ago by their Manchu conquerors as a badge of subjection . Last December one of the last old-fashioned cues in the Orient , dangling from the head of the Inner Mongol leader , Prince Te , * Prince of West Sunit , bobbed in puppet subjection to gifts of Japanese cash &; guns . The Prince declared Inner Mongolia independent of the Chinese Government at Nanking . <P> Last week Nanking 's Premier and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek got a telegram from Inner Mongolia that cheered him . It purported to be from one Yun Chih-hsien , who claimed that he was leading a great rebellion against Prince Te . " My men are patriots , " Yun trumpeted , " and absolutely opposed to Prince Te 's pro-Japanese policy . " This might have meant much or nothing , but one thing Premier Chiang read plainly between the lines of the telegram : There would be no Inner Mongol rebellion unless Nanking forked out some cash for Yun . <P> *Chinese name . His Mongol name is Dam-chukdangrub. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
