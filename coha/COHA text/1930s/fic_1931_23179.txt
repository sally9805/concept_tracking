THE FIRST LOVER A STORY BY KAY BOYLE F OR over a month the music of their conversation had been gently rocking the pension to sleep . Out of the window behind their three fair heads rose the rocky hills of Beausoleil , so covered with little pink villas , with porcelain cats , and china turtles that the dignity of a bare rock rearing ugly as sin between the houses was enough to make the heart stand still . The three girls themselves were out of their own country with an elation signifying that everything that tasted unpleasant had been left behind . Such beautiful meals they were given in the pension , such fine things to eat , and the sunshine every day as lavish as rain . This was a vacation-time for them . This was the miracle of repose their father had given them for a little while . They filled it with rich excursions , hot chocolate in the afternoon and cakes , and with such a wealth of conversation with mere acquaintances , but still it was in their faces that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that lay behind them and , if they were young , still they had lived long enough to remember what the years and the times had done to their father . Professor Albatross and his fiery heart had been extinguished . Their father had become an old man . It was only at certain sentimental hours now that they could write to him with open hearts in the same way that they had been accustomed to run to himto dry their tears in the hairs of his beard . This was what they recounted with their pure faces and their continuous letter-writing , and with their conversation about other things . If the eldest girl would look out of the window and say , " Aber father would certainly never have played chess after lunch on a day like this ; he would have liked sitting in the casino gardens , especially now that they 've changed the flowers again , " this was a sign for the three of them to sit in silence after the first words of understanding had been spoken . " Father . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would turn her handkerchief in her fingers . It was easy to see from what they said that they all loved their father very much . When the Englishman stepped into the dining room one day at noon , surely the first thoughts of the three German girls must have turned to Professor Albatross . Here was a man about whom their father would have nodded to them in a concert hall if he had walked into it . Such a handsome man must surely have caught father 's attention , and he would have looked from one to the other of them , beating his head and smiling as if to the sound of music . When first he set foot in the room something sprang to life in every corner of it . The sight of this strange young man standing there made the three cradles of the German girls ' voices upset . Not even an " ach " nor an " aber " to meet the occasion . " An Englishman , " they exchanged among them . The fresh , the sturdy , the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I say . . . " remarked the young Englishman . He had looked carefully at every little piece of the room . " I wanted a table , " he said . And the old lady gave him one in a minute or two . But while he was waiting everyone had a chance to see it : the way his hair grew up and how his elegant head turned on his neck . He held his chin high , and his eyes were as blindly blue as if they had been extinguished with a red-hot iron . All the sun of the coast had seemingly descended upon his cranium and was dripping down over his brows . Little rays of it marched across the backs of his hands . Maybe this beauty is the toughest ; it is now the purest left in the world , thought the eldest girl . For an Italian must wear a color about his neck or a ring in his ear , but this British beauty depends on nothing at all but fogs that would throttle you if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The Englishman sat down at the little table they had given him and began to crunch radishes like almonds beneath his teeth . He looked steadily out of the window into the porcelain eyes of the cats and the stony doves which ornamented the garden . It seemed as if he could not bring himself to look into the eyes of the human faces that were in the room with him . The three girls had a glance for every mouthful that passed his lips . When the fresh figs were set before him he ate them in the English way , rippling the skin back until the fig in his hands bloomed open like a flower . There seemed to be nothing in any part of him that had survived a spectacle of pain . Surely , thought the eldest girl , he had never been beset , and if ever he had been sore in his heart for love or food , he had put that carefully aside . Everything on his plate he took for granted , even the salt in its shaker was the customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was thinking , nor had he any idea that people sometimes had Tess or did without . Everything that had ever happened to them , she would keep to herself . In her bones it would reside , and he would not know that for years they had been like mice lean for a crumb . Not a drop of his blood would ever sound the poverty of the years that ran behind them . They were in a new country of greed and plenty and they would forget , by turning their faces away , they would forget everything that had made their hearts like winter apples . " Lieblinge , " said the eldest girl to her sisters , " we must do our nails and behave like princesses . " They had to drop their lids to cover the jubilation in their eyes . This was the reward they owed Professor Albatross . What a recompense to the old man if his three daughters could between them bear back to him this evidence of health and prosperity , this assurance that all was well . Whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave the Englishman his temper of wealth and empire , they did not know . But his it was , and merely the sight of it would surely be enough to revive the old man 's courage . When the Englishman had finished eating he dabbed at his mouth with his napkin and then placed it in a little heap by the side of his plate . He had not tied it into a bowknot , as others had done , or made it into a butterfly . He had eaten well , but with such despatch . He walked out of the dining moue with his own standard set relentlessly upon him . He would recognize nothing short of health and austerity . Whatever he stood for had a name , and he would accept nothing less . He walked directly out into the back garden after lunch , and from their window the three German girls could see him . They stood in their bedroom , behind the folds of the curtains , and relished the rosy backs of his ears and his narrow wrists crossed behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in a wicker chair , and they started back from the window in fright . But his clear gaze and his short straight nose were pointing off towards Monte Carlo . Surely he did not even know the three girls were there . A strange sort of defiance for one another was in their eyes , and the eldest knew that it was she herself who must say what was to be said . She turned from the window and picked up her embroidery hoop and its veil of work from the table . The prosperity of this cloth with a fresh skein of white silk to it was equally as far from anything they had ever known . They had never before had time for embroidery until they had come to this affluent land . Beyond the window they could see the Englishman with an ivory part running through his hair . He was reading the London Times in the sun , with his legs stretched out before him and his ankles in gray socks crossed like a silver chain . Suddenly the eldest girl ran to her sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of their shoulders . " He looks so well ! " she whispered , and the wind of her breath in their necks made them shriek softly with laughter . " As if he had never been hungry ! " She was laughing , too , but her eyes were crying . She stood before them , laughing , with her small hands covering her face . He must have seen so many beautiful clothes , she was thinking . There was nothing she could wear that would catch his attention at all . She stood in the room with her two sisters , thinking of how she would speak to him . Not at dinner , for there would be too many people at the tables , but when he would perhaps walk out into the garden after having eaten , and she would throw a little scarf over her shoulders and follow him . In her mind she could hear the sound of her own tentative " bitte , bitte " following in his wake . But however she thought of him she could not forget the forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would make up some kind of a fine story about their lives , which had remained at home while surely he was traveling everywhere . " Your countrymen and you , you are forever traveling for beauty " was one of the things that she would say . She would talk of her father  --  Baron Albatross ; jah , why not a baron ? ? and of the idleness and poetry that had nourished them . With all of Germany suffering in one way or another , she would say to him , it was strange but true that they had never known any suffering at all . It was her father 's high position that had protected them . She would say it so many times , over and over , that she would make it true . " Do you ever come to Munich ? " she would ask him . By the time he came to Munich , she was thinking , by that time he would be in love . By that time his heart would be winged like an archangel , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if there were a moment of silence in the garden after dinner , or a pause of any kind between all the things they had to say , she would go on , " My two little sisters are with me . . . . " Suddenly she kissed their faces . " Oh , do n't even mention us to him ! " they whispered . " He is to be for you . He is to be your lover . We want him to be yours . " She was thinking that she must carry herself like a rich lady , and that any plaintiveness at all must be kept out of her voice . No prithee , do , please , pray . No insomuch as , but " Indeed , you must visit our prosperous city . . . " " If only I could wear four pairs of earrings at once , " she was thinking . She looked at her wan face in the glass . " I must smile , " she said . She crossed the room to the window to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper had dropped from his fingers and he was there , reflecting , dreaming , and pondering , deeply meditating . She wondered what dreams were in his head . And then suddenly the Englishman turned and looked up into her face . If a blush had sought to shame him for his impertinence , it perished in the relentless pride of his race . He lifted one hand to shade his eyes , and then he got to his feet . The German girl was clinging , half-swooning , to the window-frame . The Englishman cleared his throat . " You 're not by any chance . . . " he said , talking up from the garden , " I mean to say , I saw your names on the register a while ago . . . I dare say yours . Are you by any chance daughters of Professor Albatross of Munich ? I must have studied with your fatherphysics  --  at least , if he is . " " Yes , " said the German girl . Her voice could scarcely be heard . Her fingernails had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Her face was so contorted that her sisters scarcely knew her . " Professor Albatross , " she whispered out of the window . " Yes . " The two sisters saw her face hanging in anguish at the window . They themselves were too stricken to summon a word of response . She was standing with her mouth hanging open . She could not make another sound . " Fancy running into you here , " said the Englishman . Behind her hung the deathly silence ? grosse Seelen dulden still  --  with now and again the whisper of her sisters ' breathing like the flight of a mouse across the room . The Englishman was standing with one hand in his pocket , and the other lifted to shade his eyes . " Fancy , " he said . With this he gave a little nod of his head . " I just stopped off for lunch here , " he said . He smiled up at the German girl in the window , and with this he walked into the house , leaving the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in some kind of fury that had never possessed them before . Their eyes were warm , and their teeth were strung like pearls across their faces . They had so much to say to one another that they did n't know where to begin .
