It is nothing new for artists to fake antiques . Nor is it new for confidence men to take in wealthy suckers by posing as artists . But in France and in Lexington , Ky. last week two extraordinarily clever fakers provided two new twists to an old gag . <P> Back in April 1937 , a peasant named Jean Gonon was doing his spring plowing on a farm not far from Lyon , when he uncovered a figure of Venus . Features and limbs were damaged , but otherwise the figure , a gentle drape about its hips , was in beautiful shape . Officials examined it , pronounced it authentic Greek , and Farmer Gonon made money exhibiting it . <P> Last month there popped up at St. Etienne a dour , baldish , 31-year-old Italian sculptor named Francesco Cremonese , who swore that the Venus was his . He completed it , he said , in 1936 , buried it because nobody paid attention to his work , hoping to make a name for himself when it was dug up . <P> Experts belittled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Italy at the time he claimed . Cremonese said he could show pieces of the eye he had chipped off . But Farmer Gonon would not let him try to fit the missing pieces to his Venus . Cremonese said he would produce the model , then had trouble remembering her name ; it was Anna Something . Anna Strudinka , Polish waitress in a night club , turned up , announced she had been the model , permitted her neck to be measured ( it coincided with the neck of the figure ) but refused to let the investigation go any further . <P> At this point a jury of National Education Ministry officials stepped in , investigated , announced last week that yes , it was Cremonese 's statue . <P> The case in Lexington , Ky. was a good deal more complicated . There , four years ago , appeared a sculptor in his middle 30s who said that his name was Augustus Donfred H. Build . He was the son of a New York physician , said he , had studied in Florence for seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executing a commission in Tennessee . <P> Among the horse-and-dog lovers of Fayette County , Build flourished . For his heroic statue of Guy Axworthy , famed trotting stallion , he was reported to have received $15,000 . He made a bust of a dead superintendent of schools , of the founder of the Lexington Leader , statues of several champion great Danes , of a trotting mare and sulky . Then he disappeared . <P> Last week , in Fayette Circuit Court , witnesses told why . They knew Build , they testified , as J. D. Amason , operator of a bankrupt poultry farm at Flintville , Tenn . But beyond that they unfolded a stranger story : Build-Amason had served four prison terms , including one at Atlanta ( where he learned his art ) , and had once shot his way out of a hanging case in Texas . <P> Not his statues but his poultry farm got him in trouble . When it went bankrupt he tried to flee Tennessee , taking his automobile ( on which he had three mortgages ) and a truckload of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor abandoned his car , ran across country , got away , leaving a lawsuit between the three finance companies and his statues of horses and dogs , to mark his strange passage through the bluegrass country .
