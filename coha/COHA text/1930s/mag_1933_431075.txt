 | WHAT a mess we 've been in ! Every possibledisasterhas befallen our economic household ! The water pipes are clogged and frozen . The plaster in the living-room ceiling has fallen , smashing pictures and lamps , ruining the carpet . At one time even the foundations seemed shaky . Naturally , when so much that 's bad happens at once , there 's one thing for any woman to do : sit down and have a good cry . After that , of course , she has to do something constructive . But what ? We 've been in tears since the crash of 1929 . There must be at last an end of weeping , a moment when we finally powder our noses and face the problem squarely . Can we do anything ? Is there hope ? That 's the question I asked Dr. Raymond Moley . " Shall we call in a contractor , one of those fellows who talks about economic planning , makes surveys , and estimates on the entire job ? Or shall we just give up , destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I went to Dr. Moley for advice because he is going to be one of the most important factors in our national housekeeping during the next four years . Dr. Holey is President Roosevelt 's assistant in matters relating to governmental policy . In formulating a program for us he speaks for himself , not for Mr. Roosevelt . Still , as one of the President 's closest advisers , he is in a position to know whether or not anything can be done . Even before he answered , I felt better . To meet Dr. Moley is to know he will never become hysterical with confusion , or waste time talking with a dreamer 's zeal . He will never blue-print a plan while the pipes burst , Johnny gets the flu , and the cook leaves . Dr. Holey is a political scientist , not , as he has often been labeled , an economist . Political science is the study of the state in its classical sense : its action and relation to the people composing the state . No pompous academician is this Moley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office he occupies as Assistant Secretary of State . When your eyes penetrate the mist of cigarette smoke in which he invariably veils himself , you see a youngish man of medium height , broad-shouldered , with fat cheeks but no jowls . Dr. Moley on a casual work-day morning is dressed all in blue , with a nice regard for crisp blue tie and shirt and a professorial abandon as to the crease in his trousers or the ashes on his lapel . Remembering that he was a Columbia professor before he entered the President 's official family , he may at first seem the complete pedagogue , with his low voice , wide forehead , black brows , and thinning gray hair . Then suddenly his dark eyes will  | slant and twinkle as he chuckles like a small boy bringing a mouse into the schoolroom . You may not agree with Dr. Moley , but you can not keep from liking him . The pride with which he produces from his pockets spelling papers and drawings from the hands of his eight-year-old identical twins is as engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wrote a book on Shakespeare when I was twenty-two . It 's pretty good , too , " he will tell you . " But nobody will publish it . " Yet on his significant principles he is impersonal , grave . Take up any often repeated question , such as war debts or tariffs . Then he thinks , hard . You can almost see him think . It is a long time before he answers . Like his friend , Franklin Roosevelt , he laughs easily , appreciatively , at other people 's jokes and his own . Like the President , too , he has a sincere interest in and liking for people . His assistants boss him , else he would never refuse any one an appointment . Chairs for callers beside his desk are black leather , worn , comfortable . His friends drift in and out of his office freely and friendlily . They filch his cigarettes and his time ; they are informal but never familiar . Nevertheless he is unexpectedly sharp and accurate in his estimate of men and women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students of politics . Hence Emerson , Mark Twain , and Dreiser were required reading in the university courses he gave in government . Dr. Moley takes no exercise if he can avoid it . Relaxation ? He says : - " I do n't have any . This thing is everything there is to me . So why do anything that 's a great bore , like golf ? I know of no scientific proof that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . ' " Moley is not dull . Yet he has worked every vacation and holiday of his nine years at Columbia , been at his office every Sunday save for the hours spent at church . Born in Berea , Ohio , 46 years ago , Raymond Moley was educated for the most part in that state , taught as assistant professor of politics at Western Reserve University , in Cleveland , and then directed the Cleveland Foundation before going to Columbia . The close association between PresidentRoosevelt and-Dr . Moley has been rather brief . Dr. Moley became Director of Research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , and did not meet Mr. Roosevelt until the latter 's 1928 gubernatorial campaign , when he gave the candidate some suggestions . Later , when as governor Mr. Roosevelt formed his commission on the administration of justice in New York State ? one of his principal innovations ? he appointed Dr. Moley his representative , giving him charge of the active research . In this work their mutual admiration and cooperation grew . Has Dr. Moley a cure-all for us in this predicament ? No , indeed ! Raymond Moley is a realist ; he has no time for theoretical formulas . Ours is a perfectly good house , he maintains . His idea is to go immediately about the work of repairs . Says he : " Let 's jack up the foundation . Let 's call a plumber to mend the furnace at once . Have him thaw out the pipes and find out why they 're clogged . Order a plasterer to attend to the living-room ceiling . Let 's tackle each of these conditions promptly and separately . While the workmen are on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to make the house more livable than ever before . @# @# @#  | " completely planned society in a country like the United States is a difficult , perhaps unattainable achievement , " he explained . " We have been going through the greatest depression in our history . Emergency measures have been and are necessary ; but , in taking each step to meet conditions , the larger movements of society must be considered , and together with that , the larger purposes of governmental policy . " Many economists have spoken of economic planning , and the suggestions they make , while individually they may differ among themselves , are helpful toward a much more intelligent looking into the future by government and by business itself than has prevailed heretofore . Specific and general plans for all industry , however , to be enforced by governmental authority , are deserving of serious thought before they are to be enthusiastically adopted . " On the very day the new administration came into office , the foundations of our home ? the banking system were rocking . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of the methods Dr. Moley believes will set our house in order . " Immediately the President was inaugurated , he was face to face with his first opportunity to show what he meant by the New Deal , " Dr. Holey stated . " As he expressed it , We have had a bad banking situation . Although the majority of bankers have been honest and reliable , enough of them were either incompetent or dishonest in handling the people 's funds to shock the people into a sense of insecurity . ' The immediate necessity , therefore , was to restore their faith in banks ; to relieve them from the insidious effects of fear . " His first step toward accomplishing this was to show in his inaugural address that he recognized the danger and to follow up that recognition by a promise to bring the banks under the control of the Government . His second step was to secure the passage of the Emergency Act to protect depositors and to enable sound banks to continue . Thus it was shown that the New Deal meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that justified the Government in putting a firm hand on the banking system of the country when it failed properly to serve the people 's needs . " The first card of the New Deal , then , was to save the banking system of the country , without which our present industrial structure could not stand . The New Deal , as defined here by Dr. Moley , leads the Government of the United States in a new direction . It is not toward socialism , communism , or fascism . It exemplifies the principle that the people 's necessity is the true business of the Government ; that when the public services do not serve the consumer , the Government , as the trustee of the public , takes control . THIS is an entirely new interpretation of the business of government . Time out of mind it has been the duty of the state to protect its citizens from outside danger , both from foreign foes and from natural disturbances . It has maintained armies and built dams . Now for the first time in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people from disaster as well . Saving the banks was a Herculean task . The portion of the banking bill which guarantees that only sound banks shall operate is of incalculable importance . The bank is the funnel through which the fuel for industry is poured . You put your money in the bank . But it does not stay there . The bank takes your money and invests it in your country 's bonds , in mortgages on , for instance , factories ; it loans your money to finance the farmers ' crops and the merchants ' stocks . In other words , you pour your money into the wide end of the funnel ; it flows through the tube to lubricate the wheels of industry and agriculture . When the tube is clogged , both you and the economic organism suffer . " The banking system of this country has passed through a dreadful ordeal , " Dr. Moley said , " and every effort should be made to see that it does not happen again . " " The necessity for raising of farm prices goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Moley explained . " Remedial efforts are directed to this end . The so-called Domestic Allotment Plan embodied in a bill lost in the last Congress was intended to meet the problem . Something similar to this method is the administration 's plan . " As Dr. Moley points out , the farm problem is a matter of surplus . Increased acreage , first stimulated by the war , plus increased production per acre due to improved agricultural methods , are in large part responsible for the increase in farm produce . Due to the basic law of supply and demand , the price of a commodity rises when its quantity decreases , as we all know . Therefore our job is to limit agricultural production to the needs of the market . In other words , the farmers of the country are like women who make too much " pinmoney " jelly . The solution for this uneconomic condition is for you and your neighbors to agree , through some central agency ? the Ladies Exchange to you ; Uncle Sam to the farmers ? to jar less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a profit on your summer 's work . This , in essence , is this country 's agricultural problem . DR . MOLEY contends that our first duty , in putting our national house in order , is to get the head of the household financially on his feet . The family provider is obviously agriculture . Nothing else is so important . We can do without chintz for the windows and even without shoes if we must . But we can not live without bread . " The most important problem before the American people is to raise the purchasing power of the farmer , " said Dr. Moley emphatically . " This should be accomplished by making it possible for the farmer to get higher prices for his products , by relieving him of the burden of debt by some equitable means , and by reducing his taxes . " Obviously the agricultural industry , being not only a business , but a way of life and an essential part of civilization , deserves special help in its present condition . Mr. Roosevelt has described the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pointed out the increasing burden of the farmer . Agriculture will have to be provided with reasonable governmental guidance and assistance . " The farmer 's position , at the present , is just this : his taxes have gone up and stayed up . The price he pays for coal and gasoline and clothing have come down . But the price of wheat and cotton , the products the farmer grows and sells , have gone ' way down , too . In order to go on working and growing our food , in order to pay the plumber and the plasterer , and to buy a new dress for mother and sweaters for Janie and Johnny , and in order to pay his high taxes , the farmer must pay less for his running expenses and get better prices for the commodities he sells . Now then , let 's take a look at the furnace , our industries . There 's something wrong with the way ' the drafts work . We opened them ; what happened ? Over-production , over-expansion , and unemployment . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire went out , and we had more unemployment . It has been too discouraging . Maybe we 'd better get a new furnace . What is Dr. Moley 's advice ? Nonsense , says he ( in effect ) . Have the old furnace fixed up with a few modern gadgets ; learn how to stoke it better , manipulate the drafts more intelligently , and it will do splendidly for a long , long time . One thing is ,  | certain : we need a new gauge , so that we can see when it is generating too much steam , when our industries are in danger of over-expansion . Ill-advised and speculative investment are responsible for a great deal of that overexpansion . Right now Janie is having a charming time with the results of our get-richquick ; fervor . There she sits , in one of the few quiet corners , blissfully cutting battalions of paper dolls from crisp green-and-gold documents . Those lovely stocks ! Those handsome bonds ! Ah me ! If we had n't been so absorbed in them ourselves , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government do something to prevent us from running wild again ? Not by law , says Dr. Moley . " The creation of new financial and industrial enterprises is a matter which , under our present system , must be left largely , if not wholly , to private initiative ; but the Government can go a long way toward preventing unwise industrial expansion by the publication of correct and properly interpreted information . " The Government is like a waiter serving a fat woman in a restaurant . He ca n't say : " Madame , you shall not have this succulent pork roast and a chocolate parfait . They 're chock full of calories . I 'll bring you a nice lean lamb chop , and a lettuce and cucumber salad instead . " He can , however , give her a menu that states the number of calories in the parfait and in the salad , and trust to her common sense and self-control . After all , she does n't want to pop the seams in her new spring suit ! The Federal Government can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated by a company to finance a new shoe factory . It can publish facts about the shoe industry . It can report the number of shoe factories already established ; whether they have plenty of business or not enough . If shoe factories at a given moment are working only part time , then shares in a new one are not promising . Investor self-control can do much to check unsound investments and , through this method , overexpansion of industry . It will serve as a gauge on the furnace . ( M moreover , if the Government gave us this information , we should not have to depend solely upon the advice of supersalesmen from brokerage and underwriting houses . ) Over-expansion is only one cause of unemployment and consequent depression . When the depression lifts , shall we have an army of four or five million unemployed who can not be re-absorbed into industry because of depression-produced efficiency and because of the increasing number of new machines invented to supplant human labor ? that condition called technological unemployment ? DR . MOLEY is not pessimistic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to say how many will remain permanently unemployed because of the increase in technical efficiency , for there may be a shift in the population from one section to another and from city to country . Those , however , who are left unemployed in cities will constitute a problem to be met by various devices . Temporary relief must be provided . Shorter hours will help . Unemployment insurance will help . " Dr. Moley notes that , during the era of " prosperity , " between five and six million migrated from the farm to the city . Since 1930 , however , men and women have returned to the land in large numbers . Of course , Brother Bill and Cousin Sally have not succumbed to the irresistible lure of the soil . In many cases they are out of work . They have returned to their rural families because on the farm there is at least something to eat . Dr. Moley assumes this shift may continue . It may result in the decentralization of industry . Little factories may spring up in small towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make screws . Another at Jones Point may make piston rings . The parts may be assembled in a tractor plant in Detroit . Thus a man may be a part-time farmer and part-time factory worker , may have his bit of ground , his house , and his cow . Then , even if he gets paid for only six hours a week at the mill , his family will always have shelter and food . For the balance of workers in the cities , Dr. Moley is suffering no overwhelming fear . The Frankenstein of the Machine Age does not have him completely cowed . The advent of steam and electricity held a threat of technological unemployment . Yet in the past , new machinery , together with shorter hours , absorbed more labor . In ' did the working week was shortened in New York State to 54 hours . Today we probably need even a shorter week . Other devices to divert working men and women from tending a machine into other useful tasks will evolve . Some years ago we raised the age for compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors between the ages of fourteen and seventeen are at work today . They could stay in school . Even a compulsory college education could n't hurt them . EDUCATION for leisure is an idea as yet scarcely touched . Scientific research , playgrounds , health development , travel ? all offer fields for extensive non-mechanical activity . With more education , greater grows the demand for books and magazines , for instance . Mechanical developments thus far have failed to invent an engine that can write a good biography . No illustrated travelogue is a substitute for a personal view of the Grand Canyon . New services will undoubtedly develop . Look at the progress already ! Luxuries available only to the rich in the past are in common use even in these depressed times . We send sheets and bath towels and our husbands ' shirts to the laundry . We have our hair washed and waved at the beauty shop . An increasing number of us think a manicure and a facial as important as a clean dress for a party . We dine sometimes in restaurants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Need-we worry that people will cease to want intellectual , spiritual , or material things , in greater quantity and diversity than they have at present ? Their wants are all fuel for the furnace . As soon as the plumber finishes with the furnace , Dr. Moley wants to put him to work on the hot-water pipes . The tariff has frozen some of them , dangerously impairing the circulation of our trade . Says he : " Obviously our tariff policy of raising tariffs to prohibitive levels has been ruinous . The wayout , however , in my opinion , is through individual agreements with specific countries . The world has built itself into such a state of tariff warfare that present conditions can not be terminated on one side of the ocean without like action elsewhere . We can not disarm the world in an economic sense any more than we can in a military sense ? by doing the disarming ourselves , first . It must be done by agreement . The idea of reciprocal tariffs is not new . It has been tried throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , notably McKinley , as a means of bringing the world to a peaceful trade condition . " The tariff , a tax on imports employed early in our history as a revenue measure , like today 's gasoline tax , came to be used to protect young America 's growing industries . Like poplar roots around a water-main , our tariff has almost stopped our valuable foreign trade . Now the only currencies used in trade between nations are gold ; services , such as insurance or shipping ; or goods , such as canned beans and coffee pots . We have our own services ; there is n't enough gold to use for everything , and its transfer is troublesome and expensive . So we pay for French lingerie with @#  | American coffee pots . Foreign trade is almost all " swapping . " The more we swap , the more we can produce to swap ! The present tariff shields our industry until it is smothering . Umbrella ribs , fire-crackers , stained-glass windows , not to mention essentials like soap and silk , are guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Therefore foreign countries have no credit with us . And therefore we can not sell them anything . There is , to be sure , a free list : fourteen pages of fine print , giving us the privilege of importing cuttlefish bones and impure tea ; leeches , moss and seaweed ; whole elephant tusks and real teeth . But from anahydrides to zaffer , there is n't one thing to put under a Christmas tree ! Tariff-freezing has not been the only trouble with the pipes in our house . Foreign government debts have troubled us , too . " The Roosevelt formula with respect to these debts gives debtors constant access to the creditor , " says Dr. Moley . In other words , regard the debt as the problem of a bill at the grocer 's . The grocer does n't call a conference of the housewives on his books . If one of them ca n't pay , or ca n't pay her bill in full , or feels she 's been overcharged , she can go to the store , talk it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of mutual justice and satisfaction . What about the living-room ceiling ? For years we failed to notice that the plaster was cracking and becoming insecure . That ceiling is the cost of government . In our disastrous hour it has fallen on our heads . " THE cost of government ? national , state , and local ? has mounted by leaps and bounds in the past few years , " commented Dr. Moley . " It is true that this increase has been due in part to additional sums being spent on welfare activities . But it is altogether incorrect to say that this increase is entirely or even in large part to be attributed to the Government 's increased interest in social welfare . Vast roadbuilding programs , public works of all sorts , and great increase in the manning of our bureaucracies every year have been important . This does not mean , however , that welfare activities should not be subjected to keen scrutiny as to the efficiency of their administration , just as are other agencies . Welfare workers should not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to a rigid accountability for results in the activities which they are conducting . Intelligent welfare activities are indispensable to society , but they must become increasingly intelligent . " By far the greatest item in the Federal Government 's expense account is war . Of our fourbillion-dollar budget i z percent has gone to pay the cost of past and future wars : for defense , internal war debt , and over a billion for veterans . In other words , we 've been paying for the medicines we used during our last attacks of grippe and influenza , and spending well over half a billion annually for aspirin , quinine , and hot-water bottles to cure the next illness . We 'd like to economize by the disarmament method . But we ca n't empty our medicine cabinet when there are a lot of germs floating around and we would be the only nation without remedies . Many advocate using the debts as a big stick to secure general reduction of armaments . They suggest we say to France and England , for instance : " Reduce your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your debts . That way we 'll each save our taxpayers money and minimize the danger of war , besides . " Dr. Moley does not agree . As we have seen , he would treat the debts as individual problems . " The question of linking the debts with disarmament is one which must be approached with an open mind , " he asserts . " This is a position that permits the problem of disarmament to be approached on the basis of a fair process of reduction of armaments by all countries without special favors being granted to any one of then . The economic safety of the world requires the serious prosecution of all efforts in the direction of disarmament : but obviously it is a slow process , and negotiations relating to it will probably ultimately be more or less of a continuing business of negotiation rather than the settlement of the whole problem at once . " So much for the cost of government ! It is a comfort to know that the plasterer will soon be at work repairing the ceiling if the Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promise to make a 25 percent cut in governmental costs . I asked Dr. Moley if we are on our way out of this depression . " People connected with the Government have been criticized often , and rightly , for business predictions , " he said . " This is a wholesome sign . I think the proper answer is to say that I , for one , am not making any comments whatsoever about the future of business . " In intensity and complexity , his depression exceeds anything in this generation . We can not go back into history for aid and direction , either in knowing how to meet it or in appraising its seriousness . All we can do is meet its clear necessities and try to build our economic life so that we can restore more happy conditions . " By an attack on our problems of taxation and expenditure , and by a specific movement to assist agriculture , we can go a long way toward moving out of the present depression . We shall , of course , in the meantime need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time as this the advocates of inflation will be active and will be widely supported . We all ought to consider , however , that inflation is a word that has such a variety of meanings that it is dangerous to generalize about it . " The advance planning of public works is a principle that should be considered in connection with the depression ; but what we have needed in the past is not only adherence to the idea of planning public works but provisions made in time of prosperity in the direction of providing immediate relief through these measures . " By this advance planning of public works , Dr. Moley means that we should not build a new wing on the house or do over Janie 's room when every one is busy and prosperous . Instead , let 's appropriate the funds for it in our annual housekeeping budget , and lay the money aside . When times are dull , then let 's go ahead . This will aid the workmen who do the jobs ; they in turn patronize father 's business . Intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a trade stimulus . THAT 'S an idea for the future . In the future , too , would n't it be kinder for Uncle Sam to take us into his confidence about the condition of the house ? He knew the furnace was breaking down . Why let us spend our money for evening wraps and our time- dancing when we might be preparing for hard times ahead ? Opines Dr. holey : - " The constitutional duty of the President requires that he acquaint Congress with the condition of the country from time to time . No doubt the best policy is to be quite free and frank with the people . In the long run such a policy is most advantageous to every one . " Our house needs such a lot of repair . Is it worth it ? It has proved so faulty . But wait ! Has it ?  - -  Is n't the trouble with ourselves ? We 've treated our economic domicile so carelessly . We could , of course , tear it down and hazard a new house we know nothing about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . managed by this same old human race , stand , if we do n't treat it intelligently ? " The - people of the United States have @#  | answered this question by changing the leadership of the Government , not only in the Federal Government but in many of the states , and in giving to this new government a definite mandate to set about the business of reconstruction , ? replied Dr. Moley . " Our party system is so fundamentally believed in by the people of this country that movements such as have caused violent changes in foreign countries can gain little support . The people of this country have spoken emphatically for a change in leadership and they have spoken also for the conservative method of planning and building on what we have . It is a tribute to the good sense of the American people that they have adopted this more sure and slow-moving but essentially wholesome method of change . " I am an academic man , but I do not believe in a dependence at this time upon historical analogies or theoretical solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intelligent , calm , and ordered means of restoration . Historical analogies and theoretical choices in argument are always dangerous , particularly in the hands of people who know only a little history . When you know enough history , you know that historical analyses do not solve future problems . " I am not a revolutionist . I believe in ordered progress . "
