txt J. Ramsay , Prime Minister of Great Britain , may or may not be thrown out of office by the defeat of his Labor government in the House of Commons within forty-eight hours from now , but tonight he had a great victory when the leaders of both Opposition parties in Parliament accepted With praise the results , of his Indian conference . After the debate had closed it was learned here that Mahatma Gandhi , Indian Nationalist leader , who was released from prison today , had reached Bombay to discuss the parley 's results with his associates . Stanley Baldwin , . leader of the Conservatives , specifically pledged himself that if he returned to power his new government would implement the round table proposals by carrying them on to completion in an act of Parliament giving India the desired Constitution . . - Even Sir John Simon of the , Libefia party , who Is expected tomorrow or the next day to make the speech of his life on the trade disputes act , which may . cause the government 's downfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations . He declared that a great beginning had been made in the right direction . His chief implied criticism was that the things which were still left undone were not mere details for settlement by the drafters of the Constitution , but great major problems that still offered grave difficulties which must be solved before the Indian question is finally settled . Good Chance for Government . But there was no trace of hostility in Sir John 's comments . That is all being held in reserve for the debate on the second reading of the trade disputes act , which will be resumed tomorrow and ends with voting on the question on Wednesday night . The probability now is that the government will win by a small majority , but even so , Mr. will face still graver danger of defeat when the time comes to amend the trade bill in its final parliamentary stages . But this is Mr. 's own day . India has given his government as much prestige as it derived from the naval conference or from the achievements of Philip Snowden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in first year of the Labor Administration . Incidentally , the victory for Mr. was a downfall for Winiton Churchill , who . attacked the Government and its Indian conference with jibes and sneers , and was promptly repudiated for so doing by Stanley Baldwin , leader of his own party , and all the other Conservative members who participated in the debate . Up to the last moment Mr. Baldwin and the other leaders begged Mr. Churchill to keep quiet and say nothing about India , but he insisted on having his own way on the ground that he was the only man in the House of Commons who had the courage to say that the British Empire was going to ruin because of the weakness of Lord Irwin , Viceroy of India , and the Government at home . Churchill Speech . Ignored . Mr. Baldwin 's anxiety in the matter was not because he feared Mr. Churchill would commit Oe Conservative party , but because lae dreaded the effect his expected tirade would have on the Indians themselves at the very moment of Mahatma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made by the conference in restoring the good feeling of the two countries . ? But Mr. Baldwin 's fears in that respect were groundless . Even the Indian delegates who had not yet returned home and who crowded the House galleries to listen to the de- bate joined in laughter at Mr. Churchill 's statements . He called the round table conference " an unauthorized would-be consituent assembly which had indulged in an avalanche of hysteric talk . " He said its result had been " a double concurrent convulsion in both countries . " Referring to the empire in charge of the Government as the ship of State , he said : " It is already a wreck , with all its compartments of employment , industry and foreign relations collapsed , with its captain , officers and crew dancing in the saloon to the music of a jazz band . " Baldwin Repudiates Churchill . Mr. Churchill did say that he spoke only for himself , and was not voicing the opinion of his colleagues in the Conservative party . But Mr. Baldwin made that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Churchill did not represent the party at.all in what he had said . He admitted Mr. Churchill had some popular support , but added : " There must be continuity of policy and unanimity among the British parties if the tie between us and India is not to snap . If the Conservatives return to power , it will be our duty to implement the work of the conference . We must all strive for the federation of India without denying the existence of difficulties . For my part ; I intend to do all in my power to see that the subject of proper safeguards and pledges of the successive governments to offer India a partnership in the British Empire shall be redeemed . " If the Conservatives do return to power , Mr. Churchill , who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the last Baldwin Administration , will not be in the new Cabinet . Premier Opens Debate . Premier , who had opened the debate , briefly reviewed the work of the conference without adding anything new in the way of information . He concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational tone of voice across the table between the front benches of the government and the opposition , and was directed straight at Winston Churchill . His plea was that Parliament let the government go on to finish the work begun at the round table . " If you refuse , and we can not do this , what will be the results ? " he asked . " Repression , nothing but repression . It will be a very curious repression , a very uncomfortable repression , and a repression in which we will get neither credit nor success . It will be the repression of a whole mass of people , a great proportion of them being women and children . It will be the repression not of an individual or of organizations but of a whole people . " If we are prepared to march our troops from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. then refuse to allow us to go on with this plan ; if we are prepared to subdue by force not only the people , but the spirit of the times , then refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate . for the whole world to behold , the failure our political genius and thus bring our name and fame very low indeed , then refuse to let us proceed . " If , on the other hand , you wish to bind India to you by bonds of confidence and make her happy within your Empire ; if you wish to hear her praise you in gratitude and remain with you in pride , then accept the work that has been done by the conference and instruct the government to proceed with it to a complete conclusion . " Wedgwood Beim Concludes . Wedgwood Benn , Secretary of State for India , closed the debate for the government . He said that there had been such unanimity of all parties it was not necessary for him or anybody else to reply to Mr. Churchill except to call attention to the fact that the policy advocated by the repudiated Conservative member would mean ruling India by machine guns . Mr. Benn added that one of the most valuable by-products of the round table had been the effect that the reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He referred to a New York dispatch to The London Times stating that American opinion of England with reference to India was better than it had been for many years .
