txt John F. Curry , leader of Tammany Hall , . declared yesterday at a public hearing before the Hofstadter legislative committee in the County Court House that he had telephoned Justice Henry L. Sherman of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court at Lake Placid as part of his political duty as leader of the Democratic party in New York City to help in a test of the powers of the committee . Professing to see no impropriety in the leader of the dominant local political organization getting in touch with a judge , Mr. Curry declared that he had no interest in Dr. William F. Doyle , to whom Justice Sherman granted a stay of execution of his thirty-day contempt sentence on the following day , beyond the fact that Doyle was a Democrat . He testified that he had asked Justice Sherman to return to New York to hear the application for a stay , but that Justice Sherman had replied that he could not return because of engagements but would be available at Lake Placid the following morning . Plea Sent to Governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of five to four , adopted a resolution requesting Governor Roosevelt to call a special session of the Legislature to pass a bill empowering the committee to grant immunity to witnesses , which the Court of Appeals in its decision in the Doyle case decided could not be done by resolution . In a letter to the Governor which was sent to Albany with a copy of the resolution Mr. Seabury urged the necessity of the special session and charged widespread corruption in the New York City Government . " This corruption could not exist on so large a scale , " he wrote , " if the sinister forces which are profiting by it were not afforded protection . " In the performance of its task the committee has been met with every obstruction which it has been possible for the beneficiaries of this vicious system to throw in the way . " Talley Sought Curry 's Aid . In explaining how he came to come to the aid of Dr. Doyle , whose counsel was seeking a stay of execution of the contempt sentence to keep him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by former Judge Alfred J. Talley , Doyle 's counsel , to locate an Appellate Division Judge who would receive an application . Mr. Curry said that he was glad to do a favor for Mr. Talley , but declared that his chief motive was to aid in a - test of the constitutionality of the committee 's power to grant immunity , which the Court of Appeals later held had not been conferred by the resolution which created it . " I , as the representative of the Democratic organization of the city of New York , was expecting some one to test the committee 's powers to grant immunity , " Mr. Curry said . " Therefore , when the request came for my aid I was glad to be of service . " " All you were interested in was to challenge the power of the commit : tee ? " asked Samuel Seabury , counsel of the committee . " Judge Seabury , in answering that I would say to you that we do n't believe this is a fair investigation , " Mr. Curry replied with considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it can be had , of the Demo ? cratic party of the city of New York . The Democratic members of this committee attempted to go through the State and have this a fair inves- tigation . They were voted down . It is. nothing but persecution of the dominant party of New York that this committee is doing at this time . " The partisan feeling which has been evident from the beginning of the committee 's investigation showed itself at the executive meeting preceding the hearing . It increased in intensity during the questioning of Dr. Doyle and reached a climax during the examination of Mr. Curry . At the beginning of the hearing , in the county court house , Mr. Seabury 's entrance brought such a burst of applause that Senator John J. , Democratic member of the committee , charged that a large part of the committee 's clerical force had abandoned the duties for which it was being paid and was taking part in the demonstration . Mr. Curry 's entrance into the court room during the examination of Dr. Doyle brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Seabury had made a point in questioning Dr. Doyle , and some of Mr. Seabury 's supporters joined in the handclapping started by sympathizers of Mr. Curry in the mistaken belief that the applause was for the committee 's counsel . The partisan spirit manifested by the committee 's members extended to many of the spectators in the crowded court room , and Senator Samuel H. Hofstadter , the chairman , frequently had to rap his gavel for order and threatened several times to have the attendants remove the demonstrators . The Democratic members of the committee , particularly Senator and Assemblyman Louis A. Cuvillier , interrupted Mr. Seabury frequently , apparently with a view to assisting Mr. Curry , who seemed well able to take care of himself . The minority repeatedly charged Mr. Seabury with unfairness in his questions , and Mr. Cuvillier at one point threatened to withdraw his colleagues . Curry Testifies Freely . Mr. Curry , well-groomed and selfpossessed , met most of Mr. Seabury 's questions freely . He was rather hazy as to whether or not he had heard that Dr. Doyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that to do so would tend to incriminate , but testified that he did not know that this was the case . Mr. Curry caused some surprise by his answer to Mr. Seabury 's question as to whether he did not think it a great piece of impertinence for him , simply because he was leader of Tammany Hall , to undertake to find for a lawyer in a litigation pending in the Supreme Court a judge before whom an application might be made . " May I answer you ? " Mr. Curry said . " That is the first time since I was leader of the organization that I have done such a thing . " " All right , I am glad to know that , " commented Mr. Seabury . " You are interested in Doyle ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " I am interested in any Democrat in the city of New York , " replied Mr. Curry . " I am not particularly interested in Dr. Doyle , any more than I would be in Brown , Jones , Smith or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Seabury continued . " Absolutely , " Mr. Curry replied . The first interruption by a Democratic member was when Senator insisted that Mr. Curry have opportunity to supplement his reply to a question as to whether he . believed he had been persecuted , after he had characterized the committee 's investigation as persecution of the Democratic party . " Let him finish his sentence , " said Senator . " Just a minute , " interjected Senator Hofstadter . " Let him finish it , " Senator again said . " Just a . minute , " Senator Hofstadter repeated . " Do n't shout me down just because you are chairman , " said Senator with every indication of anger . " I am conducting this meeting , " rejoined Senator Hofstadter . " The witness will be given an opportunity to complete his answer . What did you intend to say ? " Tells of Talley Call . " Well , now , when did you first decide to interest yourself in Dr. Doyle ? " Mr. Seabury asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , " Mr. Curry replied . " I wish you would answer my question , " Mr. Seabury continued . " We will come to that . You will have full opportunity to make any statements you want . " All right , " said Mr. Curry , " I will answer that question . " About 6:30 on the evening of Wednesday , I believe , July 23 , I received a telephone call ' from a reputable lawyer , a former judge , Alfred J. Talley , who said he would like to secure soea judge who would hear an application for a stay pending an appeal in the Doyle case . " Mr. Curry added that Mr. Talley had asked him to try to locate a judge , as he had been unable to locate one . " And did you get busy right away trying to find a judge ? " " Absolutely I did , Judge , " said Mr. Curry . Welcomed Court Test . Mr. Curry insisted that Mr. Talley did not tell him that Doyle had refused to answer on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Doyle was testing the power of the committee . " And we were glad to take advantage of that , " Mr. Curry added , " because we were waiting for somebody to test the constitutionality . " " As soon as you 1 eard that there was somebody somewhere that was going to test the power of the committee , your heart was enlisted ? " Mr. Seabury queried sarcastically . " Absolutely , " said Mr. Curry . " And not only your heart but your sword ; that , is right ? " Mr. Seabury continued . " If you can word it that way , Judge , it is all right , " Mr. Curry , replied . " Might I say , Judge , in answer to that , you know me a long while . You know that I have gone to you for favors in the old days . Is that correct ? " " And did you get them , Mr. Curry ? " asked Senator John J. Dunnigan , Democrat . " Yes , " said Mr. Curry . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May we have a statement ? " said Mr. Seabury . " I am-not conscious of it , but I am glad to be reminded of it . I ask for the occasion when I had the pleasure of doing you a favor and what the favor consisted of . " " The favor consisted of a jury notice , " said Mr. Curry with an approach to a grin . " You asked me to excuse a juror ? " said Mr. Seabury . " A juror , " confirmed Mr. Curry . " And I excused him ? " Mr. Seabury continued . " You complied with it and I was thankful for it , " said Mr. Curry . " Have you and I had any other relations that you can recall ? " " Not that I recall , " said Mr. Curry . Mr. Curry said he had not discussed calling a judge with any one but Mr. Talley , and had tried to get other judges of the Appellate Division before he called Justice Sherman . At this point in the examination , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me say here , if I may , to the committee that Jud.ge Sherman made a statement of the facts to me in which he pointed out that before the order was actually signed he had arranged with Presiding Justice Finch to call the court in session on the following Monday . " " We are very glad to receive that statement , " said Senator Hofstadter . Denies Seeking to Silence Doyle . Mr. Curry said he telephoned at once to Mr. Talley that Justice Sherman would be available at Lake Placid the following morning . He denied that he was anxious that Dr. Doyle should not speax and denied any knowledge that Doyle had split fees in cases , before the Board of Standards and Appeals . " I endeavored to secure the whereabouts of every member of the Appellate Division with the exception of Judge Merrill , " Mr. Curry said . " I found out that Judge O'Malley was in Rochester visiting his brother . I found out that Judge Finch was - in West Hampton . I found that Judge was at Chicora , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was unable to locate Judge Martin . So I spared no one in trying to ? " Objects to Word " Reach . " " You were ready to reach them all . if necessary ? " asked Mr. Seabury . " Not ' reach ' them , Judge , " objected Mr. Curry . " I would not put it that way . " " You endeavored to locate them because you wanted to see the power of the committee tested ? " Mr. Seabury continued . " Absolutely , " replied Mr. Curry . Mr. Seabury then asked what effect a stay would have in testing the committee 's powers . Mr. Curry parried this by saying that this was a legal question he was not qualified to answer . This precipitated a wrangle , with the Democratic committeemen insisting that the question was unfair . Senator Hofstadter asked Mr. Curry if he had anything more to say , and then asked if the Democratic members of the committee wished to ask any questions . " No , " said Mr. Cuvillier . " None whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing to it . " Tells of Friendship With Judges . Mr. Curry said that he had known all the judges of the Appellate Division and disclosed that he had served in the Assembly with Presiding Justice Finch , a Republican , in 1903 and 1904 . " My reason for calling these judges was personal friendships that existed all the way for from ten to thirty years of political activity , " Mr. Curry explained . Mr. Curry , in the face of repeated questions by Mr. Seabury , insisted that he believed it part of his function as leader of the Democratic organization to inject himself into this case on the ground that he and the organization were interested in a legal test of the powers of the committee . " If you thought the case was important and affected the interests of the organization of which you are the head , you would not hesitate to get a judge who would hear some application , " Mr. Seabury asked . " I would step on the gas wherever it would be of help to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great emphasis . Mr. Seabury 's final question , as to whether Mr. Curry did not believe that his interference in the Doyle case was an impropriety , raised a storm of protetkt from the Democratic members . Senator declared that the question was unfair , and it was then that Mr. Cuvillier threatened that the Democratic members would leave the hearing . " Do you not think that it was , to put it very mildly , an impropriety on your part to undertake , at the request of Doyle 's counsel , to try to get him a judge before whom he could make an application ? " was the final form in which Mr. Seabury phrased his last question . " I object , " shouted Mr. Cuvillier . " I do n't , " said Mr. Curry , replying to Mr. Seabury . " He has answered ' once before that same question , " said Mr. Cuvillier . " I am satisfied with that answer , " said Mr. Seabury.               @ @ @ @ @ @
