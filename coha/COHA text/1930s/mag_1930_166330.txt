Reporters with belted overcoats and large black cameras crowded the platform of Vienna 's smoky Westbahnhof to greet the most interesting man in Austria , eagle-beaked Monsignor Ignaze Seipel , onetime Prime Minister of Austria , leader of the Christian Socialist Party , crafty cleric , on his return from delivering a series of theological lectures at the University of the tiny independent Grand Duchy of Luxemburg . As the ex-Prime Minister alighted , the newshawks blurted quick questions . Was it true that he favored the return of the Habsburgs to reign in Austria ? Did he want to form a separate most Catholic Kingdom of united Austria and Bavaria ? Did he want to indemnify the Habsburgs for property confiscated by the Austrian Republic ? In Luxemburg had he visited ex-Empress Zita of Austria , as reported , and discussed with her these matters ? Deftly Mgr . Seipel avoided the more contentious questions . <P> " I did not see Her Majesty the Empress in Luxemburg , " said he , slowly pulling off his grey silk traveling gloves . " When I learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been too late to request an audience . I would not have done it in any case , however , because it would have been considered tactless and would have given a wrong impression at the very moment when Austrian Catholics were demanding an investigation of the legitimacy of the confiscation of Habsburg property . " <P> *Charlotte Aldegonde Elise Marie Wilhelmine , Grand Duchess of Luxemburg , sister-in-law of melancholy Zita.
