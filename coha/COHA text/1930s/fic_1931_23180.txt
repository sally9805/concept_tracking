POSTSCRIPT TO A CAREER A STORY BY ROLAND ENGLISH HARTLEY P ROFESSOR BELTON , sitting on his spread-out newspaper on the lowest step scooped in the hillside , directly in face of the level grassy space that served as stage , could see by a slight turn of his head in each direction that there were as many as ten or twelve rows behind him , following unevenly the slope of the hill . A brisk rattle of talk and laughter came to his ears . They were a larger , more vigorous group than he had suspected , the Pen-and-Ink Club . He wondered if all their sessions were as lively as this one , or whether now they had caught some spirit of freshness from the mild summer evening and the open sky above them and the tall eucalyptus trees that hemmed them in . He had n't looked forward to coming . These social obligations that clustered about his Summer School activities were a constant irritation to him . Why could n't they let a man teach , and gather in his leisure hours new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners where he must bow and smile and mutter nonsense like some mechanical toy ? At home he had built up a fairly impervious system of defenses about him ; but out here , confronted with the militant hospitality of the West , his evasions were less successful . From this present affair there had been no escape . Nearly half the members of his small class in story-writing were enrolled inthe Pen-and-Ink Club , and the course had scarcely commenced when he was assailed with urgent requests for his presence as guest of honor at this midsummer gathering . Sitting here now between Mrs. Totherwell and Miss Craig , giving only a part of his mind to the succession of singers and speakers , yielding himself much more to the charm of their setting  --  the bright little patch of green backed by the massive tree-trunks , like the columns of a temple , with the faint gray spread of the city visible between them and the misty line of the Bay beyond  --  Professor Belton was beginning to think that after all it was n't going to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , on the stage , and he learned who she was , and his mild acquiescence in being here became at once an eager delight . Her place on the program was immediately following that of a brisk little gray-haired lady who had capered somewhat embarrassingly about the green as she delivered children 's play-songs of her own composition . As he saw Mrs. Blake come forward onto the lawn  --  a good-looking , rather large woman in the late thirties , trimly clad and very sure of the impression she was going to make , yet throwing out with her smile a message of fellowship to include even the less important members of the assemblage  --  the guest of honor set his shoulders to meet the onset of a " number " quite as distressing as the last . Mrs. Blake read some verses . Her own , of course ; for the Pen-and-Ink Club , as had been amply explained to him , included only those who were " really " creating . Beyond the first few lines he gave up holding his mind to attention and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining sky of blue " and a city " sitting proudly on its hills . " Toward the close Mrs. Blake 's voice took on the full , deep tones of prophecy and devotion . Her verses set a glittering halo of renown about this Western city and then died away into clamorous applause . Before she could leave the stage , Mr. Larcott , the president of the Club , sprang forward and caught her arm . He had a pleasant little secret to tell the members . These stirring verses that had just delighted them had already been officially adopted by the Chamber of Commerce ; a large number of copies were to be printed in neat booklets , just the thing to send to Eastern friends . Another salvo of hand-clapping hailed Mrs. Blake 's triumph . Beaming with satisfied love of homage , she raised a hand in a gracious little gesture of deprecation . " She 's one of our most active members , " Miss Craig murmured warmly . And from the other side Mrs. Totherwell informed the Professor , " We 're awfully proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " Professor Belton faced sharply about to her . " Arnold Blake 's wife ? .. You do n't mean Arnold Blake the writer , do you ? " She glowed happily at having found this way to his interest . " Why , yes . You must meet her after a while . " " I certainly must . " He even made a slight move as if to rise and go atonce to where the lady had been engulfed in an ardent little group . But already Mr. Larcott was ushering onto the stage the next performer , a timid young man , whose hands trembled visibly under his manuscript . Professor Belton sank back in his place ; but through the remainder of the reading and singing and speaking he kept his gaze to the right , as if fearing that Mrs. Blake might suddenly take her leave . In that event he would unquestionably have risen and gone in pursuit . To think of coming upon the traces of Arnold Blake away out here , and in a gathering like this ! By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself had been summoned to the stage , to inform the Pen-and-Ink Club of his deep satisfaction at finding so far in the West this stalwart outpost of the creative life , the trees had dropped deep shadows over the snug little amphitheater , and in the city below the lights were coming on Guided by his two students and companions , Professor Belton now mounted the terraced hillside to the little plain on its crest where other activities were already going forward . A fire flamed brightly on an open hearth , with ranks of coffee-pots set before it ; paper plates and cups of granite-ware were being distributed ; young ladies were circulating with sandwiches . In rapid succession the guest of honor was provided with coffee , sugar , cream . " Do n't you lore these outdoor parties ? " Miss Craig demanded ardently . " Delightful ! " the Professor answered as he gently warded off with his sandwich a passing elbow that came perilously near to overturning his coffee . He let his glance roam about through the shifting groups , lit so fantastically by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other members of the Club were brought up to him and presented between mouthfuls ; but Mrs Blake , he perceived , was holding court of her own on the other side of the fire . " You must n't forget I 'm to meet her , " he reminded Mrs. Totherwell . Her smile was so arch that he felt called upon to explain . " Her husband 's work was one of my early enthusiasms . " " She 'll be able to tell you all about that , " his companion informed him . " They worked so wonderfully together . " And she later generously provided such full opportunity for this telling that the Professor and Mrs. Blake were seated side by side on a heavy wooden bench just on the fringe of the firelight , with its faint glow on their faces and the night closing in upon them from behind . " I did n't even know he had come out West , " the Professor said . " I just knew that suddenly there were no more of his stories ; and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here , " she said , " because they thought the change of climate might help . " " So it was . .. that . " " Yes , it was that . . . and the change came too late to do much good . " He shook his head slowly . The sense of loss was touching him as closely as if it were a death of yesterday they spoke of , and not of five years past . And then it came back to him how he had known this same sense of loss many years before while the man who occasioned it still walked the earth . " There are many things about his work I have often wondered about , " he said slowly . " You do n't mind talking of it , do your " Why , certainly not , Professor Belton ! " She even turned on the bench to face him more fully , as if to show how completely she was at his disposal . He looked away from her , off into the sinking flame of the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . " You see , I 've always been a student of writing . A critic , some people call it  --  though it 's much the same thing . And that means that I go wandering through deserts of print and come rarely to an oasis . Pardon this rambling , wo n't you ? What I 'm trying to say is that when I came upon your husband 's first book , I felt .. . vastly refreshed . " " You do n't mean Ways of Darkness , do you ? " she broke in . Yes , " he echoed , almost reverently , " War of Darkness . " " Those horrible stories ! " Mrs. Blake pronounced . Their eyes held together a moment over this clash of opinion , and then the Professor looked slowly back to the fire . His companion seemed to feel that the obligation rested upon her of establishing her point of view , for presently she said , in a conciliating tone , " Do n't you think those stories were very .. . harsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought them strong and brave and true , " he answered . " But there 's so much unhappiness in life , " she protested ; " why do we have to read about it ? " " A.h , you 'll soon be starting me off on my pet lecture , " he warned her . " One of the main points in it is that the sadness of our particular lives , which you speak of , is minimized for us by anything that helps us to see objectively the general sadness of human existence . Those first stories of Arnold Blake seemed to me to have a rare courage as well as a rare beauty . " " He wrote them before we were married , " she remarked now in a tone of finality that put all personal responsibility far from her . The implications of this statement made it more difficult for the Professor to go on ; but he was determined not to lose this chance of learning all he could of Arnold Blake ; and presently he offered , " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better , I hope , " she put in briskly . " Frankly , I could n't feel it as such . " She laughed easily . " We do n't seem to agree at all , do we , Professor , as to what constitutes good writing ? " Professor Belton was used to having his opinion in these matters deferred to , and there was a tinge of irony now in the smile that he turned from her toward the fire . " 1 had often wondered , " he said , " just what brought about the change . " The form of the verb he chose suggested that his wondering was now at an end ; but his companion , ignoring this , undertook to enlighten him . " Perhaps it was because he was happier himself . " The Professor 's social sense enabled him to how slightly in her direction and murmur , Unquestionably . " " He had had a pretty hard time to begin with , " she went on . " Never very well and strong , you know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then at last his book brought him recognition , and even a little money , and his social horizon broadened out ; and then our marriage " ? she gave a low , warm laugh ? " well , marriage is supposed to be for happiness , you know . " This time the Professor 's bow was not fortified with any audible comment . " And then , " she went on triumphantly , " success really began to come to him . You do n't seem to think very highly of his later writings ; but I wish you could have seen the letters that came to him from everywhere , telling him how much those stories meant to people . Do n't you think it 's success to be read by millions and to mean so much in their lives ? " He met her enthusiasm with a friendly smile , but said , " I ca n't answer that or you 'd be going about declaring me a cynic . " She settled herself hack on the bench . " Well , I was very proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am sure you were . " They sat then in silence a while , watching the groups that formed and dissolved and flowed together all about the narrow open space flanked by the lofty trees . Mrs. Blake 's face wore a quiet smile of contentment . Her way of greeting acquaintances that passed let the professor know how fully she was rejoicing in being seen in this close communion with him . The warmth of her satisfaction with the present spread itself out to cover what she said of the past . " Poor boy , " she suddenly began again , " he so hated to give up writing . " The Professor only nodded in silence and at once she went on , " He was quite convinced , you know , that at last he had come upon the right track for his work . We never even bad to argue about it any more . He was quite convinced . And then , when his strength was failing , it was pitiful to see how  --  well , how he lost hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to her quickly , but his eagerness met only her reminiscent smile . " He would keep on trying to write , no matter how bad it was for him ; and of course what he did under those conditions . . . " She ended with the vague flutter of a white hand in the dark . His eagerness now broke its bonds . " He did write something more , then ? " Again the white hand fluttered vaguely . " He kept on and on , even though we all urged him not to . And it was such a frightful waste of strength , driving himself to do that sort of thing . " " That sort of thing ? " he echoed dimly . " Oh , I do n't know why I 've been speaking about it at all . " She made a sudden movement on the bench , as if bringing herself wholly back to the present . " But you did seem interested , " she threw out , to justify herself . " I am very deeply interested , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spoken to anyone else of that last writing that Arnold did . It did n't seem quite . . fair to him . When an artist turns out bad work , in illness or anything of that sort , I think the least his friends can do is to keep it from being known , do n't you ? " He did n't answer her directly ; only , after a moment , said slowly , " You still have this  --  this last work of his ? " " Why , certainly ! " There was a ring of indignation in this . " I have every single one of Arnold 's manuscripts that he wrote after we were married . " He paused a little longer now before saying , " Would I be asking altogether too much , Mrs. Blake , if I begged for a glimpse of that last manuscript ? " " Oh , it 's nothing that would interest you at all , Professor Belton . You see , Arnold was really quite ill then ; he did n't finish it till just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly scrawled , some of it ; and I can assure you it would n't be worth your while to try deciphering it . " He could hear the tremor of eagerness in his words when he reminded her , " I have never been more interested in any contemporary writing than in that of your husband . " And he felt at once her gratified response to the eagerness . " Well , if you really want to , Professor Belton . " " I shall feel that a miracle has been offered me . " She laughed gaily and rose now from the bench with an air of once more assuming her proper position of importance . Details as to when he was to come to her for the manuscript were quickly arranged . He allowed his eagerness to be as breathless as it chose , for the pleasure that it obviously gave her . And now as the gathering was beginning to break up , and one after another of new acquaintances and older ones came to bid him good-night , he agreed smilingly with their merry comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long talk ! " and even chimed in warmly when various ones pressed Mrs. Blake 's arm and murmured , " I must tell you again , dear , how beautiful I thought your poem was ! " Mrs. Totherwell drove the guest of honor back to his quarters near the campus and on the way found it easiest to entertain him by telling him still more of Mrs. Blake . She spoke at fervent length of that lady 's importance in the Pen-and-Ink Club , and only regretted , in view of his manifest interest , that he could not be present at one of their meetings when Mrs. Blake talked of her husband 's work . This , it seemed , was one of the recurring features of their programs . " It is so  --  well , so heartening for our younger members to hear about it , " Mrs. Totherwell explained . These talks of Mrs. Blake , the Professor now learned from his companion 's brisk reporting of them , were chiefly concerned with her own subtle share in the creation . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know  --  his first stories were very drab and morbid . Then after he was married and began talking over the work with his wife , there was the most marvelous change in his writing ! We tell Mrs. Blake that her name ought to have gone down with his as collaborator ; but she is so very modest about taking any credit . And yet from what she tells us of the way he wrote it 's plain that the work was almost as much her own as his . Is n't it splendid when two people can work together and give the world such wonderful things ? " Sitting back in his comfortable dark corner of the sedan , the Professor found that only the briefest of noncommittal responses were needed , to keep the lady at the wheel in the full flood of her presentation of this chief glory of the Club . " Why , " she exclaimed , " we almost feel as if we had the famous Arnold Blake himself as a member , when we have her ! " And as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from Mrs. Blake 's personal importance , she hastened to add , " She writes such charming things herself . Like those verses to-night . Did n't you think they were fine ? " Here again a vague rejoinder could pass , in the prevailing tone of the talk , for glowing praise ; and a moment later as he climbed out before his door , the Professor could contribute his own note of warm sincerity when he thanked Mrs. Totherwell , and through her the Club , for giving him this most interesting evening . On the second afternoon following he sat with Mrs. Blake over the teacups in her apartment whose high windows looked across the campus to the wide , bright reach of the Bay . On the desk in the corner was a neat package that his fingers were tingling to get hold of . With his hostess 's round , full phrases in his ears , touching upon this thing and that , he had to keep himself constantly reminded that the amenities must be observed , that it would n't at all do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . The tea things cleared away , the package was transferred from its placeon the desk to Mrs. Blake 's wide lap , where her fingers played about it deliberately , conscious of the Professor 's eager gaze . " I ca n't imagine how I happened to tell you of this , " she murmured . Though she bestowed a warm smile upon him with this , the Professor was far from imputing to any personal charm or force this winning out of the secret . He thought he understood quite clearly how it had all come about . It was because he happened to be a person of some repute , whose eager interest in her husband 's work Mrs. Blake had somehow been able to feel as a tribute to her own importance . Under the warm spell of this gratification of her vanity she had expansively offered whatever she had that might prolong and intensify his interest . As her fingers hesitated over the cords , he let her know his wonder that for these five years she had kept this a secret . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she promptly explained , " I did n't want to do anything to hurt Arnold 's reputation . People were used to such fine things from him , you know ; and this , I 'm sorry to say , is something very different . Poor Arnold ! He worked so desperately , with his little strength , to get this thing done . And all the while I was hoping that it would be something truly great , that he was leaving as his last message . It was a very great disappointment to me to find that it was.9 this sort of thing . .. . But of course I should n't have expected too much ; the poor man was really not fit to be writing . " The Professor forgot his present eagerness now in going back with her into this intimate past . He could feel , as she talked , the drive of the man 's last gathered forces , until he himself was impelled to rise and go pacing about the narrow room . He could almost feel the presence of the sick man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of strength that could bring the work a little forward . ... Then at last the work was done , and all the little hoarded strength was spent in its doing . " And here it is . " Mrs. Blake put it in his hands . " I wish it were something better . But I know you will realize how it was written , and make allowances . " The Professor took the package reverently from her . As she walked with him to the door she said , " I ca n't quite forgive myself for letting this out of my hands . It does n't seem fair to . . . well , to all the ideals that Arnold and I were building up together in his work . But you will remember the circumstances , wo n't you He had fever always , those days . " That night , with the turning of the very first pages , the professor felt indeed a warmth coming out to him from these scrawled sentences  --  but it was the warmth of joyful recognition . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known in those first intrepid stories , but very , very far from the writer that he had later become , with his wife 's co-operation , in the quest for the thing that she had called success . More and more as he read the Professor could see the stricken man battling with his failing strength to get this thing done , to make this amends to his inner consciousness before the shadows should wholly close about him . Here was the stored wealth that had found no place in all the writing done to the world 's prescription , poured out now in one final lavish gesture . And if there sounded here and there a. note of bitterness , because the gift had been so long withheld , it was a note quickly lost in the vibrant tones of gladness , because the gift at last was being given . The Professor turned page after page , read on and on to the end . He willingly forgot the bundle of papers waiting in his brief-case . He read to the end and then he switched off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the thing pass before him again in the dark . It was a story that many people would call cruel because it was so like life . No bland evasions here , no casting of decorous drapings . Yet it left one with a sense of being strengthened , as all strong things do . Arnold Blake 's last story  --  a brief novel in length  --  was the account of the married life of a young musician . Professor Belton thought he had never found the infinite and subtle difficulties of human adjustment , and especially those of the marriage relationship , so fully revealed . The young people of the story had known hardship together , and then when greater prosperity came , it brought with it no sense of security but only unrest ; and when the inevitable separation ensued , the common verdict had put all blame on the husband . saying , " A little success went to his head ; she stood by him through the lean years , and now that those are past he thinks he has left her behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming , this judgment was just , but how it yet failed to take cognizance of all the deeper spiritual needs that must be satisfied if a companionship is not to be an empty thing . With his new knowledge of the past few days ready to hand , the Professor could not help reading in the story the author 's pent-up outcry against the circumstances of his own life . He knew enough of the processes of creation not to confuse the emotional quality with any personal feeling ; but here was an urgent tone of conviction that was not likely to be a casual effect . This personal element in the writing could not in the least affect its value as art  --  that it was art of a very high type the Professor was glowingly convinced  --  but it could , he reflected as he sat back there in the dark , make a tangled problem of it for the persons most nearly involved . Just what had Mrs. Blake seen , he wondered , in this last writing of her husband ? Surely its implications had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . For then , under no compulsion even of gratified vanity would she have let the manuscript out of her guarding . It certainly was not a thing to substantiate her claim to being the dominant influence toward the high creativeness of her husband 's life . A general kmowledge of this story , it occurred now to the Professor , would be very much inclined to weaken her prestige in the Pen-and-Ink Club . This thought made him smile , as he sat there in the dark ; and then it brought him to his feet , and he switched on the light as he began to pace the floor . He would have to he confoundedly careful what he said to that woman . He paced for as much as an hour before it became clear to him just how much he might safely say . To make even surer of this , he put off the saying of it for three whole days ; and when he then mounted the stairs again to Mrs. Blake 's bright room with the manuscript under his arm he felt reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . When he put the carefully wrapped package back into her hands she looked into his eyes searchingly for his judgment . " Well ? " she said at length . " I am very happy to have had the opportunity of reading it , " he told her . She gave a little laugh that held a note of relief . " Of course , I did n't expect you to be very enthusiastic . " " It 's a most interesting piece of work , " he slowly pronounced . She took this up brightly . " Oh , Arnold 's work was always interesting . " Their eyes held together a moment over this ; and gradually there came into hers that same anxious , penetrating glance that had been there when she first let the manuscript out of her hands . " Did n't you find it rather . . . feverish " " Only with the fever that is in all art , " the Professor cautiously rejoined . " Art ? " " I really think we ought to publish this , Mrs. Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she made no answer , but only kept her eyes keenly upon his own , he asked , " Did n't he want it published ? " " He said that I was to do just as I wanted with it . " Here it was again , he realized , this devastating battle between personal loyalty and artistic integrity that had lasted to the end . Mrs. Blake stood there before him , looking down , waiting for something further from him . In a moment he let her have just this much , " I consider this a very fine thing , Mrs. Blake . You need n't worry about its effect on your husband 's reputation . It 's the very thing to make that unshakably secure . " Still she seemed to find nothing to say , and the Professor now delivered what he had planned as his most telling stroke . " The publication of this would be sure to stir up a lot of critical comment . Very favorable comment , I can promise you . Arnold Blake would he in the limelight again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried days an author who is n't constantly producing soon drops a little out of the procession . This would put him right back on the front page . " He was aware that his figure was growing confused ; but at least his f fervor had not failed of its effect . Mrs. Blake 's eyes came up to him warmly . " That would be very nice , " she said . " I felt sure it was what you would want to do for his memory , " the Professor tactfully observed . Shc bent again over the manuscript that she still held in her two hands . " You know , I have n't looked at this for years . I must read it again at once , to see what we are offering the world . " The glance that she lifted to him with this was so lucid that the Professor felt an inward tremor . " Remember , when you read it , that you have my authority that it 's very fine . " " Would you write an introduction to it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even said it again , " Gladly , " and at once repented of this superfluous ardor . " Well , talk to you again about it before you go . " And when he was at the door she said gaily , " It 's fortunate you came out here this summer , Professor Belton , or else I might never have brought that manuscript out of its dark corner . And now I ca n't tell you how eager I am to read it again ! " He met her bright smile brightly . " And we 'll give Arnold Blake 's fame a brand new start ! " He even , after an instant , felt it safe to add , " Mrs. Totherwell has told me how proud they all are of you and him . This will make them very happy . " Her glance was pleased but not at all disarmed . She was not a stupid woman , he reflected . " I thank you for the privilege you have given me , Mrs. Blake , " he said gravely . And " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he started down the stairs . He heard nothing from her for several days . This was the final week ofthe session now , and on Friday night Professor Belton would take the eastward train . During these last days he kept wondering whether he might , without appearing too urgent , call Mrs. Blake to ask what judgment her rereading of the manuscript had Ied to ; but he decided he must wait patiently to the end for some further word . And then , on the final morning of the session , when he stepped into his classroom for the last time , there was Mrs. Blake in the back row between Mrs. Totherwell and Miss Craig . There were other visitors too , he quickly noted ; the distinction of his class had made talk on the campus ; but it was only to Mrs. Blake that he gave his brief glance of welcome , that she answered with a little nod and a friendly smile . All through his summing up of the points of the course , he was conscious of her presence back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campanile , and the class was over , and his disciples of these six weeks came crowding around his desk to say good-by , he found his usual valedictory heartiness forsaking him , in the face of his eagerness to talk with Mrs. Blake . This reserve on his part so speeded the farewells that before many minutes the door had swung shut behind the last of his students , and only Mrs. Blake was left facing him across the desk . She came forward quickly with the same outheld hand and grateful smile that each of the others had offered him . " I do want to thank you , Professor Belton . It was so interesting . " For her , too , he had his slight , formal , wordless bow , as his hands moved busily about the desk assembling odd sheets of paper . " Every single morning , " Mrs. Blake went on fervently , " I 've been telling myself that I must come down to hear you . But life is so crowded , you know . And now to think that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramming the gathered papers into his brief-case . " Do you walk across the campus , Professor ? " she asked hopefully . Her way , he knew , was not quite his ; but he gladly set off beside her along the sunny path . As soon as she stopped talking he would ask her about the manuscript . But that moment seemed still remote , for Mrs. Blake was well launched on an ardent analysis of all the forms the lasting influence of Professor Belton would take upon the community after his brief summer sojourn among them . This subject carried her quite across the campus . It was still reverberating about her when they halted at her apartment house door . " Well , here we are already , " she sighed . And then she suddenly remembered of herself that there was still another subject to be broached . " Oh , I must tell you about that manuscript . " The Professor felt that he was meeting her eyes too eagerly and looked away . " It 's the strangest thing , " his companion chattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't read that story for several years . Not since soon after Arnold 's death . I found it very interesting , going through it again . Ihad it out there on my table while I was reading it , and one afternoon while I was out it must have blown off into the waste basket , and of course that happened to be the very afternoon my cleaning woman came , and .. . well , it 's gone ! " She ended on a clear high note that had no ring of disaster . The professor found himself staring at her stupidly and mumbling like a schoolboy . " You mean . . . it 's . . it 's de-stroyed ? " " No question of it , " she answered brightly . " Down the chute into the incinerator . " He met for a moment the level defiance of her glance before he looked down and said gravely , " It 's a very great loss . " She had out her key now and was putting it to the lock . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It seemed to me very much like his earlier work . You know , I could n't at all agree with you about that . And now " ? she laughed brightly again ? " now the world will never be able to decide between us . " Their eyes held together as she gave him her hand . What the Professor saw was a merry little glint of triumph . " Good-by , Professor Belton , " she said as he moved away and she turned to the door . " Good-by . We sha n't forget you . "
