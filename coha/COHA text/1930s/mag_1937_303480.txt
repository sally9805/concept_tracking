( See front cover ) <P> With all the stories in the world to choose from , which story would a shrewd cinema producer pick to coincide with the coronation of a King of England ? This was one problem which last year faced Warner Brothers ' Associate Executive in Charge of Production Hal Wallis . For a cinema producer , problems never come singly . Another and more difficult riddle for Producer Wallis was this : what were the best roles in which to cast two 12-year-old identical twins who looked so much alike that their mother could scarcely tell them apart ? One test of a cinema producer is his ability to solve two problems at the same time . Ready for simultaneous release in 275 U. S. cities last week was Producer Wallis ' exceedingly neat finesse of his dilemma : Billy &; Bobby Mauch in Mark Twain 's The Prince and the Pauper , last made as a silent picture with Marguerite Clark playing both roles in 1915 . <P> The Prince and the Pauper starts on the day in 1537 when boy infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Pickpocket John Canty in Offal Court . Young Prince Edward thrives at the court , under the tutelage of the Duke of Norfolk ( Henry Stephenson ) . Young Tom Canty thrives in the gutter , with Latin lessons from Father Andrew and whackings from his father ( Barton MacLane ) . Prowling about London one day , Tom crawls under a bench outside the castle to take a nap . The Captain of the Guard hauls him out and is giving him a thrashing when Prince Edward comes out of the palace to call his dog . Prince invites pauper indoors to play .

As things shape up , he seems in a fair way to accomplish it . <P> Another notion of Mark Twain 's was that monarchies would do better if kings saw how their subjects lived . In medieval London 's alleys , Edward fares not much better than his counterpart in the palace until he encounters a young soldier of fortune named Miles Hendon ( Errol Flynn ) . Hendon feeds him , humors his apparently preposterous notion that he is the King of England , sets out , when the boy is kidnapped , to rescue him from John Canty 's gang of thieves .
