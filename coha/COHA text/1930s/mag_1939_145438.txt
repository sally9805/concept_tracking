To the most mercilessly public spot a U. S. citizen can go , before Senate Committee for public inspection , last week went the three highest appointees of Franklin Roosevelt 's Fourth New Deal . Before blinking flashlights , surrounded by a battery of anti-New Deal Senators , the new Supreme Court Justice , new Attorney General , new Secretary of Commerce-three men of the boldest New Deal stripe - made their bows to the nation . Their confirmation was a foregone conclusion , but they and their opponents knew that the impression that they gave might well affect the future course of politics . Each put on an able , articulate , characteristic show . <P> Frankfurter . In deference to the dignity of the Supreme Court a Judiciary subcommittee offered , and Felix Frankfurter accepted , a chance to let him appear not in person but through counsel . Dapper Dean Acheson , onetime Under Secretary of the Treasury , appeared for him and heard an assortment of minor patriots condemn his client as a Red , a Jew , an alien . One condemner was rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago , who based her Frankfurterphobia largely on his long membership in the American Civil Liberties Union ( which once defended her right to attack the New Deal on the radio ) . <P> After such aspersions , the committee felt obliged to call the Professor in person . Small , well-brushed and jaunty , his pince-nez sparkling in 40 flashlights , he appeared . The audience could not have been bigger or more enthusiastic had he been Shirley Temple . With some acerbity he questioned the propriety of Senators publicly examining a nominee for the nation 's highest court. * With feeling he told how his father , a Viennese Jew , had " fallen in love " with America on a business trip , brought his family over in 1894 . <P> When it came to questioning , the examiners were no match for their witness . Nevada 's tawny old Pat McCarran was confounded by the Professor 's Socratic questions . Asked by Senator Borah how the Civil Liberties Union stood on Communism , the Professor neatly replied , " So far as I know it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Communists get their Constitutional rights , along with Henry Ford , the Nazis and the Klan . " Climax came when , pointing his finger at McCarran , Lawyer Frankfurter said slowly and succinctly : <P> " I do not believe , Senator , that you have ever taken the oath to support the Constitution of the United States with less reservation than I have , or would now , nor do I believe you are more attached to the theories and practices of Americanism than I am . " <P> The audience cheered and applauded . <P> Felix Frankfurter remained composed . An hour later the committee voted to confirm him . <P> Murphy . The Judiciary sub-committee did not bother to call Frank Murphy before approving him as Attorney General . But he , whose nonenforcement of a court order to eject sit-down strikers from a General Motors plant at Flint in 1937 had been cited against him , was not satisfied . He asked to appear to give " the real , inside story " of his sit-down conduct , which he had never told because " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now that he was no longer Governor he would speak .
