Ourselves Alone ( Gaumont-British ) , whose title is a free translation of the Gaelic Sinn Fein , differs from Hollywood investigations of that Irish revolutionary group by approaching it from a temperate and somewhat more realistic British viewpoint . Not entirely neglecting the poetry of The Informer and The Plough And The Stars or the star-crossed romance of Beloved Enemy , Ourselves Alone is concerned chiefly with the hard lot of the <P> Black- &-Tans,; those hard-bitten ex-Army men who were sent to Ireland in 1920 to shoot it out with the Nationalist guerrillas . Irish County Inspector Hannay ( John Lodge ) and British Captain Wiltshire of the Royal Intelligence Corps ( John Loder ) both dedicated to preserving British law &; order , have captured a pair of important emissaries from Sinn Fein headquarters but their lorry is hijacked by a mysterious local Sinn Fein chieftain named Commandant O'Dea ( Niall MacGinnis ) . Neither suspects that O'Dea is the high spirited young brother of Maureen Elliot ( Antoinette Cellier ) , the Irish girl with whom both are in love .

After an un-happy series of roles in Hollywood climaxed when he appeared opposite Marlene Dietrich in The Scarlet Empress in a neck-length wig , vigorous , clean-cut Cinemactor Lodge seems to have found a niche in British cinema . So pleased were his producers by his work in Ourselves Alone that he is now under a long-term starring contract .

Stella Martin ( Barbara Stanwyck ) is the daughter of one millworker and the sister of another but when an eccentric Harvard socialite comes to Millhampton and goes to work in his shirt sleeves , she sees a chance for advancement . Soon Stella and Stephen Dallas ( John Boles ) are married and the parents of a dimpled baby girl , whom they name Laurel .
