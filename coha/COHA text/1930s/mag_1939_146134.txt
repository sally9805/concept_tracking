Most psychologists firmly believe that companionship with intelligent parents and playmates is the most important factor in a child 's mental development . The Emperor of Japan shares this view ( see p. 31 ) . But last week at the Chicago meeting of the American Association for Mental Deficiency , Psychologist Harold Manville Skeels of the State University of Iowa , questioned this old belief . <P> Dr. Skeels told how he took 13 mentally retarded pre-school infants away from a bleak Iowa orphanage packed with healthy , intelligent moppets , and placed them in a home for feeble-minded girls . The inmates lavished upon the deficient babies a wealth of feeble-minded love . They made them toys , watched them play , gave them plenty of room to run around . Within two years , to the psychologist 's amazement , the intelligence quotients of twelve of the orphans rose sharply , in some cases as much as 40 points , and they appeared superior in intelligence to their playmates in the asylum . Later , seven of them were adopted . During the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded asylum , and received no affection , slowly drifted into feeblemindedness . <P> Psychologist Skeel 's conclusion : more than anything else , for mental growth children need " adult affection and stimulation , " no matter from whom it comes .
