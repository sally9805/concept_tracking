One night last week five men filed softly into the White House and sat down with President Roosevelt for a secret talk . They were his legislative lieutenants at the Capitol-Vice President Garner , Speaker Rainey , Senate Leader Robinson , House Leader Byrns and Senator Pat Harrison . There had been in the month past many such night conferences at the White House whence participants had returned to Congress with their Presidential orders . But this one was different . The five Democrats emerged with their lips sealed . Not until the next day did the meeting become generally known and even then other Senators and Representatives could pry nothing out of the conferees . Speaker Rainey tried to divert the Press 's interest by outlining a legislative program for the next two months which required no tip-toe visit to the White House to ascertain . <P> One result of the White House conference was to increase the crop of rumors to the effect that President Roosevelt was dangerously close to losing control of Congress . Without White House sanction the Senate had passed a 30-hour work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that it was " emergency legislation " from the President , the House had whipped through a censorship bill that outraged the Press . Committee chairmen balked at sponsoring important White House measures . Democratic Senators could be privately heard muttering about " a President who thinks he always has to be doing something , right or wrong . " The college professors President Roosevelt had taken into high office were scorned as " second-raters . " Complaints were made that the bills sent up from the White House were messily drafted , always had to be redrawn . The House had got into the habit of railroading major legislation through one day a week and blowing off political steam the other five . Its committee discharge rule was stiffened as a precaution against revolt . The President had been five weeks in the White House and yet his brand of magic had not yet produced a boom . The cry for currency inflation grew louder . <P> But the true temper of Congress was not to be accurately judged by such backstage talk . There were some hurt prides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip hand over the Capitol . The pressure of public opinion was as strong as ever in his favor . Party patronage had yet to be distributed in a big way . The swift tempo of the first few weeks was over with the passage of emergency legislation but the change in Congressional pace did not signify a change in spirit . Most observers were agreed that the President could get anything he wanted throughout the special session . <P> The preponderant effect of the Roosevelt program to date has been drastically deflationary . Four billion dollars was tied up in closed banks . Public savings curtailed private spendings . Even the psychological advantage of a balanced budget failed to offset this downward trend . Last week , however , the President 's larger program became more clear . The budget was to be balanced so that the Government could borrow fresh billions and thereby prime the pump of U. S. business ! Credit inflation on a colossal scale loomed ahead . Only if it failed to produce results would the White House lend an ear to the moonlit baying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
