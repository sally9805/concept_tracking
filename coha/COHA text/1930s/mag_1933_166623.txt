Last week swart Inquisitor Ferdinand Pecora of the Senate Banking &; Currency Committee wound up his efforts to pin scandal on J. P. Morgan &; Co. by trying to prove that its partners had been evading income taxes ( see p. 13 ) . Not content to let the inquiry end upon this note , the House of Morgan countered by making two statements . First was a memorandum submitted by John P. Morgan answering Mr. Pccora 's criticisms : <P> 1 ) That he and his partners had paid $51,000,000 in income taxes from 1917 to 1929 - $11,000,000 in the latter year - a substantial part of the total due to capital gains . Since 1930 their profits have all been wiped out by losses . " . . . Income taxes are , after all , payable upon income and not upon deficits . " <P> 2 ) That their common stock sales at cost amounted to less than of their securitv business . In most cases the sale price was fixed before there was any market for the stocks . " Every successful issuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had the experience of seeing its issues quoted above the issue price while the offering is still open . ... It is not the practice of responsible bankers and dealers in pricing a new equity issue to charge all the traffic will bear-it would be inexcusable to do so in an inflation market such as prevailed in 1929 . . . . " <P> 3 ) That their private customers were selected because of long business and personal relations , not for political influence . " It seems extraordinary that we should be taken to task . . . simply because chance has brought some of them into high office and mischance has impaired the fortunes of others . " <P> 4 ) That they have habitually made statements of condition to the Federal Reserve Bank and " are ready to be examined by the Federal Reserve bank at any time and as often as may be desired . " <P> Second statement came from Morgan Partner Russell Cornell Leffingwell . The Senate investigators were supposed to be engaged not in a scandal hunt but in an effort to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improved . Mr. Leffingwell 's statement was aimed at this obscured point . Coming at any less exciting time , it would undoubtedly have been front-page news . His points : <P> In 1927 to counteract the beginnings of world deflation the Federal Reserve Bank lowered its discount rate which produced stockmarket speculation without having much effect on business . <P> The Federal Reserve instead of raising its rate to stop wild speculation shilly-shallied all through 1928 , till August 1929 . <P> Raising the discount rale in August 1929 , and the Hatry crisis in London , precipitated the debacle which was spurred on in 1930 when the Hawley-Smoot tariff threw a monkey wrench into world commerce , in 1931 by the failure of the Creditanstalt in Austria , the German moratorium and England 's abandoning gold . The Glass-Steagall bill produced improvement last summer which was promptly undone by President Hoover 's Des Moines speech ( " could not hold to gold . . . but two weeks longer " ) , controversy over War Debts and publication of R. F. C. loans which caused runs on banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
