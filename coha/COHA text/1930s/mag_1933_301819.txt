Pursued by panting newsfolk of normal size who could barely keep up with his towering strides , the fifth son of the 26th Earl of Crawford loped around to a side door of the British Foreign Office last week . <P> While cameramen chorused , " Just one more , Sir Ronald ! " he posed for an instant , cheerfully waggling his umbrella . " You all know why I am here , " he said , then popped inside for a 45-minute conference with his diplomatic chief , Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon . When the two emerged together tall Sir John , who was hatless , seemed dwarfed by taller Sir Ronald Lindsay , Ambassador to the U. S. of His Majesty King George . Chatting with animation , Sir John and Sir Ronald crossed to No. 10 Downing St. In the white and gold Cabinet Room they were greeted by Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald , Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain and the rest of Britain 's " Big Five " Debt Committee , all eager to hear from Sir Ronald what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional leaders . <P> Soon the Associated Press rumored exclusively that the " Big Five " were thinking of offering to settle with the U. S. on the basis of a lump sum payment of between $1,250,000,000 and $2,000,000,000 . Next day British editors called so big a lump " over-optimistic . " In Washington Democrat Rainey bristled : " I think I can say that Congress will not for roughly ' ' a dime on the dollar " of her 1933 agreement to pay the U. S. some $11,000.000,000 over 62 years . Since Germany 's Reparations debt to the Allies was scaled down , provisionally , at Lausanne at 1 on the $1 Britons were shocked by U. S. scorn of a dime . <P> But soon after Sir Ronald advised the Big Five , leading newsorgans started to tell Britons for the first time in months that the U. S. Government has a ' ' real case " for collection because much of the U. S. has really been prostrated by Depression. * <P> " There may be developments of a disturbing kind in the near future in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " though desperate efforts to avert them are being made . " <P> Various Plans . In the Lindsay blood is a flair for stamp collecting ( his father 's U. S. stamps alone brought $200,000 when sold to a U. S. citizen ) , a penchant for the U. S. ( Sir Ronald is the relict of one moneyed U. S. woman , the husband of another ) and a winning way which has kept Lindsays in Parliament for nearly 500 years . <P> To win Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's approval , Sir Ronald tucked into his briefcase an assortment of new British plans , one reputedly a " lump sum " offer , sailed on the S. S. Majestic " with full instructions . "
