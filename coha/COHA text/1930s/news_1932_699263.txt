" Among the important provisions now to consider are : " How far shall we go in the percentage of alcohol ? We took the 2.75 by weight , advocated chiefly by the American Federation of Labor , because we believed this would be sustained by the Supreme Court of the United - States as not ' intoxicating in fact , ' especially in view of the voluminous testimony to this effect before the Judiciary Committee of the House . " We also understood that most good beers sold before prohibition were not much stronger , and we wanted , of course , to avoid any delay caused by litigation . Is this percentage high enough ?
