In half-a-dozen U. S. cities last week , hundreds of people walked into newspaper offices , walked out again with armsful of symphonic phonograph records . The records cost them , not the usual $1.50 or $2 per disk , but about 50 . And they were good : staple works of Schubert , Beethoven , Tschaikowsky , etc . But what orchestras performed them , what company recorded them , was not revealed on the label . <P> J. David Stern 's New York Post , which gave itself periodic shots in the arm until George Backer bought it and took it out of the narcotic ward last week , began selling cheap records as a promotion stunt last winter . The Post 's Business Manager Jacob Omansky , ardent music-bibber , invented the scheme : the paper commissioned RCA Victor to make a series of special recordings , guaranteeing their cost ( $150,000 ) should the venture fail . The music to be recorded was chosen by the Post 's Musicritic Samuel Chotzinoff , a key figure in the plan because he is close to RCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend . Keeping it under their hats , such orchestras as the New York Philharmonic , the New Friends of Music Orchestra recorded such works as the Beethoven Fifth Symphony , the Mozart G-Minor Symphony . Post readers could get each album ( three or more disks ) by presenting 24 vouchers clipped from the paper , plus $1.93 in cash . From the first week-during which Jacob Omansky died - the venture was a success . Up to last week , when the eighth of the album series was released , 200,000 albums had been distributed . And meantime , the stunt had begun to spread . <P> The Washington Star , a conservative paper which rarely looks promotion in the face , admired the Post 's campaign , made a deal with Publishers Service Inc. , a Stern promotion subsidiary to take it over , cleansed completely of its voucher-clipping taint . The Star organized a National Committee for Music Appreciation , plugged the Committee and music in general to the top of its bent , began distributing records last February at $1.39 per set . Distribution to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Committee offered the album scheme to other papers-always with the stipulation : no coupons , no subscription drives in connection with it . By last week , the Los Angeles Times , Buffalo Courier-Express , Portland ( Ore . ) Journal , Oakland Tribune , Philadelphia Record had signed up . In each case the Committee kept the origin of the records secret .
