Under the glaring lights of Reno 's Harold 's Club last week a dozen ugly , hybrid* mice blinked beady eyes at the crowd of divorcees , lawyers , barflies crowding into the gambling room . Manager R. I. Smith was trying out a new invention . An attendant hauled a shrinking mouse out of a coop , dropped him on a flat , glass wheel . Frightened , the mouse started to sprint . The wheel spun . When it began to slow down , the mouse sought shelter in one of the 56 glass cages , each marked with a playing card . This time he darted beneath the jack of clubs . The croupier scooped up the chips , paid 50 to 1 on straight bets on the jack . <P> Played like roulette , with the mouse replacing the white ball , the game , called Cardette , is the brainchild of 28-year-old Gambling Dealer Everett MacDonald . Cardette , says Inventor MacDonald , requires no bait , ca n't be fixed , pays better odds than roulette . <P> Throughout the evening MacDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh one . But the spectators got so excited over the mouse 's antics that they forgot to place their bets regularly . Manager Smith , annoyed , swore : " There will never be another mouse game in this club . " During the tryout one frightened mouse escaped . Another , indifferent to the croupier 's threats and pleadings , made for the centre of the wheel , where he sat down , unabashedly licked himself from head to tail . <P> * A cross between tame &; wild mice , they were supposed to be more fearful , less amenable to training , than either .
