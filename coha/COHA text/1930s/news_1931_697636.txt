txt In the face of a final warning from President Hoover , the Senate Committee on Finance , by a vote of 13 to 3 , today ordered a favorable report on the veterans ' bonus loan bill , which was passed by the House Monday by the overwhelming majority of 363 to 39 . The Senate at once agreed to take up the bill tomorrow and the indications are that it will be passed by tomorrow night . No change was made in the language of , the Rouse measure . If the bill goes through the Senate as approved by the House and the committee , it will be in the hands of the President possibly by tomorrow evening , in time to prevent him from pigeon-holing it by a pocket veto . As matters stand , the President , if there is no delay in the Senate , will be obliged to approve or veto the measure . Tliat he will veto it is generally accepted . Passage Over Veto Is Expected . That the Pliuse will pass the bill again over a veto goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill said that there is a chance that its proponents may not have enough votes to pass it over a veto , opinion is practically unanimous that the Senate will follow the example of the House . The President ? voiced his protest in a letter to Senator Smoot , chairman of the committee . It was the outcome of conferences at the White House yesterday evening in which Senators Smoot , Reed and others participated . Summarizing his objections to the bill , the President reiterated those raised publicly by Secretary Mellon and Under-Secretary Mills of the Treasury . He offered no objection to providing aid for veterans of the World War who are suffering privation , but stressed that " the country had not been called upon , however , either directly or indirectly , to support or make loans to those who can by their own efforts support them-selves : " Declaring it to be a misunderstanding that the cash for ' financing the loans was already in the treasury , the President explained , that $700 , - 000,000 was held as a reserve against the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This reserve was in government securities , however . ' and " the cash required by the veterans can only be secured by , the sale of these securities to the public . " Says $1,000,000,000 Is Required . According to the President , who based his estimate on a letter from . General Hines , administrator of veterans ' affairs , about $1,000,000,000 would be required to make the loans called for , and provision would have to be made " at once " to overcome the prospective deficiency . The bilI would not " only nullify the benefits to the veterans , but inflict injury on the country as a whole , " - Mr . Hoover wrote , and the statement was looked upon as indicating a veto . The letter was read when the Finance Committee was in session to hear arguments against the bill from Mr. Mills and General Hines . Senator Harrison asked " if it la the interpretation of the chairman that the President would veto the bill ? " " I rather think he would , " answered Senator Smoot . " A fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would probably veto it unless a number of these faults were corrected . " Both Senators Smoot and Reed , however , disclaimed any specific information as to the President 's attitude . That no change will be made it ! the House measure by the Benet* seems to be certain . In sanctioning it today . ' the committee did not amend it in any way . There were reports that the committee might reauce the House interest rate on bonus loans from 41/2 to 4 per cent , but , while motions to change some of the bill 's provisions were made and all voted down , no suggestion to modify the rate was made . In some quarters it is held that President Hoover might help himself politically by letting the bill become law , but even among many ? supporters of the administration the view is held that he would injure his prestige by going contrary to what every one knows is his positive antagonism to the measure . The more widespread view - is that , while the President might lose support among some beneficiaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applauded as a courageous and selfrespecting act . Committee Votes 13 to 3 . ? After hearing Under Secretary Mills and General Hines In open session , the Finance Committee closed its doors . It was on a motion by Sen-. . ator Harrison that the committee balloted , voting 13 to 3 to : report the bill unchanged , with a reeommendation that it be passed . The three committeemen voting in the negative were Senators Smoot , Reed and Bingham , all Republicans . The affirmative votes were by , Senators Watson , Shortridge , ' Couzens , . Keyes , La Follette and Thomas of Idaho , Republicans , and Simmons , Harrison , George , Walsh of Massachusetts , Barkley , ' Thomas of Oklahoma and Connally , Democrats . Senator Simmons was absent and his ' vote was cast by proxy . Senator King , Democrat , ? of Utah , who had sought to amend the bill , withheld his vote . Senator Smoot reported the bill to the Senate at 12:30 o'clock without comment . A short time later Senator Harrison asked unanimous consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets tomorrow and this was finally agreed to , after Senators Howell and King argued over whether their own pet measures should ' have right of way when the bonus was disposed of . Mr. Howell was anxious to give preference to the bill for ? stricter prohibition enforcement in the District of Columbia and Mr. King demanded action on one regarding the deportation of certain alien seamen . Senators , Howell , Trammell and Barkley advocated taking up the bonus measure at once , but Senators Smoot and Robinson of Arkansas advised that a wait until tomorrow would be better . " We can dispose of the bonus bill easily , tomorrow in . a short discusSion , Mr. Smoot said . " It will be acted on tomorrow , I am sure . " Senator Harrison , desiring action , alluded to the " liability ' of a pocket veto . " President 's Backing Dwindles . A check-up of Senators who may be counted on to vote against over riding a veto . did not serve to encourage the measure 's antagonists . A few days ago it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirtyon:iotes sight to-sustain a veto , including Republican Senators who intended to vote for the bill but were expected to stand by the President  --  in his disapproval . Yesterday the estimate had dwindled to possibly no more than twenty-five , whereas thirty-three votes would be necessary to sustain the President . Judging by the vote of 13 to 3 in the committee today , the bill is likely to go through the Senate by the proportionate vote of more than ' four to one . Several amendments offered to the Finance Committee were rejected . A substitute proposed by Senator Walsh of Massachusetts provided for lending up to $150 without interest to veterans in actual distress . It was beaten 9 to 8 . Favoring it were Senators Watson , Smoot , Reed , Shortridge , Keyes and Bingham , Republicans , and Walsh and King , Democrats . The opposition included Senators Couzens , La Follette and Thomas , Republicans ; Simmons , Harrison , George , Barkley , Thomas and Connally , Democrats . An amendment by Senator Thomas of Oklahoma to eliminate interest charges on money due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortridge and King and the author . Senator Reed 's amendment to make loans only to those who have already borrowed , was defeated 12 to 5 , and Senator King 's amendment to require 7proof of distress ? was beaten , $200,000 ; 000 - without disturbing the financial situation . " Mr. Mills explained the difficult financing which is ahead of the treasury even , without the enactment of the bonus loan bill . " We have got to borrow $1,200 , - 000,000 on March 15 , irrespective of this legislation , " he said . " We have a very heavy financing operation in sixteen months and another in three years . Irrespective of the $1 , $00 , - 000,000 to be obtained on March 15 , the Treasury , in the next two and a half years , must turn a very large proportion of its short-term debt , amounting to $2,800,000,000 , into king-term securities . There is a great plenty of short-term money. , but ' the market for long-term securities is not so good . " In view of General Hines 's estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through we would n't dare start the March quarter with less than $400,000,000 on hand for use under its provisions . " If we have to- borrow $400,000,000 for this purpose on March 15 , we will ' have to borrow altogether on that date $1,600,000,000 . Of this , $1 , - 100,000,000 will be for a refunding operation , and $100,000,000 for -- Current expenditures . It will mean $500 , - 000,000 of new money for which we shall . have to go to the bond market . It is just plain sense for the government to keep out of the security markets at the present time . " We would need another $400,000 , - 000 under this bill for the quarter beginning June 15 . " Insists Cash Must Be Raised . Senator Barkley suggested that such an amount would not consume the whole total of the maturity fund now provided for retiring the bonus certificates due in 1945 , but Mr. Mills insisted that the proposal in the bill constituted a cash problem , with the March borrowing pf $1,200,000 , - 000 . By October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,250,000,000 in Liberty Bonds , and start disposing of them before they mature in 1938 . " Irrespective of the transaction next month , " said Mr. Mills , " the treasury in two and one-half years Must turn a large portion of its short-term debt into long-term securities , with a prospect of not cutting the public debt in any great amount . It is the most difficult problem of financing the Treasury Department has faced in ten years . " Estimating a deficit of ? $500,000,000 at the close of the fiscal year , and forecasting a smaller deficit in the fiscal year 1932 , Mr. Mills said : " In fact , we will increase the public debt this year , and if we reduce it in the next three years period , we will be lucky to reduce it $800,000 , - , 000 in this time . " When Senator Barkley said the treasury had already reduced . the public debt $3,500,000,000 beyond legal requirements , Mr. Mills retorted that he did not think Congress hadintended. to confine the retirement entirely to the ? sinking fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will pull out of the deficit dif- ' ficulty if you will let us- alonetls. ' 4. bei asserted , while discussing increased ; appropriations and decreased revenues . Senator Couzens asked hOw the ? treasury had " blundered " in , issuing what Mr. Mills had said were too many short-term certificates . To this Mr. Mills answered : " I did n't say it was a blunder ; it ? appeared good judgment then . " The prospective deficit of $500,000 , - 000 can be carded along this year at the expense of any reduction in the public debt , Mr. Mills observed , but this can not be done indefinitely . Hines Urges Two Amendments . Under examination by the committee , General Hines recommended two amendments to the bill . One was for a limitation of the loans to veterans in distress , while the other was for spreading the loans over monthly or quarterly payments . General Hines estimated that there were 200,000 unemployed veterans , basing his estimate on a total of 4,000.000 unemployed persons . Some members of the committee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent of the value of his $1,000 certificate , the General said , at 41/2 per cent interest compounded annually , would eat up all but $74.03 of the remaining 50 per cent during the fourteen years before maturity . If 41/2 per cent simple interest were used , there would remain $185 . If the rate were 4 per cent compound interest , there would remain $134 , while at 4 per cent simple interest the balance would be $220 . Although the House passed the bill Monday , there was a discussion of its provisions in that body this afternoon while the second annual deficiency appropriation bill was being considered . Representative - Hamilton Fish of New York declared it was a misnomer to term it a bonus bill , as it did not provide a gift but a loan to veterans of money due them . He expressed confidence that the treasury could make advances to veterans under the bill and actually save money through.borrowing at 3 per cent and lending the : .. money to veterans at 41/2 per cent - as provided by the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " safest , soundest and sanest , " that could - be passed . " Yet , " he declared , " bankers and business men and editors have been misled to believe that the House has done an iniquitous thing . is ' time the facts were known and the ; House of Representatives had its interests protected . If a conservative ' measure was ever passed , this was the measure . In my judgment it wars too conservative . An interest - rate of 4 per cent would have been ainple. " 10 to . Mills States Treasury Objections . Under-Secretary Mills told the committee that the bill would destroy the basic principle of the bonus policy established by Congress in 1924 and ? would hasten agitation for pension legislation as well as create difficulties in financing . " Congress decided very definitely , " he said , " that it was to the benefit of the veteran to receive an ' endowment insurance policy instead of cash as adjusted - compensation . Congress had very ' definitely in mind the idea of limiting the loan value so that the veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The amount of loans was fixed on a scale based on actuarial computations . I am not inclined to insist - on the actuarial ' end of it , but I do think that this legislation very definitely . reopens the whole question and goes back to the original discussion as , to whether the adjusted compensation shall be in the form of cash . " Once you break down the principle there will- be further attempts to get cash , . and long before you get to .1945 you will have paid all of the adjusted compensation . The next step is a pension , and when you get to a pension for 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 veterans , the cost is going to be perfectly ' staggering . Would Limit It to the Needy . " If we are going to preserve ? the principle of the Original law , we ought to limit the bill to those in need . If the purpose of this bill is to aid veterans.:In distress because of the business depression , and I have heard no other fyrgument for It , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing to go that far , and I 'm sure the department would . .

' We . can afford to find money to take care of veterans who ' are in need , : which ' is to carry out the real purpose of:this bill .
