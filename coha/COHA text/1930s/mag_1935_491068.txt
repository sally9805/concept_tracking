Iv P RETTY early in NRA two or three young politicians discovered the Little Fellow . Just what they meant by the Little Fellow they are coy about saying , but it is a juicy political mouthful , and even if they were a little hazy on economies and on the law they voted for and I swore to execute , they were certainly letter perfect and full to the lips of this kind of politics . Political critics of NRA and even some sincere doctrinaires of the old school are still convinced that the Codes hurt the Little Fellow in business . Before going into this , let me emphasize that the only Little-Fellow complaint of wide application of which I have any knowledge  --  and I have scanned them all with care  --  is that the Little Fellow does not want to pay Code wages for Code hours . But Code wages for Code hours are of the very essence of NRA . For example , a sweatshop simply could not exist if it paid Code wages for Code hours , or , if it paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as NRA is concerned , it had no choice in the matter . It was following language laid down by the President , of which the part pertinent is : " In my inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country . It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to workers has any right to continue in this country . By business ' I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry ; by ' workers ' I mean all workers , the white-collar class as well as the man in overalls ; and by ' living wages ' I mean more than a bare subsistence level ; I mean the wages of decent living . " Throughout industry , the change from starvation wages and starvation employment to living wages and sustained employment can , in large part , be made by an industrial covenant to which all employers shall subscribe . It is greatly to their interest to do this , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually means the opening up to industry of the richest market which the world has blown . It is the only way to utilize the so-called excess capacity of our industrial plants . This is the principle that makes this one of the most important laws that ever came from Congress . because , before the passage of this Act , no such industrial covenant was possible . " NRA carried out that policy as a sort of religion . If paying a minimum wage of twelve dollars is the oppression of small enterprise of which these men complain , I accept all blame . But the complainants never say that this is the protested oppression . They do not dare to say so . They advance a vague and tenuous generality  --  that the Little Fellow is being oppressed by " monopolistic tendencies " ? a subject fully covered in an earlier article . They do n't dare say that decent wages is the oppression , because to say that and act upon it would be to abolish the whole benefit to labor from NRA , and labor controls votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those complaints concern- 1 ing the small employer is neither difficult , nor obscure . It is simply as to the place of the greater amount of human suffering and oppression  --  an employer who chisels on the rule of minimum wages , or his workers . It is whether the small employer of five to thirty employees who complains now to these champions  --  and among these , not many but blatant , will be found the greatest chiselers under NRA  --  or his workers are the most to be pitied . The answer is that , in view of all that he can and sometimes has put in increased charges to the consumer  --  usually about double what NRA has really cost him  --  he is not in distress . We know that he used to say of his high prices , in 1916 , " It is the war . " Ho now says , " It is NRA . " We know of the leisure and laughter he has coined into greasy nickels . We know that , in spite of all this , he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he is now asked to pay wages high enough to allow his people to raise their heads in human decency ? If the answer is " he , " then these critics are correct and this law ought to be amended . But if the answer is that it is his workers who are to be considered , then these politicians should not prevail . To plumb the depths of feeling with which I approach this subject , one must consider the frightful results of depression on human labor that the great NRA goldfish bowl revealed  --  black men working in steaming lumber swamps for seven and five cents an hour , ten and even twelve hours a day . Children toiling in factories for very little more , ten hours a day , fifty-five hours a week , and sometimes on night shifts . Women in sweatshops and garret slums , bending , night . and day , over garments and pieces of garments , and not earning more than enough to buy food on a bare subsistence basis . From these right up to factories or stores on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , with wages equivalent to twenty cents an hour  --  it was this sort of thing that NRA set . out to correct . by an average forty-hour week with an average minimum twelve to . thirteen dollars per week . Even that is not the wage of decent living in by far the bulk of this country . But the cold truth is that the obligation to pay these minimum wages is 95 per cent of the Little-Fellow complaint . Who is the real Little Fellow  --  the black man in the swamp , the child in the factory , the woman in the sweatshop , or is it the small enterprise that says it can not exist in competition unless it practices those barbarisms ? Is the President right when he says that " no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to workers has any right to continue in this country , " or is my good friend Mark Sullivan right in predicting the disappearaneeof NRA , because he thinks that it would give more production at lower costs to let small factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that to do so would also take men off relief rolls at seven dollars a week ? I have never had the slightest doubt that the President was right , and , besides , Mark is wrong on another score  --  the Little Fellows hiring men at seven dollars a week would not bring in any added production or create any new employment . They would simply force Big Fellows to press down their wage scales . Purchasing power would be depressed proportionately . Production and employment would not he increased . They would he decreased , because the price of foods , other products not affected by NRA , and all such fixed charges as rents , rates and taxes would remain the same , but wages would be lower . The Real Question A S IS said in another article , this is all a question of balance and degree , but I am very sure that the majority of decent people in this country do not want their balance and degree set at any initial figure as low as Mark would have it  --  which just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt if there are many who would quarrel very much with the figure which was set by the President in PRA , and which was deliberately agreed to by more than 35 per cent of the employers who are subject to NRA . But apart from all this , it is a pity that we ca n't throw this Little-Fellow bunk out of the window and address the real question here squarely on its merits . There are two such questions : 1 . Shall we lower minimum wages and raise maximum hours under NRA in favor of small enterprise as such ? We have just talked about that , and I have had my say . My answer is no . I do not mean that there should not be greater flexibility in differentials , exceptions and modifications , but I do mean that 77777 On/ view/ nobody , big or little , has any right to engage in competitive business if his only method of doing so is to pay less than twelve dollars a week for forty hours of human labor . This is the vital question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of industrial competition . I am convinced that industry as a whole is ready to do that . 2 . Shall we abolish NRA and go back to hours and wages left to the vagaries of every economic wind that blows under unlimited competition ? Small Business Has a Voice T HIS second question reveals the deadliest danger of NRA  --  the theory that NRA and the Anti trust Acts under the Federal Trade Commission can exist side by side without composition of the philosophy of either . Mr. Richberg says they can . I say they can no more mix than can oil and water . It can no more be done than you can put two quarts of fluid into a one-quart - cup at the same time . This subject has been fully discussed in a previous article . But I must say here with all earnestness that unless this issue is bravely and unequivocally and finally resolved , we might as well abandon hope and scrap NRA outright . Mr. Richberg , as General Counsel , agreed with me as I understood him in all these principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommended to the President , before he went to Hawaii , the creation of the Industrial Committee of which he is the head , and his appointment to that position . In this capacity it was agreed between him and me that he would make it his chief duty during the President 's absence to try to work out with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice some reconciliation of conflicting aspects of policy in their and our views . He had been representing NRA on the Steel Code Authority , and had reported to me that we were rapidly approaching an ugly impasse . We had approved a Code for the iron-and-steel industry . Yet the Federal Trade Commission was busily engaged in preparation to go after them for doing things which , with Mr. Richherg 's legal approval and on my recommendation , the President had authorized in their Code of Fair Competi Lion . Unless I misread newspaper accounts of his recent utterances , Mr. Richberg has recently changed his mind . I think he says that he wants to return to the " competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his words can be so construed . Whether they were qualified when spoken or have been qualified since , I do not know , but I do know that worked out no composition with the Federal Trade Commission . The main purpose for which I suggested the Council , and him on it , seems not to have been achieved . No Little Fellow needs to fear the amendment of the Antitrust Acts contained in NRA . As Senator Wagner said in debate on NIRA , referring to the Codes : " It will be the first time that small business will have a voice in the government of industry . It has none today . " Industry has been given a right to act in unison , but only in close partnership with Government , and under governmental sanctions and supervisions , with Federal powers of control so direct , instantaneous and almost brutal as to make the ineffectual Antitrust Laws  --  which had so signally failed to protect against monopoly  --  seem mild by comparison . I admire the Federal Trade Commission , but at this crisis we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to take over NRA , it can only kill NIRA . That Commission was set up to do something similar to what NRA was set up to do  --  to improve our industrial condition by letting industry act in unison under the supervision of the Commission . But it was created against the background of a law saying to industry : " If you do act in unison , you will be hung , drawn and quartered . " Industry naturally asked : " What can we do ? " and the reply to that was , in effect : " The t. is a secret .. Ca , ahead and act . After you act , we will tell you whether you can do it or not . and if you have guessed wrong , the auto-da-f6 will commence . " Even the actual practice of asking what industry has done is an inquisitorial process , sometimes lasting a year , at great expense and continuous uncertainty . The net result is failure of original purpose , and , in my opinion at least , a negative cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ledger F LIAR from oppressing the Little Fellow , our rec- ords show that NRA has not only halted in its tracks a ten-year Sicilian Vespers which nearly wiped him out , but has squarely reversed it . When the Bituminous Coal Code went into effect. , 4500 small coal mines that we know of came hack into operation , and we know that thousands more of which we have no record have been restored . The Lumber Code brought hack 1500 small sawmills , and 2000 more have applied for allocation . The Retail and Wholesale Codes , by limiting the use of loss leaders and other devices of mass power of great corporations , saved literally tens of thousands of small merchants . The rubber-tire truce and Code arrested the impending destruction of the whole retail-tire business-60,000 to 70,000 small merchants . The Motion Picture Code gives the small independent . producer the first reasonable chance of survival and fair play that he has had in the past . ten years . We might go through the whole list of Codes with a similar conclusion . Indeed , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small enterprise . Far from impairing the chance of the Little Fellow . NRA is the greatest charter of economic salvation that small business ever had . Just as automatic machinery and labor-saving devices and great industrial combinations tend to wipe out individual enterprise , it may be that , in ( Continued on Pogo 80 ) the end , new mass methods of distribution will prevail , to the practical climina lion of small enterprise in merchandising . It may be that it is well to have mail-order houses and tilling stations run all lire dealers out , that chain stores should eliminate independents in every line . But this is no time to encourage or accelerate such disruptive change . The only way I have seen to deter this process is NRA . With 10,000,000 people unemployed and general commerce and industry barely recovered from the worst . mortality in history , this is no time to withdraw the actual and moral support of NRA from our convalescent structure . To the full extent . of the powers of NRA . we should maintain the status quo of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If existing tendencies are not checked and balanced , the time will come when we will have vast pauperism because there is nothing for a great group to do to earn a living . Yet , if I read current news aright , exactly this return to destruction of small enterprise is being invoked . That , principally , is why I think that NRA is being scuttled by its present controls . That is the essence of my disagreement with Donald Richberg . There are a few slight pegs  --  more apparent than real  --  on which the contrary argument may be hung : That the Code Authorities which administer the Codes are chosen from industry and that the Big Fellow may dominate them to the detriment of the Little Fellow ; that there are some Little Fellows who , for some particular reason , can actually pay Code wages and still undersell the Big Fellow ; that in causing everybody to report figures to Code Authorities , the Little Fellow has to reveal facts which enable the Big Fellow to get him . How Small Business is Protected But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , the argument halts and fails . They are apprehensions rather than events . In the first place , the Federal Government sits in the deliberations of the Code Authorities through a Government member who is charged specifically with the duty of seeing that monopolistic abuses or oppressions of Little Fellows do not happen . If they do happen , it is a failure of NRA administration , not a failure of NIRA or NRA policy . And there is an Industrial Appeals Board to which any injured man may go and get a hearing wholly independent of the Code Authority or of NRA itself . The fact is that there is almost no actual price fixing in NRA Codes , and in any Code where there is none , the argument falls because its premise of price fixing does not exist . Of course , the objection that Big Fellows see Little Fellows ' figures is superficial . There are no Codes without Little Fellow representation , and hence Little Fellows see Big Fellows ' figures too . There is another chance of abuse , especially in retail trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of unscrupulous competitors who use their position to exploit their fellows . This is an abuse . There is a local NRA director in every state , and it is his business to see that such abuses are corrected . It is true that there are regional differences in wages , long established , and these regional differences should be recognized . They have been recognized , although not perfectly composed ; but where , as in some districts , these old differentials were so great as to amount to exploitation of labor and invasion of the living standards of other areas , they ought not to be per-nutted to continue , and we did delib- , era tely attempt to root them out . The Sportsman 's Code for Industry My conception of NRA is perfectly illustrated by the Marquis of Queensberry rules in boxing . When this country was young , we used to have fights without . weapons . It was a perfectly legitimate riposte in the manly art , as then conceived , to insert . one 's thumb into the eye socket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouge his eyeball out ; or , if the occasion presented , you could put the point of your knee into his groin and rupture him , or by taking his ear firmly between your upper and lower incisors , neatly or otherwise , tear it off . Of course , by pickling your bare hands in brine or alum  --  there being no gloves  --  you could mar him for life almost any time you could connect . with his countenance . There you have rugged individualism to the ultimate . I can think of no better instance of it . But the mortality was heavy and there were too many human wrecks . Therefore , the Marquis of Queensberry and other boxing rules were established . I saw Max Baer , not long ago , bouncing Primo Camera around the ring . It did not appear that his rugged individualism was much Unpaired because he could not do any of those old and half-forgotten things . I doubt if anybody ever thought Jack Dempsey 's rugged individualism was hurt much when the Wild Bull of the Pampas knocked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull to the canvas four times in as many seconds  --  and he could n't even hit below the belt or indulge in the rabbit punch on the medulla oblongata of the Wild One . That is all there is to the Codes . They eliminate eye-gouging and groin-kneeing and ear-chewing in business . Above the belt any man can be just as rugged and just as individual as he pleases . All he has to do is to start from an even tau line , and then all the ? damage he can do his competitor by ability , aggressiveness , experience , wisdom and organization is perfectly legitimate . There is more chance for progress , more latitude for ability , more chanee for profit . and stability than ever before in our business history . There is undoubtedly an exhilarating sense of primitive freedom in having absolute license to range through the economic forest and plain , like a war party of the Iroquois , burning , killing , scalping and marauding  --  there is your true ruggedness  --  but we could not build the great industrial civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbo of forgotten romance . Both progress and recovery depend on a similar extermination in commerce . Since the beginning of time there has been a device of witch doctors . As Mr. Richberg once said , it is to set up a hobgoblin and then dance around the fire , beating the tom-tom and screaming at it . It awes the trusting natives , and nine times out of ten it does the trick of misleading people into prejudices against their own interests . There is no limit to which this trick may not go . The priests of Moloch even had the people sacrificing their babies on the red-hot hands of an idol . It is too late in the life of civilization to bring back the abominations of Assyria , but exactly the same sort of witch-doctoring is going on about NRA . Some say that no such action as Ntili was ever necessary ; that improvement would have come anyway ; that we should now abandon all Codes and go back to the old rule of hands off and let the best  --  or worst . man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in March , 1933 , were most eager for an outright dictatorship . " The devil was sick , The devil a monk would be ; The devil was well , The devil a monk was he . " The memories of these men are short . They were the very leaders of the 1922-1929 boom and bust , and it is this same discredited leadership that is now saying , " We are on our way out . The Recovery Program had nothing to do with it . Let 's abandon the whole thing and go back to the good old days . " Closing the Old Road This country does not want that  --  the sale of shady foreign and domestic securities under the appearance of stability of some of our greatest financial houses ; million-dollar bonuses in industry ; unchecked use of depositors ' money to support such Florida booms on the Stock Exchange as the 1929 fiasco ; a system of banking practices which can wreck the lifetime savings of practically a whole people ; abuses in our industrial system which can create the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than 13,000,000 breadwinners ; an economic and political system which for twelve years can witness the progressive degradation of agriculture to the point of absolute ruin and refuse even to consider an effective stop to the process ; a philosophy about extreme depression that the thing to do is nothing at all , but just to sit and take it while our economic structure rattles down about our ears and the beams of our political structure are already cracking . This country does n't want to go down to Endor and call up the black and hideous phantoms of March , 1933 , to come back and make their bed with us again  --  starvation , collapse and ruin . What is all this fantastic whirling against our own best interests ? It is the inability of a few people to make sacrifices at a desperate time and for the common good , and that is all it is . Military history has shown that battle is not the most effective test . of chivalry and manhood  --  a siege is . There is little excitement and less glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may share and live . Then petty , mean and .. cheating hoarding shows up , nerves that ; can not take it , hidden selfishness in figures hitherto covered with medals and shining repute , supplications for surrender  --  treachery , desertion and treason . Well , this is a siege , and in these few instances it is running trite to form . But these few instances are not even straws to show which way the wind blows with the brave mass of our people , who know that Franklin Roosevelt proposed a plan designed to help every depressed element of our population  --  industrial , agricultural , financial . They know that , though it creates mutual benefits , it also imposes mutual sacrifices ; that it can not art with equal speed in every part of this country or on every social segment ; that it averted disaster and chaos ; that it has brought hope , created confidence , lifted despair and improved the morale of the whole population . I never had any protest against criticism , and it is curious to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose it was because I answered it . But that , in my concept of how to do the job , I had to do . Nobody likes criticism , but any public institution is a peril if it is shielded from criticism ; however , there is no justification for a silent hauteur when the criticism is wrong . Controversy is the way to truth . There are some things in a great experimental program like this which are necessarily based on conjecture as to their effect , and the only possible way to gauge that effect is to watch its results in public reaction . Only if government remains fluid and flexible , and invites and acts instantly on criticism , is it possible to carry forward such a plan . NRA needed it , asked for it , could not have proceeded without it . A free and unrestricted press is an absolute necessity . It is a powerful , if independent , part of the machinery of government . The Controversy Criticism The first big criticism about NRA was that there was controversy there . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring or a courtroom because there is controversy there . The very Act was conceived in controversy  --  controversy as old as civilization  --  controversy among labor , management and consumers . For reasons recited earlier , we organized to make that controversy vocal , public and intense . We preferred to write the rules for a new economic government of the United States by hearing every side which might have an interest in the result and arriving by compromise at the greatest good to the greatest number and the least possible harm to anybody . I do n't know any other way to do it except to have an academic pundit go into some purple silence and emerge with directions to all business which he thinks will be good for it  --  like Moses From the Mountain of the Law  --  only Moses had the Lord God Almighty to tell him what to say , and I know of no human tieing with a brain capable of writing even ten inflexible rules for any business in this country . Of course there was controversy . The Advisory Boards were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were conducted to bring out every shade of opinion . The negotiations between management and labor were controversial . There was difference of opinion among my own stair , which also was set up to thresh conflicting views on the Government 's Part and policy in all this . The town rang with these arguments . But a new economic structure was being built and people were thinking of these problems as never before . The hammers rang , the riveters rattled , the saws screeched , but we built something that will , in part , at least , endure . And we did it without any furtive scheming , but in the full gaze of the whole country . I ca n't take this criticism seriously . Then it was said that we had no organization and wino we had was torn with bitterness and jealousy ; that I was a one-man operator and knew neither how to build an organization nor to act ? through one . Well , in the war this whole country was organized for the draft  --  every state , county , city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never heard either its organizational form or function criticized , and it turned out a fairly good job . I helped to reorganize the War Industries Board , the Division of Purchase , Storage and Traffic during the war , and several industrial companies after the war . What NRA Accomplished But let us stick to NRA . All it did was to organize 96 per cent of American commerce and industry subject to NIRA under codes in about a year . It organized the whole country for the PRA and Blue Eagle in four months , using a corps of tens of thousands of people to do it . It settled seven major labor disputes and sold the plan to the country in the meantime . If anybody thinks that could have been done other than organizationally or by any one man that ever lived , it is because he does not know this country , or the complexities of its business structure . As a matter of fact , very little of the accomplishment of NRA came over my desk . We started with nobody in the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . A more devoted , loyal and efficient group I never saw  --  and I have seen a good many organizations . A board of seven has been working for weeks and I have yet to hear of any improvements or change in organization or even of method in NRA that was not proposed before I left  --  although I must disclaim responsibility for anything that has happened in NRA since I left it .. I do not say the NRA organization was perfect , but I do say that it did its job in an organic method and achieved the end assigned to it . Most of the complaints of one-man operation came from one or two of those men in our own staff who wanted delegation of authority or an extension of confidence beyond the measure of their responsibility or ability . It was also said that there was confusion and delay , and people milling around the halls of the Commerce Building in haste , that I did not know what was going on , and comparisons were made between NRA and other departments of Goverument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Tombs are like that . /L is true that business descended on NRA faster than we could man the organization to handle it . it . is true that I could not get . space to house the people I had , and that made congestion . It is true that . many people came to Washington with ready-made Code provisions written in their own interest and expected to rush out with an NRA . signature on the dotted line without waiting for the other fellow to be heard from . These things made for delay , but it should not have been otherwise . There were also cases of culpable delay ? cases of cockiness by young 82 assistant , deputies ? not . many , but some . But we then had a rule that every written comm uniea lion must be answered , or at least acknowledged , within twenty-four hours . It is no longer true in the new period of deliberation . Every time I learned of unjustified delay , I corrected it . Looking back on the sum total of accomplishment , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delays . As to my not knowing what was going on  --  perhaps some people thought so , perhaps some still think so , but I had a succinct digest every day of every bit of NRA correspondence , and wherever I saw in that digest something that I thought I needed to see in full , I sent for it . Perhaps that may not give too much comfort to one or two Richelieus in and about NRA today , but it is a fact . As to congestion , I had foreseen that at the outset and arranged for one building large enough to accommodate NRA at its maximum size , and had even plotted the flow of work there . But some unseen hand reached out and frustrated that . From one month to another , the allegation was published that we had gone over to Labor , and then that we had gone over to Industry  --  in about equal doses symmetrically spaced . That is inevitable to an umpire . It was urged at first that we were going too slow , but toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially that nobody could render sane judgments who was whirling as rapidly as I in my own personal squirrel cage ; that I was overwrought ? " nerves atwitter " ? and even that I was drunk all the time . It is true that there were weeks on end when I averaged daily four hours ' sleep and eighteen hours ' work , and more weeks when I averaged six hours of sleep . But I then had the faculty of lying down and going instantly to sleep anywhere at any time for ten or fifteen minutes , and I did this frequently . Colonel Keller , at the Walter Reed Hospital , one of the world 's greatest surgeons , is also one of my best friends , and I went out there for a thorough going-over every three months , and until toward the very end there was not the slightest impairment of any function . In Defense of Hard Work The reasons I felt that I had to maintain the pace of work I practiced were , during the early months , first , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset , the whole thing would fail and , second , that we were keeping hundreds of business managers away from their work at great expense and just at the exact time when , above all else , business needed resident management and instant activation . The latter reason always remained . Some people felt that they could not possibly take the last word from anybody else , and though I deprecated this and avoided it as much as possible , it was sometimes necessary to see as many as 120 people in a day . Mr. Riehherg is recently quoted as saying that too much was attempted . He never voiced this hindsight criticism while the work was in progress . My reasons for what I did have been stated in a previous article . The myth about my not being able to make good judgments on account of exhaustion is just not true . They may not have been good judgments , and I am clearly convinced that many of them were not , but they were the kind of judgments I always make , and here EVENING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God save us  --  who insisted that I knock off work at five and also go on a long vacation , leaving my functions to a " deliberative " committee , always forget  --  I had been studying and planning and working on the fundamentals of NRA for nearly four years . I have been through two very similar experiences during the war  --  the draft and the War Industries Board . My work with Mr. Baruch had , taken me into the essentials of nearly every principal industry . I was a lawyer with an engineering education and an in tense business experience . I knew many , if not most , of the principal industrial leaders . I had helped put the pieces of the Recovery Act together and knew every line in it . I had personally planned the organization , method and regulations of NRA . And , as this record demonstrates , the fundamentals of what we were doing had been planned and studied with B. M. for many years  --  all of which was new to them . If such a word can be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apparently are , very far from that . The Barrage of Personalities Then came the assertions that I was dictatorial , bard-boiled , ruthless and opinionated . These , of course , are personal characteristics of which I am not qualified to speak . I only rejoice in the fact that , so far as I know , nobody has yet said that I was a liar , or a cheat , or a crook , or a grafter , or a political trimmer , or unfair , or disloyal  --  either to those working with me or above me  --  or a quitter , or a traitor to my Chief . As to the shorter , more robust and vulgar Saxon monosyllabic epithets , I am aware that I have garnered , per-Imps , the world 's choicest collection of these dead cats , but , since I confess to hurling quite a few myself , I feel even with the world on that . But all these were small-arms fire compared with the really heavy artillery  --  that we had bulldozed and domineered and regimented big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and promoted big business monopoly ; that we had rooked the consumer by permitting high prices ; that we had repressed the free upward movement of prices ; that we had withheld from labor the full benefits of Section 7-A and favored company unions ; that we had sold out to the American Federation of Labor ; that we had raised wages too high ; that we had kept wages too low ; that we had robbed the press of the constitutional guaranty of freedom ; and , worst of all , that we had operated to rob and prejudice the farmer . Some of these have been the subjects of particular articles or have been otherwise discussed herein . Here I want to touch lightly on others , and to take up the last one first . Right at the very outset , somebody in the Department of Agriculture  --  including AAA  --  began to spread through the Mississippi Valley the dogmatic assertion that NRA , by raising prices for things that farmers buy faster than farm prices were raised  --  principally on overalls and cotton gloves  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a distinct resistance to NRA in that area . I do n't know who did it , and I do n't want to know , but I know who did n't do it .. It was n't George Peek , who is an intimate friend of many years ' standing and who , if he wanted to have a light with me. would come right over to my office and have it  --  we 've had plenty . And it was n't FObruitury 9 . FUS5 Henry Wallace , for whom I have formed a warm attachment and who just does n't do things that way . And it was n't Rex Tugwell . Now , it was literally not true that NRA had lifted the prices of the things farmers buy faster or further than the prices of farmers ' sales had been lifted . In the first place , farm prices had been lifted further than those of any other group and the improvement in them , though by no means sufficient , is still greater than the improvement in the other group . In the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was caused in part by influences in the Recovery Program other than NRA . It will be recalled that the administration was extending all powers of government to lift all prices to the 1926 level , and the principal device at that time was the debasement of the currency . This worked pretty well on export farm products , where its effect is purely arithmetical . In the cotton-textile industry the price of raw cotton doubled  --  a pure farm-relief measure  --  the processing tax was another net addition to the cost of goods , and NRA increases in labor costs  --  which were disgracefully low before  --  all combined to increase the cost of manufactured goods 100 per cent . In short , the bulk of the increased cost of overalls and cotton gloves was due to farm-relief measures and not to NRA . But the propaganda in the Farm Belt was that it was all NRA . As to my own interest in agriculture and study of its problems , the following is an excerpt quotation of Henry Wallace 's New Frontiers , Page 145 : The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published under the title Equality for Agriculture . the names of the authors appeared as George N. Peek and Hugh S. Johnson . Eleven years later , George Peek , as administrator of AAA , was to help launch the first attempt to obtain fair exchange value for farmers , while his associate of 1922 , General Johnson , was directing another great recovery effort , the NRA ... . The idea of fair exchange value was finally approved , oven if all the Peek-Johnson plan was not . Propaganda Among the Farmers When it is said that NRA and the Blue Eagle have not done for the farmer all that he hoped , the answer is that NRA had no such protean duty . It was set up to do for city workers what AAA was charged with doing for farmers . But the wholly unjust propaganda against NRA going out to farmers from sources I have never clearly identified still continues . Even though NRA was designed particularly for urban workers , it had a great beneficial effect for farmers . Their greatest market is the domestic market .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippled countries to whom to loan millions in the hope that they will buy the products of our farms and factories , but we will never find a country with power to consume as much as 125,000,000 Americans within one tariff wall . If NRA has enriched that market , it has done well by farmers and deserves their best wishes and most enthusiastic support . By actual count it put ' , 785,000 city workers hack on pay rolls and added $3,000,000,000 to the purchasing power of the American domestic market in the year ended May thirty-first ; when propaganda was at its height , employment in this country had increased by 32 per cent , all pay rolls had increased by 28 per cent and pay rolls in menu-. facture  --  where NRA had the most direct effect  --  had increased by 57 per cent . During this same period , the cost of living increased only 11 per cent . Cold percentages do n't mean very much to one not accustomed to deal with them , but these figures simply say that , as to any group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra man has been added . They mean that , to every dollar of industrial workers ' power to buy farm products a year ago , more than fifty cents has been added . These increases are very great . They are among the most hopeful signs in the economic sky . NRA is not entitled to credit for all of this . But the President 's program as a whole is . Farm Purchasing Power What the President started out to do was to restore to agriculture its prewar purchasing power . In March , 1933 , the purchasing power of what farmers produce was just about 50 per cent of what it was in the prewar period , 1910-1914 . In other words , it took just twice as much farm produce to buy a plow or a binder or a peg-tooth harrow as it did before the war . Now , considering the seven basic crops as defined in the Adjustment Act , prices iu June , 1934 , were 4 per cent higher than prewar prices and the purchasing power of this group had advanced from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about 85 per cent of prewar purchasing power in June . In other words , the New Deal had achieved about 70 per cent of the gain necessary to restore prewar purchasing power to these crops . I want to make it clear that . I do not minimize the value of the effect of the check and balance of this sort of criticism . It is easily conceivable in any planned economy that one effort will outstrip the other . The farm criticism , when its basis is right , will be a wholesome check . We ca n't have a ruined agriculture and a prosperous industry any more than we can have a prosperous agriculture and a ruined industry . The President 's measures for industry have been effective to the extent just stated . His measures for farmers have been equally effective , but the industrial plans have done as much to help farmers as the Farm Plan , and the Farm Plan has done as much to help industry as has NRA . It is for this reason that enlightened self-interest should make farmers as stalwart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did not regiment or domineer business . There is not a Code or a Code provision in the whole category that was not agreed to by business . I proposed to let the licensing section of the law lapse because I did not want to maintain even that threat . All Codes were submitted voluntarily . I sometimes used every persuasion I could bring , and I am , unfortunately , tactless and vehement in argument , but while I have heard ex parte critics accuse me of bulldozing business , I never have heard of any Code committee saying this  --  not one single one . Of course the charge that wo sold out to big business or unduly favored It is the precise reverse of the charge of bulldozing it , and is equally untrue . There is no doubt that some deputies and assistants could never reconcile themselves to the labor provisions of the law and were not carrying them out in the spirit that animated them  --  not consciously , but because of long habits of thought . in a contrary direction . Whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign . On the other hand , we did not favor labor . Believing implicitly in their cause as defined in the Act , I nevertheless rapped them so hard when I thought they were wrong that it gave the enemies of NRA within the Government the opportunity they sought to stultify it . I rapped industry just as hard , and I conceived both rappings as duties . I would do the same thing over again . Mr. Richberg ruled , and I approved the ruling , pro tunic , that under the law , though an employer might legally make a closed-shop contract , yet when he came to enforce it by requiring a man to join this or that particular union not of his own choosing , the employer would be violating 7-A . This meant that majority representation could not be contracted for and executed as exclusive representation . I said that I did not regard a majority and a minority union in the same shop as practicable , but I still insisted that such was the law I had sworn to execute . But I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract to do an illegal thing is a good contract and , therefore , that the closed-shop contract on a majority vote was not a good contract . This was all very unpopular with labor , but it was the law . Mr. Garrison , former head of the National Labor Board , made it more unpopular by ruling to the contrary . In my opinion , under Executive Orders of the President , he had no power to overrule an NRA pronouncement on NIRA and the President 's own administrative interpretation of this Act and , whether he did or not , I have read his reasoning and it offers nothing of legal logic or statutory interpretation . It is not reasoning at all  --  it is an opinion that such a ruling is expedient . It refers to precedents which have no bearing because they antedate the statute , and it flies squarely into the teeth of the plain words of NIRA . Parallel Unions in One Plant I also agree that it was expedient and that the law should he amended , but I do not conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any right to change it . I am informed that Mr. Richberg has been able to make his own interpretation comport with the Garrison ruling , but I have not , as yet , been able to perform this extraordinary feat . A subsequent pronounce-merit by Mr. Richberg on this subject  --  three in all  --  makes what , to me , seems such a labyrinth of contradictions as I can not penetrate . Such is not the law , although I think with Mr. Garrison , that as a practical matter there can not be two parallel unions in one plant . I am very sure I know the answer to this serious impasse and that it is not the forcing of any academic view down any throat . This subject I shall later discuss fully . Other criticisms which I have collected for convenience earlier in this article could not be discussed here without repetition . But if these articles are to be of any value , justified criticism and acknowledged blunders should he just as freely confessed as unjustified criticism is answered here . I have really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I resent criticism , they forget that I invited a perfect round-up of criticisms last April and convened critics from all over the country to make them . They forget that every public hearing was a forum for criticism and that there were many of them every day . They forget that I held press conferences as often as necessary and never dodged a question , lied in an answer , or failed to encourage reporters not to pull their punches . Of course , this gave opportunity for criticism by everybody , and I had to take it as best . I could . I Dever had any fun at all myself . But now I am going to . I am going to criticize myself . Faults and Improvements In the April open forum I pointed out faults or indicated improvements in NRA , viz. : 1 . A more uniform and equitable rule of national price stabilization in those cases where it is necessary to maintain wages at a decent standard against the certain results of predatory and cutthroat competition , and further insurance against increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . A more effective rule on costs , for the purpose of maintaining rules against sales below costs of production . 3 . Uniformity of wages and hourly rates in competitive industries . 4 . Uniform classification of areas for the purpose of the North-South differentials. 5 . Further reductions in hours per week and further increase in hourly wages . 6 . Certainty of protection against monopoly control and oppression of small enterprise and , especially , the inclusion in codes of adequate buying-as well as selling-provisions , to guard against oppression of small business . 7 . A much improved method for securing prompt and effective compliance . 8 . A safe method of financing Code administration without racketeering and abuse . 9 . Elimination of inconsistent or conflicting provisions among various Codes . 10 . Adequate labor and consumer representation in an advisory capacity on Code Authorities . 11 . Uniformity of governmental representation on Code Authorities . 12 . Wider use of mechanism for settling labor disputes in connection with Code Administration . In addition to this , as I see my principal blunders , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , after I knew that NRA and PWA were not to move forward under a common coordination . 2 . I should not have had three Advisory Boards . I should have had an Advisory Council with three departments-one each for labor , industry and consumers . I corrected this before I left , but once a bureau , a board , or a commission digs in , it is not easy to root out . 3 . I should have insisted that the NRA Consumers ' Board be a department of a Consumers ' Council outside of NRA , with liaison to all administrations . 4 . I should have been less vehement in going after some small-fry critics ! only dignified them by answering at all . 5 . I should have insisted on my intended resignation in June and October , 1933 , and in April , June and August , 1934. 6 . I should have declined to postpone the organization of a compliance system and the new Blue Eagle drive , which I projected in April of 1934 , and which I delayed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 should not have temporized , for fear of hurt feelings , in securing the resignation of a few men whom Ieventually knew to be out of sympathy with the Recovery Act . 8. / should nover have acceded to the appointment of the Darrow Board . 9 . The Blue Eagle should never have been withdrawn in cases where the Department of Justice found no sufficient grounds for prosecution . 10 . Service industries-that is , industries which sell service rather than commodities-should not have been brought under Codes . They should have been given President 's agreements in local groupings when a large majority agreed . 11 . Small-town employers and small employers should never have been exempted from the Codes . Some system granting wider differentials should have been worked out , but nobody should have been totally exempt . 12 . NRA had a vital interest in proper mechanism for the settlement of labor disputes . I should have insisted on a National Labor Board impartial throughout in personnel and wholly independent of any department of government . 13 . The plan of rotating members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggressive Government member , with an assistant each for Labor and Consumers , should have been appointed to each Code Authority the moment the Code was approved , and he should have vigorously pressed its organization and administration in strict accordance with NRA policy . 15 . A clear-cut agreement on policy as between NRA , the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice should have been insisted upon at the very outset . 16 . I made the mistake of thinking that you can he frank and forthright in this kind of a job . My office door was always open to my own organization , and I had a rule that any member of my staff could sit in on any conversation . I could n't see everybody who wanted to see me , but I was willing to make a ppointments for anyone who had a real right to see me at any time I could , at any hour between ten A.M. one morning and two A.M. the next morning . The New System The present system of the new board seems much better adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of every working day to deliberate . During this period of silence there can be no interruptions , either by note or telephone , except from Mr. Riclahorg or the White House . They talk not at all . The Dalai Lama-the Living Bud ( lha-is not more closely sealed . They have profited from my errors and from what I went through ; they are right-only I could n't do the job that way if I had it to do again , and neither could they if they had the task of putting 96 per cent of industry under NIRA in four months and under Codes in a year . But the phase of Code making is past . This is a new phase of Code **25;700;TOOLONG of all my errors and completing the unfinished window in Aladdin 's palace . It should be done with deliberation , to the end that there shall be no more mistakes . It is , unfortunately , impossible to think that wo have found in this now board the hoped-for high Court of Commerce-a tribunal of older economic statesmen with the prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States has in Iowa place where , as a last resort , disconsolate industry , consumers or labor , EASE YOUR FEET ! You get relief one minute after ? where'er they languish , can bring their wounded hearts as to the Mercy Seat . There has just been brought to my attention the report of a President 's Committee on Economic Planning which criticizes NRA and asserts : 1 . That its leader was inept and opposed to economic planning ; 2 . That the Codes were hurried and inconsistent , and thus lacked perfection and had actually deterred economic planning ; 3 . That NRA has made no progress in working out wage differentials ; 4 . That NRA has left the wages-andhours pattern in worse condition than it found them ; 5 . That there is no proper co-ordination among Federal administrations which affect the economic pattern . All but one of the names attached to this broadside are unknown to me , as authorities or otherwise , and that one is not known to me as that of anybody qualified to speak on this subject .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to more consideration than such a proclamation as that of the Seven Tailors of Tooley Street , which began , " We the people of England ? " It is true that I was inept . It is not true that NRA opposed economic planning in the sense in which we understood it . On the contrary , NRA invented the only economic planning over put to actual test . It is true , in general , that the vexed question of wage differentials was not completely solved by the Codes , but they are so much further along than they were when we began that there is no just comparison . Many other questions were not satisfactorily resolved by the Codes . But I doubt if anything in this " report " is more critical of particular NRA shortcomings than are these articles . But when this so-called " report " proceeds through these specific statements to such general conclusions as that NRA obstructed economic planning and left the wages-and-hours pattern more confused than it fc  --  ind that pattern , it makes itself worthless . A Pattern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue in the face , but it was like planning a collision between Donati 's comet and the planet Uranus  --  there was no mechanism to make your plan effective . Faulty as the Code structure may be , feeble as it is rapidly becoming , it is still a keyboard upon which may be played such harmonies as a qualified performer may invent . There is , at last , a pattern in American industry which did not exist before , and the difference between the pre-NRA situation and the present one is about that between the cosmos " without form , and void ; and darkness upon the face of the deep " and , say , second day of the Creation , when there was at least light and a firmament dividing the waters from the waters . As to there being no improvement in the wages-and-hours structure , these critics have permitted their epithets to run away with their facts . The average work week before NRA was about fifty-two hours . But the extremes ran all the way from seventy-two to thirty-six . Under the Codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less than forty hours . With few exceptions the upper extreme is forty-eight . But the fact is that under NRA , industry has gone from a chaos of work weeks to an almost uniform forty hours . Generally speaking , the minimum wage is also standardized . If by " wage differentials " the committee means the pattern of wages above the minimum in any plant or industry , then the s nswer is that the law prescribed for NRA a fixation of minima only . If it means regional differences in wages , the answer is , as I have pointed out in these articles , that this subject is still far from a satisfactory solution , but as compared with the previous condition , the improvement has been very great .. As to the Codes having been arrived at by bargaining and with considerable variety of pattern , the implication apparently is that NRA should have created a. rule of planned economics and then rammed it down the throat of each industry in turn . Such was not the law , and any attempt to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject is fully discussed elsewhere in this series . AAA did try to do that , but it got no Codes . As the Doughty Dawes Said As to lack of co-ordination among administrations , I agree heartily with everything except the remedy proposed  --  another pale pink committee . I have said so much on this subject that repetition would just be regurgitation . Perhaps I should not attempt to answer these academic musings , but when they come embalmed in the amber of such a title as Report of the President 's Committee on Economic Planning , the title page compels attention , even if all the other pages might better be ignored . Nobody is going to kill the good in NRA . During the next few months it should learn what is bad and rub that out , what should be strengthened and strengthen it . And this greatest economic experiment in the history of the world will leave its legacy of proved benefit in the happier future of our business life for many years to come . To those in Government who may have been alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I commend once more the thought that here you have millions of people affected by NRA , but the kicks are from less than 1 per cent of the potential kickers . And to my belabored ex-associates let me quote the great T. R. : " It . is not the critic that counts ; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better . The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the Arena , whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood ; who strives valiantly ; who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming ; but who does actually strive to do the deed ; who knows the great enthusiasm , the great devotion ; who spends himself in a worthy cause , who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement , and who at the worst , if he fails while daring greatly , knows that his place shall never be with those cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And anyway , as the doughty Dawes observed , when the bear-baiting Graham Committee tried ineffectually to draw him into political criticism or the conduct of the war : " Holl'n ' Maria ! We did the job , didn't. we ? "
