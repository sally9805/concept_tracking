In February 1936 the U. S. Supreme Court upheld the death sentence conviction of a smalltime crook named Gooch for the abduction of two sheriffs from Paris , Tex . to Pushmataha County , Ark . Kidnapper Gooch and a pal did what they did to thwart arrest for a series of robberies . In a scuffle preceding the abduction one of the sheriffs was injured in the leg , thus enabling the jury at Gooch 's trial to recommend the death penalty under the Lindbergh Law . Gooch was executed . <P> Potency of the Lindbergh Law depends on Congress ' power to regulate interstate commerce , interpretations of which have been so notoriously contradictory . Currently in the Illinois Law Review a smart young Louisiana State University law professor named Thomas A. Cowan licks his legal chops in a fancifully-written article which shows just how loose has been the courts ' usage of this Constututional phrase , " commerce . . . among the several States . " Crux of Lawyer Cowan 's thesis is that the U. S. Supreme Court has been willing to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves " morals , " * but has narrowly circumscribed Congress ' power where business and industry were concerned . With many an obscure legal phrase and many a learned footnote , Lawyer Cowan pokes fun at legalists as only another legalist can . He sets forth how , in an " exhaustive and painstaking opinion , " a learned jurist whom he calls Alyce has settled once &; for all the subject matter of " interstate commerce . " <P> The hypothetical case which Justice Alyce decides , modeled after the facts of the Gooch case , is called Ex parte Snatch . Oscar Snatch , a candidate for the senior class presidency of Siwash College , situated ten miles from a State line , kidnapped his rival , one Jeremiah Kelly , held him for seven days prior to the election . According to Candidate Snatch 's story at his trial , after being indicted under the Lindbergh Law , he seized Candidate Kelly , bundled him into a darkened automobile and drove toward the State line but did not cross it . In the preliminary scuffle Jeremiah Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . Oscar Snatch was convicted on the ground that he had kidnapped his rival for " ransom or reward or otherwise . " Since the victim was missing seven days , the law presumed he had been transported in interstate commerce . The jury chose to believe a State line had been crossed , recommended the death penalty because Candidate Kelly had not been released unharmed . <P> In his opinion denying Snatch 's appeal , Justice Alyce says : " Unquestionably Snatch has been engaged in commerce , for no one can deny that he has done something . And precedent is abundant that doing anything is commerce . Thus , cows ranging back and forth over State lines because their owners have neglected to fence them in are engaged in commerce ( Thornton v. U. S. ) . . . . However , Snatch is technical . He says that commerce has to do with trade , business , commercial enterprise , adventure involving profit or loss . . . .                  @ @ @
