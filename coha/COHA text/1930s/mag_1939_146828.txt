Last week observers had difficulty recognizing the Queen Mary , though Britain 's big luxury liner lay in plain sight next the Normandie at her dock in Manhattan 's North River . Her superstructure , more spotlessly white than ever , seemed to be suspended over a smudgy grey cloud that blended with wharves and water . The lower part of the ship had all but disappeared under a coat of grey paint . Day or two later the white superstructure almost disappeared too . The Queen Mary was not slapping on war paint ( battleship grey is several tones bluer and less muddy ) but was introducing the latest style in camouflage , a solid , sooty , flat grey . <P> Camouflage in the last war meant whirls , blotches , stripes and curlycues with which " experts " made common objects look like a futurist 's bad dream . Stripes and blotches were supposed to do for ships and tanks what stripes and blotches are supposed to do for giraffes and tigers . Camouflage artists called the effect " disruptive coloration . " At sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil U-boats ' calculations of its speed and course , make torpedoes miss their mark . Opponents of dazzle long insisted that camouflage should conceal as well as confuse , and since World War I they have waged their own quiet war against disruptive camouflage . When the Aquitania , also painted a solid , muddy grey , slipped into her berth near the Queen Mary last week , it looked as if British anti-dazzlers had won . <P> What U. S. ships , would look like if war came is still a deep defense secret . But outspoken army camoufleurs turn thumbs down on dazzle . Their problem , they feel , is harder than outsmarting a periscope running ten to twelve feet above heaving wave-levels . They have to conceal parked tanks , trucks , grounded planes , big guns from modern aerial camera-eyes which can even pick out the curl of withered camouflage leaves from 3,000 feet in the air . <P> Down in Virginia 's cedar-dotted Fort Belvoir , where the U. S. Army runs its only experimental camouflage laboratory , camoufleurs study how to outwit stereopticon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve such apparently insoluble problems as what to do when tanks are concealed in deep shadow and the sun goes behind a cloud ; how to camouflage a truck , when an aerial camera can pick up a tireprint on the grass " almost from the stratosphere . " They also experiment with dazzle v. solid color camouflage . <P> One result of their tests has been to replace old-style burlap and fishnet " flattops " for concealing big guns and trucks with new style drapes made of visinet , a light , durable paper compound . Fort Belvoir camoufleurs " dazzled " visinet drapes with green blotches to resemble vegetation , burnt sienna blotches to blend with Virginia clay soil . Solid color drapes they painted with a mixture of blue , yellow and red oil paints , producing a somewhat greener green than the usual olive drab of U. S. Army trucks . For solid brown drapes they mixed flat burnt umber and yellow ochre coldwater paints , made drapes look like big chocolate bars .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
