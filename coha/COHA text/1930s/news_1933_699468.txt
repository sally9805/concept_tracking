txt Mayor O'Brien moved last night to block passage of the bankruptcy and currency bill now pending in the House of Representatives on the ground that it would reduce the value of city tax liens on real estate if passed . Carrying his economy program into another phase , the Mayor directed the Municipal Civil Service Commission to hold no examinations other than those for promotion until further orders had been received from the Mayor 's office . He ordered that he be consulted on the necessity for any proposed examination before it was held . Encouraged by reports that the Education Department had reduced its budget for other than personal service by $2,600,000 , and that the Police Departm-nt had slashed its expenses an additional $80,000 , the Mayor said prospects were bright for the realization of a second $20 , - 000,000 saving . Department heads were busy yesterday pruning their expenses in response to the Mayor 's final appeal for economy , which set tomorrow noon as the deadline . The Mayor reiterated his promise to make the cuts himself If his subordinates fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House bill as one filled with " momentous " consequences to the city if passed . He has talked the bill over with Representative Thomas Cullen and said he would telegraph Senators Royal S. Copeland and Robert F. Wagner , asking them to oppose it in the Senate . A debate on the measure is scheduled for Monday . In declaring his administration 's opposition , the Mayor said : " I have suggested to the New York delegation in Congress to request the recommitment to the Bankruptcy and Currency Committee of bill H. R. 4,359 , now pending before the House of Representatives , the avowed object of which is to amend the bankruptcy act to facilitate readjustment of indebtedness of individuals , corporations and railroads in financial difficulties by proceedings which would avoid bankruptcy . " A scrutiny of the bill disclosed that it not only reaffirms the power of the Bankruptcy Court to sell real estate of bankrupts , free from liens of city and State taxes , but it also extends the power of those courts to reduce or trar.sfer the liens into security of doubtful value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To aggravate the situation , while the present law applies to actual bankrupts who are insolvent , the proposed bill applies to corporations which are insolvent or are unable to pay their debts even though solvent . " The real object of the bill is to declare a moratorium in favor of certain groups of individuals and corporations . " Any attempt to tamper with city liens on real estate is not only prejudicial to the financial security of the city but is an unjust , unfair and dishonest burden on taxpayers who do not avail themselves of the privilege of the moratorium created by the bill . Those taking the benefit. , of the moratorium enjoy equally with those not so availing themselves of all police , fire , sanitary , garbage disposal , water and other facilities offered by the city to property owners . ' While I feel the greatest sympathy for ... he farmer , the small ' trader or private corporation over whelmed by financial disaster and believe that every encouragement should be extended to them , yet I deem it a shock to confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of corporations whose securities are widely scattered , and which securities were purchased by the public in good faith . " Having unloaded these securities upon the public at inflated values , for many millions of dollars , these corporatiom are now given opportunity to revise downward and to readjust the securities by reducing or totally wiping out many of their issues . Duty to Taxpayers Seen . " Be that as it may , the City of New York owes a duty to taxpayers to prevent the use of bankruptcy statutes of this proposed bill from adding additional burdens to the taxpayers and depriving the City of New York of millions of dollars of taxes . " The City of New York will oppose to the limit any attempt to tamper or Interfere with the city 's tax liens on real estate . " Mayor O'Brien issued his ban on civil service examinations in a letter to Abraham Kaplan , president of the Municipal Civil Service Commission . The letter read : " All possible economies should be effected in your department . Until further directions from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion or absolutely essential examinations . As to all of the examinations referred to in these exceptions , consult with me before taking any action .
