Immutable privilege of dictators , within their borders , is that of changing past and current history to suit themselves . Last week in Rome , Fascist Italy celebrated an " Italo-Spanish solidarity day " to whip up enthusiasm for the Spanish Rightist cause . Presence of Italian " volunteers ' " with scarred faces , empty sleeves , lost legs , lucidly illustrated Italy 's participation in the war . Representing Generalissimo Franco was one-eyed , one-armed General Jose Millan Astray , founder 3 of Spain 's Foreign Legion . <P> Total Italian casualties in Spain were modestly placed by the Fascist press at 2,023 killed , 6,996 wounded , 359 captured by Leftists . More indicative of Dictator Mussolini 's power was his new interpretation of what happened in the famed Guadalajara battle of March 1937 , between Italians and Spanish Leftists . Described by U. S. and British newshawks on the scene as a panicky rout for the Italians , it now appears in Italy 's press as one of the country 's five " great victories " of the Spanish Civil War. * <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
