txt Platforms and Promises To the Editor of The New York Times : It will be an important duty of voters at the November election to rebuke repudiation of party pledges . President Roosevelt was elected on a sound platform . He accepted it 100 per cent and repeatedly gave assurance that he would dedicate himself to its fulfillment . Once in office he forced adoption of measures which were irreconcilable with that platform and had never been approved by the electorate . Some of the worst of them have been voided as unconstitutional . However , far from offering valid excuse for radical departure from the platform of 1932 and traditional American policies , or being chastened by legal reproof , the administration 's attitude *offers evidence of intention , either by indirection or subterfuge , to reimpose its radical legislation and decrees . What becomes of our American democracy when the sanctity of party platforms , personal pledges and official oaths is lost ? P. H. New York , April 3 , 1936.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
