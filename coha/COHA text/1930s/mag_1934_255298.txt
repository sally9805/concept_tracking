Last year national advertisers paid $145,000,000 to U. S. newspapers , because a news-thirsty public bought 35,175,000 newspapers every day . Last year national advertisers paid $49,500,000 to radio broadcasters because 18,500,000 households listen to Radio 's music , patter and melodrama every day . If Radio also broadcast complete news , many a listener would not bother with newspapers . <P> Therein lies the prime reason for a chronic warfare between Press and Radio , which for eight months has been held within bounds only by an armed truce . <P> Last week in Manhattan the old battle seemed about to break into fresh fireworks . Station WOR ( Macy 's and Bambergers department stores ) proposed to fill the air with an hour 's news every day . News on the Air , For a time Radio helped itself to the columns of newspapers . When the Press protested such flagrant thieving , an arrangement was made whereby Radio was supplied with reports from Associated Press , United Press and International News Service , to be broadcast with full credit . The front remained reasonably quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped the Press with the latter 's own costly reports of the ballot counting . The Press rose up angrily and vowed never again to hand its precious stock-in-trade over to its most dangerous competitor . Columbia Broadcasting System organized its own newsgathering service , proceeded to sell a news program to commercial sponsors . <P> The Press threatened to throw all CBS program announcements out of the newspapers , hinted darkly at a newspaper lobby potent enough to put Radio under stricter government control .

Press-Radio Bureau , maintained by the major news services and the broadcasting chains , prepares two daily five-minute broadcasts of news from AP , UP and INS . Also it is supposed to release flashes of " transcendental " importance as they occur . <P> About 215 stations use this sanctified service , but many an independent wants more . Their rebellion this year bred a rash of news agencies , designed to furnish broadcasters with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which soon vanished . By last week the most important left in the field was Transradio Press Service . <P> Transradio Press Service . If UP 's Karl Bickel or AP 's Kent Cooper should walk into the Transradio office in Manhattan , he could plant himself in the news editor 's chair , roll up his sleeves and run the show with practically no coaching . With its news editors , rewrite men and teletype operators , the place looks , sounds , smells and works like a wire service office in any U. S. city . But there is an invisible difference : The teletyped news reports flash cross-country not into newspaper offices but into 50 broadcasting stations .
