( See front cover ) <P> Though no committee of Congress had yet begun hearings on it , the great debate on President Roosevelt 's proposals to reform the Judiciary and , incidentally , to alter the Supreme Court , last week burst prematurely open in full Senate . First Tennessee 's windy McKellar , then Arizona 's courtly Ashurst , with interpolations by thunderous Majority Leader Robinson , shook the air with preliminary salvos . Reason : even before the historic Supreme Court Battle of 1937 began , the Administration was losing ground . <P> " Oh Kaaay . " Senator Ashurst , the soul of oldtime gallantry , would hardly be so rude as to argue against a lady , but it so happened that the arguments he rose to refute were last week most strikingly expressed by a woman . Columnist Dorothy Thompson ( whose husband , Sinclair Lewis , wrote It Ca n't Happen Here ) wrote : <P> " No people ever recognize their Dictator in advance . He never stands for election on the platform of dictatorship . . . . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet that our dictator , God help us ! will be a great democrat , through whose leadership alone democracy can be realized . And nobody will ever say ' Help to him or ' Ave Caesar ' nor will they call him ' Fhrer ' or ' Duce . ' But they will greet him with one great big , universal , democratic , sheeplike blat of ' O. K. , Chief ! Fix it like you wan na , Chief ! Oh Kaaay ! ' " <P> Others put the argument in different fashion . Explaining his position to the Indiana General Assembly , Representative Samuel B. Pettengill of South Bend , wrote : " A packed jury , a packed Court and a stacked deck of cards are on the same moral plane . ... It is more power than a good man should want or a bad man should have . " <P> In a national broadcast Senator Burton K. Wheeler cried : " Every labor leader , every farmer and every progressive-minded citizen in the United States would have been shocked and protested from the housetops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even intimated that they wanted to increase the Supreme Court so as to make it subservient to their wishes . The progressives would have said , and rightly so , that it was fundamentally unsound , morally wrong and an attempt to set up a dictatorship in this country . " <P> " I Marvel . " When Senator Ashurst rose last week in the Senate , he was interrupted by Senator Bailey of North Carolina who asked whether Mr. Ashurst did not say after the Supreme Court 's NIRA decision that among the " unjust criticisms " leveled at the President was the charge that he intended to enlarge the Court . Senator Ashurst at that time said : " A more ridiculous , absurd and unjust criticism of a President was never made . No person whose opinion is respected has favored attempting such a reckless theory and policy . " <P> Unabashed , Mr. Ashurst now replied : " It is obvious from the record that that is my utterance . The rhetoric alone carries its proof . . . . The man who attempts to be consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never accomplish anything else . "
