Strikebreaking Incorporated Condensed from Harper 's Magazine Edward Levinson When a manufacturer determines to break a strike among his employes , he does not simply hang out a " Men Wanted " sign and proceed to hire new men . On the contrary , he telegraphs a strikebreaking agency - if , indeed , salesmen for these firms have not been on his doorstep for many days . Strikebreaking Incorporated is often a bloody and murderous business , and it is manned by as choice an army of thugs and mercenaries as you would care to meet ; but it is highly profitable . It exists in no other country in the world except the United States . Today the best known , though no longer the most extensive , of the strikebreaking agencies is that operated by a gentleman named Pearl L. Bergoff , * the " Red Demon , " whose methods illustrate the technique of the profession . The Red Demon divides his men into three principal departments : the " Undercover Department - male and female mechanics and workpeople . . . to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow employes ; Openshop Department  --  to keep the wheels of industry moving during a strike ; Protection Department - composed of big disciplined men . . . for the protection of life and property . " Within the profession less formal descriptions are used . The men hired to keep the wheels of industry moving are " finks " - an underworld term for one who betrays his fellow workers for money ; the guards are " nobles " or " captains , " while the spies are " boats . " The nobles , most of whom are gangsters , act as overseers of the finks , as well as guards . Finks are frequently unreliable . They are divided into two large classes . About half of them are the " hunger scabs " - unemployed men who take the work in desperation . To the profession they are " onetime finks " who sign up for one strike and are never seen again . The other half of the finks are shiftless men ; or criminal types - from petty thieves to larcenists and murderers - to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finks have stolen everything from plumbing fixtures to $50,00o worth of furs - made off with in a team-  | sters ' strike . But the dishonesty of the fink never has such free play as in trolley strikes . A trolley car to a fink crew is a letter of marque to steal the fares , shortchange the passengers , and operate the car on whichever street pays best . The loot does not belong to the finks alone . During every hour of a strike the nobles collect their tribute . The opportunity to fleece the finks is part of the price an agency has to pay for the services of gangsters to whom the pay of a noble would be paltry . The finks are herded together , virtual prisoners in their barracks . They may not venture out for cigarettes , drinks , or amusements of any kind , lest they fall into the hands of strikers . To fill their needs the captains step forward . For a pastime they provide gambling . Bring 10 finks together and automatically a pair of dice will begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles , and are usually loaded . Next to the crap game , the most lucrative of the concessions is that which goes to the " crumb-boss , " who will guarantee the hard-pressed fink a place to rest his head upon payment of 25 or 5o cents a day . He will always manage to have 10 or 15 fewer cots than are needed , so that the danger of sleeping on the ground is made a real one . A fink may sometimes avoid the crap game , but he can not escape the crumb-boss . Nor can he escape the nobles who have been assigned the overlordship of the messroom . Each takes his fee . Another potentate sets up a **25;0;TOOLONG on the premises and by virtue of his monopoly charges twice the normal price of his commodity . The functions of strikebreakers do not include the operation of factories or traction systems left idle by the strikers . Strikebreaking is rather , in the case of finks , a matter of putting up a show of activity and thus destroying the morale of the strikers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles will strike terror into the hearts of the strikers or precipitate violence which will bring public opinion , and perhaps the police or military , behind a move to end the walkout . If the record of fatalities in nine major strikes which Bergoff tried to break were reduced to boxscore simplicity , the table would show : Strikers killed by strikebreakers , 17 ; strikebreakers killed by strikers , 6 ; men , women , and children killed by strikebreaker-driven cars , 21 ; bystanderkilled bystrikebreaker , r ; strikebreakers killed at work , 3 ; strikebreakers killed by strikebreakers in barracks , 4 . The field for professional strikebreaking is wide . There is not a large city in the country where private detective agencies will not be glad to furnish informers , finks ,  | and nobles . There are 55 licensed detective agencies in New York that make urgent solicitation for strikebreaking work : and half a dozen of them have had violent careers . The Sherman Corporation , which exploits the newest specialty of the strikebreaker , called " Strike Prevention , " explains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out to the workers what the teaching of the radical agitator , bolshevik , socialist , or whatever you want to call them , will bring them to . The Pinkertons ' National Detective Agency , Inc. , has offices in every large city , and yields to none its claim to be the most effective spy bureau in the land . The William J. Burns International Detective Agency has offices , with special industrial and radical departments , in 32 cities . Harry S. Mousley , " principal " of the Aetna Judicial Service , of New York , writes : We have facilities to collect various data for you through circuitous methods of operation . In simple terms , we secretly install undercover operatives in the factory . . . . Ostensibly they are fellow workmen to those under observation ; mechanics , laborers , doing whatever work will give them the best opportunities to gather facts . ' But the future of strikebreaking belongs to the Railway Audit and Inspection Company - the " R. A. and I. , " of which finks and nobles throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Auditing - Engineering - Inspection , " is of and by Wall Street - said to have sprung from the loins of Brown Brothers , bankers - and is far more varied in its endeavors than either the I3urnses or Pinkertons . For all its 26 years of existence , the R. A. and I. remains something of a mystery , with almost a score of affiliates making identification difficult . But it provides the most thorough strikebreaking system in the country , from spies and strikebreakers to tear-gas bombs and Thompson submachine guns . It covers its espionage work with the labels " human engineering " and " educational work . " It has served the New Orleans , Dayton , Buffalo , and Olean , N. Y. , street car interests ; Firestone Tire and Rubber , Brooklyn F'dison , Pennsylvania Coal and Iron , Bush Terminal , General Motors , LT . S. Steel , and H. C. Frick companies . The outstanding F. A. and I. affiliate is the Federal Laboratories , Inc. , munitions sellers , whose activities in Cuban and South American politics so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munitions trade in 1934 . Corporations in several cities may hire strikebreakers and buy ammunition  | from the same agent acting for the R. A. and I. and the Federal Laboratories , Inc . The Laboratories sold $30,000 worth of tear gas in San Francisco during the 1934 strike . Labor disturbances in Pittsburgh in 1934 gave the company $75,00o worth of business . Despite the nurturing of professional strikebreaking to the proportions of a major industry , it is doubtful whether American industry has ever made a worse investment . It is an axiom of the profession that no matter which side loses a strike , the strikebreaking agency always wins . Reasonable employers who are prone to compromise , and unions too conservative to strike , both enjoy the fullest contempt of the strikebreaking organizations . The industry grows rich on mistrust and conflict . It is an amazing thing that sober , hardheaded American business men will pay good money for the reports of spies and , more unbelievable , that they place credence in them . Men who are willing to act as informers are usually of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will invent it . Agencies have been known to tell their operatives to " make the reports rawer . " In many cases the reports of the undercover men are imaginatively rewritten in the offices of the agencies . At best , there is nothing in the report of a labor spy which an employer could not learn from a frank discussion with representatives of his employes . The reliability of the strikebreakers , as distinguished from informers , is even more questionable . The president of a large Eastern transit company declares that " strikebreakers do nothing to prevent a threatening strike , nor to help end one once it has started . " The basic cause of strikes is still labor 's demand for a fuller share of its product . But it seems beyond dispute that in the adjustment of these demands no sorrier and more futile method than the use of spies and strikebreakers can be imagined . Nevertheless , Strikebreaking Incorporated faces the future with every prospect of business as usual . During 1934 , 42 men and women were killed in strikes . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of strikebreakers . The introduction of strikebreakers brought martial law to Omaha and to Terre Haute . Strikebreaking Incorporated feels secure , not only because of the continuous demand for its services , but also because of the extent to which it enjoys freedom at the hands of the law . No factor in industrial life has been so completely denounced by official investigating bodies arid so completely untouched by restricting legislation . Only one state , Wis-  | cousin , requires that the names of industrial spies be registered with the public authorities . There has been no thought to curtail the employment of finks . Such a step would interfere with the rock-rooted right of a man to seek employment wherever and whenever he pleases , and the courts have therefore ruled that strikebreakers must have the full- est protection the police power and the military can give them . Yet as long as men are sent to take the jobs of others and break strikes there will be disorder and frequently violence . The problem of legal correctives belongs to those who believe that the conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing the nation 's needs .
