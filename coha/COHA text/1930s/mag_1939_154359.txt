First time KMOX ( St. Louis ) invited bald , elderly Rev. Louis Sieck of the Zion Lutheran Church to its Church of the Air pulpit , studio technicians schooled him thoroughly in the ticklish trick of winding up his sermon on the dot . Recently the Rev. Mr. Sieck was invited to KMOX again . This time he knew all the answers . Glancing over his spectacles now and then at the big studio clock as he rolled off his message . Parson Sieck was pleased to fancy that he and the big second hand were finishing in an expert dead heat . " Glory to God in the highest , " he intoned , " Amen . " <P> " Well boys , " he crowed , " we hit it right on the nose . " Actually Parson Sieck had fallen short of the nose by some two seconds , and his last remark hit pious radio listeners right in the eardrums.
