On Christmas 1888 at Arles in Southern France a young painter with a hooked nose called at the house of his best friend . Police and neighbors , all shouting excitedly , stood before the yellow door . Up rushed the red-faced chief of police . <P> " What have you done to your friend ? " he yelled . " Yes , you know well enough . He 's dead ! " <P> Under a sheet upstairs lay the bloody body of Vincent van Gogh minus one ear . Artist van Gogh was not dead but in a cataleptic trance . He had cut off his own ear by way of self-punishment . Paul Gauguin had had nothing to do with it beyond the fact that he had spent Christmas Eve in his friend 's company . The two lived to rank among the greatest of French modernists . Both were mouse-poor and half-insane when they died . Both have been made the protagonists of best-selling novels. * Last week Manhattan 's Wildenstein Galleries did its best to give Paul Gauguin a memorial show to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) . <P> As an example of exhibition building , the Gauguin show is even better than the van Gogh show . Forty-nine canvases from 25 different collections give the whole story of Gauguin 's artistic development , from his pseudo-Monet landscapes of Brittany , done in the 1870 's , through the brilliant stalwart nudes of Tahiti , for which the world remembers him , to the nostalgic view of France , painted in the Marquesas in the last years of his life when his eyesight was nearly gone and his feet were rotting away with chronic eczema . <P> Besides the pictures the show contains an elaborate reliquary . In it are original letters , books from Gauguin 's lean library , tattered scrapbooks dedicated to his daughter Aline and a facsimile of the manuscript of his autobiography , Noa Noa , decorated with 40 pages of water colors and wood engravings in his own hand . <P> The basic difference between the painting of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin is that Artist van Gogh strove to put on canvas the rocketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas Gauguin , whose head throbbed with the same painful lunacy , sought to escape from it in his work . His best pictures have the dark rich colors of Persian rugs . They are as carefully composed as Chinese paintings . Despite the difficulty of obtaining raw materials in the South Seas , he produced more pictures than van Gogh . Many of Gauguin 's later pictures were done on prepared flour bags . <P> Typical of his best work were at least two pictures on exhibition last week : The White Horse , loaned by the Louvre , which shows a long-maned white horse drinking peacefully in a stream while in the background a nude Tahitian girl rides another horse back from the stream to the pasture , and The Call , now the property of Wildenstein &; Co. in which three half-clad Tahitians stroll under slender trees against a dark tropical landscape . <P> Contrary to popular opinion , Paul Gauguin was not the first crack artist to paint Tahiti . That distinction belongs to the father of U. S. mural painting , John La Farge. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants and a mass of pictures , but he lacked color for the general public .
