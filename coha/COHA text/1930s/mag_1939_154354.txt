For several years J. P. Morgan has been quietly liquidating his directorships , cutting the corporate list to four : U. S. Steel , Pullman . Discount Corp. , and Aetna Insurance Co. of Hartford ( a fire company ) . Last week Mr. Morgan resigned from Aetna , which has had a Morgan on its board ever since his great grandfather helped to found it in 1819 . The trips to Hartford were a little too much for aging J. P. Morgan , 71 last September .
