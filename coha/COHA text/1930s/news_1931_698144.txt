txt Great Britain balanced her budget today by converting the estimated deficit for the current fiscal year of $373,395,000 into a surplus of $7,605,000 and changing the estimated deficit for the year ' 1932-33 of $850,000,000 into a surplus of $7,500,000. - The fear , was accomplished partly by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden in a supplementary budget providing for new taxation and partly by economies the new government is going to put into effect by the emergency method of orders in council which will obviate the long delays of the usual Parliamentary methods . The increases in direct and indirect taxation for the current year , which ends March 31 , will provide $202,500 , - 000 in new revenue and $407,500,000 for the full year 1932-33 . The greater part of these additions are the result of increases in the income tax . The basic standard rate has been raised to 25 per cent  --  that is , from $1.12 on $5 to $1.25 on $5 . The surtax rate has been increased by 10 per cent in all brackets and . the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? comes and decreasing the various exemptions . As a result of these changes the Exchequer will derive in the next six months an added $145,000,000 from the income tax , and the increase for the next full year is estimated at $287,500,000 . Other Levies Increased . Other increases in revenue will come from an added levy on beer , tobacco and gasoline and a new entertainment tax . Beer will cost cents more a pint , tobacco a cent more an ounce and gasoline 4 cents more a gallon . The tax on all forms of entertainment is increased to 16 2-3 per cent . The estimated additional ' income from these increases this year is $57,500,000 and for the next year $120,000,000 . Also a saving on the debt amortization of $68,500,000 is provided for this year and $100,000 , - 000 next year . On the score of economies in expenditures on the country 's social services , government salaries and in. the army , navy and air forces , the total savings for the remainder of this year will be $110,000,000 and for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be on the unemployment insurance item , on which the recent Labor Government went to smash , and a category on which it was insisted that drastic cuts be made as the only means of restoring the confidence of foreign countries in British financial soundness . By means of a 10 per cent cut in unemployment insurance payments there will be a saving next year of $129,000,000 , and by an increase in the premiums there will be an addition of $50,000,000 to the insurance fund , effecting a total annual economy in this one feature of British social service of $179,000,000 . This is based on the assumption that the number of England 's unemployed will reach 3,000,000 next year , as against about 2,750,000 at present . Borrowing Prohibited . Furthermore , Mr. Snowden announced there would be no more borrowing for either unemployment insurance- or road-building funds , that both will have to pay their way , and if that Is impossible , the deficit will have to be made up out of the Exchequer . Out of this welter of figures emerge two great facts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cooperation Government has made good its promise that the burden of meeting the crisis should be distributed among all classes of the community . Nobody escapes . ? The workless man now living on an unemployment insurance benefit of $4.25 a week will have to subsist on $3.81 . The receivers of small wages and salaries who have never paid income tax before must pay now , and except for slight exemptions varying under different conditions , every receiver of an income up to $10,000 must pay a $2,500 tax to the Exchequer . Above $10,000 every irk come will have 10 per cent added to the already heavy tax . A policeman who now gets $23 a week will receive $1.25 less after Oct. 1 . School teachers ' pay has been reduced 15 per cent . The Prime Minister 's salary is decreased by $5,000 annually and the pay of all his Ministers , members of Parliament , judges and civil servants in all government departments is reduced in proportion . Proclaims Faith in Nation . Mr. Snowden closed his grim tale in the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ; Shakespeare 's voice and Nelson 's hand , Milton 's faith and Wordsworth 's trust In this , our chosen and chainless land . Bear us witness , come the world against her , England yet shall stand . " It was Mr. Snowden 's fourth budget and also his last  --  his valeditory to the House of Commons in which he has rendered valiant service for a quarter of a century , always in opposition to the men and parties with whom he has now joined forces to save the country 's credit . But the Labor party can not cast him out , for he has let it be known that after this emergency government finishes its task he will retire permanently from public life . For Mr. Snowden today 's occasion was both triumph and tragedy . As a realist and pa : ? master in finance , he knew his duty was to do the things which as a Socialist he loathed doing and would not have done had he not believed that the very existence of his country as a first-class nation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the intensity of the recent Cabinet struggles to save the situation and by the downfall of his own government , racked with the same old pain that has clung to him ever since an accident in boyhood , Mr. Snowden stood for an hour at the treasury bench in Commons , reeling off the tragic figures which tell the tale of the failure of his beloved socialism to hold its own against the world 's economic distress . Shakes With Emotion . Often his voice and his bent frame shook with emotion as he told why a halt must be called on doing the very things which he as a humanitarian approved . No workless pensioner in this country is going to suffer so much under the new regime as Philip Snowden suffered today for his share in putting that regime into effect . When he had finished he was cheered and applauded by all his former opponents in the Conservative and Liberal parties . But he was jeered and abused by his lifetime associates on the Labor benches . They jeered and booed all through the speech whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of his increase in the income tax , although for weeks they had been protesting that the new burdens must be borne by the rich . But Mr. Snowden is always Mr. Snowden , so there could not fail to be a comic touch . When the Labor members shouted their disapproval of the increase in the tax on beer the Chancellor interrupted his speech to say , " You 'd better hurry up , for you have n't got much time . This increase on beer goes into effect tomorrow . " " I have finished my very disagreeable task , " he said in conclusion . " These proposals are admittedly drastic and disagreeable . They are justified only by the regrettable necessity urged upon us by the present financial position of the nation , but I have received during the last few weeks the most amazing evidence of the willingness of men and women of all classes to make their contribution to this effort . Pensioners Return Their Books . " This morning my post was like the post of every day for weeks past . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have offered to forego their pensions for a year . National war savings certificates have been returned canceled . " Postal orders , large and small , pour in . Children have sent from their savings boxes shillings and halfcrowns to help the nation in its need . Factory girls have come to me with collections taken in workshops , and today , following many other similar gifts , I received a 5 per cent War Loan bond for ? 1,000 to be cancelled . " These proposals that I have submitted give everybody an opportunity of contributing . I have tried as best I could to spread the burden of sacrifice as fairly and evenly as human ingenuity can devise . To balance a budget with a deficit of ? 170 , - 000,000 , to spend as we are doing this year at the expense of the Exchequer something like ? 100,000,000 for relief of unemployment , is an achievement which no country in the world has ever attempted . " The House of Commons will , I believe , accept these proposals , and the country will accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world an example of the indomitable British spirit in the face of difficulty . " William Graham , former President of the Board of Trade in the Labor Government , was chosen to reply for the Opposition . This indicaters that he is regarded as the leading financial man in Arthur Henderson 's shadow Cabinet and will be Chancellor of the Exchequer if the Labor party wins the right in the next election to form a new government . Mr. Graham 's speech was perfunctory because he was not yet ready to reveal the course which the Labor party will follow in opposition to the new government . The political situation is a bit awkward for the Labor party because it has been revealed that all the economies which the Opposition now denounces were accepted , with the exception of the unemployment measure , by the former Labor Ministers in the Cabinet sessions two weeks ago when an attempt ' was being made to save the financial situation without a change in government . In the general debate Walter Runciman , Liberal , declared that England should now prohibit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am probably the most bigoted free-trader in this House , " said Mr. Runciman , " but if we are going to balance the budget we must prevent money going out of the country for needless luxuries . We had a list of things prohibited during the war , and that list would serve well in the present emergency . Despite all the talk about our poverty , we are buying abroad as much now as in the prosperous year of 1920 . " Foreign Opinion Believed Helped . The outstanding feature of Mr. Snowden 's speech , according to the financial editor ? of The London Times , is that despite the fact that the deficits for this year and next year are substantially greater than the public had imagined , his proposals will suffice to balance the budgets for both years . Foreign opinion can not , therefore , fail to be favorably impressed , he says . ' With characteristic determination , Mr. Snowden faced his problems squarely and resisted all temptation to resort to artifices , and consequently added to his reputation , " The Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current year , is covered more b taxation than by economies , but that will not concarn foreign opinion as much as domestic , To foreigners the important thing is that the British Government has shown its determination to keep its expenditure within the limits of its income . This should suffice to check the foreign flight from the pound and restore confidence in sterling . "
