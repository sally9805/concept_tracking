txt Thirty years or so ago the late Robert LaFollette as governor of Wisconsin led the forces of " regulation " for all forms of " public utility " services on the ground that they were " natural monopolies . " In 1910 the platform of the Republican Party in Wisconsin contained the following : " We point to the regulation of public service corporations in Wisconsin during the last five years as conclusive proof that control of monopoly by the people through their government is successful , is reasonable to investors and essential to public welfare . " And the same document said : " Wisconsin stands in the forefront of states by reason of the progressive legislation enacted under Republican administration during the last ten years , including laws to provide adequate regulation through the Railroad Commission of rates and services of public utilities . " It is only fair to say of the late Mr. LaFollette as governor of Wisconsin that his case is the contrary of Charles the Second 's ( of England ) , of whom the epigram ran " Here lies our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on : ' ho never said a foolish thing , And never did a wise one . " ? upon which the comment of Charles was that it was quite true for his acts were those of his ministers while his sayings were his own . The bark of Senator LaFollette was much worse than the bite of Governor LaFollette , and the State of Wisconsin has on the whole contributed in no small measure to the solution of the vexed question of regulation . The important point to keep in mind is the " Wisconsin concept " of the public utility service as a " natural monopoly . " It is this concept  --  a correct one  --  which is the fundamental reason for regulation and not the concept of utility service as a natural governmental function . Competition Against Railroads Grows Of late years there has come an important change in the conditions affecting the principal public utility service  --  railroad transportation  --  and a notable shift of ground on the part of so-called " progressive " opinion as to " regulation . " In Senator LaPoliette 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and the rails carried pretty much all the business there was . Today the situation is notably changed . Other forms of transportation are now active competitors of the rails , and the full force of that competition has not yet been felt . It is unnecessary to do more than mention the diversion of passenger business to private motors and buses and the inroads of truck competition on L. C. L. freight . Moreover , in the case of water transportation the competition of the Inland Waterways government owned and operated service has been by no means the most effective in the diversion of freight , for the operations of private water service by large shippers on the Ohio and Mississippi River probably account for a much larger shift of tonnage from rails to water . In short the railroad " natural monopoly " is threatened with deprivation of its monopolistic character . Congress has been careful to exclude the railroads as such from the use of the controlled waterways by means of railroad owned ships . It has gone a long way in the effort to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of putting the United States itself into the zompetition . And the measure of the truck competition is found in the fact that with an increase of about 6% in the railroad carload ( originated ) traffic in the nine years to 1929 , there was a drop in the volum ? of L. C. L. freight of about 32% ? about the same percentage of decrease as is shown in passenger business . Motors seem to have been equally effective in both classes of service . Regulation Plus Competition Now Urged So much for the facts . The shift in " Progressive " opinion can be no better illustrated than by the case of Governor Roosevelt and his utterances during the recent campaign in this state on the subject of " municipal competition " with regulated utility services . He has made it plain that he favors at one and the same time a strict regulation of utility rates and , wherever possible , provision of publicly owned and operated competition for the utility . If his speech , for instance at Gouverneur , does not mean this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter is somewhat puzzling to the ordinary mind . If a utility company is to be regulated as a " monopoly " ? as it should be  --  and by reason of competition ceases to be a " monopoly " whence arises the need for continued regulation on the " monopoly " theory ? And what justice is there in such a form of regulation ? This is not to suggest that no regulation at all is in such case the alternative . It is merely to say that the regulation which is necessary in the case of " monopoly " is not properly applicable to a competitive situation . What kind of regulation is properly applicable to the latter is another question not at present in point . And the attitude of the Governor  --  if he meant what his words seem to mean  --  is more than puzzling* , it is disturbing for it seems to run counter to elementary principles of fair dealing . The Governor Should Tell There is no possible doubt of the right of the public to the best and the cheapest " utility " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are best adapted to that end are the means to employ  --  whether they are " publicly " or " privately " owned and operated , or whether they be a regulated " monopoly " or a competitive situation . If , however , there is to be a " competitive " situation it should be " competitive " and neither competitor should be strait-jacketed Further . there should be a fair ring and referee . The referee 's business should be to inform the public as to the facts and the performances of the competitors . If it be a question of cheap and efficient service then let us be told exactly what the service costs each competitor . If there are considerations other than those of quality and cost , we should be told frankly what they are and what is their weight . The public is entitled to complete frankness on these matters . It would be very helpful if Governor Roosevelt in dealing with the cost of electricity to consumers in this state would lead the way . His annual message to the Legislature will give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read it .
