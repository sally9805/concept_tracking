Among the undergraduate literary lights in the bright Harvard Class of 1910 , Heywood Broun was a mere twinkle . He wrote for the highbrow Advocate , but was not elected to its board . His serious classmate Walter Lippmann made the heavy Monthly ( now defunct ) . Rustic Stuart Chase wrote nothing but routine essays for professors . Ebullient John Reed made both the Monthly and the whimsical Lampoon . Beefy Hamilton Fish Jr . was in the literary Signet Society , partly because he was football captain . Brightest light of all was Thomas Stearns Eliot - he was taken into the two literary clubs , Stylus and Signet , was secretary of the Advocate . <P> Still going strong , the latest issue of " Mother " Advocate pays tribute to her 1910 secretary by printing a whole number in his honor . The issue was interesting principally as it showed in what ways the boy Tom Eliot was father to T. S. Eliot , the poet . <P> Tom was a brilliant , hard-working student who finished his undergraduate course in three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests were always violently eclectic , never popular . He fancied French poets but abhorred the self-conscious readings at Charles Townsend ( " Copey " ) Copeland 's rooms , and shied away from the spectacular new drama courses of George Pierce Baker . Harvard scholars then had a Teutonic reverence for degrees , and after a graduate year in Paris Eliot returned to Harvard and worked for a Ph.D . in philosophy , studying Sanskrit and Pali on the side . His Ph.D . thesis on F. H. Bradley and Meinong 's Gegendstandstheorie was accepted , Eliot says , " because it was unreadable . " He never took his degree . <P> Youngest child of elderly parents , Eliot at Harvard was tense , sensitive and reserved . His Advocate contemporaries say he was English in everything but accent and citizenship . His remarks were quiet , witty , precise but not precious . He smoked a pipe , liked to be alone , carefully avoided slang , and dressed with the studied carelessness of a future dandy . <P> Now he wears his handkerchief in his cuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes genteel drinks ( Burgundy , hock , sherry ) , games like chess ( which he plays badly ) , rummy and slippery Ann ( for low stakes ) . His undergraduate timidity has carried over into fear of cows and high places , but not of critics . At 50 , T. S. looks like an only slightly older brother to Tom . <P> In 1932 , when he returned to Harvard for a year as Charles Eliot Norton Professor , U. S. critics seethed to see him wince at Americanisms , to hear him admit he had little knowledge of U. S. poetry or interest in it . He gave reticent teas , at which young Harvard intellectuals silently watched the silent poet eat cake . Eliot seemed to enjoy flaunting his English ways : " I tend , " said he , " to fall asleep in club armchairs , but I believe my brain works as well as ever , whatever that is , after I have had my tea . " <P> In the Advocate , some U. S. poets pay respectful respects to T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinging and subtle . . . " ; Archibald MacLeish : " No one has taught us more " ; Allen Tate : " I have had only two Masters , and one of them is T. S. Eliot . "
