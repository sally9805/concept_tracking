Greendale Sanitarium . Dr. Schiller 's office . At either side of a corridor wall of translucent glass in which iron cross-bars are imbedded . Behind these glass walls we can see the inmates of this institution passing up and down the corridor  --  a procession of silent shadows . At one end is a door . The shadow of a Nurse selects a key on a large ring , unlocks the door , passes through locks it again . Dr. Schiller , middle-aged , kindly-faced , just completing the daily treatment for one of his patients . Dr. Schiller and Dr. Blane are examining a patient  --  a middle-aged Man . His Wife stands nearby . A Nurse is writing down Dr. Schiller 's comments . DR . SCHILLER No emotional reaction .

VIRGINIA ( Almost inaudibly ) All right . DR . SCHILLER First real spring day , is n't it ? Have you been out yet ? VIRGINIA No . DR . SCHILLER Oh ! Why not ? ( To Nurse ) p. 5 All right , Miss Regis . ( The Nurse goes out and sits on bench outside ) VIRGINIA Dr. Schiller . ( She stops short ) DR . SCHILLER Yes ? ( Virginia does not answer ) What is it ?

VIRGINIA Yes . DR . SCHILLER Fine ! I 'm glad to hear that . Did n't I tell you it would be easier than you thought ? ( No answer ) p. 6 Well ? VIRGINIA No , I did n't sleep well . DR .

VIRGINIA That 's all . I had just forgotten . DR . SCHILLER No , how was it ? Did you think you were at home ? VIRGINIA I did n't think anything . But I was happy . DR . SCHILLER Good . You were happy . And you did n't know you were in the hospital . When you realized you were in the hospital were you unhappy again ? VIRGINIA In a way . DR . SCHILLER Why , " in a way " ? ( She does n't answer ) p. 7 I wish you could tell me what you mean by " in a way " . VIRGINIA I ca n't . I do n't know . DR . SCHILLER All right . I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you woke  --  and you were at home  --  that is , if everything were as it used to be ? VIRGINIA Yes . You know that . DR .

Do n't work yourself up . I do n't want to make you say anything . Just tell me what 's on your mind . ( Virginai relaxes ) Let 's go on . Now  --  right now , if you woke up somewhere and were not at the hospital  --  would you be happy ? VIRGINIA Yes  --  sort of . But not as happy as before . DR .

VIRGINIA Yes . DR . SCHILLER But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody knows . They see my brother 's death , they see my death . DR . SCHILLER Why do you start that again ?

You 're the only friend I have . DR . SCHILLER Then why do n't you tell meWhat 's really troubling you ? VIRGINIA Dr. Schiller , I still ca n't feel . DR . SCHILLER You 're beginning to care about the other patients . Miss Howard is a friend of yours . You cried last week when she hurt herself . VIRGINIA I cried because she hurt herself and I did n't feel anything . Nothing in here is real to me . DR . SCHILLER Do you think outside things would seem real to you ?

VIRGINIA Dr. Schiller , I do n't want to be made sick again . I do n't want to scream at them . DR . SCHILLER You see , Virginia , everybody at one time or another has to face unpleasant things . We ca n't always avoid them . The only thing we can do is to make ourselves tougher  --  stronger  --  in order to face tham whenever they arise . If an individual tries to wrap himself in cotton as a protection against the outside world , then he becomes a fragile , artificial thing . In trying to escape from life he makes himself unfit for life . He can only be protected in a hospital , as you are . No normal human being lives alone in the world . He lives with other people and other things , and must accommodate himself to them  --  to their impact  --  to the differences of viewpoint and feeling . Possibly in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will have at least to be strong enough to withstand it if you want to go out into life . VIRGINIA Yes . DR .

VIRGINIA ( After a pause , slowly ) p. 9 I was alone in a long dark hallway . I was frightened and I wanted to find a lighted room . I heard voices behind a door . I opened it . There was no one there . It was dark and empty . I started to run . Suddenly I was carrying a doll . I ran , hugging the doll . My heart was beating so hard it hurt . I wanted to scream , but I could n't . All at once the doll slipped out of my hands and broke . ( She pauses ) DR . SCHILLER Go on . VIRGINIA That 's all . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset now about this dream ? Does it remind you of something in the past ? VIRGINIA That 's it . I can'tI do n't know . DR . SCHILLER Think of your brother . Does it have anything to do with him ? VIRGINIA ( After a long pause ) I do n't know . DR . SCHILLER How about those voices in the dream ? Did you recognize them ? VIRGINIA I 'm not sure . DR . SCHILLER What were they saying ? VIRGINIA It was jumbled . They were shispering . ( Phone buzzes  --  Dr. Schiller answers it ) p. 10 DR . SCHILLER In a little while . Have them wait outside . VIRGINIA Are they here ? DR . SCHILLER Yes , Virginia . VIRGINIA Dr. Schiller . DR . SCHILLER Let 's continue . If you do n't want to see them later  --  I 'll send them away . All right ? VIRGINIA All right . DR . SCHILLER What about the doll ? Do you remember that clearly ? VIRGINIA No . DR . SCHILLER Did it resemble a doll that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a woman appear outside with a Nurse . Even as a shadow the woman is obviously over-fashionable . An extreme hat , extravagant feathers , dripping furs , flaring coat ) VIRGINIA I tell you , they do n't want to see me . DR . SCHILLER They 're here . Your father 's a busy man . He 's put aside his business - you wrote the letter , you asked them , and they came at once . VIRGINIA Before I was here they never had any time for us . When my brother and I were little , we never say them . DR . SCHILLER All that 's past , Virginia . I 'm not saying they were right or wrong . It 's past . You 've got to grow up . You see , Virginia , you 're living in the past . You never developed emotionally beyond your brother 's deathYou want to get well , do n't you ? VIRGINIA ( Torn between the desire to get well and the desire not to get well , reflects the anguish of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low voice , she answers. ) p. 11 Yes , I want to . DR . SCHILLER Then you 've got to live in the present . Today ! Now ! Why do n't you go through with the criginal plan ? Talk to them , and try to understand their viewpoint . Once you do that you can go home with them and there you 'll have a chance to grow up , to adjust yourself to the world , to be free . VIRGINIA All right , I 'll see them . DR . SCHILLER Fine . One thing . You must n't hurt them . VIRGINIA I 'll try , Dr. Schiller . DR . SCHILLER It 's up to you . And remember ! Even if this does n't work out , there 's still hope . VIRGINIA Hope ? DR . SCHILLER Yes . You ready now ? VIRGINIA I 'm ready . DR . SCHILLER I 'll bring them in . ( He opens the door of the adjoining room , goes out . Through the clear-laned panel we see his summon Mr. and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume dimensions ) ( Mrs. McKay is a tall , too fashionably slim woman of forty-five , elegantly groomed , dressed in the very extreme of vogue . She possesses a frigid vicious beauty , accentuated by the flaring silver fox jacket , short skirts , clanking bangles , Dache hat , so incongruous in this setting ) p. 12 ( Mr. McKay , shorter than his wife , considerably oder , wizened , homely , soured , clipped , precise authority that hints of violent energy . ) ( Dr. Schiller talks to them a second . They follow him . He opens the door . They enter the room , still talking . ) DR . SCHILLER Here are your parents , Virginia . ( There is a tense fraction of a second . ) MRS . MCKAY Virginia , darling , how are you ? MR . MCKAY Hello , Virginia . VIRGINIA Hello , fathermother . MRS . MCKAY ( Goes to her , kisses her ) How are you feeling , dear ? VIRGINIA I 'm all right . MRS . MCKAY You 're looking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Dr. Schiller ) Has n't she ? DR . SCHILLER Yes , Mrs. McKay , she 's gained fifteen pounds . MRS . MCKAY It 's most becoming . MR . MCKAY Suits you , Virginia . I 've never seen you look better . You 're growing to look more and more like your Aunt Grace . Do n't you think so , Caroline ? MRS . MCKAY Ah Grace ! Nonsense ! Virginia 's pretty . ( To Virginia ) p. 13 I ca n't tell you , my darling , how pleased I was to receive your letter . VIRGINIA How is Aunt Grace ? DR . SCHILLER I 'll leave you alone with your parents . ( Exits ) MRS . MCKAY I have n't seen much of Grace lately  --  she 's very busy . She 's going to be married again . MR .

I put on your high-heeled slippers , too , and I pinned my hair up , and I sat in front of your dressing table and played that I was you . It was a beautiful dress . MRS . MCKAY Yes , I remember it . Darlin ! Dr. Schiller tolls us you 'll soon be coming home . And the very first thing we 'll do is go shopping for a blue evening gown with silver stars . VIRGINIA Would you really , mother ? MRS .

You killed him . ( Dr. Schiller comes in . Mrs. McKay begins to cry ) You 're crying , but inside you do n't mean it at all . MRS . MCKAY How dare you talk to me that way ? How dare you ! MR .

Just ( Dr. Schiller leads them out of the room . In the corridor we see their shadows . Another doctor joins them . Mrs. McKay gesturing volubly . Mr. McKay talking to Dr. Schiller and the other doctor a second , then the McKays go . ) ( Dr. Schiller returns ) Next time it will be better . VIRGINIA It 'll never be any better . DR . SCHILLER When you improve a little moreYou 'll get along with them . VIRGINIA You know that 's not true . Let me get out . I want to live again . And I ca n't in here . Please ! DR .

How 's the breathing ? Give her a hypo of adrenalin at once , and set up an intravenous glucose , 20 c.c. ' s I 'll be there right away . ( He crosses to the door , calls ) Miss Regis ! Where is that girl ? ( Virginia watches the keys on the desk , fascinated , reaches for them when his face is averted . She quickly grasps his key wallet , detaches the pass key , puts it in her bosom , and replaces the wallet . She stands there a second , breathlessly . He returns to the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! q Where 's Miss Regis ? Find her and ask her to come to my office at once . ( He hangs up the phone ) I must see another patient . You must n't be discouraged . It takes timeWait here for Miss Regis , hm ? VIRGINIA All right , doctor . ( He goes out through the side door . As soon as he is gone , Virginia looks about quickly , thinks for a moment , formulating a plan of escape . She goes to the doctor 's coat , searches in the pocket , finds a handful of small change , pipe , pouch , handkerchief , etc . She keeps the small change , returns the other articles , puts on the coat . She buttons it up , goes to the door , looks out . The corridor is clear . She slips into the corridor . We see her shadow slink down the corridor . With the pass key she opens a grilled door , then another door , and she is beyond the corridor , no longer a shadow . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . The lights in the corridor dim . Her face is illuminated by the cross of light filtering through a small opening in the door . She unlocks the door , and opens it wide . A burst of sunlight blinds her for a moment . Outside we see a slender silver birch in bud and several evergreen bushes . On a limb of the birch is a small bird , singing . The bird ceases its song abruptly and swoops off . She watches its flight a moment , blinking up at the sky . Then she fills her lungs with air , plunges into the sunlight , and out of the hospital ) p. 19 @x A cheap , second rate steam laundry . On the ground floor the drivers bring in the bundles . One man weighs and marks the soiled laundry . Another assorts them , separating the white from the colored pieces . They are then put into fishnet bags and slid through a chute into the " Kitchen " . Here , against the raw background of the cellar , the clothes are washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reek of chemicals ; the floor is flooded with slippery suds , the wet heat is almost unbearable , the walls and the ceilings , the machines and the humans , black and white , glisten constant driblets of sweat streaming off them . Here , clad in high rubber boots and aprons , is the most skilled laborer , the " Washer " . He dumps the fishnet loads into the swirling washing machines . Mixes the chemicals , - soap and bleach and acid , varying the formula for colored , heavy and light linens . After the machines finish macerating the cothes , the " Washer " rinses them - first in hot water , the in cold . Now the " Puller " . As he pulls out the colthes , bending deep into the hole of the machine , it deliberately shloshes water over his head . He hugs the dripping clothes and tosses them into a cart , which he pushes over to the " extractor " , a huge , drum-like machine . " The Wringer " Man places the clothes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a roar as the machine whirls around with terrific velocity . The flatwork , then is huge on conveyors and carried to the mangle-room , Here the Women , mostly colored , are feeding huge , insatiable roller-like machines - mangles . Some of the girls , " Shakers " select the flat work , twisted and tangled from its pounding in the " extractor " , straighten it out and lay it on tables . There other girls , the " Feeders " , pick it up , snap it with a flick of the wrist - to whip out wrinkles , and feed it to the mangles . As the hot rollers close on it , the damp linen hisses and blows clouds of burning steam into the faces of the mangle girls . At the other side of the mangles are a group of girls - the " Takers Off " As the sheets are pressed through the mangles , the " Takers off " perform a strange routine , ironically reminiscent of a Roxy ballot . They grasp the sheet by the corners and whirl it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parachute . The girls holding the corners , walk towards each other in rhythm , exchange opposite corners ; and , when the sheet descends , it is nearly folded . The starching and collar departments Old Women - hands dipped in searing starchthe drying room - a literal furnace - blasts of hearthe ironing departmenthand irons , bosom presses , collar presses , operated by human automatons weary beyond fatigue . A Truckman brings in some laundry . The Weighter weighs it , the Marker marks it , etc. , etc . The cycle continues over and over again . ( Note to scene designer : ) Since the actual elements of this scne are human beings , wash and machines ; this is essentially a simple set . The back walls of the laundry are the same as the back stage , white wash , brick and steampipes . The preceding description is intended only to create the feeling of the absolute steaming , sweating , reality of the laundry as compared to the weird , tenuous unreality of the hospital . The actual set is in three playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a two-step platform . A huge scale with the name " Sunbright Laundry " painted on it and a chute , is all we need to indicate that zone . The second zone , the " Kitchen " , the lowest level , can be on the stage floor proper . All we need to indicate that are several machines on casters . The third zone , a corner of the mangling room , should be on a higher platform , containing a mangle machine , a section of wall with a window and a long table . Coming down from the mangling room , a constantly moving conveyor , which is simple a clothes line on which sheets , etc. are pinned . The weighing and marking room .

" said the child . " I was his wife , my dear . " She was the wife of a young man of three and twenty ! Ah , true , it was fifty five years ago . " You wonder to hear me say that , " remarked the old woman , shaking her head . " Yes , I was his wife . Death does n't change us any more than life , my dear . " ( The El roars by . He looks up .

It does n't matter what time of day or night it is . When Rocco feels low , he 's just got ta throw that bone . Goodnight . ( He turns over and is snoring gently . The El roars by . Harriet is still sitting up , tense , on the verge of hysteria ) p. 50 CURTAIN p. 51 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONE : Scene 3 John 's rooms . The next morning . Harriet asleep in the bed . John , snoring softly , rolled up in the blanket on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-huddled series of tenement houses . Feet on the stairs . A dog barks . The clatter of hoofs across the way . Distant alarm clocks going off . A sick baby cries . The alarm clock rings . John half wakes , groggily sees Harriet , is suddenly wide-awake , and quickly smothers the alarm clock . Then he glances over to see if she has been disturbed . She moves , moans in her sleep , then turns over on the other side and continues to sleep undisturbed . John pulls on his trousers , goes into the kitchen , prepares some coffee , sets it to boil . He then washes himself , and finishes dressing . He goes into the living-room , watches Harriet for a while returns to the kitchen takes a bag and some butter out of the ice-box . In the bag is a single orange . He decides not to eat that  --  puts it aside . From another bag he extracts half a loaf of rye bread , cuts off a thick slice , butters it , pours a cup of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cup in one hand , slice of bread in the other , he tiptoes back , and stands by Harriet 's bedside , eating his breakfast quietly , while he gazes at her . He suddenly catches himself day- dreaming , looks at the clock guiltily , gulps down his breakfast . He lowers the flame under the coffee , slices the orange , places it on a plate , sets the table for Harriet 's breakfast , swats a couple of flies that go after her breakfast ; then covers it all with newspapers to protect it from the buzzing intruders . He finds a pencil , rips a piece of paper from a grocery bag , writes a note , leaves it on top of the covered breakfast , takes hat , coat and topcoat , tiptoes out , shutting the door carefully and slowly . The medley of noise increases . The tenement across the way awakens and prepares for a new day . We see growing activity through the windows . From the stable across the way comes a clatter of hoofs as the horses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assorted programs in assorted patterns . The El roars by . Harriet awakes with a start , looks wildly about her , realizes where she is , springs out of bed , dresses quickly in terror , is about to rush out , sees the note , stops , reads it , uncovers the breakfast , looks at the clock , realizes it is too late for work , sinks into a chair , confused , reads the note again . She calms down , tastes the organe , begins to eat , her self-assurance returning . She pours some coffee , finishes breakfast , sighs , starts to go , looks back at the dirty dishes , returns , takes them into the kitchen and washes them . She starts to replace them on the shelf , but the shelf is so befrimed that it dirties her hand . The filth disgusts her and for a mononu she stands there regarding it with revulsion . That feeling passes . She finds a rag and cleans the shelf . Then she stands by the window looking out . She catches glimpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the alley is shaking bedclothes out of the window , beating them with a cane beater . Harriet slowly walks into the next room . She slaps the pillow on the bed . Clouds of dust come up . She tears off the bedclothes , throws it over the windowsill to air . She pauses to catch her breath . She returns to the next room , puts on her coat , slowly leaves the room , shutting the door behind her . In the hallway she pauses , the opposite apartment door is open . She sees Mrs. Zubriski on hands and knees scrubbing the floor , watches her fascinated , then starts down the stairs , pauses , returns , re-enters John 's apartment . She touches the floor , It is filthy .

For the first time she relaxes and is happy as she scrubs and slowly finds the rhythmShe has become a part of the life around her. @x The same .
