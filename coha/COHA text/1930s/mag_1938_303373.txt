Employes of Phillips Petroleum Co. refer to it as " Phillips Pete . " Sharp-eyed Founder Frank Phillips , now chairman , is called " Uncle Frank . " Heavy-set President K. S. Adams has been titled " Boots " ever since he went wading in a Kansas City flood . Slight , bespectacled President Thomas B. Hudson of The Polymerization Process Corp. , Phillips Pete 's favorite offspring , answers to " Tubby . " This nicknamed outfit last week registered $25,000,000 in debentures with SEC . Wall Street was sure they would have an easy sale-for in polymerization , Phillips Pete is fathering the latest technique in gasoline manufacture . <P> Gasoline was first made by distilling crude oil , then by the " casing-head process , " next by " cracking , " finally by hydrogenation . Cracking , of which hydrogenation is a continuation , consists of breaking down the molecular structure of heavy crude oil into a number of lighter , more salable derivatives such as kerosene and gasoline . Polymerization is the reverse ; it takes the very lightweight , gaseous fractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restricted ways , * and through pressure , heat and catalytic agents builds them into heavier molecules for high-test ( antiknock ) gasoline . <P> Motor knocks are caused by a part of the fuel burning too rapidly , causing pressure and temperature changes characterized by a sharp " ping . " Knocking quality is measured in octane , a 100% antiknock laboratory fluid . Most regular-grade automobile gas is about 70 octane . By polymerization Phillips Pete developed 100 octane gas-useless for modern automobiles but invaluable for airplane engines , which must get maximum efficiency and sudden " burst " response on take-off or emergencies . Howard Hughes used 100 octane gas provided by Standard Oil on part of his round-the-world flight , and it is increasingly in demand in military aviation . <P> Eying this field , Phillips took out a set of polymerization patents , soon ran up against competing patents owned by Texas Corp. , Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) , Standard Oil ( Indiana ) . Rather than wage a costly fight , these four companies pooled their patents under The Polymerization Process Corp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up two massive polymerization units at Kansas City and Borger , Texas , baffled the oil world by turning out 100 octane gas in quantity too great for any known U. S. use . All Chairman Frank Phillips will say is that " the total output is being sold abroad to a foreign government . " Eventually , Oilman Phillips expects automobile engines to be adapted to use 100 octane fuel .
