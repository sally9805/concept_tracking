txt The chances of the Glass banking bill 's being adopted in the present session of Congress . grew dimmer today after Senator Long carried on a three-hour filibuster against the measure , aiming particularly at the branch banking features . He was assisted by Senators Bretton , Thomas of Oklahoma and others , and the trend of the battle served to emphasize the wide difference of opinion on banking legislation held by conservatives and liberals of the party . Senator Long defied virtual demands of the Senate leadership that he give way so that all business would not be tied up . Finally he served an ultimatum that unless the bill be stripped of its branch banking features and other compromises be made the fight would go on . " You 've got until March 4 to pass this bill if you are to have a President who is going to sign it , " he exclaimed , turning to Senator Glass . " And you are not going to pass it by March 4 . Put that in your pipe and smoke it . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only until March 4 to put this thing through ! Your only chance on God 's earth is to lame duck this through the present session , ' and that is not far enough off for you to do it . " Long Is Deaf to Pleas . Senator Watson , Republican floor leader ; Senator Robinson , who holds the same post for the Democrats , and- Senator Hale , who wanted speedy consideration of a deficiency bill so that a fund might be immediately available for feeding the destitute in the Capital , all took a hand at trying to divert Senator Long from his purpose . But he would not give groat ( ' until after he was assured he would not be sidetracked by legislative technicalities . Then he yielded to the deficiency bill , bait it was indicated that the quarrel would be renewed tomorrow if a compromise failed . Senator Glass , author of the bank bill , sat quietly throughout the attack , ready to press for quick action if the opportunity offered . The only real clash came when Senator Long said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week than in our State in a year . " " Oh , that is untrue ! " exclaimed Senator Glass . " I ca n't let that go unchallenged . That Is absolutely untrue . " Senator Long replied that he knew more about it than did Senator Glass and went on , unperturbed , with his address . Senator Long began by demanding the reading of the journal of the last day , which consumed twenty-five minutes . When he tired a bit , he gained rest by sending to the clerk long documents to be read . Questions Glass 's Statements . He began by ridiculing a comparison which Senator Glass had made yesterday of bank failures in the United States and Canada and questioned the accuracy of remarks by Mr. Glass . He blamed not the banks , but failure to- remonetize silver , - for conditions in the United States and estimated that there was now only between $600,000,000 and $700,000 , - 000 in currency available in this country to carry on business . Taking up the statement by Senator Glass yesterday that Presidentelect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of that assertion . He said that in January , 1930 , in addressing the New York Legislature , Governor Roosevelt had made it plain that he was against centralization of the banking power . Senator Long charged that J. P. Morgan &; Co. was the power behind the throne in turning banking and legislative opinion in favor of branch banking . The edict , he said , came in a speech by Thomas W. Lamont , a Morgan partner , after which the American Bankers Association , which had first condemned branch banking , changed its views . Two measures which had.b2en submitted by Senator Glass , prior to the present proposal , he added , had contained no branch banking feature . " What the President-elect pays do n't count much when the House of Morgan speaks , " he exclaimed . He asserted that " the Lord himself " had been opposed to the centralization theory and interpreted a quotation from the Bible to that effect . In the course of his speech Senator Long exclaimed that he had a program of his own to_the cure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , to give work to the unemployed , cease production of cotton and wheat next year if there was an oversupply , and then proceed along lines of decentralization and of spreading out the great wealth now accumulated in a few hands . If necessary , he said , he would use a capital levy to obtain his huge fund . His chief objections to the Glass bill , he said , were the branch banking section and restrictions placed on the sale of municipal and government securities by the small banks . If these changes were made , he said , he thought he could support most of the other provisions . Before Senator Long obtained the floor , Senator Bratton pretested against the branch banking feature of the bill , which he held would set up three or four power banking up three or four powerful banking facilities of the country . Senator King said all agreed that something should be done , but expressed doubt that branch banking by national banks was the cure .
