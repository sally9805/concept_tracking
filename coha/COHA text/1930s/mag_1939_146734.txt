Three weeks ago , as the British-French military mission was on its way to Moscow to try to conclude a three-way alliance with the U. S. S. R. , another British mission was reported heading for Danzig . No one knew anything about it , except that its leader was a certain Professor Riley , and that it was vaguely economic . In Tallinn , Estonia , a reporter of the Swedish Aftonbladet credited the mysterious Professor Riley with a startling declaration : " In Britain we are by no means convinced of the vital necessity of Danzig for Poland . . . . The Commission has undertaken its trip under Government inspiration . I 'm convinced that the results of our inquiry will have the greatest influence on the future position of Britain with regard to Danzig . " <P> Who was Professor Riley ? Guesses began to fly : perhaps he was Durham University 's eminent Chemist Harry Lister Riley ( no ; reporters found him vacationing in Northumberland ) ; a Government bigwig , sent , as Lord Runciman was to Czecho-Slovakia in August 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squabbling over ( Downing Street denied it ) ; a personal emissary of Neville Chamberlain 's sent behind his own Government 's back to pave the way for a second Munich agreement ; perhaps just a crank . <P> As the British-French-Russian military talks got more &; more press notice , Professor Riley got less &; less . Russia 's witty Defense Commissar Kliment Voroshilov received the British and French delegates with sparkling good will . They dined and wined each other . The Russians took their visitors to the annual " aviation holiday . " Everyone was in great good humor ; every one thought the alliance was all but accomplished . <P> But this week Professor Riley was back in the news . The Russian press suddenly bristled with charges that Britain sought another Munich agreement . This time it would be between five big powers , with the U. S. included , the U. S. S. R. not . Why had hypocritical Mr. Chamberlain sent this Riley man to Danzig without even consulting Parliament ? " Signs of a serious set-back to the attempt to get Russia into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Correspondent G. E. R. Gedye cabled the New York Times . He could scarcely have expected how momentously right and wrong he was to be proved in the next 48 hours . <P> Late Sunday night-not the usual time for such announcements-the Soviet Government revealed a pact , not with Great Britain , not with France , but with Germany . Germany would give the Soviet Union seven-year 5% credits amounting to 200,000,000 marks ( $80.000,000 ) for German machinery and armaments , would buy from the Soviet Union 180,000.000 marks ' worth ( $72,000,000 ) of wheat , timber , iron ore , petroleum in the next two years . And at Monday midnight the official German news agency announced from Berlin : <P> " The Government of the Reich and the Soviet Government have decided to conclude a non-aggression pact with each other . The Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs , von Ribbentrop , will arrive in Moscow Wednesday to conclude the negotiations . "
