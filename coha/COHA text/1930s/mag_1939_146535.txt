THE LONG DREAM - Sigrid Boo - Dutton ( $2.50 ) . <P> Americans think of Norway as a cold slice of northern forest and fjord , of Norwegian writers as weighty ( like Sigrid Undset ) or gloomy ( like Knut Hamsun ) . But a Norwegian novel published this week is as different from this preconception as its author 's startling name . It could have been written in any country of Europe . <P> An Oslo Kathleen Norris whose eight books have been translated into 13 languages , Sigrid Boo ( rhymes with Hoo ) at 40 makes her first U. S. bow with The Long Dream . As befits the country that originated the langlauf ( long-distance ski race ) , her novel is slow in starting , spends nearly half its length on the heroine 's retrospective thoughts during a train journey back to her native town after seven years ' absence . <P> Novelist Boo weaves a leisurely ring around the triangle of Dagrun Styhr , her husband , Paul , and Steffen Thomasgard , the man whom Dagrun had first loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book that even its climax , when Dagrun and Steffen are marooned overnight on a deserted island , seems unexciting . Sigrid Boo thinks her book would make a good movie , hopes that fellow Scandinavian Garbo will play the lead . It would take the Garbo face and voice to put umph in such a gentle boo .
