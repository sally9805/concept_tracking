" Eastland " v. England <P> Any conceivable air attack on Britain would come from the East , so when the air games were held by His Majesty 's Royal Air Force last week the hypothetical enemy was significantly described as " Eastland . " Britain sent requests to her eastern neighbors to keep their airliners out of the " war area " over the North Sea . The German air services meekly obeyed . But the proud Royal Dutch Airlines responded with a bristling reply to the British Air Ministry : THE NORTH SEA BELONGS TO NO NATION AND NOBODY IS EMPOWERED TO CLOSE IT TO INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC . IF ANY BRITISH FIGHTERS INTERCEPT OUR LINERS . . . THERE WILL BE SERIOUS COMPLAINTS . There were no interceptions . <P> Britain 's Air Secretary , Sir Kingsley Wood , dapper , chubby and dynamic , witnessed some 900 bombers and fighters in the games . After three days of " war , " Britishers were more skeptical than ever of their defenses . Aided by typical English fog and mist , " Eastland 's " bombers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits , on interior manufacturing centres , including Norfolk , Suffolk and North London . Territorials , firing anti-aircraft rockets , were unable to prevent " Eastland " squads from roaring over London . As a crowning gesture , one " Eastland " squadron located the defenders ' GHQ at Hornchurch , Essex , gleefully swooped down to the attack just as the Air Secretary and his official party were making their inspection . A touch of grim realism was added to the mock war as seven planes crashed , six fliers were killed .
