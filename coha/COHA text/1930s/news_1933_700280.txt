txt Will Rogers Discusses Vital Football Crises To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Dec. 8 . ? United States Cabinet members can change , but when Notre Dame changes coaches you are getting into real news . Anderson just run into bad breaks . I bet he will go somewhere else and turn out a great team , and Elmer Layden will come there and do great , for he wo n't be following Rockne . There just did n't happen to be anybody living that could follow Rockne . And while we are on football and off the gold , this Columbia College that 's coming here New Year 's , being New Yorkers they never was away from home , so naturally they are not known out here , but we have heard of Nicholas Murray Butler , so we want ' em to bring " Nicholas " with ' em . We will hear a good speech even if the game is bad . Yours , WILL ROGERS .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
