All of a dither last month were San Francisco financial circles over the well-authenticated report that potent Banker Amadeo Peter Giannini had testily refused to list a new issue of Transamerica Corp . stock on the San Francisco Exchange until benign President Frank Shaughnessy resigned ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) . Since Transamerica for years had been the busiest stock on the San Francisco Exchange , this gave brokers , already scratching for commissions , a real matter for worry . The squabble grew out of old " A. P. 's " decision to turn Transamerica , once the world 's largest bank holding company , into an investment trust . One move of this program was a splicing of Transamerica stock , one share for two , reclassined from no par to $2 par . When the San Francisco Exchange took occasion to criticize this maneuver , " A. P. " did not apply for a continuance of Transamerica 's listing . <P> All this was raw material for a very pretty business feud , but President Shaughnessy declined to make it into a finished product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept Transamerica on the board through a temporary technicality . By last week this breathing spell had cooled everybody off . The Exchange gracefully came down off its high horse , " requested " the listing ; " A. P. " as gracefully agreed . President Shaughnessy remained in office and San Francisco 's brokers strode down Nob Hill jauntily once more .
