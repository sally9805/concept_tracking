Dr. Julian Sorell Huxley , well-known British biologist and popularizer , last week went to the ant . Considering the ways of this celebrated biological subject , of which more exist in the world than of any other kind of creature and which evolved a complicated social organization some 30,000,000 years ago . Dr. Huxley decided that the ant may be methodical , but it is stupid . <P> For one thing , ants can not tell the difference between ants and non-ants working in the ant hills . They make indiscriminate food deliveries all around . For another , they allow a species of butterfly to invade the nests and eat the grubs . The ants tolerate this because they like a sticky substance which the butterfly exudes . " It is , " commented owl-eyed Biologist Huxley , " as if a nursemaid were to allow a wolf to carry off the baby from her pram in return for a nip of gin . "
