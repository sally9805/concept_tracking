Up early one morning last week were all of Italy 's royal women , notably H. R. H. the Duchess of Aosta. blue-eyed Crown Princess Marie Jose and imposing Queen Elena , who at 8:45 a. m. in a drizzling rain mounted the marble stair of Rome 's Monument to the Unknown Soldier . <P> Amid the dead silence of a massed throng which pack-jammed the enormous square and all side streets . Queen Elena opened her velvet handbag , extracted with visible emotion her gold wedding ring and the King 's , dropped them into a large bronze urn . An Archbishop advanced and blessed two iron rings lying on a red velvet cushion while Her Majesty knelt with lips moving in silent prayer . <P> In trim blue suit and white collar the widow of General Turba , one of Italy 's World War heroes , next presented the velvet cushion and Queen Elena , taking the two iron rings , dropped them into her handbag . Then in a low voice she broadcast : " These rings , symbols of our first joys , symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our country . With them we invoke before God victory for the young sons of Italy who defend rights which are sacred . We pray for the triumph of Roman civilization in Africa . " <P> Her Majesty at last gave the straight-armed Fascist salute , originally the Roman salute of the Caesars . After returning it the multitude of women began to file past the urn , dropping in gold rings all morning , all afternoon , well into the night . By this time Rome , with a population of approximately 1,000,000 , had given some 250,000 gold rings , the day 's total for all Italy being computed later as worth $80,000,000 . Among the wives was the Dictator 's . Millions of Italian women , unlike their Queen , reacted first to their new iron rings by at once trying them on . Since the warm Latin temperament packs super-sentiment into one 's own particular wedding ring . Italians who could afford it pack-jammed every jewelry shop in the Kingdom to buy new gold rings for some 250 lire each ( $20 ) to drop into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wear the ugly iron of patriotism . Eight years ago at the watering place of Agnano , the present Emperor of Ethiopia gave a gold ring to his spinster bath attendant . Adele Chierchia , saying , " Let this be your wedding ring when you marry . " Still a spinster and still a bathwoman , Adele dropped Haile Selassie 's ring last week into one of Benito Mussolini 's urns .
