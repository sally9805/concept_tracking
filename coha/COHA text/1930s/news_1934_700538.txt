txt The Ross Divorce Bill . Tothe Editor of The New York Times : I have been reading some of the arguments advanced by the supporters of the Ross Divorce Bill and find ample provocation for a smile in the contention that the bill would tend to decrease " wholesale collusive perjury . " Granting the premise for a moment , it still must fail , for we have a more powerful weapon against collusion in our penal laws covering adultery . These laws have been on the books for a long time , but they are not enforced . - The evidence to secure a divorc- in the civil courts under the present law would be sufficient to sustain a conviction for adultery in the criminal courts . Convictions for adultery not only would punish , and justly so , actual transgressors , but would serve to deter all prospective defendants in collusive undefended matrimonial actions . It seems to me that a prison sentence for which our statutes provide would not be regarded so lightly . LOUIS A. CRISANO . New York , March 30 , 1934. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
