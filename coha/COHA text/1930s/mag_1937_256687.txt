Manhattan 's R. H. Macy &; Co. sells under its own brand name in its famed department store some 3,000 articles including bicarbonate of soda , Epsom salts , witch hazel , face powder , lipstick , milk of magnesia , shaving cream , peroxide , cascara pills . Last week a consignment of 48 of ' ' Macy 's Own " drugs and cosmetics , including those named , arrived not at Broadway &; 34th Street but in Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , where it soon filled a large window and several counters in the " Boston Store " of Fowler , Dick &; Walker . Wilkes-Barre citizens , dripping from an all-day downpour , bought 15% of the shipment on the first day . For retailers in general this was interesting news . For manufacturers of " national brands ' ' it was the latest package of perturbation from Macy 's . Tentatively , but none the less clearly , the department store had entered their own field . <P> Macy 's insisted that it was all an experiment , a response to continual requests from out-of-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to stock up at Macy 's . To give them a kind of room service and oblige local shopkeepers Macy 's set up a new corporation , Supremacy Products , Inc .. under President Percy Selden Straus 's eldest son , Ralph . To a selected store in each trading area Ralph stands ready to sell " Macy 's Own " merchandise " price free , " i.e. , to be marked down or up as local conditions require . Some of Macy 's 8,000 branded articles are made to order for the store , others by Macy 's own factories in Long Island City . <P> In Manhattan , Women 's Wear Daily , glad rag of the garment trade , found national brand manufacturers skeptical of the success of Supremacy Products . Why , they asked , should any store carry Macy brands instead of developing its own ? If Macy 's really proposed to compete with national brands how could it do so without spending a great deal of money in national advertising ? One obvious reason , however , for the move on Macy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's could dispose of-wholesale or retail-the lower its production costs should be . <P> Most bumptious reaction came from the American Booksellers Association , still glowing from Doubleday , Doran 's triumph over Macy 's in the court battle on New York 's Fair Trade Act ( TIME . March 22 ) . In solemn glee A. B. A. 's Counsel Crichton Clarke called a stenographer , dictated a statement pointing out that no stores in Macy 's own trading area would be favored with the new service . " Macy 's does not care how much its private brands are cut in other markets , " said Mr. Clarke , " but it will not permit them to be cut within its own trade area . ... If this is not an acceptance by R. H. Macy &; Co. of the principle of price maintenance within its own trading area , I certainly wish Mr. Ralph Straus or Mr. Q. Forrest Walker , Macy 's economist , would explain what it is. "                  @ @ @
