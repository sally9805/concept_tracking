committee can work out in a month or in a year what the world has directed itself toward for long generations , somewhat as problems in mathematics often direct themselves toward the symbol of infinity . Improvement and change must be promised and they must be delivered . But life has always resisted that word " security " and the fact behind the word , and it will not easily surrender to a committee . What is more , the emphasis on security as the highest attainable human goal is creating a nervous dread of insecurity which neither past nor present history justifies . The fear spreads too far . There is no wonder that a person who has long been out of work , who has no resources , who has known the suffering of want , should hate and fear insecurity . But when I see , as I often do , men and women trembling in their very comfortable rooms over the thought of it , and men and women , who are employed , shivering over a possible future insecurity and wondering how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not help feeling that they are  --  to put it swiftly  --  yellow . There was a period in my own life when I was badly frightened . It was between the war and the depression , and most people were getting along pretty well just then , so I was more lonely in my miseries than people out of luck are now . The exact circumstances are of no matter , but the facts were that I had no sure or dependable income , and I did have debts , responsibilities , sickness and no hacking . One day , breaking down to some extent , I said to an older man that I could not see my way ahead for more than a few months . And he answered : " Well , most people in this country can only see ahead until Saturday night . " He spoke with no great pity for either them or me , though he was a kind man . I have never forgotten the statement or what did to me . It was not offered as a philosophy , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffened me up . It did not stop my believing in insurance , or slacken my energy or my ambition to reduce my difficulties . But it was salutary to be reminded that insecurity in itself is not fatal , nor unusual ; until lately we have expected a certain amount of it in our lives . Some people have had far too much . Most of those twenty million people who Mr. Richberg anticipates will be on relief this winter have had more than their share of insecurity . Everything practicable should be done to make their futures firmer and more reliable . But that is one thing . It is quite another to talk of pensioning all the people in the country more than sixty years of age . Tocurzsencl  --  Plan Problems I AM well aware that people like myself , who frankly doubt the possibility of attaining a nation-wide security , are put in a difficult position . We are instantly accused of a desire to hold back progress , of being unfamiliar with the sufferings of insecurity and of being antisocial . I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dole or an unearned income , no matter how these things might be disguised under new names , to object to them would be unprogressive . But such things have none of the earmarks of progress . They are palliatives as old as time , usually defeating progress . On the second point  --  that of being unfamiliar with the pains of insecurity  --  people , of course , differ . I happen to know something about them myself , but I think the point is irrelevant . What is agony to one is not to another . Temperament , hopefulness , health , responsibility , insensitiveness or its reverse , all modify the individual 's reaction to insecurity . As for being antisocial because one contests certain claims of Utopian propagandists , ' can imagine no more truly social business than to analyze such claims as thoroughly as intelligence permits . My objections to theTownsend plan are in no sense malicious or unfriendly . I think it begins with a very appealing note of human sympathy . But without any hostility , I would like to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It evades reality . It ignores justice . It treats economic questions too emotionally . In the first place , I do not think you can build up the country by the device of spending money and creating wants . Am I wrong , or have n't we just tried that method ? Did n't we come out rather badly ? Secondly , this plan leaves out of account the difference in need , habit and mode of life between the people who would get these pensions . Thirdly , I can imagine no way in which the expenditures on which the revolving fund is completely dependent can be insisted upon or checked without an army of supervisors . Beyond that , one comes to consider the confusion that would be created by such a blanket endowment . Each person is to have two hundred dollars a month . As soon as such a scheme were set in motion , the heavens would be rent with cries that injustice was being done . Three old people might live together and have six hundred dollars to spend for their pleasures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six small grandchildren might have to take care of them all on the two hundred dollars . How about the hundreds of racketeers who would spring up to sell everything conceivable to these old people ? Who are n't so very old , by the way . How about articles ordered in . January and not delivered until February ? In which month are they to be considered as purchased ? Who is going to oversee bills and make sure that they are n't falsified ? How about sons and daughters living on their parents ' pensions instead of taking these " released jobs " ? How about borrowing at . fifty-eight against the expectation of a pension at sixty ? Such sly little loans would be inevitable . In a very few words , how about adjusting this pension and its requirements to the almost infinite variations of ingenuousness , extravagance and cupidity with which life must work ? I am not arguing the point that men of financial experience bring up . They tell you that after the establishment of such a plan , the value of money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty days and purchasing power be enormously reduced . That might be debatable . 1 am not emphasizing my own belief that a sales tax is just as much opposed to good economies as it ever has been , and that in many states we are already letting expediency run away with us . I am not going to quarrel with the amount proposed by Doctor Townsend , because it diverts the discussion . Two hundred dollars a month would be a great luxury for most old people , certainly , if we pause to consider the distribution of the national income . Think of the flurry of trying to get it spent by the thirtieth of each month , and the nervous stresses ! I am not so sure this plan would make elderly people happy or keep them peaceful . But let that pass . My chief objection is that any plan based on spending , and on trying to create wants instead of training them , could never bring anything but trouble . It begins at the wrong end . Our experiences with relief have taught us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very frugally on Government money . Now the Townsend adherents make the claim that relief would disappear because we would reabsorb the unemployed in the jobs vacated by those more than sixty years old and in new jobs created by the effort to supply their wants . But what is this pension except a form of relief ? ? What is the demand made on citizens that they may be eligible ? Merely that they have , at least habitually , kept out of jail . Is that all a country has a right to ask of its citizens before it extravagantly pensions them ? And what might we expect but more arrogant demands from the pensioners ? Sentiment Minus Sentimentality Sometimes it is incredible to me that , even in a time of severe and painful need like the present , we should have grown so outrageously sentimental . To say that every old person does not deserve a pension now draws the blackest of looks toward the speaker . But the fact is true . Continuance of life in itself is not a virtue . So much depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthily , industriously or in dissipation , with civic and social generosity or in personal selfishness , exhausting other lives . The theatrical tremble in the public voice of this country just now when the words " old age " are mentioned , the sloppy sympathy , the ready tears , are not things on which we can build either the restoration of what we have already lost or the progress we hope to gain . A life well spent , or spent . as well as conditions allowed , or a life which has been ill-rewarded for its efforts , all deserve great and tender consideration in their enfeebled year ? . Even selfish and evil old people have to be cared for . But we must keep our heads and stop sobbing . There have always been old people , and usually age is wise or tours , geous or dreary , according to what went before in life . We can not square all these things with two hundred dollars a month or any other number of dollars a month . I believe in the wisest social insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I know this : That the best social and old-age insurance must be drawn from funds to which a man or woman has contributed while earning . The industry which lute employed him , used his abilities for its profit , and possibly worn away his strength , should also contribute . Perhaps the Government as well must set aside part of its taxes for the same purpose , if the revenue from the first two sources is insufficient or interrupted . But . however this may be worked out , insurance should be something that you save and I save for ourselves , at least in part . To some extent it should be contingent on our efforts and earnings , and not a pension handed out because one of us was lucky enough in crossing streets to live until sixty . Various and Sundry Ideas The EPIC plan of Upton Sinclair had more of the outlines of the classic Utopia . Thoughtful radicals had little hope that it could work . Thoughtful conservatives had still less hope . It was a conception of an attempt to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal commonwealth within fairly small compass made it reminiscent of schemes that have been dreamed of throughout history and attempted every now and then , always unsuccessfully . Mr. Sinclair ignored reality . California is not an independent state . It is no Brook Farm and can not be segregated from its country . It is one of a group of states and Mr. Sinclair can not put it under his arm and go off with it . We should not neglect that aspect of several contemporary Utopian schemes which include or lead naturally to secession . Mr. Huey Long , in a recent interview , spoke  --  no one knows how seriously  --  about the possible secession of Louisiana and what he could do to that state if he got it off by itself . I do not like to mention Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Long in the same breath . For Mr. Sinclair , to my mind , is a man of consistent opinion , which he has only slightly confused by temporary affiliation with a party that obviously had as little sympathy for him as be must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , in spite of that , where Mr. Sinclair stands and has stood for years . I do not think it matters much where Mr. Long stands , or if he stands at all . He serves , however , to confuse the thought of the country , because some people are bound to take him seriously . And how about Minnesota ? Minnesota has recently elected a governor and a fairly complete slate of subsidiary state officials , all of whom campaigned for a co-operative commonwealth  --  the words are theirs as well as the victory . The majority of the people of Minnesota did not want this commonwealth , but , because Republicans and Democrats will not change their spots , that is the plan to which the state government is now actually committed . And the Farmer-Labor platform says : " Palliative measures will only fail . Only a complete reorganization of our social structure into a cooperative eommonwealth will bring economic security . " There we are again , back to economic security , and I think that anyone will admit that the dominant political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature will probably not permit much of the doctrine of the Farmer-Labor Party to get into action , that a referendum of all the people would be necessary before we could engage upon state ownership and , on the face of the present vote , would be unsuccessful , are interesting facts , but beside my immediate point . All I am trying to indicate is that /qr . Olson , Mr. Sinclair , Mr. Long and Mr. Townsend are all talking about economic security , that their plans have no unanimity , that each of them has a very considerable following and that none of them is on Mr. Roosevelt 's committee . These schemes are only samples of many others that will come to the surface , especially during impending or current legislative sessions . Some will he easily dismissed , but others may take hold of the popular imagination and he difficult to deny . One trouble is that the enthusiasts who are so absorbed in making over the world and in doing the job in record time are shouting down the realists . We are becoming afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to applaud what ought to be true or what would be nice if it were true . We are also becoming rather ridiculously self-conscious about the imperfections of a society which , until recently , no one assumed was anywhere near perfection . Not long ago I was standing in the office of an institution which antedates the Civil War . On the wall were photographs of the founders and men who had subsequently carried on the same work of caring for the needs of seamen . They did n't look like fools . They looked shrewd and wise and generous and thoughtful and as if they might be deeply moved by trouble , just as men do now who take an interest in public affairs . They were aware of these dreadful social imperfections . It occurred to me then that there is great temerity and insolence in the rather current feeling that such men had no appreciation of social problems , and had left everything for us to work out . Who are we to think we are so clever ? American Evolution It is true that great advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . The whole citizenry of the United States has become convinced not only that economic distribution should be fairer but that it is going to be fairer . Further , and in the same direction , the country 's popular ambition has shifted . Also , in a time of great distress , whenever the weather turned on us , first with bitter cold and then with scorching heat , the people of the United States have been cared for and have cared for one another . We ought to be proud of ourselves for that achievement . It is n't a small one . But we should not forget , in our vanity , that we have been able to do much of this because there were incomes to tax and industries to regulate and private generosity to stir . Most of our professors of reform got their start in privately endowed institutions , where they taught and were taught economics and politics . All this time we have been drawing on the reserves of the past , and yet it is popular to turn on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future must soon  --  almost immediately  --  be perfect . With such premises , loose thinking proceeds to the idea that the Government should , can and will provide security for everyone . And a discord of demands arises as to how this is to be done . Now , how much security can a government promise its people ? I do n't think that is too hard a problem for simple contemplation . We should know that much . Our own Government can go a long way . It can try to protect its people in time of war , though less fortunate nations than our own have been forced to sacrifice fur too many citizens to protect the security of others . It can afford security against unlawful search or seizure , against unfair detention , or cruel punishment . It can extend the vast and undefined functions of its police power to maintain order , capture criminals , exercise supervision over the health and working conditions of its people . It can promote research and experiments which may bulwark physical security . On and on one goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is doing . But there is one thing that a government can not do . It can not earn a living for the individual . It can , of course , provide employment for individuals in one way or another . But there is a limit to that . When the Government goes beyond the point of paying for services which it really needs , or when it creates meaningless jobs , ' it is simply storing up trouble . This is true of any government , national or local . One of the most hard-up municipalities I know of today is a town of twenty thousand which in the days of prosperity was so overrun with fake political jobs that at one time there were two highly paid truant officers and not a record of a child skipping school . They had good schools and penny lunches . The children wanted to go to school every day . Taxing Peter to Pay Paul There is another way a government can provide employment for its citizens , and that is by taking over the industries and resources of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly developed Socialism or Communism . Whether the reward of this employment would be synonymous with economic security , to say nothing of comfort , would be dependent on the national income . We do know this : that in other countries where this is tried , many people are not on relief . They starve . We do know that the modicum of security which the average worker is assured in Russia keeps his standard of living far below that which citizens of this country , even many of those on relief , insist upon . And our standard of living is none too high . It looks higher than it is because of the installment plan . The only other method by which a government can supply individuals with money or its equivalent up to the point of security is by taxing one citizen to support another . This has gone about as far as it can in this country without drying up the sources of taxa , lion , and it already has created vast dissatisfactions . The Government 's sympathy and benevolence have resulted ungratefully in creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said this : " Among our objectives I place the security of the men , women and children of the nation first . " As a pronouncement from the highest executive , this is a noble statement and a warming one . Januar , . 19,1935 But I wonder if many people do not misunderstand it . For this governmental and official conception of security , as later defined by Mr. Hopkins , does not mean " that society owes every man a living , but it does mean that every man shall kayo access to the opportunity to provide for himself and his family a decent and American way of living . " How many people took in that qualification , which simplifies the promise to what the United States has always wanted to do for its citizenry ? The objects of the New Deal , out , lined by Secretary Wallace in his recent book , also seem to define what the new security involves . Mr. Wallace says that the New Deal has among its objectives , " a job for everyone who wants one , wages high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance against unemployment and old age , and perhaps also against injury and sickness , comfortable housing , planned utilization of land so that unnecessary depletion by erosion and similar process will be avoided . " The Tea of New Ideas These statements of Mr. Wallace and Mr. Hopkins are sufficiently restrained . " Access to opportunity " is not a dole . " To leave no one in serious want " is not a promise of a pension . But if one reads the statements carelessly or listens to the minor prophets  --  and so many do  --  the impression is that security is far closer and more practicable than it really is and that , moreover , it can be attained by some juggling of taxes or possibly by having citizens take in the Government 's washing while the Government takes in the citizens ' washing . So get-security-quick schemes spring up , and no one would care or pay any attention to them if they did not delude people . But it seems to me just about as bad to sell people a false scheme of security as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in San Francisco tells me of good , diligent people firmly believing that at sixty years of age they will each have a pension of two hundred dollars , with the single obligation of getting rid of it in thirty days , / am impelled to speak my mind . We are all too much afraid just now of being considered unsympathetic with poverty , or antisocial , or out of step with new ideas . I would quite as readily he out of step with new ideas as old ones unless they happen to be good ideas . And it is not a good idea to promise security which can not be delivered . There is just a little more to be said on this point because some special pleaders make a distinction between security and economic security . There is a difference , of course , and they can dance on a needle if they want to . But as people are thinking of the word today , in its current and sociological use of the moment , the distinction is somewhat artificial . Also economic security is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of security , even physical , can stand long without it . Hermits of great endurance sometimes manage to separate personal security from economic need , but few others can . The holding of a job at a consistent wage and being justly pensioned at a proper age is partially dependent on physiological and psychological factors . Also economic security has always been a family arrangement , and a very private one . One income or inheritance dovetails into another . Mrs. Smith has a little property , and when it is rented , she helps her husband out . But it is only occasionally rented . When she can , she pays certain bills . It is all informal and no books are kept . if the Government is to guarantee the kind of security that a great many people are beginning to hope it will , the steady income they expect of it , its knowledge of a family 's affairs should be extraordinarily complete . It should know more than members of a family often tell one another . Before we 're through , the Government would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people for whom it was caring . I know , of course , that the wise people in the Government have no such fantastic ideas , but a great many honest citizens think that the Government in some magical way can promise  --  indeed , has already promised  --  economic security to the individual citizens of the United States . Assuming that principle , the most unworkable schemes are proposed . One more thing must be mentioned , and it is the one that always makes trouble for us in the United States . We are citizens of a country of vast extent . Closely detailed social schemes , devised in miniature , work less well or break down altogether when they are applied over our great areas . We ought to admit such things . We sentimentalize past all reason . It is no lack of sympathy that prompts me to feel that no single solution can solve thousands of problems or satisfy millions of people . It is the knowledge that mistakes are so depressing and expensive that makes me protest against putting dreams into practice . Progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word was needed to express the recurrent dream of mankind for an ideal commonwealth , its sympathy with suffering and hatred of poverty . We have not discovered poverty in this generation , though we act as if we bad both created and discovered it . The decades have already slowly worn away tyranny , torture and slavery in the countries with which we are most concerned . Civilization has made headway against poverty . We are more impatient with it now in this country than we ever have been , and to me that is the great encouragement . This awareness , on the part of everyone who is not a fool , that the world will no longer conduct its affairs for the benefit of a few fortunate people is our greatest stride so far . Much can be done to improve the condition of those citizens of the United States who are in distress . Much has been done already and forgotten with a careless quickness that is appalling . The Government can probably provide better prospects of security . It can , to a large extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he works according to his abilities , accident , illness or old age will not make him an object of charity . It can not make this assurance absolute , because of the possibilities a nation always must bear in mind , such as war from without , civil uprising , severe political change . But it can promise that under any normal conditions a good citizen will not be left stranded . I hope that it can go farther and make it possible for any industrious man and woman to have work as long as he is healthy and capable . Government can do this best , as history is apt to prove , by not playing favorites among its citizens or allowing its sympathies for the unfortunate to make it con- temptuous or unfair to the capable or fortunate . If we are not to have a co-operative commonwealth or a state of Communism , we must rely upon the capable and not keep crying them down . For the capable not only work but they give employment to others . Probably they would not produce Utopia . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enterprise encouraged , in which education is fostered , in which both employment and the giving of employment are regarded with honor , has a better chance of helping its people to safety and means of sustenance than anything on the horizon . The lige.Old Dream That is about as far as government can go . It can not pension its people into security , because security is not a matter of money alone . Of course , one is often dependent on the other . But the most unhappily insecure man I know today is a rich one who has just fled to Europe with his money . I said at the beginning of this article that I did not know how to get security or how to keep it . But I have my own substitute . I live in a troubled state and in a troubled country , and the future is not at all clear . But I try not to be afraid of it . Perhaps that is the answer . Security is in a person , who is in luck or out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the body of a nation . Security is here in the United States today if we do not rot it with subsidy . You will repeat there are twenty millions of people on relief and I will repeat that I know that and suffer at the thought , but that I do not believe spending unearned billions will ever get them off relief . I have been reading over again the plans for some of the ideal commonwealths of the past , and almost every problem we have today is closely considered in them . Campanella 's City of the Sun argued for a four-hour day , which goes our present plans one better . Thomas More writes : " They are not employed in fruitless labor , " which might be adopted as a relief motto for 1935 . Oceana , by Harrington , which certainly influenced those American political thinkers who were working on our own Constitution , emphasizes a natural aristocracy , personal liberty , parliamentary government . I saw no mention of pensions or of creating wants . The emphasis was on temperance and restraint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility . They aimed , these great classic Utopias , at trying to include all that man needed for his wellbeing . But , in the end they invariably assume that the citizen will work diligently to create the wealth of the state , not that he will he supported by the state , unless he is truly unfit or infirm . Men will not stop dreaming of the ideal state and nobody would want that to happen . But we can not carry dreams into our waking hours when we must do our work . We must work with the real state and not encourage delusion . I do not want to be deceived by any Utopian scheme , no matter how beautifully it is presented . But I do not forget that out of them we can draw nobility of purpose . There is one thing about that Townsend plan fundamental and useful . It reminds us we must not neglect the proper claims of old age . That is true . It is , I believe , the one thing we shall remember about it .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
