MAN OF GLORY : SIMON BOLIVAR-Thomas Rourke-Morrow ( $3.50 ) . <P> For millions of South Americans the greatest man who ever lived was Simn Jos Antonio de la Santsima Trinidad Bolvar y Palacio , liberator of Colombia , Bolivia , Ecuador , Venezuela , Peru , Panama . Simn Bolvar ( pronounced See-moan Bow-lee-var ) has inspired litanies like those to the saints . His tomb at Caracas-the " Pantheon " - is almost as much a religious as a national shrine . Venezuela 's President Contreras reputedly goes there to pray . <P> North Americans not only do not share this hero-worship , they probably know less about Bolvar than about any national hero in history . Such ignorance , thinks capable Biographer Rourke ( Gmez : Tyrant of the Andes ) , is a gauge of " a century of misunderstandings and suspicions between the two Americas . " A knowledge of Bolvar , he believes , would go far to explain South Americans ' history and temperament , particularly their tendency toward dictatorship . For it was that tendency which set Bolvar 's main problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> From his young manhood , no prophet could have predicted Bolvar 's future . Heir to one of the biggest fortunes in Venezuela ( his childhood income was around $20,000 a year ) , this slight , hot-tempered , handsome young Creole aristocrat was the pampered darling of his family , at 17 began his conquests in the salons and boudoirs of Europe ( Queen Maria Luisa of Spain was rumored one of the many ) . Then suddenly he left on a walking tour with his old tutor , a votary of Rousseau and the Greeks . Three months later , in Italy , Bolvar made his melodramatic vow to free the Spanish colonies in South America . <P> He was then 23 . Within the next 19 years he fought nearly 500 battles , over an area almost the size of the U. S. , twice fled to exile after complete disaster , made his comeback in some of the most spectacular forced marches and brilliant battles in military history . Simultaneously he battled his compatriots to establish a democracy which would be foolproof against dictatorship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately nicknamed " Culo de Hierro " ( Iron Arse ) , Bolvar would suddenly break the tedium of a march by challenging his companions to outjump him . He liked to dance with female camp followers around the campfire , would break off abruptly to dictate ( in Spanish , French or English ) his fast , polished sentences to a secretary . He pardoned his venal aides , refused to feather his own nest , praised his generals unstintedly . He deliberately resigned as Supreme Chief in order to discourage dictatorship . <P> But when he was away his generals began plotting to junk the Constitution . Five years after military victory the new republics were chasing after dictators faster than Bolvar could run . When Colombia started a counterrevolution and his beloved General Sucre was assassinated Bolvar wrote : " All who have served the Revolution have ploughed the sea . " <P> The end came shortly afterwards , on December 17 , 1830 . Wasted to skin &; bone , coughing blood , racked with hemorrhoids , the 47-year-old Liberator cried out in his last delirium : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want us here ! "
