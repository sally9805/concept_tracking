txt If the construction industry could offer increasingly better values at progressively lower prices , so that each purchaser would be confident that he had secured a real bargain , as the automobile industry succeeds in doing , our recovery problems would find rapid solution , Colonel Leonard P. Ayres , vice president of the Cleveland Trust Co. , stales in the bank 's current business review . He comments that most of the business recovery that we have had in this country in the past two years has been contributed by the three leading producers of automobiles who manufacture most of the cars and trucks that are made in this country . " All the net gain in the volume of industrial production from 1933 to 1934 was equal to that made by the automotive industries , " he said , " and the suppliers of its materials , and the gains so far in the production of 1935 over 1934 have been mostly due to the same factors . These astonishing results are a striking tribute to the ability of those producers to improve the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of higher wage rates and shorter hours . " The key to our depression problem of unemployment is the idleness a the producers of goods , for it is because there has been a great reduction in the output of goods that there is much unemployment among the providers of services , says Colonel Ayres . In comment on the capital market , Colonel Ayres says there is no precedent for the present anomalous condition . The old law that supply will respond to demand has been suspended so far as new capital issues are concerned . The evidence that this Is so is to be found in the fact that abnormally high prices for existing bonds do not succeed in calling forth an increased supply of new bonds .
