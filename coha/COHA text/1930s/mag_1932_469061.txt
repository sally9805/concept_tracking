This genuine autobiography was written by a sixteen-year-old girl in a State penal institution . It reveals , as only a personal record can , the process through which boys and girls in slum areas in our cities are educated in crime from an early age . A further note concerning the article will be found in the Personal and Otherwise pages. ? The Editors . I WAS born in Chicago . The first thing I can remember is taking care of the baby . I had two older sisters , but they were always out running with their gangs , I guess . I had a brother but he never helped any . We lived in a two-room apartment in a basement in the back . The yard was used by a junk man . When it was warm enough I used to play in the yard with the pieces of iron . People in the elevated trains could look down into the yard and at the backs of the buildings and I guess they said my God , what kind of people they are to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . She did scrubbing in buildings . If somebody nosey would tell her I had been sitting on the curbstone in the street instead of watching the baby she would beat me but she did n't beat me Saturday nights . She would hold roe . When I smell gin I sometimes think of mother holding me and crying . When my father worked for the junk man he slept at home . He beat my brother sometimes but not me . I started to school when I was six years old . The charity woman gave my mother some clothes for me . Once I had an awfully good pair of shoes . They were part patent leather and had straps . They were too long for mebut I stuffed rags in the toes and pretended I just had big feet . I loved those shoes . In the third grade I made my first friend . It was a girl I called Bunny . She was the first one I ever liked . Bunny had long blond hair and brown eyes while I had brown hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in the same room with Bunny . I used to go junking and pretty near break my back dragging a load of stuff to the junk man to get five cents to spend with Bunny . I went over to the railroad track early in the morning to pick up coal and sometimes I 'd go on a little farther and get a chance to snitch a milk bottle or a loaf of bread and then I had breakfast . When I saw a gang of boys getting ready to upset a push cart you bet I was right there to grab some apples or whatever it was . The first time I remember I used my head was one day I went and stood by a railroad station and cried . l kept out of sight of the cop . A man asked me what was the matter . I said I was hungry and he gave me a fifty-cent piece . Was I happy ! I went and got a sundae and some gum and then went to a movie show and saw it through twice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to mother , My father was away somewhere and we had n't had anything at home since the day before except part of a loaf of bread . I told her I had found the money . I realize now I was selfish and should have brought more money home . I worked the railroad station pretty hard and always got enough for a movie and a soda and a dime to bring home . But the cop caught me and told me if he saw me there again he 'd take me up . He made me tell him where I lived and the next day the truant officer came to see my mother and she laid into me . After that when I got the yen to go to a movie I worked other stations . If the cop got wise to me I 'd beg off because I was so little , I was only eight years old , and you bet your life I never again gave the correct address of our apartment . Peaches was a girl I liked almost as well as Bunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourth grade we started going to the stores , not only the five and dime but the big State Street stores . The first few times I went to a store with Peaches and Bunny I did n't take anything . I nearly fell over when I saw Peaches take a bottle of perfume . She said I was a fool and she 'd show me how to do it . We would go in another store and while she and Bunny were talking to the clerk I was to take something . Well , they stopped by a notion counter and I took a spool of black thread . I was so scared I nearly dropped it . Next time I tried for something better than a spool of thread . That fall I got a string of amber beads . I was crazy about them . It was the first thing like that I ever had . I adored my beads . Peaches was awfully good in the stores . She could spot a store detective as far as she could see him . We would walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did our shopping . That firstwinter I remember I got a ' pair of stockings in one department store basement and a pair of gloves at a glove counter . They were grown people 's size . I sold them for ten cents to a lady in our neighborhood . All the kids had to do something . Naturally we never had anything at home so we had to go outside to get it . Up to that time I had never had anything to do with boys . I never thought I would live to regret those days of poverty and struggle for every little thing but I do now . It was exciting going through the stores . I was caught a few times but I begged off . Once I had a purse in my hand and it was a mighty good thing I had n't got it out of sight on me because I was grabbed with it but I said I was just taking it to the light to look at it . The officer took me to the store door and shoved me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time I had a lipstick in my stocking and a sweet little pink brassiere in my coat sleeve but he never frisked me . We were in the fifth grade when I met Jimmy . I told mother Sunday night I was going to the Settlement House , which was always a good way to get out . I met Bunny and we fixed up our faces and rolled our stockings in an area way . Bunny made me put on lots of paint and she put on lots too so as to make us look older . A little way off a car drove up to the curb and Peaches was in it with three fellows . The one I got was a blond named Jimmy . We drove around awhile and got something to eat and drove out into the country on a gravel road . We just did some petting and I did n't want to be a wet blanket so I did some too . The boys did n't come out there just to look at the scenery . I nearly died when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but we did n't have any clock in our apartment so when I came home I swore it was half-past ten and I was saved that time . Monday night I said I was going to Bunny 's apartment to study my lesson . She had everything ready and said that Jimmy had said last night I was hot stuff . The boys brought something to drink . I refused at first but they kidded me so I tried it . Later they asked me why I did n't join the funnel gang as I just poured it down . Wednesday night I went out again with orders to be back by ten o'clock as mother was watching me . I met Bunny and the boys and away we went . Out in the country Bunny and her fellow got out for a walk . I stayed in the car with Jimmy . I was twelve years old . I had gone out II quite a lot when I began to wonder how Peaches got all her nice clothes and everything she could want Bunny had to work one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was by being hard boiled . She did the talking and , believe me , she talked straight . We went for a drive with two fellows and when we got hack to town at ten o'clock we left them in their car and went to a drug store where two other fellows were waiting . I did not know the fellows but without asking anything about them I got in their car . I came home at two o'clock with a ten and a five spot , the first bills I ever touched in my life . Mother was sitting up for me . She asked me where I had been and what I had been doing . I told her I had been at Bunny 's and fell asleep . She did not believe me but I got by with it . The drinking was the worst part . I would come home so I could hardly walk but I would eat raw onions and stay in the alley until I was sick and then I could fool mother if I did not go near her . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , but I told her they belonged to Bunny . My first real swell outfit I got for dancing at a stag party . I did n't know what I was expected to do until I got there with Bunny and Peaches but when I saw the dress and all that went with it I said I would dance too , and when I put my clothes on you bet I put on the new outfit and were they swell ! I got other clothes outfits the same way . The first time I came home good and lit my mother sure laid into me and maybe you do n't think I stayed out after that . It just made me mad and want to do something to get even . It was a short time after that a bunch of us was in a speak when it was raided . A boy grabbed me and pulled me through a trap door in the barroom . We came out in daylight a block away from the place . I was pushed into a car and away we went . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark with deep blue eyes and dark hair . When I found courage to speak I asked who he was and where we were going . He said his name was Darcy and we could go to his flat and get something to eat and drink . I was shaky and needed something to drink . He had a swell apartment . I stayed there a week and three days and then Bunny came and said my mother was real angry and if Bunny did not tell where I was there would be trouble . Bunny told her they killed me and threw me in the river and she believed it . That afternoon I went home , and did I catch hell ! My father had come home . He did not touch me . He looked at me and at my clothes and said the law will get you and do n't come crying to me when it does . I laughed it off and asked when I had ever come crying to him or anybody . I was independent so I left home and got three rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of the day or night but it was Okay by me as they were paying part of the rent . Well , one night Bunny came to the flat with two fellows . We all went to a dance and met Peaches and came back . We were all lit . The next day we were all sitting around the table trying to feel like a million dollars . Darcy had on a bathrobe , the others had on something . Bunny and 1 were in dressing gowns and Peaches in pajamas when the door shoved open . Bunny 's mother had come in without ringing and did she lay us out ! 0 , boy ! Shoplifters , sneak thieves and were the words she used . We let her rave on and when she was through we gave her ten dollars . I said I 'd have to move now because they knew where I was . I did move and about a week later I got caught in a raid and it was three days before Darcy could get me out . He was connected with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my independence then I sent mother a telegram I was going to live in another city . So I moved over to the North side and took an apartment near Broadway , three rooms and a bath . The flat was swell . It had a big bedroom with two beds , chairs , and dressers , a living room and a low down , that is , a room with just a big rug and pillows and cushions on the floor . Bunny told her mother she was going to see her aunt in Cleveland and she came and joined in the flat , going fifty-fifty . We got in with a man of about forty who owned a speak and we went to work for him . For the next year , her fourteenth , the autobiography of this child is a bald , merclless account of the life of a girl employed by a combination speakeasyand brothel . Joe , the proprietor , is kindly and pays them well . Their vocation is nothing but boredom and weariness , but their appetite far excitement is insatiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by automobile speeding . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon . I had just got out of the bathtub when Bunny came in . We went out to get something to eat and coming back I bumped into a goodlooking fellow and we began to talk . It was my night of so I told him to come to the flat about eight and I would go riding with him . When we were out in the sticks he began to argue with me but I told him there were times when a girl did n't feel like messing around and this was one of them . He had begun nice enough but he ended sore and he said if was going to be that way I could walk back and it was about fifteen miles from Chi . So I got out of the car and started to walk . I had on a new pair of slippers ( ouch ) I just kept right on walking . He drove beside we and said get in , he had never made a girl walk yet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next time I went riding with him I 'd take a pair of roller skates . He begged me to get in and asked me if I thought he was a fool to let me get something on him . He said I know about your racket and how you work the fellows but I ca n't have my name dragged in the paper and if you try to break up me and my wife I 'll kill you if I have to go to the chair . I told him I had heard the wind blow before and to tune off . When I got back to Chi how sore my feet were but a night 's sleep fixed me all but the blisters . Joe raved for a week . He said Chicago is a big place but I will find that guy if it takes me all my life . It only took a month . This guy did n't know I worked in Joe 's and he came in there one night with another man and I showed him to Joe . In a minute Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs and took him out to the car . Joe gave me the gun ? it was a forty-five ? and told me if he made a move to fill him with lead . Joe drove about thirty miles out . We were talking all the time about what would be the quietest way to finish him . The guy was a nervous wreck . I thought he had lost his mind . He begged us to think of his wife and little baby . Joe said , you did not think of how she would feel after walking fifteen miles in a new pair of slippers . Finally we got back in the car and left him to walk while we drove ahead . Every time he would stop Joe would shoot around his feet . About ten miles from Chi he could n't go any farther . He laid down even if we killed him . I got Joe to help him in the car and we went back to Chi . The way I happened to quit Joe 's was that Bunny and I and Peaches was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back we passed a little town about sixty miles from Chi and going by a Dry-Goods Store about 4 A.M. Bunny began to rave . She said the man who owned it had done something mean to her . I bet she had never seen the store or . the man but she said Darcy had to go in there and wake him and beat him up . While we were arguing Peaches and another kid pulled out their guns and rattled the windows with lead . A couple of cops blew up and we were so lit we said everything to them we ought not to have said and the end was the boys got sixty days behind the bars and we had to pay a stiff fine . When the boys got out the six of us went to East St. Louis . We wentto Blackie 's place . He would n't let us in until I told him the bunch was all right . T told Darcy I was going to have two weeks straight rest and just keep quiet every minute of the time . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . But two or three clays of quiet was all I could stand and we began to drive around places . I got into a fight with some fellows and one of them gave me a black eye . I met a very nice looking woman and she invited me to come and live in her house . I thought I 'd try anything for a while but I found I did not like it so in four days I told her I was quitting St. Louis and going back home . It was in the kitchen . She said she would show me if I was too smart to work and she grabbed a bread knife . I picked up a little paring knife . That 's where I got the scars on my arm but I gave her some she will always have . I got out of the place alive and that was about all . When I got back to Chi I called up Darcy and said there I was , what was left of me . Was I glad to get back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not a clean spot in it . When Bunny sobered up enough to see the mess things were in she began to clean up a bit . I told her the joint looked like a bootlegging joint . Darcy was in trouble and told me likely he would n't be able to go to the front for me for a while . It did n't seem as if we were getting anywhere very much so Peaches talked Bunny and me into going back home . Well , I went back and started to school but was not there enough to know where the lessons were at and when I was I would go to sleep because I would be up until two or three in the morning and then go to school at eight . I could go to sleep standing up . My mother had quit picking on me . It was n't any use . I had her move into a better place in the neighborhood so I could stand it to stay there . She had better clothes and food than she ever heard of before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took it as a joke . That is one good thing about our bunch , when anything happened we took it as a joke and let it go at that . Darcy just laughed it off . That is where I learned to take everything with a smile and I still do it . Darcy took it on the chin and he said it was better than on the nose , as he got into the car with a laugh . Bunny came into the flat one day . I had been lit for three days and was just sobering up . I was in bed with a box of candy and a magazine of actual stories . Bunny said why did n't I get up and go to work , it was evening , but I said I was right there for the night . She helped herself to some candy and took a smoke and I asked her what she had on her mind . She took an inhale and then said she was going to have a baby . That ( lid not shock me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me if she should go through with it . I asked her if she was ready to settle down or would she go on working after the baby was born . She said if she did not go on working she would starve . She said Jack wanted to marry her but she did not want to tie up to him . I told her she would better not go on with it then , as you can not bring up a kid right in speakeasies and fast houses . I told her if she would tell Rocco it was his he would pay for everything but she said she had thought of that , only Rocco was in the pen up to two months ago so that would n't do . At last I told her I had enough money to foot the bill and I would do it for her again but this was the last time . She came back from the country in a month and you could not tell there had been anything wrong with her . Bunny and I were going to a joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found the place was going to be raided and she said I could not go . That cut no ice with me , of course . I took a bath and when I came out to get dressed mother had locked up my clothes . I walked out in a kimono and went four blocks to Bunny 's place . She had gone to meet me but I had a key . The place did get raided but I got out of it and we stayed at Bunny 's . My mother called up the jail , hospitals , and police stations and everywhere she could think of . Bunny asked me why I ever gave up my flat and went home to live but I said my mother had not been well and I wanted her to be able to find me if anything happened and if I had a flat she would not know where it was . My brother tried to stop me another time from going to a place he said was going to be raided . He said they would take everybody to the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family any more . I went anyhow and got away by luck , but my dress was almost torn off me and Bunny 's was worse . We went to Peaches ' place . Bunny said she did n't care about the clothes so long as we got away . Of course , she said , dresses do n't grow on trees but you can buy them in dry-goods stores . There was a bunch of fellows in Peaches ' place and we got enough money for our clothes out of them . We kids got into the schoolhouse one night by the area way and went to the domestic-science room and opened all kinds of cans and dumped them on the floor and broke all the eggs against the wall . Then we went from room to room messing up everything . We took the cards the teachers marked the kids on and tore them up and emptied their drawers on the floor . April Fool 's night us kids all got pickled and it was storming so we called up a garage and said we were in two cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had our car hid back in the woods and when they got there all they found was an April Fool sign in the middle of the road . We were watching , and gee did they want to tear that town up ! I went to see Darcy in jail . He had me sell his big car but put the runabout in storage . I sold the big car to Rocco . Darcy wanted me to keep the money but I put most of it in the bank and spent some for things he needed as he was going to the pen the next week . Bunny got in a jam because she took a poke at a woman who had a nice pair of pearl earrings Bunny thought she needed . Poor Rocco had to make another trip from St. Louis to get her out . He was angry as he could be and asked me when I was going to get in trouble and send for him . We all went to Rocco when we were in a mess because he was older than any of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry who had come up from St. Louis at the same time . Rocco told us that Jerry was the guy he had been with in St. Louis and that Jerry was the big shot of the gang . That was all he would tell us . Jerry was tall and dark like Rocco . They were both Italians . We all liked Jerry . Rocco thought there was no one on earth like Bunny and Jerry trusted me so they did not hesitate to plan their jobs right in front of us in Jerry 's flat . One night in Jerry 's after he had been acting crazy all day a man brought him something to the door . I saw Jerry with something shiny in his hand and his sleeve rolled up . In a few minutes he was all right but I was horrified . I found I was living with a doper . I was hurt and angrybecause he had told me everything but not that . It was not long after at a week-end party that I caught Jerry paying attention to a blonde , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry just laughed and said I was a baby . I went to her man and ordered him to take her away and there was a general fight . Not long after this one night Jerry asked me to take a shot with him . I refused but woke up later feeling a sting in my forearm and he had given me one . I got up , pulled on something and ran to Rocco 's flat and he and Bunny mixed me something in hot water so I would n't he sick when the shot began to wear off . I never prayed in my life before but I prayed then , I was so scared it would get hold of me . I was in terror of dope . Jerry never asked me again to take a shot . Jerry gave me a good beating one night when I came in and would not tell him who I had been out with . He seemed to think he could tell me what I could do . I would have left him and gone home but I knew where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat and I stood for it and then one night he came up to me where I was standing on the corner with Bunny and some kids . He grabbed me by the arm and said I was going back to the flat . It made me so angry that he would follow me that I called him everything but his right name and he knocked me down on the street . Then he helped me up and took me home . I made up my mind it would be the last time he would knock me down before a bunch of people and the next day I went home . I had learned a lot from Jerry and I was not sorry I had lived with him . It was always said of Jerry that when he got in trouble he took it on the chin and not on the button . I learned to be hard and if anything bothered me to cover it up with a smile and I still do . Jerry told me always to think of life as a gamble and if you won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that is the way I have looked at life , just a gamble . Jerry knew that I would never spill anything as one thing I learned with that bunch was to keep my mouth shut . Bunny came and ask me to go back to Jerry but I said nothing doing that I cared a lot for Jerry but I was not going back to him . Iv As soon as the school officer heard I was home they came after me to go back to school . I told them that when I got well and felt like going hack to school I would do it and not before . I was very sick and could not move from one side of the bed to the other . One Friday they came and said I had to be in school Monday . I got out of bed and went to school but when I got there they would not let me in class . They took me to the doctor 's office . I said I had my own doctor taking care of me but that would ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get ready for an examination . They gave me one . I had IT . Bunny came to me at home and said Jerry would get me across the State line if I wanted to but by that time I was so sick I did not care what happened . The next Friday morning I was sitting up in my bathrobe in a big chair reading an actual story magazine when there was a ring at the bell and an officer and another man came in , with a warrant for me . I went into the bedroom and put on a skirt and a sweater . Mother was begging the officers not to take me away when I was so sick . I told her not to squeal as it would not do any good . She ask me why I had put on those things and I said I was not going to ruin my good clothes in a jail . They took me down in a patrol wagon and when I got to the lockup , Cappy , the turnkey , said he was sure sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been out with a lot . I told him not to worry , this was not my first time and I could not expect him not to lock me up . I was there an hour when a plain-clothes dick came in with my mother . She was all crying and begging me to tell the gentleman . He set to work to get it out of we how I got that way but I had nothing to tell him or anyone . I laughed and told him if he would go and get me something to read and a lot of candy and some cigarettes I would tell him . He was fool enough to go get them and when I had them inside my cell I told him to get to hell back on his beat that he knew as much now as he ever would know . I was there over night and the next day they took me for a hearing . I painted up the best I ever made myself up in my life to see the Judge . They all wanted the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got nothing out of me . I could have had bail for five hundred dollars but there was nobody to put it up unless it was Jerry , and I would not say a word to bring him into it , as my mother already had spilled it there was someone named Jerry . He was in trouble already over his jobs . I got word to him and he went out of town but first sent me a lot of magazines and a five-pound box of candy . Well , he could have had some one put up five hundred dollars bail for me and got me across the State line , but I was too sick to care or want anything . All / remembered was to keep my mouth shut . At last the Judge sentenced me to come here for eleven months and at the end of that time I could come home to mother and be a good girl . I was too sick to laugh . Anyhow I was brought out here by an officer with another girl and a kid that was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I never spent a more heavenly three weeks in my life . Altogether I was in four months Isolation . All I had to do was sleep , eat , and read . I got my strength back and gained several pounds . Well , you know all about my record here . I was put on Garden and got in a fight . I was not used to hard work or work of any kind and I did not like it . I did not ask to come here . Why should I break my hack and ruin my hands ? The girls here are some of them liars and squawkers . I had to have some candy and while I was on Kitchen I took some sugar and made some and they begged for some of it and afterward when the plate was found they squawked on me to save themselves . I wo n't have any good time butwhen I get out of here I will take life as I find it because what else can I do ? A fine , pure , noble , reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm welcome . 0 , yes . But I am not a liar or a squawker . No one can call me that . I am doing a lot of thinking because what else can I do in this hole ? But if you know what is going to become of me I do n't . I used to be crazy to be a movie actress but I know better than that now . Perhaps I will learn shorthand and office work but it 's not very interesting , although they say it 's a way to meet a lot of nice fellows . I do n't know what I 'll do but naturally I say it will be something noble because that is what I am expected to say . The lady who lectures me and bawls me out tells me how serious life is . Well , if she knows anything about life somebody told it to her but as for me I 've lived it . Last week I was sixteen years old .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
