The 81-year-old chairman of Britain 's Royal Arms Inquiry Commission ( TIME , March 4 ) , Sir John Eldon Bankes , last week watched his eminently dignified investigation skid off into the ditch of sensationalism . First a spokesman for 26 peace organizations uprose to charge that two members of the present Cabinet owned shares in the great munitions firm of Vickers : the Right Honorable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister , Secretary for the Colonies ( 25 shares ) ; and the Right Honorable Sir John Gilmour , Home Secretary ( 3,066 shares ) . " It can not be healthy , " said the peace spokesman , " if it is known that members of the Cabinet may be in a position to benefit personally , however slightly , from the breakdown of armament negotiations . " <P> Blushed Cunliffe-Lister : " I plead slightly guilty . I find to my surprise that I own three shares of Vickers stock bringing me dividends of 7 shillings a year . I thought I had sold all my Vickers holdings years ago . " Star accusation of the session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Communist Party , charged that George V 's own cousin , Prince Arthur of Connaught , held 5,000 5% preference shares of Vickers . <P> Vickers is frankly a munitions firm , but huge Imperial Chemical Industries , among whose subsidiaries are six munitions firms , claims that less than 1% of its profits are from munitions . Venerable Chairman Sir John began to frown when Communist Pollitt reeled off the names of holders of I. C. I. stock as " an indictment of the Capitalist class as a whole . " Outstanding names : Quaker Cocoamaker Barrow Cadbury ( 30,875 ) , Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 833 preference , 5,414 ordinary ) and the Right Rev. Edward Thomas Scott Reid , Bishop of St. Andrews , Dunkeld and Dunblane ( 2,100 in ordinary and preference shares ) . Sir John knew what was coming and finally it came , that Sir John himself owns 1,000 preference shares , 765 ordinary and 170 deferred in Imperial Chemical Industries .                 @ @ @ @
