At Calshot , England , where British speed pilots were preparing for the Schneider Cup races against Italy and France on Sept. 12 , a young lieutenant last week climbed into the cockpit of the Supermarine S-6 , which won the Schneider Cup two years ago . He was Lieut . Gerald Lewis Brinton. 26 , youngest member of the British Schneider Cup team . It was his first flight in the S-6 . <P> The plane slid along the surface of the Solent until it was going about 200 m.p.h . It cleared the water for a second and then dropped back to it . A tower of spray shot up . The S-6 bounced 40 feet in the air and then plunged down into the Solent , nose first . When Lieut . Brinton 's fellow officers reached the ship in a speedboat , it had risen again , upside down , with wings and tail torn off . The wreckage was towed ashore and the dead body of Lieut . Brinton removed from the tail of the fuselage , where the ' shock had wedged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed in Schneider Cup trials and elsewhere. * <P> The S-6 was not one of the planes which the British Schneider Cup team planned to race this year . Two new planes have been built , powered by Rolls-Royce motors , which are believed to be capable of achieving 400 m.p.h . In external design , they resemble the planes which won the Cup for England in 1929 . The Italian planes , Macchi-designed , are intended to do better than 400 m.p.h. ; each has two 1,500 h.p . Fiat motors , two propellers set in tandem . About the French planes , little is known except that they have been reported as surpassing 400 m.p.h. in secret trials . A British victory this year would give England permanent possession of the Schneider Cup . <P> <P> * The others : Giovanni Monti , killed three weeks ago at Lake Garda ; Henry Richard Danvers Waghorn , died of injuries after a test flight crash last May ; Tomaso Dal Molin , killed testing a plane in 1930 ; Lieut .
