Nothing which ex-Soldier Adolf Hitler is being shown in Italy this week by ex- Soldier Benito Mussolini outranks in social significance the Province of Littoria , reclaimed since 1931 from the noxious swamplands of the Pontine Marshes by Italian ex-soldiers for themselves and their families . One morning last week , before the Germans should arrive in their pomp ( see p. 16 ) , Il Duce slipped behind the wheel of his little sports car , whizzed out of Rome to do at Pomezia ( see map ) a bit of informal work as a stonemason- which used to be his trade . <P> Bronzed peasants of the Province of Littoria , every man an ex-soldier , shouted rustic greetings to the Dictator as he pulled up his car , jumped out . The local Bishop was waiting , for close collaboration of State &; Church distinguishes the Mussolini dictatorship from others . A hollow cornerstone of what will be the Church of Pomezia was ready , Il Duce slipped in a parchment and some newly minted Italian coins of 1938 , seized the trowel and slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cornerstoning other cities of Littoria ( see map ) , namely Littoria , the capital of the Province , Sabaudia , Pontinia and Aprilia . " Ceremonies such as these require no speeches - for facts are more eloquent than words ! " said the Dictator shortly , before climbing back behind the wheel of his car . Up went cheers in which the Italian peasants were joined by a delegation of Japanese university students who shrilled : " Banzai ! May you live 10,000 years ! " <P> This week the thorough German curiosity of Hitler about Littoria is causing Italians gladly to rehearse in detail the history of 2,500 years and more . Littoria is a stretch of land 15 mi. wide by 50 long lying between the Lepine Mountains , which drains down onto its bogs and the Tyrrhenian Sea . What is now Littoria was , before the days of Ancient Rome , an extremely fertile country whose natives , the Volsci , were adept at maintaining the ditches and drains they had built to turn these swamplands into fertile fields , with 24 rich cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later culture , sacked the cities and killed off the Volsci . About 600 B. c. they were first smitten by dread malaria . Of these dire swamps wrote Vergil , Juvenal , Martial , Horace , Ovid and others , including Madame de Stael and more recently Gabriele D'Annunzio . Julius Caesar made elaborate plans for reclamation , Augustus and even Nero had vast labors performed , but in vain . The Catholic popes , notably that enlightened Medici , His Holiness Leo X , then took over the unequal struggle with the potent Pontine Marshes , and finally in 1918 the Italian Government made elaborate plans .
