txt That Master exponent of great stagecraft and mass psychology , the National Socialist organization of Germany , staged two outdoor spectacles today that left upon all beholders an impression rarely equaled even in this new world of huge popular demonstrations . ? In the morning on the Zeppelin Meadow the district organizers of the party and their picked satellites , 160,000 in all  --  the 180,000 originally estimated are now admitted to have been 20,000 too many  --  aseembled in a great review . In the afternoon 60,000 Hitler youth brought here to be educated in devotion to the movement were gathered in the great stadium to present and share in a similar spectacle . It would be splitting straws bo say which was the more impressive . Chancellor Hitler addressed both , his voice being carried by loudSpeakers to the furthest ranks . District Leaders Hear Talks . ' And in the afternoon , while the taitler youth were thus imbibing the party spirit and tasting that sense of unity and mass strength that such a demonstration could hot fail to impart , there was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district organizers , the meat of the party 's minor kstrategists , a few lessons in party propaganda having a more subtle but no less strong effect . To these men drinking in every word of all they heard , Dr. Alfred Rosenberg , the Nazi foreign policy expert ; Gottfried Feder , vthe party 's leading economist , and Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels , its chief propagandist , spoke long and earnestly on the three present great German problems  --  foreign relations , domestic economic reorganization and the racial question . In every district , every city and every village , even the smallest , they will receive this viewpoint and almost all will accept it . And the burden of the talks was a defense Ind justification of the Nazi racial policy with regard to the Jews , a tolising invitation to the rest of the world to imitate it and a confident prediction that most of the ; world would do so . There is cited as supporting this Idea the presence here not only of a small delegation of Italian Fascisti but of four black-shirted British Fascists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said to be some Swedish FasLists , but they did tot parade. - The 33ritish group announced 9 , at it had been especially invited by the GerMan Government and was much in evidence . The Morning 's Spectacle . The men who this afternoon heard that National Socialism was coming to the whole world provided this morning 's spectacle . Each had brought with him his ten trustiest followers , the district flag of the party and its flagbearer . Together their uniformed ranks filled the great meadow . A band led every battalion , and 100,000 spectators , most of them , even the women , also in brown uniforms , looked on from the grand stand . A wide lane had been left open down the middle of the mass and three smaller lanes on each side . " When all had assembled there came from over the bank at the back and through the brown army to the front the massed Nazi colors , twelve labreast through the wide lane and in single file through the narrow lanes . The 15,000 flags made an impressive spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fervor scarcely equaled even by the previous frantic demonstrations for- him . Addressing them , his voice carried by loudspeakers to every corner of the huge field . He said : " We have found the key that for all time will close the door to our political enemies . This gathering is a visible demonstration , of the result of our fourteen years of effort . Our party has become the German State . It is now our duty to educate every German to be a citizen of that State : You must form an iron front that will encompass every German . Plans for Long Period . " We are planning for a long period . Just as we shall meet here two years hence , we shall meet here ten years hence and a hundred and even a thousand years hence . " From you , political organizers , will continue to emerge the nation 's leaders , chosen under the principle of authoritarian selection . I call on you , standing shoulder to shoulder , to make a vow that you will exert your utmost efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler youth this afternoon filled another great stadium from end to end and there were similar scenes as the boys formed a sea of faces and arms outstretched in salute . The boys had been specially chosen from the 1,500,000 in the junior organization and brought here from all parts of Germany , stood in long ranks , every boy with a knapsack and blanket roll on his shoulders and a long knife with the blade inscribed " Blut and Ehre " L " Blood and Honor " in his belt . When Herr Hitler appeared after a parade of flags similar to that in the morning the boys cheered so long and loudly that it was almost ten minutes before he could make himself heard . " You are the Germany of the future , " he said . " See to it that the same comradeship that now binds you together remains throughout your lives and that its spirit dominates the whole people . " You are the living guarantors of Germany 's future . Swear a vow born of faith that the German people shall never again be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers . Be strong , courageous and heroic . One discipline must bind us all together . " The Indoor Speeches . The renewal of the indoor convention was due rather to a desire to occupy the time of the district leaders , who are the really important persons in this gathering , while the Hitler youth had its show . Nevertheless , the importance from the party viewpoint of the three speeches delivered indicates that some opportunity for them would have been sought under any circumstances . Dr. Rosenberg was the first speaker , His theme was " The Racial Foundations of Our Foreign Policy " and his object evidently was to justify . the Nazi policy at home . " We are perfectly aware that in the entire world there is opposition to the new Germany , " he said . " It is not due to nor even to our enemies who have fled Germany and now seek to poison the world against us , but to a much deeper reason . " He proceeded to review Germany in the last fourteen years , the hardships she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedying them as seen through Nazi eyes . All these had failed , he said , until Adolf Hitler brought forward " the eternal values of German nationality . " Denies Return to Middle Ages . Germany , he declared , had not turned back to the Middle Ages in her national revolution , as had been falsely charged , but had taken up -a spiritual and political problem that fate in due time would also impose upon all other civilized nations worth saving . The nationalism of the nineteenth century , influenced by dynastic cabinet policies , trembled in the World War , said Dr. Rosenberg . The Socialist movement , once a healthy protest by a generation cheated out its heritage , was tried later but , poisoned by international phrases and Jewish doctrines , failed also , he continued , its mistake being that it appealed to one class to fight another class . " Today 's troubles of the entire world are nature 's revenge upon the intellectual attempt to violate her own law , " he said . " We have recognized that race has value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea can not but have its effect upon our foreign policy . " Says It Is Not Race Hatred . All really great poets , philosophers and thinkers have been racially pure , he contended , and he cited historic examples but with never a mention of Heine or Spinoza . Then he declared : " For Germany the German man must be the one to take charge of the nation 's fate . This is not preaching race hatred but the very contrary . It is preaching respect for race . " The British Empire rests on the racial superiority of the white man . We also understand the strong individualism of North America . To protect her race , which is predominantly English , German and Scandinavian , the United States has radically limited her immigration . Her laws now consciously encourage the immigration of AngloSaxons and Scandinavians and try to keep out the Eastern and Southern Europeans . And the United States even now has a racial problem  --  millions of Negroes and Jews in the East and the yellow race in the West . " All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with personal but spring from fateful necessity . All communities suffering the same way we have from the Jews would not have treated them as reservedly as we have done . " Stresses Jews in Professions . As an example of what Germany had suffered from the Jews Dr. Rosenberg cited the late Walther Rathenau 's supposed assertion that if the Kaiser had been victorious in the World War civilization would have lost its meaning . Then he dwelt upon the preponderance in Germany of Jewish attorneys , physicians , bankers and journalists as ail injustice inflicted upon the German people . " Our action in Germany today is not persecution of the Jews but restitution of elementary justice for the German people , " he declared . " Those who have tolerated the discrimination against the German people of the Versailles dictate have no right to complain of our alleged discrimination against the Jews . " We ask other nations : ' Is it to your interest to participate in a world boycott and political isolation of the German people that are calculated to lead to chaos in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved not only herself but all Europe from bolshevism , and to answer this service by attempting to destroy the new Germany would mean that the communistic peril would rise higher than ever . SE Ws Nazis Represent Peace . " Any weakening of present-day Germany means strengthening world communism , " he declared . " Every real Nazi is therefore a real representative of peace . " These assertions were typical of his whole argument : blood is higher than /gold , man is more than stock certificates , honors are worth more than the highest dividends ; it is not German nationalism that endangers peace but the speculations of profiteers who live on the ills of nations ; the people of the white race should stand together to emerge from the conflicts ahead ; we want the blacks to have their place in the world and the yellow races theirs , but we also want to keep ours . Gottfried Feder , State Secretary for Economics , discussed the rebuilding of Germany economically according to guilds and professions . The present situation , he said , was a chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He argued for the coordination of all groups and for the people of each group to concern themselves only with their own calling . Then came Dr. Goebbels , discussing the racial question in rela- ? tion to world propaganda . This National Socialist revolution , he said , was one of the greatest in history ; it was born of the Injustice of Versailles , with its consequences of ruin , unemplownent and , decadence , and had been carried out without bloodshed . Used ' Democratic Weapons . ' " We used the weapons and rules of democracy , " he said , " but only to bring It to a fall and to eliminate it from German life . National Socialism is consciously on the defensive against the excesses of liberalism . " He too reviewed the past internal dissension in Germany and declared it had been ended by Herr Hitler 's accession to power , and thus he came to the following : " Our National Socialism is no article for export but a typical German product . Nevertheless , it is a fact that concerns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness . The idea of political parties with equal rights has been overcome . " After thoroughly castigating the German emigres and denouncing the wrongs that he accused them of having inflicted on Germany , Dr. Goebbels proceeded : " But you can not understand this unless you pay special attention to the Jewish question . Foreign countries have criticized us Mijustly . We have been trying to solve the Jewish question practically . It was but one question of many and it is international Jewry 's fault that it has become almost exclusively the problem of world discussion . ' A Dangerous Game . ' " World Jewry , however , is playing a dangerous game , for this discussion has brought forward not only those who are against our action but those who are for it . " The Jew , according to Richard Wagner , is a plastic demon of decadence ; the Aryan is a creative person . " It is because we do not want to make the Jew solely responsible for the German crisis ariSl economic catastrophe that we have the courage to expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dr. Goebbels proceeded to cite by name Jews whom he said had defamed Germany before the world , mentioning especially Professor Emil Gumbel , Bruno Leasing and Ernst Toiler , and like Dr. Rosenberg he denounced Jewish " penetration " into the professions , especially into law , medicine and education . " Yet at the beginning of our regime we were reserved in our treatment of the Jews , " he said . " That more ' stringent measures were adopted is due exclusively to world Jewry . " He enlarged upon the " atrocities campaign " and the world 's reaction in the shape of a boycott of German goods . Blames Jews Abroad : " There , was nothing for us to do but start a counter-boycott , " he asserted . " If this meant material harm to the , Jews who remained in Germany , let them thank their own people abroad for it . Not a hair of a Jew was rumpled without reason . Our boycott was merely a , measure of defense conducted in a reasonable manner and without terror or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews is greater than any that has been shifted upon us , for now the Jewish problem has been thrown wide open for ? discussion by the whole world . ** clever German Jews realized quickly what this meant , but they could not prevail against the ' radical wing . " The Zionist Congress in Prague shows that the Jewish position of power is waning all along the line . The problem will not rest now until it has been solved by all the peoples of the earth . The solution will be found , however , if people , thinking clearly , recognize that it is necessary for their own well-being and for entrenching that well-being . " Already voices are becoming audible among all the nations . While people may not yet talk openly elsewhere , they are talking secretly , but all the more passionately . " The peoples who permit the Second and Third Internationals are conjuring up the very danger to themselves that we have just banned . The constantly progressing bolshevization of economy , politics and ethical life in its entirety is an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . Says Truth Is on Their Side . " Germany has overcome that danger . If our fight against anarchy has led to making the racial problem a world problem , that is something that we did not want for the moment , but we are quite satisfied that it should be so . Truth is on our side and is our strongest weapon . " Dr. Goebbels went on to say that the world propaganda against Germany would be met by world propaganda for Germany . " Germany has learned how to handle propaganda , " he said . " We shall yet succeed in convincing the world of the honesty of our actions and lead others at least in increasing degree to respect us . The truth is always stronger than a lie . We need not fear the verdict of the world in the racial problem and in the solution of that problem lies the future of our people . " Dr. Goebbels closed with a general invitation to foreigners to come to German By FREDERICK T. BIRCHALL . The more foreigners who came here , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a new Goebbels and a new mode of address . He had dropped the role of the fiery , impassioned orator and he read his speech slowly , argumentatively and impressively , as if he realized the type of men he addressed and their . readier response to argument than to oratorical fervor . And the response was all that the master propagandist could have desired . What he said today will be carried to every German hamlet and there it will become Nazi gospel . Thus Germany will be convinced that national socialism has done and can do no wrong . This next-to-the-last day 's celebration of the congress closed with a wonderful fireworks display that was witnessed y thousands , all of them paying guests . But tonight 's fireworks , impressive as they were , can scarcely have made so deep an impression as the daylight demon , strations , reinforced as they were by the verbal pyrotechnics indoors . Y to see the new Reich .                   @ @
