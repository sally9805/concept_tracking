Congress had an admiring eye cocked on Adolf Hitler 's great new system of Reich auto roads ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) when last June it directed the Chief of the Bureau of Public Roads to investigate the feasibility of building a system of toll superhighways for the U. S. But deliberate , slow-spoken Chief Thomas Harris MacDonald has had his eye on transportation realities , with which he has composedly rubbed elbows since he was appointed to his job 20 years ago in the WTilson Administration . This week , he gave his answer in a carefully documented 212-page report . <P> On the super-highway plan , Tom Mac-Donald decisively turned his broad back . Three north-south and three east-west roads , he found , could be built between now and 1945 . But the annual cost for construction , maintenance and operation between 1945 and 1960 would be $184,054,000 , while the average tolls ( at 1 a mile for passenger cars , 3.5 for trucks and busses ) would be $72,140,000 a year . The roads would not pay for themselves until 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a billion dollars . <P> But Tom MacDonald had another plan for which he plumped , a plan edited and approved by Franklin Roosevelt himself . The U. S. already has a good road system , and its arterial highways , touching every important centre of population , are not congested except near big cities and there only at certain hours . To guide Congress in speeding up inter-city traffic , MacDonald proposed a plan to improve and integrate 26,700 miles of existing arterial roads gridding every part of the U. S. <P> His recommendations , set out without an estimate of cost : <P> &gt; Straighten dangerous curves , widen roads where needed , lower steep grades , with the States doing the work , the Federal Government supervising . <P> &gt; Eliminate big-city bottlenecks by highspeed depressed or elevated highways straight through town ; by-pass small towns and villages . <P> &gt; Acquire all the rights of way needed with Federal funds , to be paid back by the States on easy terms over a 50-year period .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
