txt Money for Monkeys , Not for Babies . Four hundred thousand dollars for a new monkey house at Sixty-fifth Street and Fifth Avenue , while at Sixty-first Street and Amsterdam Avenue the New York Nursery and Child 's Hospital , far lack of funds , is likely to close its doors . The lion and the lemur can now have a place to rest their heads , which is more than can be said for some expectant mothers and sick children . For 112 years that hospital has served the mothers and children of the metropolis of the Western World , the peerless and magnificent City of New York . and as its portals slowly close it sees arising on the opposite side of town a model menagerie , the cost of which would have kept the hospital open for five years . Yea , verily the world is cock-eyed ! LOUIS C. SCHROEDER . New York . Nov. 3. 1934.
