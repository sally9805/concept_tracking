Seething with guerrilla warfare , Manchuria became Banditland in earnest last week . Civilian passenger and freight traffic was suspended on the Chinese Eastern , vital link in the railways that connect China with Europe . Among refugees pouring into Harbin , chief city on the Chinese Eastern , was Herr Kapitan Roland Strunk , grizzled veteran of the Imperial German Army . <P> " Gott im Himmel ! " he growled . " Everywhere the people of Manchuria are expecting Hell to break loose . The Chinese forces obviously are under foreign direction presumably Russian . Japanese occupation of the Chinese Eastern Railway right up to the Soviet border is inevitable . " <P> To direct the Japanese forces their Commander-in-Chief , doughty little General Shigeru Honjo who seized Manchuria in the first place ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) , hurried to Harbin . From this base three Japanese forces were advancing , nominally " to mop up the Chinese bandits. " but all toward different points on the Soviet frontier . <P> Under General Nakamura troops had pushed down the Sungari River to within 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontier . Eastward from Harbin and westward from Harbin other Japanese columns advanced out along the arms of the Chinese Eastern , which touch Russian territory at each extremity . Mysteriously a Japanese troop train was blown up on the C. E. R. , 40 Japanese killed , 100 wounded . <P> But Japan was by no means at war with Russia yet . A Soviet consular official , traveling in a special five-car train with Red Army guards , rumbled into Harbin , perhaps for a parley with General Honjo . <P> Just north of the city 4,000 Chinese soldiers , reputedly under General Ma , were routed by Japanese who took 500 Chinese prisoners , captured three Chinese armored cars , several pieces of artillery . Neutral observers agree that Manchuria 's peasants , terrorized by Japanese soldiers and Chinese guerrillas , have cut down their spring sowing to a point which guarantees a poor crop , threatens famine .
