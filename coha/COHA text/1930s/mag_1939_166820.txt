Lloyd 's of London rates have for many years been taken as perfectly sound indications of what horse would win the Cesarewitch stakes , what the weather would be like on Boxing Day , how long Noel Coward 's latest would run , whether or not Adolf Hitler would strike . Last week Lloyd 's offered a brand new type of insurance : against death or injuries inflicted on the King 's civilian subjects by the King 's military enemies . Rate for this air-raid insurance : 1 of premium for every 100 of insurance . Rate for London is the same as that for Leeds or Rosyth or Dover or anywhere else ; i.e. , Lloyd 's thinks that the attack , when it comes , may be general , not just local showers .
