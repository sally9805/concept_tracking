txt Senator Byrd , in a letter written to Secretary Morgenthau of the Treasury last Friday and made public today , listed eleven large corporations that , he said , would have paid no taxes at all on their 1934 earnings and dividend distribution if the Revenue Bill now pending in Congress had been in effect . He explained that he was unable to obtain the comparable figures for 1935 , and he hoped that Mr. Morgenthau could supply them . Mr. Byrd is one of the Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee who originally favored the Tax Bill as it passed the House . His opinion was changed by the more than a hundred witnesses who in testimony before the committee have opposed the measure , which would levy on undistributed surpluses of corporations . Saying that the list could be " greatly expanded , " he declared that the following " financially strong companies " which he said were now paying 15 per cent , could on the basis of 1934 incomes " completely avoid taxation " : American Telephone and Telegraph Company . American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Company . Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company . International Harvester Company . National Biscuit Company . National Dairy Products Company . Ohio Oil Company . R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company . Texas Company . Seeks to Guard Small Business The corporations that would have escaped all taxes were those that paid out dividends in excess of their net income in that year , according to Mr. Byrd . He added a list of thirteen corporations that had paid out practically as much as they bad earned in that year , he said , adding that their taxes under the pending bill would have ranged from onefourth of 1 per cent to 4.4 per cent of their net income . He included still another list of sixteen corporations whose taxes , he declared , would have run from 5.22 to 9.37 per cent of their net income . They were firms that paid out substantially less in dividends than they took in as net income in 1934 . " We must guard carefully against giving these large corporations a greater advantage and perhaps a stranglehold over their present smaller competitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am concerned about the application of the proposed tax policies to those corporations which now have large surpluses and strong cash or credit position . " We must make certain that legislation does not prevent the healthy growth and expansion of our smaller businesses by imposing a penalty upon them if their financial position and their business opportunities do not permit the payment in dividends of substantially all their profits . " Mr. Byrd Is convinced the administration bill would result in a heavy loss of revenue to the Treasury in the next fiscal year . Revenue aspects of the bill were the only grounds on which the Virginia Senator was in sympathy with it , and he now feels that the yield would be negligible as compared with the $1,100,000,000 income which experts estimate the Treasury would take in during the next fiscal year from existing taxes on corporate earnings . Members to Offer Substitutes Individual Senators will lay their proposals before an executive meeting of the Finance Committee tomorrow . Chairman Harrison has as yet given no indication that he will propose any modifications on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are opposed to the tax bill as it passed the House have not been able to get together on any substitute . Some Democrats are highly hopeful that Senators Harrison , Barkley and Black , principal administration supporters of the bill , will be able to offer modifications that will overcome sufficient objections to make it possible to report a bill to the Senate . The Senate membership is considerably less conservative than that of the Finance Committee . A bill once brought to the floor would have greater support in favor of the administration than is present in the committee . However , , Senators Byrd and King , particularly , believe they will have plenty of ammunition to conduct a fight on , the floor against any proposal that would tend to impair existing revenues . Byrd 's Views on Revenue Mr. Byrd assumes that one of the immediate effects of the tax bill would be to force all corporations , large and small , to distribute their entire earnings as dividends , at least during the coming year . 3e also takes it for granted that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , of paying out more in dividends than they earned , dipping into surpluses to provide income for their shareholders . If the bill had this effect , the government would take in substantially less taxes from the corporations . To offset this loss , the bill would repeal the existing exemption of dividends from the 4 per cent normal income tax . Although the Treasury had estimated that this repeal would bring in $300,000,000 in taxes from individuals , Mr. Byrd 's information leads him to believe that not more than $160,000,000 would be collected from this source . In addition he feels that large corporations would be able to finance capital expenditures for new plant and equipment out of reserves , while the small or new corporations , handicapped by the bill in building up reserves of their own , would be unable to meet the competition offered by their larger , older rivals . The greatest rallying point for sentiment against the bill is probably the fear that it would serve to entrench in unassailable financial positions for years to come those large corporations that have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Byrd mentioned at least one that has on hand , he says , a fund of $1,000,000,000 in reserve which would not be touched by the new bill .
