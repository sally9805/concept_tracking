A MAN AND HIS GOD A STORY BY DAVID THIBAULT B Acx in his childhood Easter had escaped church . Aunt Malissa Thomas was devout , but as cook at the big house her job ran seven days to the week . She tried sending Easter to church with various good sisters ; he became supple as a mink at squirming out of it . Those entrusted with him were not too severe ; they had their own churchly affairs to prosecute . When he grew into young manhood he and his cronies made sacrilege a tenet of their heady youth , basking in the radiance of hell-fire as right young men of all colors and ages have always done . This was natural , logical , inevitable . Life was beginning to be mighty good , and they did n't mean to forego any of it for the bleak promise held out by sorry-looking elders . The promise was offered with a good deal of hypocritical sanctimoniousness , and they knew it . But one by one most of Easter 's friends came into the church as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George and John Mack and Easter were the last to flirt with the idea ; all three of them strove to see light the summer Will Jones , Hezekiah 's brother , died of malaria fever . It was contemplation of his long illness and their own separate brands of logic which brought Easter and the Macks toward the fold . They talked it out one sunny afternoon , sitting on the ground at Easter 's house , their backs propped against the huge old " Matt Lewis " walnut tree . " I 's gwinna fin dis year , " George stated , grinning . " I got a ' sparience to tell ' em . " The others laughed , and John uttered a short , filthy word . " When I j'ins , " said he , " hit 'll be to get ' speriances  --  not to tell ' em . ' " We knows the onliest kind ov ' speriances you wants , " said Easter . " I reckon you does . Dey is de kind you wants , an ' de preachers wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George contributed . " Effen you mean wimmins , Troop do n't want ' em ; he gits " All dem preachers does . " John lacked his brother 's boldness but he had a slow , shrewd way of dealing finally with a thought . " Dey gits de cream an ' leaves us po ' sinners de blue-john . Dats whut I wuz sayin ' . Ai n't dat enough reason fo ' a man t'git religion ? " " Den dey mout be kinda right , " Easter said . " Effen dey is , a man as well to try to b'lieve all ov it he kin . " " Naw , " George interrupted . " Effen you straddles yo ' legs , you splits yo ' pants . Whole hawg or none , East . " But Easter was serious . " But sho ' null : listen heah . When I wuz jes a boy , I wuz listin ' cotton rows down in de lower field . I had a ol ' Brinley plow , an ' hit wuz a-runnin ' too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Dat wuz a team ! " breathed George . " I tried eve'y thing I knowed to take a plow outen de groun ' . Fust I shortened de traces till de single-trees wuz a-knockin ' de mules ' hocks . Den I short-coupled de clivis in de buck-head . Den I took up de back-band till it wuz nigh tore in two ? " " Did you bend up de plow-p'int ? " George asked . " Sho ' . I had dat big wrench , an ' I screwed it to fit de p'int an ' come up hard as I could strain . I did n't know whut to do . Den Mr , Henry he rid up . ' Loosen up de bolts dat hol ' de beam to de plow stock ' ? you know how he talk . I loosened ' em ' thout seem ' no sense in it . ' Now , ' he say , ' put a piece ov stick between de castin ' an ' de beam  --  at de back . ' I did , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did it he'p ? " John asked . " Sho'l " George said impatiently . " Do n't you see dat tipped de front ov de beam down an ' when de team pulled up on it , dat lifted de plow outen de groun ' ? It 's bleedged to , boy . " " Well I 'll be a son-ov-a-gun ! " " Now listen , " said Easter . " I thought I knowed it all , an ' heah wuz a little trick worth all I had . Whut effen dem preachers knows jes one little suthin ' whut we do n't ? ? jes like dat I done tol ' you . " That was the only way Easter could put it to them . But this incident had , for years , meant more than that to his own inside self . A man needs somebody at his back , his logic ran . Mr. Henry is fine to have in that position ; and everybody says God is a lot bigger than Mr. Henry . A few days after the three friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Staves was there , and he had just driven the score or more visiting brothers and sisters from the twelve-by-ten sickroom , as he always did . " Dad-damn it ! " the old doctor blazed , " You 're just standing around to see him die . He needs air . He needs nursing and care  --  not a cloud of black buzzards sitting around to see the circus ! Now git out  --  all but Sarah . " He detained Will 's plump wife for instructions while the solemn , outraged visitors of the sick poured out of the cabin . Among them was Deacon Troop . " How 's Elsie ? " Easter asked , falling in step alongside the man of God . " She fine , brother Easter . How 's crops up dis way ? " " Dey 's good . De worms come , but dey come too late to make no never-mind . " At the main plantation road Deacon Troop did not turn off but walked with Easter to the latter 's cabin . Easter gave his guest a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of the walnut tree . That is how beautiful and simple hospitality can be . They talked crops , fishing , meat curing , mule doctoring , planting fall turnips , and the weather . Then : " You knows , brother Easter , our big revival stahts at Zion Wheel Chu'ch de las ' Sunday in August . I hopes to see you young mens turn out strong . " " I 'll try t'come , Deacon . " " Jes tryin ' do n't put no meal in de ball . De devil he do mo ' dan jes try . " Easter had enjoyed his talk with Deacon Troop . He was flattered by the attention of this important man . There was also deep , subtle satisfaction in remembering that he had possessed Elsie before Deacon Troop married her . These emotions combined to sweep him into one of those sudden hurricanes of confidence to which unformed minds are subject . " Deacon Troop , ' t'ai n't no chance fo ' me . I got a double-actin ' mind inside my haid , whut thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forked tongue . " " Dey is always a chance , brother . Sinners is God A'mighty 's mainmast worry . You do n't plow yo ' crop effen hits clean , does you ? " " You plows hit when Mr. Henry tell you to  --  on dis plan'ationl But whut I means is . . . " With endless repetitions , haltingly and at great length , Easter told Deacon Troop about 01 ' Double-Actin ' . " I sees , brother Easter . You got two thoughts , an ' one ai n't good . " " Naw suhl I ai n't got but one : de one I wants to have . Den 01 ' Double-Actin ' hit come along an ' say whut is . " " I see , brother . Whut you got in you is God an ' de devil , a-fightin ' fo ' yo ' soul . I 's seed it time an ' again . I 's ' sparienced hit my own self . " " Dat whut it is ? " Easter asked ; and right then Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud Easter was afraid Deacon Troop had heard it . " Sho , brother Easter ! Hit 's well nigh a miracle . Ellen you gits up at de revival an ' tells yo " sparience , de sinners 'll come a-rollin ' . " For another hour Deacon Troop wrought seduction , playing crudely but not unskillfully on Easter 's fear and vanity . When the good man left , Easter stood committed to give his experiences as a battleground of good and evil . Through the weeks that followed he worked on George and John Mack , and upon his other friends . " May as well to save my friends effen I kin , " Easter said to himself , satisfied . Old Double-Acting , who was near the surface these days and as sharp as vinegar , said , " Hum ! You is gwinna make a narchul fool outen yo ' self , an ' you wants you plenty company ! " And when Easter and his friends finally did see the light , on the third night of the revival , they had plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three deep round the walls . The windows and the wide door were blocked with knots of intent heads , and a hundred men and women stood outside or sat in the wagons hitched to the trees . Easter , George , and John Mack sat miserably together near the tiny rostrum . For days they and other consequential sinners had backed and filled . Imported exhorters had worked on them . The good sisters had prayed over them . Deacon Troop , with an injured air , hammered ceaselessly . To-night 's meeting , he had told them , was especially for them . They had promised to come through . Troop himself was in the pulpit , shrewd , knowing more psychology than many who teach it  --  one of those wise medieval churchmen redivivus , abjuring any idea of fighting the devil with snowballs on abattleground so favorable to the enemy as a human soul . The deacon 's unctuous voice , the stifling air , and the yellow glare of the reflector lamps , wrought hypnotism . " We will now sing , an ' while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-callin'l All ready ? " " Been listen in ' all de night long , Been listenin ' all dc day . Been listenin ' all de night long , To heah some sinner pray . " " Come up , sisters ! Come up , brothers ! Do n't keep Jesus waitin ' ! " The hymn swung on . Now and then a convert leaped up , shouted , and plunged through the crowd toward the platform . Others resumed their seats after rising to shout . That was more fun because then their neighbors plucked at them , begging them to go forward to salvation . The penitents always did too , just as the plucking and begging and attention began to lag . Between George and Easter sat John Mack . He suddenly shot an elbow into the near kidney of each , leaped to his feet , and shouted , " Halleluiah ! I 's saved ! l 's saved ! " Easter and George exchanged a quick glance , and the latter instinctively plucked at his brother . " Sit down , you fool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a piece of " mother " in a jug of vinegar . " I 's saved ! I 's saved ! I feel de devil grab my coat-tail , but his han ' done slipped ! " John charged headlong to the mourner 's bench . The singing went on for an hour . Deacon Troop stopped it when he knew that all the fruit was garnered which would fall to this kind of trailing . The hush that followed had its own effect . As the first penitents rose to give their experiences , Easter and George looked at each other again . Neither smiled ; both of them were breathing hard , and Easter 's lips and the flanks of his nostrils felt stiff . Something had him . His gaze was fixed on the fat woman who was climbing the platform . She turned . It was Loda Green , his former wife , and Easter 's trance snapped like an icicle . Loda said God had come to her last June , and she had been in a trance for two weeks . Easter tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grunted , " H 'm . Loda an ' God bofe knows when is cotton-choppin ' time . " Loda rambled but her story was dramatic . While in this trance she had walked across hell on a hair , and her faith had kept her from falling off . Easter marveled more at the faith that hair must have had because Loda weighed all of a hundred and eighty now  --  another reason he was glad he was shut of her . " Brothers an ' sisters , b'lieve me , I ai n't got de smell ov burnin ' brimstone an ' sulphur outen my nose yit ! " she shouted . " Amen , sister Green ! " cried Deacon Troop , and all the congregation yelled " Amen ! " Loda had sprung her climax , and did n't know it . She wanted to keep hold of this attention she had gained , but all she could do now was to spread her arms and shriek , " Thank God I 's saved from hell ! " and then begin to shout . Suddenly George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God , but it 's gwinna take a man an ' a boy to do itl I 's rotten wid sin , an ' I knows it ! " He sprang toward the platform , and the crowd gave a full-throated shout . Here indeed was a hard-wood brand from the burning ! Sight of Loda had helped Easter cast off the mass-hypnotism that held them all . He had just concluded that church was as good as a honky-tonk up to a certain point , and that the methods of getting customers were the same : get the prospects worked up , irresponsible . But while promising less , the honky-tonk fulfilled more satisfactorily . . . . Easter was interrupted by a loud " Amen ! " He himself had shouted it in response to the telling opening of George Mack 's experience . " An ' brothers an ' sisters , I wuz in a saloon down on East Markham Street . An ' there I wuz . They had free stuff t ' eat , an ' I et . They had beer , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . It wuz pay-day , an de man he did n't mind how much we et long as we wuz drinkin ' beer an ' payin ' fo ' it . " The throng was so quiet that the little restless sounds of the mules tied out in the hitching grove came clearly through the pauses . It was the kind of story revival audiences crave  --  the Odyssey of a lusty sinner , giving them vicarious , unpunishable orgies under protection of the official business of salvation ; the oldest trick of sacred writers as it is the newest one of their descendants and heirs on Broadway and in Hollywood to-day . " Den ' bout quarterin ' - time my belly begin to rise . It riz till I fell outen de chair I was sittin ' in an ' fell down on de flo ' . All de mens stood round me , an ' dare I wuz on de flo ' . One man say , Whut he need is a drink . ' So dey took an ' poured more beer into me , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nuthin ' . It kept on a-risin ' , an ' den I knowed either I wuz bleedged to die or belch , one or de yuther . An ' I prayed to God A'mighty to femme belch ? " " Amen ! " yelled Deacon Troop . " Our brother 's on de flo ' in sin ! De devil is a-blowin ' up his belly like chilluns blows up a hawg 's bladder ! Will he die down dare on de flo ' in sin ? Pray , folks , an ' make ' ase doin ' it ! Do n't let ' im die , Lawd , do n't let ' im die ! " They sprang up moaning and stayed up to shout , " Do n't let ' im die , Lawd , do n't let ' im die ! " " Listen , eve'body ! " George waved his arms . " I ai n't through ! " " Let ' im talk ! " Deacon Troop 's voice vibrated with holy ecstasy . " Let ' im speak an ' reveal . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin ! Maybe de Lawd done heard us po ' sinners prayin ' ! " " Listen ! " and this time George quelled them . " Dare I is , an ' I ai n't got but one bref left in my mis'able body . Den it got kinda dark , an ' de devil say in one ov my years , Use dat bref to breve , ' cause dat 's whut brefs is for . ' An ' in de yuther year de Lawd God A'mighty Hisself He keep a-shoutin ' , ' Pray ! Pray ! Pray ! ' An ' ? betwix bole ov ' em is me , an ' I 's sayin ' suthin ' different from all ov ' em . I 's a-sayin ' , ' Nigger , effen you do n't belch wid dat las ' bref , dey 'll haul you to de graveyard . ' . . . " " Salvation ! " yelled Deacon Troop . " Salvation ! Whut 'll it be ? Will our brother breathe with de devil , or pray with de Lawd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amen ! " The congregation rocked and moaned . ' ' Pray with de Lawd , brother , pray with de Lawd ! " " Listen ! " George shouted again . They were instantly silent , so expectantly , so cannibalistically still that George was startled into naturalness . His arms fell slowly to his sides . " Which 'll it be ? " thrilled Deacon Troop 's tense whisper . " Well , " George spoke in his every-day cotton-patch voice . " To tell de natchul troof , hit wuz all three , an ' dey all come at once . But I always gives de credik to de Lawd . " Then another man sprang up , shouting , and fought his way toward the pulpit while the house cheered . He leaped to the platform and raised his arms .. . and Easter realized , with the down-swooping of spirits as of one hit in the pit of the stomach , that this man was himself ! " Salvation ! " shouted Deacon Troop , and the congregation took up his cry . " Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a fightin ' - place fo ' pow'fuI large spirits ! Listen at me , whut done happened to mel " He shook them with the vehemence of his narration , telling how God and Satan battled within him , pulling his easeless soul first this way , then that . How , as he lay for a week in a trance last May , an angel appeared and handed him a double-barrelled shotgun . And the angel said this dispute had gone far enough . " Take dis heah gun , " said the angel . " ' T'ai n't but one ba 'll loaded , but you do n't know which ' un , an ' hit 's got sixteen number eight buckshots an ' five drams ov black powder . Cock bofe hammers . You isgot to shoot first at de Lawd , an ' den de ba 'll dats lef you got ta shoot at de devil ! " Easter had them and they had Easter and the church was charged to bursting with the thing that had them all . " Lawdy , Lawdy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prayed Deacon Troop . Half a dozen women sprang up , shouting to be allowed to throw themselves between that shotgun and the Lawd . The hammer clicked . The jubilations of the crowd drowned the report of the second barrel , the contents of which presumably abolished Satan from Easter 's soul forever . Easter was so dazed by his success that , heedless of plucking hands that sought to guide him to the mourner 's bench , he fought back to his old place on one of the pews . " Let ' im soak ! " commanded Deacon Troop . " He done hoed a great row fo ' de Lawd ! Let ' im soak in righteous sweat . He 'll come up when de comin ' - up time come ! " The performance went on . As soon as Easter was seated he heard 01 ' Double-Actin ' say , " Umph , umph , umph . You is de heaviest liar fo ' yo ' weight in dese bottoms . You ai n't said nuthin " bout me , an ' dat double-actin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done said whut dey wanted you to say , an ' hit wuz all lies . " Easter felt still inside , and his knees were trembling . He suddenly had utmost contempt for his Iies , and for Deacon Troop for having sponsored them and for being so glad about their results ; and right there , while the crowd still sobbed to his fervor , whatever it was that had been lighted in him died forever . He was not sorry . It was good to be his natchul self again , and to take a sinner 's interest in the slender , pretty gal who was getting up to testify . He looked her over appreciatively ; when his eyes rested on her young breasts and well-turned ankles , he was ashamed of himself as he had not enjoyed being for ten years . . . . A nice gal ca n't keep a man from seeing what she 's got . . . any more than a brash gal wants to . . . a man ought n't to bug his eyes out . You can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This girl did n't . Easter had seen her resist the urgings of a group of elder sisters for some minutes . Then old Aunt Minnie Graves had patted the girl 's shoulder and said something , and Easter had heard a clear young voice reply , " All right , effen you sez I got to , go ! " Her performance was a timorous , colorless affair after Loda , George , and Easter . She finished and went decorously to the mourner 's bench . Right then that mourner 's bench looked different to Easter . He got up and made for it . George and John , already seated with the newly righteous , plucked at him , indicating seats beside themselves . Doggedly Easter went where he had pointed himself and sat down by that girl . She drew her clean , blue skirt closer to give him room , and Easter saw how small her hand was and how slim the fingers of it and how , despite their slimness , a dimple came over each knuckle when the hand was relaxed . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was still shaking with fright , and her smile was a faint bright shadow and her eyes fell before his at once . But Easter did n't feel masterful after that . His own joints trembled . He swallowed his Adam 's apple ; sitting there became exquisite agony . He tired himself straining to keep from touching her on her clean , cool dress , though he would have made a whole cotton crop in Johnson grass , and then given his half away just to put his knuckles to the blue cloth of her skirt . " Dat 's de way de po ' ol ' devil felt when you shot ' irn wid dem buck-shots , " said 01 ' Double-Actin ' . " Hah ! Hah ! Hah ! " The meeting broke up at midnight . The men toted the chairs out and replaced them in the wagons . Easter , active in this work , strove to trail the new girl to her folks . He saw her join Aunt Minnie Graves and a very tall gray-haired man who reminded him of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were evidently very well thought of . While Easter gaped , wondering if he would have the courage to offer assistance with their chairs , Annie C. caught his sleeve . " You gwinna he'p me in my wagon ? I come up wid de Slaughters . " " Yeah . An ' dat ai n't all I means to do to you , gal . " " Do n't talk like dat heah ! " Annie was fearful but she could n't keep from laughing . " Pussen listenin ' at you would n't never know you jes done new got reli-gion . " " New paint hit rubs off mighty easy , " Easter rejoined . " Comin ' down to-night , East ? " Annie asked softly . " Ca n't . " " All right . I 'll look fo ' you when I secs you . " Easter and the Mack brothers sat on the steps of the deserted church long after the mutter and laughter of departing worshipers and the lonely wagon-sounds had died under the stars . They were somewhat ashamed of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed something that might be easier under cover of this warm darkness . John only was his natural , gently ribald self . " Trouble , East , you an ' George held out till you had to come up : dat made you come up too fur . " " You talks like you was n't de first one , " Easter began . " John charged up dare like a boar-shoat through de briars , " said George . " Sho ' , I didl I went up easy an ' I kin come down easy . You an ' East is gwinna waste a lot ov time comin ' back to sin whar you b'longs , an ' you gwinna have plenty misery . But you watch met I 's a Sunday-Revival-Christian ; dat 's what I is , an ' it ai n't gwinna hurt me no matter whicha way I slides  --  back'ard or fo'ard . " " When I come heah to-night , " said George musing , " I had my story all made up  --  jes like I tole it . I wuz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up , an ' whut I made up lies turnt into de natchul truf . " " Yeah . " John freighted the word with derision . " ' Bout all de truf in it wuz dat you has got drunk an ' you has et too much . " " Well , " George was complacent ; " I is seed dem saloons whar dey gives you free grub . But I ai n't sho ' puff been in one . " " Whut I said was de natchul trufl " Easter protested , and wondered why he had uttered such a lie . " Well I is a son-ov-a-gun ! " murmured John . " When you had any trance las ' May  --  dat lasted a week ? " " Well , it seemed like it . Anyhow , I got suthin ' in my haid dat double-acts like dat shot-an ' - powder ho'hn Mr. Jeemes gim me ? " " It 's jes a June-bug done crawled in whar yo ' brains ought a he . " John got up and dusted the seat of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief . His greatest difficulty , after choking off his reason , lay in trying to reconcile the acts of his fellow-Christians with their protestations and dispositions . If believing was as big a thing as they said , why did n't it mean more to them on week days ? He took his trouble to Deacon Troop . The holy man found Easter less important now that he believed the convert safely added to the saved ; and he was frankly amazed at Easter 's simplicity and ignorance . " Sho ' , de good brothers an ' sisters do n't do all dey know dey ought to . But de Bible itself say dat man is proned to sin , " he explained . " Dat kivah de p'int , brother ? " Easter said it did , but it did n't . He had not been comparing Christian tenets with Christian conduct , and condemning sourly . His puzzlement struck through to something fundamental . He could not explain to another precisely what he meant , but 01 ' Double-Actin ' put it clearly enough to Easter himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like you b'lieves it hurts to smash yo ' finger wid a hammer , or like you b'lieves it 's fun to be wid a gal  --  dey would all go round a-singin ' an ' a-prayin ' , an ' a-bein ' good . But is you seed any whalin ' difference twix dese folks an ' sinners ? " When his night to visit Annie C. came round , Easter wrestled with the temptations of the flesh , and won . It was raining torrents , Annie lived three miles across sticky " buckshot " fields , and he was tired from nights of revival ecstasy , his imagination full of the picture of that new gal . It seemed better to sit with his door open and listen to the rain zipping through the leaves of the Matt Lewis walnut tree . " Maybe , " he muttered when , not long after dark he was preparing for bed , " maybe I is gettin ' a little better . Fust time ever l 's skipped goin ' to Annie . " " Yeah , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rennin ' on all dis evening ? " " Dat new gal I sat by on de mourner 's bench de night I come through . " " Unhuh . She fadin ' Annie , an ' you think it 's yo " ligion fadin ' sin . " That focused Annie C. strongly in Easter 's hot imaginings . He stood in the middle of his cabin , holding the shirt he had just stripped off , feeling that here was a show-down between his religion and all that Annie C. stood for . It had not been Christian of Double-Actin ' to point out so clearly that another gal is better defense against the weakness of the flesh than brand new faith . And the whole welter of emotions brought the sure charms of Annie compellingly before him ; of Annie waiting in her cabin . Easter stood so still a mouse came from its hole by the hearth , and he could hear its phantom squeakings above the drumming of the rain . Suddenly he scrambled into his shirt , snatched his hat and his oldest jumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Hit ai n't late , " he muttered , setting his face toward the rain . " You see ? " said Double-Actin ' as Easter slithered through the mud , " When it come to a show-down twix Annie C. an ' de Lawd you sho ' make it rough on de Lawdf " When time came for baptizing the revival converts , both George and Easter backed out and spent the long sunny afternoon at Easter 's house playing casino with Annie C. and George 's wife . Everybody knows that a deck of cards will damn you as far as you can hear a bullfrog on a May night ; and as it was Sunday besides , this was epical back-sliding . That happy Christian , John Mack , was baptized . Later he dropped by Easter 's and took a hand in the game . " Lawdy , look at Johnnie ! " exclaimed Annie , half fearful of such impiety . " I do n't b'lieve you wuz sho ' null babtized . " " Ax Deacon Troop . I cotched me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' I made one ov ' em fin him in de calf ov de leg . " But Easter lacked John 's lightness of spirit and George 's seasoned boldness . Nobody but himself and 01 ' Double-Actin ' ever knew how close he came to getting converted again . It seemed like the ' spariencc he had reeled off so glibly was coming true for him . Certainly there was a mighty seesawing in his soul throughout the last days of the revival . Every time his fears drove him toward repentance some earthly fact sprang up to turn him back . He noticed , for instance , that many of the most devout church folks had grassy crops , and that they had the usual troubles a man has with his women and his children and his boss-man . And it was inescapable fact that shouting sisters pretty often forgot just what kind of ecstasy they were supposed to cultivate , and scattered a good deal of sunshine by starlight . Unctuous brothers knew how to improve their opportunities on those long night trips to and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the word of confirmed sinners like Hezekiah Jones to corroborate his own observations . " Folks gits worked up at dem meetin 's , " Hezekiah would say . " Meat 's cheap when a big revival is goin ' on . " But under it all beat the thought , " What if the preachers are right ? And I find it out too late ? " He labored hard , trying to overlook the delinquencies of the godly in field and bushes , hoping thathe could pump up enough belief in God 's servants to create belief in God . Going at it the other way round was utterly impossible , because as soon as his reason came out of the lethal chamber of those meetings , it promptly vomited all that had been force-fed into it . George went through something of Easter 's trials , but one day , smiling his sunniest , he said he reckoned the Lawd had cut him out for a sinner , and it would be sin to change the Lawd 's plan . And religion never bothered George after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so one Saturday noon , as they sat at Easter 's , eating lunch . They planned to visit Will Jones , who was still low-sick , after the meal . " ' Ligion sho ' ai n't made no difference in you , Johnnie , " Easter said . " You is de same , but twict as wicked , seem like to me . " " I 's different , all de same , " John assured him , grinning . " You ' member once I said de preachers got de cream , an ' we got de blue-john ? Well , I wuz a mis'able sinner den . Now I sez we gits de cream , an ' you po ' sinners gets de  --  Listen , East ! " A single stroke rang out from the bell of Zion Wheel Church , half a mile away . Wide eyed they listened . Another stroke . It was tolling all right . " It 's Will Jones ! " breathed Easter . " It 's tonein ' fo ' Will . " They counted the strokes aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will wuz ' bout a year younger'n me . How old is you , East ? " " Twenty-six . " Easter , John , George , and a new hand named Pink Dawson dug Will 's grave under the supervision of old Pike Stafford , a seasoned expert . They cleared away the sumac bushes and briars not far from where Aunt Malissa Thomas lay . It was a solemn business . " Will , he de fust one ov our ol ' gang to go , " said George . They were down through the leaf mold and the sandy loam now ; the light clay subsoil was like old gold . " You forgits Aif 's Jim , " replied John , and they snickered in spite of themselves . " Straighten yo ' side , Easter , boy I " admonished Pike Stafford . You is undercuttin ' . Dat sof day make yo ' spade drif ' . " " All right , Uncle Pike , " said Easter respectfully . The old man 's insistence on perfection reminded him of John Key . Easter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , wondering if they had religion . When Easter himself had it , as for whole hours at a time he believed he had , then it seemed to him these friends probably had it too ; but when he was in a rational , backsliding mood , he was certain they had n't . " Brother Dawson , " George asked politely , " is you gwinna make a crop ? " Pink Dawson was a lean , reddish-brown man , bold-spoken , swift , with lines of suffering about his mouth . " I 's done asked yo ' boss-man fo ' one . Who gwinna work his land  --  now ? " He tapped the floor of the grave with his shovel . " Ai n't no tellin ' , " replied George . " It 's a long time to cotton-plantin ' . " " It 's a good cut ov Ian ' , " Easter said ; " an ' de house is warm in winner an ' hit 's tight . " " It wuz fresh kivahed with new boards dis spring , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de boards . Did n't I , Uncle Pike ? " " Folks do n't onderstan ' gittin ' out boa 'd timber like dey uster , " said Pike Stafford irrelevantly . " Dey 'll use anything dat will split dese days . Put de dirt back farer dan dat , John . Folks will be a-standin ' right whar you pilin ' it . " " Will , he made a good crop ? ' fore he got sick , " Easter told Pink . " I got a good notion to speak fo ' dis Ian ' , " said the newcomer , and the three young men urged him to do so . " Umph , umph , umph , " grunted old Pike Stafford . " A man 's grave ai n't dug ' fore we grabs fo ' his lan ' , an ' he ai n't in it fo ' somebody grabs fo ' his wife . " The remark had nearly too much point because Sarah was known to be fairly gay even in Will 's lifetime . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The others thought well of this apology coming from a hold-spoken man . Pink was advanced toward their acceptance . " I do n't mean no harm nuther , " rejoined Pike . " When you gits old as me , you knows do n't nobody mean no harm : dey jes does it . " That was forty years beyond the others . So they snickered decorously and deepened the grave . All was ready that afternoon when the long queue of wagons , each freighted with a dozen or more mourners seated on straight-backed chairs , wound its way through the fields to the graveyard . The plain pine coffin was in the first wagon . On it was a saucer of salt and a great wreath of Jacqueminot and Marshal Niel roses brought down to Will 's house and placed there by Mr. Henry and Miss Molly . The men who had dug the grave , aided by Deacon Troop and Hezekiah , the dead man 's brother , took the coffin from the wagon . " Save dat saucer ! " warned Deacon Troop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense abject poverty teaches . All who were there understood and approved . Easter took the saucer of salt and the flowers from the coffin . Three to the side , with plow-lines taken from the gear of the teams , they lowered Will Jones into the earth . Deacon Troop opened his Bible and read the burial service in his strong voice . There was no sound while he read . He closed the book , turned up his face and prayed . When he concluded , " Amen ! " breathed through the packed folks like a single muted note from an orchestra . " Let us sing , " said Deacon Troop . " Pitch it , brother Hezekiah . " Hezckiah gave them the first line in his faultless tenor : " Did n't my Jesus arise ? " They caught it on the swing , a hundred and fifty men , women , and children blending their voices in effortless har-mony : " And ascend up on high ! " The words and the music were borrowed from another race . The wailing acknowledgment of mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sarah gave a piercing shriek , stiffened , and would have fallen if Hezekiah and George Mack had not caught her . " Watch outl " cried Deacon Troop . " She mout try t'jump into dat gravel " Other sisters keened in sympathy . Sarah hung shrieking between the two men . " Lemme go wid ' iml " she cried again and again , struggling . " I do n't wan na stay effen you kivahs up WiIll Lemme got Lemme gol " She surged desperately toward the open grave . George and her brother-in-law did their best to calm her . Easter grieved with Sarah while he and John Mack filled the grave . But , " Huml " said 01 ' Double-Actin ' . " She ai n't sho ' null tryin ' to hurt herself . ' Member de night you rassled wid Elsie Lewis ? " Easter remembered , guiltily , and he half agreed when Double-Actin ' added , " Sarah jes like Elsie wuz dat night : she makin ' a good show to Took at , but she holdin ' back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Pike finished off the mound and someone handed to Easter the plain flat pine stake upon which Mr. Henry had lettered the name and the date in carriage paint . Easter held the headboard for Pike to drive . " Turn hit roun ' , boy ! Turn hit roun ' so de writin ' is out . Do n't want folks a-straddlin " im to see who he wuz . " Easter turned the stake , and Pike drove it down with the back of his shovel . Deacon Troop said a short prayer , they sang another hymn , and before it ended George and Hezekiah got Sarah into the wagon . The crowd thinned as wagon after wagon filled and lumbered homeward . John Mack , Pink Dawson , and Easter , who had offered to return the shovels borrowed from the gear room , were last to go . They shouldered their implements and slowly followed the wagons . Looking back , Easter saw a mocking-bird flutter to asassafras sprout for a closer inspection of the new mound . Next day Easter sat on his door-block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such handy accomplishments , and his bachelor years had proved their usefulness . Across half a mile of dust-green cotton fields he could see the new roof of the house that had been Will Jones , and beyond that the small duster of trees in the Bill Jones slough . Easter cut off three yards of number eight thread with his pocket knife , threaded it double through his needle , knotted the end into a monkey-fist big enough to fill a pipe . He thought of Will , and of the others he had grown up with . It was hard to be dead on a day like this , with high white thunderheads sailing across the sky , and cotton beginning to pop open on the sand-blows . It was hard to lose somebody like Will you had grown up with . It must be hard on Sarah . He looked at the roof of her house floating over the cotton . She was there , alone , grieving . She had certainly carried on strong at the grave . Easter wondered if a woman really would jump in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to see it tried . . . . Even if they did jump in , he 'd bet his bottom dollar they would climb out mighty quick if you started filling in the earth . Easter measured off six yards of cotton sacking . He wondered if Sarah had n't had her thoughts too yesterday . She and Will had n't got along together so well . Sarah was pretty lively and devilish . Will did n't know anything but work . Well , Sarah had something to be lively with . She was built like Annie C. , but she was a little taller , and darker ... and she was over there now , alone , grieving . Will had been sick a long time . Easter rolled up his work , got his hat , locked the door . " Whether I is a chu'ch member or no , " he muttered , " I kin try an ' comfort deco in misery . Pat po ' gal maybe ai n't got no wood split up fo ' her cookin ' . " He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Double-Actin ' . " Why must you lie even when you is by yo ' self , in broad daylight ? ' Tai n't no ax you is gwin ' ovah dare to use  --  effen you has yo ' way ! " There was no one in the house , but the door was unlocked , and when Easter pushed it open after knocking , he saw a good fire in the fireplace . " Dat mean she dose round , or ai n't got no sense , " he thought . All his life the ways of a woman with a fire had puzzled and disgusted him . In the yard was a pile of freshly split cottonwood logs . Easter supposed Hezekiah had done the work . It was the season , between laying-by crops and cotton-picking , when the hands laid in their wood for winter . Easter had neglected his own wood getting . He decided to fill in the time while waiting for Sarah by inspecting the trees in the Bill Jones slough  --  the thicket named after the father of Will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He skirted the outlying blackberry brambles , eyed the tall trees , speculated on their splitting qualities . Without warning he came to a little red-bud bush in thick weeds . Under that bush were Sarah and Deacon Troop . They had not seen Easter . He stopped in his tracks , his pulse pounding . Then he turned softly and walked home . He was by turns indignant . hysterically amused , and chagrined when he thought of Sarah 's perfections . Of one thing he was certain : he would broadcast and embroider this story to his friends . " Jes ' wait 'll dat Troop come at me again ' bout j'inin ' de chu'chl " Easter muttered ; and imagining the deacon 's future discomfiture helped him somewhat to forget his own . Under all , was envy of the holy man 's forehandedness and enterprise . But this was one secret Easter kept to his dying day : not through fear of Deacon Troop , for once his mind was made up , Easter carried a resolution through ; but because subtle things happened inside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , Mr. Henry was already on the seat of judgment : the door-block . His gelding was tied to the fence across the road , and Mr. Henry thoughtfully whittled the butt of a riding switch he had cut . Eight or ten hands sat on plow beams , or flat on the earth , their backs against the walls of the gear-room . Easter sat down beside George Mack . The Deacon began an oration . " You know me , Mistuh Henry . I 's been is dese bottoms long as de biggest mud-turkle in ' em . You knows if I say I 'll handle a crop I 'll sho ' handle it . " Mr. Henry whittled his riding switch . He seemed to be no more moved for or against the orator than was the heart-cypress door-block on which he sat . " Whut I 'd like to do is to jes ' take over Brother Will 's crop  --  an ' his sto ' bill too ov course . An ' jes move right in an ' work dat same land dis next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident that Deacon Troop would have preferred tackling the white man with no audience present ; but the audience was there ; the deacon lived five miles away ; and he had to cut his suit to fit his cloth . Unfortunately the audience was made up of young brothers whom he especially desired to keep impressed and , consequently , he was more or less jumped into being a trifle too loud , a shade too eloquent . " You knows my wife , Mr. Henry , Elsie Lewis . ' Tai n't a better workin ' woman in dese bottoms , if I does say it myself . So , " Deacon Troop turned to the audience , " Mr. Henry know me an ' he know my wife . Sarah , she want us to move right in with her . Whut I wants to do now is jes staht callin ' myself yo ' han ' , Mr. Henry , and draw myself some rations an ' git to work . Whut de answer ? " Those who knew this white man well knew it long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whittling . " You had a crop here about twenty years ago , and Miss Ruth had to hire it picked . " " But Mistuh Henry ! I wuz jes a boy den ? " " You made three crops on the Jack Mitchell place  --  that cut by the old gin-house . You were no boy then . It was always in the grass . You 've been with Mr. Keatts six years . He says he 's running you off this year because you are too busy preaching and running after women to work in the field . " Mr. Henry stood up and brushed the shavings from his thighs . " No . I do n't want you . " " Umph , umph , umpht Jes listen at Mr. Henry ! " said Deacon Troop . He half turned to the audience , striving to carry off his discomfiture as a joke ; but his face went lean with chagrin and disappointment and with the hurt to his dignity . Later , walking toward home with George and Easter , the deacon became very grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I is black . But Jesus sees us . I forgives him ! I forgives him ! " The incident worked down deep in Easter . He knew that in judging Deacon Troop as a share-cropper and field hand Mr. Henry had been just . But Easter liked the picture Troop made of a kindly , righteous , and holy man . His own recent observations , facts , and Mr. Henry successively spoiled that picture , and , spoiling it , took one more comfortable thing out of life . Away from thesebrutal factors Deacon Troop could quickly rebuild that image . It pleased Easter better to permit this ; he even resented the harshness of Mr. Henry which had obscured for a time what Easter wanted Deacon Troop to mean to him . It was like having someone paint a favorite cooking pot white , or like plowing with a turning plow that threw the dirt to the left . That is why Easter shut his teeth against telling anybody what he had seen under the red-bud bush in the Bill Jones slough . He was never further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecatory and kindly , cornered him and upbraided him for his sins . For then the picture Easter liked was sharpest . For himself , with the unwelcome aid of Double-Acting , he reached a comfortable conclusion regarding religion : " Deacon is right . You ca n't serve de Lawd an ' de devil bofe an ' have no rest . But ' tai n't easy as jes sayin ' it . Run out de devil , an ' he do n't stay run out . Run out de Lawd an ' He come back like a aggravatin ' chicken you shoos offen de porch . A man as well to leave ' em bofe inside ' im . Den dey balances each other like a sack ov cotton an ' a three pound pea on a good scale beam . "
