Last week Nazis in Berlin prophesied a quiet , leisurely two or three weeks for turbulent Europe . Reason : Fuhrer Adolf Hitler , after entertaining Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia for four days , after getting the signatures of Estonia and Latvia to non-aggression pacts and honoring the Latvian Foreign Minister with the Grand Cross of the German Eagle , and after commuting to ten years ' imprisonment the death sentence of a young woman who murdered her illegitimate baby , headed south for his Berchtesgaden eyrie . <P> Later the Fhrer , in one of his musical moods , showed up in Vienna to watch Richard Strauss celebrate his 75th birthday by conducting his Symphonia Domestica . The Fhrer also heard a new Nazified Strauss opera Der Friedenstag ( Day of Peace ) and honored Composer Strauss with a banquet lasting until 3 a.m . Next day the Fhrer saw a comedy called He Wants to Have a Spree . Next scheduled speech of the Fhrer : July 19 , at the launching of a new German warship .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
