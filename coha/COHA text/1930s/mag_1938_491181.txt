RINEVE E3 OgRET GARR= R EBUILDING America . . . on the ruins of the past a new structure . . . the edifice of recovery . . . the temple which , when completed , will no longer be a temple of money changers or of beggars , but rather a temple dedicated and maintained for a greater social justice , a greater welfare for America . . . the habitation of a sound economic life . . . stone by stone . " ? Words from Fireside Chats , first series . It is unseemly to higgle over the price of a temple . Nevertheless , there is a bill . For national government , such as it was in the ) ruined order , the last bill that was presented to the American taxpayer was for the fiscal year which ended on June 30 , 1933 . The amount of that bill was $4,681,300,000 . Signed : Herbert Hoover . On the margin of that bill President Roosevelt wrote : " For three long years the Federal Government has been on the road toward bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the Congress the profound effect of this fact upon our national economy . It has contributed to the recent collapse of our banking structure . It has accentuated the stagnation of the economic life of our people . . . . It is too late for a leisurely approach to this problem . . . . We must move with a direct and resolute purpose now . The members of -. / Congress and I are pledged to immediate economy . " The latest bill presented to the American taxpayer for national government , in the new temple , is for the fiscal year ending . Jane 30 , 1938 . The amount of it is $7,408,600,000 . And on the margin of this bill the President writes : " In my judgment the expenditures of the national Government can not be cut much below seven billion dollars a year without destroying essential functions or letting people starve . " But this is the recurrent annual bill only . There is , besides , a five-year bill . On June 30 , 1933 , ending the last fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On June 30 , 1938 , ending the fifth fiscal year of the new order , the national debt 7 will be at least $37,603,600,000 . To say " at least " is a necessary qualification because the debt is steadily rising and the increase each year has been greater than was forecast . The Bill for the Temple 00 WE have the money cost of the tem- ple to date . An increase of more than fifteen billions of dollars in the national debt ; an increase of more than two billions of dollars a year in the cost of conducting government . The temple is not finished . On the fifth anniversary of its beginning , certain serious structural defects appear . A great deal of the work may have to be done over . It may be well that people do not know beforehand what their temples are going to cost , for if they did , there might be fewer sublime ruins in desolate places of the earth where once had been wealth and surplus . However , the miscalculation in this case was very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than government in the old one . There was a pledge on it . The pledge was to perform " an immediate and drastic reduction of governmental expenditures , by abolishing useless commissions and agencies , consolidating departments and bureaus , and eliminating extravagance  --  to accomplish a saving of not less than 25 per cent in the cost of Federal government . " If that pledge had been kept , the current bill for national government would he $3,510,975,000 , instead of $7,408,600,000 . The miscalculation , therefore , appears to have been appromately four billions a year , or more than 100 per cent . Leave now these sordid money matters . Leave them to the tax collector . Cost , after all , is relative . You can not say a thing is dear simply because the price is high . You have to look at what you get . We might have known that to build such a temple would take both money and time beyond the estimates . How much time would it take ? In the last Fireside Chat of the first series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two years or three years . " Four years . .. . Five years . . . . On the fifth anniversary is it permitted to ask what there is to show for an increase of two billion dollars a year in the cost of government and an increase of fifteen billions in the national debt ? What of the goods received ? How do they compare with the under-takings ? The undertakings of the New Deal were so many all at once that its laws had to be passed without debate , sometimes unread , just as they came from the White House ; and yet that seemed to be all right at the time , because everyone knew how ideal the intentions were and that everything that was done , even though it might have to be done over , would somehow come under one or more of the three R 's , standing for recovery , reform and retribution . In that order of the R 's , recovery was the first imperative . It requires no explanation . There had beenfour years of frightful economic depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery around the corner , we should have to go the other way and meet it head on . The question is : Did we meet it. , did it meet us , or did the New Deal produce it ? And if the New Deal produced it , what produced it in every other country at the same time ? The great depression of the period 1929-32 was a world-wide disaster . The recovery likewise was world-wide . Both movements were of a tidal character , touching all countries . - What might have happened in this country alone , in place of what did happen , is something you can never prove . They may believe who can that without what the New Deal did to save us we should have gone down , down , down , after 1932 , with all the rest of the world going up . However , that was not possible . And the fact is that through five years of world-wide recovery this country was a notable laggard , standing all the time in sixth or seventh place . Retarded Recovery Ta king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1937 ? fifth year of universal recovery  --  was nearly one third greater than it had been in the year 1928 , which was the peak year of predepression time . In Great Britain alone it was more than one fifth greater . In this country industrial production came to a top in 1937 at approximately the level of 1928 . But to have equaled the year 1928 we should have been producing not the same quantity of things but a greater quantity , because meanwhile the population had increased by nearly ten millions . That is to say , at the top of the recovery in 1937 our total production of things was less per capita than in 1928 , Irons which it follows that at the very best in 1937 there was relatively less to be divided than in 1928 , and then at the end of 1937 there was actually much less , because production by that time had fallen in a headlong manner and there was a new depression , not a world-wide depression this time , but . one of our own . All through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top in 1937 , there was a sign of weakness in it . The high output was of such things as the economist calls nondurable goods , meaning the things we make today and consume tomorrow . Of durable goods , meaning such things as machinery , power plants , industrial buildings and houses , the great deficit that had accrued in the depression years of 1929-32 was never made up . This means that in order to reach again the level of 1928 in the production of nondurable goods for immediate consumption , we were using very largely the equipment we already had and wearing it out . As far as we did that , we were eating up our tools . Through five years of recovery , ending suddenly in another depression , it is doubtful if the total wealth of the country was increased at all . Considering what our wealth and resources are , considering our famous superiority in the possession and use of mechanical power , considering our record , to have held sixth or seventh place in a world-wide recovery was to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the principal countries to make a worse statistical showing was France , and for what it is worth , the fact may be noted that France was the only one that tried to copy the New Deal . We speak of recovery . It may be that what we are talking about is re-viva ' . It may be that we have had no recovery at all , only revival . The difference is to be explained . Merely to make today all the things we may consume and enjoy tomorrow is not enough to employ our full man power . It takes , it may be , only two thirds of our power to do that . What , then , of the surplus third and how shall that be employed ? The use of that surplus third of our power is to bring the future to pass , if we have a future . Its use is to create the further means to further plenty . Otherwise it can not be employed at all , unless , being content with the means we already have and with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exertions , thin down the work , share it around , and embrace the static life . That would mean a standard of living that could rise no more and one that would tend always to decline . What we have not recovered  --  what we seem to have lost for the first time in our history  --  is a reckless passion for the future . Hitherto we had lived in a world we were overtaking . To the future we sacrificed the present . If now we begin to live more in the world we have , it is the future that must be sacrificed , and the new political delusions will be such as rise from ideas of ever-normal plenty , balanced abundance , planned economy , maximum rewards for minimum exertions , social security , stability  --  all ideas of a finished world . Some will say the New Deal 's recovery program was interfered with . One of its principal instruments was the NRA , and the Supreme Court destroyed it . The answer to that is that the total recovery from the low of 1932 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NRA . The NRA period was the one flat spot in those five years . It began in the middle of 1933 and ended in the first third of 1935 . When it ended , all production , in mining , manufacturing and agriculture , was lower than when it began . Not only was it lower ; it was declining . The Way They Planned It Next in the order of the R 's was reform . That is , it was next when it was not first . There were times when the enthusiasm for reform was so high that if a little recovery had to be sacrificed for it , so much the worse for the wicked . Reform had many aspects , and that was the case because in a free state of capitalistic society there were so many evils to be abolished . To abolish them all at once , first capitalism had to be tamed and shaved , clothed with a social-mindedness and taught to think of people before profit ; and then the entire economic life of the country had to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more power , besides not to be afraid , and so , as the President said , there had to be " drastic changes in the methods and forms of the functions of government . " Fighting a fight with one hand while making weapons with the other . You can see what a job it was . And what was to come of it ? The causes of depression were to be removed forever . The annual product of wealth was never again to be divided by the blind ferocities of competition , but hereafter by a benign , just , ' far-seeing intelligence . Supply and demand were to be brought into perfect balance ; no more ruinous overproduction , nor ever again scarcity , but always exactly plenty , and the money in everybody 's band to buy it with . The comprehensive word for all of this was " stability . " There would be stability of money , stability of prices , stability of production and distribution , stability of employment , stability of purchasing power , once that had been reapportioned according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability of economic happiness , with security . Well , stability turned out to be only something the chart makers at Washington had made a drawing of . In the last third of the fifth year , just when the floor of minimum wages and the ceiling of maximum hours were about to be added to the temple , suddenly The stock market crashed . Industrial production collapsed . Purchasing power de-dined . The number or unemployed began to rise by The most startling fact about this . inexpected convulsion was that never in the history of free competitive capitalism had there been one of equal severity , not even in the year of the great panic , 1929 . In twelve weeks more than one third of the total average value of New York Stock Exchange securities was wiped out . From the high point of the year , steel production fell 80 per cent . The Iron Age said : " No recession in steel production has ever come with such rapidity or gone to such depth within so short a. span . " ' The buying of motorcars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last two months was faster than in the corresponding worst two months of 1929 . At first the temple builders refused to believe it . When in early December , at . a White House press conference , a newspaper correspondent asked what was to be done about a recession that was getting worse every day , the President said : ' ' It , is an assumption . " At another press conference he said the trouble was fear and asked the correspondents to make note of the fact that he charged . the newspapers with spreading fear in the country . When the correspondents asked him what the newspapers could gain by doing that , the President said : " That is what I have been wondering . " Where was that far-seeing intelligence that had been seated in the temple , to read the omens , to know everything beforehand , to plan ? I t no more knew than any other that these things were going to happen ; nor did it know why they happened . Nevertheless , Secretary Ickes and Assistant Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wicked rich , the monopolists , the corporate earls , the ducal overlords , the first sixty families of economic royalism , had done this thing to them again . These enemies of the New Deal had made away with the New Deal 's prosperity . In their insatiable greed for profit , they had devoured the feast the New Deal had spread for the people ; and at the same time they were engaged in a conspiracy to destroy profit and to ruin the country , themselves included in it , in order to wreck the New Deal . Confusion In the Temple The people knew better . Their reaction to these gross absurdities was disagreeable . Was that all the New Deal knew about its own stuff ? Where had the temple watchmen been all that time ? In any case , how could the economic royalists have done it again if they were following , not leading , as was to have been the new way of things ? And they were more confused by what followed . The economic royalists denounced in one week by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the temple to discuss ways and means of mending prosperity in collaboration with the Government . The temple minds were thinking Frantically . That was announced each day in the newspapers . But the news of what they were thinking became each day more bewildering . The General Motors Corporation had laid off 30,000 employees . A Senate Committee on Unemployment sent for the head of the General Motors Corporation to ask him why he had done it . ? He said it was because people had stopped buying motorcars . The Senate Committee asked him why he did n't cut the price so that people could buy more . Ha ! Why had n't he thought of that simple thing ? A few hours later the President was saying to representatives of the motor industry and to the newspaper correspondents that one trouble was that the motor industry had been selling ears too fast , by the installment method , under high-pressure salesmanship , thereby using up the buying power the New Deal had distributed among the people . That was a strange point of view . Never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself when it was putting posters in every post office urging people to buy electric ice boxes , oil burners , new wall paper , plumbing , anything they wanted for their houses , on credit , and the Government would guarantee their accounts at the bank . The New Deal , in fact , went into the installment finance business itself , directly , and is in it still , with a Federal corporation to promote and finance the installment buying of " electric apparatus , equipment and appliances . " That is the Electric Home and Farm Authority , a credit agency , capital $850,000 , incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia , entirely owned by the Federal Government . The SIxty.Familles Theme Along with everything else in this strange debacle went agriculture . There the New Deal , with elaborate measures , with all of its power , and with enormous cash subsidies out of the Treasury to raise the farmer 's buying power  --  there , in fact , it had guaranteed stability . Now comes the Secretary of Agriculture , saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . The demand for Federal aid is being augmented daily by a variety of factors , notably an impending drought in certain areas , sagging farm prices , the rapid mechanization of agriculture and the industrial recession . Distress is growing rapidly and neither local nor Federal agencies have the means to cope with it . " Stability , exit ! The third R was for retribution , and retribution was for the economic royalists , those brigands of the skyscrapers , whose greed and stupidity had been responsible for our 1929 " descent into economic hell . " ( Line from Fireside Chats . ) They were to be cast out . No place was reserved for them in the temple . Indeed , they were forbidden to enter the premises . If they knew how to be good , or if they were willing to learn , they would be permitted to follow . Never again should they lead . " They must either follow , " said the President , " or shut up shop . " It is irony that shapes this sequel . When Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio to tell the people the wicked rich had done it to them again , they were obliged to admit the total failure of retribution . Mr. Jackson said : " Certain groups of big business have now seized upon a recession in.our prosperity to liquidate the New Deal . . . ? The blunt truth is that today we have in command of big business , by and large , the same Bourbons who were in command of the defeat of 1929 , and who since then have learned nothing and forgotten nothing . When the Government through the RFC saved the capital structures of big business from going through the wringer it also saved many incompetent managements . " lad Mr. Ickes said : " Out of their divinely claimed genius as managers of private enterprise , the sixty families led the American people into the worst peace-time catastrophe ever known . He is referring here to the world-wide depression that began in 1929 . Then the disillusioned people changed the Government . The new Government bailed the sixty families out of the consequences of their own mesmeric miscalculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their capital was invested from going through the wringer . . . . And what happened ? . . . First , the sixty families . . . proved to have learned nothing nor forgotten nothing since 1929 . . . . Second , the sixty families . . . make . . . a threat that they will refuse to do business at all unless the President and the Congress and the people will repeal all that we have gained in the last five years . " . . . The truth is even more . Not only did the New Deal save the economic royalists and restore to them their capital and their profits ; it suspended the one law that makes free competitive capitalism work to the greatest good , the law that obliges it to sacrifice its own economic royalists , the remorseless law that makes it pay for its own mistakes . What is that law ? It is an implicit law , saying that those who take the profit shall also take the loss . Every capitalist knows that painful law , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worse than if it did , may he even fatal . Yet knowing it , the individual capitalist is seldom willing himself to embrace it . Only necessity can make him do it . What the New Deal did was to annul that necessity . Take the obvious ease . In his book , On Our Way , the President writes : " It . is no exaggeration when I say that if the economic conditions of the winter of 1932-1933 had continued , practically every railroad in the United States would have been in the hands of a , receiver in a short time . " Therefore , the Government intervened and loaned enormous sums of public credit to the railroads to save their capital structures . The Railroad Hobgoblin In the first place , the economic conditions of that winter were not going to continue . The tide had already turned in the whole world . In the second place , suppose every railroad that was insolvent had been let go into receivership . Where would the loss have fallen ? Not upon the savings banks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were the creditors , they had been receiving interest , not profit , and in the end they should all have been not only safe but better off , because the railroads were easily worth their bonds . The loss would have fallen where it belonged  --  that is , upon the stockholders , who were the owners . They preferred that position and took it by choice , because they wanted the profit  --  not interest , but dividends . They had had their profit , and having had the profit , they were obliged by that first implicit law of capitalism to take the loss . No railroad would have stopped running . But a great deal of old and profitless capital would have been rubbed out , new capital would have come in for the sake of profit again , and the railroad situation today would not be the nightmare it is . Exactly this had happened again and again in our railroad history . // At one time more than three quarters of our total railroad mileage was in receivership , and all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loss was private . The general situation in the winter of 1932-33 , to which the President refers , was that after four years of terrific and necessary deflation a very great mass of obsolete , inflated and imaginary capital was about to be wiped out . It should have been wiped out . The entire economic body would have been hardier and healthier afterward . But the New Deal was obsessed with the idea of using its new and magical money power to restore all prices and all values at one theatrical stroke . The President writes that . at this time he had in his mind a picture " showing two columns , one represent , ing what the United States was worth in terms of dollars and the other representing what the United States owed in terms of dollars . The figures covered all property and all debts , public , corporate and individual . In 1929 , the total of the assets in terms of dollars was much larger than the total of the debts . But by the spring of 1933 , though the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assets had shrunk to below that of the debts . Two courses were open : To cut down the debts through bankruptcies and foreclosures to such a point that they would he below property values ; or else , to increase property values until they were greater than the debts . " That is to say  --  one way was to write down the debts ; the other way was to write up the assets . The New Deal resolved to write up the dollar value of the assets . The way to do that was to cheapen the dollar in which the assets were valued . Hence , debasement of the currency , called dollar devaluation , and then credit inflation , called reflation . Devaluation of the dollar involved repudiation of the word of the United States Government engraved upon its bonds . The Sixty  --  Cerer Dollar The New Deal , to he sure , was thinking first of the little man . The difficulty was that you could not give the little man a sixty-cent dollar in which to price his assets , thereby easing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a dear dollar for the economic royalists . That simply would not work . All assets , big and little , had to be written up in terms of one common sixty-cent dollar . Thus all capital structures were saved  --  that of the farmer along with that of the economic royalist . Well , since the debts the United States owed it owed all to itself , and since it was all writing anyhow , what difference did it make whether you wrote down the debts or wrote up the assets ? The difference is important .. By writing up the assets the New Deal saved intact that very great mass of obsolete , inflated and imaginary capital that was about to be wiped out and ought . to have been wiped out  --  and we carry it still . It is all there on our backs . This alone would have been enough to limit recovery . For the devout and faithful , the roll of disappointments is heavy . Something must have been wrong from the beginning . Was there something wrong , perhaps , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a graphic description of it in the process of building . He spoke of the pillars , especially four . The first was the pillar of relief . The nature of relief was such as had never been imagined before . There was unemployment relief , of course , amounting at length to an obligation on the part of the Government to provide a job for every person who wanted one and could n't find it . Debtors came next ; but as debtors were relieved , so also were the creditors . Mortgagor and mortgagee were both relieved . One could pay his mortgage ; the other could get his money . The Government itself took over farm mortgages . Banks were relieved of their frozen assets . The railroads were relieved . Home owners were relieved . No one was forgotten , or if one had been , he was to telegraph the Government about it . " I make the further request , " said the President , Fireside Chat No. 4 , " that if there is any family in the United States about to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family should telegraph at once either to the Farm Credit Administration or to the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation in Washington , requesting their help . " And along with everyone else , the economic royalists were relieved , for otherwise , as the New Deal itself now says , they would have had to go through the wringer . The Pillars of the Temple But this relief pillar was not to be permanent . It was for the duration of the emergency only . It was nothing more than a great prop . When the temple was finished , it could be kicked away , or perhaps let remain as an honorable reminder of what a wreck was there when the New Deal began . However , on the fifth anniv , , ersary it is still there , and indispensable . It has turned out , in fact , to be the most durable pillar of all . No one seems now able to imagine the absence of it  --  the absence , that is to say , of Federal relief in all bard situations . The other three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money pillar , the AAA pillar and the NRA pillar . The money pillar is still there , supporting all the capital structures that were saved at the time , the good ones and the bad ones together . What else it supports is not so easy to say . The belief that it was supporting stability and constancy of purchasing power has just been rudely shaken . One has almost forgotten that when it was erected it was expected to support our foreign trade . That was absurd ; nobody mentions it any more . It could not support retlated domestic prices and at the same time uphold our foreign trade . The AAA. pillar is both there and not there . It has a curious history . The Supreme Court ordered the first one out because it was not in right constitutional style . It was taken out , but another one very much like it was immediately substituted , and it was to support the same thing  --  namely , the purchasing power of the farmer . And yet it has never been quite right . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the builders , and together they have reshaped it from year to year , while in place . The NRA pillar was leaning badly and would perhaps have fallen if the Supreme Court had not knocked it down . The builders were both angry and relieved at that . They had been having a lot of trouble with it , and although they hated to see it knocked down , still they never tried to make a substitute for it . They made instead several small pillars in the same design , as , for example , the little NRA for bituminous coal . Now there was one peculiarity about all of these pillars ; and it was that each one of them had a separate principle , if you call it so , or a separate purpose . Furthermore , their purposes were in conflict . It was us if several groups of craftsmen were working separately , each group intent upon its own pillar , quite regardless of the others . The President had some glimpse of this . In Fireside Chat No. 4 , he said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may disturb the progress on the pillar next to it , the work on all of them must proceed without let or hindrance . " But it is evident that he was thinking only of interference on the job , not of interference in principle . What was the idea of the money pillar ? The idea of that was to restore all prices and all values to somewhere near the predepression level , or to write up the assets instead of writing down the debts . Right or wrong , that was a policy in itself and could be so regarded . The effects would be horizontal ; all relations would be restored to what they were before . So good . But what was the idea of the AAA pillar ? The idea there was to alter relations in a radical manner by producing a vertical price effect . Specifically , the idea of AAA was to redistribute the national income in a way to give farmers as a class a much larger share . The means were mainly three , namely : One , to restrict production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make agricultural prices go up faster than industrial prices ; two , a tax upon consumers , the money to be collected by the Government and handed over to the farmers ; and , three , cash subsidies out of the United States Treasury . Thus , farmers as a class were going to receive a larger share of the total national income . It was to be transferred to them in a wholesale manner by statistical measure . Transferred by whom and from whom ? By the hand of the New Deal and from that part of the population that is urban and industrial . But you can not increase the total buying power of the nation by taking income from one class and giving it to another , nor can you transfer buying power from the industrial part of the population to the agricultural part without a great row . Hatching the Blue Eagle You may think that was a problem . It was no problem at all . Those who said it was a problem were the wicked scoffers , who , as the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pigs . There was a fourth pillar coming . It was just arriving . That was the NRA pillar . What was the idea there ? The idea there was to shorten the hours of labor and raise wages throughout industry , so that the industrial class could afford to buy the food the AAA was raising the price of , and more of it than ever before , because , if the hours of work were shortened , more people would have to be employed in the world of industry . Certainly you could not raise wages without at the same time increasing the cost of manufacture . But that was all right . In another Fireside Chat the President said : " The proposition is simply this : If all employers will act together to shorten hours and raise wages we can put people back to work . No employer will suffer , because the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same amount for all . " True , in that case , the industrial employer would not be hurt . But what about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise ; as costs rise , so prices will rise . Therefore , everything the farmer buys from industry will go up and the advantage he has been guaranteed by the AAA will be annulled . It was not the idea of the AAA that , as between the agricultural part of the population and the industrial part , buying power should be balanced . The idea was that the buying power of the farmer should be increased . Thus , NRA was undoing the work of the AAA . You have , therefore , in the money pillar the idea of producing a horizontal price effect with intent to restore all economic relations to what they were in predepression time ; in the AAA pillar the idea of producing a special vertical price effect touching only agricultural commodities , purposely to change economic relations ; and in the NRA pillar the idea of producing a compensating effect touching industrial prices only . The construction was intellectual . Brains and theory did it . No journeyman hand could have done it . The hand would know better . Handcuffs From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple might have stood , as many temples do , askew , out of plumb , held together by the grace of good intention . What wrecked it was the only consistent thing about it , and that NN .1-an original economic fallacy rising to the proportions and power of a great popular delusion . A demon was imagined . The name of it was production . Let go and running free , production devoured first its own wage slaves and then itself , hut not itself entirely until it had wantonly ruined the paper wage structure from which we derive our sustenance , the paper price structure that supports our prosperity , and the paper capital structure that keeps us rich . To save these precious structures , to save people from want in the midst of plenty , to save , it may be , civilization itself , chain production down ! The only concession to common sense was that the word over was often written before the name of the demon , thus : over-production . The consequences of this delusion were disastrous and defeated true recovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous deficit of things , every kind of thing . Yet a surplus measure of grain , a surplus pig , a surplus ton of steel or a surplus bolt of cloth was regarded as a social calamity . You can hardly think of an economic law enacted by the New Deal that did not intend , directly or indirectly , to limit the competitive production of the things that satisfy human wants . Why ? Because it might hurt wages or prices . Through the AAA the Government paid farmers to destroy the existing surplus and thereafter to limit prod ul - tion , and this was to raise the cost of food , while the Government at the same time was borrowing money to feed the unemployed . In the NRA scheme , the antitrust laws were suspended in order that producers might legally enter into written agreements , with the Government and with one another , to limit competition and limit production . The hours of labor were limited . The speed of wheels was limited . Even the hours a day a machine could work were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then all producers had to raise wages alike and raise prices alike in order to pay the higher wages , and price cutting was forbidden . Big industries were cracked down upon for breaking faith . A little tailor in Jersey City was put . in jail for pressing a pair of pants at less than the fixed price . Two very serious consequences were unnoticed at the time . One was that every existing plant , factory , store , or what else , became a potential monopoly , because competition could not increase . The other was that all the weak , marginal , high-cost producers were sustained , which meant that industry and business were frozen on a high-cost plane ; never could the cost of production have fallen if the Blue Eagle had continued to rule . Well , but that was the ring in the I demon 's nose . High wages , high costs , high prices , limited competition and controlled production  --  that was the formula for recovery . The President himself expounded it . In a speech at the Jefferson Day dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Other individuals are never satisfied . One of these , for example , belongs to a newly organized brain trust  --  not mine . He says that the only way to get full recovery is to lower prices by cheapening the costs of production . Let us reduce that to plain English . You can cheapen the costs of industrial production by two methods . One is by the development of new machinery and new technique and by increasing employee efficiency . We do not discourage that . But do not dodge the fact that this means fewer men employed and more men unemployed . The other way to reduce the costs of industrial production is to establish longer hours for the same pay or to reduce the pay for the same number of hours . If you lengthen hours you will need fewer workers . If you choose lower wages for the same number of hours , you cut the dollars in the pay envelope and automatically cut down the purchasing power of the worker himself . Reduction of costs of manufacture does not mean more purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite . " An Economic Riddle This was perhaps the most illuminating single statement ever made on the subject of New Deal doctrine . It reduces our economic history to the terms of a riddle . Only ten years ago our European competitors were sending commissions to this country to See why it was that with the highest standard of common living in the world and consuming more goods than any other people , still we could compete in foreign markets against low-wage countries . They found out why . By technology , by method , by a prodigal use of mechanical power , we were continually reducing the costs of manufacture and at the same time raising wages . In seventy-five years the buying power of wages had increased threefold . Wages were high , by comparison with wages anywhere else  --  the highest in the world  --  and yet the actual labor cost was low because the productivity per man and per man hour was so much higher . If this be not true , then the 25,000 , - 000 motorcars you see in the highways are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highways are not there . We are still going about with the horse and buggy on dirt roads . But the perfect answer was unexpected . It came from the President himself . When at last the New Deal faced the fact of a new depression , one of its own this time , the President , thinking of things to do about it , thought of a national rehousing program to be sponsored and stimulated by the Government . He unfolded the plan serially at the White IIouse press conferences , and came always to the one great obstacle . The cost of building was too high . That was it . Not only were building-material prices too high ; wage rates in the building trades were too high . Prices must come down . If they did not come down obediently , the Government would drive them down ; and it would be well at the same time for labor to see that if hourly wage rates were reduced , there would be more building and more work and larger total earnings for labor from a building boom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But why  --  if " reduction of costs of manufacture does not mean more purchasing power and more goods consumed " ? Why  --  if " it means just the opposite " ? The Vice of Thrift Here it might seem that what had been the only consistent thing about the temple was beginning to give way , meaning by this the delusion that unlimited production is a social curse . It was probable , however , that an inconsistency occurred only at that point of reality where the President was thinking of a new pillar , to be called a rehousing campaign . Elsewhere it seemed to be holding . One special product of the delusion was the idea that there was too much saving in the country and not enough spending . Little people going to the savings bank with their money  --  that was perhaps all right , except that if they had the social security to which they were entitled , they would n't need to do it . But when the great corporations practiced saving , by withholding their profits instead of paying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and socially wrong , because everyday purchasing power was thereby reduced . And what did such great corporations do with their undistributed profits ? One of two things . Either they built up enormous idle reserves , which gave them too much financial power , or they used them to build more plant and equipment , the effect of which was both to multiply their profits and to cause excess production . " The use of undistributed profits must . be controlled , " said one of the brain trust . " Any system of planning would have not only to hedge them about with restrictions , but to direct their uses  --  if by that time it had not been made impossible for them to be accumulated . " In his message to Congress , January 3 , 1934 , the President himself referred to " the unnecessary expansion of industrial plant " as wasteful and antisocial , and said , " We must make sure that as we reconstruct our life there be no soil in which such weeds can grow again . " Industrial-plant expansion meant more production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of obsolete capital producing at higher cost . The demon again ! Whereon it was that . after NRA had failed , the famous law taxing undistributed profits was enacted . A corporation that did not pay out its profits in dividends was obliged to hand as much as one third of them over to the Government . There was revenue from this tax , to be sure , but besides the revenue from it there was the calculated effect that it put a new ring in the nose of the demon . It heavily handicapped what the President had called " the unnecessary expansion of industrial plant , " out of profits . There are two ways in which industrial capacity may be expanded . One way is with new capital ; the other way is to do it with profits , and for the latter way American industry was famous in the world . Expanding the means to further production out of the profits of past production is a certain way to reduce the cost of manufacture , obviously , for the reason that on the money you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to pay neither interest nor dividends . At a very rough guess , one quarter of the total existing industrial capacity of the country was so created . And it is enough more to say of the principle of imposing a punitive tax upon undistributed profits that it would make another Ford impossible , who did it all out of profits ; it would make another Chrysler impossible , who crashed the motor industry with a. shoestring of capital and rose to third place in it by putting back more profit than he took out ; it would make another Fink impossible , who during the depression created the independent Federal Steel Company , or another E. T. Weir , who years ago started out to compete with United States Steel with a capital of only fifteen thousand dollars and built theWeirt on Steel Company . And again , like the NRA , the undistributed-profits tax tended to create monopoly by discouraging new competition . Recovery in Reverse In these ways that have been set down the New Deal has crippled the free competitive system that was working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better than any other system that was ever known . In these ways it has been destroying what was unique in the American economic system . Either it did not know what it was doing , or did not know what else to do , and borrowed at random from the Old World systems , social security and unemployment insurance from one , planning from another , parts of the corporate-state principle from another , and so on . For five years there has been no American system . What we have been watching is the experiment of trying to make captive capitalism work , conducted by a Government that only half believes in it and yet has not the daring to destroy it . How badly was the American system working ? In his budget message to Congress at the beginning of the year , the President said that in order to bear the increased cost of Federal Government , now above seven billions a year , the country would have to increase its national income to a figure higher than it ever was before . Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Deal the national income , valued in sixty-cent paper dollars , was never within fifteen billions of what it was in the year 1928 , valued in 1110-cent gold dollars  --  with now ten million more people to produce and divide it . However , there is a new depression ; and it may be well to remember that depression is the New Deal 's meat and drink .
