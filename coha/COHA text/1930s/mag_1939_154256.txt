Safe as a county fair was aviation 's winter meet , the All-American Air Maneuvers , at Miami last week . A half-dozen speed events went off like buggy-races . The ships that flew in them were not freakish rocket ships , but ordinary sport and businessmen 's airplanes . At the finish at week 's end , no open speed records had been broken , but no flier had been killed or maimed , no ship demolished . It was aviation 's first big safe and sane get-together . <P> Most impressive and significant event of the week was the light plane cavalcade of some 550 Pipers , Taylor Cubs , Aeroncas , mobilized by Major Al Williams and his flying staff of the Gulf Oil Corp . ' s aviation department . On the opening day 325 of these little fellows flew into Miami on free gas and oil from the East , the Middle West and the Southwest , settling like flocks of gulls on Florida 's sands . By the meet 's end most of the stragglers had joined the first 325 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low fuel or motor trouble , none suffered serious mishap .
