OFFICE HOURS A STORY BY ROLAND ENGLISH HARTLEY T HE house seemed very empty and the days very long now that Cora was n't here . Before , when he was not busy in the office , he could go back into the other rooms and talk to her  --  see her , at least , or hear her moving about ; hear her singing sometimes . Now that she was gone , the house was woefully empty and still . He could n't blame her for going . He knew that it was his own fault ; if he had been more of a success she would n't have wanted to go . But her new happiness hurt him , now that she had found a work and a life in which he had no part . She looked so much younger and fresher these last few months ; her smile was so much brighter ; she had a new sure poise of her head . And it all said to him , " You could n't do this for me ; but see , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flat immediately after their marriage . He had been out of dental college only a few months then , and this was his first office . He remembered how proud they had both been of the gleaming sign on the wooden pillar at the head of the steps . When it was first put up they had gone out hand in hand to look at it . " Dr. Howard Burney , Dentist . " " It makes me feel as if I had a famous husband , " Cora had whispered proudly . And when they came in she had taken his face between her hands and kissed him . The sign had had to be replaced once since then . It had grown tarnished beyond the redemption of polishing , and the screws that held it had rotted away . In those days very few dentists had offices downtown . It was mostly neighborhood practice . People liked young Doctor Burney , and he had done fairly well . Of course , he and Cora had their anxious times . " We have to expect that at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together over the economies they had to practice . Life was very good , with its hopes and its faith . Before many years he began to plan his move downtown . Larger office buildings were going up ; street-car service was better ; people did n't think anything now of the trip downtown . In fact , they began to think that a man who kept his office in the neighborhood must somehow be a little less valuable than one who had to be approached by means of an elevator and whose windows looked far down on crowded streets . It was slow work saving for that move . The longer the move was delayed the slower the saving for it became . Each year Doctor Burney thought , " If only I had made the move last year ! " After ten or twelve years it was clear that he could n't take this old chair and instrument case into a shining new office . He would have to have a wholly new equipment . That made the move an even more serious problem . After another few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would have to have new things for the waiting room too . Now , at forty-nine , Doctor Burney thought that perhaps he himself was a little too old and worn to fit in with the brightness and briskness of downtown . He smiled a little - wistfully to himself when he thought of equipping an up-to-date office , with " Dr. Howard Burney " written across the door , and then having to provide a new alert young fellow to take the place of the man , rather gaunt and gray and stooped , whom he saw when he looked in the glass . Cora had always been very patient " Oh , what would we do with a million , anyway ? " had been her heartening slogan through all the first years of struggle . Then when things settled down into a meager but sure competence she began saying , without the gaiety now , " Do n't worry . We 're getting along . " That was when they still talked of his going downtown . They could n't relinquish the idea that all this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . It was only in the last five or six years , perhaps , that they had given up hope . They did n't talk about it . They scrupulously avoided the subject . But they both ' mew , now , that the move would not . he made . For his part , he had grown reconciled to the neighborhood practice . There was nothing exciting about it , to be sure ; but nothing arduous , either . There were many hours with no claim upon him at all . Often a whole half day . He could go out into the back garden with Cora and putter around . They could hear the bell out there . If it rang they both hurried in . He would go into the office before Cora opened the front door . Then he heard her bright voice and heard her lead the way along the hall to the door of the back parlor , his waiting room . lie would wash his hands and for a few minutes move instruments noisily about on the glass-topped table . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting room , where the light had to be kept burning at midday . " Good morning , " he would say briskly . " Will you come right in ? " There were a few of the old neighborhood families he could depend upon . He had worked for the young people when he first came here , and now he was working for their children . Sometimes these friends sent him newcomers in the district . He was getting along all right . For one thing , the rent was low out here . And he and Cora lived simply . They were getting along . He could n't understand it at all when Cora said she wanted to find something to do . After the first moment of astonishment , what he felt chiefly was indignation . It was like a criticism of him ; and he had always done the best he could for Cora . Lord knows , he did n't spend anything on himself ! " But it is n't just the money , Howard , " she tried patiently to explain . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now 's about the last chance to climb out . In a few more years it 'll be too late . " He murmured something about the possibility of a move to a downtown office next year . " Yes , yes , " she said quickly . " I do hope you can ! But meanwhile I 've got to do something for myself . I ca n't stand this emptiness any longer ! " He went into the office to think about it . ' Whenever there were anxieties he could best come to grips with them here . He sat on the little chair by the table with the mirror in the corner , where the ladies sat to tidy their hair before going out . He leaned his elbow among the scattered combs and brushes , and tried to think the thing through . Of course Cora was younger than he . She had been such a child when they married ! And she bad kept her youth miraculously through these years . There was gray in her hair now , but her skin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cora . She was so fine-looking ! And what a poor life he had given her . Shut up here in this dreary flat . " Emptiness , " she called it . Well , it was , in a way . For him , she had filled it and made it completeness . But evidently he could n't do as much for her . . . His eyes grew a trifle moist . lie sat there a while longer , then he went out to Cora in the dining room . " I feel badly about it , Cara , " he said gravely . " I feel as if it were my fault . . . . But of course , you must do just as you want . " She laughed gaily . Already the glow of the adventure was upon her . " it 's nothing to be so solemn about ! Why , half of the women are working at something nowadays . " Even in the anxieties and humiliations of those long days of haunting employment agencies , and interviewing prospective employers , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exulted in the contact with a world of vigorous life . She brought home the color of her days into the grayness of their evenings . Their meal hours , that had often been silent and burdened with monotony , were times now of a brisk reliving of events . Cora was happier , and that made him happier too . He could n't understand her difficulties in finding a place . To think of anyone not wanting Cora ! She explained the handicap of her lack of office training ; but it did n't seem to him that this should weigh at all against her intelligence and general desirability . When the place was found he did n't think it worthy of her . But she was delighted . She was to he in the office at one of the women 's clubs . Her work would be mainly answering telephones and keeping minor records . " But do n't you see , " she said , " I 'll be coming in contact with all sorts of interesting people . it 's just exactly what I want ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of living with a warm expansion of her personality . She was once more the Cora he had known so many years ago . Their life together was gay again . Only , through the long hours of the day , the house was still and empty , and there was nothing to keep him from thinking that if his life had been more successful he could havegiven Cora the things she needed to make her gay and happy and yet have her here with him , too . She always asked at night how his day had been filled . But what he had to tell of taking an impression for Mrs. Lorenson 's crown , pulling a wobbly front tooth for the Evans boy , sitting for hours trying to read the professional journals  --  all this seemed meaningless against her bright chatter of the important women whose comings and goings had filled her day . He hurried quickly over his account , in a low voice , almost as if these were things to be ashamed of ; and he soon got into the habit of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened here , of course . " It was n't long then before she stopped asking . Something new was coming into her manner toward him , too : a certain crispness of speech that often hurt him ; a way of hearing what he said as if it had little importance ; an air almost of condescension toward him . And through the days he had so much time to think about all this . It came , he thought , the new manner , largely from her daylong contact with women who were brisk and busy and important , women whose lives were set apart from failure . It must be hard for her to come home from that to this . He would sit for hours thinking about it . He rarely went out into the garden now . And it was hard to read when ones mind was so full of distressing things . He sat beside the little table , with his head resting on his hand , and thought . Cora had been working for about six months , and for at least two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But it was very hard to speak . Often when they sat for a few minutes at table after dinner , he would think , " Now I am going to say it . " Then his heart would beat quickly and he would grow a trifle dizzy ; Cora would begin some merry account of a happening of the day , and he would sink back in his chair with a limp sense of relief . Perhaps it would be easier at night , when he did n't have to look into her face . One night when he heard her stirring slightly beside him , he said , " You are n't asleep , are you , Cora ? " " No . " " I just wanted to say . . . " " Yes ? " " I 've been thinking . . . I have n't been able to do very much for you .. . I have n't made much of a success of things . . . and if you think . . . " Again he halted , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what you 're talking about . " " It was just that . . if you wanted to get a divorce .. " Well , what in the world . . I " Now that he had spoken thus far the rest was easier . He sat up beside her . " I can see now , by the way you 've been getting along with your work and all , that I 've kept you back a lot , Cora . You had it in you to make something of life . . . and I 'Ve sort of . . . I do n't know just what 's been the matter with me . .. but I could n't seem to get anywhere . . . . And now if you think you . .. could do better without me . . " The ring of impatience was sharper in her voice now . " Please do n't talk so foolishly ! " But the flood of waiting words would not be checked . " I guess divorces are pretty easy to get , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how people go about it . But I wanted you to know I 'd . . help , any way I could . I 've thought a lot about it , Cora , and I 'd understand . I 'd know it was best for you . You 're getting into a better kind of life now , and I do n't want to hold you back . " Part of his dread of speaking these words had been the fear that she would be moved to something like compassion , that she might even feel he had made a sentimental appeal to her pity . He was n't at all prepared for her anger . Her voice was harsh when she turned around to him . " That 's just what 's the matter with you , Howard ! Do n't you suppose that that might have a lot to do with your ' not getting anywhere , ' as you say ? You 've always been so sort of apologetic , so afraid of yourself , as if you were n't as good as other people . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness sake , do n't talk that way to me ! " After a little while she said , more quietly , " And what in the world do you suppose I want a divorce for ? " " I just thought you 'd be a lot freer ? . . for anything you wanted , " he explained fumblingly . " You do n't think I 'd want to marry again , do you ? " He did n't hear her laugh , but he knew that she must be smiling . And had n't there been just that faint note of scorn on the " again " ? He did n't say any more . Very soon she turned away from him " Let 's get to sleep now . Good night . " " Good night , dear . " When her breathing was slow and quiet and he knew she was sleeping , he laid his hand gently on her shoulder . It would n't disturb her now . He did n't want to do anything to disturb her . He loved her so much His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having these hours and hours to think , and no goal for all the thinking . But it would n't do , he told himself the next morning , to go on this way . This was the way a man could go to pieces , quickly  --  letting go of things , thinking too much , feeling that nothing was worth while . It comforted him to know that at least he was n't too far gone to see the danger of the situation . He would try to get hold of himself now . Perhaps Cora was right , about his having always too slight an opinion of himself . He would hold up his head and keep busy . But keeping busy was another problem . He went to the door eagerly every time the bell rang , but usually it was only an agent or a peddler . A dentist could n't go out onto the street and round up the passers-by and herd them in to have their teeth repaired ! How he envied the people who went hurrying by the house each morning , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night  --  without having had too much time for thinking . He began searching the flat for tasks he might undertake . If he could do a little of the brushing up from time to time , Cora would n't have so much to do on Saturday afternoon and Sunday . Then maybe they could go out together somewhere once in a while . He never told her what he had done until she was about to do it . Then he would say shyly , " I happened to have a little time and I attended to that . " And even if there was a note of laughing scorn in her voice when she said , " But what did you do that for ? " still he was happy about it . He began , too , trying to have things nearly ready for dinner when she got home . At first he just had the table set and the water boiling for tea . Even this was a help when Cora came in late and tired . Then he tried preparing things for their evening meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make a bit of salad as well as a woman ? The fact that the task was unfamiliar and took much more time than it should was only another point in favor of doing it . He remembered how he had once enjoyed cooking , on the camping trips they used to take . Over a gas range it ought to be easier than over a smoking open fire . He experimented with things for his solitary lunches , and if they turned out fairly well he had them ready for Cora 's dinner . " My , you 're getting to be quite an efficient housewife ! " she told him . He felt the sting of it , but it did n't go so deep as his satisfaction at doing something , and doing it for Cora . She did n't always come home to dinner . Sometimes when everything was ready the ' phone would ring and she would say that she was having dinner downtown with some of the people fromthe office . Then , first of all , he would clear away the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the corner of the kitchen table . If there was something quite special he had prepared , something he was rather proud of , he would put it aside for the next day , hoping that it would n't lose in the keeping . More and more these new tasks of his became an important part of his life . At first he had gone out rather shamefacedly on shopping expeditions . In the tones of the tradesmen 's deference , he thought he heard them saying , " Well , Doctor Burney , this is a strange thing for you to be doing ! " But now , after a good many months of it , he rather liked it all . He did n't feel any longer that it was something to be ashamed of . He even talked jestingly with one or two of his patients about his " household cares . " " Now that Mrs. Burney is a woman of affairs , you know , " he would explain playfully . It was Mrs. Lorenson who understood most fully . She laughed gaily at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that she understood . Mrs. Lorenson had been a patient for many years . She was a short , plump , rosy little woman . She looked so sturdy and yet she was always complaining that she could n't stand pain . Her dental work always dragged out month after month . " Just do a very little to-day , Doctor , " she would beg . " I feel as limp as a rag after a few minutes in this chair . " And when the day 's bit of work was finished , leaving almost everything to be done another time , she would sit for a long while in the little chair by the mirror . " You do n't mind , do you , Doctor ? " she would say . " I dread going right out onto the street . I feel sure that people can tell by looking at me what I have suffered . " While she sat there , and he occupied himself with putting his instruments away , they talked of many things . And when she went , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you , Doctor . You 're the very best friend I have . " Mrs. Lorenson liked to hear him tell of his household tasks and triumphs . " Mrs. Burney does n't know how lucky she is ! " she told him . " Do you suppose I could ever get my husband to do anything like that Why , he 'd sit there in a house full of food and starve to death without lifting a finger if I was n't there to fix it for him ! " Perhaps , she admitted , it was because Mr. Lorenson was n't at home enough to learn any useful accomplishments . He was a salesman for a coffee and spice establishment and " on the road " most of the time . " He just drops in about once a month , " Mrs. Lorenson used to say with a slow wink , " just to see if I 'm still there . " There was something a little " crude " about Mrs. Lorenson , Doctor Burney sometimes said to his wife ; but still he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she made one feel that she was truly interested in all that one said . And now , in these long lonely days , it was a real relief to have Mrs. Lorenson coming . Her work should n't have taken very long , but as usual she wanted it broken into small fragments and spread through many days , to save her nerves . " I hope you wo n't feel that that 's taking too much of your time , Doctor , " she said , with her serious round-eyed gaze upon him . He thumbed over the almost blank pages of his engagement book . " Why . . . no . . . 1 believe I can manage it , all right . " " Oh , I 'm so awfully glad ! You know , Doctor , I 'd hate to have to go to anyone else . My sister-in-law goes to a dentist downtown , and I keep telling her they 're all for show , down there , and I would n't trust their work a minute , compared to yours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did do careful , conscientious work . Better work than most of them . But he did n't often hear it praised . Praise , for anything , wasnot very familiar to him . It warmed him now . He did like Mrs. Lorenson . She wanted to help any way she could with his household problems . " You just tell me whenever you 're lip against it , " she said heartily , " and I 'll see if I ca n't help you out . Jim 's away again , and I 've got plenty of time on my hands . " He laughed when he told Cora about this offer . " Whenever you get an especially good salad , " he said , " you can know that Mrs. Lorenson made it . " Cora did n't laugh at all . " I hope you 'll have better sense than let her come out ! we ! " she said sharply . His smile faded . " I think you might trust me that far , " he answered quietly . Cora was away from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun down at the Club . Well-known people stood on the platform and told the ladies what to think about various matters . Cora found these lectures " very stimulating . " She was sorry that Howard could n't attend them too . There were some men in the audience . But of course he had his evening office hours , she knew , and it would n't do to neglect them . Once in a while , too , she wanted to go to the theater . Down there among those women , one had to keep up with things . She could always find a companion among her fellow-workers , but several times she asked Howard , " Do n't you want to go ? It is n't likely that anyone will be coming in to-night . And it would do you good . " But he did n't want to go . He felt shabby beside her , nowadays . Much of her earnings went into the maintenance of her wardrobe , and it had been very long since he had been able to achieve a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; he stood at the window in the morning to see her go down the street to the car . But he would feel uncomfortable beside her downtown . They might encounter some of these important new acquaintances of hers , and then Cora might not be able to keep him from seeing that she was n't wholly proud of him , and that would be very hard to bear . But it was seldom that anyone came at night for dental work , and the evenings when Cora was downtown were very cheerless . Sometimes he sat in the office without even lighting the light . The street lamps sent in a little radiance that touched bright spots of metal in the room . People passing on the sidewalk talked and laughed happily . There was a constant hum of motors , taking people somewhere . . . . He sat until it was almost time for Cora 's coming . Then he would light the light and take up hisbook . When he told Mrs. Lorenson about Cora 's evening lectures , she seemed to know at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on her hat , bending close across the table to the mirror , she said , " I do n't see why I ca n't have my work done evenings . With Jim gone , I 've got so much time on my hands I do n't know what to do with myself . Afternoons , 1 can go to the movies ; but I do n't like to go there alone by myself at night . " He did n't answer at once . He felt i strangely excited . " What evening can I come , Doctor ? " Mechanically , he picked up his limp gray engagement book . Even though the spaces under the dates were so nearly blank , still there was the same formula to be gone through . " Let me see . . . . Wednesday ? No ; Friday . How would Friday do ? " Mrs. Lorenson gave a little laugh . " Is Friday one of the lecture times ? " " Why , yes , I believe so , " he muttered . " You see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to take you from her . You have so little time to-gether . " " I . . . I think . . . Friday will be all right . " She was ready for the street now and she came across the room to him . Her eyes were very bright and merry . " It sounds just like a conspiracy , do n't it ? But why not ? I guess we 're entitled to some fun as well as the rest of ' em . If they want to leave us alone all the time , I guess that 's up to them . " He was n't aware of walking with her to the door . He found it hard to look into her face . His heart was beating disquietingly . At the opened door she pressed his hand warmly . " Friday evening then , Doctor . " When she was gone he paced back and forth through the dim hall until it was almost time for Cora to come . He did n't tell Cora about the change in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way her work dragged out . " You must be fond of each other 's company , " she had said once or twice , with her short laugh . And he would n't want Cora to say that now . It would make him feel uncomfortable . He could imagine himself even saying something extravagant in Mrs. Lorenson 's defense . For though she fell short in many ways of the higher standards , at least there was warmth in her ; and warmth , he knew , was a precious thing . On Friday evening when Mrs. Loren-son came a great constraint was on them both at first . He hovered over her uncertainly when she was in the chair . " Let 's see . . . what were we doing last time ? " " It 's terrihly sensitive , Doctor . Will you be just as easy as you can ? " It was n't long before she announced that she could n't stand any more this time . " There now , it feels better already , " she said when she got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor . " They stood facing each other a moment . Then he turned quickly to his instrument case and she went over to the mirror . " I guess I should n't wait too long to have that tooth finished , " she said after . a moment . " Had I better come tomorrow night , Doctor ? " " Why . . . I hardly think .. . " " Or will Mrs. Burney be home ? " There was no laugh in her voice tonight , but a quaver of earnestness . He was fumbling with his book again . " Let 's see Saturday ? Mrs. Burney often goes to the theater on Saturday . I could ' phone you . . . . But perhaps we 'd better say Monday . " She put down the comb that she had been running through her hair and got up to come over to him . " I want to come to-morrow , " she said . " I 'm very lonely . " He tried to look away from her , but she came close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down into her eager upturned face . " You 're lonely too , " she went on swiftly . " Do n't you suppose I know ? Do n't you suppose I can see it ? People who are n't lonely do n't have eyes like that . And why should n't you be lonely ? Why should you be ashamed to say so ? I tell you I 'm lonely . But you do n't have to tell me ! " He could n't look away now from her eyes . Something in him was drawn deeper and deeper into them . He was quivering slightly . " Do they think we can stand it forever ? " she burst out rather wildly . " Jim comes strolling in whenever it suits him and thinks I ought to be all ready and waiting to make a great big fuss over him . What does he care about me ? He has his other women here and there on the road . I 'm just one of them . The one he 's had the longest . The one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . I 'm lonely , I tell you . I want something else . " Her eyes were wet now , and she was pressed close against him . His arm went awkwardly about her shoulders . He did n't know what to say to her . Cora never cried . Cora was always very sure of herself . He found himself wishing that Cora would cry and he could hold her close to him like this . Then he might think of the words to say . " Let me come to-morrow night , " she was whispering . " ' Phone me if I can come . I want to so much . " He kept his arm about her shoulders as he walked with her to the door . She had n't worn a hat to-night . She lived just around the corner . " We 've got to he good to each other , " she was murmuring . " If they leave us alone like this we 've got to be good to each other . " The doorway was dim , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , warmly and moistly . In the morning he wondered nervously if Cora would say anything about her plans for the night . He could n't ask her . He knew there would be a betraying shake in his voice . Just as she was going out she called back , " I 'm staying down this afternoon to do some shopping . " " How about dinner ? " he managed to say . " Oh , I 'll be home by then ! " Halfway down the steps she turned back once more . " But I 'm not sure about to-night . " " I see . " He smiled down at her and wondered if it looked as strange as it felt . When she came home to dinner , she told him that she was going to the theater with one of the girls from the office . They had been informed that this play was very fine . " I knew there was no use asking you to go , " she said . " You always think you have to be here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " someone is coming . " She did n't ask who it was . She seldom asked about his work any more . " I 'm afraid I wo n't have time to help with the dishes , " she said when they were through with their meal . " No ; you 'd better run along . There are n't many anyway . " He tied one of her aprons about him and carried the dishes to the sink , while she hurried into the bedroom to dress . He had n't finished the dish-washing when she came out . He turned about to her . Cora looked very lovely these days . Especially in some of these new bright things of hers . She stood before him . " Am I all right ? " " You 're very beautiful , Cora . " There was something in his voice or his glance that seemed to move her to compunction . " I feel sort of mean , running away and leaving you to this ! " " Oh , I do n't mind doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . " She came over toward him . " I ca n't touch you , " he said . " My hands are all wet . " She took his face between her hands , just as she used to . The zest of the evening 's outing had put a sparkle in her eyes and a warmth in her voice . " You 're a dear good husband , Howard ! " He had to turn quickly away from her as soon as she let her hands fall . " You must n't think I just take it for granted , " she went on , " all the things you do for me . I know I do n't say much about it ; my mind is so full of things ; but I do appreciate it just the same , Howard . I think about it , lots . You 're a dear , and I love you . " He felt her quick kiss fall on his hair behind his ear . " Now I must be running ! Do n't come out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the front door close . He finished washing the dishes , dried them carefully , and stacked them away in the cupboard . Then he went to the telephone , in the dark bend of the hall . When he had given the number he listened tensely to the faint buzzing that came back to him from the other end of the line . " Mrs. Lorenson ? This is Doctor Burney speaking . " His voice grew surer and brisker as he went on . " I 'm afraid we 'll have to postpone that appointment till Monday afternoon . . . Yes , afternoon . . . . No ; I 'm going down to the theater with Mrs. Burney this evening . . . . Well , any afternoon next week . Good-by . " He stood there a moment longer at the ' phone . Then he turned slowly and went into the office . He did n't light the tight . With Cora 's radiance still in his eyes , all this would look very shabby and outworn to him now . He sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps  --  next year  --  it might be possible . the move downtown . 7
