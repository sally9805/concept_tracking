txt Letters from Readers of the Times on Topics in the News A Republican Points Out That We Have Fenced Ourselves In Too Securely To the Editor of The Yew York Times : To those who are looking for straws , the recent words of Roger W. Babson , to the effect that business has " turned the corner , " must come In the nature of a life-saver . If Babson has said it , there must be something behind it ; figures , at least . If it is true . and if the Jonglooked-for moment has arrived when business is ? to " pick up " again , it may be the psychological moment for a cash customer to speak . Paying " cash down " for an article ought to be the most desired form of trade . I have noticed it has been greatly appreciated during the recent financial depression . But there have been times when the payment of cash for a commodity has ? been a request often waived and even deprecated . The customer who makes a retail purchase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send " is often made to wait unnecessarily long for his change . Such a customer will often see another purchaser especially warmly welcomed and waited upon who does not pay cash , but who is a " regular customer " with his name " on the books . " Salesmen who are out for orders often fail to mention the cash value of the merchandise in question . " You do n't have to pay me anything now , " Is the oft-repeated remark , or " just pay me so much a month . " Carrying charge accounts and selling on the instalment plan are expensive methods of trade . Any one who stops to think about it realizes that the " overhead " for such concerns is necessarily high . But business men do not lose by such methods . Everything is paid for , as it is covered by the " price " of the commodity . This Is where the cash customer feels discriminated against . If he makes a purchase in a shop where a large clerical staff is employed to look after its charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows he is paying for luxuries which go to benefit others than himself . He is paying more for the article than it is itself worth . Of course , he can confine his shopping to " cash and carry " stores , where prices are conspicuously lower , but frequently the desired merchandise is not to be found in them . In a similar way paying cash down for an article usually sold on the instalment plan does not seem to offer the purchaser a square deal . The salesmen seem hesitant about admitting the true value of their goods as compared with the price required for it when it Is paid for on the instalment plan . They may say 5 per cent or perhaps 10 per cent off for cash . but one does not feel that they are making any special appeal for a cash purchase , or that they are trying to sell their merchandise at its real value . The cash customer may be a person who prefers to buy on credit . He may long for the enjoyment of selecting what he likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited income for which he has inordinate demands and he can not allow himself to take the risk of buying what he can not pay for . The cash customer may , on the other hand , be a person who is saddled by debts which he can not pay . Trades people refuse him further credit . They can not " carry " him any longer . What he buys he must pay for . The cash customer may also be a person of means who prefers to be under no obligation to any one . He completes each transaction at once and allows no ties to bind him in the future . The cash customer plays safe , he takes no chances . He knows what is his and what is not his . He stands on solid ground and faces the world unflinchingly . But he is an independent buyer and is apt to purchase his goods where he can get the most for his money . He is interested in the real value of articles . Is he a worthwhile member of society ? Should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash down " for what they want ? The cash customer makes this appeal : as business picks up again , may not a cash basis be adopted by all kinds of concerns ? May not commodities be given a more real value , representing what they are themselves worth , rather than what they can bring as a price ? If , for example , a customer wishes for credit . let him have his purchase charged to him and let him pay for that privilege , let us say one-half of one per cent of the account each month . One can not legitimately say that thirty days is " cash . " To run an account for thirty days means a considerable amount of clerical work . of stationery and of postage , and the customer should be ready to pay for it . The same could be said with regard to the delivery of goods . If the customer wishes an article delivered . he should be ready to pay extra for that convenience . The amount of the charge would depend on the size or number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be covered . If customers realized the expense involved in maintaining delivery trucks . they might prefer to take articles home in their waiting automobiles rather than to pay for the additional expense of having the store car wait upon them . Of course differences in the rents paid by concerns in different localities affect the value of the merchandise they sell . The amount of advertising necessary to successfully put new goods on the market is bound to raise the production price of articles . Freight rates , salesmen 's commissions , middle-men 's charges , the quality and quantity of the production of the merchandise , and other factors are expenses necessarily bound up in the determination of the " price " of any commodity . But the plea of the cash customer is that firms advertise themselves in the future as selling on a cash basis . Let it be apparent that they are making every effort to sell their goods for an immediate cash payment . Let them list their prices- as nearly the true value of their commodities as possible and let them list an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged or who wish to buy on the instalment plan . With such methods the unloading of goods upon the public would be slower . " Sales " would not be as frequent as at present , for prices could not sci readily " come down . " Goods claimed to be selling " below cost " would not be advertised so often . Still , clearance sales might be beneficial to tradesmen . or prices might be slightly lowered at intervals ; however . the cash ' customer would not feel that he had to postpone his purchasing in order to get goods at anywhere near their real value . If the recent depression has shown us anything , it has disclosed the unreal values untold business men had at- tached to their commodities . We have witnessed the decline M price of articles approximating the values asked by cash stores and large mail-order houses . The cash customer hopes that business men will not soon again inflate values and boost the credit system which has netted them so much profit in the past . R. C. METCALir Burlington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LATIN AMERICA Sister Republics Should Share Responsibilities of Giving Protection To the Editor of The New York Times : The clamor for the restatement of the Monroe Doctrine on the part of the representatives of Latin-American nations arises , no doubt , from the fact that the true purpose of the Monroe Doctrine is misunderstood by them . They perhaps confuse the activities on the part of the United States to preserve the Monroe Doctrine with the Monroe Doctrine itself . Analogous to it would be the confusing of the Eighteenth Amendment with the Volstead law . As I understand it , the Monroe Doctrine is a doctrine expressed by the United States to the effect that no European power shall acquire territory in the Western Hemisphere for the purpose of colonization . An exception was made , of course , to the territory held by European powers at the time the Monroe . Doctrine was promulgated . All LatinAmerican countries must be in accord with the doctrine itself , I feel sure . They perhaps do not agree with the means we have taken to preserve it . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It behooves these men to consider the whole question carefully by the light of logic rather than by the flame of patriotic emotion . These men must surely realize that because of unstable conditions in certain Caribbean , Central American and certain countries in the northern part of South America , certain European governments have had not only the opportunity but also the right to take measures for the redress of wrongs . In order that the adjustments required might not become a pretext for occupation of the soil of such countries involved , and perhaps the extinguishment of their sovereignty , it became necessary for the United States to intervene in the affairs of those countries . Later on , because of these experiences , when the conditions in certain republics became such that European nationals must certainly become involved if disorder was not checked , the United States attempted to check such disorder and minimize the danger to European nationals , as well as to American citizens in those republics . All of this has been misinterpreted to mean imperialism on the part of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit Latin-American republics to assist harasseu sister republics . They have it within their power at this very moment to offer advice , - counsel or even armed forces to any LatinAmerican nation that temporarily finds itself unequal to its task . In fact it has always been within the power of Latin-American republics to prevent the weaker Latin-American governments from doing those things which have so involved these unstable nations that the United States has been , at times , compelled to intervene . In several instances it looks very much as if , had the United States not intervened , the sovereignty of the offending republics might have been forfeited to the nations which they had offended . But this must at all times be understood ; there must be protection of both life and of property in an impartial manner in all such republics . Our government will be glad at all times , I am sure , to have the assistance of the sister republics on this hemisphere in maintaining such protection . To me it does not appear important whether this protection is given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republics , so long as this protection is given . The United States has acquired the status of a commercial nation . The citizen in his everyday walks of life is affected by the acts and fortunes of other Americans engaged in commercial pursuits . Therefore , the citizen has the duty , and the right , to be vitally concerned in the preservation of American life and American property in other lands . Not only must the citizen of the United States insist that American citizens trade and deal with nationals of other countries , and with heads of other governments , in a manner most equitable and just , but that such nationals and such governments respect American life and American property . There is a warm sympathy on the part of the citizens of the United States for our sister republics on this hemisphere .

MOUNT RORAIMA To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with interest in THE TIMES several articles dealing with the proposed expedition of the Museum of Natural History into Venezuela under the heading " Lost World Quest . " Mount Roraima is to be visited and it is stated that the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his famous novel " The Lost World " on stories he had heard of this mountain . It might interest readers to know that Sir Arthur was not familiar with the peculiar topography of Mount Roraima . When discussing the subject with him in 1923 he told me that his novel was the outcome of a conversation he had with Colonel P. H. Fawcett , who was lost a few years later in the Brazilian hinterland . Throughout Central Brazil isolated plateaus rising vertically out of the surrounding country are frequently encountered , and it wee Colonel Fawcett 's vivid description of these that inspired Sir Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is roughly 1,500 miles away to the northward .

NAMING OUR NATIONAL TREE Plea for the White Pine , Which Served So Well The Need of the Colonists To the Editor of The New York Times : Referring to Secretary Wilbur 's recent news release quoting a British Army officer 's suggestion that the giant sequoia of the Sierras should be declared our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking In devotion to " the greatest and noblest of living things " by suggesting that if there is to be a national tree it ought to be the white pine of our Eastern and Middle States and Southeastern mountains . Vigorous and beautiful though the white pine is , it can not compete , of course , in these respects with King Sequoia . It is what it was to the nation in infancy and youth that entitles it to the highest honors that a nation can pay to a tree . Of the 1.065,000 square miles of incomparable forest that , east of the prairies , faced the young nation clinging to Eastern seacoasts , 49 per cent ( or 440,000 square miles ) was coniferous , and of these a large proportion was white pine . The soft but powerful quality of its wood , easy to saw , split and tool , yet unequaled for every home-making purpose , from weather-boarding and flooring to platters and spoons , made national growth at American speed and comfort possible , while its easy lumbering , hewing and sawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave impetus to trade , providing for many years the market vigor which has characterized our progress from Colonial times . The high tide of the white pine era is not so far back that hundreds of thousands now living do not recall it in full detail . Millions now living sunk their jack-knives daily in its close white flesh for the innumerable things that boys once made for themselves or did without . Any other wood was scarce around the " place , " which was even picketfenced , except for the posts , in pine . Even into powerful speeding maittaity , this nation was builtenp , of white pine and prospered because of it . Of course we ran through it to the finish , as Americans always do . ? Its price rose with scarcity . Eventually it passed out of the general market , other soft woods from the South and West supplying parts of its uses ; no other wood can ever fill all its uses . But it did not , like the passenger pigeon and other early Americans who suffered from popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hid safely in the forest fastnesses of New England , the Adirondacks , Pennsylvania and the uplands of the Southern Appalachians carry on into the future nature 's unbroken story . And scattered over hundreds of thousands of farm lands , wooded slopes and summits , the young of the species are pushing skyward with characteristic energy . Speeders on the highways of New England point them out in open fields and on the edges of woods everywhere . The white pine can no more be destroyed than the nation that it built up . Highest priced of all our lumber , it may never again figure in the market , but there are uses for which it will always be essential . One of these , not a commercial but a far higher use , is to be beautiful . It is seldom a stately tree , and rarely composed and regular of aspect , but as independent of body and full of action as the nation it symbolizes so well . Often it flings it arms aloft as if beckoning on its fellows to a greater future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and achievement . Wo dare say that the day of the white pine Is past ? Or even that it has come ? Like the giant sequoia , the white pine is a national park tree . Both attain their greatest stands in national parks , the giant sequoia in Sequoia National Park and the white pine in the Great Smoky . It is honor enough , even for the giant sequoia. to be King of Trees . Let us pay some very small part of our vast debt to the white pine by pronouncing it the national tree of America .

HELPING THE JEWS IN EUROPE To Me Editor of The New York Times : Why should the American Jew , himself a victim of world-wide economic depression , help the Jew in Eastern and Central ' Europe ? Why , when there is hardship and suffering in his own city , should the Jew in New York contribute to a fund that is to be spent in other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the existence of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the reason for its current endeavor to raise $1,000 , - 000 in the city of New York . Here are the answers : 1 . The Jew in Eastern and Central Europe is a far greater sufferer than the Jew in New York . He is the victim of a prolonged economic depression that has grown steadily worse since the war , and has been a continuous process of deterioration , a progressive aggravation of poverty . 2 . He is the victim not alone of adverse economic forces , but of discrimination and of ancient hates and prejudices . 3 . In Eastern and Central Europe the Jew has little or no opportunity to improve his condition in the absence of help from abroad . Occupations in which he formerly engaged are now closed to him . There is a new order of things , constructed without consideration for the Jew , and even if the economic situation should improve , the Jew would be the last to benefit . 4 . All hope of retreat from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . By helping the Jew abroad the Jew in New York ultimately will help himself , for it is axiomatic that no country can prosper when its entire Jewish population is on the verge of annihilation ; and until countries abroad begin to prosper America can not prosper . The joint distribution committee has a program not alone for emergency relief but for permanent economic rehabilitation . 6 . Each of us is his brother 's keeper , and when it is brought home to us that among the Jews in Europe the abandonment of children by their mothers is an every-day occurrence , that suicides are so common they no longer attract attention and that starvation stalks through the streets , we respond to the call of human misery regardless of whence it may come . American Jewry , so favorably situated compared to their brethren on the other side , can not sit idly by while four million Eastern and Central European Jews are relentlessly being ground to death between the upper millstone of general economic depression and the nether millstone of anti-Jewish restrictive measures . Notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Jewry have now launched a new drive to raise two and a half million dollars as the minimum budget for the social and economic reconstructive work in Poland and Rumania , Lithuania and Latvia . New York City 's quota is one million dollars . At this time , therefore , it is not Inappropriate to find out what the joint distribution committee has thus faeaccomplished in Eastern and Central Europe , as well as the outlook for the future . To begin with , during the war period and the years immediately following the war , tens of thousands of Jewish dwellings were destroyed . The joint distribution committee has built 12,000 new houses . The committee has felt all along that the Jewish tradesmen and middlemen must perforce be re-educated and converted into productive artisans . For this purpose a great number of trade schools are maintained in the large cities . Seven hundred and sixty credit cooperatives are now functioning in the Eastern and Central European Jewish communities . Six years ago there were only 400 of these credit organizations . The total resources of these cooperatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,300,000 represents the capital shares and reserves and $11 , - 750,000 represents the savings and time deposits . The joint distribution committee and the Jewish Colonization Association . ( known throughout Europe as " ICA ' ) have invested three million dollars . Hundreds of thousands of small loans have been made ; tens of thousands of Jewish families were made more or less selfsupporting . The work of the joint distribution committee , for some years past , has been largely of a reconstructive rather than merely relief nature . Upward of 80 per cent of the money collected in the United States goes for constructive activities . It would be erroneous to assume that the American Jews bear the entire ? or even greater  --  part of the burden of maintaining the communal institutions of East European Jews . As a matter of fact , despite their terrible hardships and handicaps. the East European Jews themselves supply between 75 and 80 per cent of the funds required for running the communal organizations . However , the remaining 25 or 20 per cent are of tremendous importance . American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute the " missing dollar " without which Jewish communal work abroad must come to a halt .

OLD AGE PENSIONS To the Editor of The New York Times : Tian TIMES does well to publish a full report such as that of William Green on old-age pensions , and his suggested panacea for unemployment and old-age legislation is worthy of thoughtful consideration . The problems are old and it is probably the world-wide business depression that , by accentuating the miseries of unemployment and the parlous condition of old-age dependency , has focused public attention and discussion with a view to removing these blots on the escutcheon of our civilization . It has become an accepted truth that the average limit of life and its activities is threescore years and ten . Statistics seem to bear this out despite notable instances of those who , reaching far beyond that life-limit , have done much in their later years . The human system can bear extremes of heat and cold and endure hardships and achieve tasks that are truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are diminished perceptibly and , in some , those of the mind . The dread of the poorhouse , the apprehension of dependency are factors that enter largely into the vicissitudes of " our discordant life , " and it behooves the best minds of the nations to devise ways and means whereby unemployment and old-age pension shall usher in the better day , dreamed of by seer and poet and philanthropist . D. HAVELOCH FISHER . RETURN OF OUR PROSPERITIY HAMPERED BY TARIFF WALLS A Republican Points Out That We Have Fenced Ourselves In Too Securely To the Editor of The New York Times : It is a shocking spectacle to witness the greatest , richest and most enlightened nation the world has ever seen brought to her knees within two years from the peak of prosperity by an unprecedented economic crisis . What is the matter , and how can this intolerable situa- tion be cured ? We are floundering around in a slough of despond with no sign of a captain to rescue us , although innumerable prophets , from President Hoover down , have voiced their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . These predictions sound well enough , but why not look the matter squarely in the face , and rote the facts ? The present is a time of world-wide readjustment to changed conditions resulting from too rapid development and expansion of every kind , in which the war was perhaps the first violent symptom . It was followed by a series of economic fevers , embracing artificially high prices for everything , esulted S which in the present collapse with an awakening of the greedy human animal to the fact that something drastic must be done to recover from this sickness . The parallel between our times and those after the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars is striking in its similarity , although this crisis has been more disastrous , as more and far richer nations are involved . But the world finally righted itself in those past days , after readjustments were made , and the same thing is bound to happen again . What should be done now , however , is to remold our ways so that such a situation is less likely to recur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , by our very nature , are in large measure responsible for what has happened , and by every standard are the ones to lead the way to better days . But unless we can temper our desires with the milk of human kindness , we are not fit to lead . Without going back to pre-war days , let us examine the events which caused the trouble and then study the possible remedies , as any doctor would , that offer a solution to the problem : Sitting on top of unparalleled natural resources when the war came on , and possessing manufacturing facilities which had made us rich beyond the dreams of avarice , we were called upon to supply the fighting nations with everything they needed at our own price . Then , upon our entry into the struggle , we lent our ? Allies untold sums of money . Little of this money ever left our shores ! We sent them goods instead , for which they gave us promises to pay , represented by their reparation debts today ; and since the war we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we built a tariff wall round about us , culminating in the ludicrous structure erected by the present administration , the most asinine thing any sane people ever tried to do . And finally , through a speculative orgy and high interest rates , we have drawn something like forty per cent of the gold in all the world within our borders . Without gold , and not allowed to ship in their goods because of our tariff wall , how can the debtor nations hope to pay their bills to us ? Better to cancel the debts entirely , if we must maintain the tariff ; although , better still , to do away with much of this obnoxious tariff , and let international trade revive , for that is the very breath of life to all the world . We can not blame the other nations for erecting tariff walls of their own . They have only copied us . Unrest in the Latin-American countries and the change of government in Spain are directly attributable to economic causes . If these countries . can not trade with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising to see them embrace some , or all , of the Soviet doctrines before long . China is on the brink of it at present . And what effect Is Russia , with her Five-Year Plan , going to have on the situation ? She is organized to carry on , and it is only a question of how long she can maintain her discipline . If this FiveYear Plan does not succeed , she iS sure to declare another one . Her steel production is already large and I am told it will shortly overtop that of England herself . And after that , what next will she accomplish ? Whether the Soviet lives or dies , the good parts of its economic structure will survive to be incorporated in Russia 's own , as well as in some foreign , future governments . The French revolution , while it did not itself last , had a profound effect upon the world , and the present Russian r ? gime is bound to react in a similar manner upon the world of tomorrow . It is even now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press . These causes , together with the artificially high cost of labor in this country , have all influenced the present situation . They will slowly correct themselves , as they always have done ; but is there not something we can do to help the patient ? Much has been published about the lack of gold necessary to handle the trade of the world . That is sheer nonsense . There is plenty of gold , if the United States and France would disgorge some of their tremendous holdings , and the other nations would install better credit systems . The quantity of gold for monetary purposes has increased at a larger percentage annually than the per cent of yearly increase in the production of basic commodities throughout the world since 1900 . The whole economic difficulty we are going through today seems to me to spring from the preposterous tariff walls reared round most countries , beginning with our own , which suppress , and almost prohibit , international trade . They have got to come down , and the high cost of labor in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand are going to prevail the same as they always have . No individual , corporation , industrial group or government can alter them . It has been tried by all of them with disastrous results to all , and the sooner we realize it the better for every one . And unless our tariff is lowered , the ? Republican party might just as well look for a defeat at the polls next election . I am a Republican myself , but I believe that the passage of the last tariff bill and its signature by President Hoover was the gravest mistake the party , and he , has ever made . ALEXANDER P. ROGETtS . New York , April 27 , 1931 . BUSINESS NEEDS NEW APPROACH Our Industrial Leaders Are Steeped in Producers ' State of Mind To Ms Editor of The New York Times : The continued stagnation of industry and the bankruptcy of constructive ideas on the part of industrial leaders suggestis a deeper and more fundamental defect in our industrial system than has yet been brought to open discussion . Industrial leaders are being warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid legislative interference . New political parties are being advocated . Elaborate plans are being proposed for a better distribution of income , for the stabilization of industry , for functional coordination of industrial processes , for national planning boards , economic councils , and the like . But none ' of these things consider the problem of the type of mind necessary to bring about these improvements ( or reforms ) in the industrial system . This is the crucial point which all of the proposed panaceas fail to discuss . The fundamental defect in our present industrial system is the mental attitude of the majority of our business leaders . It reaches down through the whole business system . All but a few of our industrial leaders lack the attitude of mind needed to make a constructive approach toward the solution of modern problems . The need for a new attitude on the part of the rank and file of business leaders has existed since 1920 , and it is more pressing today than ever before . The proofs of this are overwhelming . Our industrial leaders are steeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last eighty years . American business approached every problem from the producers ' point of view .

Everything else we did was either incidental or a by-product of the production complex . As long as the major problem of society was to produce goods , - the mind that thought and acted in terms of production was adequate . But with the coming of age of a number of industrial countries , and especially with the perfection of mass production in a period of less than ten years , the major problem has shifted from one of producing goods to one of producing buyers . Buyers mean problems in human relations . They require an understanding and the manipulation of elements that now appear to be so disconnected that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen .

And these things are still further related to other factors , some of which are tangible and others intangible . Tariffs , reparations and war debts , rapidly changing governments , international action for national prosperity , are some of the factors lengthening the chain of circumstances affecting the individual and the economic system in the smallest village as well as in the world capitals .

How may such an attitude be created ? First of all , It will have to be created within the business structure itself . No agency or system on the outside can do it . Then , business will have to call in a new type of worker who will create a new type of medium through which he will tackle the solution of problems in human relations .

As between being deprived of a post . office or the helpfulness of a bank no thoughtful business man would hesitate to sacrifice the postoffice . The free service rendered a community by banks can hardly be reckoned . They are almost an absolute necessity . But the Reserve banks have deprived these small banks of a source of revenue that has seriously crippled their earning power . I refer to Imposing upon them the clearing of checks free . The revenue derived from that source alone amounted to enough to satisfy a modest return upon their stock investment . And it was not a serious toll imposed upon business . The centralization of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quite impossible for the rank and file of the small member banks to get a hearing . The large and powerful banks have " their day in court , " but not the small-town bankers . The loans the smaller banks make are largely secured by collateral based upon the character of the borrower ; mortgages on live stock . crops , &c.; Behind such collateral is the character of the borrower . City banks have access to stocks and bonds as security for their loans , but not the rural and small-town banker . Again there remains this fact : the large banks wholesale money whereas the small banker retails it . The difference in the cost of " selling , " bookkeeping , &c.,; of a 4100,000 loan and a $100 loan is about equal . Necessarily the charge per dollar can not remain the same and the small banks find a profit in the transaction . The terms allowed by the Reserve Banks do not meet the needs of any section I travel . Not a crop can be seeded , cultivated and harvested within a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately . To fabricate and sell and collect on shoes or clothing or prints or anything within four months is an utter impossibility . The consequence  --  the industrialists are constantly building up cash re-. serves so that they will be independent of bankers and the facilities of the Reserve Banks  --  Henry Ford 's cash $300,000,000 , the United States Steel 's cash reserve , &c.; The terms allowed by the Reserve Board do not serve the commerce of the nation . They may meet the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange , but not the farmer , the cattleman or the manufacturer . Years ago it was an axiom of business that a concern could borrow . money cheaper than it could own it . Dividends of 6 per cent and 8 per cent were expected , and money could be borrowed around 3 per cent and 4 per cent per year . Hence the justification for the statement above . But no well-managed corporation today feels safe in taking such an attitude . If the Fords , General Motors , United States Steel , the great oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how argue the farmers , the cattlemen and the small businessmen can ? . But what are you going to do about it ? you ask . Well , suppose we admit that one of the highest attributes of a human being is his ability to think ? And we weigh the suggestion the late Senator J. W. Bailey of Texas advanced ten years ago ? Senator Bailey then said : " We should refund our Liberty bonds and instead of paying 4114 per cent allow same to draw 14 or 2 per cent , but allow the owners of such bonds to hypothecate them with the treasury and receive Currency up to their face value . " The saving to the treasury would enable the government to reduce the appropriations by a wide margin . A. stable and adequate circulation would be assured . Seriously and candidly. the present stalemate in business can not be brushed aside as one does a discarded handkerchief . The failure of the Reserve Banks to measure up to their opportunities can not be ignored . The small member banks can perhaps forgive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret poll of these small member banks could be taken it would surprise the Reserve chiefs to learn how low aria they esteemed . Senator Bailey made his suggestion more than ten years ago . Suppose it had been adopted ? But we have to learn by experience , and some can not even learn at that school . In this possibly the richest agricultural section of the nation money can not be borrowed . We are truly devoting our time and investments to the task of " subduing the earth " and increasing the wealth of the world , and we are deprived of the assistance of money , whereas in New York it 10 listed as being unemployed ! Can thinking men and women find justification for assuming the Reserve System has lived tip to its responsibilities ? DAN F. SMITH . San Antonio , Teitas , April 23 , 1931 . READING NEWSPAPERS To the Editor of The New York Times : A. J. Franck 's article on " A Reader 's Test " was timely . His catechism on himself as to whether he was not wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events and places is suggestive , but his " self-examination " would not be so " appalling " if he confined himself to reading only that which is of most personal interest and utility . No one can remember all he reads in a newspaper , and it is a good thing that he can not . The proper way is to read with discrimination and judgment and cull the most serviceable articles for future use and review from time to time . Recollection is re-collecting . Reviewing cements the valuable ideas and converts the raw material into a finished product . For instance , I am mostly interested in the literary and scientific portions of the paper . After I scan the foreign and political news and take a slant at baseball , I turn to the articles I most prefer and blue pencil the ones I need in my work . Later I clip them , place them in a scrap book and review . It is no use trying to remember everything one reads . Separate the wheat from the chaff and make grist out of only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory with a plethora of useless reading is detrimental to both mind and body . Remember only the useful , harmonious and efficient portions and let the rest go into oblivion . GEORGE E. DYE , Eatgburgb , ka ? April 27 , 1931 ,
