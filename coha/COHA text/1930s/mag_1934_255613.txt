Last week for the first time in the dark &; stormy history of East Texas oil fields a State body , controlling production , and a Federal body controlling interstate shipments , sat down in a joint effort to stop the flagrant traffic in illegal oil . It took a raging gasoline price war to bring this logical event about ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . <P> In a one-story building in Kilgore in the heart of the East Texas Field , where hot oil is now flowing at the rate of at least 100,000 bbl. per day , seven men hunched around a long council table-three members of the new Federal Tenders Board , three members of the State Tenders Board and Col. Ernest O. Thompson , dominant member of the Texas Railroad Commission which is supposed to regulate the oil business of Texas . By order of Oil Administrator Ickes not a drop of oil could be accepted for interstate shipment without a tender certifying its legality . <P> To the excited leaseholders , landowners , operators , pipeliners , refiners and their swarming lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is legal oil . We are going to keep all illegal oil out of interstate commerce by stopping it at the State line . " <P> For once it looked as if the Administration meant business . President Roosevelt , pelted with demands for action , declared that adequate enforcement of the Oil Code was necessary to prevent surpluses accumulating . Having received his orders from Attorney General Cummings . L. R. Martineau Jr. , the new special oil prosecutor , darted by plane to the East Texas Field to lead a platoon of Federal agents into the murky forest of 10,000 derricks . <P> To New Jersey where the gasoline war burned hottest Administrator Ickes dispatched a lieutenant to investigate and intervene . By last week joyous Jersey motorists were filling their tanks for less than 10 per gal. , tax included . New areas were affected , and in Philadelphia the battle spread to fuel oil , which dropped 1 per gal . to 5 . But in East Texas the Federal pressure brought quick results . This week some 50 East Texas refiners agreed to up wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's war price . <P> Meantime the industry tossed in secret strife over the price of crude oil which has been $1 per bbl. for a year . After a few small buyers boldly chopped the posted price to 60 , Col. Thompson swore that the Texas Railroad Commission would shut down every well in the State if the major companies followed suit . <P> From the moment the Federal Tenders Board went to work in Kilgore , it was apparent that the wily hot-oil runners were in for real trouble . The Federal Board took its cues from the State but the final decision on the status of any lot of oil actually rested on a bulldogged , stone-steady gentleman named Captain E. N. Stanley . He was the Railroad Commission 's chief enforcement officer . After an application was read , the Board would turn for advice to Captain Stanley , who passed about one in seven . Notorious hot-oil runners-and he knew them all-he cheerfully referred to as ' ' regular customers . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
