Most members of the Methodist Episcopal Church , the Methodist Episcopal Church South , and the Methodist Protestant Church , were pleased last week to learn that by next summer they will probably belong to a new church , a plain Methodist Church . With 8,000,000 communicants , 20,000,000 constituents and 29,000 ministers , the new church will be the nation 's largest Protestant body . Ratification of the merger of the three churches , proposed three summers ago ( TIME , Aug. 26 , 1935 ) , requires assent of three-quarters of the conferences of each Methodist branch . Northern Methodists and the Methodist Protestants had ratified , and by last week in 30 of 42 Southern Methodist conferences , 90% of those voting favored the merger . Formal ratification must wait , however , on action by the Southern Church 's annual conference next May . <P> But if the Methodist churches seem to be finding a new unity in the U. S. , in foreign lands they face new problems . In Chicago last week met the Board of Foreign Missions of the Northern Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lately been before other missionizing churches , was : What to do about the Sino-Japanese War ? U. S. Protestant churches spend nearly $4,000,000 a year for their Chinese missions , have many more millions invested in their 252 hospitals , their 21 colleges and universities . Of the missionaries who run such institutions , fully 95% have declined to leave China , because those in the interior have lived for years with the natives ; because many are doing hospital work in war areas . This is true also of Methodists who have 500 missionaries in China and spend some $500,000 a year on missions . <P> Mindful that pacifists have pointed warningly to the great stake of the U. S. churches in China , to the possibility that churches may be inclined to put pressure on the Government to look out for their interests , Executive Secretaries Dr. Ralph Eugene ( " Diff " ) Diffendorfer and Dr. William Edward Shaw of the Methodist Board of Foreign Missions told the Chicago meeting that Methodist missionaries " have agreed that no personal or property damage that may be incurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for war threat or indemnity demand . " <P> But diplomacy is quite as big a prob-lem as neutrality to churchmen . Secretaries Diffendorfer and Shaw were cautious indeed about condemning Japanese aggression in China . In the sight of God , Japanese souls are quite as good as Chinese souls , and the autonomous Japanese Methodist Episcopal Church has its own Japanese bishop and 20,000 faithful . Said the secretaries : " It must be remembered that the open sympathy of America for China and the statements and resolutions from this country arouse antagonism in the minds of many Japanese , and , as a matter of course , the position of American missionaries is made more delicate and difficult .
