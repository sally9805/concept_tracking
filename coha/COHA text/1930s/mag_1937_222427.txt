Ordinary mortals oppressed by the increasing number of big-game fishermen whose conversation about the niceties of taking sailfish , marlin , broadbill and tuna is lofty and arcane , should welcome a new book about catching huge fish by an author who neither prates of his own prowess nor rates all other quarry as paltry beside his own. * The quarry of Colonel Hugh D. Wise , U. S. Army retired , is sharks . He apologizes for this , admits that sharks are not generally eaten , do not leap when hooked and are not formally regarded as " game " fish . But they are " as strong as a mule and as hard to kill as a cat . " They are handier and less expensive for ordinary mortals to hunt than most big-game fish ; they are more plentiful , and destructive to nicer fish . <P> Colonel Wise got started shark-fishing as a boy off the Virginia Capes , when he threw a weakfish out for a big Hammerhead shark and was towed around for miles in his dory . He learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily and bloody ones . He learned how to cure a hooked shark of sulking on the bottom : send a lively crab down the line to pinch his nose . <P> After years of observation and checking up on shark stories . Colonel Wise testifies that there is no fixed answer to the old question whether sharks will attack men . They mostly will not if they are well fed , not excited , not convinced the man is helpless . They mostly will if given a blood scent or if startled by what they think is an attack on them . And different species , of course , have different appetites . Best rule , thinks Colonel Wise , is not to trust sharks . <P> Two expeditions to Andros Island by Colonel Wise , whose literary style is as unpretentious as his experting , were made perfect by E. M. Schuetz , resident manager in Nassau for National Fisheries Corp. , a commercial sharking company , to whom prospective sharkers might well apply . Gleeful was his reply to an angler returning home on the S. S. Munargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Wise could truthfully say : " We used them for bait . " His biggest catch at Andros was a Great Blue shark that measured 11 ft. 7 in. , weighed 954 lb . But far bigger ones , of course , got away , by getting into coral caves or snapping the heaviest lines . <P> Between seasons Colonel Wise once tested , and later compared with a shark 's , the pull that a man can exert swimming against rod &; reel . His figures for a 6 ft. 3 in . Princeton water poloist harnessed , and for young male Sand sharks of the same weight ( 200 lb. ) hooked in the mouth : <P> Man Shark <P> Surges 94 lb. 96 lb . <P> Steady 60 lb. 34 lb . <P> <P> * TIGERS OF THE SEA-Colonel Hugh D.
