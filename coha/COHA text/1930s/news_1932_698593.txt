txt PICTURE POSTCARDS To the ; Editor of The New York Ttmee : In commenting on picture postcards THE TIMES says . " They came into use some time in the ' 90s . About the time of the St. Louis World 's Fair they were still such a novelty as to be carefully preserved in albums . " May I add a bit of information regarding the man who introduced them in the United States ? " I recall the day , in 1893 , when the late Carl Voelker , editor of a German-language newspaper in Atlantic City , showed me an assortment of souvenir cards his wife had brought to this country after a visit at her childhood home on the Rhine . The fair at St. Louis did not open until April 20 , 1904 . Hence Mrs. Voelker 's trip abroad preceded that event by approximately ten years . Without doubt , the credit of introducing the colored postcards in this country belongs to Carl Voelker , who died in 1908 . He asked me what I thought of getting out an edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selling them in quantities to the various hotels and business men . It was entirely his idea . I advised him to go ahead and recommended the well-known Ketterlinus Lithographic Company of Philadelphia as publishers of the first edition of picture postcards in the United States . ALFRED M. HESTON . Ossining , N. Y. , March 2 , 1932 ,
