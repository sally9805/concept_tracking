txt President Roosevelt dominated American foreign policy during the past week with a succession of three more dramatic moves of import to the world . He started out the week on Sunday with the terse promise to his Warm Springs . Georgia , neighbers that he would see them in the fall ? " if we do n't have war . " On Tuesday at his press conference he indorsed an editorial in the Washington Post in terms which amounted to making its words his own . The editorial developed the now familiar refrain that war in Europe would vitally affect the United States and that therefore it is to America 's self-interest to attempt to avert war by strengthening the resistance of Britain and France to the Rome-Berlin Axis . On Friday he made a ringing speech on Pan American solidarity in which he again warned Europe that the American continents are not open for conquest . Also , he used the speech as a vehicle for expressing his opinion on the merits of what is going on in Europe . He scoffed at the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Germany is the victim of " encirclement . " This last direct attack on the foundation of Italo-German justification constitutes one of the most extreme extensions of the President 's influence into European affairs . In effect he announced to the world that he had examined the Italian and the German ' cases and found them without base . At the same time he made it clear that he considers the efforts of England and France to prevent any further changes in the map of Europe to be fitting and proper and worthy of American support . Nothing Much Really New Of course there is nothing new in this general attitude . It has been expressed over and over again since Munich by lesser officials of the Administration and in less graphic and positive form by the President himself . But in this triple repetition of the theme in such positive form the President was doing more than go through another rehearsal . Last week was in fact what he and his diplomatic advisers have been rehearsing for . Their information was that the real crisis which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood to have told the President over the telephone that war would come this week . On the basis of such alarming opinion from advisers in Europe and such ' actual information as continued arrival of Italian hoops in Spain , heavy German artillery movements into northern Italy and departure of the German Fleet for Spanish waters , it was decided in long night conferences at the White House to go through the routine in earnest this time , and act it as it had never been done before . That is what is happening . Washington is trying to Impress on Rome and Berlin that American support will be behind England and France if war comes . It is making the effort as it was never made before because it believes that this is the crucial moment between war and peace . Fame Leans on a Thin Reed Heavy stakes are involved . Among them should be numbered President Roosevelt 's future place in history . He has staked his own prestige and reputation on the outcome . If Germany and Italy should capitulate before the new show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the great protector of the status quo  --  the man who kept the familiar form of the world from being revised . Certainly he is more responsible than any other individual for mobilizing the effort . The steps taken here since Germany occupied Bohemia , Moravia and Memel to goad Britain to resistance will provide one of the most fascinating chapters in the background history of modern times when , and if , it is ever written . He has engineered a developing world movement to resist revision of the world 's boundaries , spheres of influence and forms of government , If his efforts succeed and peace is re-established along roughly the present outline of the world , Mr. Roosevelt will have much more than retreived on the foreign stage what he has lost on the domestic . But there are still many uncertainties . There is widespread reluctance on the part of many elements of public opinion to go along with the President 's policy . The resistance front in Europe may crumble . A war may upset every calculation . Today , it is merely a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
