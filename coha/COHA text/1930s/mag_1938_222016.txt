After putting his foot in his mouth while speaking to the press during the Washington Disarmament Conference , President Warren Gamaliel Harding , to save diplomatic embarrassment , ordered that correspondents must put their questions to him in writing . Calvin Coolidge perfected this technique by inventing " a White House spokesman " to whom his words must be attributed . Last week when Franklin Roosevelt wanted to read U. S. Business and Labor a lecture on " sabre-rattling " ( see p. 63 ) , comparing them to the bad boys of European politics in a way that might have provoked protests from " friendly nations , " the " spokesman " reappeared . He also touched on taxes . It was deliberate distortion , he said , for Administration critics to say that Federal taxes are heavier than they were two , three , five years ago . <P> Very next day , Mr. Roosevelt 's Secretary of the Treasury officially reported on U. S. tax receipts for fiscal 1938 . Final tabulation showed them to have been $5,659,000,000-an all-time high , topping even post-War 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 's $1,620,000,000 , 1937 's $4,653,000,000 . <P> &gt; U. S. military circles were surprised and not entirely pleased when the President , after talking with U. S. District Attorney Lamar Hardy of Manhattan , suddenly cracked out on the subject of spies . The U. S. , said the President , was woefully under-equipped for counterespionage-for tab-keeping on foreign agents in the U. S. ( not for spying abroad , in which the U. S. never did specialize ) . The Army &; Navy intelligence services must be strengthened , said the President . This announcement synchronized misleadingly with the State Department 's deadline for the registration of commercial , legal and publicity agents for foreign powers within U.S. borders . <P> &gt; This week the State Department made public a list of 106 registrants , mostly innocuous advertising and publicity agents hired for legitimate trade boosting . Examples : Batten , Barton , Durstine , &; Osborn ( Dunlop Tires ) , J. Walter Thompson ( Guinness Stout ) , branch offices of European steamship lines . A Manhattan public relations specialist , Hamilton Wright , reported drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,250 from Italy ( some of his advertising had been placed through a firm in which Presidential Son Elliott had been a partner ) . Rev. Dr. Alexander Cairns of Bloomfield , N. J. deposed that in seven months he had delivered 138 lectures at $25 apiece on behalf of Japan , which also employed Washington Lawyer Frederick Moore at $500 a month . Piquant were the names of Spain 's U. S. interpreters : for the Rightists . William S. Culbertson , onetime U. S. Ambassador to Chile and brother of Paul Culbertson , assistant chief of the State Department 's Division of European Affairs ; for the Loyalists , the New Republic 's Contributing Editor William P. Mangold , who got a number of Congressmen in trouble with their constituents early this year by persuading them to sign a greeting to the Loyalist Cortes ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) .
