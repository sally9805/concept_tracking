txt An organized drive which brought in between 60,000 and 80,000 new depositors was made by the Bank of United States in February , 1930 , at a time when the bank was already in a precarious condition and shortly after the State Banking Department had said so in a report to the officers , according to testimony yesterday by Morris White , a director of the bank , at the open hearing in the bank investigation conducted by Max D. Steuer . " This is the most startling testimony yet given , " commented Mr. Steuer . So completely was he taken aback by Mr. ' White 's revelation that he repeatedly asked Mr. White whether he was sure of his facts . Mr. White insisted he was and said that he himself had recruited his 1,400 employes in the army of new depositors . Other officers and directors of the bank , he said , brought in many times that number . Mr. White said that like other directors he knew nothing of the Banking Department 's critical report when he joined in the drive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not the majority , opened thrift accounts in the bank . Mr. White 's testimony was only one of several striking revelations developed at Mr. Steuer 's hearing yesterday . - Tells of Rothstein Loan . During the testimony of Reuben Sadowsky , another director of the bank , who preceded Mr. White , Mr. Steuer brought out that the late Arnold Rothstein , the gambler , , had received $132,000 of the bank 's money for which collateral consisting of stolen bonds had been put up . The bonds have since mysteriously disappeared . The money reached Rothstein indirectly through a loan to Wilbur Veitch , an associate . The loan has been on the bank 's books for eight years and no interest has been paid on it . Mr. Sadowsky was one of two endorsers of the loan without knowing itowas intended for the gambler . Through the testimony of Abe N. Adelson , president of the Abenad Realty Corporation , a dummy affiliate of the bank , it was brought out that minor officers of the bank had received loans illegally , through dummy affiliates or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling in the stock market . Mr. Adelson admitted that he , himself used money borrowed for his corporation to bolster his market operations . Capping yesterday 's developments was an announcement by Attorney General Bennett that directors of the bank had expressed to him their willingness to contribute financially and otherwise in a new plan that would give the depositors 100 cents on the dollar on their deposits either through a constructive liquidation or reorganization and reopening of the bank . Mr. Bennett mad this announcement after a conference with Mr. Sadowsky , who at the close of his testimony yesterday was urged by Mr. Steuer to go and tell Mr. Bennett how much he personally would be willing to contribute to assure the money of the depositors . Mr. Sadowski/ , would not commit himself but followed Mr. Steuer 's advice to see Mr. Bennett . At the end of his conference with Mr. Sadowsky , Mr. Bennett announced that the bank'director had promised to confer with other directors of the bank and report to him on Friday afternoon . Mr. Bennett said he hoped the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Attorney General 's office would cooperate closely with the State Banking Department for the protection of the depositors ' interests . He denied that the new move was in competition with the plan for reorganization and reopening of the bank submitted by the Rosoff reorganization committee and now being considered by Joseph A. Broderick , State Superintendent of Banks , and expressed the hope that it might be even possible to synchronize the two plans . First intimation of the new move in behalf of the depositors was given by Mr. Steuer when , in urging Mr. Sadowsky to go and see Mr. Bennett . he said : " qwq a movement to take the liquidation of the bank out of the hands of the State Banking Department and transfer it to the Attorney General 's office was discounted by Mr. Bennett 's statement that " we will be delighted to cooperate with the State Banking Department in the Rosoff plan or any other plan that will be of service to the depositors . " Pointing out that any plan agreed upon privately or with the cooperation of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Banking Department , Mr. Broderick welcomed the cooperation of the Attorney General 's office . " Any plan that is sound will get the preference , " Mr. Broderick said . " Sponsorship does not matter . " Mr. Broderick said also that negotiations on the so-called Rosoff plan are continuing , but that no official statement would be made until some definite result is reached . Mr. White 's revelation of the drive for new depositors came after he had testified as to his relations with the bank and the loans obtained by him and corporations under his control . These loans at one time totaled more than $1.500,000 . His debt to the bank at the time of its closing Dec. 11 , he said , was $750,000 , on which he has since made no payments . He said all he knew of the merger of the Bank of United States with the Central Mercantile Bank was what had been reported to the board of directors by the officers . but admitted that he knew that officers of the bank had bought Central Mercantile stock immediately before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutted . These rules require that deposits of a borrower must be at least 20 per cent of the loans received by him . " Were you as careful about the depositors ' business as you were about your own ? " asked Mr. Steuer . Mr. White made no effort at a direct reply . " What we are trying to find out is what the Bank of United States paid out millions for , and what the officers got for it ? " pressed Mr. Steuer in an effort to learn what it cost Mr. White to.finance a loan of $1,000,000 hetpbtained for one of his corporations . Mr. White replied that he paid the usual fee , from 7 to 10 per cent of the loan . He would not admit that the bank officers profited personally from such transactions . He denied that he used this money in purchasing bank units . This denial came after he had told Mr. Steuer that in July , 1929 , he had purchased 1,000 such units at a total of $215,000 . Admitting that he was , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Singer for trading in bank stock , Mr. White said that he had invested $100,000 in the syndicate , yet he was unable to give any information about the syndicate 's operations . " I only looked at the names behind the syndicate and the names were good enough for me , " he said , disclaiming any knowledge that the syndicate now owed 848,000 . He said that he had never been asked to pay his share of this debt . Unlike other directors , who have testified that loans of $12,000,000 to bank affiliates had been granted by the officers without knowledge or approval of the board of directors , Mr. White declared that he had been present at a meeting at which a loan of $4,000,000 , ostensibly to an affiliate , had been voted . This was before the aforementioned loans of $12,000 , - 000 to the affiliates , and Mr. Steuer appeared puzzled as to who received the loan mentioned . Since Mr. White did not believe it was for the City Financial Corporation , one of the affiliates which benefited by the $12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan was an entirely new discovery and may have constituted another deal open to criticism . Mr. White promised to search his records and clear up the mystery when he resumes the stand tomorrow . Got Employes to Deposit . It was at this point that Mr. White revealed that he had recruited his 1,400 employes in the drive for depositors last February . " And you gave them no protection , did you ? " inquired Mr. Steuer . " Did you make good the deposits of these depositors ? " " No , only . in a few cases , " replied Mr. White . " Only in the cases of those who asked me to do so . The others believe they will get 100 cents on their money . " " They do ! They 're optimists , " interjected Mr. Steuer . " Did n't you know the bank was in danger of failing when you brought in these new depositors ? " asked Mr. Steuer . " Why should the bank have failed ? " inquired Mr. White . " Because it had directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Well , other directors made a drive for depositors , too , and brought in from 60,000 to 80,000 depositors within thirty to forty-five days , " Mr. White explained . Mr. Steuer sat back astonished . " What ? After they had the 1929 report of the State Banking Department ? " " Yes , " replied Mr. White confirming the time element of the drive but denying any knowledge of the report , which reached officers of the bank In December , 1929 . " I think that is the most startling testimony that has yet been given , " commented Mr. Steuer , after making sure by repeated questions that Mr. White 's testimony was correct and asking him to confirm it again by a search of his records . Although he apparently played an innocent part in the transaction Mr. Sadowsky testified with reluctance on the loan , the proceeds of which went to Arnold Rothstein . The original amount of the loan was $150,000 , of which $18,000 has been paid by A. E. Rothstein , the gambler 's father . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadowsky described as a man of unquestionably high reputation , that the loan was negotiated . Veitch was to have received it and Arnold Rothstein was to have repaid it . It was endorsed by Mr. Sadowsky and Samuel Lamport . I. ' H. Phillips , a friend of A. E. Rothstein , also helped obtain it , Mr. Sadowsky said , pointing out that neither he nor Mr. Lamport nor Mr. Phillips had any knowledge of the ultimate destination of the loan . " In the Veitch transaction , Mr. Lamport and I. H. Phillips were told that a certain friend of ours was in trouble and with them I endorsed a note to give this party a helping hand , " Mr. Sadowsky said . " You never give anybody a helping hand by hiding a name , " said Mr. Steuer . " You and Lamport wanted to help Mr. Rothstein , a high type of man , as everybody will admit . But this loan was to be paid by Arnold Rothstein , and Veitch was the man who represented Arnold Rothstein ? " Mr. Sadowsky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the note had not been paid by Veitch because the collateral on the loan had been changed without his knowledge . Mr. Sadowsky added also that while he does not repudiate his share of responsibility for the loan , he would prefer to have the courts decide as to the liability of those involved in the transaction , including Mr. Veitch . Mr. Steuer then informed Mr. Sadowsky that originally the collateral on the loan consisted of deeds which had proven to be valueless , and that these were then substituted by bonds of mysterious origin . " You never heard , " said Mr. Steuer , " that Arnold Rothstein substituted bonds for the deeds , that it was later claimed these bonds were stolen and that now the bonds have disappeared ? " " That is news to me , " said Mr. Sadowsky . " You do n't know why those bonds can not be shown ? " Mr. Steuer inquired . " No. " replied the witness .

Extension of the bank inquiry to Brooklyn was officially announced yesterday by Attorney General Bennett following a conference with District Attorney Geoghan. of Kings County , Mr. Bennett appointed Ralph K. Jacobs , Assistant District Attorney , to act also as Assistant Attorney General in coordinating the State and county inquiries . The inquiry will be directed by Mr. , Jacobs and Israel H.

I wo n't discuss for the moment the details of this plan . My primary intention in this whole situation has been to help , In any plan that would give the depositors 100 cents on the dollar . I have felt all along the thing should start with the directors themselves ; that they are the men who should start the thing going . I told Mr. Sadowsky that Mr. Steuer and I would , of course , cooperate with him 100 per cent . Mr. Sadowsky left with the idea of calling a meeting of the directors and will report to me on Friday .
