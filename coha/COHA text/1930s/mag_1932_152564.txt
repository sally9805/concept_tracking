Ragweed began to ripen and send its pollen ( ten billion grains to the plant ) into the air last week . In consequence , some two million peculiarly sensitive residents of the U. S. began to snuffle &; weep with their annual attacks of hayfever . New York City , Chicago and smaller communities hired men to pull up every stalk of ragweed within city limits . For one day 's pulling Chicago paid 25 and a ticket good for a week 's room &; board in a charity shelter . Sales of home air filterers perked up . If his sleeping quarters are free from dust , the mildly sensitive hayfever victim will not suffer very much during the hours he must spend in open , unfiltered air . Allergists prepared for the annual autumn peak of their specialized practice . <P> Ragweed covers about 50% of the cases of hayfever in the U. S. Pollens from certain trees , grasses and weeds are just as irritating . Calvin Coolidge gets his annual attacks when grass begins to flower . At his last birthday July 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so ill that he went to bed for several days . He has been up &; around since . But he would not travel to Washington last week for President Hoover 's nomination party ( see p.7 ) . <P> Hayfever is closely related to asthma , hives , eczema , certain forms of food sensitivity , some forms of sick headache , occasionally colitis .
