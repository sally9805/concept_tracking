ON THE night of April 16 , 1939 , a Norwegian amateur astronomer named Hassel happened to glance skyward , and an unfamiliar wisp of haze in the constellation of Andromeda arrested his eye . When a short check-up showed that the intruder was a true heavenly body , Hassel realized that he had found a comet . He reported the discovery to the nearest observatory , from which the news was relayed to the world . Little or no information about Hassel is available at the present writing . But the comet he so fortunately discovered has proved to be the most brilliant since 1927 , and perhaps the most widely observed since 1910 , when Halley 's comet spread its fanlike tail across the heavens . Brilliant comets are rare . Only a small fraction of these objects attain naked-eye brilliance . That of 1927 was close to the sun and was seen by relatively few people . Although Hassel 's comet can not rank with Donati 's , Halley 's , or certain other great comets of the last century , it must nevertheless be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet was only slightly fainter than the North Star . Its light , instead of being concentrated into a single sharp point , was spread over quite an area , which made the comet appear somewhat less brilliant than it actually was . Several independent discoveries of the comet were made . Apparently it was first seen by two Russian amateurs , Jurlof and Achmarof , but the news of their discovery was not made  | available immediately . Officially , the comet will be known to astronomers by the compound name of Jurlof-Achmarof-Hassel . In the latter part of February , and again n the latter part of June , the comet passed within a few million miles of the earth 's orbit . Had the earth been in the neighborhood of either of these positions at the proper times , he comet would have been a magnificent raked-eye object . Its head would have apeared more brilliant than the brightest star a the sky , and its tail would have stretched alfway across the heavens . Actually the comet never came nearer the earth than about - ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions r the various parts of a comet . Neither head nor tail possesses a sharp boundary . There a short photographic exposure will now the comet as relatively small , a long exposure will lead to the recording of faint extremities and the comet will therefore appear larger . The comparative size shown in n illustration is only representative . It is obvious that the comet is a very extensive subject . The total amount of matter in a comet nevertheless extremely small . The comet 's head is believed to consist of a nucleus of meteoric matter ? rocks and fragments of dust ? surrounded by a tenuous aura gas . The pressure exerted by sunlight upthe material in this atmospheric fringe causes it to move away from the sun . The suiting effect is a cometary tail pointing rectly away from the sun . The gases shot out along the tail , like the smoke trailing behind a locomotive , are competely lost to the source . A cornet , therere , is always losing weight . Comets that - turn frequently to the solar neighborhood are quickly depleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comet , at certain times , has shown a remarkable tail structure . On at least one occasion the comet appeared to have two tails . The effect may , however , have been produced by a hollow , cone-shaped tail , like the fine spray from a garden hose . Analysis of the light from Hassel 's comet shows that its chemical composition is like that of the comets of the past . Among the materials present are the lethal gases cyanogen and carbon monoxide . The occurrence of these materials in Halley 's comet , when a collision was imminent between it and the earth , gave rise to the rumor that terrestrial inhabitants might be asphyxiated . Nonsense ! A comet is so nearly a perfect vacuum that the added quantity of the lethal materials would be imperceptible . Hassel 's comet , having passed its nearest points of approach to the earth and sun , is now receding toward the depths of transplanetary space , from which it came . Its orbit is probably a long ellipse . Eventually , some thousands of years hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
