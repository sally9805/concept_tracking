" Names make news . " Last week these names made this news : <P> " Deeply appreciative " was Mrs , Ewilda Gertrude Miller Robinson , widow of Arkansas 's late Senator Joe Robinson , when last week , at President Roosevelt 's request , she was appointed to the $6,000-a-year postmastership of Little Rock , Ark . <P> Under Ireland 's new constitution ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) its former President , U. S.-born Eamon de Valera , becomes Prime Minister . During a coast-to-coast broadcast from Hollywood last week , John McCormack , famed Irish-born tenor , offered himself as a Presidential candidate to succeed de Valera-providing 1 ) a naturalized citizen of the U. S. is eligible for the position and 2 ) the de Valera and Cosgrave opposition parties favor him . Said he : " Many of my friends in Ireland have written me to throw my hat in the ring . " <P> Into the offices of Maryland 's State Unemployment Service in Baltimore walked Nettie Mudd Monroe , widowed daughter of Dr. Samuel Alexander Mudd , the mild country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning after Booth shot Abraham Lincoln , and who for his apparently innocent treatment languished four years in Fort Jefferson at Dry Tortugas off Florida . Purpose of Daughter Nettie 's visit : to apply for an accountant 's job , so that she might earn $200 , enough to finish research for an authentic Civil War romance . Asked about her father , she answered : " When he died I was lost , and I have been lost ever since . " <P> The Principality of Liechtenstein , 65 square miles of territorial pie wedged between Austria and Switzerland , is ruled by 84-year-old Prince Franz I of Liechtenstein . Last week Prince Franz must have been personally alarmed by the nearby appetite of Nazi Germany-for his wealthy Viennese wife , former Baroness Gutmann , is of Jewish descent , and much of his property is in Austria . But for his country he professed unconcern , announcing : " We have no fear regarding foreign intervention ! " <P> Say , Jeff , we 're glad to see you back . <P> King of the ' boes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rods , the bumpers , too . <P> In fact , you 've went the whole route through . . . . <P> Thus acclaimed in Cincinnati last week by Tom Shea , poet laureate of the hoboes , was handsome , bald-headed Jeff Davis , head of Hoboes of America , Inc. and the International Itinerant Workers Union . The occasion : his coronation as king of the League of Hoboes of the World . Soon after the crown , conceived from the top of a coal-burning stove , had been placed on his head , said King Jeff : " This has a bolt inside , and it 's starting to puncture my scalp . " <P> Hissed , heckled , and occasionally cheered during a speech sponsored by Harvard University 's Young Conservatives last week , Rev. Gerald L. K. ( " Share the Wealth " ) Smith , erstwhile spiritual adviser to the late Senator Huey P. Long , declared that " rabble-rousing is needed to bring the country out of chaos , " urged that " a chair of rabble-rousing " be established at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
