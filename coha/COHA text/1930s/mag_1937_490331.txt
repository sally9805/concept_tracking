UN E-AIRN ESS-BEGINR-AT-HOM E. NOTE : In front of the Charity Organization Society , down on Fourth Avenue and Twenty-second Street , there walked a man carrying a placard which rend , " American Missionary Society Denies Human Rights . " MR . VALENTINE , our head cop , spoke at the Rand School the other day and mentioned the possibility of using the electric eye for traffic control . He said he could n't elaborate on it , but it was being tried in London . We can elaborate on it . A pair of electric eyes , so a friend of ours writes , were installed recently in Morden , on the outskirts of London , and are now enjoying a sort of unexpected popularity . The eyes are situated one on either side of a main road , in front of a school , and are so arranged that even a very small child , passing athwart the beam , will turn on a red signal and stop traffic . At the installation ceremonies , where the Minister of Transport made a speech , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy rush for the eyes , the signals worked admirably , and traffic was at a complete standstill for two hours . The dilemma has since been solved by retimploying the policetnan who used to he on duty at the corner before the electrical el-a set in . He and the eyes work as a team  --  the policeman keeps children from bothering the eyes , and the eyes keep cars from bothering the policeman . WE see by the papers that they 're thinking of bringing over the Blarney stone as a World 's Fair exhibit . It brings up a number of interesting problems . Suppose the stone does make the journey  --  will it be rigged up so that you have to he held upside down to kiss it ? If not , if it 's fixed so that it can be kissed more easily , will it take effect , so to speak ? Who will kiss it first , officially , at the Fair ? Grover Whalen ? And the sanitary angle : will stone-kissers have to wear gauze masks , or submit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or will the stone be rinsed with an American antiseptic between kisses ? In the latter event , whose antiseptic will he used. ? How chosen ? WE were interested in what Dr. Henry Seidel Canby had to say about English usage , in the Saturday Review of January 23rd . Usage seems to us peculiarly a matter of ear . Everyone has his own prejudices , his own set of rules , his own list of horribles . Dr. Canby speaks of " contact " used as a verb , and points out that careful writers and speakers , persons of taste , studiously avoid it . They do some of them because the word , so used , makes their gorge rise , others because they have heard that we sensitive Wry folk consider it displeasing . The odd thing is that what is true of one noun-verb is not necessarily true of another . TE ) - contact a man " makes us wince ; but to " ground a plane because of had weather " sounds all right . Further , although we are satisfied to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an automobile . " An automobile should not he " garaged ; " it should either be " put in a garage " or left out all night . THE contraction " ai n't , " as Dr. Canby points out , is a great loss to the language . Nice Nellies , schoolteachers , and underdone grammarians have made it the symbol of ignorance and ill-breeding , when in fact it is a handy word , often serving where nothing else will . " Say it ai n't so " is a phrase which is right the way it stands , and could n't be any different . People are afraid of words , afraid of mistakes . One time a newspaper sent us to a morgue to get a story on a woman whose body was being held for identification . A man believed to be her husband was brought in . Somebody pulled the sheet back ; the man took one agonizing look , and cried , " My God , it 's lied " When we reported this grim incident , the editor diligently changed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English language is always sticking a foot out to trip a man . Every week we get thrown , writing merrily along . Even Dr. Canby , a careful and experienced craftsman , got thrown in his own editorial . He spoke of " the makers of textbooks who are nearly always reactionary , and often unscholarly in denying the right to change to a language that has always been changing ... " In this case the word " change , " quietly sandwiched in between a couple of " to " s , unexpectedlyexploded the whole sentence . Even inverting the phrases would n't have helped . If he had started out " In denying to a language ... the right to change , " it would have come out this way : " In denying to a language that has always been changing the right to change ... " English usage is sometimes more than mere taste , judgment , and education  --  sometimes it 's sheer luck , like getting across a street . Ravished DURING last week 's snowstorm , two workmen were walking down Sixth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been replaced by wooden planking . The snow was kicked into slush as soon as it fell on the sidewalk , but it covered the wooden planks with a nice , white , inch-thick blanket . Suddenly , one of the workmen stepped off the sidewalk onto the unsullied snow , and walked ecstatically along , in his hobnailed boots . " Look ! " he said , leering at his colleague . " Footprints in the voigin snow . " Bowling Congress BOY , wait till we tell you about the thirty-seventh annual tournament of the American Bowling Congress ! It will be the biggest single athletic event in the world , if you count bowling as athletics ; 3,500 teams-20,000 people  --  are already registered , with more expected to turn up at the last moment . The tournament will be held at the 212th Coast Artillery Armory , at Columbus Avenue and Sixty-second Street , and will run from March 9th through April 30th . That makes fifty-three consecutive days of bowling . The hours will be from 8:30 in the morning until 2 the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 for each event ; and , since most bowlers enter all three events of the tournament ( singles , doubles , and five-man teams ) , this will bring the entrance fees to something like $250,000 . Around $150,000 will be awarded in prizes . Forty-five pin boys , each one of whom must have ten years of experience , will be employed , at $5 a day . Twenty-eight new alleys are being installed in the Armory , at a cost of $55 , - 000 . Thirty-five thousand new pins will be used up ( they 're changed after every game in an A.B.C . tournament ) , and these will cost $52,500 The Armory is to he decorated , in a modernistic manner , at a cost of $3,000 . The American Bowling Congress has taken out insurance of $300,000 , against possible injury claims by contestants Rental for the Armory is $8,000 . Running expenses are figured at $800 a day , including the salaries of various employees . Admission will be 50c , 75c , and $1 , and there is room for 2,672 spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been held in New York before . A bowling man who keeps his ear close to the ground told us that the " West-elm bowling interests " had campaigned against us , because they were afraid that , once the tournament came here , it would n't ever get back West . The 850 delegates who attended last year 's convention voted for New York by the smallish plurality of 46 . The man responsible was a Mr. Lattin , a printer with Wall Street connections , who in the past year sent out 15,800 letters to friends , bowling-team captains , league presidents , and so on , boosting New York . The expense of the whole campaign was $4,100 . Mr. Lattin weighs 340 pounds , and has bowled ever since he was a boy in Watkins Glen . The population of Watkins Glen is 2,956 , and it is 187 miles from New York . Mr. Lattin is by way of being a champion bowler himself . In 1929 , he won the Elks ' championship , rolling an average of 205 for 45 games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent about $60,000 of his own money to further the game Estimates based on past tournaments indicate that the average man at a bowling tournament spends $70 in the town where it is held . The Bowling Congress folk , doubling the estimate because New York is what it is , estimate that $3,000,000 will be brought in by howlers , to he divided up by theatre box offices , bars , and pretty ladies of the town . The bowling tournament gets more newspaper linage than any other sporting event , bar none . Fur example , two years ago , when the tournament was held in Syracuse , the Associated Press sent out 7,000,000 words . Bowlers always carry their howling halls in little black leather cases that look like bombs , so do n't worry if you think you see a lot of people with bombs . When the howlers arrive at the Armory for the opening ceremonies , they will find a huge papier-mache bowling ball in each of the 28 alleys . Presently , out of each of the papier-mache bowling balls , will pop  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockette will feel when she pops out of a papier-mache bowling hall and finds herself in the 212th Coast Artillery Armory , with 20,000 champion bowlers staring at her , we 're not in a position to say . Name IT was our privilege recently to see a I copy of an interoffice memorandum addressed to the staff of Warner Brothers by the publicity director : " Frank Prince will hereafter he known as Fred Lawrence instead of George Wells . ( This refers to Frank Prinz . ) " Ice and Opera THERE is a retired ice dealer of THER City , Thomas R. McDermott , who has the curious distinction of having heard more opera than anybody , living or dead , ever heard before . For twenty-seven years , from 1904 to 1931 , he did n't miss a single performance of the Metropolitan Opera , not excluding matinees , Sunday concerts , or Tuesday performances in Philadelphia . In more recent years , business conditions and ill health have forced him to limit himself to two or three operas a week , but his record is secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's not their habit to sit through a whole performance . Mr. McDermott is not much interested in the statistical side of his musical life , merely remarking , " I love opera , see ? So I go , see ? " Mr. McDermott lives in a frame house at 157 Highland Avenue , Jersey City . He is tall , rugged , silver-haired , and coy as a prima donna about his age . Like most great loves , his love of opera came at first sight . In 1898 , a friend took him to hear a performance of " Tristan " with Nordica as Isolde , Jean de Reszke as Tristan , and Edouard de Reszke as King Mark . Young Thomas was overwhelmed with delight . He immediately started commuting from Jersey City for every Wagnerian performance , taking his place among the standees , although he would usually be pretty well done in after a hard day among the ice cakes . ( The McDermott ice business , we should explain , was wholesale , and young Thomas was his father 's partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotti made his debut , and Thomas , who had by this time branched out to Italian and French opera , heard him . Thereafter Thomas never missed hearing Scotti sing , right up to Scotti 's retirement , in 1933 . That accounts for about 1,500 performances . By 1904 , the ice business was booming , and he quit fooling around ; started attending every performance . His favorite seats were in Row A of the Family Circle . Before long he was taking guests to every performance : five friends or relatives on Monday ; one on Tuesday ( to keep him company on the train to Philadelphia ) , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday nights , and Saturday afternoons ; and on Saturday evenings , five again . Sunday evenings the box-office people used to give him a whole box in the Diamond Horseshoe , much as a bartender will buy a steady patron a drink ; Mr. McDermott took advantage of this to invite six or seven guests . Often his opera bill would run around a hundred dollars a week , and as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see that he has spent a good hit of money . He used to fill in Sunday afternoons by attending Philharmonic concerts , and during the long , operaless summers , consoled himself with Stadium concerts . Naturally , Mr. McDermott used to be a familiar figure around the Met . He met all the singers , acquired a fine collection of autographed photographs , and on crowded evenings used to go out in the lobby and help keep the queue in order . Among composers , singers , and conductors , respectively , his gods are Wagner , Caruso , and Toscanini . " They did n't leave no room for nobody , see ? " He thinks that though Scotti 's voice was inferior to Caruso 's , Scotti was the better actor . His favorite opera is " Tristan " ( " The mightiest work ever conceived by the human brain , see ? " ) and he considers Jean de Reszke and Lilli Lehmann the greatest singers of the title riles . His favorite single piece of music is the funeral march from " Getterclamtnerung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd come to life . " Mr. McDermott deplores broadcasting of opera as much as he does ice cubes , and has never listened in on the Met . " You 've got to hear ' em in the flesh with the naked ear , see ? " he says . Another Chance AGIRL named Charlotte , who carries letters in her purse for days and days before she remembers to put them in a mailbox , tells us that recently she lost one . She just assumed that whoever found it would mail it , and forgot the whole matter . A couple of days later , though , the letter , upon which she had cautiously written her return address , came hack to her , enclosed in another envelope , with this note : I am returning this to you instead of popping it into the mailbox  --  remembering how I lost one once that I had decided not to mail . It arrived at its destination and caused a hell of a mess . Review Copies OOKS no doubt mean to you what they mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of long summer afternoons and winter evenings , of which we grow fonder and fonder as they become dog-eared with use . It will grieve you to learn what the professional hook reviewers do with the copies given them by publishers for review . They take them right down to 80 Fourth Avenue , before there 's the least chance of their becoming dog-eared , and sell them to a Mr. Schulte . Mr. Schulte invariably pays one-quarter the list price of a hook , and buys anything  --  hack love stories , children 's books , the latest Huxley or Maugham , expensive limited editions , detective stories , or technical expositions . The monthly income of a busy reviewer who sells all his review copies is about enough to pay the rent of a small apartment . We know all this because we have been down to Mr. Schulte 's place , which is just above Tenth Street ; shaken hands with Mr. Schulte and his silent partner , Mr. Pesky ; and inspected , superficially , his stock of a million-odd secondhand volumes ( not all review copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were told , the largest second-hand book store in this country ; largest in the world , for all they know . The partners are inclined to regret the review-copy end of their business  --  ties up too much money , they say . Standard practice is to ask half the list price for a book , but of course a great number of books wo n't sell at that price , and wind up on the ten-cent table . Publishers arc annoyed at their new books ' being offered at half-price , and Mr. Schulte says he does n't blame them . He does his best to mollify them by refusing to take advance orders for new books ; just lays them out on tables , on a first-come-firstserved basis . Best customers are small public libraries ; working on a slender budget , they find that it pays them to shop around in Schulte 's . Schulte 's buys the review copies of Lewis Gannett , Harry Hansen , Irita Van Doren , Isabel Paterson , Robert Van Gelder , Franklin P. Adams , Will Cuppy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Schulte collection of second-hand theological works is famous , and you 'll always see a divine or two looking around . ( Come to think of it , we have seen very few first-hand theological works . ) Mr. Schulte has had all sorts of dealings with the great , including Mr. Rockefeller , Sr. Mr. R. 's secretary called up once and said that he wanted a certain hymnal which he had used in Sunday School , long ago ; no expense was to be spared in getting a copy . Mr. Schulte just walked over to his ten-cent shelf , picked out the hymnal , and sent it around to Mr. Rockefeller with a bill for ten cents . Seizure ' - HIS was told us by a woman who takes dogs seriously , and is taken seriously in return by dogs . She says that the most trying time she ever had was with a cocker . The dog was so sensitive that if anybody patted any other deg in the family or even any person , the animal would throw a fit . On this account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , and when the dog was seized with convulsions she would give him a whiff . From these anesthetizations he would wake up feeling O.K. , and would be O.K. until someone patted another dog , or until the master of the house patted the mistress , whereupon the whole dreary scene would he reenacted . It told on everybody . The woman finally did the only sensible thing  --  gave the dog ( including the ether bottle ) to a friend who kept a fairly undemonstrative household , where one person seldom patted another . Right here is where a religious angle creeps into the story . The dog 's new owner was a Preshyterian lady , married to a Christian Science gentleman . The dog had a fit the very first day ( it seems some friends came in for tea and nobody gave him any tea ) . The lady whipped our the ether bottle , but her husband , seeing what she was up to , snatched it out of her hand . " I 'll handle this , " he said , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door , got out Mary Baker Eddy , and began to read in a quiet voice . His wife , terrified , tiptoed away . Half an hour later she put her ear to the door again , and could hear the dog still moaning , the husband still reading . After a while , though , both sounds ceased . The door opened , and there were the cocker and the Scientist , both O.K. The dog has been fine ever since , and anybody can pat , or pet , anybody . Widow MacLean IF you have driven up Fifth Avenue as far as 130th Street lately , you 've probably noticed that Widow MacLean 's house , last rampart of aristocracy in Harlem , is being razed . The city is going to make a playground there ; trucks are already grinding the lawn into mud . Thus endeth an occupancy of fifty-three years . Mrs. MacLean received the news of her eviction one day last September as she was sitting in her summer pavilion . It was a blow , but she took it stoically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her large staff of servants , to 1081 Fifth Avenue , overlooking the reservoir . We had an agreeable chat with her recently in her new home , among the palms and pedestalled bronzes which have long surrounded her . A spry lady of eighty-two , she told us some-thing about herself and the old house where she dwelt peacefully and stub-bornly in defiance of changing environs . She was born Marie Mott , daughter of Jordan L. Mott , head of the ironworks . ( You have of course seen his name on manhole covers . ) His foundry was in the Bronx , in the section named for him , Mott Haven . When Mark married Charles F. MacLean , a lawyer , her father bought her the house in Harlem , then a sylvan spot . The house had been built in the seventies by one Slippery Dick Connolly , friend of Tweed , but had never been lived in until the young MacLeans moved in . They lived in style , with servants , horses , gardens , and a line iron fence . On pleasant summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time soon began to work changes , though . Mr. MacLean became a Justice of the State Supreme Court . Harlem built up with Negro flats . The blocks adjacent to the Mott house became the fearful " lung blocks , " where tuberculosis took steady toll . But the MacLean mansion went right on , with its brick-and-slate carriage house , its shade trees , its air of gentility . While her friends were wondering why she did n't move away from the district , Mrs. MacLean was making friends with her colored neighbors . " Why should I have moved away ? " she said . " They never gave me anything but kindness all the years I was there . " justice MacLean died about thirteen years ago , and Mrs. MacLean came to be known to the colored folk as Widow MacLean . She was a generous and understanding person of con siderable charity , with a leaning toward the Y.M.C.A. , the Salvation Army , and various church organizations , both colored and white . Behind her home was the Negro church of St. Ambrose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depression she was a sort of a Lady Bountiful to the district : people would ring her bell and ask for work , and she seldom turned anyone away . Usually she would just invent work  --  shining the doorknob , sweeping the walk . She paid one fellow sixteen dollars a week , for many months , for sweeping the walk . She still provides a home for the two children of her father 's Negro coachman , and still maintains a considerable domestic establishment  --  a Filipino doorman , a German chambermaid , an Irish master-of-thehouse , a Chinese chef , a Scotch secretary , and some others . Does n't really need all these people , but it keeps them employed and it keeps her from getting lonely . Some of them have been with her for thirty or forty years , and obviously are very fond of her . She does n't kick much about her eviction , and she still will spend part of the year in her summer place at Rye , but in spirit she dwells in the old house in Harlem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children swinging in the breeze , and another New York landmark will be gone  --  almost as strange in its way as Ella Wendel 's house , where Kress now keeps a bazaar . ? OVERHEARD on a bus-top , from a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen : " If you can imagine going to a place like Syracuse , where there is no ability . "
