FEW of us realize that we have a war of attrition going on all about us . The ubiquitous auto-mobile claims its victims day after day , and yet the newspapers find neither news nor scandal in the fact that as many as 33,000 persons were killed by motor vehicles during the year 1930 , or four persons every hour , while approximately a million persons suffered either minor or serious injuries as the result of automobile accidents . Nor is the public generally aware that for the previous ten-year period there were 230,353 persons killed by automobiles , or almost twice the number of American casualties in the Great War . The sharp rise in fatalities may be partially accounted for by the larger number of cars in operation . Yet since 1926 the rise in deaths has been more rapid than the increase in registered cars , while for the year 1930 , automobile accidents of all kinds increased 12 per cent over 1929 , although the mileage covered by motor vehicles actually decreased 10 per cent , according to a study made by the Travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if motorists alone were affected , but it is a sorry fact that more pedestrians than motorists are killed by automobiles in the large cities . Manifestly , then , the devastation which the automobile is leaving in its wake has become a matter of vitalconcern to everyone who walks or rides on the streets . The public would doubtless profit from stricter licensing laws and traffic regulations , reinforced by widespread safety propaganda . Concerted efforts have been made in this direction during recent years by national automobile , insurance , and safety organizations , and it is to be hoped that they will meet with increasing success in the future . But it is a debatable question whether the accident rate can ever be cut down very far , since the automobile is essentially a dangerous instrument , and doubly dangerous when it is operated in congested districts . If , then , accidents are inevitable , the fatalities and the injuries which ensue present a grave social problem ; for after every accident the question arises as to whether the injured parties or their families have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wages , impairment of earning power , and finally , " pain and suffering . " Under the common law a person who is injured through the agency of another may hold the offending person liable for damages if the latter 's negligence can be proved in a court of law and there is no evidence to show that the injured person was also at fault . This is still the rule of law on which all claims for personal injuries resulting from automobile accidents are based . Presumably , therefore , if you have been injured in an automobile accident you should be able to collect damages provided you can show that the driver of the car which struck you did not exercise the caution that " a reasonable man " would have exercised and that there was no contributory negligence on your side . But in actual practice , unfortunately , collection of damages depends not only upon proof of negligence but also upon the capacity of the defendant to pay . It seems a fair assumption that most car-owners who have substantial businesses or who own property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own protection , so that if they should be held responsible for an injury to another person , the insurance company and not they would have to stand the loss . But there is a large class of motorists who own nothing of value beside their automobiles , and who are , therefore , unwilling to pay the premiums on liability insurance , which for the miniminn $5,000 policy run as low as $9 a year in certain rural territories but as high as $69 a year in a city of the size of Philadelphia , on the cheapest type of passenger car , and $103 in New York City on all types of passenger cars . Where a defendant motorist carries no such insurance and has no property that can be attached to satisfy a judgment , the laws in some of the States provide for the garnisheeing of his wages or salary . But when this is done the payment of damages drags out over a period of years and is perhaps never completed , for the sheriff 's shadow may so ruin a man 's reputation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your chances of collecting damages should you be injured in an automobile accident depend chiefly on whether the offending motorist is insured . The latest available figures indicate that in 1929 only 27 per cent of all the motorvehicles in the country were covered by public liability insurance , so that even if we allow for the fact that insurance is more common where traffic is heaviest and accidents are most numerous , still we must conclude that a very large number of victims will have only uninsured motorists to look to . And the chance of recovering adequate damages from an uninsured motorist is slim indeed . Nor is this the full extent of the difficulty . Even if you should be so fortunate as to have a claim against a car-owner who carries liability insurance , the adequacy of the amount you receive is likely to be in indirect ratio to the seriousness of your injury . That is to say , if you have suffered only a temporary disability , the insurance company may offer you more than enough to cover your doctor 's bills ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the insurance company will offer you will often fail to cover both your medical expenses and your loss of income . Should you refuse to settle with the company and take your case to court instead , you may in the end get a verdict for a more substantial sum ; but if you live in a large city you will be obliged to wait from one to three years for your case to come to trial , and you may have to turn over from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the damages awarded you to your lawyer . The injustice of the situation is apparent from the fact that thousands upon thousands of injured people and the families of those who have been killed are unable to collect a dollar of compensation , because the offending motorist is not insured , while others are obliged to accept the insurance company 's offer or else await the results of a long-drawn-out court action , and still a third group of people , who have suffered only minor injuries , collect from the insurance companies more than enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other inequalities inherent in the situation that a group of distinguished judges and lawyers three years ago formed themselves into The Committee to Study Compensation for Automobile Accidents , under the chairmanship of Mr. Arthur A. Ballantine of the New York Bar , at present Assistant Secretary of the Treasury . In the course of its researches the Committee employed investigators to make a house-to-house canvass of 8,849 personal injury cases in such disparate localities as New York , Philadelphia , Boston , Worcester , Mass. , New Haven , Conn. , rural Connecticut , Terre Haute and Muncie County , Indiana , and San Francisco and San Mateo County , California , Court records were also examined , an analysis of accident and insurance statistics was made , and conditions were studied in States which have enacted laws bearing on the compensation problem . The results of this inquiry have been published in a report which presents the first complete study of the automobile-compensation problem as related to personal injuries and deaths , as distinguished from property damage . II In its case studies the Committee has not attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt could have resulted only in a guess . Indeed the Committee 's own conclusions from its findings of fact indicate that the Committee itself does not regard the question of negligence as one of fundamental importance . At first blush it may seem to all of us who are rooted in Anglo-Saxon individualism that the wages of carelessness in the face of danger must be suffering if not death , and that society , therefore , is justified in washing its hands of the many motorists and pedestrians who court disaster through their own negligence . But this argument contains two fallacies . In the first place , it is often very difficult to fix the blame fairly for an accident that occurs in the space of a few seconds . And in the second place , the careless person who has been injured is not the only one who suffers ; his family may be left penniless , and the doctor , hospital , tradesmen , and landlord may be taxed accordingly ; so that the problem of how this loss should be met becomes a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of injured people which presents no important social problem consists of those who are disabled for a few days only . Even if they receive no compensation , they can manage to get along , as a rule , since their medical expenses and loss of wages are not heavy . In fact , if the owner of the offending car carries liability insurance , the accident may prove to have a silver lining , since the insurance company , anxious to effect a prompt settlement in order to preclude the possibility of the claim 's being litigated , often holds out as a bait to the injured person a tempting sum of money . This is good economy on the company 's part , since the expense of litigation , plus whatever damages a jury might award , would represent a still greater drain on their resources . It is well known that many ambulance-chasing lawyers take advantage of this dilemma in which the insurance companies find themselves , and threaten suits on behalf of clients who have been very slightly injured , if at all , and in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whether or not the claim is a bona fide or a fraudulent one , the injured person if his injury is slight ? often collects considerably more than he has paid out for medical care and lost in wages and he may spend this manna from heaven quite frivolously by way of celebration . When a woman in one of the localities studied was asked what she had done with the extra money , she said that she had " married the lodger and gone to Canada for three months . " Another had bought a washing machine , and a third had treated herself to a good permanent wave . The really unfortunate victims are the seriously injured , and the families of persons who have been killed . A housewife , for instance , is struck down by a passenger car and is laid up for six months with a broken pelvis , a fractured hip , and a double fracture of the leg . Her husband has paid out large sums in doctors ' bills , and she will be lame the rest of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the owner of the car which struck her was uninsured . In another city a tailor 's helper , who had been earning forty dollars a week , has been idle for a year as the result of an accident which injured his heart . He and his wife and three small children now subsist from day to day in a deserted barn . A similar story can be repeated over and over again in every American city , where injuries resulting from automobile accidents have thrown formerly self-respecting families into the indigent class . Single persons who are alone in the world also have a very difficult time when they are disabled . A nurse with an earning capacity of $150 a month is struck by a passenger car and incapacitated for six months . Her knee has been so injured that it gives way under her weight without warning , and her future income will be seriously curtailed . At the time of the investigation her loss in wages plus her medical expenses amounted to $1,350 ; and toward this amount the uninsured driver , more conscientious than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most tragic situations of all are to be found in families in which the sole wage-earner has been killed . Here is ayoung widow , the wife of a truck-driver who had been earning $R4 a week and who died as the result of an automobile accident after working hours . Receiving no compensation and burdened with hospital and doctors ' bills amounting to $800 , she goes to work for $18 a week , of which she has to pay $15 for her own and her children 's board and room . Still worse off is a widow from Scotland whose sixteen-year-old boy , her sole support , was immediately killed when he was driving with a friend and was struck by a car coming from a side street at a high rate of speed . As in thousands of other cases , the driver had no property and the widow was left penniless . A claimant fares much better when the owner of the car which did the damage is covered by public liability insurance , provided that the owner himself , or someone authorized by him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligence . But the claimant may have to wait months or years before collecting damages unless he is willing to come to terms with the insurance company . Adjusters for some of the companies follow the policy of offering a nominal sum immediately after an accident , on the theory that the injured person , or the family that has suffered the loss of a breadwinner , will be so badly in need of cash that they will accept a smaller sum than they would otherwise . Some claimants accept this offer . Others bargain for a larger amount , or perhaps file suit , but before the trial comes off they frequently settle with the adjuster , thinking that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . Some liability insurance companies are more liberal than others , but it must always be remembered that a stock insurance company is not a philanthropy , but is in business to make money for its stockholders . It should be remembered , too , that although the injury may be a serious one , the policy holder 's negligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages . In any event , there is no doubt that the damages paid in most of the seriously injured and fatal cases fall short of the losses of the claimants . Persons who have been so incapacitated that they can not work or have to change the nature of their occupation come off very badly indeed . Consider the ease of an automobile mechanic , still a comparatively young man , who was earning $35 a week when he received internal injuries in an automobile accident which made it impossible for him ever again to do heavy work . During the four months that he was completely laid up he had to borrow from friends and at the same time he fell into arrears on his rent . His losses up to the time when he went back to work for less money amounted to $1,100 . He was able to collect only $600 in damages . The compensation paid by insurance companies in death eases is in many cases smaller than the economic loss sustained . Enough is paid in most cases to cover the funeral expenses ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount paid may be pitifully insufficient from the family 's standpoint . A leather worker , for instance , who had been earning $40 a week , was struck by an insured passenger car while driving his own car ; he died after five days . At the end of four weeks the company made a direct settlement with his widow for U , 500 ? which was supposed also to cover compensation to herself for a slight injury sustained in the same accident . How far would ft500 go toward meeting the whole financial loss which she suffered from her husband 's death ? When claimants can afford to wait for the law to take its deliberate course they are generally able to collect largerdamages than when they settle outside of court , since juries are proverbially sympathetic with the victims of accidents . Indeed it must be admitted that many plaintiffs exaggerate their injuries and trade upon a jury 's credulity , and there is no question but that negligence litigation is all too often a cut-throat game with consciences stretched on both sides . But we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievance . They come off better in a court trial , it is true , but they may still suffer from several disadvantages . For one thing , the insurance company opposing them will be able to employ the highest-paid , the most skilled counsel ; and for another thing , the delays of the law are more likely than not to work against their interests , except when the full extent of an injury becomes apparent only after a period of time . A New York writer of my acquaintance suffered from both of these handicaps in bringing suit against another motorist who was represented by an insurance company . While he was driving with his wife and child on a Connecticut road that was jammed with cars rushing to a football game , his car was struck in a head-on collision by a speed-demon , who was convicted , as a result of the accident , of reckless driving and sentenced to ten days in jail . But the guilty driver suffered no other punishment , since he was not scratched , while my friend and his family were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the child had its nose broken and wrists injured . He himself had a badly lacerated scalp , several of his teeth were knocked out , and his limbs were badly bruised . For eight months he suffered acute pain , and there was hardly a day that a doctor was not summoned to attend one of the members of the household . Since the driver of the other car was insured , my friend 's lawyers advised him to bring suit in Connecticut rather than in New York City where the trial calendar is from two to three years in arrears . As a result his case was called for trial within eight months ; but by that time his contusions were no longer so evident as they had been , his child 's nose had been operated upon , his wife had returned from a sanatorium , and the chauffeur 's nose had been repaired , so that the family presented a less gruesome appearance than they had a month after the accident . It was the company lawyer 's cue , therefore , to deny that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disclaimed all knowledge of the fact that a doctor from his own company had called on my friend ten days after the accident and found him suffering from a hemorrhage that might have proved fatal if he had not been there to stop it . He admitted that there was something wrong with the plaintiff 's right knee , and he granted that he had lost several teeth , but he pointed out that these injuries in no way affected his earning power as a writer , since he was still of sound mind ! At the end of a four days ' trial , during which my friend was held up to scorn as a radical ( as if that had anything to do with the accident ) , the judge took the case under consideration , both sides having waived their right to a jury trial , and in the course of time he handed down a verdict for $3,500 , to cover the injuries which the entire family , including the chauffeur , had sustained . The $2,650 which was left after the lawyer had been paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend had written for doctors ' , surgeons ' , hospital , and drug bills . Yet it was a considerably larger sum than the insurance company would have settled for out of court , while if the daredevil driver who did the damage had not been insured , myfriend would have had to whistle for his satisfaction , as so many thousands of other people have had to do . Proceeding on the theory that the public should at least he protected against drivers who are known to be careless or reckless , eighteen States have passed so-called " financial-responsibility " laws . This legislation varies in character but its general purpose is to compel any motorist who has been at fault in an accident or who has been guilty of certain specified offenses against the motor vehicle laws , to give proof that he will be able to pay damages if he should be responsible for accidents in the future . This evidence usually takes the form of a liability insurance policy which covers the operation of his automobile by himself , or in some States , by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offending motorists be given demerit ratings by the Motor Vehicle Commissioner and divided into four classifications on which liability insurance premiums in that State may be based ; so that the driver who ran my friend down probably had to pay a higher rate when he renewed his policy , providing the Motor Vehicle Commissioner properly used his discretion . The financial-responsibility laws assume that the Motor Vehicle Commissioners in the various States , or their delegated officers , can in case of an accident which they have not witnessed call upon some sort of second sight , and say which motorist was guilty of negligence and which one was not . Such an impractical system is bound to lead to injustice . These laws , furthermore , are very difficult of enforcement , especially in a large State , for the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles has to follow up scores of automobile accidents every day and mail notices to the culpable motorist in each case , ordering him to produce evidence of his financial responsibility with respect to future accidents . if the motorist submits a certificate of insurance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that the policy is renewed or the installments paid . If the motorist in question is not insured he may choose to ignore the Commissioner 's first and second notices , and in that event an officer must be sent out to find him and take away his registration plates . Should the officer fail to locate him or be rushed with other business , the motorist may continue to use the highways for the rest of the year with comparative impunity despite the fact that he has not complied with the law . The next year he will be refused new registration plates and a new driver 's license , but it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he might apply for both under an assumed name . in a number of States the financial-responsibility laws contain a second clause intended to force a negligent motorist to pay a judgment , i.e. damages awarded by the court , on pain of losing his road privileges if he refuses to do so . But in Connecticut at least the figures do not indicate that this provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , between January 1030 and April 30 , 1931 , there were 88 complaints because of unsatisfied judgments : of these 16 were finally paid , 2 were nullified by bankruptcy , and as many as 70 were left unpaid ? suggesting that the defendants either evaded the law or got off the road for the time being . So far there is no conclusive proof that the financial-responsibility laws have diminished the number of accidents , despite the enthusiastic claims made in their favor . For in those States where the accident rate appears to have fallen the improvement can beattributed to the more careful administration of the motor vehicle laws , just as properly as to the financial-responsibility laws . No deductions can be drawn , either , from a comparison of accident rates in the financial-responsibility States with the rates in other States , since the number of accidents reported varies in every State with the system of reporting and the vigilance of police officers , while the actual number of accidents depends upon such local conditions as the proportion of rural population to urban , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highways , and the examination and supervision of drivers . In so far as the increase of financial-responsibility is concerned , these laws often lock the barn door alter the horse has been stolen . In other words , no motorist is required to insure the public against any injury he may cause until he has been involved in at least one accident or has violated a provision of the criminal law . The discipline that is meted out to him at that late date will be of little solace to an injured person with doctor 's bills to pay or to a family in want . If it were possible for the financial-responsibility laws to compel a defendant motorist to pay damages they would have real merit ; but their force in this respect is greatly impaired because they offer the guilty motorist the alternative of giving up his road privileges . In view of the increasing number of automobile accidents , it is unfortunate that our legislatures should play with half-way measures , while it would be perfectly possible to compel all motorists to carry liability insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compulsory liability insurance , as a matter of fact , is not an altogether new thing in this country , since at least forty States require taxicabs and buses to be covered by liability insurance for the protection of pedestrians as well as passengers , while twenty-four States require carriers of freight to carry the same type of insurance . But only one State so far has applied the principle to private passenger cars . That State is Massachusetts . There every resident car-owner is required to give proof of his ability to pay damages for personal injuries before registration of his car is possible . The insurance must cover not only the owner of the car , but any person allowed by the owner to use the car . The one weakness in the law is that it does not protect the citizens of the State against out-of-state machines and illicit cars on which the insurance has been cancelled , although the Registrar of Motor Vehicles believes that there are very few of the latter . As a result of this law it seems that the great majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some compensation in the course of time . In Boston the Committee 's investigators found that compensation had been paid in 92% of all fatal cases finally settled one way or the other , as against 56% in Philadelphia , and only 41% in New York . Where the claimant had been partially disabled for life , 94% of the Boston cases had received compensation , as against 71% in Philadelphia and 52% in New York . A number of cases had not yet been settled , but the Massachusetts investigation indicated that some compensation would eventually be received in 85% to 90% of all fatal and permanent disability cases . The Massachusetts law may be desirable from the standpoint of injured people , but the insurance companies insist that it has grave flaws . In one respect at least they have had a just grievance . When the law was passed in 1927 , empowering the State insurance commissioner to fix rates , this official made the mistake of fixing them at a figure which was too low . As a result the premiums collected by the stock insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating expenses plus claims and leave a reasonable profit , although a number of mutual companies , operating at less cost , were able to pay dividends . The rates for 1932 , have been raised to a level slightly higher than the rates of 1926 , but probably not high enough to take care of the rising curves of losses . It is also claimed that the Massachusetts law tends to increase accidents in that it relieves all drivers of the fear of being held personally responsible for any injuries they may cause . But the same argument applies to all liability insurance , including that taken out under financial-responsibility laws . And since it has not been proved that insurance encourages careless driving , it would be folly to deprive the public of this form of economic protection . A more justifiable criticism of the Massachusetts law is that compensation cases tried in the courts are held up for a longer and longer time , since the volume of motor vehicle accident litigation has increased greatly since 1927 . In Suffolk County , for example , the delay from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in 1929 to 363 .. / months in 193 . In some jurisdictions auditors have been appointed to hear motor vehicle cases with the consent of the parties involved ; and unless this practice proves acceptable , delays may become intolerable . To sum up , the Massachusetts law has enabled more claimants to collect compensation than in any other State .. But settlements and trials are delayed just as long as they are in other States ? trials sometimes longer . The damages paid are , of course , on the whole no more adequate than in other States , because the great majority of cars which cause accidents are insured . If legislatures wished to go so far as to guarantee to victims of automobile accidents prompt compensation commensurate with the gravity of their loss , they could do so by scrapping the common law negligence theory and passing legislation similar to the Workmen 's Compensation Acts . Twenty years ago a workman who was injured in the course of employment could collect compensation only by proving that the accident was solely his employer 's fault , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer and await the results of a court trial . In order to remedy this situation practically all of the States have passed legislation which entitles a workman to damages for any injury incurred from an accident in the course of employment regardless of whose fault it is , while all employers are required to pay premiums to support the compensation fund . When a workman is injured , therefore , he simply has to appear before a State Board and prove the facts of his case in order to collect a stated amount of compensation which will be directly proportionate to his wages and the gravity of the injury he has sustained . Recourse to the courts is not open to either employer or employee except as an appeal from the decision of the Board . The principle of the Workmen 's Compensation laws is now so well established that the Ballantine Committee in the course of its report has presented a tentative plan based on the provisions of the New York Workmen 's Compensation Act , to demonstrate how such a system might be applied in the automobile field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all persons disabled for over a week and to the dependents of any person killed as the result of a motor car accident . No compensation , however , would be paid to the operator or the owner of a car when there was no other car involved in the accident , nor to any person who willfully caused an accident . Damages would include , in addition to funeral expenses up to $200 and medical costs , compensation for loss of wages , for death , or for disfigurement . A man who was totally disabled for life would receive two-thirds of his weekly income for the rest of his life , if this amount did not exceed $25 a week . Or if he was disabled only temporarily he would receive the same amount until he resumed work . In case he was crippled , or in some way partially disabled for life , he would receive two-thirds of the difference between the wages he earned before the accident and after , up to $20 a week . Under such a provision a carpenter whose earnings dropped from $55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , would have been paid , in addition to his medical expenses , the maximum of $25 a week while he was laid up , and $16.66 a week for a period similar to that provided by the New York workmen 's compensation law . In fatal cases compensation would be paid wherever the deceased left dependents , the amount varying with the wages that he had been earning and with the number and ages of the dependents . For example , the widow of the leather worker mentioned above , who was paid $2,500 by the insurance company , would have received $8,701 under the proposed plan . Death benefits generally , if awarded on the same scale as under the New York Workmen 's Compensation Act , might be expected to average about $7,500 for earners with dependents ? a very much higher average than is now collected from insurance companies . The payments outlined above are all based on the liberal provisions of the New York Workmen 's compensation law and would entail the payment of premiums somewhat higher than those now paid for liability in Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the Massachusetts Workmen 's Compensation Law , the premiums would probably be less than those now paid for liability insurance in Massachusetts . It is obvious that the amount of the premiums would depend on the liberality of the plan . The advantages of the plan are apparent . ( 1 ) Cases could be handled with despatch by a State administrative board , since the difficult question of negligence would not have to be considered , and the first payment could be made within three weeks in most instances . ( 2 ) Compensation would be received in every case of injury or of death leaving dependents , and the amount would be in proportion to the loss sustained . ( 3 ) The total moneys paid out for compensation would be more fairly distributed than at present : more would go to the fatal and permanent disability cases , and less to the temporary disability eases . ( 4 ) Attorneys ' fees , which absorb from 25% to 50% of the damages in a large number of all cases where anything is collected , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The courts would be relieved of a great mass of litigation which is handled most unsatisfactorily at present , since proof of negligence is a tenuous thing in most cases , and even conscientious juries find it difficult to arrive at the truth . At the same time the plan has drawbacks . For one thing , it might tend to increase the fraud that is per petrated against insurance companies , since every automobile accident would afford an opportunity for collection of damages . Claims would be exagger ated , and the physicians on the Board would have to check the extent of injuries very carefully . The objection has also been raised that even so liberal a scale of compensation as the one proposed would be far too low to compensate an injured person who has a higher than average earning power , and it is argued that it would he unjust to prevent such a person from suing for as large a verdict as he could collect ? assuming that he had a claim against a defendant who was heavily insured or was a man of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a better than average income can well afford to carry accident insurance , and that while he might possibly suffer an injustice if he were injured and could collect only a stated amount of compensation , the great majority of injured persons would be better off under a compulsory compensation law . A good deal has been said and written as to the constitutionality of a compensation plan applied to automobiles . The question is whether such a plan would deprive anyone of property without due process of law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution . The Committee 's report contains a careful discussion of this question , from which it is concluded that the plan would be constitutional . There are in some State Constitutions , however , clauses prohibiting any limitation on amounts to he recovered for death or injuries . In these States constitutional amendments would be required to make a compensation plan possible . If such a system were put into effect , the insurance companies would have to pay claims according to a statutory scale , and , unless a competitive State fund were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , since they would have become in effect a public utility . It would remain to be seen whether the private companies could do business at a profit . At least they would be relieved of the heavy expense of litigation and the disproportionate payments which they are now obliged to make in cases of minor injuries . A change of some kind in the law is clearly indicated . As matters stand to-day , in every State but Massachusetts the motorist who has no record is left free to decide whether he will insure the public against any damage to human life that his machine may cause . This state of affairs is wrong . No motorist should be allowed upon the highways unless he carries insurance for the protection of the public . Whether this insurance should take the form of compulsory liability insurance , like that in Massachusetts , or of compulsory compensation insurance , is a matter for the State legislatures to decide . The former system preserves the ancient Anglo-Saxon tradition that every man must stand on his own two feet and be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the delays incident to bargaining with the insurance company or obtaining a court verdict may work a real hardship on theinjured person or bereaved family , while the disparity between the damages which an insurance company may think are due a claimant and the amount which the claimant may need to keep body and soul together is often so great as to constitute a real social problem . The compulsory compensation plan , on the contrary , proceeds on the theory that in so tightly packed a civilization as ours it is difficult and often impossible to mark off one man 's rights from another 's , and that , therefore , justice must be meted out on a large scale and not in terms of individual cases . Certainly if the State is going to permit an increasing number of cars , often driven by irresponsible people , to choke the highways , it owes all of its citizens ? not forgetting those who still care to walk ? at least a guarantee of money damages if they fall prey to one of these dangerous instruments . Granted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all those who use the automobile for pleasure or profit should be compelled to contribute to a fund for the relief of those who are sacrificed to this relentless god of the twentieth century .
