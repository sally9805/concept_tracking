Last September Ottilie followed him to Manhattan , married him . George got a room in The Bronx by working as a janitor . A child was born , died of malnutrition . Then George lost his janitor 's job . Because he was an alien illegally in the U. S. , he could not apply for relief . The couple moved to the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River , where they went on starving . They rigged up a tent , pitched it each night in Palisades Interstate Park , struck it at dawn to avoid arrest for vagrancy . George picked up odd jobs . When the tent began to fall apart and bad weather set in last week , the Umbachs moved to a 4-ft. cement culvert that drains rainwater from the Palisades slopes into the Hudson . <P> One rainy day last week George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trickles draining into his culvert home . Ottilie was housekeeping inside the culvert . Suddenly a wall of water appeared coming fast down a drainage trench . It roared past George , swept up Ottilie , smashed her against a curve in the culvert , carried her on to the screen at the culvert 's end . Police found her body , every bone broken . Said George : " I 've wept so much in two years I have no tears left . " <P> <P> <P> Fortune On Manhattan 's East Side , a rumor of an uncle who had died six years ago in South Africa leaving a $17,000,000 fortune burst on the tenement home of Abraham Starr , 58 , impecunious Polish-Jewish ironworker , his wife Leah , his seven grown children and brood of grandchildren . The facts were that a Montreal lawyer had seen in the hands of a stranger a Polish newspaper listing the will of one Harry Koslack or Kozack who had bequeathed at least $1,000,000 , maybe $6,000,000 , to his sister who had married a man named Stareselsky .

It looked good to the lawyer , to the Montreal Starrs , to Abraham Starr , to the newspapers . But by that time the stranger had disappeared with his Polish newspaper . <P> Over the Manhattan Starrs ' little flat and blacksmith shop swarmed a scourge of salesmen . Mother &; Father Starr protested , " We still work until we get the cash . . . . Then , maybe mama and I go to Palestine like all good Jews want to do . " <P> Finally a South African law firm cabled that a man named Kushlick had died in 1929 , leaving his wife and five children $6,000 . <P> Said Mother Starr : " Now I can get some sleep .
