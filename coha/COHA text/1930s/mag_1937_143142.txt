Prime golfing axiom is that a medalist rarely wins a tournament . Last year in the U. S. Women 's Championship at Summit , N. J. , Medalist Mrs. Estelle Lawson Page , according to everybody 's expectations , did not survive the third round . This year at Memphis , again medalist in the women 's national tournament . Mrs. Page refused to be flustered , stayed calm even through such matches as one in which her opponent after a lusty swing lost her skirt . So last week Mrs. Page met 19-year-old Patty Berg , runner-up to Mrs. Glenna Collett Vare in the national tournament two years ago , in the final . <P> After the morning round it was apparent that Patty Berg , favorite with sportswriters because of her snub nose , would be only runner-up again . Playing in a faded blue jersey and battered felt hat with tees stuck in the hatband . Mrs. Page was 3 up at the end of 18 holes . Imperturbable , one-putting on green after green . Mrs. Page was 7 up at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was just my day , I guess , " she said . <P> Most women golfers good enough to try for the U. S. championship are persistent matrons like Mrs. Opal Hill of Kansas City , who was playing in her 13th national tournament last week , or enthusiastic youngsters like Patty Berg . Mrs. Page , 29 , is neither . Wife of an accountant in Greensboro . N. C. she first took up golf for her health , has played only six years . <P> Memphis society was reported disgusted with the visiting golfers , found them too preoccupied with golf for cocktails and dinner parties . The U. S. Golf Association was disgusted for another reason . Southern golf addicts willing to pay $2.20 to see able women golfers eliminate each other had been disappointingly few . It seemed probable last week that the first women 's national championship to be held in the South would also be the last for a long time .
