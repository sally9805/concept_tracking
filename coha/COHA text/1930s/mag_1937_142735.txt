Britain owns all the oil , developed and undeveloped , in Southern Iran . She controls one-third of Venezuela 's output , two-thirds of Mexico 's . She has an oil company in the U. S. <P> After the U. S. , Britain is the world 's largest oil consumer . But only recently did she suspect that she might have fairly large quantities in her own island cellars . <P> Britain has yet to find out how much or how little oil she has downstairs , though the first important strike was made at Hardstoft , Derbyshire , in 1919 when oil was discovered about 3,000 ft. below a field of oat stubble . About 100 tons a year have since been produced . Encouraged by this small but steady uninterrupted gush , the Government in 1934 established State ownership of all domestic oil , hoping to make the Navy independent of foreign supplies . Enthusiastic geologists soon began to talk of the possibility of finding oil along a belt stretching from the west coast of Wales to the east coast of Yorkshire , and in Somerset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellingly , Sussex , brawny workmen employed by Anglo-American Oil Co. began to drill with up-to-the-minute apparatus capable of boring more than a mile . Present with intense official interest was Lord Apsley , representing the Minister for Coordination of Defense . Some time in August , Britain will get another check on her home oil potential .
