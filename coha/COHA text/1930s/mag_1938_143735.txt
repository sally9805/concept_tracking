About four miles from Spring Green , Wis. , the hills splay into two soft ranges to let a fast stream flow toward the Wisconsin River . Facing southwest over this valley a big , long house folds around the summit of one hill , its roof lines parallel to the line of ridges , its masonry the same red-yellow sandstone that crops out in ledges along the stream . Under snow the house melts easily into the landscape . Its name is Taliesin , a Welsh word meaning <P> " shining brow . " Its history is one of tragic irony . Its character is one of extraordinary repose . It is the home of Frank Lloyd Wright , the greatest architect of the 20th Century . <P> For the past five years Taliesin has been a workshop , farm and studio for more than a score of apprentices who are interested in architecture as Frank Lloyd Wright understands it . During its first winter the Taliesin Fellowship spent most of its time cutting wood in two shifts to keep the fires going . Since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade , the master of Taliesin has again had work in hand . In California , Texas , Wisconsin , Minnesota and Pennsylvania superb new buildings have grown from his plans . Last week the significance to modern architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright 's new buildings was recognized in an issue of THE ARCHITECTURAL FORUM which broke all precedents for that magazine . Its main body of 102 pages , Lid out and written by Architect Wright , was an album of his work , an anthology of sturdy quotations from Thoreau and Whitman , and a compendium of Weight 's building philosophy . <P> To the U. S. man-in-the-street 15 years ago , the name Frank Lloyd Wright meant , if anything , the builder of a hotel in Tokyo which by some engineering magic withstood the great earthquake of 1923 . To the U. S. man-in-the-subway , his name was associated with scandalous episodes ground from the inhuman human-interest mill of the tabloid newspapers . A decade ago , when the brand-new International Style in architecture was seriously taken up by U. S. architects , many of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before , that by great European architects such as J. J. P. Oud and Mies van der Rohe he was regarded as a master spirit . In 1932 Wright published his Autobiography , a book which combined magnificent self-revelation with the most stimulating discussion of architecture ever heard in the U. S. <P> Natural Builder , The valley in which Architect Wright lives was settled by his Welsh grandfather when it was wild . Wright was born there and grew up on the farm of one of his uncles . His first adventurous piece of architecture was a windmill . He felt and has developed a stronger sense of the earth 's reality than most poets . Wright has conceived himself a participant in Nature , not a communicant . " Man takes a positive hand in creation , " he has said , " whenever he puts a building upon the earth beneath the sun .
