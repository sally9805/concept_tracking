txt New York City 's assessed valuations , which have been climbing steadily year by year , will be reduced drastically , probably to the extent of $1,500,000,000 or more , to ease the burden on the city 's taxpayers , it was said in authoritative quarters yesterday . The prospective reduction is about 714 per cent of the total . The information was in line with the declaration made by Mayor Walker in his pay-cut speech to the city employes last Friday night . The reduction is regarded as necessary to prevent defaults in taxes that might imperil the soundness of the city 's tax levy for 1933 . The Mayor said assessments would be reduced , but he specified no figure in his speech . The figure of $1,500,000,000 , it is understood , was discussed by Mayor Walker in conferences with James J. Sexton , president of the Board of Taxes and Assessments . It would reduce the amount of the assessed valuation of the real estate in the city from $19,977,096,315 , the figure for this year , the highest in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basic tax rate for the city in 1932 was $2.59 for each $100 of assesed valuation , and were the same tax rate to prevail the coming year the saving to the city 's real estate owners would be $38 , - 850,000 . However , a reduction in the tax rate is regarded as likely under the Mayor 's economy program . Charles L. Kohler , Budget Director , announced yesterday . that city expenditures this year already had resulted in a saving of $15,000 , - 000 of money appropriated in the 1932 budget . This , he explained , obviated the necessity of issuing tax notes for other purposes and thus worked to reduce the 1933 budget , in which the tax notes would have had to be redeemed . He expected , he said , to pare an additional $15,000,000 from the departmental estimates , exclusive of the $26,000,000 to be saved by the voluntary pay cut of city employes and the money that can be left out of the budget because of the expected modification of the Delaney plan of short-term financing of subway construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate , is expected to coincide with the reduction of $75,000,000 in the budget for 1933 that is confidently awaited by the realty men who have conferred on the subject with Mayor Walker . The $1,500,000,000 reduction in assessments , it appeared last night , would not be altogether satisfactory to the leaders in the fight for relief of the burden on real estate . Anton L. Trunk , president of the Real Es ' tate Board , declared that he personally would continue to fight for a greater reduction , possibly between two billions and three billions of dollars . His organization will fight for the reduction in assessments , rather than being content with splitting the savings between reduced assessments and a reduced tax rate , because of the fact that the tax rate can be advanced a little , year by year , easier than assessments , which can be pro ' tested to the Board of Taxes and Assessments and carried from there to the courts on appeal . More Accept Pay Cuts . Meanwhile more city employes made known their willingness to accept the pay cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controller Frank ' J. Friel , however , that in at least one department  --  the Fire Department  --  the men had been coerced into assenting " unanimously " to the cut . This was denied immediately by Fire Commissioner John J. Dorman . Mr. Kohler said that the city 's budget would be drawn up on the assumption that the employes ' would assent unanimously to the reduction and that , if they dirt not , the city would have recourse to Albany to get there the legislation that would legalize the action of the ' administration . The reduction in the assessed valuation of the property of the city will be the first within the memory of anyone at City Hall . The rise has been greatest in the past ten years . and the constant increase was used as the argument for the Delaney short-term bond financing plan when it was introduced . The contention was advanced that the increase in values would take care of the extra amounts that had to be put into the debt service item of the budget , because of the short amortization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contention of the administration until the slump in realty values in 1930 . The figures for the last four years are as follows : 1932 19,977,096,315 1931 19,162,517,014 1930 18,583,987,402 1929 17,445,731,435 Nearly all of the increase of the 1932 figures over 1931 is accounted for by the expiration of tax exemptions in 1931 , putting some $700,000-000 more of real estate under the tax levy . Mayor Promised Relief . It is understood that assurances of a cut of the amount specified were given by the Mayor to realty representatives , after they had told him what relief the city 's realty must have . The only reason that tax payments to the city have not fallen off any more than they have , it was said yesterday , was that a large number of properties had been taken over by banks , and other interests , and in each case the interest taking over the property had had to pay up the tax arrears to the city , the taxes being the first lien on the property . In making the reductions , in the city budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is understood , has had in mind the attitude of the bankers to whom the city must go for its short-term loans each year , regardless of longterm borrowings . The short-term loans are necessary to tide the city over from the first of the year , when the new budget starts , to the middle of May , when tax collections begin . The attitude of the bankers has been that loans must be made with regard to .. the soundness of the institution , private or municipal , and threatened strikes on the part of taxpayers , . or ; defaults by large numbers of real estate owners , would impair the soundness of the tax levy , which is based on the assumption that the taxes will be paid . PLANS SCHROEDER INQUIRY . Citizens ' Group Seeks Ways to Cut Costs in Sanitation Board . The Citizens Budget Commission probably will investigate the expenditures of the Department of Sanitation to recommend possible Yeductions in costs in this branch of the City Government , it was disclosed yesterday . Trustees of the commission , meeting yesterday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discussed plans for such an investigation , in the belief that material cuts might be effected without affecting the services of the department . They also began a study of the lighting costs of several other municipal departments with the aim of suggesting where savings might be made , particularly in " certain institutions , ' and continued their previous discussion on subway financing costs and the feasibility of substituting long-term obligations for fouryear bonds as a means of reducing the budget . Final decision on the proposed investigation of sanitation costs will be reached at a meeting of the trustees next Tuesday in the commission 's offices , 350 Madison Avenue . The organization expressed itself as opposing the suggestion of Commissioner William Schroeder Jr . for the imposition of a special sewer tax . Peter Grimm , the chairman of the board , announced that the commission probably would make public within a week the findings of its technical staff , under the direction of George , on how and to what extent savings might be made by a change in the city 's methods of subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various items making up the 1933 budget and expects to announce shortly the places where reductions ? are practicable . Mr. Grimm said . " Although a good deal has been said recently by the Mayor and others concerning the possible refunding of short-term subway bonds , it was felt that the public probably does not have a full picture of the situation and suggested changes , " he added . " We hope that our investigation and explanation will clear up these questions . " The trustees .. also discussed , yesterday Mayor : Walker 's recommendation for a pay cut for city employes , but delayed comment " until we see how the Mayor comes out with it and how the employes respond .
