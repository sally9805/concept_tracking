I was so scared the train might get started and you get left : " Grandma , with small cotton-gloved hands , took the basket and smiled up at a gray-mustached man in a velvet-collared , checked overcoat and black derby . " You 'd think , would n't you , many times as I 've come down to this depot , I could get on a train without going off and leaving some of my luggage . Wo n't you sit down ? " " Thank you , " the man said , " thank you . You know , I 'm glad you did forget that basket . When you got on the train right away you reminded me of someone I used to know when I was a boy , someone in whose house I spent some of the happiest hours of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I 'm pleased to recall something , someone pleasant to your mind , " Grandma said . " You did just get back on in time , did n't you ? I do n't know how I 'd 've managed without that basket . It has the fried chicken in it and the things I 'm taking the children , son Howard 's children . I always take the two telescopes , and last night after I got the other one packed and started to heft it up on to the little hall table , to have it ready there by the door for this morning , what happened but the handle pulled right owl " " And have n't you a harness shop in town that could have fixed it ? " " Oh , yes , we 've got a harness shop , but really that telescope needs mending with a new one . A neighbor came over and offered me this basket and ' twill serve very well , That reminds me of a thing that was told me once by a woman I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket does . She said one time she was going some place and she had all the children and when she 'd got on the train she looked out the train window and there sat a little girl in the doorway of the depot , in a blue bonnet , the bow tied under her chin , so neat and her hands folded in her lap , just sitting there , sweet as could be , and she said to herself , the children climbing round her and making a racket and asking questions , ' My , I wish I could see one of my girls , all ready to go some place and sitting like that . She 's a lovely quiet child , ' and then she looked round on them and one was missing and sure enough , it was one of her girls ! My , you dress a bunch of young'ns ready to go some place and you do n't have time to stand round and look them over . I can see how it happened all right . " " You travel quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose you might say I do , " Grandma said , taking off her bonnet and smoothing her hair . " You see , Mr. Davidson left me my pass so I travel free and there 's nothing to hold me to home . Winter or summer , if I feel moved to go see one of the children or if they send for me ( I 've seven children , all married and in their own homes and now some of their children have homes too ) , I 'm free to go . I have only a cat and I own him jointly with a neighbor ; he 's as at home one place as the other and does n't miss me . " Grandma opened her alligator handbag to get out her pass for the conductor . " How do you do , Mrs. Davidson ? " he asked kindly . " Where 's it to this time ? " " Out to Howard 's , " Grandma told him . " Two years since I 've been out there . " " Well , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pr eciuus pass . " That 's a nice bag , " the stranger remarked . " Yes , is n't it ? " Grandma agreed . " The children gave it to me one year when three or four of them were still at home . When I was out at Howard 's last , the pup  --  those children had a spaniel pup  --  got hold of it and chewed and half tore the flap off it . Howard took it down to a shop and they sent off for the leather , the alligator-hide piece , and put a new flap on it . Howard stood for it himself and it must have cost him a pretty penny . He never would tell me . " " It 's a fine piece of work , " the stranger said . " I notice because I 'm in the leather business , in a way , myself . I 've got a harness factory . " He reached in his pocket for a tooled-leather cardcase and offered Grandma one of his cards , a large card with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his name above : James Haverfield , and below : Harness Factory , Cleveland , Ohio . " Well , that 's fine , " Grandma said . " Three of my children arc on farms , and two that live in town drive , and they must buy a good bit of harness among ' em . I 'll look into it and see what kind they use , and if they 've not got your harnesses already , I 'll tell them about you and have them keep the trade name in mind . " " Thank you , " the man replied . " You know , this is a kind of sentimental journey for me to-day , and it seems right Ishould have met a woman like you , for you fit right in with the kind of memories I was having . You see I used to live out this way . I used to live in the little town of New Orchards . Do you know that town ? Well be coming through it . " " Well , no I do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on my last trip out to Howard 's , couple of years ago , who lives in the country near there , and I remember how it looks from the train ; are n't there maple trees and is n't there a big white house set well up on a hill , with maples round it ? " " Right " the man exclaimed excitedly . " Right . That 's just the way it is and I 've not seen it in almost thirty years , twenty-nine , to be exact . That house is the doctor 's house , the finest house in town . There were some cost more , but none so well built and fine . " " And the doctor 's gone ? " " Yes , yes , years ago , and his wife too . But Ellen 's there . Ellen 's still there in that old house . " The man looked away , over the roiling pastures , clapped his hands on his knees and turned his head slowly , rememberingly , from the window to Grandma and sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he laughed . " That is what I used to call her ; ' To wed the fair Ellen of young Lochinvar ' ? do you remember ? " " Law , yes , " said Grandma , " I 've helped more than one of my children learn that poem . It 's got a Iot of spirit , do n't you think ? Ellen was this doctor 's daughter ? " " No , no she was n't . She was a child they adopted . They had none of their own . They treated her just like a daughter though . For a long time I thought she was their daughter . I used to watch her going by the shop to school , with her hair hanging loose down her back , like girls wore it then , and a sailor hat on her head . She had a plaid skirt and a little black velvet jacket and cloth-topped boots . Black hair . " " You were working in a shop when you ought to have been in school ? " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRANDMA AND THE SENTIMENTAL TRAVELER 241 home when I was eleven ; could n't get on with my stepmother , and got apprenticed in a harness shop . One day I cut my hand  --  bad  --  and the man I worked for , a big Dutchman , told me to run on up to the doctor 's and have it dressed . 1 went running along , 1 guess I was about sixteen , and my hand inside the front of my shirt , because I had no handkerchief , and by the time 1 got up that drive to the house the whole front of my shirt was a sight , for blood . " They had a knocker , a brass one , shaped like a woman 's hand and on a hinge , and I stood there knocking and knocking . At last Ellen came running to the door and when she saw me she cried out and I was so scared , speaking to her , I could n't get a word out , and she thought I was hurt so bad I could n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that was the doctor 's office then , and dressed my hand , washed and tied it up . It was the thick of my hand I cut , here , above my thumb . The doctor was out and his wife was out . There was no one there but Ellen . She ran and brought one of the doctor 's shirts , a stiff-bosomed shirt , and made me get into it and then came back in the room , turned the cuffs back for me and pinned them . She had on a blue dress and a blue ribbon tied round her hair . She said I was to come back and have the doctor see to my hand in a day or two . I did come back and the doctor said she 'd done a good job of dressing my hand , Ellen had , and they asked me to supper . " They had candles on the table , with pendants hanging down round them , and such china as I 'd never seen , and a girl to wait on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I was to come one night a week and read there in their library and could take books home . I never was much of a person for reading , but I used to go . The doctor 's wife would play the piano and Ellen would sing . " " And did you sing ? " Grandma asked . " No , I 'd no voice , but I liked to hear Ellen sing . Sometimes I played checkers with the doctor . " " And then you went away and told Ellen you 'd be back for her when you 'd got started and could afford to marry ? " " Well , I went away all right , but I 'd never have dared say anything like that to Ellen then . 1 did come to tell her good-by though , and she sang for me . I was nineteen then and she , two years younger than me , seventeen . The doctor 's wife said if they had known I was going away they would have had me up for supper that last evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night and sang ' Robin Adair . ' You know that song ? " " 1 should say I do , " said Grandma , and beating time with a forefinger , sang in a quavering treble : " ' What 's this dull town to me , Robin 's not here ! ' " " Yes , that 's the way it goes ! " Mr. Ilaverfield exclaimed , " and when they do get these new music machines to working really good  --  you 've seen them , have n't you , with the music in a little cylinder and you slip it over a small bar and wind the machine and the music comes out of a horn ? ? well , when they get them really good I 'm going to have one , and that 's the first piece I 'll buy . I 'm a sentimental man I guess . Well , she sang that song . She had on a black velvet dress  --  it was in the fall , just about this time of the year  --  and a wide white collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; had braid twisted round and round in patterns , with threads running in between , something like a horse 's fly net , that collar , if you know what I mean . " " Yes , of course , " Grandma said , " Eattenbergl They were all the style then and very pretty . " " Well , I would n't have known the name of it , but I remember the look of it . She was a pretty girl , Ellen . " " I know she must 've been , " Grandma said . " You should have got your courage up and asked her to wait for you . " " The nearest I came to it was to say , on account of that poem we 'd learned together , ' Good-by , Fair Ellen , ' and she said Good-by , Lochinvar . ' " He looked again through the window , shook his head , and smiled . " She was almost as shy as I was . I think she saw how I felt though , for she did something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . White stairs and red carpet and a lamp on the newel post . said good-by and she ? " " She up and kissed you , I warrant , " Grandma helped . " Well , not exactly , but she started to . I think that 's what she started to do ; she put her hands up on my shoulders and then she turned and ran back into the living room where the doctor and his wife were . Last I ever saw of her . " " You got started in Cleveland and by and by you met somebody and got mar-ried . " " Right , " he said , " and a good wife Dora was to me . A better mother never lived . She was my boss 's daughter there . We were n't always of one mind , but we got on . She looked after the house and the children and I looked after the plant . I 've got girls of my own , two , both married , with families . And Dora 's been gone six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it 's a business trip too . I 'm going out to visit one of my tanneries , out past New Orchards a good hundred miles , and then I 'm going on out West and start on my trip . I 've worked hard . Except for the last World 's Fair I 've not had a vacation in my life , not one , and the girls , my daughters , talked me into this : I 'm going round the world . I 'm going first to Japan , country I 've always wanted to see . Yes , I 've wanted to go to Japan from the time I was a boy . The doctor had some Japanese pictures in his office , mountains and little houses and bridges and , I do n't know how it happened that they impressed me so , but they did . I made up my mind then that if the time ever came I could afford to travel , Japan was one of the first places I wanted to visit . " " And you 're stopping by at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grandma surmised . " Well , things sometimes come out that way , and I 'm mighty happy for you . " " Oh , no , " he said . " No , I 'm not planning anything like that . I 'm not stopping at New Orchards . " " Oh , " Grandma said , " well , I suppose a lovely girl like that would have married young and had a family . Do you know her married name ? I think it would be nice , if you know about the children and their ages , if you 'd send each of the girls something nice from over there , something Japanese . I went to a lecture , a missionary 's lecture once , and she had things along , a whole chest full . There was no end of things to please a girl ; fans and sashes and pictures and the like . I remember one thing she had was a little red cupboard , no bigger than that , with white blossoms painted on it . Open up the two doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was for trinkets and the lowest drawer was big enough for handkerchiefs  --  a thing a girl would love . I do n't think her husband would take it amiss if you sent one like that to Ellen herself with a note speaking of old times . She 's likely told him about you . " Mr. Haverfield had raised his hand a number of times to halt Grandma in her description of things Japanese that would please a woman . " No , " he said , " no , madam , that is n't the way it is . Ellen has n't married ; she lives there alone . " " She does ? " Grandma cried . " Well , then is she poorly or . . . or what . . . ? " " She 's all right , " he said . " She 's turned the wing that was the doctor 's office into a library and New Orchards children come there . I guess she put about all they left her into the place . That 's like her , to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read . " My salesman that goes out this way twice a year , I had make inquiries about her . Told him not to do anything about it , but just make inquiries about her , a number of years ago . I supposed too she 'd be married and in a home of her own . Found out she still lived there in the doctor 's house and kept that library . He went right up there , talked with her . I 'd asked him not to mention me and so he did n't and he said she was a mighty fine-looking woman  --  slim and quiet , with wavy hair , almost white , he said . Seems strange to think of Ellen with anything GRANDMA AND THE SENTIMENTAL TRAVELER 243 but that long , shining black hair . It 's good to think of her though still in that house and doing a good , kind thing like that , seeing to it the children of the town have a place to come evenings and read , is n't it ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty tired of it sometimes . You know children are near as much care as they are comfort ; and they 're not hers . I expect they mark in the books and misuse them some and scuff the woodwork . I think she must get pretty lonesome in that old house , sitting there at a desk looking at Japanese pictures that are just pictures . " The man frowned . " No , I 'm sure she 's very happy , " he said . " You see , Ellen 's always lived there and does n't know anything else ; and she 's naturally kind and good and helpful . No , I 'm sure she likes what she 's doing . I 'm sure ? " " But are n't you going to stop off and see her ? " Grandma queried . " Why do n't you ? " The man fidgeted a little and took out his large gold watch and looked at it before he said , " Madam , the past is the past . There 's nothing more precious in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have of her is  --  well , it 's beautiful , madam . It 's a treasure . I 'm a sentimental man , but at the same time , I 'm a business man ; I guess you might say I 'm a hard-headed business man . From working in a harness shop I climbed my way up until I was a partner and then until I was an owner , and I built my new factory myself and did n't have to borrow money to do it . I earned my way , I worked ; I worked like everything , Mrs. Davidson . " " Yes , I 'd know that , " Grandma said , " even if you had n't told me . I can see you 're a hard-working man . " " Then you should see what I 'm driving at , " he replied . " You ca n't touch a memory like that . You 've got to leave it like it is if you want to keep it . Nearly thirty years ! I could n't stand it to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be right for me to . Take thatcollar ; even things do n't keep . I can see Ellen in that collar standing there by the piano . I 've had my life and Ellen 's had hers and we 've each got our memories . I like to think she remembers me . " " She likely does , " Grandma said . " Women remember such things the same as men . Maybe she 's remembered it too much , since she has n't married . Maybe she expected , a long time , for you to come back for her . " " Oh , no , " he said . " We did n't speak of anything like that . I 'll tell you why she has n't married ; I thought that out . It 's that New Orchards is just a little place and not many people in it and the doctor 's house was kind of apart and they kind of apart because the doctor 's wife was such a lady and there was n't anybody there for Ellen to marry , anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Grandma agreed , " but I do n't like her sitting in that library looking at pictures when she might be packing to go to Japan . " Here 's the place we stop for lunch , this place we 're coming in to . They stop here about half an hour , if I remember right , and I think the next station on is New Orchards . " " Yes , that 's right , " the man said . " Are you getting off ? Will you have lunch with me ? " " I 've got my lunch along in this basket , " Grandma said , touching the basket with her toe . " I was just going to ask you if I could share it with you ? " " Thank you , " he said , " I think I 'll walk about a little and eat at the hotel . I have to send some telegrams anyway . Pretty hard to turn over a business to a son-in-law and remember to tell him everything before you leave the plant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I think I 'll get off and walk about a little myself after I 've had my lunch . I remember this town well from other trips . How nice a day it isl October is my favorite month , I think , if I 've got a favorite . Two of my children have birthdays in it . " " Yes , " Mr. Haverfield said , raising the derby and bowing to Grandma before he left her , " and I like coming back to this part of the country in the fall , for it was in the fall I left it . " When Grandma came hurrying round the depot the train bell was already ringing and the harness man was standing by the steps looking anxiously one way and the other for her . " Here she is , " he said to the conductor , who was standing by the steps too . " Mrs. Davidson , we were worried about you . We 're holding the train for you , " the conductor said . " You 're mighty kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I guess I walked too far . I 'm all out of breath . " In their places again , Grandma asked the harness man if he would like a piece of blueberry pie , since she had not wanted such a large piece and had eaten " just a sliver of it . " He accepted and ate it while Grandma got out her knitting and settled herself for the long ride still ahead of her . " Did you have a good lunch ? " she asked . " Oh , so-so . I felt rather restless , being here in a town I remember , after so long a time . I did n't have much appetite , but this pie is delicious . " " You 've got a drop of juice on your tie , " Grandma observed , and leaned to wipe it away with a red-and-white checked napkin from the basket . The pie eaten , the man took a timetable from his pocket and looked at it gravely . " I 'm sailing the eleventh , from San Francisco , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never been west , not as far as the coast . " " I 'm sure you 'll have a fine time , " Grandma said . " Yes , I 've counted on this trip the better part of my life , and I have n't given it up even when it looked near hopeless at times . I think I 'll do what you suggested . I think , in Japan , I 'll find something , something that would please Ellen , and send it to her , just send it with my card . " " That 's a nice idea , " Grandma said . " Just suppose , when we got into New Orchards , Ellen would be there , be down at the train . People do come down when the train comes in , in places like New Orchards . Would n't that be nice ? " The man laughed and drummed his fingers idly on the window pane . " Not Ellen , " he said . " She 'd never come down to see a train come in . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen was n't like just any small-town girl . She was the doctor 's daughter as much as if she 'd been born to them . She 's up there in that big white house , where she belongs . Yes , there 's the town . Same rolling hills , same curve to the road . Same maples . Pretty little town , is n't it ? " He crossed and uncrossed his legs , sighed , took some papers from his pocket and put them back again . " You 've been very kind , " he said , " to listen to me on this trip . I think you see how much it means to me , has meant all these years . " " And will mean , " Grandma nodded . " Slowing down now , are n't we ? Yes , here 's New Orchards . " The train was slowing , stopping . " And there 's the house , the doctor 's house , " the harness maker said , " almost hid by the trees . Fine old place , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China silk , blue-edged handkerchief and wiped his eyes . " I 'm a sentimental man , " he said again , apologetically . " And there 's a Bauenberg collar , " Grandma said calmly and without surprise . The man was on his feet . " It 's Ellen ! " he cried . " It is ! " " She 's a pretty woman still , " Grandma said , but he did not hear her . He was already moving down the aisle . Grandma called to the conductor who was going through the car . " Mr. Harris , " she asked , not stopping her knitting , " would you do something for me ? " " Of course , Mrs. Davidson . " " Set Mr. Haverfield 's bags off , will you , and take his coat . He 's stopping here . He grew up in this town . " " You do n't say ? " the conductor said , " And has got friends here , looks like . " " Yes , " Grandma said . A little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look up at her . " Did you get tired coloring ? " she asked kindly . " I saw you were making some pictures with your colors a while ago . " " I used all Mama 's paper , " the child said . Well here , I have some paper , " Grandma told him , as the train got under way . " I have paper here in my bag . You draw me a horse , will you ? " The child took the yellow piece Grandma gave him with no thanks but a half smile . " Are you sure you do n't want this ? " the mother asked , " It has writing on it . " " No , " Grandma said , " I gave it to him to color on . It 's just a telegram I made up to send when we stopped back therein that last town . I was a little anxious about the person I sent it to getting it , not having her last name or address , but I see she got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later , when she thought Grandma would not be looking , the young mother turned the paper over and read : " To Ellen . The Library . The doctor 's house on the hill . New Orchards . Would you meet the afternoon train and would you wear your Batten-berg collar ? Lochinvar . " She gave the paper back to her little boy and looked wonderingly at Grandma Davidson . Grandma was humming a hymn . She broke off suddenly and leaned toward the young mother to say , " Think of a honeymoon in japan ! And one you 'd not looked for at that ! " CREATOR OF THIS UNIVERSE BY JESSE STUART CR EATOR of this Universe , keep me Forever young and strong and give me space Among my hills as free as wind is free And snow and rain and sun to hit my face . Give me a wind to breathe slashed by the pine , Kissed by the hard-grained lips of oak and ash , And drab hills smothered by the cliff and vine , Great heaps of earth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoe , the walled-in hollow The creek of clean-blue mountain water fills ; Just guide my feet that I may safely follow The lone path of my dark eternal hills .
