To ascertain the cause of his apparent anxiety , an inquiry was undertaken at the league 's various offices , which are scattered here and there along the quiet streets and , which form the principal industry of this hamlet of 3,000 . The first inquiry was directed to the league headquarters , housed in a gray and dilapidated dwelling , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musty thing cases and whose walls are adorned with portraits of the apostles of prohibition , Pussyfoot Johnson , the Rev.
