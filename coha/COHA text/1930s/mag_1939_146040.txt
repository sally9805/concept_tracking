A picture of Franklin Roosevelt sitting at a table aboard ship in the Azores or some equally remote anchorage , settling the world 's hash personally with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini , was drawn in calm , confident words last week on the front page of the New York Times by its Washington correspondent , Arthur Krock . Some time last summer , said Mr. Krock , Mr. Roosevelt asked the Dictators to slip away and meet him at sea , but they declined . <P> Franklin Roosevelt read this latest Krock " scoop " the same morning that Adolf Hitler replied to his peace message , and he swiftly denied it. * Said he affably : " It is not true , but otherwise it is interesting and well written . " <P> Replied Arthur Krock : " It was related separately and uniformly at different times to this correspondent by men of high repute and clear minds who have the White House entree . " <P> Fellow newsmen felt confident that the Krock story was accurate in direction if not detail . Certainly it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exerting to save the peace of the world . Last week Raymond Leslie Buell , research director of the Foreign Policy Association , went so far as to give Mr. Roosevelt full credit for averting war at least twice : last month and just before Munich ( September ) . <P> Since then , Franklin Roosevelt has been engaged in an oratorical struggle with Adolf Hitler . In his last two sallies , he tried Woodrow Wilson 's tactics of talking past Germany 's leader to its people . Orator Hitler in his reply last week ( see p. 18 ) did the same , seeking to widen the split in U. S. public opinion behind the U. S. President , to bolster isolationist sentiment in the U. S. by twitting Mr. Roosevelt unmercifully for Woodrow Wilson 's failure at world intervention . <P> Herr Hitler who has his press and polls under Nazi lock &; key , made the error , so far as his U. S. audience was concerned , of caricaturing the free press of the U. S. and calling it a liar . The U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hits , seemed still to believe that Mr. Roosevelt 's search for world peace with relative justice was a search more honest than Hitler 's reply ; and that , although the U. S. may not have a perfect moral record in history , the only hope for men of good will now is in a moral future . <P> &gt;Mr . Roosevelt made a point of sleeping through Herr Hitler 's speech at 6 a. m . E. S. T. So far as he was concerned , Hitler was " stopped " for the time being and the President of the U. S. was busy at home . He had a World 's Fair to open , visiting royalty to entertain . <P> No role suits the Squire of Hyde Park better than that of well-born man-of-the-world hobnobbing with distinguished visitors . He drove down to the Poughkeepsie lumber yard where the Potomac docks when it is there , got out of his car to handshake handsome Crown Prince Olav &; Crown Princess Martha of Norway . Mr. Roosevelt , though fluent in French , speaks no Scandinavian tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegians speak Mayfair English .
