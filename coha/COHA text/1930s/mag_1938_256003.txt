Father of modern orchestration was an excitable red-headed Frenchman named Hector Berlioz , who lived in the middle 19th Century . From him such romantic composers as Franz Liszt , Richard Wagner , such impressionists as Claude Debussy , learned many a trick of the trade . Erratic but forceful , Composer Berlioz , an original in his day , was insatiably concerned with orchestral instruments . He studied them all , speculated on their possibilities , wrote a book about them , dreamed of gigantic orchestras with platoons of trumpets and battalions of violins . When he composed he often wrote for large combinations of instruments . One such work is his Requiem , which demands a tremendous orchestra and a large chorus , not to mention four brass bands distributed in the four corners of the concert hall . In the Requiem 's orchestra are 16 kettledrums played by ten players . When Composer Berlioz ' Requiem was first performed , one man in the audience fainted , and critics pronounced it the biggest noise ever heard in Paris . <P> Because it requires so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week a large audience flocked to Rochester 's Eastman Theatre and listened spellbound while an enormous aggregation of players and singers thundered it out under the baton of Conductor Herman H. Genhart . No one swooned . The performance of Composer Berlioz ' barbaric , brooding score was acclaimed as one of the most important events , and certainly the loudest , in Rochester 's musical history .
