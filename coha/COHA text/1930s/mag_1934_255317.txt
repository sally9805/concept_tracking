Man of Aran ( Gaumont-British ) . Director Robert J. Flaherty ( Moana of the South Seas , Nanook of the North ) is the cinema 's No. 1 specialist in **32;7297;TOOLONG sagas . When he heard that the Aran Islands , off the Galway coast of Ireland , were so barren that the inhabitants had to gather soil in baskets to grow potatoes in crevices of rock , he went to England 's Gainsborough Pictures Ltd. for financial backing . Man of Aran is the result of his two-year sojourn on Inishmore , largest of the three islands . Decorated with a musical score based on Irish folk songs , equipped with intermittent scraps of Gaelic , the picture proves the Aran Islands to be as inhospitable as Director Flaherty could have hoped . Like his other films , it has no professional actors , no narrative structure . It shows an Aran native ( Colman King ) , his wife , their 13-year-old son , fishing , carrying soil in baskets , catching a shark for oil , trudging along cliffs above an angry sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Motion Picture Exposition in Venice ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) , Man of Aran was exhibited to U. S. audiences for the first time last week . Critics were quick to appreciate its superb pictorial qualities , the honest artistry with which Director Flaherty photographed his characters as heroic dwarfs against the dark , enormous background of a hungry land and a mighty sea . Audiences were equally quick to feel that somehow , in the absence of dramatic line , Man of Aran missed the essence of its subject .
