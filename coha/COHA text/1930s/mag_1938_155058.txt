CZECHOSLOVAKIA <P> Last week Czecho-Slovaks , busy making the best of their abbreviated state , stopped work for a moment to take melancholy leave of General Louis Eugne Faucher , for 20 years head of France 's military mission in the former Czechoslovakia . During the recent crisis General Faucher resigned his commission in the French Army , offered his services to President Benes . Reviewing a guard of honor at the station in Prague , the General wept as he kissed the flag of the country whose army he had so largely created himself . As his train pulled out , a military band played the stately music of the Sambre et Meuse March , while Czech and Slovak officers , tears in their eyes , stood at the salute .
