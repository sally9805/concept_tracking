txt Bicycle enthusiasts will have safe paths and roadways on which to pursue their sport throughout Chicago and the country environs if a double set of plans proposed yesterday are com . pleted . One project is the proposed construction ' of 100 miles of cycle paths through the Chicago park district . Robert J. Dunham , president of the district , yesterday assured Mayor Kelly and 1,000 cycle fans that the Park board would give all possible consideration to their plea for safe bicycle paths through the park , with the possibility that funds for their construe tion may be obtained from the federal work relief program . Proposes Roadside Paths . To this possibility was added last night the suggestion of Ransom Kennicott , chief forester of the Cook county forest preserves , and Maj. George Quinlan , county superintendent of highways . Kennicott 's idea is to build , at low cost , cycle paths on the six foot dirt shoulders of the modern county concrete highways . Quinlan would help cyclists to make greater use of rural roads . Mayor Kelly , the Rt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; H. P. John Hansen , Chicago secretary of the League of American Wheelmen , and Carl Stockholm , former champion ' six day cyclist , accompanied by cycling representatives of Chicago bicycle clubs , met at the Chicago park admin. istration building to-'present torthe park board a petition containing 165.000 signatures requesting the construction of bicycle paths . Mayor Hails Cycling Sport . In presenting the petition Mayor Kelly said : " There is n't anything that soothes the nerves more than a ride on a bicycle . I 'm glad people are getting back to old fashioned thoughts and reerea tions and are forgetting the idea that money is everything . " Bishop Shell pointed out that if the young people of Chicago are to develop into creditable mature citizens they must have the opportunity of healthful , safe outdoor athletics . " Unfortunately all our boulevards are overcrowded , " said Dunham in answering the petitioners . " I wish we could double the size of every boulevard in the park district . " He said that a survey of bicycle path possibilities was being made by Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Studying European Plans . Jelinek said that he Was ' making a study of bicycle paths in European cities . " Our problem is not only that of the construction of the paths but also the assurance to parents ? that their children will ride in safety , " he pointed out . The bicycle paths under consideration by the park district , according to Jelinek , would be constructed in all major parks at . an estimated cost of $265.000 . " The proposed paths may be constructed of cinders and be 10 or 12 feet wide , " said Jelinek . Kennicott Stresses Benefits . In discussing the county 's contribution toward improving facilities ' for cyclists Mr. Kennicott declared . that adequate pathways not only would benefit the wheelmen , but would be a sound safety measure and : a relief to motorists , who find the number of cyclists on the highways increasing . " I am heartily . in favor of encouraging cycling , " said Kennicott . " It is a healthful and inexpensive sport and we should give the cyclists an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . hit ' hi modern high ' speed automobiles . ' ? " It would be inexpensive , even with cinder or gravel surfacing , to make the paths useful in wet weather . " Ma ) . Quinlan said that , while in many instances it would be possible to construct bicycle paths on the highway shoulders , he believes that there are many black top roads which might be turned over almost exclusively to cyclists . Plan Roadway Survey . " My idea , " said Mai . Quinlan , " is to have a survey made of country roads which are little traveled by motorists . These could be listed and mapped , encouraging cyclists to make use of them . The fact that cyclists are using these roads would cause motorists to avoid them , thus giving the bikes a virtual ** on them . I. Anticipating a : great  --  t.
