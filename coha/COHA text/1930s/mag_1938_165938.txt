Because some judges have abused the power to restrain unions , recent Federal legislation has treated U. S. District judges like problem children . In most labor disputes . Federal injunctions are forbidden by the Norris-LaGuardia Act . The Wagner Act routes , appeals from NLRB decisions direct to U. S. Circuit Courts , forbids lower courts to enjoin the Board , in general assumes that the less District judges have to say about labor cases the better . <P> Last week , wordy , 80-year-old District Judge Oliver Booth Dickinson of Philadelphia had much to say , thereby made an obscure labor case highly significant and , at least temporarily , regained some of his lost powers . Noting that the Wagner Act suspends Norris-LaGuardia restrictions in so far as they hamper Circuit Court enforcement of NLRB orders . Judge Dickinson deduced that District courts may intervene by injunction to protect NLRB from interference while cases are before the Board . In the case before Judge Dickinson last week , four A. F. of L. unions were interfering with NLRB . <P> They and a C. I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent employes of Union Premier Food Stores Inc . NLRB called an election to determine the workers ' preference . A. F. of L. refused to participate , picketed the stores , demanded that Judge Dickinson dismiss the company 's petition for a restraining order . Instead , Judge Dickinson found that the Wagner Act permitted him to do , in NLRB 's interest , what the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbade : order the pickets to disperse . <P> Said he : " The stores ' present predicament is wholly due to the circumstance that their employes are unorganized and looked upon as fair game for the organizers . . . . The law which stands behind NLRB in enforcing its judgments will and must stand behind it in reaching those judgments . ... No friend of labor , or at least organized labor , could think otherwise . " <P> A. F. of L. Counsel Joseph Padway thought otherwise , declared in Washington : " The Wagner Act specifically provides under Section 13 that ' nothing in this act shall be construed so as to interfere with , or impede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The American Federation of Labor will appeal this case . . . .
