" Last week they attempted to sell some choice examples of degeneracy on the international market . Up at auction in the big ballroom of the Hotel National in Lucerne , Switzerland , after having been displayed appetizingly for six weeks there and in Zurich , were 125 works by van Gogh , Gauguin , Picasso , Braque , Matisse , Modigliani , Lehmbruck , Barlach , Chagall , Hofer , Klee , Grosz and others . <P> This was not all or even mostly a brave gesture of contempt for the schools of art represented .
