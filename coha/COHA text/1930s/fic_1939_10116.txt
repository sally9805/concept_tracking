All this  --  and many more important things besides  --  had got him into a lot of confusion , a lot of torture , and a lot of brute unhappiness . And the same thing was happening to a million other young men at that time . Monk was a hard-pressed kid . And because he was hard pressed , he had wangled himself into a lot of nonsense . It would n't be true to say , for example , that he had n't got anything out of his " education . " Such as it was , he had got a great deal out of it , but , like most of the " education " of the time , it had been full of waste , foolishness , and misplaced emphasis . The plain , blunt truth of the matter was that , essentially , although he did not know it , Monk was an explorer . And so were a million other young people at that time . Well , exploring is a thrilling thing . But , even for the physical explorers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true faith , the true heroism , of an explorer . He was a lot more lonely that Columbus ever was , and for this reason he was desperately confused , groping , compromising , and unsure . It would be nice to report that he was swift and certain as a flame , always shot true to the mark , and knew what he knew . But this was n't true . He knew what he knew , but he admitted that he knew it only seldom . Then when he did , he asserted it ; like every other kid , he " went to town . " He said it , he shot it home , he made no apologies  --  he was passionate and fierce and proud , and true  --  but the next morning he would wake up feeling that he had made a fool of himself and that he had something to explain . He " knew , " for example , that freight cars were beautiful ; that a spur of rusty box cars on a siding , curving off somewhere into a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything could be , as anythinghas ever been . He knew all the depths and levels of it , all the time evocations of it  --  but he could n't say so . He had n't found the language for it . He had even been told , by implication , that it was n't so . That was where his " education " came in . It was n't really that his teachers had told him that a freight car was not beautiful . But they had told him that Keats , Shelley , the Taj Mahal , the Acropolis , WestminsterAbbey , the Louvre , the Isles of Greece , were beautiful . And they had told it to him so often and in such a way that he not only thought it true  --  which it is  --  but that these things were everything that beauty is . When the freight car occurred to him , he had to argue to himself about it , and then argue with other people about it . Then he would become ashamed of himself and shut up . Like everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poets , he was an immensely practical young man , and suddenly he would get tired of arguing , because he knew there was not anything to argue about , and then shut up . Furthermore , he had the sense that some people who said that a freight car was beautiful were fake asthetes  --  which they were . It was a time when smart people were going around saying that ragtime or jazz music were the real American rhythms , and likening them to Beethoven and Wagner ; that the comic strip was a true expression of American art ; that Charlie Chaplin was really a great tragedian and ought to play Hamlet ; that advertising was the only " real " American literature . The fellow who went around saying that advertising was the only " real " American literature might be either one of two things : a successfulwriter or an unsuccessful one . If he was a successful one  --  a writer , say , of detective stories which had had an enormous vogue and had earned the man a fortune  --  he had argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But " the times were out of joint , " and the reason he did not write great novels was because it was impossible to write great novels in such times : " the genius of America was in advertising , " and since there was no use doing anything else , the whole spirit of the times being against it , he had become a writer of successful detective stories . That was one form of it . Then there was the fellow who was not quite good enough to be good at anything . He sneered at the writer of detective stories , but he also sneered at Dreiser and O'Neill and Sinclair Lewis and Edwin Arlington Robinson . He was a poet , or a novelist , or a critic , or a member of Professor George Pierce Baker 's playwriting class at Harvard or at Yale , but nothing that he did came off ; and the reason that it did n't was because " the times were out of joint , " and " the real literature of America was in the advertising in popular magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiorelevation . Dreiser , Lewis , Robinson , O'Neill , and the advertising in the Saturday Evening Post were all the same , really  --  " Plus fa change , plus c'est la meme chose . " At that time in George Webber 's life , amidst all the nonsense , confusion , torture , and brute unhappiness that he was subject to , he was for the first time trying to articulate something immense and terriblep262in life which he had always known and felt , and for which he thought he must now find some speech , or drown . And yet it seemed that this thing which was so immense could have no speech , that it burst through the limits of all recorded languages , and that it could never be rounded , uttered , and contained in words . It was a feeling that every man on earth held in the little tenement of his flesh and spirit the whole ocean of human life and time , and that he must drown in this ocean unless , somehow , he " got it out of him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined it , plumbed it to its uttermost depths , and knew it to its smallest pockets upon the remotest shores of the everlasting earth . The greater part of his life had been lived in the confines of a little town , but he now saw plainly that he could never live long enough to tell the thousandth part of all he knew about its life and people  --  a knowledge that was not merely encyclopaedic and mountainous , but that was as congruent and single as one gigantic plant , which was alive in all its million roots and branches , and must be shown so , or not at all . It now seemed that what had been given to him was not only his father 's sturdy , solid power , but that all the million fibrous arms and branches of his Joyner blood , which had sprung from the everlasting earth , growing , thrusting , pushing , spreading out its octopalfeelers in unceasing weft and thread , were also rooted into the structure of his life ; and that this dark inheritance of blood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever and the earth again  --  this strange legacy which by its power and richness might have saved him and given him the best life anyone had ever had  --  had now burst from the limits of his control and was going to tear him to pieces , limb from limb , like maddened horses running wild . His memory , which had always been encyclopaedic , so that he could remember in their minutest details and from his earliest years of childhood all that people had said and done and all that had happened at any moment , had been so whetted , sharpened , and enlarged by his years away from home , so stimulated by his reading and by a terrible hunger that drove him through a thousand streets , staring with madman 's eyes into a million faces , listening with madman 's ears to a million words , that it had now become , instead of a mighty weapon with a blade of razored sharpness which he might use magnificentlyto his life 's advantage , a gigantic , fibrous , million-rootedp263plant of time which spread and flowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed on his entrails until he lost the power to act and lay inert in its tentacles , while all his soaring projects came to naught , and hours , days , months , and years flowed by him like a dream . The year before he had grown sick and weary in his heart of his clumsy attempts to write . He began to see that nothing he wrote had anything to do with what he had seen and felt and known , and that he might as well try to pour the ocean in a sanitary drinking cup as try to put the full and palpable integument of human life into such efforts . So now , for the first time , he tried to set down a fractional part of his vision of the earth . For some time , a vague but powerful unrest had urged him on to the attempt , and now , without knowledge or experience , but with some uneasy premonition of the terrific labor he was attempting to accomplish , he began  --  deliberately choosing a subjectthat seemed so modest and limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest ease . The subject he chose for his first effort was a boy 's vision of life over a ten-month period between his twelfth and thirteenth year , and the title was , " The End of the Golden Weather . " By this title he meant to describe that change in the color of life which every child has known  --  the change from the enchanted light and weather of his soul , the full golden light , the magic green and gold in which he sees the earth in childhood , and , far away , the fabulous vision of the golden city , blazing forever in his vision and at the end of all his dreams , in whose enchanted streets he thinks that he shall some day walk a conqueror , a proud and honored figure in a life more glorious , fortunate , and happy than any he has ever known . In this brief story he prepared to tell how , at this period in a child 's life , this strange and magic light  --  this " golden weather "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the troubling weathers of a man 's soul are revealed to him ; and how , for the first time , he becomesaware of the thousand changing visages of time ; and how his clear and radiant legend of the earth is , for the first time , touched with confusion and bewilderment , menaced by terrible depths and enigmas of experience he has never known before . He wanted to tell the story of this year exactly as he remembered it , and with all the things and people he had known that year.  | Accordingly , he began to write about it , starting the story at three o'clock in the afternoon in the yard before his uncle 's house . Jerry Alsop was changing . More than any of the others , he had plunged into the sea of life . As he said , his " sphere had widened , " and now it was ready to burst through the little clinging circle he had so carefully built up around himself . His disciples hung on for a time , then , one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were swept away . And Alsop let them go . The truth was that the constant devotionsof the old fellowship had begun to bore him . He was heard to mutter that he was getting " damned tired of having the place used as a clubhouse all the time . " There was a final scene with Monk . The younger man 's first story had been rejected , and a word that Monk had spoken had come back to Alsop and stung him . It was some bitter , youthful word , spoken with youth 's wounded vanity , about " the artist " in a " world of Philistines , " and of the artist 's " right . " The foolish word , just salve to wounded pride , with its arrogant implication of superiority , infuriatedAlsop . But , characteristically , when he saw Monk again he did not make the direct attack . Instead , he referred venomously to a book that he had been reading by one of the a'sthetic critics of the period , putting into his mouth , exaggerating and destroying , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an artist , ' " Alsop sneered . " I 'm better than these God-damned other people . Philistines ca n't understand me . ' " He laughed venomously , and then , his pale eyes narrowed into slits , he said : " Do you know what he is ? He 's just an ass ! A man who 'd talk that way is just a complete ass ! An artist ! ' " and again he laughed sneeringly , " My God ! " His eyes were really now so full of rancor and injured self-esteem that the other knew it was the end . There was no further warmth of friendship here . He , too , felt a cold fury : envenomed words rose to his lips , he wanted to sneer , to stab , to ridicule and mock as Alsop had ; a poison of cold anger sweltered in his heart , but when he got up his lips were cold and dry , he said stiffly : " Good-bye . "  |p265And  he went out from that basement room forever . Alsop said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , a feeling of bitter triumph gnawing at his heart that was its own reprisal . As the lost disciple closed the door , he heard for the last time the jeering words : " ' An artist ! ' Jesus Christ ! "  --  then the choking fury of his bellylaugh . Jim Randolph felt for the four youths who lived with him a paternal affection . He governed them , he directed them , as a father might direct the destinies of his own sons . He was always the first one up in the morning . He needed very little sleep , no matter how late he had been up the night before . Four or five hours ' sleep always seemed to be enough for him . He would bathe , shave , dress himself , put coffee on to boil , then he would come and wake the others up . He would stand in the doorway looking at them , smiling a little , with his powerful hands arched lightly on his hips . Then in a soft , vibrant , and strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up , you lazy devils . Get up , get up , it 's break o ' day . " Jim would cast his head back and laugh a little . " That 's the song my father used to sing to me every morning when I was a kid way down there in Ashley County , South Carolina . . . . All right , " he now said , matter-of-factly , and with a tone of quiet finality and command : " You boys get up . It 's almost half-past eight . Come on , get dressed now . You 've slept long enough . " They would get up then  --  all except Monty , who did not go to work till five o'clock in the afternoon ; he was employed in a midtown hotel and did n't get home until one or two o'clock in the morning . Their governor allowed him to sleep later , and , in fact , quietly but sternly enjoined them to silence in order that Monty 's rest be not disturbed . Jim himself would be out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . They ate together a great deal at the apartment . They liked the life , its community of fellowship and of comfort . It was tacitly assumed that they would gather together in the evening and formulate a programfor the night . Jim , as usual , ruled the roost . They never knewp266what his plans were . They awaited his arrival with expectancy and sharp interest . At six-thirty his key would rattle in the lock . He would come in , hang up his hat , and without preliminary say with authority : " All right , boys . Dig down in your pockets , now . Everyone 's chippingin with fifty cents . " " What for , for God 's sake ? " someone would protest . " For the best damn steak you ever sunk yo ' teeth into , " Jim would say . " I saw it in the butcher shop as I came by . We 're going to have a six-pound sirloin for supper tonight or I miss my guess . . . . Perce , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixings . Get us two loaves of bread , a pound of butter , and ten cents ' worth of grits . We 've got potatoes . . . . Monk , " he said , " you get busy and peel those potatoes , and do n't cut away two-thirds of ' em like you did last time . ... I 'm going to get the steak , " he said , " I 'll cook the steak . That nurse of mine is coming over . She said she 'll make biscuits . " And , having instantly energized the evening and dispatched them on the commission of their respective duties , he went off upon his own . They were constantly having girls in . Each of them would bring in recruits of his own discovery , and Jim , of course , knew dozens of them . God knows where he picked them up or when he found the time and opportunity to meet them , but women swarmed around him like bees around a honeycomb . He always had a new one . He brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores . It was a motley crew . They ranged all the way from trained nurses , for whom he seemed to have a decided flair , to shop girls and stenographers , waitressesin Childs restaurants , Irish girls from the remotest purlieus of Brooklyn , inclined to rowdy outcries in their drink , to chorines , both past and present , and the strip woman of a burlesque show . Monk never learned where he got this last one , but she was a remarkablespecimen . She was a voluptuous creature , a woman of such carnal and sensuous magnetism that she could arouse the fiercest intensity of amorous desire just by coming in a room . She was a dark , luscious kind of woman , probably of some Latin or Oriental extraction . She might have been a Jewess , or a mixture of several breeds . She pretended to be French , which was ridiculous . She spoke a kind of concocted patter of broken English , interspersed with such classic phrases as " Oo la la , " " Mais oui , monsieur , " " Merci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de suite . " She had learned this jargon on the burlesque stage . Monk went with Jim to see her play one time when she was appearingat a burlesque house on 125th Street . Her stage manner , her presence , the French phrases , and the broken speech were the same upon the stage as when she visited them . Like so many people in the theatre , she acted her part continually . Nevertheless , she was the best thing in the show . She used her patter skillfully , with sensual and voluptuousweavings of her hips , and the familiar carnal roughhouse of burlesque comedy . She came out and did her strip act while the audience roared its approval , and Jim swore softly under his breath , and , as the old ballad of Chevy Chase has it , " A vow to God made he "  --  a vow which , by the way , was never consummated . She was an extraordinary person , and in the end an amazingly chaste one . She liked all the boys at the apartment and enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the end the result was the same as if they 'd been members of her burlesque audience . It was the strip act , nothing more . Jim also had a nurse who used to come to see him all the time . His struggles with this girl ' were epic . There was a naked bluntness of approach and purpose in his attack . She was immensely fond of him , and , up to a certain point , immensely willing , but after that he got no further . He used to rage and fume up and down the place like a maddened tiger . He used to swear his oaths and make his vows . The others would howl with laughter at his anguish , but nothing came of it . In the end it began to be a shoddy business . All of them except Jim began to get a little tired of it , and to feel a little ashamed and soiled by this shoddy community of carnal effort . Their life together could not go on forever . All of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing in the great flood of the city 's life . The time was fast approaching when each , in his own way , would break loose for himself , detach himself from the fold , assert the independence of his own and separatelife . And when that time came , they knew that they would all be lost to Jim . It was a fault and weakness of his nature that he could not brook equality . He was too much the king , too kingly Southern , and too Southern for a king . It was the weakness of his strength , this taint of this faulty Southernness . He was so shaped in the heroic and romantic mold that he always had to be the leader . He needed satellites as a planet needs them . He had to be central and invinciblyfirst in all the life of which he was a part . He had to have the praise , the worship , and the obedience of his fellows or he was lost . And Jim was lost . The period of his fame was past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become only a memory to those for whom he once had been the embodiment of heroic action . His contemporarieshad entered life , had taken it and used it , had gone past him , had forgotten him . And Jim could not forget . He lived now in a world of bitter memory . He spoke with irony of his triumphs of the past . He spoke with resentment against those who had , he thought , deserted him . He viewed with bitter humor the exploits of the idols of the moment , the athletic heroes who were now the pampered favoritesof popular applause . He waited grimly for their disillusionment , and , waiting , unable to forget the past , he hung on pitifully to the tattered remnants of his greatness , the adoration of a group of boys . Besides themselves , he had few intimates , and certainly none with men of his own age . His fierce and wounded vanity now feared the open conflict with the world , feared association with men of his own years , with men of his own or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have to yield to anyone , play second fiddle , admit the superior wisdom or ability of another person . In the whole city 's life he had formed only one other intimate acquaintance . This was a little man named Dexter Briggs , and Dexter , appropriately enough , was a little , amiably good-natured newspaper drunk who lacked every heroic quality of character or appearance that Jim had , and who , accordingly , adored Jim to the point of idolatry for the possessionof them . As for the four youths , the fascination of apartment life in the great city was beginning to wear off . The freedom that had seemed so thrilling and so wonderful to all of them at first now had its obvious limitations . They were not so free as they had thought . They were getting tired of a freedom which always expressed itself in the monotonousrepetition of sordid entertainments , of cheap girls or easy girls , of paid women or of unpaid women , of drunk Irish girls or half-drunk Irish girls , of chorines or burlesque queens or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of its degraded lack of privacy ,  |p269its  " parties , " its Saturday-night gin-drinking and love-making , its constant efforts towards the consummation of a sterile and meaninglessseduction . The rest of them were growing tired of it . There were times when they wanted to sleep and a party would be going on . There were times when they wanted privacy and there was no privacy . There were times when they were so tired and fed up with it that they wanted to clear out . They had begun to get on one another 's nerves . They had begun to wrangle , to snap back , to be irritable , to rub one another the wrong way . The end had come . Jim felt it . And this final knowledge of defeat embittered him . He felt that all of them had turned against him , and that the last remnant of his tattered fame was gone . He turned upon them . He asserted violently and profanely that the place was his , that he was the boss , that he 'd run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it could clear out . As for his shoddy girls , he got small pleasure from them now . But he had reached the point where even such poor conquestsas these gave some bolstering of confidence to his lacerated pride . So the parties continued , the rabble rout of shabby women streamed in and out . He had gone over the edge now . There was no retreat . The end came when he announced one night that he had applied for and had received an appointment from the news agency to one of its obscure posts in South America . He was bitterly , resentfully triumphant . He was going , he said , to " get out of this damn town and tell them all to go to hell . " In another month or two he 'd be in South America , where a man could do as he blank , blank pleased , without being watched and hindered all the time . To hell with all of it anyway ! He 'd lived long enough to find out one thing for himself  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a bunch of crooked , double-crossing blank , blank , blanks , who stabbed you in the back the moment your back was turned . Well , to hell with ' em and the whole country ! They could take it and -- Bitterly he drank , and drank again . About ten o'clock Dexter Briggs came in , already half-drunk . They drank some more together . Jim was in an ugly mood . Furiously he asserted he was going to have some girls . He demanded that some girls be found . He dispatched the others to round up the girls . But even they , the whole shabby carnival of them , had turned on Jim at last . The nurse excused herself , pleading another engagement . The burlesque woman could not be reached . The Brooklyn girls could not be found . One by one the youths made all the calls , exhausted all the possibilities . One by one they straggled back to admit dejectedly their failure . Jim raged up and down , while Dexter Briggs sat in a drunken haze above Jim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following threnody : " The boys are here without the girls  --  Oh God , strike me dead ! The boys are here without the girls  --  Oh God , strike me dead ! Strike , strike , strike me dead , For the boys are here without the girls  --  So , God , strike me dead ! " Having composed this masterpiece , Dexter removed it from the machine , held it up and squinted at it owlishly , and , after a preliminarybelch or two , read it slowly and impressively , with deep earnestnessof feeling . Jim 's answer to this effort , and to the shouts of laughter of the others , was a savage curse . He snatched the offending sheet of paper out of Dexter 's hands , crumpled it up and hurled it on the floor and stamped on it , while the poet looked at him wistfully , with an expression of melancholy and slightly befuddled sorrow . Jim assailed the boys savagely . He accused them of betraying and double-crossing him . A hitter quarrel broke out all around . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . And while the battle raged , Dexter continued to sit there , weeping quietly . The result of this emotion was another poem , which he now began to tap out with one finger on the battered old typewriter , sobbinggently as he did so . This dirge ran reproachfully as follows : " Boys , boys , Be Southern gentlemen , Do not say such things to one another , For , boys , boys , You are Southern gentlemen , Southern gentlemen , all . "  |p271This  effort , which Dexter appropriately entitled " Southern GentlemenAll , " he now removed from the typewriter , and , when a lull had come in their exhausted clamor , he cleared his throat gently and read it to them with deep and melancholy feeling . " Yes , sir , " said Jim , paying no attention to Dexter . He was now standing in the middle of the floor with a gin glass in his hand , talking to himself . " Three weeks from now I 'll be on my way . And I want to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he went on dangerously . " Boys , boys , " said Dexter sadly , and hiccoughed . " When I walk out that door , " said Jim , " there 's going to be a little sprig of mistletoe hanging on my coat-tails , and you all know what you can do about it ! " " Southern gentlemen , all , " said Dexter sadly , then sorrowfully belched . " If anyone do n't like my way of doing , " Jim continued , " he knows what he can do about it ! He can pack up his stuff right now and cart his little tail right out of here ! I 'm boss here , and as long as I stay I 'm going to keep on being boss ! I 've played football all over the South ! They may not remember me now , but they knew who I was seven or eight years ago , all right ! " " Oh , for God 's sake ! " someone muttered . " That 's all over now ! We 're tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim answered bitterly : " I 've fought all over France , and I 've been in every state of the Union but one , and I 've had women in all of ' em , and if anyone thinks I 'm going to come back here now and be dictated to by a bunch of little half-baked squirts that never got out of their own state until a year ago , I 'll damn soon teach ' em they 're mistaken ! Yessir ! " He wagged his head with drunken truculence and drank again . " I 'm a better man right now  --  physically  --  " he hiccoughedslightly "  --  mentally  --  " " Boys , boys , " Dexter Briggs swam briefly out of the fog at this point and sorrowfully began , " Remember that you 're Southern  --  " "  --  and  --  and  --  morally  --  " cried Jim triumphantly. "  --  gentlemen all , " said Dexter sadly. "  --  than the whole damn lot of you put together  --  " Jim continued fiercely "  --  so be gentlemen , boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Dexter went on morbidly.  | "  --  so to hell with you ! " cried Jim . He glared around fiercely , wildly , at them , with bloodshot eyes , his great fist knotted in his anger . " The hell with all of you ! " He paused , swaying for a moment , furious , baffled , his fist knotted , not knowing what to do . " Ahhh ! " he cried suddenly , high in his throat , a passionate , choking cry , " To hell with everything ! To hell with all of it ! " and he hurled his empty gin glass at the wall , where it shivered in a thousand fragments. "  --  Southern gentlemen all , " said Dexter sadly , and collapsed into his cups . Poor Jim . Two of them left next day . Then , singly , the others went . So all were gone at last , one by one , each swept out into the mighty flood tide of the city 's life , there to prove , to test , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  alone.  | GEORGE WENT TO LIVE BY HIMSELF IN A LITrLE ROOM HE RENTED IN A house downtown near Fourteenth Street . Here he worked feverishly , furiously , day by day , week by week , and month by month , until another year went by  --  and at the end of it there was nothing clone , nothing really accomplished , nothing finished , in all that plan of writing which , begun so modestly the year before , had spread and flowered like a cancerous growth until now it had engulfed him . From his childhood he could remember all that people said or did , but as he tried to set it down his memory opened up enormous vistas and associations , going from depth to limitless depth , until the simplest incidentconjured up a buried continent of experience , and he was overwhelmedby a project of discovery and revelation that would have broken the strength and used up the lives of a regiment of men .

A furious hunger had driven him on day after day until his eye seemed to eat into the printed page like a ravenous mouth .

Even when he read Shakespeare , that ravenous eye of his kept eating with so desperate a hunger into the substance of his lives that they began to look grey , shabby , and almost common , as they had never done before . George had been assured that Shakespearewas a living universe , an ocean of thought whose shores touched every continent in the world , a fathomless cosmos which held in it the full and final measure of all human life . But now it did not seem to him that this was true . Rather , as if Shakespeare himself had recognized the hopelessness of ever putting down the millionth part of what he had seen and known about this earth , or of ever giving wholly and magnificently the full content of one moment in man 's life , it now seemed that his will had finally surrendered to a genius which he knew was so soaring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could overwhelm men with its power and magic even when its owner knew he had shirked the desperate labor of mining from his entrails the huge substanceof all life he really had within him .

It was a desperate and lonely year he lived there by himself . He had come to the city with a shout of triumph and of victory in his blood , and the belief that he would conquer it , be taller and more mighty than its greatest towers . But now he knew a loneliness unutterable . Alone , he tried to hold all the hunger and madness of the earth within the limits of a little room , and beat his fists against the walls , only to hurl his body savagely into the streets again , those terrible streets that had neither pause nor curve , nor any door that he could enter . In the blind lashings of his fury , he strove with all the sinews of his heart and spirit trying to master , to devour , and utterly to possess the great , the million-footed , the invincible and unceasing city . He almost went mad with loneliness among its million faces . His heart sank down in atomic desolation before the overwhelming vision of its immense , inhuman , and terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger ate into his flesh with a vulture 's beak as , tortured by the thousand images of glory , love , and power which the city holds forever to a starving man , he thought that he would perish  --  only a hand 's breadth off from love if he could span it , only a moment away from friendship if he knew it , only an inch , a door , a word away from all the glory of the earth , if he only knew the way . Why was he so unhappy ? The hills were beautiful as they had always been , the everlasting earth was still beneath his feet , and April would come back again . Yet he was wretched , tortured , and forlorn , filled with fury and unrest , doing the ill thing always when the good lay ready to his hand , choosing the way of misery , torment , waste , and madness , when joy , peace , certitude , and power were his , were his forever , if only he would take and use them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered the streets of noon some dozen years ago , and the solid , lonely , liquid leather shuffle of men 's feet as they came home at noon to dinner ; the welcoming shout of their children , the humid warmth and fragrance of the turnip greens , the sound of screen doors being slammed , and then the brooding hush and peace and full-fed apathy of noon again . Where were they now ? And where was all that ancient certitude and peace : the quietness of summer evenings , and people talking on their porches , the smell of the honeysuckles , roses , and the grapes that ripened in thick leaves above the porch , the dew-sweet freshness and repose of night , the sound of a street car stopping on the corner of the hill above them , and the lonely absence of departure that it left behind it when it had gone , far sounds and laughter , music , casual voices , all so near and far , so strange and so familiar , the huge million-noted ululation of the night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch ; finally the sound of voices going , people leaving , streets and houses settling into utter quietness ; and sleep , then , sleep  --  the sweet , clean mercy and repose of healthful sleep  --  had these things vanished from the earth forever ? Why was he so unhappy ? Where had it come from  --  this mad coil and fury of his life ? It was , he knew , in everyone , not only in himself , but in people everywhere . He had seen and known it in a thousand streets , a million faces : it had become the general weather of their lives . Where had it come from  --  this fury of unrest and longing , driven flight and agonized return , terrific speed and smashing movement that went nowhere ? Each day they swarmed into the brutal stupefaction of a million streets , were hurled like vermin through the foul , fetid air of roaring tunnels , and swarmed up out of the earth like rats to thrust , push , claw , sweat , curse , cringe , menace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile , little efforts that got them nowhere , brought them nothing . At night they rushed out again with the idiot and unwearied pertinacityof a race that was damned and lost , and gutted of the vigil substance of its life , to seek , with a weary , frenzied , exacerbated fury , new pleasures and sensations that , when found , filled them withp277weariness , boredom , and horror of the spirit , and that were viler and baser than the pleasures of a dog . Yet , with this weary hopelessness of hope , this frenzied longing of despair , they would swarm back into their obscene streets of night again . And for what ? For what ? To push , thrust , throng , and jostle up and down past the thousand tawdry pomps and dreary entertainments of those streets . To throng back and forth incessantly on the grimy , grey , weary pavements , filling the air with raucous jibe and jeer , and with harsh , barren laughter , from which all the blood and life of mirth and cheer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , full guffaw of the belly-laugh , had died ! For what ? For what ? To drive the huge exasperation of their weary bodies , their tortured nerves , their bewildered , overladen hearts , back to those barren , furious avenues of night again , spurred on forever by this fruitless hopelessness of hope . To embrace again the painted shell of the old delusion , hurling themselves onward towards that huge , sterile shine and glitter of the night as feverishly as if some great reward of fortune , love , or living joy was waiting for them there . And for what ? For what ? What was the reward of all this frenzied searching ? To be shone on lividly by the lights of death , to walk with jaunty swagger and a knowing wink past all the gaudy desolations of the hot-dog , fruit-drink stands , past the blazing enticements , the trickster 's finery of the eight-foot hole-in-the-wall Jew shops , and to cram their dead grey jaws in the gaudy restaurants with the lifeless husks of dead grey food . Proudly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impotent escapes , the feeble , half-hid nastiness of the moving picture shows , and then to thrust and swagger it upon the streets again . To know nothing , yet to look with knowing looks upon the faces of their fellow nighttime dead , to look at them with sneering lips and scornful faces , and with hard , dark , slimy eyes , and jeering tongues . Each night to see and be seen  --  oh , priceless triumph !  - -  displaying the rich quality of their wit , the keen humor of their fertile minds , with such gems of repartee as : " Jesus ! " " Ho-ly Ghee ! " " Oh , yeah ? " " Yeah ! " " Wich guy ? " " Dat guy ! Nah  --  not him ! Duh otheh guy ! "  | " Dat guy ? Je-sus ! Is dat duh guy yuh mean ? " " Wich guy ?

" Oh , to hurl that stony gravel of their barren tongues forever , forever , with a million million barren repetitions into the barren ears of their fellow dead men , into the livid , sterile wink of night , hating their ugly , barren lives , their guts , and the faces of their fellow dead men  --  hating , hating , always hating and unhappy ! And then , having prowled the streets again in that ancient , fruitless , and unceasing quest , having hugged the husks of desolation to the bone , to be hurled back into their cells again , as furiously as they had come ! Oh , dear friends , is that not the abundant life of glory , power , and wild , exultant joy , the great vision of the shining and enchanted city , the fortunate and happy life , and all the heroic men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his youth ? Then why was he unhappy ? Great God , was it beyond their power  --  a race that flung up ninety-story buildings in the air , and shot projectilesbearing twenty thousand men through tunnels at every moment of the day  --  to find a little door that he could enter ? Was it beyond the power of people who had done these gigantic things to make a chair where he could sit , a table where he might be fed on food and not on lifeless husks , and a room , a room of peace , repose , and certitude , where for a little moment he could pause from all the anguish , fury , and unrest of the world around him , drawing his breath calmly for a moment without agony , weariness , and damnation of the soul ! At other times his mood would change , and he would walk the swarming streets for hours at a time and find in the crowds that thronged about him nothing but delight , the promise of some gloriousp279adventure . At such a time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The great crowds stirred him with a feeling of ecstasy and anticipation . With senses unnaturally absorptive , he drank in every detail of the mighty parade , forever alert for the pretty face and seductive figure of a woman . Every woman with a well-shaped leg , or with a strong , attractive , sexual energy in her appearance , was invested at once with the glamorous robe of beauty , wisdom , and romance which he threw around her . He had a hundred unspoken meetings and adventures in a day . Each passed and was lost in the crowd , and the brevity of that meeting and departure pierced him with an intolerable sense of pain and joy , of triumph and of loss . Into each lovely mouth he put words of tendernessand understanding . A sales girl in a department store became eloquent and seductive with poignant and beautiful speech ; the vulgar , loose mouth of an Irish waitress uttered enchanted music for him when it spoke . In these adventures of his fancy , it never occurred to him that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that he was nothing but an ungainly youth , with small features , large shoulders , legs too short , a prowling , simian look about the out-thrust head , and an incredible length of flailing arms . No : instead he cut a very handsome and heroic figure in these fantasies , and dreamed of an instant marriage of noble souls , of an immediate and tremendous seduction , ennobled by a beautiful and poetic intensity of feeling . Sometimes , in these golden fantasies , it was a great lady who yieldedherself to him  --  a lady rich , twenty-four or five years of age ( for hecould not stand them younger than he was ) , and widowed recentlyfrom an old man that she did not love but had been forced to marryby some bitter constraint and hard occasion dear . The circumstanceshis meeting with her varied from repelling with a single annihilatingblow of the fist the proffered violence of some Irish thug , to findingquite by accident in the gutter , already half obscured by the deadleaves of Autumn , a wallet or a mesh-bag containing not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations , buta rope of pearls , some loose , uncut gems , an emerald of great sizeunted on a ring , and a number of stocks or bonds , together withtors of the most valuable and distressing privacy . This form of meethepreferred to any other , for , although it deprived him of hero-280 THE WEB AND THE ROCKp280ism , it enabled him to show equivalent virtues of honesty and manly dignity . Also by means of it he could pay his way . Thus , having picked up the bag on a lonely walk in Central Park , he would see at once the value of its contents  --  so huge as to make even a modest reward a substantial thing and , thrusting it quickly into his pocket , he would go at once , though by a rather circuitous route which he had all planned out , to his room , where carefully and exactly he would itemize everything upon the back of an envelope , noting that the initials upon the clasp agreed with the name upon the visiting card he should find within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once and at great speed to the indicated address . It would be a modest house in the East Sixties , or again it would be a large , grim pile on Fifth Avenue . He preferred the modest house , high storied , but with a narrow facade , not glaringly obtrusive , but almost gloomily mellow and dark . The furnishings would be masculine , the house still bearing the mark of its dead master 's character  --  walnut and mahogany , with heavy , worn leather cushions on the chairs . To the right of the entrance hall would be the library , a gloomy room in walnut , completely lined up to its high ceiling with ten or fifteen thousand books save for the interstices of recessed , narrow windows . Having arrived before the house , he would dismiss the taxicab and mount the steps . The door would be opened by a maid , a well-made girl of twenty-one or two , who obviously bathed frequently , and who wore expensive black silk stockings  --  which her mistress gave her  --  on her heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the library , pausing , before she went to inform her mistress , to poke up the glowing coals in a small grate , revealing as she bent before him , the heavy white flesh of her under leg , just above the knee , where her garters of ruffled green silk ( probably a gift from her mistress ) furrowed deeply into the smooth column of her thigh . Then she would depart , one side of her face prettily flushed by the heat , casting him a swift and provocative glance as she went , while he grew conscious of the rhythmical undulations of her heavy breasts . Presently he would hear the maid 's low voice upstairs , and the nervous , irritable voice of another woman : " Oh , who is it ? Some young man ? Tell him I ca n't see him today ! I 'm much too upset by this whole affair ! " Ablaze with fierce but righteous anger at this unhandsome returnp281for his labor and honesty , he would stride to the foot of the stairway in time to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , harsh voice , not loud but almost metallic  --  a voice of great carrying bower . " Tell your mistress that it is imperative she give me the honor of her attendance . If I am intruding here , it is certainly against my will , and at a cost of considerable anxiety , care , and labor to myself . But I have information concerning a loss she may have sustained , which I believe may be of the greatest interest to her . " He would get no further . There would be a sharp cry above , and she would come down the stairs regardless of safety , her tense face very pale , her voice almost stricken . She would seize him so fiercely with her small , strong hands that she made a white circle around his wrists , speaking in a tone that was no more than a trembling breath : " What is it ? You must tell me at once , do you hear ? Have you found it ? " Gently , soothingly , but with implacable firmness , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your property . But so serious arc the possibilities of this matter , to me , that I must ask you first of all to submit yourself to a few questions that I am going to ask you . " " Anything  --  anything you like ! " " You have suffered a loss . Describe that loss  --  the time and the place . " " I lost a silver mesh-bag two days ago between 8:2o and 8:35 in the morning , while riding in Central Park , just back of the Museum . The lag had been put in the right-hand pocket of my riding jacket ; it was dislodged during my ride . " " Describe as carefully and exactly as you can the contents of the bag . " " There were $16,400 in bank notes  --  14o hundred dollar bills , the rest in fifties and twenties . There was also a necklace with a platinum clasp , containing ninety-one pearls of graduated size , the largest about the size of a large grape ; a plain gold ring set with a diamond-shaped emerald " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump of sugar . There were , in addition , eight Bethlehem Steel stock certificates , and , what I value most of all , several letters written by friends and business associates to my late husband , which contain matter of the most private sort . " Meanwhile he would be checking the list off , envelope in hand. 282 THE WEB AND THE ROCKp282Now he would say quietly , taking the bag from his pocket and presentingit to her : " I think you will find your property intact . " Seizing the bag with a cry , she would sink quickly upon a leather divan , opening it with trembling fingers and hastily counting through the contents . He would watch her with nervous constraint , conscious of the personal risk he took , the unanswerable suspicion that might be attached to him if everything was not there . But everything would be ! Finally looking up , her voice filled with fatigue and unutterable relief , she would say : " Everything is here ! Everything ! Oh ! I feel as if I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would answer : " Then , madam , you will pardon me the more willingly if I leave you now to enjoy the first happy hours of your childhood alone . " And , taking his battered but adventurous-looking old hat from a table , he would start for the door . She would follow immediately and interrupt his passage , seizing him again by the arms in her excitement : " No , you shall not go yet . You shall not go until you tell me what your name is . What is your name ? You must tell me your name ! " Very coldly he would answer : " The name would not matter to you . I am not known yet . I am only a poor writer . " She would see , of course , from his ragged clothing  --  the same suit he was now wearing  --  that he was neither a wealthy nor fashionable person , but she would also see , from the great sense of style with which his frame carried these rags , as if indifferent or unconscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him that had no need of worldly dignities . She would say : " Then , if you are a poor writer , there is one thing I can do  --  one very small return I can make for your splendid honesty . You must accept the reward that I have offered . " " Reward ? " He would say in an astounded tone . " Is there a reward ? " " Five thousand dollars . I  --  I  --  hope  --  if you would n't mind- " she would falter , frightened by the stern frown on his forehead . " I accept , of course , " he would answer , harshly and proudly . " The service I rendered was worth it . I am not ashamed to take my wage . At any rate , it is better invested with me than it would be among ap283group of Irish policemen . Let me congratulate you on what you have done today for the future of art . " " I am so glad  --  so happy  --  that you 'll take it  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you come to dinner tonight ? I want to talk to you . " He would accept . Before he left they would have opportunity to observe each other more closely . He would see that she was rather tall for a woman  --  about five feet six or seven inches , but giving the impression of being somewhattaller . She would have a heavy weight of rather blondish hair , but perhaps with a reddish tint in it , also  --  perhaps it would be the color of very pale amber . It would be piled compactly and heavily upon her head , so as to suggest somewhat a molten or malleable weight , and it would be innumerably various with little winking lights . This weight would rest like a heavy coronal above a small , delicately-mouldedface , remarkably but not unhealthily pale , and saved from unpleasant exoticism by the rapid and boyish daring of its movements , a smile like a flick of golden light across a small , full , incredibly sensitive mouth  --  a swift , twisted smile , revealing small , milk-white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cast in an intense , slightly humorous earnestness . Her conversation would be boyishly direct and sincere , delivered half while looking seriously at the auditor , and half with the eyes turned thoughtfully away ; at the conclusion of each remark , however , the eyes , of a luminous blue-grey depth , a catlikehealth and sensuousness , would steal thievishly sideways up to the face of the listener . She would be dressed in a close-fitting blouse of knitted green silk , with pockets into which she occasionally thrust her small , brown , competenthands ( unjeweled ) . Her breasts would not be like the slow , rich melons of the maid , but eager and compact  --  each springing forwardlithely and passionately , their crisp and tender nozzles half definedagainst the silk . She would wear a short , straight skirt of blue serge ; her long , graceful legs would be covered with silk hose ; her small feet sheathed in velvet shoes clasped by old buckles . Before he left , she would tell him that he must come as often as he liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was rarely used now , and that he might have it all to himself . He would depart , the door being closed behind him by the voluptuous and softly smiling maid . Then , in a fever of excitement and rapt contemplation , he would walk , a furnace of energy , through the streets and up the broad prom- enade in the middle of Central Park . It would be a slate-colored day in late Autumn , dripping with small , cold rain , pungent with smoke , and as inchoate as Spring with unknown prophecy and indefinable hope . A few lone , wet , withered leaves would hang from bare boughs ; occasionally he would burst into a bounding run , leaping high in the air and tearing with tooth or hand at some solitary leaf . Finally , late in the afternoon , he would become conscious of delightfulphysical exhaustion , which , ministered by the golden wine of his fancy , could easily be translated into voluptuous ease , just as the flesh of certain fowl becomes more dainty when slightly old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , he would take the subway to Fourteenth Street , go home to his room , enjoy the soaking luxury of a hot bath , shave , put on clean underwear , socks , shirt , and tie ; and then wait with trembling limbs and a heart thudding with strong joy for the impending meeting . Then , at half-past eight , he would present himself at her door again . The rain would fall coldly and remotely from bare branches , and from all the eaves . The first floor of the house would be dark , but behind drawn curtains the second floor would be warm with mellow light . Again the maid would open the door for him , leading him past the dark library , up the broad , carpeted stairs , where a single dim lamp was burning at the landing . He would follow , not too close , but a step or two behind , in order to watch the pleasant rhythm of her hips and the slipping back and forth of her rather tight skirt up her comely but somewhat heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet him , the lady would he waiting . Taking him quickly by the hand with a warm , momentary pressure , and drawing him slightly towards her , she led the way into the living room , probably without saying a word , but with only the liquid stealth of the eyes . There would be none of that cold , remote , well-bred iciness of courtesy that chills and freezes up the warm glow of affection , such as " I 'm so glad you could come ! " or " It 's so nice of you to come "  --  they would have begun almost instantly with a natural and casual intimacy , full of dignity and ease and beauty . The boyishness of her morning garb and manner would have dis appeared entirely . In unadorned but costly evening dress , of heavy , pearl-colored silk , with silver hose , and black , jeweled slippers , slit would reveal an unsuspected maturity , depth of breast , and fullness of limb . Her sloping shoulders , round , firm arms , and long throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that light would be pearl-tinted , suffused , however , with a delicate bone color . The living room would be a high , spacious room , masculine in its dimensions , but touched by her delicate taste , as the library had not been , into a room which was , although not frillishly , obviously , or offensivelyso , feminine . There would be a huge divan , a chaise-longue , several large , deep chairs , luxuriously upholstered and covered with a dull , flowered pattern of old satin . A warm , bright fire of coals would be burning in a hearth of small dimensions , with a sturdy and sensible alignment of shovels , pokers , and tongs to one side , their brass very highly polished , and with no revolting antiqucy-ness of pseudo-Revolutionary bed warmers . The mantel would be an unadorned piece of creamy marble ; above , extending the entire distance to the ceiling , there would be an eighteenth-century French mirror , with a simple gilded border , somewhatmottled with small brown patches at the lower edges . The sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighteenth-century lock , very feminine and delicate . All of the furniture would have strong but delicate proportions . There would be a table behind the divan  --  a round leaf of polished walnut . Scattered about its surface would be several periodicals and magazines : a copy of The Dial , Vanity Fair , which he might pick up without comment , tossing them back carelessly with a slight ironical lifting of the eybrows , copies of The Century , Harper 's , and Scribner 's , but none of The Atlantic Monthly . There would also be copies of Punch , of Sketch , The Tatler , or sportingand dramatic magazines , filled with pictures of hunt and chase , and many small photographs showing members of the English aristocracy , gaunt , toothy men and women , standing , talking , tailored into squares and checks with the toes of their large feet turned inwards , or caught walking , with their open mouths awry , and an arm or leg cutting angularly the air , with such legends below as , " Captain McDin-$Ie and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chipping-Sodbury Shoot . " On a small table at one end of the divan there would be materials for making various kinds of cocktails and iced drinks  --  a rich , squat bottle of mellow rum , a bottle of Kentucky Bourbon whiskey matured for more than twenty years in oaken casks , and pungent gin , faintly nostalgic with orange bitters . There would be as well a cocktailp286shaker , a small bucket of cracked ice , and dishes of olives and salted almonds . After drinking a chill and heady liquor , infused with her own certainintoxication , he would have another , his senses roused to controlledecstasy , his brain leaping with a fiery and golden energy . Then they would go in to dinner . The dining room , on the same floor , would be in semi-darkness , save for the golden light that bathed a round table , covered with a snowy and capacious cover , and two small , shaded lamps upon a huge buffet , gleaming with glassware , and various bottles containing whiskey , wines , liqueurs , vermouth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid . There would be only one other servant , the cook , a middle-agedNew Hampshire woman , who had added to her native art things she had learned when the family had spent the Summer on Cape Cod , or in Paris , where the lady would have lived for several years . In the daytime there would be a man as well , who tended the furnace and did the heavier chores . This would be all the service . The estate would not be unhappily and laboriously wealthy , extending into several millions of dollars : there would only be seven or eight hundred thousand dollars , solidly founded in tax-free bonds , yielding an annual income of twenty or twenty-five thousand , the whole intention and purpose of the fortune being total expenditure of the income for simple luxury . The dishes would be few in number ; the food would be man 's food , simply and incomparably cooked . They would begin with a heavy tomato soup , the color of mahogany , or with a thick pea soup of semi-solid consistency , or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toasted bread and cheese upon it , which she had made herself . There would be no fish , but , upon a huge silver platter , a thick sirloin or porterhouse , slightly charred and printed with the grid at the edges and center . Small pats of butter previously mixed with chopped mint and a dash of cinnamon would be dissolving visibly upon its surface . She would carve the steak into tender three-inch strips , revealing the rich , juicy , but not pasty , red of its texture . Then she would help his plate to mealy fried potatoes and tender , young boiled onions , exfoliating their delicate and pungent skins evenly at the touch of a fork . She would cover them with a rich butter saute , touched with paprika . There would be as well a salad  --  a firm heart of lettuce , or an arti  --   |p287choke  , or , better still , crisp white endive . She would prepare the dressingin a deep mixing bowl , cutting small fragments of mint or onion into the vinegar , oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be deep-dish apple pie , spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon , and gummed with its own syrups along its crisped , wavy crust ; this would be served with a thick hunk of yellow American cheese . They would have also a large cup of strong , fragrant coffee , with heavy cream . He would watch the cream coil through the black surface like thick smoke , changing finally into mellow brown . He would say little duringthe course of the meal . He would eat his food decently , but with enthusiastic relish , looking up from time to time to find her eyes fastened upon him with a subtly humorous and yet tender look . Later , in the living room , they would sit before the fire , he in a deep upholstered chair , she on the chaise-longue , where they would have small cups of black coffee , a glass of green Chartreuse , or of Grand Marnier , and cigarettes . He would smoke fragrant , toasted , loose-drawingLucky Strikes ; she would smoke Melachrinos . From time to time she would move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently apart or together , would cause an audible and voluptuous friction . There would be little other sound save the enveloping and quietingdrip of rain from eaves and boughs , a brief gaseous spurt from the red coals , and the minute ticking of the little clock . From time to time he would hear the maid clearing the table in the dining room . Presently she would appear , ask if anything more was wanted , say good-night , and mount the stairs to her room on the top floor . Then they would be left alone . They would begin to talk at first , if not with constraint , at least with some difficulty . She would speak of her education  --  in a convent  --  of her life abroad , of stupid and greedy parents , now dead , of her great devotion to an aunt , a wise and kindly woman , her only friend against her family in her difficult youth , and of her marriage at twenty to a man in his late forties , good , devoted , but vacant of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she would ask him about his life , his home , his childhood , his age , and his ambition . Then he would talk , at first in short spurts and rushes . At length , language bursting like a torrent at the gates of speech , he would make a passionate avowal of what he had done , believed , felt , loved , hated , and desired , of all he wanted to do and be . Then he would light another cigarette , get up restlessly before the fire ,  | sit down again beside her on the chaise-longue , and take her hand in a natural and casual way , at which she would give a responsive squeeze to his . Then , throwing his cigarette into the grate , he would put his arms around her quite naturally and easily , and kiss her , first for about forty seconds upon the mouth , then in a circle upon the cheeks , eyes , forehead , nose , chin , and throat , about the place where the pulse was beating . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , beginning near the deep and fragrant channel that parted them . Meanwhile , she would ruffle his hair gently and stroke his face with her delicate fingers . Their passion would have them chained in a silent drunkenness ; she would submit to every action of his embrace without thought of resistance . Lying beside her now , wound in her long arms , he would pass his hand along her silken , swelling hips , down the silken seam of her calf , and gently up her thigh below her skirt , lingering for a moment upon the tender , heavy flesh of her under leg . Then he would loosen one breast over the neck of her gown , holding its tender weight and teat gently and lovingly in one hand . The nipples of her firm breasts would not be leathery , stained brown , and flaccid , like those of a woman who has borne children ; they would end briefly in a tender pink bud , as did those of the ladies in old French paintings  --  those of Boucher , for example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silken whorls and screws of blonde hair in the arm pits . He would kiss and perhaps bite her tender shoulder haunch , and smell the pungent but not unpleasantodor , already slightly moist with passion . And this odor of an erotic female would have neither the rank stench of a coarse-bodied woman , nor some impossible and inhuman bouquet , disgusting to a healthy taste . It would be delicately vulgar : the odor of a healthy woman and a fine lady , who has not only been housed , clothed , fed , and at . tended with the simple best , but has been derived from ancestral loins similarly nourished , so that now the marrow of her bones , the substance of her flesh , the quality of her blood , the perspiration of her skin , the liquor of her tongue , the moulding of her limbs  --  all the delicate j ( 'iu. ings and bindings of ligament and muscle , and the cementing jellies , the whole incorporate loveliness of her body  --  were of rarer , subtler , and more golden stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying thus , warmed by the silent , glowing coals , he would pet form on her the glorious act of love . He would dedicate to her the fullp289service of his love and energy , and find upon her mouth double oblivion . Later , reviving slowly , he would lie in her embrace , his head heavily sunk upon her neck , feel the slow , unsteady respiration of her breast , and hear , his senses somewhat drugged , the faint , incessant beating of the rain . And he would stay with her that night , and on many nights thereafter . He would come to her in the darkness , softly and quietly , although there was no need for silence , conscious that in the dark there was waiting a central energy of life and beauty ; in the darkness they would listen to the million skipping feet of rain . Shortly after this night , he would come and live with her in the house . This would be all right because he would insist on paying for his board . He would pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This is all I can afford  --  this is what I would pay elsewhere . I could not cat and drink and sleep as I do here , but I could live . Therefore , take it ! " his days would be spent in the library . There he would do stupendousquantities of reading , going voraciously and completely through those things he desired most to know , but effecting combinations , melanges , woven fabrics of many other books , keeping a piled circle about him and tearing chunks hungrily from several at random .

Then , in his spare moments between writing novels , he would show how Leonardo regarded painting only as a means of support for his investigationinto all movement , all life , and was only incidentally an artist and an engineer , and how what he was really doing was tracing with a giant 's brush the map of the universe , showing the possibility of Man becoming God .

And at night again , he would dine with rich hunger and thirst , and , through the hours of darkness , lie in the restorative arms of his beautiful mistress . And sometimes at night when the snow came snufflingin its soft fall all of the noises of the earth and isolating them from all its people , they would stand in darkness , only a dying flicker of coal fire behind them , watching the transforming drift and flurry of white snow outside .

He would own no property save a small lodge with thirty acres of woodland , upon a lake in Maine or New Hampshire . He would not keep a motor  --  he would signal a taxi whenever he wanted to go anywhere . His clothing , laundry , personal attentions , and , when he was alone at the lodge , his cooking , would be cared for by a negro man , thirty-five years old , black , good-humored , loyal , and clean .

But now at last the time for that had come.  | TOWARDS SUNDOWN ON A DAY IN AUGUST 1925 , A SHIP WAS APPROACHING 1 the coast of the North American continent at her full speed of twenty knots an hour . She was the Vesuvia , a vessel of thirty thousand tons , of Italian registry , and this was her first voyage . Now ships , like young men , are amorous of fame : they want to make their mark at their first encounter ; they are shy and desperate under the cold eye of the world . And the Vesuvia was making a test run . There had been doubt that the great ship would reach port on schedule . For five days the sea had thrust and hammered at her plates , for five days the sea had uncoiled its fury , with that mounting endlessness , that increasing savagery , that says to the sick heart : " I am the sea . I have no end or limit . There is no shore , no coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish  --  there is no end to weariness , to sickness , to the sea . " Since the great ship had strode calmly from the bay of Naples at night , lit by the last lights of Europe , that with the strong glint of sparkle , of bright glimmering , winked up and down the magic coasts , the seas had mounted day by day in power and tumult , until the memory of earth grew dear and incredible , as strange as a memory of life and flesh must be to spirits . A long swell from the Gulf of Lyons took the ship as she came out below Sardinia , and she lunged down upon Gibraltar with a heavy swinging motion . There was a breathing spell of peace late in the night as , steadily , on even keel , the ship bore through the straits , and people lying in their berths felt a moment 's hope and joy . They thought : " Is it over ? Is the sea calm at last ? " But s nn there was a warning hiss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave jarred her with a solid blow , and tons of water broke across her thousand little windows . The ship steadied for a moment , tremblingand still , while the long waters foamed and coiled along her sides : then slowly she swept forward into the limitless and plangent deep , heaving steadily and majestically up and down like some proud caracoling horse . Then , for the first time , many people lying in that ship 's dark hull felt the power and the terror of the sea . The ship , spruce and limber as a runner 's sinew , gave lithely to the sea , creaked softly with oiled ease and suppleness , dipped and plunged gracefully with a long and powerful movement , rose and fell slowly in the sea 's plangent breast . Then many men lying in their berths knew the sea for the first time : in the dark , the sea was instantly revealed to them . The experience is one that can never be imagined and never forgotten . It comes but once to the sons of earth , but wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark hold , they know that they have met the sea . For it is everything that the earth is not , and in that moment men know the earth as their mother and friend ; they feel the great hull in the dark plunge down into the heaving waste , and instantly they feel the terriblepresence of miles of water below them , and the limitless , howling , mutable desert of the sea around them . The great ship , as if pressed down by some gigantic finger from the sky , plunged up and down in that living and immortal substance which gave before it , but which gave like an infinite feel of mercury , with no suggestion of defeat , giving to itself and returning to itself unmarred , without loss or change , with the terrible indifference of eternity . The great ship rose and fell upon the sinister and unrelenting swell like some frail sloop that leans into the wind . Men felt those thirty thousand tons of steel swing under them like ropes , and suddenly that great engine of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pity for her . Their terror of the ocean was touched with pride and joy  --  this ship , smelted from the enduring earth , this ship , wrought and riveted from the everlasting land , this ship , ribbed and hinged and fused and delicately balanced by the magic in the hands and heads of men , would bring them through the awful seas to safety on strange shores . They believed in that ship , then , and suddenly they loved her . They loved her delicate , bending strength , her proud undulance that was like the stride of a proud , beautiful woman . They loved the quiet song ,  |p299the  healthful music , of her motor 's thought ; among the howling and unmeted desolation of the ocean , it was there like reason on the waters . They loved her because she filled their hearts with pride and glory : she rode there on the deep an emblem of the undying valiance , the unshaken and magnificent resolution of little man , who is so great because he is so small , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so brave because he is so full of fear  --  man , that little match-flare in the darkness , man , that little , glittering candle-end of dateless time who tries to give a purpose to eternity , man , that wasting and defeated tissue who will use the last breath in his lungs , the final beating of his heart , to launch his rockets against Saturn , to flash his meanings at unmindful stars . For men are wise : they know that they are lost , they know that they are desolate and damned together ; they look out upon the tumult of unending water , and they know there is no answer , and that the sea , the sea , is its own end and answer . Then they lay paths across it , they make harbors at the end , and log their courses to them , they believe in earth and go to find it , they launch great ships , they put a purpose down upon the purposeless waste . Their greatness is a kind of folly , for with wisdom in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructions , their infinite , laborious skill , are a kind of merriment , as soldiers seize each possible moment to carouse and whore before going into battle , nor do they want to talk of death or slaughter . The brain , the old , crafty , wearing brain , that had conceived this ship , that had , out of a fathomless knowledge of ships , foreseen her lines , given balance to her hull , gauged her weights and ten thousand interwoven proportions , was the brain of an old man dying of cancer . That subtle mind that made no error in its million calculations , that shell of eaten fibre , forever cut off now from voyages , chained to a few tottering steps and a quiet room in a small German town , had yet foreseen each movement of this ship upon the water , and had seen great waves storming at her plates . That princely craft that had shaped and launched all this now sat in a chair with rugs about its knees , and drooled porridge from its flaccid mouth , wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , was pleased and happy as a baby in moments of warmth and ease , wet itself and had to be cleaned , was lost and broken , gabbling now of childhood in Silesia , again of romance with some fat , blowzy waitress of his student days at Bonn.  |p300And  yet this rotting core could lift itself out of its decaying infancy and flicker into fire and craftiness again , and make a ship ! The ship was a token of her nation 's pride , a great panther of the sea , a proud , swift cat of Italy . Her engines , it is true , were Swedish . Her plates had been forged of British steel upon the Clyde . Her superstructurewas the work of Scottish engineering . A German had designedher . Her plumbing was American . And all the rest of her  --  rich upholstery , murals , the golden chapel where Holy Mass was celebrated , the Chinese Room where one drank drinks , the Renaissance Room where one also drank drinks and smoked , the Pompeian Room where one danced , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints  --  all of this was the product of the art of many nations , but the ship unquestionably was Italian . She was a mighty ship . Each day the master and the crew and all the passengers measured up the record of her deeds . They exulted in her speed . They boasted of her endurance . They watched her proud undulanceand her balanced rhythm in the waters . She was their darling and their joy , and they loved her . The officers walked along her decks talking in low , excited voices . Sometimes one could see them alone together , gesticulating , debating passionately , pausing in silence to observe the ship again , then continuing with more vehemence and pride than before . And the ship plunged forward through the storm , trembling like a cat . They watched her swing and dip into the mountainous waters . They saw the smoky mother of the waves boil up across her bows and whip along the decks in sheets of spray that cut like lashes : they felt the ship pause under them , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with proud and dripping head . Then a thousand tons of water smote against her plates , she shuddered like a boxer who has had a body blow , then steadied once again and plunged ahead into the mountainouswelter of sea and sky that besieged her like a howling beast . There was no distance and no horizon ; there was only this howling welter of sea and sky in which that ship was struggling like an alien presence  --  in a hell of waters that smoked and boiled , and sent her into deep valleys and rushed down upon her terribly from great heights , that poised her on the Alpine peaks of waves , then fell away below her with the speed of an express train , as if the bottom had fallen fromp301the universe and the sea was plunging down through space . The water was thick and green , and hissing with sheets of foam ; and farther off it was grey-black and cold and vicious , and the tops of waves exploded into windy white . The clouds were thick and grey and joined the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed day , and the storm mounted in violence and fury , and the great ship lengthened to its stride , meeting its first test grandly and surpassing itself , the suppressed and nervous manner of the officers was supplanted by an air of open jubilation . There were great sudden bursts of laughter among them . They began to look at the stormy sea with insolence and indifference . When questioned about the weather by the passengers , they affected a tone of cool unconcern : Oh yes , it was n't bad ; there was a bit of a storm on , but they only wished there was some really savage weather so that the ship could show what she could do . And this ship was the latest of them all upon the timeless seas . She set a day , and fixed a mark on history . She was the child of all other ships that had made their dots of time and that had brought small , vivid men and all their history upon the water  --  the Greeks , and the Phoenician traders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot Spaniards , the powdered Frenchmen with their wigs , and the bluff English , moving in to close and board and conquer . These men were lords and captains on the sea , and they had given mortal tongue , and meters of mortal time , to timelessness . Yes ! they made strong clocks strike sweetly out upon the ocean ; they took the timeless , yearlesssea and put the measure of their years upon it ; they said , " In suchand-sucha year we made this sea our own and took her for our ship and country . " This was the ship , and she was time and life there on the ocean . If from sea-caves cold the ageless monsters of the deep had risen , the polyped squirm and women with no loins and seaweed hair , they unild have read her time and destiny . She cared for none of this , for she was healthy with the life of man , and men care little for the seacavecold . In their few million years what do they know of the vast swarming kingdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratchings on it ? The storm had reached the peak of its fury on the fifth day out , and then subsided quickly . Next morning the sun shone full and hot , and the great ship had settled down to a gentle rocking motion . A little before noon that day , the third-class smoking room was crowded with a noisy throng of card players , on-lookers , talkers , and pre-luncheon drinkers . At one of the tables in a corner a young man was reading a letter . What he read apparently did not please him , for he scowled morosely , stopped abruptly , and impatiently thrust the letter back into his pocket . And yet , that battered document seemed to have a gloomy fascination for him , too , for presently he took it out again , opened it , and again began to read , this time more intently , with a kind of concentrated bitterness which indicated that his former mood was now tempered by a spirit of truculent denial . And this display of hostilefeeling would have seemed doubly curious to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader 's ire was an apparently innocent remark about the color of the sod . The letter had been written by his uncle . And the sentence that the young man could not quite get over , that stuck there in his craw like a distressful fish bone every time he came to it , ran as follows : " You 've been over there a year , and by this time you must have found out that the wherewithall do n't grow on bushes . So if you 've seen enough of it , my advice to you would be to come on back home where the grass is green . " " Where the grass is green . " This pastoral phrase , with all its implications , was the thing that rankled and hurt . The youth 's face darkened with a look of bitter irony as he reflected that his uncle had imputed to the grass  --  to the American grass  --  the very quality in which , by comparison with its European equivalent , it was most lacking . His uncle 's phrase , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphorical . And the metaphor was not wholly pastoral . For , in America  --  and again , his mind was touched with irony  --  even the greenness of the grass was reckoned in terms of its commercial value . And that was what had hurt . That was where the hook had gone in deep . So he sat there scowling at the letter  --  a young man driving through the grassless main at twenty knots an hour , truculently defiant over just whose grass was green . The youth , if not the type and symbol of the period , was yet a symptomof it . He was single , twenty-four years old , American . And , if notp303like millions of others of his own age and circumstance , at least , like certain tens of thousands of them , he had gone forth to seek the continentalGolden Fleece ; and now , after a year of questing , he was coming " home " again . Therefore again , the scowl , the hard lip , and the scornfuleye . Not that , by any means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grim , so resolutely confident in their high defiance , as the young man 's outer semblance might have led one to believe . He was , to tell the truth , a sullenly lonely , frightened , and unhappy young animal . His uncle 's letter had advised him bluntly to come on " home . " Well , he was coming " home , " and the rub was there . For suddenly he realized that he had no home to come to  --  that almost every act of his life since his sixteenth year had been a negation of the home which he had had , an effort to escape from it , to get away from it , to create a new life of his own . And now he realized that it would be all the more impossible to return to it . His family , he knew , was even more bewildered by his conduct than he was . Like most American families of their class , they were accustomed to judge conduct and accomplishment only in terms of its local and accepted value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had gone to Europe . Why ? They were astounded , a little awed , and also a little resentful of it . None of his people had ever " gone to Europe . " Going to Europe  --  so now his lacerated pride gave language to their own opinion  --  was all very well for people who could afford it . Humph ! They just wished they could afford to go " flying off " to Europe for a year or so . Did he think that he  --  or they  --  were millionaires ? For " going to Europe " was , he knew , in their eyes an exclusive privilege of the monied class . And , although they would have resented any suggestion that they were " not as good " as anybody else , still , according to the moral complex in America , they also acceptedwithout question that there were some things that it was moral for a rich man to do , but immoral for a poor man . " Going to Europe " was one of these . And the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infuriated sense that he had no reasonable argument to oppose to it  --  only a rankling sense of outrage and injustice which was all the stronger because his conviction that he was somehow " right " could find no articulate reason to oppose to what were , he knew , the standardsof accepted fact  --  increased his own feeling of solemn arrogancep304and hostility , his aching sense of homesickness , which was acute , and which derived even more from the feeling that he had no home than from the feeling that he had one . Here , too , he was a familiar symptom of the period  --  a desperately homesick wanderer returning desperately to the home he did not have , a shorn Jason , still seeking and still unassuaged , returning emptyhandedwith no Golden Fleece . Reviewed with the superior knowing of a later time , it is easy to deride the folly of that pilgrimage , easy to forget the merit of the quest . For the quest was really livened with the Jason touch , blazoned with the Jason fire . For this youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been merely a voyage of easy and corrupt escape , like those with which the rich young people sought diversion and employment for their idleness . Nor had it been like those expeditions of the eighteenth century , the celebrated " Grand Tours , " with which young gentlemen of wealth rounded out their education . His pilgrimage had been a sterner and more lonely one . It had been conceived in the ecstasy of a wild and desperate hope ; it had been carried on in the spirit of a desperate adventure , a fanatical exploration that had no resource of strength or of belief except its own lonely and half-tongueless faith . Not even Columbuscould have dared the unknown with such desperate resolution or such silent hope , for he at least had had the company of wild adventurers , and the backing of imperial gamblers  --  these young men had none . Columbus , too , had had the pretext of a Northwest Passage , and he had returned with a handful of foreign earth , the roots and herbage of unknown flowers , as token that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another paradise . And these ? Poor , barren these  --  these young Columbuses of this latter time  --  so naked , lonely , so absurd  --  and with no tongue , no languageof their own to meet the jabs , the scorn , the stern reproof of their own kind , or the easy scathing of a later ridicule  --  this uncertain , famished little crew that had been so unsure even of its own purposes , so defiant in its desperate hope , that it did not even dare to utter it  --  this desperate little crew had lacked even the security of its own consent , had forborne , through pride and fear , to reveal itself even to its own small company  --  had gone forth , each by each , in his frail scallop shell of hope , to battle stormy seas alone , to reap there in the unknown world the magic of his own discovery  --  there , from the leaden vacancy of foreign skies to derive the substance of his own America  --  and ,  |p305losing  home , to find anew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet not utterly forlorn  --  here to return , still tongueless , still unfound , and still seeking  --  still seeking home . And yet not utterly forlorn . Not utterly forlorn . The shorn Jason turned into the West again . The young Columbus was sailing home again without even the clink of a golden coin in his worn pocket , and not even a hand 's breadth of the earth of his America . It was a sorry figure that he cut . And yet  --  he was not utterly forlorn . As the young man sat there at his table he was joined presently by another man who had just entered the smoking room , and who now , after speaking to the youth , took a seat across from him and signaled to a waiter . The newcomer was a man of thirty years or more . He was of somewhat stocky build , with reddish hair , and with a florid , fresh complexion which , although it gave him a healthy " outdoors " kind of look , also showed traces of alcoholic stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable costume had a kind of easy casualness that can only be achieved through long custom and through association with the most expensive tailors . He might perhaps be best described as a " sporting " type , the type of man one often sees in England , whose chief interest in life seems to be sport  --  golf , hunting , horses  --  and the consumption of large quantities of whiskey . By the same token , indefinably and yet unmistakably , this man belonged to the American branch of the family . One could almost call him " postcollegiate . " It was not that he actually seemed to be trying to be young beyond his years . As a matter of fact , his reddish hair was already growing thin on top , he had a bald spot , and more than a suggestion of a paunch about his waist , but he seemed to be cheerfully and healthily unconcerned with either . It was only that , having presumably finished his college years , he seemed never to have graduated into responsibilities of a maturer and more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , he was obviously the kind of man that collegeys are often attracted to . One might have inferred from looking atm that he was the kind of man who habitually , and perhaps unconsciously , associated with men somewhat younger than himself  --  and this inference would have been correct . Jim Plemmons was , as a matter of fact , one of those men that one can always find on the outskirts of the more fashionable universities . He was just over thirty  --  a kind of hangover from one of the recent college generations  --  and he was still getting his living and his life out of the college life and the association of college men . Usually such men have a somewhat rusty axe to grind . Their means are devious and unsure . They are kept employed by some business or other as a kind of extra-curricular bond salesman  --  their value to the business presumablylying in the " contacts " they can make : their personal agreeableness , their ability to " mix , " their acquaintanceship with students , and their familiarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grease the skids of commerce with the oil of fellowship . In this capacity they serve a varied enterprise . Some work for fashionable tailors or purveyors of men 's clothing . Some sell automobiles , some tobacco . Plemmons himself was employed by a sporting goods concern . He was skilled , as men of his type often are , in the arts of " going along " with people of superior wealth . He had , as a matter of fact , a wide and extensive acquaintanceship among the passengers in the first-class cabins , and a large part of his time since coming aboard had been spent " up there . " Monk suspected he had been there now . " Oh , here you are , " said Plemmons with an air of casual discovery as he came up and dropped into a chair . He fumbled in his pocket for his pipe and an oiled tobacco pouch , and , pausing briefly , said , " What 's yours ? " as the steward approached the table . Monk hesitated just a moment : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two , " said Plemmons briefly , and the steward departed . " I have been looking for you out on deck , " said Plemmons as he stuffed his pipe and lighted it . " Where have you been all morning ? I did n't see you . " " No . I slept until eleven . I just came up . " " You should have been with me , " the older man remarked . " I looked for you . I thought you might like to come along . " " Why ? Where have you been ? " " I went up and took a swim . " He did not say where " up " was . There was no need to . " Up " meant first-class , and for a moment the younger man felt a touch of anger at the calm assurance with which the other took possession of all the perquisites of wealth and luxury while paying only for the modest accommodations of the poor . And perhaps that moment 's anger wasp307touched with just a trace of envy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social assurance which he himself certainly did not have , and although he more than suspected that there was a good deal of shoddy in the older man 's life  --  a good deal of pretense for which he must inevitably pay at times at the cost of his self-respect  --  he found himself more than once impressed by this show of easy manners and by this assumption of monied privilege which his own pride and constraintwould prevent him from taking . Moreover , to his occasional annoyance , he found himself at times responding unconsciously to Plemmons ' casual manner  --  playing up to it , assuming himself an air of easy knowingness which he was far from feeling , and acting in a way that was false and unnatural to him . And the base of the whole thing  --  what he really resented  --  was the implied arrogance of it . Plemmons treated his entire existence among the third-class passengersas a kind of jolly slumming expedition . Not that he acted as if he thought himself in any way superior to it . On the contrary , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the " life " of the table at which both of them were seated in the dining salon . His full-blooded geniality dominated the whole group , that humble and familiar little group which included an old Jew , an Italian laboring titan , a German butcher , a little middle-class English woman married to an American  --  just an average slice of third-class humanity , the kind of people one sees everywhere , upon the streets and in the subways , plying their humble traffic across the great seas on visits home , the whole dense weft and web of plain humanity everywhere that weave the homely threads of this great earth together . All these , of course , were delighted with Plemmons . There was an air of expectancy at the table before he came : he always arrived , of course , a half-hour late , but it is likely that they would have waited for him anyway through the course of a full meal , just for the pleasure that he gave them . He representedfor them all , perhaps , the embodiment of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of life they would themselves have ked to lead if they could have afforded it , if the hard , sheer needs ofverty , family , and employment had permitted them . Already he waskind of semi-legendary figure among them  --  a type of the rich young man without a care , or , if not a rich young man , almost the same thing ,  --  fellow who went with rich young men , who spent his money like a rich young man , who was himself so much a part of that distant and enchanted world of wealth that he felt and acted " rich . "  | There was no doubt about it , he was a fine fellow , generous , genial , " democratic "  --  just like " all the rest of us "  --  and yet , as anyone could see , a gentleman . So it was no wonder that the humble , hodden little gathering at his dining table always waited for him expectantly , with a sense of pleasure and of glee  --  always looked forward happily to his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have missed him for the world : the whole table was on the grin as he approached . He radiated so much ruddy warmth , so much cheerful casualness , such care-free , pleasant , slightly bibulous good spirits . But now , in spite of all these engaging qualities  --  or perhaps because of them  --  Monk was conscious of a moment 's flare of quick resentment , a feeling that this genial " democracy " of his companion which most of these simple people found so charming , and into which , to his own chagrin , he felt himself betrayed when in the company of Plemmons , was at bottom a spurious and rather shoddy thing , and all of its aspects , really , so far from being what it pretended  --  a feeling of real fellowship and of true respect for one 's fellow man  --  no such thing at all ; but , essentially , the shabby self-indulgence of a snob . And yet , he too was conscious of a pleasant warmth in the man 's persuasive charm as Plemmons tamped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffing comfortably , said casually : " What are you doing tonight ? " " Why  --  " a little puzzled , the other considered for a moment  --  " nothing , I suppose . . . . Of course , " he grinned a little , " there 's a ship 's concert , is n't there ? I suppose I 'll go to that . Are you going ? " " Yes . " Plemmons puffed vigorously for a moment until he drew his pipe into a steady glow . " As a matter of fact , " he continued , " that 's what I came to speak to you about . Are you going to be free ? " " Yes , of course . Why ? " " Because , " said Plemmons , " I have just come down from first . And I have two friends up there . " He was silent for a moment , puffing at his pipe , and then , his ruddy face suffusing with a pleasant humor , and with a twinkle in his eye , he glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I may say so  --  two extremely beautiful and lovely ladies . I have been telling them about you , " he said , and made no further explanation , although the other wondered what the main could " tell " about him that could possibly be of any interest to two utter strangers  --  " and they would like very much to meet you . " Again he gave no explanation to this eagerly mysterious desire , but , as ifp309sensing the other 's quick , inquiring look , he went on rapidly : " I am going up there again tonight to meet them . I told them about the ship 's concert down here , and all the people , and they said they would like to come down . So if you are not doing anything , I thought you might like to come along with me . " He said all this quickly , and very casually . But now he was silent for a moment , and then , looking seriously towards the younger man , he said quietly and with a note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were you . After all , if you are trying to write , it wo n't hurt you to know people . And one of these women is a very fine and talented person herself , who takes a great interest in the theatre and knows all kinds of people in New York that you might like to know . I wish you would meet her and talk to her . What do you say ? " " Of course , " the other said , and was instantly conscious of a thrill of pleasure and excitement as , boylike , his imagination began to build glowing pictures of the two lovely strangers he was going to meet that evening . " I 'd be delighted . And it is awfully nice of you to ask me , Plemmons . " And sensing the genuine kindliness of the act , he felt a warm feeling of affection and gratefulness for the other man . " Good , " said Plemmons quickly and with an air of satisfaction . " We 'll go up after dinner . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to relieve any apprehension in the other 's mind . " I 'm not going to . So come just as you are . " As this moment the gong rang for luncheon and the noisy groups of people at the tables began to get up and leave the room . Plemmons raised his hand and signaled to the steward : " Two more , " he said . Shortly after half-past eight of the same evening the two young men made the venturesome expedition " up to first . " The crossing of the magic line proved very simple : it was achieved merely by mounting flight of steps that led to an upper deck , vaulting across a locked te , and trying a door that Plemmons knew from past experience Mild be unlocked . The door yielded instantly : the two young men stepped quickly through and , for the younger man at least , into theincts of another world. he change was instant and overwhelming . Not even Alice in herp310magical transition through the looking glass found a transformation more astounding . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . Both had been wrought out of the same basic substances of wood , of iron , of steel , of bolted metal . But the difference was dimensional . The effect upon the explorer from the other world was one of miraculous enlargement . The first thing that one felt was a sense of tremendous release  --  a sense of escape from a world that was crowded , shut-off , cluttered , and confined , into a world that opened up with an almost infinite vista of space , of width , of distance , and of freedom . They had emerged upon one of the decks of the great liner , but to the younger man it was as if they had stepped suddenlyinto a broad and endless avenue . There was a sense of almost silent but tremendously vital dynamic energy . After the fury of the storm , and the incessant jarring vibration that never ceased below , one had here the feeling of a world as solid and as motionless as a city street . There was almost no vibration here , and no perceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silence , and of secret and mysterious power was enhanced by the almost deserted appearance of the deck . Far away , ahead of them , a man and woman , both attired in evening dress , were pacing slowly , arm in arm . And the sight of these two distant , moving figures , the slow and graceful undulance , the satiny smoothness of the woman 's lovely back , gave to the whole scene a sense of wealth , of luxury , and of proportion that nothing else on earth could do . A little page , his red cheeks shining above the double rows of brass on his jacket , moved briskly along , turned in at an entranceway , and disappeared . A young officer , with his cap set at a jaunty angle on his head , walked past , but no one seemed to notice them . Plemmons led the way ; they went along the deck and turned in at a door that entered into another world of silence , a tremendous corridorof polished wood . Here the experienced guide quickly found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , and now again they stepped out upon another tremendous promenade , a promenade even more astounding in its atmosphere of space , of width , of vista , and of luxury than the one below . This promenade was glassenclosed , which added to the impression of its wealth . More people were to be seen here , pacing , the white shirt-fronts and evening black of men , the pearl-hued nakedness of women 's shoulders . And yetp311there were not many people  --  a few couples making the great promenadearound the deck , a few more stretched out in their steamer chairs . Broad windows flanked beside , and through these windows one could see the interiors of tremendous rooms  --  great lounges and salons , and cafes as large as those one would see in a great hotel , as solid-seeming also , as luxurious . Plemmons led the way quickly and confidently back along this deck in the direction of the stern , and finding here another flight of stairs , he mounted swiftly , and presentlyled the way around into a small verandah-like cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one had a clear view backward out across the broad wake of the ship . Here they seated themselves at a table and ordered a drink . In response to Plemmons ' inquiry , the steward replied that most of the passengers were still at dinner . Plemmons scrawled a note and dispatched it by a page . Presently the boy returned with a message that the ladies had not yet got up from dinner , but would join them presently . The young men sat and drank their drinks . Shortly before nine o'clock they heard steps approaching along the passageway that led to the cafe . Plemmons looked around quickly , then got up . " Oh , hello , Lily , " he said . " Where is Mrs. Jack ? " Then he made introductions . The young woman whom he had justgreeted turned and shook hands with Monk coldly , then turned again to Plemmons . She was a woman of thirty years or more , of sensationaland even formidable appearance . Perhaps not many people would havecalled her beautiful , but everybody certainly would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a woman , withbig limbs and large proportions . In fact , she just escaped massiveness , but her bigness was curiously mingled with an almost fragile delicacy . Monk noticed when he shook hands with her that her hand wasalmost as small and slender as a little girl 's , and in her manner also , which was almost repellantly sullen and aloof , he noticed something , timid , almost shrinking and afraid . She had a dark and Slavic face , and a mane of dark black hair which somehow contrived to give acloudlike , wild , and stormy look to her whole head . Her voice wasuity , and had in it also a note of protest , as if she was impatient'th nearly everything  --  with being bored by the people she met andthe things they said to her , of being weary and impatient withost everyone and everything . It was quite a mannered voice , as well , and by its accents suggested the mannerisms of a person who had lived in England and had aped their way of speech . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mannered , and half-sullen voice , they heard steps again along the passageway , this time brisker , shorter , and half running . They turned , the young woman said , " Here 's Esther now , " and another woman now came in . Monk 's first impression of her was of a woman of middle age , of small but energetic figure and with a very fresh , ruddy , and healthy face . If his own mental phrase at the moment could ever have been recaptured or defined , he would probably have described her simply as " a nice-looking woman , " and let it go at that . And this is probably the way she would have impressed most people who saw her for the first time or who passed her on the street . Her small but businesslikefigure , her brisk steps , the general impression she conveyed of a healthy and energetic vitality , and her small , rosy , and good-humored face would have given anyone who saw her a pleasant feeling , a feeling of affectionate regard and interest  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of her if they had passed her on the street , but few people would have paused to look back at her a second time . At the moment when she entered the verandah cafe , although she had been looking for them and knew that they had been waiting for her , her manner at seeing them was surprised and even a little bewildered . She stopped and then cried : " Oh , hello , Mr. Plemmons , there you are . Did I keep you waiting hah ? " This was spoken in a rapid and even excited tone . It was evident that the words required no answer , but were rather a kind of involuntaryexpletive of the excitement and surprise which were apparentlyqualities of her personality . Plemmons now made introductions . The woman turned to Monk and shook hands with a brief , firm grasp and a friendly look . Then she turned immediately to Plemmons with a brightly inquiring and hopeful smile , " Well , are you going to take us down to see the show  --  hah ? " Plemmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Banteringly , he said : " So you really think you want to see how the other half lives , do you ? "  --  and , looking at her for a moment , laughed.  |p313A|p|parently  she did not understand him at first , and said " Hah ? " again . " I say , " he said somewhat more pointedly , " do you think you can stand it down there with all us immigrants ? " Her response to this was very quick , spontaneous , and charming . She shrugged her shoulders , and raised her hands in a gesture of comical protest , at the same time saying with a droll solemnity : " Vell , vy nod ? Am I nod mine-self an immi-grunt ? " The words were not themselves very funny or witty , but her improvisationwas so quick and natural that the effect of them was irresistible . She conceived the part so instantly , and threw herself into it at once with so much earnestness , like a child absorbed in its own play-acting , and finally her own delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gale of laughter , she put her handkerchief to her mouth and shrieked faintly , as if in answer to some unspoken protest  --  " I know but it was funny , was n't it ? "  --  and then set off again in hysterical tremors  --  all this was so engaging in its whole-hearted appreciation of itself that the two young men grinned , and even the sullen and smoldering face of the tall , sensational-looking woman was lighted by an unwilling laugh and she said protestingly , " Oh , Esther , honestly , you are the most  --  " and then broke off with a helpless shrug of defeat . As for Plemmons , he too laughed , and then said concedingly , " Well , after that I think we had all better have a drink . " And , pleasantly warmed and drawn together by the woman 's quick and natural display of spontaneous humor , they all sat down at one of the tables . From that night on , Monk was never able again to see that woman as perhaps she really was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had even looked to him the first moment that he saw her . He was never able thereafter to see her as a matronly figure of middle age , a creature with a warm and jolly little face , a wholesome and indomitable energy for every day , a shrewd , able , and immensely talented creature of action , able to hold her own in a man 's world . These things he knew or found out about her later , but this picture of her , which was perhaps the one by which the world best knew her , was gone forever . She became the most beautiful woman that ever lived  --  and not in any symbolic or idealistic sense  --  but with all the blazing , literal , and mad concreteness of his imagination . She became the creature of incomparable loveliness to whom all the other women in the world must be compared , the creature with whose image he would for years walk the city 's swarming streets , looking into the faces of every woman he passed with a feeling of disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . coarse . . . meager . . . thin . . . sterile . There 's no one like her  --  no one in the whole world who can touch her ! " So did the great ship come to port at last , and there four hundred people who had been caught up in the lonely immensity of the sea for seven days left her , and were joined to the earth and men again . The familiar noises of life rang in their ears again ; the great roar of the city , and of its mighty machines , by which man has striven to forget that he is brief and lost , rose comfortingly around them . Thus they were mixed and scattered in the crowd . Their lives began their myriad weavings . Through a million dots of men and masses they were woven  --  some to their dwellings in the city , some on vast nets of rails and by great engines through the land . All went their ways and met their destinies . All were lost upon the enormous land again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what man knows ?  | AMONG THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF REASONS THAT HAD BROUGHT MONK back to America was one of the most distressing practicality . He had spent all his money , and now would have to earn his living . This problem had caused him much anxiety during his year abroad . He slid not know what he was fitted for , unless it was some kind of academic post , and he wanted , if possible , to stay in New York . So he had made application and submitted his qualifications to one of the large educational factories in the city . There had been much correspondence , and a few friends had also been active in his behalf , and , shortly before he sailed from Europe , word had come that the job was his . The School for Utility Cultures , Inc. , was downtown , and when Monk got off the boat he engaged a room at a small hotel near by that would be convenient to his work . Then , with the good feeling that he was at last established and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r. i n for Libya Hill to pay his duties to Aunt Maw and Uncle Mark in the brief interim before school opened . When he returned to New York after this short visit , the city seemed deserted . He saw no one he knew , and almost immediately the great exhilaration of return was succeeded by the old feeling of haunting homelessness , of looking for something that was not there . Everyone who has ever returned to New York after an absence must have had this feeling ; it is so overwhelming and characteristic of the city 's life that people feel it even when they have been away only for a month or two . And in a way it is this very quality that makes the life of the city so wonderful and so terrible . It is the most homeless home in all the world . It is the gigantic tenement of Here Comes Everybody . And that is what makes it so strange , so cruel , so tender , and so beautiful . One belongs to New York instantly , one belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that haunting other world ' twixt land and land , in that strange and fated cosmos of a ship . And now he was baffled and maddened by the sense that this world with all its beauty , loveliness , and impossible reality was lost to him forever , had been fracturedlike a bubble at the moment of its contact with the land ; and that now  --  with its huge cargo of longing and unrealized desire , for all its reality , now stranger , more insubstantial than a dream  --  it must live forever now uncaptured , to burn , to scar , to hackle in his heart . Well , then , he must forget it . But he could not . It kept coming back to haunt him all the time , together with that flower of a face . The upshot of it all was that he sat down one night and wrote her a letter . It was one of those pompous , foolish , vainglorious letters that young men write , that seem so fine when they write them , and that they writhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman the truth , which was that he had missed her and thought about her and wanted earnestly to see her again , he struck a very high and mighty attitude , cleared his epistolary throat , and let the periods roll . " Dear Mrs. Jack , " he began  --  he all but started it " Dear Madam "  --  " I do not know if you remember me or not "  --  although he knew she would . " It has been my experience along life 's way "  --  he liked the sound of " it has been my experience , " it had a ring of mature authorityand casual knowingness that he thought was quite impressive , but he went back and crossed out " along life 's way " as being trite and probably sentimental . " I believe you spoke of seeing me again . If by chance you should remember me , and should ever feel inclined to see me , my address is here at this hotel . " He thought this part was pretty neat : it salved his pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of graciously conferring a privilege on someone who was fairly clamoringto meet him again . " However , if you do not feel inclined , it does not matter ; after all , ours was a chance acquaintance of the voyage  --  and these things pass . . . . In a life which for the most part has been lived alone , I have learned to expect or ask for nothing . . . . Whateverelse the world may say of me , I have never truckled to the mob , nor for a moment bent the pregnant hinges of the knee to flatter the vanity of the idle rich . " It is hard to say just what this had to do with his desire to see this woman again , but he thought it had a fine , ringingnote of proud independence  --  particularly the part about not trucklingto the mob  --  so he let this stay . However , upon reexamination , the part about bending the pregnant hinges of the knee to flatterp319the vanity of the idle rich seemed to him a little too harsh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to flatter the vanity of the individual . " When he had finished this high piece of thumping rhetoric it was seventeen pages long , and as he read it over he felt a sense of vague but strong unhappiness and discontent . To inform a lady casually that he would be graciously pleased to see her again if she liked , but that if she did n't it was all one to him and did n't matter , was very well . But he felt that seventeen pages to express this casual disinterest was laying it on a bit thick . Assuredly he was not satisfied with it , for he rewrote it several times , striking out phrases here and there , condensingit , modifying some of the more truculent asperities , and trying to give the whole creation a tone of casual urbanity . The best he could finally achieve , however , was an epistle of some eleven pages , still pretty high in manner , and grimly declaratory of his resolve not to " truckle , " but of a somewhat more conciliating texture than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addressed it , started to drop it in the box  --  withdrew  --  began  --  withdrew  --  and wound up by thrusting the envelope morosely in his inner breast pocket and walking around with it a day or two , wearing it sullenly , to speak , until the document was soiled and dog-eared from much , and then , in a fit of furious self-contempt , thrusting it into ater-box one night and banging down the lid  --  after which fatal and revocable clangor , he realized he had made a fool of himself , andwondered miserably why he had concocted this gaudy and pretending unfaronade , when all that had been needed was plain speech . Whereat , his darkened mind got busily to work upon this painfulmystery  --  how he had done this thing before in letters to his family orfriends , and how a man could feel so truly and yet write so false . Itde the heart sink down to see how often in such ways he had beenIf betrayed and had no one but himself to blame . But , of such is youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORNING BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF BED . HE WOKE , rolled over drowsily , reached for the instrument , and , as consciousnessbegan to dawn , grunted with the unpleasant awareness of a man who has done something the night before which he would like to forget , and which he knows he will presently remember plainly . In another moment he sat bolt upright , taut as a wire , and listening  --  he had heard her voice upon the phone : " Hello ! . . . Oh , hello ! ... " Even in the electric thrill of recognition , he was conscious of a feeling of disappointment and regret . Over the phone her voice seemed sharper than he had remembered it . It was , he saw , a " city " voice , a little cracked , impatient , and a trifle shrill . " Oh  --  " she said less loudly , when she was sure that she had reached him . " Hello . . . . How are you ? " She seemed a little nervous now , and ill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now come back to embarrass her in this plain work-of-morning style . " I got your letter , " she went on quickly and a little awkwardly . " I was glad to hear from you . . . . Look ! " after a brief pause , she spoke abruptly , " How 'd you like to see the show tonight ? " The friendly words both reassured him and relieved him , and also gave him the vague shock of disappointment and disillusion he had felt before . He did not quite know why , but probably he had expected something more " romantic . " The rather sharp voice , the sense of awkwardnessand constraint , and the homely sound of " How 'd you like to see the show tonight ? " were not what he had expected at all . But all the same he was overjoyed to hear from her , and he stammeredout that of course he would like to see the show . " All right , then , " she said , concluding the matter rapidly , with a suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . Do youp32Iknow how to get there  --  hah ? " Before he had a chance to answer , she had gone right on with her directions , telling him what to do . " And I 'll meet you there at twenty after eight .... I 'll have a ticket for you .... I 'll meet you there in front of the theatah "  --  even in his excitement he noticed her quick , neat pronunciation of the last word . Then , after quickly repeating her instructions , and , even while he was still blundering out his thanks , she said quickly , nervously , and impatiently , as if somehow eager to conclude the matter before anything more could be said : " Well , then . . . good . . . I 'll be expectingyou . . . . Will be nice to see you again "  --  and before he could say anything else , she had hung up . That day was to be forever after printed on his memory as a day that was divided in two moments  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of what happened in between he later on would have no recollection . Presumably , he got up and dressed and went about the business of the day . He met his classes and he did his work , he wove his way among the million others of the never-ending streets  --  but all these things , these acts , these tones and lights and weathers , all these faces , were later as blank and as unmemoried as if they never had occurred . Curiously , he was later to remember with a poignant and haunting vividness the details of the ride he took that evening as he went to meet her . The theatre , one of those little theatres that had their inception as a kind of work of charity , as a sort of adjunct to " settlement work " among " the poor classes , " was supported largely by the endowments of wealthy females , and had grown quite celebrated in recent years . In the beginning , no doubt , its purposes had been largely humanitarian . That is to say , certain yearning sensitivenesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might very well have been : " They 've got to eat cake . " At the inception , there was probably a good deal of nonsense about " bringing beauty into their lives , " ennobling the swarming masses of the East Side through the ballet , " the arts of the dance , " " the theatre of ideas , " and all the rest of the pure old neurotic aestheticism that tainted the theatre of the period . As the years had passed , however , these aspirations had undergone a curious and ironic transformation . The ideals were much the same , but the personnel had changed . The most considerable portion of the audiences that now packed this little theatre nightly were , it is true , from the East Side , but the East Side had now moved uptown , and the struggling masses were derived from the fashionable apartment houses of that district . They arrived in glittering machines in which large areas of bare back and shirt front were visible , and although the masses still struggled , their struggles were now largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 've got them  --  and this is Mr. Maecenas Gotrox speaking . " Yes , the Community Guild had moved uptown , although it still did business in the same old place . It had grown fashionable , and it was thriving on its blight . It still did " finer things , " of course , but it did them with eye cocked on the boiled-shirt trade . And the boiled-shirt trade was ready  --  nay , was eager  --  to be eyed . Indeed , the fashionable success of the little theatre in the last year or two had been so great that it was now in the comfortable position to which the Lady Harlot always aspires when she is having a run of luck  --  she could pick and choose , fix her own price , and roundly sneer at all her victims even as she took their money  --  which is to say , that for all its fine pretenses , its cultural programs , its " brave experiments , " and all the rest of it , the Painted Jade was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of things the Painted Jade had come to stay . For Fashion cracked the whip , and Fashion had decreed that trips into the lower East Side were now not only in order but compulsory ; there could be no dinner talk hereafter without an excursion to the lower East . And yet a trip down to the lower East Side was always a curiously memorable and moving experience , and the young man felt this more than ever as he was driven there this evening at the appointed time . It had always seemed to him , he did not know why , the real New York  --  for all its poverty , its squalor , its swarming confinement , the essential New York ; by all odds the richest , the most exciting , the most colorful New York that he had known . And now , upon this evening , the thrilling reality and vitality of the great East Side was revealed to him as it had never been before . The taxicab wheeled swiftly along the almost deserted pavement of lower Broadway , turned east along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Second Avenue . Here , it seemed that one had entered into another world . The street was , in the phrase of the city , " a little Broadway "  --   | " the Broadway of the whole East Side . " It seemed to him that the descriptiondid not do justice to the street . If it was a Broadway , it was , he thought , a better Broadway  --  a Broadway with the warmth of life , the thronging sense of the community , a Broadway of a richer and a more secure humanity . It is just this quality that makes the lower East Side of Manhattan so wonderful , and tonight he was able to define it for the first time . Suddenly he understood that this , of all the sections of the city , was the only one where the people seemed to belong , where they were " at home . " Or , if it was not the only one , it was preeminently and dominantly the first . The great salmon-hued apartment houses of the fashionable uptown districts lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Park Avenue , the ceaseless flight of motor cars , the cheaper bourgeois gaudiness of the great facades along the Drive  --  brought a sense of desolation . They brought into the soul of man the heartless evocations of a ruthless world  --  a world of lives that had no earth in them , a world of burnished myrmidons , each with the same hard polish , the varnish of the same hard style  --  lives that had come from God knows where , and too often were trying to conceal the places where they did come from , and lives that were going God knows where  --  a rattle of dry rice along the pavement , a scamper of ( lead leaves along the barren ways , a handful of smooth gravel flung against a wall  --  oh , call it anything you like , but it was not a Place . Place ! That was the word he had needed , and now that single , simple word defined the image of his thought . The East Side was a Place  --  and that was the thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people came from , where men were born and lived and worked and sweated and died . God knows , in so many hard and different ways it was not a pleasant Place , not a lovely Place , not an easy Place in which to live . It was a Place in which there had been crime and poverty , squalor and disease , violence and filth and hate and hell and murder and oppression . It was a Place into which the rulers of the Great Land of Canaan had taken millions of the oppressed , the stricken , the suffering , and the fleeing of mankind who had been drawn hither by the hope of their own desperate need , and had here confined them , here exploited them , here betrayed them , here distilled their blood into the golden clink of profit , here compelled the creatures of their fellow flesh and blood to eat the bread of misery and to dwell in habitations that were unfit for swine.  | And the East ? Had it been beaten in this bloody moil ? Had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great East now wrecked and riddled utterly ? No  --  for suddenly he looked , and for the first time there " saw the East , " and knew the heart of the East was invincible ; and that , for some inscrutable past of irony , the masters of the East had grown barren on their stolen fat , and the East had grown stronger on the blood it bled . It was as if , somehow , every drop of blood that ever had been shed here in the East , every drop of sweat and every cry , every step of every weary way , the whole huge and intolerable compost of poverty , violence , brutal work , and human wretchedness  --  yes , and every cry that was ever shouted in the East , in the crowded streets , every burst of laughter , every smile , and every song the whole vast fellowship of need , of hardship , and of poverty that bands the stricken of the earth together with its living nerves had got into the very substance of the East , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other Place that he had seen had had . Call it an old saddle , worn by an old rider and sweat-cured by an old horse ; call it an old shoe , a battered hat , a worn chair , the hollowedroundness of an old stone step that has been worn by seven centuries of feet  --  in these things you will find some of the qualities that made the East . Each drop of sweat , each drop of blood , each song , each boy 's shout , each child 's cry , had worked its way into the lintels of the East , had got into each dark and narrow hallway , was seasoned there into the creaking of each worn step , the sagging of each spare rail , had gotten somehow , God knows how again , into the rusty angularity of those bleak architectures in the East , the facades of those grim and grimy tenements , the very texture of the stone  --  yes , even the very color of the old red brick that was so thrilling , so wonderful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart with an electric thrill , to knot and catch the throat in a sudden clutch of nameless and unknown but powerful excitement . Yes , all of this had got into the East , and because of all of this the East had got to be a Place . And because it was a Place , the East was wonderful . Second Avenue was swarming with its nocturnal life . The shops , the restaurants , and the stores were open ; the place was charged with the real vitality of night , a vitality that is not happy but that is burningwith an insatiable hope , a feeling of immediate expectancy , the overwhelming sense that the thrilling , the exciting , the wonderfulp325thing is just there within touch , and may be grasped at any moment . In this way again , the street was most American , and it occurred to the young man that the true cleavages , differences , and separations in American life are not really those of color , race , section , or class distinction , but simply those of kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an " American " street in its nocturnal excitement , its love of nighttime , the thrilling expectancy that night arouses in all of us , closely akin to the essential life of any American street  --  of a street on Saturday night in a Colorado town when the farmers , the Mexicans , the big sugar workers have come in , to life in a town in South Carolina , or in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia , when the farmers and cotton planters have come in , or in a Piedmont mill town when the mill hands throng the street and crowd the aisles of the 5-and-to-cent stores , or of a Pennsylvania Dutch town , or of any town throughout the length and breadth of the whole country where people go " downtown " on Saturday night  --  expecting " it " to happen , thronging around , milling around , waiting for  --  . nothing . Well , this was " it . " He knew it , had seen it , lived it , breathed it , felt its strange and nameless thrill , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throat , ten thousand times , in his own small town . Yes , this was " it "  --  but unmistakably itself , in its own way  --  Saturday night here every night and all the time  --  but just the same " American "  --  the real American  --  with the everlasting hope in darkness that never happens but that may arrive . Here was the American hope , the wild , nocturnal hope , the hope that has given life to all our poetry , all our prose , all our thoughts , and all our culture  --  the darkness where our hope grows , out of which the whole of what we are will be conceived . The Place was simply boiling with the heart , the hope , the life of nighttime in America ; and in this way  --  yes , even to its rusted cornices , its tenemented surfaces , its old red brick , it was American  --  " a damn sight more American , " so he phrased it , than Park Avenue . They turned the corner , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop  --  and there , beside him at the corner curb , were a battered , rusty ash can , the splintered lathings of a broken box , the crackling whippings of a fire , and , sharp playing , leaping with uneven legs , a group of tough street urchins ; and suddenly he sensed the sharpness in the air , the wild , dark hope , the sadness , and the knowl/edge that October was soon here  --  that October would come back again , would come again . It was all so quick , so thrilling , and so wonderfully complete -- fire , crackle , flame , rusty can , curb , corner , the thrilling , fitful red of flame-lit , tenemented brick , and wild and fitful fire across the urchins ' faces  --  the whole of it was there  --  and there is nothing more of it to say , except that this was never any place except America . Meanwhile , the flame-lit urchins knotted their debate : there was a dark Italian , with his raven chief , a Jew , a little tousled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip  --  the small pack faces , and the hard , small bodies , compact as a ball , and tightened in debate  --  young , tough , a little hoarse , unmusical , but righteously indignant  --  thusthe Celt : " Dere is too ! Dere is so ! Dere is a chorch deh ! " " . Ah-h , you 're wise ! " And this was all  --  the shifting of the gears , and darkness , and the tenemented street again.  | HE FOUND HER WAITING FOR HIM , AS SHE HAD SAID , IN FRONT OF THE theatre . It was a handsome little building , bathed in light , and the red brick , the thrilling , harsh facades , of the old tenements was all around . There was a throng of business  --  expensive-looking people driving up and getting out of expensive-looking cars  --  but for him she stood there nakedly , projected on the grey curb and into his memory . She had come out of the theatre and was waiting for him . She was coatless , hatless , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a place where she had been at work . She was wearing a dress of dark red silk , and on the waist and bosom it had a lot of little winking mirrors wrought into the fabric . The dress was also a little wrinkled , but somehow he liked it because it seemed to go with her . It was one of the wonderful saris which women in India wear , and which she had made into a dress . He did not know this then . She wore small velvet shoes , with plain , square buckles of old silver . Her feet were small and beautiful , like her hands , and had a look that was like the strength of an arch of a wing . Her ankles , too , were delicate and lovely , and well-shaped . Her legs , he thought , were rather ugly . They were too thin and straight , the calves were knotted up too high . Her dress , square-cut at the neck and shoulders , revealed her warm neck ; he noticed again that her neck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her face was ruddy and healthy-looking , but her eyes were somewhat worn and worried , as of a person who led a busy life , and whose face was marked by the responsibility of work . Her hair , which was lustrous , dark , and of a rather indefinite quality , was parted on the side , and he noticed a few coarse strands of grey in it . She was waiting for him with one foot tilted to one side , giving the impression of her delicate ankles and her rather thin , nervous-looking lower legs . She was slipping the ring rapidly on and off her finger with one hand ; her whole appearancewas one of waiting , of slight impatience , even of perturbation . She greeted him as she had clone that morning , in a friendly manner , and yet with a kind of nervous and uneasy haste , a businesslike matter-of-factness that showed traces of concern . " Oh , hello , " she said quickly , " I 've been looking for you . It 's nice to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's your ticket , " she had it in a small envelope . " I got them to give it to me on the aisle . ... It 's in the back of the house , but there are some vacant seats behind it , and I thought I would come out and join you later on . ... I 've been terribly busy ever since I got back .... I 'm afraid I 'll have to be backstage until the curtain goes up , but after that I can come sit with you . . . . I hope you do n't mind . " " No , of course not . You go on back to work . I 'll see you later . " She walked into the small lobby of the theatre with him . There were a number of people here . Some of them were fashionably dressed , others wore ordinary clothes but had the look , he thought , of theatre intellectuals . Most of them seemed to know one another . They were gathered together in chattering groups , and as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complete dismissing knowingness that somehow annoyed him : " Oh , no . The play is nothing , of course . But you really ought to see the sets . " In another group he heard someone else speak with this same air of assured and casual knowingness of a play then running uptown : " It 's a rather good O'Neill . I think you might be interested . " All these remarks , with their assumption of assured authority , annoyed him past a reasonable degree . It seemed to him that such talk was false and dishonest , and against the true spirit of what the theatre should try to be ; and because he had no words to answer to such cold , smart talk as this , he again felt baffled and infuriated . The remark about it 's being " a rather good O'Neill " angered him because of its implied patronage ; and although he himself had been skeptical and critical of the playwright , he now found himself rushing hotly to the man 's defense , feeling that a genuine creative talent was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bloodless and talentless nonentity , whose only ability in life was to feed , to chew , to live upon the spirit and the life of better people than himself . This stiffened him with the feeling of cold insult and out/rage , as if the attack had been made upon himself ; and he found himself in a moment drawn fiercely in conflict with the people here . This feeling of hostility was undoubtedly increased by the fact that he had approached this place and this meeting with the woman with a chip upon his shoulder . He had come here in a spirit truculently prepared , and the words and phrases he had heard flicked him rawly like a whip . They angered him because he had always thought of the theatre as a place of enchantment , a place where one might forget himself in magic . So , at any rate , it had been with him in his childhood , when " going to see the show " had been a miraculous experience . But now all of this seemed to have been lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic and the illusion of the theatre . It seemed to him that instead of going to the theatre to watch people act , they went to act themselves , to see one another and be seen , to gather together in the lobbies before the show and between the acts , exhibiting themselves and making sophisticated and knowingremarks about the play , the acting , the scenery , and the lights . The whole place seemed to prickle and to reek with the self-consciousnessof these sophisticated people . They seemed to enjoy the excitement of this unwholesome self-consciousness , to get some kind of ugly thrill and pleasure from it , but it made him writhe , gave him a feeling of naked discomfort , of being observed and criticized by unfriendly eyes and mocking tongues , of feeling sullen , sick at heart , and forlorn . Although his imagination had fashioned or exaggerated some of this , yet at the bottom of his heart he knew he was not wi ' ll. wrong . Somehow , again and again , he was made to feel that he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as this , walk forever along the cold and endless streets , and pass endless doors , none of which could ever be open to him . He saw that this group of hard and polished people , the very institution of this building , while pretending that they were for the support of such as he , were not so at all : harsh and terrible as the admission was , they were the true enemies of art and life , who would really undermine and wreck his work if he allowed them to . The little lobby was breached , and had it been a thicket of dense cactus it could not have stuck or prickled harder in his outraged head . Mrs. Jack seemed to have many friends and acquaintances among this great gathering . She introduced him to a man with a swollen , Oriental-looking face : this was Sol Levenson , the well-known stage designer . He received the young man 's greeting without a word , turning his face upon him for a moment , and then turning his attention to Mrs. Jack again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a meager , emaciated little woman with a big nose and a drawn and tormented-looking face . This was Sylvia Meyerson , the director of the theatre , a woman of great wealth , whose benefactions were largely responsible for its existence . He sat down then in his appointed seat , Mrs. Jack departed , and presently the lights were darkened , and the show began . The show was an amusing one  --  an intimate revue which had been a great success and had won a critical and popular esteem . But here again the corrosive fault of asthetic enterprises such as this was manifest . The revue , instead of drawing its life from life itself , or instead of being a pungent and weighty criticism of the events of life and of society , was really just a clever parody of Broadway , of plays which had won a fashionable success . There was , for example , a satire on the Hamlet of a famous actor . Here Mrs. Jack had done good service . She had designed a flight of high , ladderlike steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , and the comedian was forever going up and down these steps , cleverly satirizing the vanity of the tragedian himself . There was another parody on a Stravinsky concert , a parody of one of O'Neill 's plays , some topical songs , which were just fairly good , but had in them an appropriate note of smart satire on events and persons of the times  --  Coolidge , the Mayor of New York , the Queen of England  --  and a series of female impersonations . This last performerscored the triumph of the evening . He was apparently a great favorite of the audience , a pet-of-fashion , because they would begin to laugh even before he spoke a word , and his impersonations , which seemed to the youth to derive most of their effectiveness not from true mimicry but rather from a certain twist , an exaggeration , a kind of lewdness and vulgarity which the man contrived to give to all of his impersonations , provoked storms of applause . Halfway through the first part of the show Mrs. Jack came in and slipped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermission . When the people arose to file up the aisles into the lobby andp331out into the street , she tapped him on the arm and asked him if he would not like to get up too , at the same time saying brightly : " Do you like it  --  hah ? Are you having a good time ? " Meanwhile , people began to come up to her , to greet her , and to congratulate her on the work she had done for the revue . She seemed to have dozens of friends in the audience . It seemed to Monk that two-thirds of the people there knew her , and even those who did not know her knew about her . He could see people nudge each other and look towards her , and sometimes strangers would come up to her and introduce themselves and tell her how much they had enjoyed her work in the theatre . She was apparently a kind of celebrity , much more of one than he had dreamed , but it was very pleasant to see how she received the flattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpered with false modesty nor did she receive praise with an affectation of haughty indifference . Her response to everyone was warm and natural . She seemed to be delighted at her success , and when people came up to praise her she showed the eager pleasure and interest of a child . When several people would come to her at once , her manner was divided between happiness and eager curiosity . Her face would be rosy with pleasure at what someone had just said to her , at the same time she would have a slightly troubled and concernedlook because she could not hear what someone else was saying , so that she was always turning from one person to another , bending forward in her flushed excitement and eagerness not to miss a single word of it . To see her thus in the lobby , surrounded by a cluster of congratulatingpeople , was one of the pleasantest things that he had ever seen , and by far the pleasantest moment he had had since he had come into the theatre . The picture of this flushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster of fashionable and **26;5624;TOOLONG , made him think of some kind of strange and lovely flower surrounded by a swarm of buzzing bees , save that this flower seemed to draw honey to itself as well as give it off . The contrast between Mrs. Jack and all these other people was so startling that for a moment he wondered by what strange trick of chance she had been thrust among them . For a moment , she seemed almost to belong to another world , a world of simple joy , of childlike faith , of sweetness and of naturalness , of innocence and morning . In this sophisticated gathering , each person stamped in his own way with the city 's mark ,   each touched with the sickness of the nerves which seems to be a tribute that the most favorite and most gifted of the city 's children pay  --  the hard smile and the bloodless tone , the jaded and most weary eye  --  she seemed to have intruded like some accidental Alice of the noon-day world , who had wandered in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the looking glass in a whole world of  --  mirrors . And the transition seemed to delight her . It all seemed so gay , so brilliant , so exciting , and so wonderfully good and friendly . She opened to it like a flower , she beamed and beaconed to it like an enchanted child , she could n't seem to get enough of it , and her flushed face , her eager interest , her constant air of bewildered and yet delighted surprise , as if her wonder grew with every breathing step , as if she could no longer quite take all of it in , but was sure that each new moment would be even more enchanting than the last  --  it was all the happiest and most appealing contrast to this hard and polished world imaginable  --  and yet ? And yet . " And yet " would come back many times to rend , to battle , and to haunt him in the years to come . It was great Coleridge who a hundred years before had asked this haunting question  --  and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sleep and dream that he had been in heaven and on waking find within his hand a flower as a token that he really had been there  --  ay , and what then , what then ? " New times had wrought a newer and a darker image , for if a man should sleep and dream that he had been in hell and waking find within his hand a flower as a token that he really had been there  --  what then ? The contrast , seen here for the first time in these hard mirrors of the night , was at first enchanting , but in the end incredible . Had she been born but yesterday ? Had she just come from the crib with the taste of her mother 's milk fresh on her lips ? Was she indeed so overwhelmedwith rapture at this brave new world that presently she must simply clap her little hands with joy  --  and ask the pretty lady there what was that stuff she had upon her lips , and why each separate , several lash upon her lids stuck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , Grandmaw ? " Or now , the funny man in the play tonight , why had they laughed so hard when he came out in woman 's dress , and worked his hips , and rolled his painted eyes ?  --  and said  --  in such a funny tone  --  " You must come over . " There were so many things she simply had to find out about  --  and all of them sop333wonderful  --  and she did hope the lovely people would n't mind if she asked questions . No , no  --  it was unthinkable . Such dewy innocence as that did not exist  --  and if it had it would have been intolerable . No , she indeed  --  meshed in this world , and fibered to its roots , herself adeptive to the arts of it , a brilliant thread in the web of all its dense complexity  --  might be superior , but could never be a stranger , to it . This was no child of morn . This rosy innocence had not been fashioned yesterday , this impelled loveliness had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature  --  but here surrounded , here enthroned in these strange and troubling catacombs of night , it flourished here and aped the hues of morning . How could it be believed that the legend written on these faces  --  the fine etching of the soul 's decease , the sickness of the nerves , the bloodless subtlety of the polished words , the painfulcomplication of these lives , themselves so much the product of the waste , the loss , the baffled , blind confusion of the times  --  which was so plain to him , could yet be a total mystery to her who was a part of it . With a sick heart he turned away  --  baffled and tormented , as he was to be so many times , by the enigma of that flower face . She came to him presently through the crowd , still flushed with pleasure , beaming with excitement and delight , and took him with her into the strange and fascinating world backstage . This transition was accomplished simply by opening a small door . Now they were in a corridor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wings and to the stage . The corridor was filled with the performers : many of them had come out here to smoke and gossip , and the place was filled with their noisy chatter . He noticed that most of the performers were quite young . He passed a pretty girl whom he recognized as one of the young dancers in the show . She had been charming on the stage , a quick and graceful dancer and a comedienne , also , but now the illusion of the stage was shattered . She was bedaubed with make-up and paint , he noticed that her costume was somewhat soiled , and the lashes of her eyes had been so brilliantly lighted and the lids and under surfaces so heavily darkened with some purplish substance that the whole face had a drugged and hectic look , the eyes especially having the feverish bril- liance of a cocaine addict . She was surrounded by two or three young men whom he also recognized as performers . Their faces , too , were heavily rouged , which gave them the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jack as she went past , and although she referred to them later as " those kids , " there was in their appearancesomething that belied these words . Certainly , all of them were still quite young , but already they had lost a good deal of the freshness and the eager and naive belief that is a part of youth . Monk felt powerfully that they " knew " too much  --  and that in knowing too much they did not know enough : had lost a good part of the knowledge that should be a part of life before they had ever had a chance to gain it through experience , and now must live blind on one side and confirmed in error . He noticed that the girl off stage had a strong quality of sexual attraction . And this , too , potent and unmistakable now , was too wise , too shameless , and too old . The young men who had clustered around her also showed the tarnish of this corrupt experience : there was something soft and loose about their eyes , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks and lidded eyes something unnaturaland unmanly . The comedian in the show had just come up and joined them . He was wearing the costume he was going to wear in the next act . It was a woman 's dress , he wore a woman 's wig of fluffy , carroty-looking hair , and his face , seen in this light , was hideouslypainted and bedaubed . His manner off stage was just the same as it was on : as he approached his companions , he flounced his skirts and wiggled his shoulders , glared at them with his lidded eyes in a gesture of lewd refinement , and said something to them in a throaty , suggestivetone that made them all laugh . As Mrs. Jack and the young man approached , he glanced up quickly at them , then murmured something out of the corners of his mouth that made them all laugh again . Aloud , however , he raised his voice and said , " Oh , hello , " to Mrs. Jack in his suggestive parody and yet also in a friendly way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried eagerly , then turning to the other young people with her eager smiling look of slight surprise and inquiry , she said , " What are you kids up to now  --  hah ? " They greeted her affectionately . It was evident they were all veryfond of her . They all called her " Esther , " and one of the youngactors put his arm around her affectionately and called her " darling . " This familiar use of hands and bestowing of caresses filled Monkp335with a hot surge of anger and dislike , but Mrs. Jack did not seem to notice it at all , or , if she did , she accepted it naturally and almost unconsciously as part of the easy fellowship that existed backstage . In fact , now when she had entered through that door into this familiar world , there had been a subtle yet a pronounced change in her whole manner . She seemed to be just as happy and as eagerly excitedas before , but now her manner was more familiar and assured . If anything , she had dropped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably assume in more formal social relations . Her manner now was more accustomed : this whole world back here fitted her like an old shoe . She stepped right into it , and for the first time now Monk noticed a quality in her that he was to discover came from the truest and finest source of her whole character . It was evident that she had now left the world of play and entered the world of work , and that it was the world of work that meant most to her . Her conversation now with these young people was different from what it had been with the people outside . It was a matter of quiet familiarity and complete informality , and in its simplest accent one could somehow read a deep feeling of affection and understanding . This was evident every time she spoke to any of the people who kept passing along the corridor  --  " Oh , hello , Ed "  --  " Hello , Mary "  --  " Sorry , was the coat all right ?  --  Yes , it looked perfect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , calling her " darling , " " Esther , " and touching her familiarly with their hands when they passed , as the others had done , there was this same feeling of quiet affection and understanding . She introduced Monk to some of the performers . In response to his greeting , the comedian tilted his head to one side and surveyed him languourously through his lidded eyes . The others laughed and Monk 's face burned with anger and embarrassment . A moment later , when he and Mrs. Jack had gone on back into the wings , she turned to him brightly , with a smile , and said : " Well , are you enjoying it , young fellow ? Do you like to meet show people  --  hah ? " His face was still smouldering , and he muttered , " I know , but that damn fellow She looked at him startled for a moment , then she understood , and said quietly : " Oh  --  Roy . Yes , I know . " He made no reply , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've known all these people for years . Roy  --  " she was silent for a moment and then added very simply : " in many ways he is a very fine person . . . . Those other kids , " she went on smiling , after a brief pause , " I watched most of them grow up . A lot of them are just kids from the neighborhood here . We 've trained them all . " He knew that she had intended no reproof in her quiet words , but had simply been trying to tell him something that he did not understand ; and , suddenly remembering the painted faces of the young actors , he remembered also , beneath their bright , unnatural masks , something that was naked and lonely . And he was touched with pity and regret . They had reached the wings of the stage now . Here all seemed to be action , confusion , and excited haste . He could see the scene shiftersrushing across the stage , wheeling into place with amazing speed the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths , there were thumping noises . He could hear the foreman of the stage hands shouting orders in a thick Irish tone , people were scuttling back and forth , dodging each other nimbly , jumping out of the way of big flats as they shot past . It seemed to be a case of every man for himself . For a moment he felt bewildered and confused , like a countryfellow caught smack out in the middle of the four corners of a city square , not knowing where to turn , and feeling that he is about to be run down from all directions . And yet it was a thrilling scene as well . The whole thing reminded him of a circus . In spite of the apparent disorder , he noticed that things were slipping miraculously into structural form . It was a wonderfulplace . It had the beauty of all great instruments , of all great engines built for fluent use . Back here , the flim-flam and flummery of the front was all forgotten . The truth of the matter was , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It never had . He had never been able to fool himself into believing that the raised platform before him , with one side open , was really Mrs. Cartwright 's drawing room , or that the season , as the program stated , was September . In short , " realism " in the theatre had never seemed very real to him , and it got less real all the time . His was increasingly the type of imagination which gains in strength as it grows older because it is rooted to the earth . It was not that since his childhood he had grown disillusioned , nor that the aerial and enchantedvisions of his youth had been rubbed out by the world'sp337coarse thumb . It was now just that Pegasus no longer seemed to him to he as interesting an animal as Man-O ' - War  --  and a railroad roundhousewas more wonderful to him than both of them . In other words , as he grew older his efforts to escape were directed in instead of out . He no longer wanted to " get away from it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all "  --  and he felt now powerfully , as he stood there in the wings , that here again he was in contact with the incredible , the palpable , the real , the undiscovered world  --  which was as near to every man alive as a touch of his hand , the beat of his heart , and farther away from most men 's finding than the rivers of the moon . Mrs. Jack was now in the center of her universe . She was no longer smiling . Her manner , as she stood there in the wings , rapidly snappingthe old ring on and off her finger , taking in every detail of that confused but orderly activity with an experienced eye , was serious , quietly concerned . And again he noticed a rather worn look about the woman 's eyes and head that he had observed when he first saw her that evening , waiting for him on the curb . Above her , on a kind of raised platform , one of the electricians was manipulating a big spotlight that was to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent inspection of the stage she had not seemed to notice him at all , but now she looked up quickly , and said : " No . Up . " As she spoke the words , she raised her hand a little . " You want it up more . " " Like this ? " he said , and raised it . " A little more , " she said , and watched . " Yes , that 's better . " At this moment , the stage manager came up to her with an air of haste . " Mrs. Jack , " he said , " you 've got that new backdrop too small . There is that much left , " he measured quickly with his hands , " betweenit and the wings . " " Oh , no , " she said impatiently , " there 's not , either . The thing 's all right . I made the measurements myself . You 've got the wing too far out . I noticed it tonight . Try bringing it in a bit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wing in , and the scene closed up . She studied it a moment , then she and the man walked out upon the stage , stepped over a tube of insulated wiring , and turned , facing the set , in the center of the curtain . For a moment they both looked at it , she turned and said something to the man , he nodded his head curtly , but in a satisfied way , then turned away and began to give orders . Mrs. Jack came back into the wings , turned , and began to watch the stage again . The appearance of the stage from this position  --  behind the proscenium  --  waswonderful . To one side there was a complication of great ropes that extended far up into the vaulted distance overhead . Looking up , one saw suspended a series of great drops which somehowgave a sense of being so perfectly hung in balance that they could drop or rise swiftly and without a sound . On the other side there was the dynamic complication of the switchboard . A man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of footlights . Mrs. Jack watched this intently for a moment : the lights brightened , softened , suffused , changed , and mixed with a magic fluency . She said : " A little more blue , Bob  --  no , towards the center more  --  no , you 've got too much now  --  there ! " She watched them while that magic polychrome of light like a chameleon changed its qualities , and presently , " Hold it there , " she said . In a moment she turned and , smiling , touched the young man lightly on the arm and led him back into a little corridor and up a flight of stairs . Some of the performers , costumed for the new act , were clattering down the steps . All called out greetings to her as they passed , in the same casual and affectionate way he had observed before . Upstairs , there was a row of dressing rooms , and as he went by he could hear the voices of the performers , excited , busy , occasionally laughing . They mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and entered a large room that opened at the end of the corridor . The door was open and the room was lighted . This was the costume room . Compared to the sharp excitement , the air of expectation and of hurried activity which he had observed in other parts of the . theatre , the atmosphere of this room was quiet , subdued , and even , after so much electric tension , just vaguely melancholy . The room had in it the smell of goods and cloth ; it had also the kind of gentle warmth that goes with women 's work  --  with the hum of sewing machines , the sound of the treadle , and the quiet play of busy hands  --  an atmosphere that is apparently a happy one for a woman , but that is likely to be a little depressing to a man . To the youth , the room , although a large one , and on the scale of ordered enterprise , nevertheless evoked somehow an instant memory of allp339these other more domestic things . Long rows of costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three long tables , such as tailors use , were strewn other garments , dresses , jackets , bits of lace or trimming , the varied evidence of work and of repair . There were three women in the room . One , a small , plump , dark young woman , wearing glasses , was seated cross-legged at one of the tables , with a piece of cloth spread out across her knees and sewing quickly . She was a wonderfully deft and nimble-fingered person ; her small , plump hands were busy as a pair of beavers , and one could see the needle flashing through the air like a flight of arrows . Facing them under a bright light and seated at a sewing machine , was a woman stitching a piece of cloth . Seated farther away , behind these two women , was a third . She also was working on a piece of goods and had a needle in her hand . She was wearing a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles , and these emphasized the lean and sunken silence of her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somberly attired in a dress of dark material , the woman gave an impression of fastidious elegance . Perhaps this was partly due to her costume , which was so sober that a man would not even notice it , and yet so perfectly correct that he would not forget it later . But , even more , the impression was probably due to the sunken quietness of the woman 's thin yet not unattractive face , the thinness of her figure which looked rather tired and yet capable of constant work , and the movement of her white and rather bony hands . As they entered the room , the woman at the sewing machine looked up and stopped her work ; the other two did not . As they approached , she smiled and called out a greeting . She was somewhat younger than Mrs. Jack , and yet , by some indefinable token , she was also an " old maid . " She immediately conveyed to one , however , a sense of warmth and humor , and of kind good nature . She was certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fine-spun as silk , and it had all kinds of wonderful lights in it . Her eyes were blue and seemed full of wit , of shrewdness , and df humor , and her voice had this quality also . She got up as she spoke to them , and came around her machine and shook hands with the young man . The two other women acknowledgedthe introduction simply by raising their heads and speaking , and then returned to their work again . The little plump one seated cross-legged at the table seemed almost sullen in the muttered brevity of her response . The other woman , whom Mrs. jack introduced asp340her sister , Edith , simply looked up for a moment through her bony spectacles , regarding him with her large , somewhat sunken , and armysilenteyes , said , " How do you do , " in a voice so toneless that it halted all communication , and then returned to her work again . Mrs. Jack turned to the red-haired woman and for some moments they talked to each other about the costumes . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation , that they were good friends . The red-haired woman , whose name was Mary Hook , paused suddenly in her conversation , and said : " But you two had better be getting back , had n't you ? The act has started . " They listened . All below was silent . The actors had departed for the stage . All here was now silent , too , and yet waiting . All life had for the moment been here withdrawn ; but meanwhile , it had all concentratedthere . Meanwhile , here waited and was still . Mrs. Jack , after a startled moment , said quickly : " Yes  --  oh , well then  --  we must go . " They hurried down the stairs , along the corridor , and out to the now-deserted lobby . When they got back into the theatre , the house was dark again , the curtain had gone up . They slipped into their seats and began to watch . This act was better than the first . At the conclusion of each scene , Mrs. Jack leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest about some of the performers . One of them , a tough yet dapper little fellow , was a tap dancer who moved his legs and shot his feet out with astonishing agility , and scored a great success . She bent forward and whispered : " That 's Jimmy Haggerty . We wo n't be able to keep him after this season . He 's going on . " She did not explain what she meant by " on , " there was no need to : it was evident she meant that his star was now in its ascendency . In another scene , the star performer was a young girl of twenty . She was not pretty , but her quality of sexual attractiveness was such that , in Mrs. Jack 's own phrase , " it hit you in the eye . " It was shockingand formidable in its naked power . When the act was over and the girl walked forward to acknowledge the storm of applause , therep341was an arrogant and even insolent assurance in the way she received it . She neither bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased or grateful . She simply sauntered out and stood there in the center of the stage with one hand resting lightly on her hip , and with a sullen and expressionless look on her young face . Then she strolled off into the wings , every movement of her young body at once a provocation and a kind of insult , which seemed to say , " I know I 've got it , so why should I thank anybody ? " Mrs. Jack bent forward in her seat , and , her face flushed with excitement and laughter , whispered : " Is n't it awful ! Did you ever see such a brazen , sexy little trollop ? And yet  --  " her face grew thoughtful as she spoke  --  " she 's got it too . She 'll make a fortune . " He asked her about one or two of the others , about Roy Farley , the comedian . " Oh , Roy , " she said  --  and for a moment her face showed regret . " I do n't know about Roy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , as if she knew what she wanted to say but was having trouble in finding words to phrase it : " Everything he does is justjust  --  akind of imitation of someone else , and so he 's having a kind of  --  vogue  --  right now  --  but  --  " she turned and looked at him seriously  --  " you'vegot to have something else , " she said , and again her  --  w brow was furrowed by that line of difficulty between the eyeshe sought for an answer . " I do n't know  --  hut  --  it 's something that , ' ve got to have yourself  --  inside of you  --  something that is yours , and that no one else has . Some of those others had it  --  even that little slut with her hand on her hip . It may be cheap , but it 's hers  --  and its kinda wonderful . " For a moment longer she was silent , looking at him . " Is n't it strange , " she whispered , " and wonderful  --  andandsort of sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is just the way things are . Just something you ca n't help , and that no one can do anything about , and that nothing can make better . " Her face was touched for the moment with sadness , and then , irrelevantly it seemed , she said : " Poor things . " And the quiet pity in those words did not need a definition . When the show was over , they went out again into the lobby . Here some more people greeted her , and others said good-bye , but the place was clearing swiftly now as the cabs and motors drove away , and soon the house was almost empty . She asked him if he would go uptown with her , and invited him to come with her while she got her coat and hat and some costume drawings which she had left in what she called her " work room . " Accordingly , they went backstage again . The stage hands were quickly dismantling the set , stowing the flats , the sections , and the properties away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers had all hurried off to their dressing rooms , but as they mounted the stairs again they could hear their voices , this time gayer and more noisy , with a sense of release . Mrs. Jack 's " work room " was on the third floor , not far away from the costume room . She opened the door and went in . It was a place of ordinary dimensions with two windows at one end . There was no carpet on the floor , and , save for a drawing table near one of the windows , a chair and locker , there were no furnishings . Behind the table , a sheet of tracing paper with some geometric designs of a set had been pinned against the wall with thumb tacks , and beside this , hanging from a nail , was a T-square . Against the whitewashed wall it looked very clean , exact , and beautiful . Upon the table , which was a level sheet of white , beautifully perfect wood , a square of drawing paper had also been pinned down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also covered with designs , and elsewhereon the table were other sheets that were covered with swift , sketchy , and yet beautiful costume drawings . These little drawings , so full of quickness and sureness , were remarkable because , although they did not show the figure they were destined to portray , yet it seemed as if the figure was always there . There would be just the jaunty sketching of a jacket , an elbowed sleeve , or perhaps just the line and pleating of the skirt . Yet the sketches could not have been more eloquent and moving in their portraiture of life if a whole gallery of men and women had been drawn in . There was also a little cardboard model of a setting , pressed and folded into shape , a row of drawing pencils , each sharpened to the perfection of a point , of equal length , and perfectly in line , a little jar containing long-stemmed brushes , feathery as hair , and a little white fat pot , full of gold paint . She began to put some drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened her pocketbook and fumbled about in it , as women do , until she found her key . She laid the key down on thep343table , and then , before she closed her purse , she took out something white and crumpled that had been smoothed out and folded carefully , and just for a moment she held it against her bosom and patted it affectionately , at the same time looking at him with a childlike smile . " My letter , " she said proudly , and patted it again with her gloved hand . For a moment he stared at her , puzzled ; then , as he remembered what accursed nonsense he had written her , his face flamed red , and he started around the table after her . " Here , give me that damn thing . " She moved quickly away , out of his reach , with an alarmed expression , and at the other end she paused again , and , holding it against her breast , she patted it with two hands now . " My letter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a child uses , but speaking to herself , she said , " My beautiful letter where he says he will not truckle . " Tl , e words were deceptively innocent and for a moment he glared at her suspiciously , baffled . And then , like a child repeating to herselfthe sound of a word that fascinates her , she murmured : " He does not truckle . . . . He is no truckler . . . . " She slipped quickly around the table as he started after her again , his hand outstretched , his face the color of a beet : " Here , if you do n't give me that damn -- She slipped out of reach , across to the other side , and , still holding that damning piece of folly to her breast , like a child absorbed by some nonsense rhyme of its own fashioning , she murmured , " Britons never will be trucklers .... " He chased her around the table in dead earnest now . Her shoulders shaking with laughter , she tried to escape from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against the wall , and for a moment they struggled for the letter . She tried to keep it away from him , thrust it behind her back . He pinioned her arms and slid one hand down over hers until he had his hand upon the letter . Finding hercaptured , and the letter being forced out of her grip , she paused and looked at him , and said reproachfully : " Ah  --  you would n't be so mean ! Give me my letter  --  please . " Her tone was now so earnest and reproachful that he released her , and stood back , glaring at her with a look of guilty and yet angry shame . " I do n't blame you for laughing , " he said . " I know it soundsp344as if a damn fool wrote it . Please let me have it and I 'll tear it up . I 'd like to forget about it . " " Oh , no , " she said , softly and gently . " It was a beautiful letter . Let me keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and closed it ; and then , as he still glared at her with a guilty , baffled face , as if not understanding what to do , she held the purse against her breast and patted it with her gloved hand , looking at him and smiling with the proud , childlike smile he had seen before . Then they started to go out . She looked around and took the farewelllook that people always take of rooms where they have worked , each time they leave them . Then she picked up her key , handed him the brief case , thrust her purse beneath her arm , and turned out the light . A corner lamp from the street outside threw some of its radiance into the room , and across the white board of the table . They paused there , just for a moment , and then awkwardly he put his arm around her waist . It was the first time during the whole evening , the first time since the last meeting on the ship , that they had been alone and silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognitionof that fact was in the minds and hearts of each , they felt a sense of deep and strong embarrassment . He tightened his hold around her waist and made a half-hearted effort to embrace her , but she moved clumsily and uneasily , and murmured indefinitely , " Not here  --  all these people . " She did not say who " all these people " were , and indeed most of the people in the theatre were now gone , for the place was now silent ; but he understood that her embarrassment and confusioncame from the sense of this intimacy here where her associationswith her friends and her fellow workers were still so recent ; and he , too , feeling  --  he did not know why  --  a strong sense of embarrassment and impropriety , made no further effort , and in a moment clumsily withdrew his hand . They said no more , but opened the door and went out . She locked the door , and both of them went down the stairs together , still with that strange feeling of confusion and constraint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither of them knew what to say . Below , the house was dark and quiet , but the old night watchman , an Irishman with a thick brogue , let them out into the street through the stage entrance . The streets around the theatre also looked barren and quiet , and after the so recent gaiety and brilliance of the performance and the crowd , the place seemed cold and sad . He hailed a taxi cruising past ; they got in and were driven uptown through the almost deserted streets of the East Side and the darkened stretch of lower Broadway . She would not let him take her home , but left him in front of his hotel . They shook hands and said " good night " almost formally . Theypaused and looked at each other for a moment with a troubled and confused look , as if there was something that they wanted to say . Butthey could not say it , and in a moment she was driven away ; and with a sad , bewildered , and disappointed sense of something baffled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hotel and up to his small room.  | OUT OF THE NAMELESS AND UNFATHOMED WEAVINGS OF BILLION-FOOTED life , out of the dark abyss of time and duty , blind chance had brought these two together on a ship , and their first meeting had been upon the timeless and immortal seas that beat forever at the shores of the old earth . Yet later , it would always seem to him that he had met her for the first time , had come to know and love her first , one day at noon in bright October . That day he was twenty-five years old , she had said that she would meet him for his birthday lunch ; they had agreed to meet at noon before the Public Library . He got there early . It was a fine , shining day , early in October , and the enormous library , set there at the city 's furious heart , with its millions of books , with the beetling architectures that towered around it , and the nameless brutal fury of the manswarm moving - around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible mockery of repose and study in the midst of the blind wildness and savagery of life , to drown his soul with hopelessness , and to fill him with a feeling of weariness and horror . But now his excitement and happiness over meeting her , together with the glorious life and sparkle of the day , had almost conquered these feelings , and he was conscious of a powerful , swelling certitude of hope and joy as he looked at the surging crowds upon the street , the thronging traffic , and the great buildings that soared up on every side with a sheer and dizzy frontal steepness . It was the day when for the first time in his life he could say , " Now I am twenty-five years old , " and , like a child who thinks that he has grown new muscle , a new stature over night , the magic numerals kept beating in him like a pulse , and he leaned there on the balustrade feelinga sense of exultant power inside of him , a sense of triumph for the mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p347A  young man of twenty-five is the Lord of Life . The very age itself is , for him , the symbol of his mastery . It is the time for him when he is likely to feel that now , at last , he has really grown up to man 's estate , that the confusions and uncertainties of his youth are behind him . Like an ignorant fighter , for he has never been beaten , he is exultant in the assurance of his knowledge and his power . It is a wonderful time of life , but it is also a time that is pregnant with a deadly danger . For that great flask of ether which feels within itself the illusions of an invincibleand hurtless strength may explode there in so many ways it does not know about  --  that great engine of life charged with so much power and speed , with a terrific energy of its high velocity so that it thinks that nothing can stop it , that it can roar like a locomotive across the whole continent of life , may be derailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a time when a man is so full of himself , of his own strength and pride and arrogant conceit that there is not much room left at the center of his universe for broad humanity . He is too much the vauntinghero of his cosmic scheme to have a wise heart for the scheme of others : he is arrogant and he does not have a simple heart , and he is intolerant and lacks human understanding , for men learn understanding  --  couragealso !  --  not from the blows they give to others , but from those they take . It is the time of life when a man conceives himself as earth 's greatchild . He is life 's darling , fortune 's pet , the world 's enhaloed genius : all he does is right . All must give way to him , nothing must opposehim . Are there traces of rebellion there among the rabble ? Ho , varlets , scum -- out of the way ! Here 's royalty ! Must we rejoice , then , at the ! beatings which this fool must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creature also . He is a fool , but there 's a touch of angel inhint too . He is so young , so raw , so ignorant , and so grievously mistaken . And he is so right . He would play the proud Lord , brook insolences , and grind his heel into the world 's recumbent neck . Andinside the creature is a shaft of light , a jumping nerve , a plate so sensitivethat the whole picture of this huge , tormented world is printedthe very hues and pigments of the life of man . He can be cruel , andhate cruelty with the hate of hell ; he can be so unjust , and give histo fight injustice ; he can , in moments of anger , jealousy , orwounded vanity , inflict a grievous hurt upon others who have done him wrong . And the next moment , thrice wounded , run throughpinioned to the wall upon the spear of his own guilt , remorse , and scalding shame , he can endure such agonies that if there really were a later hell there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end the creature 's spirit is a noble one . His heart is warm and generous , it is full of faith and noble aspiration . He wants to be the best man in the world , but it is a good world that he wants to be the best man in . He wants to be the greatest man on earth , but in the image of his mind and heart it is not among mean people , but among his compeers of the great , that he wishes to be first . And remember this thing of this creature too , and let it say a word in his defense : he does not want monopoly , nor is his fire expended on a pile of dung . He does not want to be the greatest rich man in the world , to beetle up out of the blood-sweat of the poor the gold of his accretions . It is not his noble , proud ambition to control the slums , to squeeze out in his own huge ciderpress the pulp of plundered and betrayed humanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , to steal the greatestmine , to run the greatest mill , to exploit the labor and to profit on the sweat of ninety thousand lesser men . He has a higher goal than this : at very least he wants to be the greatest fighter in the world , which would take courage and not cunning ; and at the very most he wants to be the greatest poet , the greatest writer , the greatest composer , or the greatest leader in the world  --  and he wants to paint instead of own the greatest painting in the world . He was the Lord of Life , the master of the earth , he was the city 's conqueror , he was the only man alive who ever had been twenty-five years old , the only man who ever loved or ever had a lovely woman come to meet him , and it was morning in October ; all of the city and sun , the people passing in the slant of light , all of the wine and gold of singing in the air had been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was twenty-five years old . And then the golden moments ' wine there in the goblet of his life dropped one by one , the minutes passed , and she did not come . Some brightness had gone out of day . He stirred , looked at his watch , searched with a troubled eye among the thronging crowd . The minutes dropped now like cold venom . And now the air was chilled , and all the singing had gone out of day . Noon came and passed , and yet she did not come . His feeling ofP349jubilant happiness changed to one of dull , sick apprehension . He began to pace up and down the terrace before the library nervously , to curse and mutter , already convinced that she had fooled him , that she had had no intention of coming , and he told himself savagely that it did not matter , that he did not care . He had turned and was walking away furiously towards the street , cursing under his breath , when he heard a clatter of brisk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice raised above the others , callinga name , and though he could not distinguish the name , he knew at once that it was his own . His heart gave a bound of the most unspeakablejoy and relief , and he turned quickly , and there across the pavement of the court , threading her way through the fast weavings of the crowd , he saw her coming towards him eager and ruddy as an apple , and clad in rich , russet , autumnal brown . Bright harvestings of young October sun fell over her , she trotted towards him briskly as a child , with rapid step and short-paced runs . She was panting for breath : at that moment he began to love her , he loved her with all his heart , but his heart would not utter or confess its love , and he did not know of it . She was so lovely , so ruddy , and so delicate , she was so fresh and healthy-looking , and she looked like a good child , eager and full of belief in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ache of bitter , nameless joy and sorrow in him as he looked at her : the immortal light of time and of the universe fell upon her , and the feet swarmed past upon the pavements of the street , and the old hunger for the wand and the key pierced to his entrails  --  for he believed the magic word might come to unlock his heart and say all that he felt as he saw Esther there at noon in bright October on the day when he was twenty-five years old . He went striding back towards her , she came hurrying up , they came together in a kind of breathless collision and impulsively seized each other by the hands , and stood there so , panting , and for a moment too excited to speak . " Oh ! "  --  she gasped when she could speak . " I ran so ! ... I saw you walking away  --  my heart jumped so ! " And then , more quietly , looking at him , with a shade of reproach , " You were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " then paused , groping , not knowing what , in this intoxicationof joy and relief , he had thought . " I waited for you , " he blurted out . " I 've been here almost an hour  --  you said twelve . " " Oh , no , my dear , " she answered quietly . " I told you I had an appointmentat the costumer 's at twelve . I 'm a few minutes late , I 'm sorry  --  but I said twelve-thirty . " The emotion of relief and happiness was still so great that he scarcely heard her explanation . " I thought  --  I 'd given you up , " he blurted out . " I thought you were n't coming . " " Oh , " she said quietly but reproachfully again , " how could you think that ? You must have known I would . " For the first time now , they released each other from the hard clasp in which , in their excitement , they had held each other fast . They stepped back a little and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of himself , with delight . " Well , young fellow , " she cried in a jolly tone , " how does it feel to be twenty-five years old ? " Still grinning , and staring at her foolishly , he stammered : " It  --  it feels all right . . . . Gosh ! " he cried impulsively , " you look swell in brown . " " Do you like it  --  hah ? " she said , eagerly and brightly . She stroked the bosom of her dress , which was like the red one she had worn the first night at the theatre , with the kind of pride and satisfaction a child might take in its belongings . " It is one of my Indian dresses , " she said , " a sari . I 'm glad if you like it . " Arm in arm , still looking at each other and so absorbed that they were completely oblivious of the crowd , the people passing , and the city all around them , they had begun to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . On the curb they paused , and for the first time became aware of their surroundings . " Do you know ? "  --  she began doubtfully , looking at him  --  " Where are we going ? " " Oh ! " He recollected himself , came to himself with a start . " Yes ! I thought we 'd go to a place I know about  --  an Italian place on the West Side . " She took her purse from under her arm and patted it . " This is to be a celebration , " she said . " I got paid this morning . " " Oh , no you do n't ! Not this time . This is my party . " P351Meanwhile , he had stopped a taxicab and was holding the door open for her . They got in , he gave the driver the address , and they were driven across town towards the place that he had chosen . It was an Italian speakeasy on West 46th Street , in a row of brownstonehouses , of which almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York at that period must have containedthousands of such places , none of which differed in any essential detail from Joe 's . The setting and design of the establishment was one which a few years under the Prohibition Act had already made monotonously familiarto millions of people in New York . The entrance was through the basement , by means of a grated door which opened underneath the brownstone steps . To reach this door one went down a step or two from the sidewalk into what had formerly been the basement areaway , pressed a button , and waited . Presently the basement door was opened , a man came out , peered through the grating of the gate , and , if he recognized the visitor , admitted him . Within , too , the appearance of the place was one that had already grown familiar , through thousands of duplications , to city dwellers . The original design of a city house had not been altered very much . There was a narrow hallway which led through the place from front to rear , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , as one entered , there was a very small room for the hat-check woman . On the right-hand side , in a larger but still very dark and narrow room , there was a small bar . From the bar one entered through a door into a small dining room of about the same dimensions . Across the hall there was a larger dining room , which had been created by knocking out the wall between two rooms . And upstairs on what had once been the first floor of the house , there were still other dining rooms , and private ones , too , if one desired them . On the floors above were  --  God knows what !  --  more rooms and lodgings , and shadowy-looking lodgers who came in and out , went softly up and down the carpeted tread of the old stairs , and , quickly , softly , through the entrance of the upper door . It was a life secret , flitting , and nocturnal , a life rarely suspected and never felt , that never intruded upon the hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clatter of the lower depths . The proprietor of this establishment was a tall , thin , and sallow man with a kind of patient sadness , a gentle melancholy which one somehowliked because he felt and understood in the character of the man a sense of decency and of human friendliness . The man was an Italian , by name Pocallipo , and since he had been christened Giuseppe , the patrons of the place referred to it as " Joe 's . " The history of Joe Pocallipo was also , if one could probe that great catacomb of life that hives the obscure swarmings of the city millions , a familiar one . He was one of those simple , gentle , and essentially decent people whom circumstance , occasion , and the collusions of a corrupt period had kicked upstairs , and who did not really like this ruthless betterment . Before the advent of the Prohibition Act , he had been a waiter in a large hotel . His wife had run this same house as a lodging house , her clientele being largely derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all sorts . As time went on , the woman began to provide some of her guests with an occasional meal when they would ask for it , and Joe , whose skill as a chef was considerable , began himself , on his " off day , " to prepare a Sunday dinner , to which paying guests were invited . The idea , begun really as a kind of concession to the lodgers in the house , caught on : the meals were cheap , the food was excellent , people came and came again , returningoften with their friends , until Joe 's Sunday dinners had achieved a kind of celebrity , and the man and his wife were sorely taxed to accommodate the numbers that now came . This involved , of course , the taking on of extra service and the enlargementof the dining space ; meanwhile , the Prohibition Act had gone into effect , and now people at these Sunday dinners began to suggest the advisability of his serving wine to those who wanted it . To an Italian , this request seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , that although prohibition was a law , the supply of wine , both new and old , was plentiful to those who could afford to pay for it . Although the price was high , as he soon found from investigation carried on among his friends and colleagues , who had also been led in some such way as this into the labyrinth of this strange profession , the profit , once the corks were pulled , was great . The remainder of the road was certain . There was a moment  --  just a moment  --  when Joe was faced with a decision , when he saw the perilous way this casual enterprise had led him into , when it was plain to him the kind of decision he had to make ; but the dice were loaded , the scales too weighted down upon one side to admit a balanced judgment . Before him lay the choice of two careers . On the one hand , heP353could continue working as a waiter in a big hotel , which meant the insecurity of employment , subservience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this way , as Joe well knew , the end was certain  --  old age , poverty , and broken feet . Before him on the other hand lay a more perilous and more ruthless way , but one made tempting by its promise of quick wealth . It was a way that would lead him , if not into full membership in the criminal underworld , at least into collusion with it ; into a bought-and-paid-for treaty with the criminal police ; and to violence , dishonesty , and crime . But it promised to him also wealth and property and eventual independence , and , like many anothersimple man of the corrupted period , it seemed to him there was no choice to make . He made it , and the results within four years had been more glitteringthan he had dared to hope . His profit had been enormous . Now he was a man of property . He owned this house , and a year before he had bought the next one to it . He was even now considering the purchaseof a small apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich man now , he was destined to be a very rich one soon . And yet  --  that sad , dark face , that tired eye , the melancholy patience with a quiet tone . It was all so different from the way he thought it would turn out  --  so different from the life that he had thought he would have . It was , in some ways , so much better ; it was , wearily and sadly , so much worse  --  the dense enmeshment of that tangled scheme , the dark , unhappy weavings of the ugly web , the complications of this world of crime , with its constantly growing encroachments , its new and ever uglier demands , the constant mulctings of all its graft , of blackmail , and of infamy , the fear of merciless reprisal , the knowledge that he was now imprisoned in a deadly world from which he could never hope again to escape  --  a world controlled by criminals , and by the police , each in collusion with the other , and himself so tarred now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer any appeal left to him to any court of justice and authority , if there had been one . And there was none . So here he stood today , peering out behind the grating of his basementgate , a sad and gentle man with weary eyes , looking out between the bars of his own barricade to see what new eventuality the ringing of the bell had brought to him , and whether enemy or friend . For a moment he stood there , looking out through the bars with a look of careful anxiousness ; then , when he saw the young man , his face brightened , and he said : " Oh , good morning , sir . Come in . " He unlocked the door then and held it open for his visitors as they came in , smiling in a gentle , kindly way , as they passed him . He closed the gate behind them and stood aside while they went in . Then he led the way along the narrow little corridor into a dining room . The first one they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one behind was empty . They chose this one , and went in and took a table , Joe pulling back the chairs and standing behind Mrs. Jack until she was seated , with the air of kind and gentle dignity that , one felt , was really a part of the decency and goodness of the man . " I have not seen you for so long , sir , " he said to the young man in his quiet voice . " You 've been away ? " " Yes , Joe , I 've been away a year , " said the young man , secretly warmed and pleased that the man should have remembered him , and a little proud , too , that this mark of recognition should be given in front of Mrs. Jack . " We 've missed you , " Joe said with his quiet smile . " You 've been in Europe ? " " Yes , " the other said casually , but quite pleased just the same that the proprietor had asked him , for he was at that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was there a year , " he added , and then realized that he had said something of this sort before . " Where were you ? " Joe inquired politely . " You were in Paris , sir , I am sure , " he said and smiled . " Yes , " the other answered carelessly , with just a trace of the nonchalanceof an old boulevardier , " I lived there for six months , " he said , tossing this off carelessly in a tone of casual ease , " and then I stayed in England for a while . " " You did not go to EEtaly ? " inquired Joe , with a smile . " Yes , I was there this Spring , " the traveler replied in an easy tone that indicated that this season of the year was always the one he preferedwhen taking his Italian holiday . He did not think it worth mentioning that he had gone back again in August to sail from Naples : that trip hardly counted , for he had gone straight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , EEtaly is beautiful in Spring , " Joe said . " You were at Rome ? " " Not long , " said the voyager , whose stay in Rome , to tell the truth , had been limited to a stop between trains . " In the Spring I remainedp355in the North "  --  he tossed this off with some abandon too , as if to say that at this season of the year " the North " is the only portion of the Italian peninsula that a man of cultivated taste could tolerate . " You know Milano ? " said Joe . " Oh , yes , " the other cried , somewhat relieved to have some place mentioned at last that he could honestly say he did know . " I stayed there for some time "  --  a slight exaggeration of the fact , perhaps , as his sojourn had been limited to seven days . " And Venezia , " he went on quickly , getting a lascivious pleasure from his pronunciation of the word . " Venezia is very beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milano , is n't it ? " " No , near Turino , sir , " Joe replied . " And the whole place here , " the youth went on , turning eagerly to Mrs. Jack  --  " all the waiters , the hat-check girl , the people out in the kitchen , come from that same little town  --  do n't they , Joe ? " " Yes , sir , yes , sir , " said Joe smiling , " all of us . " In his quiet and gentle way he turned to Mrs. Jack and with a movement of the hand explained : " First one man came  --  and he writes back that he is doing "  - -  he moved his shoulders slightly  --  " not so bad . Then others came . Now , I think we are more here than we are left at home . " " How interesting , " murmured Mrs. Jack , pulling off her gloves and looking around the room . " Look , " she said quickly , turning to her companion , " could you get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . " " Well , of course , " said Joe . " You can have anything you like . " " It 's my birthday , Joe , and this is my birthday party . " " You shall have everything . What will the lady drink ? "  --  he turned to her . " Oh , I think  --  " she meditated a moment ; then , turning to the youth , said brightly , " A nice Martini  --  hah ? " " Yes , I 'll have that too . Two of them , Joe . " " Two Martinis . Very good , very good , " said Joe , with an air of complaisance , " and after that ? " " Well , what have you ? " He told them what he had , and they ordered the dinner  --  antipasto , minestrone , fish , chicken , salad , cheese , and coffee . It was too much , but ! hey had the spirit of true celebrants : they ordered a quart flask of Chianti to go with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , " said Mrs. Jack . " I saved it for you . " Joe disappeared and they could hear him giving orders in fast Italian . A waiter brought two cocktails on a tray . They clinked glasses and Mrs. Jack said , " Well , here 's to you , young fellow . " She was silent for a moment , looking at him very seriously , then she said : " To your success  --  thereal kind  --  the kind you want inside of you  --  the best . " They drank , but her words , her presence here , the feeling of wonderfulhappiness and pride that the day had brought to him , a sense that somehow this was the true beginning of his life , and that a fortunate and happy life such as he had always visioned now lay immediately before him , gave him an exalted purpose , the intoxication of a determined and irresistible strength that even drink could add nothing to . He leaned forward across the table and seized her hand in both of his : " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do it ! " " You will , " she said , " I know you will ! " And putting her other hand on top of his , she squeezed it hard , and whispered : " The best ! You are the best ! " The wild happiness of that moment , the mounting total of that enchantedday left now only the overpowering sense of some miraculous consummation that was about to be realized immediately . It seemed to him that he had " the whole thing " within his grasp  --  what , he did not know , and yet he was sure that he had it . The concrete distillation of all this overwhelming certainty , this overwhelming joy  --  that the great success , the magnificent achievement , the love , the honor , and the glory were already his  --  lay there palpable , warm and heavy as a ball does , in his hand . And then , feeling this impossible realization so impossibly near that he already had it in his grasp , feeling this certitude so exultantly , the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew exactly what certitude and purpose were  --  feeling the language he had never uttered so eloquently there at the very hinges of the tongue , the songs that he had never sung , the music he had never heard , the great books , the novels , the poems he had never fashioned  --  they were all so magnificently , so certainly his that he could utter them at any moment  --  now  --  a moment after  --  within five minutes  --  at any moment that he chose to make them his ! That boiling confidence of wild elements proved too much for the fragile tenement of flesh , of bone , of thinking , and of sense that it inhabited , and he began to talk " a blue streak . " As if every secret hope , P357every insatiate desire , every cherished and unspoken aspiration , every unuttered feeling , thought , or conviction that had ever seethed and boiled in the wild ferment of his youth , that had ever rankled , eaten like an acid in the secret places of his spirit , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed through pride , through fear of ridicule , through doubt or disbelief , or because there was no other ear to hear him , no other tongue to answer back , to give them confirmation  --  this whole tremendous backwater of the spirit burst through its walls and rushed out in an inundating flood . The words rushed from him in wild phrases , hurled spears , flung and broken staves of thought , of hope , of purpose , and of feeling . If he had had a dozen tongues , yet he would not have had the means to utter t hem , and still they charged and foamed and thrust there at the portals of his speech , and still not a thousandth part of what he wished to say was shaped or uttered . On the surface of this tremendous superflux he was himself whirled and swept away like a chip , spun round and carriedonward , helpless on his own raging flood ; and finding all the means at his disposal insufficient , failing him , like a man who pours oil on a raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them clown . IIc became very drunk . He became more wild , more incoherent all the time . And yet it seemed to him that he must say it finally , get it out of him , empty himself clean , get it all clear and straight and certain . When they got out in the street again , darkness had come and he was still talking . They got into a cab . The thronging streets , the jammed congestion of the traffic , the intolerable glare , the insane kaleidoscope of Broadway burned there in his inflamed and maddened vision , not in a blur , not in a drunken maze , but with a kind of distorted and insaneprecision , a grotesque projection of what it really was . His baffled and infuriated spirit turned against it  --  against everyone , everything  --  against her . For suddenly he realized that she was taking him home to his hotel . The knowledge infuriated him , he felt that she was deserting him , betraying him . He shouted to the driver to stop , she caught hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , he wrenched free , shouted at her that she had gone back on him , sold him out , betrayed him  --  that he wanted to see her no more , that she was no good  --  and even while she pled with him , tried to persuade him to get back into the car with her , he told her to be gone , slammed the door in her face , and lunged away into the crowd . P358The whole city now reeled past him  --  the lights , the crowds , the glitteringvertices of night , now bedimmed and sown with a star-flung panoply of their nocturnal faery  --  it all burned there in his vision in a pattern of grotesque distortion , it seemed cruel and insane to him . He was filled with a murderous fury , he wanted to batter something into a pulp , to smash things down , to stamp them into splintered ruin . He slugged his way through the streets like a maddened animal , he hurled himself against the crowd , lunged brutally against people and knocked them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a kind of apathy , he reached the end of that blind and blazing passage , he found himself in front of his hotel , exhausted , sick , and with no more hope for a singing in his heart . He found his room , went in , and fell senseless and face downward on the bed . The flask of ether had exploded .   SHE TELEPHONED NEXT MORNING A LITTLE AFTER NINE O'CLOCK . HE stirred , groaned , and sat up dizzily with a head full of splitting rockets , sick at heart and sick at stomach , and buried at the bottom of a pit of shame . " How are you ? " she said quietly , at once , in the tone people always use on such occasions , which is neither very sympathetic nor forgiving , hut just a flat interrogation of a fact . " Oh . . . well , pretty bad , " he said morosely . " I . . . guess I was pretty bad yesterday . " " Well  --  " she hesitated , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . He groaned to himself , and he said miserably and without much hope , " I 'm sorry , " having the feeling a man has on such occasions that mere sorrow does not make things right . " Have you had any breakfast yet ? " she said . " No . " His stomach turned at the thought of it . " Why do n't you get up now and take a shower ? Then go out somewhere and get your breakfast , you 'll feel a lot better when you do . It 's : i beautiful day , " she went on . " You ought to get out and take a walk . It would do you lots of good . " It seemed to him that he could never again take an interest in such things as breakfast , walking , or the weather , but he mumbled that he would do as she advised , and she went on at once as if outlining a practical working program for the day : " And what are you going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so impossibly far away , it conjured up such melancholy vistas of the miserable eternity that must elapse before night could come again to shelter his guilt in its concealing darkness that he could notP360answer for a moment . He said : " Oh , I do n't know  --  I had n't thought of anything . " And then , miserably , " Nothing , I guess . " " Because , " she went on quickly , " I was wondering if you would care to meet me tonight ?  --  That is , if you were n't doing something else . " For the first time , excitement stirred him , he felt hope . " But , of course I would , " he stammered . " You mean you would like to " Yes , " she said quickly and decisively . " Look  --  I wonder if you could do this . Could you come down here tonight after the show ? I mean  --  I did n't think you would want to sit through the whole thing again , and I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down a littleafter eleven , there 'd be more time and  --  maybe we could go off somewhere and talk . " " At what time shall I come ? ' " About a quarter after eleven ?  --  is that all right ? " " Yes , I 'll be there . And . . . and I 'd just like to say about yesterday ... about the way I " Well , that 's all right , " she interrupted him , laughing . " You get up now and do what I told you to do , and you 'll feel better . " He felt immensely better already , still dizzy and still queasy in the flesh , but with a tremendous lift and relief of the whole spirit , and he felt more hopeful of his life when he went downstairs . The performance was over and the theatre empty when he got to it that night . She was waiting for him in the lobby . They shook hands with a sense of formal constraint , and started backstage through the corridor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men were still about , but there was only a single light burning on the stage , a very big , bright one which cast a great light , but which gave to the shadows all around , in the vaulted spaces and the depths behind , the mysterious distance of a shadowy and unexplored dominion . Almost all the performers had departed . One of them had paused for a moment at the bulletin board and was scanning the announcements . As they started up the stairs , two more came swiftly down ; all spoke quick greetings as they passed and then hurried away , with the look of people who have finished their work . Upstairs , all was silent and deserted . She got out her key and unlocked the door of her own room ,  |p361and  they went in . The sound they made was the sound that people make when they are entering an empty place . " Look , " she said , " I thought I 'd get my coat and hat and we could go uptown  --  to a Childs restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved . I had only time to get a sandwich before the show , and I 've been going ever since . " She put her purse down on the table and turned to get her coat off the hook upon the wall . " I 'd like to say  --  " he began . " I 'll only be a moment , " she said quickly . " We can get started then . " He stopped her as she started to move away , and said : " I 'd like to tell you about yesterday . " The woman turned to him and took him by the hands . " Listen , " she said , " there is nothing to tell between you and me . There is nothing to explain . When I saw you on the boat I knew that I had always known you , and it has been the same way ever since . When I got your letter  --  " he winced , and she went on quickly  --  " when I saw the writing on the letter , I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found you and that I had always known you , and that it would always be the same . Yesterday , when I came to meet you , when I saw you , and you were walking away , the thought came to me you were leaving me . It was as if a knife had been turned and twisted in the heart , and then you turned , and you were there again , and then we were together and there were just you and I. And that 's the way it is , and I have always known you , and we are together . There 's nothing to explain . " A heavy door had slammed below , and for a moment there was the lean and lonely sound of footsteps walking away upon an empty pavement . Then there was nothing , just the hushed , still silence in the house . They stood there , holding each other by the hands , as they had done the day before , and this time there was nothing more to say , as if that stormy meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them , all confusion , all constraint , the need of any further explanation . They stood there with held hands and looked each other in the eye , and knew that there was nothing more to say . Then they came together and he put his arms around her and she put her arms around his neck and they kissed each other on the mouth .   MRS . JACk LIVED IN A HOUSE ON THE WEST SIDE , BETWEEN WEST END , Avenue and the river . At night she could hear the boats blowing in the river , and she could hear the ships putting out to sea . It was a five-story building of that familiar reddish brownstone which is now disappearing , but of which there were even then many miles left in the city . The material is ugly , but it is ugly with an evocative memory that is much more poignant and wonderful than most things that are considered beautiful . For in these ugly and desolate blocks of buildings of which the old New York was made , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " 1893 , " of " 19o4 , "  --  that lost time which is more remote , more strange , and , to some men , more beautiful , than the Middle Ages  --  and the sounds of those times are more lost than Persepolis . But the house in which Mrs. Jack lived was not ugly . It had an elegant and luxurious look . It was not lumpy and involved , with deep and dull indentures , or stiff , harsh , and angular , as many of these structuresare . The front was flat , plain , and delicate-looking , and to the left of the entry door there was one big , gleaming window of sheeted glass , in which there was always set an enormous bottle . The bottle was of green , delicate texture , so thin that it trembled to the touch , and gave forth a quivering , crystalline resonance . Whether this ornament had been set there deliberately by the expert and subtle theatricalism of its owner , or whether the magic intuition of her taste , which was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is impossible to say , but it remained in the memory forever after . That flat and elegant facade , set with its one great sheet of glass and its immense green bottle , was like a picture of its owner 's talent , which was delicate , opulent , and pure . Before this house Monk now stopped . He had come uptown by P363the subway ; with eager stride , he had walked down one of the streets that lead to the river , and walked along the Drive past Mrs. Jack 's street , trying to guess which house was hers . Then he had made a complete circuit of the block , and now he was here before her house . He mounted a step or two , rang the bell , and in a moment a young Irish woman in maid 's dress opened the inner door and let him in . He asked the girl if Mrs. Jack was there , told her his name , and in a thick , rich voice she said he was expected , and would he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paneled , and floored with a walnut tiling . Before he followed the girl upstairs he looked through a door she had left open and caught a momentary glimpse of young Irish maids around a table , and a big policeman with his coat off . They turned flushed and merry faces on him for a moment , there was a burst of music from a phonograph , the door was closed . Then he mounted the broad , dark stairs behind the girl . The house was somewhat narrowly built , but it was deep . There was just space for one big , nobly-proportioned room across its width ; those big rooms ran back three deep , there was an air of spaciousness and calm ; and the lovely and certain touch of the woman , which was at once delicate and immensely strong , was everywhere in the house . The furniture was old , and of a dozen different styles and periods . There were chairs , tables , chests of drawers marked with the incomparableclean simpleness of colonial America , there was a great chest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese silk upon the mantel , and a little green figure of one of the lovely and compassionate goddesses of infinite mercy , there were magnificent drinking glasses from Vienna , there were cupboards from the farmhousesof the Pennsylvania Dutch , and cabinets with the gay , crude little figures of the Bavarian peasants , there were wonderful knives and forks and spoons , heavy and plain , from eighteenth-century England . There was this great variety of times and fashions , and yet the result was not a hodgepodge of ill-assorted relics , but a living unity . These things fused warmly and beautifully into the unity of the house ; they had been chosen slowly , at many different times and places , because they were beautiful and useful , and because she had known they were right for her house . Everything in the house seemed to have been put there to give joy and comfort to people , nothing was there simply as a museum piece to be stared at , everything was in use , and everywhere there was the sense of tranquil dignity , ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would certainly have been justified , was that no one who ate or drank here ever went away hungry or thirsty . The house was one of the most hospitable and abundant places in the world . One of the finest elements in the Jewish character is its sensuous love of richness and abundance : the Jew hates what is savorless and stingy in life , he will not stand for bad food or dreary discomfort , he will not make jokes about them , or feel it a fine thing to cheat the senses . He feels there is something mean and degraded about poor living , he loves warmth and opulence , and he is right . This wonderful house , therefore , was one of the finest places in the world . Although modest in size and appearance , it was certainly unlikelythat anything to approach its warmth and beauty could have been found among the great establishments of England , where people have dozens of ancient rooms and scores of servants , but rub their raw , chapped hands over Brussels sprouts and mutton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where things are too gilt and brittle ; nor in Germany , where there is an immensely high , but immensely heavy , standard of good living . American joy is the sharpest and most exultant joy on earth : a house like this is set in a magical ether , and the belief in success and golden wealth and glory touches everything . So does it seem to a young man . For him , it is much better to know rich people than to be rich himself ; for youth , it is not wealth but the thought of wealth that is wonderful . The youth does not want money : he wants to be invited to the homes of rich people and to eat rich dinners , he wants to know wealthy and beautiful women , and to have them love him , and he fancies that just as their clothes , their stockings , all their garments are of the finest and rarest textures , so the texture of their flesh , the spittleof their mouths , the hair of their heads , and all their combining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of poorer people . Monk had never seen the inside of such a house as this one , nor was he accustomed to its subtle , rather worn quality and flavor , and at first he was disappointed man on the boat had said she was " immensely wealthy "  --  he had thought of thirty or forty million dollars , and he had expected the house to be something immenseand brilliant . Now it seemed to him old and a little shabby , P365but it also seemed friendly and comfortable . He was no longer afraid and awed by it as he had been before entering . As he turned to ascend the second flight of stairs he had a moment 's glimpse of the living room , with its worn and friendly look , and of low bookshelves all around the walls . There were hundreds , thousandsof books , but they did not have the stiff-bound , sumptuous look of the unread treasures in the houses of rich , unlettered people . The books had the warm , worn smell and coloring of books which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidently , he went up after the maid , and they passed by bedrooms , spacious and bright , with great four-poster beds and thick quiltings ; and finally , at the top of the house , they came to the little room which Mrs. Jack used as a workshop . The door was partly open , they went in , and Mrs. Jack , very businesslike and earnest , was leaning over her drawing table at work , and with one trim foot crossed jauntily before the other . She looked up as they entered . Monk was momentarily shocked because she was wearing horn-rimmed spectacles . They gave her small , delicate face a motherly appearance , and she peered at him comically over the top of the lenses , calling out in cheerful voice : " There you are , young fellow ! Come in ! " Then with a quick , nervous movement of her small hand she removed the spectacles , put them on the table , and came around to greet him . At once , now , she was the warm little creature he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , now , she became suddenly a little formal and embarrassed , she shook hands somewhat nervously and stiffly , and said : " Hello , Mr. Webber . How are you  --  hah ? " in a somewhat cracked , shrill , and impatient city voice . Then she stood rapidly slipping the ring on and off her finger with the nervous and impatient movement that worried and somewhat annoyed him . " Would you like to have some tea  --  hah ? " she said again in her somewhat protesting tone , and when he said " Yes , " she said , " All right , Katy bring us some tea . " The girl went out and closed the door . " Well , Mr. Webber , " said Mrs. Jack , still slipping the ring on and off , " this is my little room where I do my work . How do you like it  --  hah ? " He said that he thought it was a nice room , and added lamely , " It must be a fine place to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's the most wonderful place you ever hcard of . It 's simply marvelous , " she added solemnly . " You get the mostp366wonderful light here all day long , but now they 're going to ruin it all , " she said , gesturing out the window where the gaunt framework of a large building was being erected . " They 're putting up one of those big apartment houses , and it 's simply going to smother us . Is n't it a shame ? " she went on indignantly . " We 've lived here for years , and now they 're trying to drive us out . " " Who is ? " " Oh , these apartment house people . They want to tear down this whole block and put up one of those awful places . In the end I suppose they 'll drive us out . " " How can they do that ? Do n't you own the place ? " " Oh yes , we own it , but what can you do about it if they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around you , they 'll shut out all light and air  --  they 'll simply smother you . Do you think people have any right to do things like that ? " she burst out with her plain , kind indignation , which with her jolly , wholesome , and indignantly flushed little face was tremendously appealing , and gave people a tender and humorous feeling towards her , even when she protested angrily . " Do n't you think it 's dreadful  --  hah ? " " It 's too bad , it looks like a nice house . " " Oh , God , it 's a wonderful house ! " she said earnestly . " It is the most magnificent place you ever saw . Some day I want you to see it all  --  I ' 11 show you all around . When we leave this place I 'm going into mourning . " " Well , I hope you 'll never have to . " " Oh , we 'll have to , " she said gravely and sadly . " That 's New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I went by the house where I lived for a time as a girl . It 's the only house left on the street  --  all around it are these enormous buildings now . God , it was like a dream ! You know how time makes you feel ? It 's as if you 've lived forever or only five minutes , you do n't know which  --  there 's something strange and terrible about it . I got frightened and gazooky , " she said comically . " What 's gazooky ? " " You know  --  they way you feel when you are looking down from a high building . . . . I must have lived in that house a year or two . It was after my father died , and I was staying with my uncle . He was an enormous man , he weighed over three hundred pounds , and God !  --  how he loved to eat ! You would have adored him . The very best was just about good enough for that fellow ! " As she uttered thesep367words her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she emphasized the words by almost whispering them , and by pressing the thumb and forefinger of her strong little hand together and gesturingin a way that showed she meant something of almost superhumanexcellence by " the very best . " " Gee ! he was a grand fellow ! The doctors said he kept alive fifteen years longer by sticking to Scotch highballs . He used to start about eight o'clock in the morning and kept it up all day . You never saw anything like it in your whole life  --  the amount of liquor that fellow could consume . You just would n't believe it possible . And he was so smart  --  that was the strangestthing , it did n't seem to make any difference to his work . He used to be Police Commissioner , he was one of the best they ever had . He was great friends with Roosevelt , and Mr. Roosevelt used to come there to that house to see him . . . . God ! it all seems so long ago , and yet I remember it all so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she went on , laughing . " One night he took me to the opera , I must have been about sixteen , and God ! I felt so proud to be with him ! It was one of those operas of Wagner 's , and you know how everybody gets killed in them , and we were coming up the aisle just before the end and Uncle Bob came booming out , They 're all dead except the orchestra ! ' " Here her voice imitated the full , booming quality of the enormous man in such a way that one saw him vividly . " God ! I though they 'd have to stop the show ! You could hear him all over the place , his voice carried everywhere . " She paused , animated , laughing , flushed with the eagerness of her story . She paused by the river of life and time . And for a moment Monk had a blazing vision of lost time , he heard the strange , sad music that time makes . For here , delivered unto the punctual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memories of a lost world and the ancient days . The ghosts of the forgottenhours now moved about her , and the strange brown light of memory shed its unearthly glow upon the moment 's actual light . A vision of old prints and readings , a potent and evocative memory of a past Monk had not seen but which was mixed with his blood like the foods of the earth he lived on flashed through his spirit its vivid and unspeakable sorrow . He saw the moments of lost time , he felt the pang of hunger and intolerable regret that all lost time , and the thought of all the life thatP368has been lived upon the earth , and that we have never seen , awakes in us . He heard the myriad sounds of the forgotten feet , the speech and movement of the tongueless dead , the vanished clatter of hoof and tire  --  things lost , and lost forever . And he saw forgotten fumeflawsof soft smoke about Manhattan , the vanished cleavings of bright ships upon the endless waters , the forest of masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derbied men who , caught in some casual moment of a nameless day by an old camera , paused , in their broken stride , in queer and incompleted gestures , as they moved out of time across the Bridge . All these had cast their shadows on this delicate and rosy-hued face , all these had left their echoes in her memory , and she stood here now , a child , a woman , a phantom , and a living being  --  the fleshly unity that bound him suddenly to the ghostly past , a miracle of deathling loveliness among great spires and ramparts , a jewel found by chance upon the seas , a part of the enormous wistfulness and lonelinessof America , where all men wander and are sick for home , where all things change but change itself , where even the memory and relic of love falls to the wrecker 's hammer , gapes for a moment like a ruined wall upon the earth 's blind eye , and then is drawn under and erased by the unrelenting tides of change and movement . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the flower face ; it was October , nineteen twenty-five , and dark time was flowing by her like a river . Shall we save one face from the million faces ? Shall we keep one moment from the adyts of lost time ? Was no love living in the wilderness , and was there nothing but the snarl and jungle of the streets , the rasp and driven fury of the town ? No love ? Was no love living in the wilderness , and was there nothing but unceasing dying and begetting , birth , growth , pollution , and the cat 's great snarl for blood and honey ? Was there no love ? We shall scorn scorners , curse revilers , mock at mockers . Have they grown wise on dust and alum ? Do they speak truly because their tongues are bitter ? Have they seen clearly because their eyes are blind ? Is there no gold because the sands are yellow ? It is not true . They 'll build great bridges yet and taller towers . But a vow has lasted where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city perished ; and faith has lived when flesh grew rotten.  |p369Mrs  . Jack was fair ; she was fair , she had dove 's eyes ; and in all the world there was no one like her . For a moment the woman paused , looking out of the window , smiling gently , and with that musing and tranquil expression touched with sadness that people have when they remember lost faces and lost laughter , and the innocence of old joy . The strong , delicate light of the late sun shone on her face without violence or heat , with its remote , fading , and golden glow , and for a moment she passed into a deeper revery , and he saw the look on her face that he had seen once or twice before on the ship , and which already had power to wound his suspicion and to awake in him a jealous curiosity . It was a somber , dark , and passionate look that transformed her merry and eager face with an expression of brooding intensity . Suddenly , he noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing , giving a masklike grief , an almost Slavic and undecipherablepassion to her face , and he was pierced with a bitter desire to know the secret of this look . It had in it a strange , animal bewilderment . He noted her low skull , now contracted by a frown of perplexity , as if her brain was struggling with some grievous thing in life it could not fathom . In a moment she had passed from the simple and eager interest , the lively and childish curiosity which drew her senses outward and seemed to fill her with a constant and sensuous delight in all the life and movement of the earth , into an inner and remote absorption from which the world was excluded . The look had in it so much perplexity and pain , so much dark grief and brooding passion , that it awakened in him a feeling of bitter mistrust . He felt tricked and cheated and baffled by a cleverness and subtlety of living that was too old , too wise and crafty , for him to fathom or contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lively human things , even her merry and rosy face of a delicate and noble beauty , were not merely some apparatus of concealmentand escape from this secret thing that dwelt in her , if they were not merely an appearance calculated to deceive the world , and if , left to herself , unoccupied by any work or amusement , she would not plunge immediately into this somber mood.  | What was it ? Was it the memory of some definite and painful loss , the thought of some lover who had left her , the recollection of some grief from which she had never recovered ? Was it the thought of some man , some unknown lover , from whom , perhaps , she had parted that Summer in Italy ? Was it some young man like himself , some boy , she coveted ? Were her thoughts , from which he was now completelyexcluded , focused upon this passion and this person ? Was he merely the substitute to this desire , the second-hand assuagement ? He told himself that he did not care , and surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which simply connected this woman to the great number of wealthy and fashionable women who are constantly seeking new loves and lovers , should have enabled him to accept such a situation without regret . But now he felt instead the stab of jealousy : without being willing now to admit either desire or love for her , he wanted her to admit them for him . He wanted to be loved and preferred above all others . A sinister vision of the city blazed in his mind . Instead of the golden and exultant vision of the city which he had known in childhood , this vision was drawn in lines of lust and cruelty , peopled with faithless loves and treacheries , inhabited by the conspirators of passion  --  by a world of rich , sensuous , and unsated women , of professional Don Juans , of lesbians , pederasts , and the cruelly impotent , of sterility that battened on pain , of the jaded appetites that could be spurred only by the sight of grief and madness  --  these figures appeared to mock the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he discovers that his love has been made the spectacle of a peep-show audience . Or was this woman 's somber and passionate revery only a token of some less definite and less personal sorrow ? Was it simply the sign of a state of brooding consciousness which , inarticulate and directedtowards no thing or person , felt deeply and wordlessly the tragic underweft of life , the loss of youth , the approach of age and death , the inescapable horror of time ? He remembered now how quietly and with what fatal decision she had said the last night on the ship : " I want to die  --  I hope that I die in a year or two . " And when he had asked her why , she said with this same look of animal-like perplexity on her face : " I do n't know . . . . I just feel finished . . . . It seems that I 've come to the end of everything . . . . There 's nothing more that I can do . "  |p371The  statement had exasperated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately to live , and because there had been no hysteria or sudden grief in the way she said it . The way in which she had spoken had a curious flatness , a desolate perplexity , as if she had really come to the end of all desire , and of all her resources , and as if she felt convinced that no new or beautifulthing could in the future be added to the sum of her life . The contrast between this moment of desolate and hopeless resignationand Mrs. Jack 's usual state of merry and joyful absorption with the details of living was so great that he felt anger and mistrust : if this sense of vacancy and tragedy dwelt in her always , then how far could one trust this simple and eager appearance she made before the world , this presentment that was so lovely , sensuous , so full of delight , sweetness , and humor , and that made people love her ? He could not feel that she was practicing some specious and complexfraud upon the world . Such an idea seemed ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play such a part , and he felt the mistrust and pain one feels when he discovers unsuspectedand bewildering depths and complexities in the character of a person he thought was simply and easily understood , and that he had come to know . Now , even the plain , frank , and simple way she had of talking  --  her frequent , yet very straight and natural-sounding , use of such words as " fine , " " grand , " " marvelous , " and occasionally " swell "  --  seemed , together with her jolly and rosy little face , and her whole manner of honesty , simplicity , and directness , to be part of the deceptivemechanism of an immensely complex , old , and sophisticated spirit . Mrs. Jack not only made use of this kind of rough-simple argot that was at that time coming into fashion among sophisticated people , but it really seemed to be a part of her life and character , and she seemed to use it with complete honesty and sincerity , along with a speech that was plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homely , and colloquial metaphor , a concrete descriptive power that made use of the good , straight words of common speech , but that was absolutely her own , and that seemed to come out with an immense , spontaneous inventiveness as she talked , and to be drawn out of the experience and feeling of her own life . For example , in describing the terrible heat on the pier the dayP372the ship had docked , she said : " God , was n't it awful ! I thought I was going to melt away before I got out of there ! I just wanted to unscrew my head from my shoulders and drop it down into a well of nice cold water to soak a while ! " And this image of coolness and refreshment so delighted her that she went on , with her ruddy little face glowing with humor , delight , and eagerness as she described how it might be done : " Would n't it be wonderful if you could do a thing like that ? " she cried . " I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hated it when it got hot in the Summer ; they made us wear so many clothes in those days , it was simply horrible ! I used to think how fine it would be if I could just unscrew my head and drop it down a well to soak  --  I could see the whole thing just as plain as day , " she went on with her face flushed with laL hter . " I 'd give my head a little turn  --  it would go Twirk ! ' " she said comically , " and there it would be all ready to go down into the well . Then after I 'd let it soak a while I 'd pull it back again , and put it on  --  and it would go Twirk '  --  and there I 'd have it , cool and clean , back on my head again ! Is n't it wonderful the things a kid can think of  --  hah ? " she demanded , with a merry , glowing , and delighted face . Her mind was full of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones all the time with a childlike fascination . Of some pompous actor , she would say with a disgusted scorn that yet had in it no real ill-humor or malice : " Say ! That fellow makes me sick with all the airs he gives himself . He 's so damned fancy that you would n't believe it 's possible till you see him . You know what his face looks like ? Well , I 'll tell you , it looks just like a piece of cold sliced ham ! " and , her face glowing with good humor , she would break into a delighted yell of full , rich , woman 's laughter . Finally , she would say in a quiet and very earnest tone of some person of her acquaintance : " Oh , he 's a very fine person ! He 's one of the finest people that I 've ever known ! "  --  and she would say this with such a straight , open , and engaging look of frankness and conviction on her earnest little face that one felt convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " fineness " of the person she spoke about . Yet , she made frequent use of these rough-simple words which fashionable and sophisticated people were beginning to use at that time , and in which there was something false , shameful , and sicken/ing when they said them . But now he wondered with an incoherent perplexity and confusion of spirit if she did not use these words for the same reason the other fashionable people used them  --  to give an appearance of simplicity , plainness , and straightforward honesty to a complex and subtle character that had no simplicity in it , but which was so immensely talented and able that she could use all the words and phrases a thousand times and with a sophistication so assured and certain that it could mask itself at every point with an impregnable illusion of simplicity . She was always using the word " fancy , " and it was evident that about the worst comment she could make on anyone was to call him " fancy . " Yet , remembering now things she had said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , open , and utterly convincinglook of sincerity  --  that she thought a play by James Joyce , Exiles , was " the greatest play that had ever been written , " and knowing that this play was nothing but a fancy and obscure little play , and not in any way to be compared with Ulysses ; and having heard her talk of D. H. Lawrence almost in the manner of a cult-adept , as if Lawrencehad not only given men fine books and moving characters but was himself a second Jesus Christ offering us the way to life and everlasting truth ; and having heard her say that she had been " psychoanalyzed , " and speak of psychoanalysis as the greatest truth that men had ever discovered , and the sudden means of healing all the fury , unrest , and madness that had afflicted the souls of men for twenty thousand years  --  having heard all this , together with her comments on African sculptures , primitive paintings , Charlie Chaplin . as a supremelygreat tragic artist , the modern dance , and all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricked out , and which , beneath its show of liberalness and alertness to new forms of art and life , was really itself nothing but a sterile , monotonous , and lifeless form of dutiful consent for people who had no power to make a new life for themselves , and whose greatest impulse was to keep in the swim  --  having already seen and observed in her all these disquieting signs of a familiar cult , he now wondered , in the distress and perplexity of his spirit , whether she was really an immensely competent " fancy " person pretending to be simple , or the simple , direct , and honest person that she seemed to be , who hated what was " fancy . " And his feeling on this point was so belligerent and resentful be- cause every time she used the word he would apply it to his own life , and remember the letter he had written her . Then he would writhe with shame and loathing as he remembered how pompous , florid , and unnatural it was , and yet how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life  --  how he had sweated real blood , and paid real anguish , desolation , and despair for something that was false . Then he remembered suddenly , too , that during that last night on shipboard she had confessed a compassionate nature , had been distressed because she " did not want to see him suffer "  --  and as he remembered her words , and the casual circumstance of their meeting , an intolerably painful suspicion awoke in him that if it had not been he it might have been another youth , that an opportune chance had simply put him in the way of a romantic woman at a moment when she wanted adventure . The whole scene of their meeting on the ship returned to his memory bitterly . He winced and tried to withdraw from it . He realized now that he wanted to forget or change it . A man can survey the general spectacle of living with the detachmentof a philosopher or a cynic , he can be amused by its delusions and follies , above all he can laugh at the madness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserts the general spectacle to become an actor in the show , his detachment vanishes , and when his heart and interest are involved , the conflict between general truth and particular desire causes doubt , pain , and suffering . And Monk felt something of this conflict now . What was she  --  a woman approaching middle age who dreaded its coming and wanted a lover , any lover ? No , a rare and beautiful woman who had preferred him above all others . What was his involvement with her  --  a part of the human comedy of folly and illusive desire , another repetition of the endless adventure of the infatuatedyouth , the gulled yokel , the country greenhorn for the first time in the city ? No , the miracle of chance , the met halves of the broken talisman , the jointure of the two true hearts , the beautiful and faithful lovers who had made their way through all the maze and tumult of this earth 's vast wilderness to find each other  --  the very proof and purpose of a destiny . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged in her somber and disturbing revery , suddenly he wanted to cry out at her angrily and violently : " What are you thinking about ? What is the meaning of this tragic and mysterious air ? Do you think youp375are so subtle I can not understand you ? You 're not so wonderful as all that ! I have thoughts and feelings just as deep as yours ! " For some time , lost in this dark and brooding revery which he could not fathom , Mrs. Jack had been leaning on her drawing table where her designs and some sketches for costumes were scattered . And now , unconsciously , impatiently , Monk struck the smooth white board of the table a smart blow with the flat of his hand . Immediately she started out of her revery , looked in a startled manner at him , slipped the ring nervously on and off her finger , and then , with a kind and eager look , she came towards him smiling . " What are you looking at , Mr. Webber ? Do you like my design-hah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said stiffly . " It 's very good , " although he had not looked at it . " I love to work here , " she said . " All the things you use to work with are so clean and beautiful . Look at these , " she said , pointing to the wall behind the table , where several of her instruments  --  a T-square and a triangle  --  hung suspended from nails . " Are n't they beautiful ? It 's as if they had a sort of life of their own , is n't it ? They are so clean and strong . You can do such delicate and beautiful things with them . Are n't they noble and dignified things , though ? " she continued . " It must be wonderful to be a writer like you are , and have the power to express yourself in words . " He flushed , glancing at her sharply and suspiciously , but he said nothing . " I think it is the greatest power in the world , " she continued earnestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so complete and satisfying . God , I wish I could write ! If I only knew how to put it down I know I could write a wonderful book . I 'd tell them a few things that would make their eyes stick out , all right . " " What sort of things ? " he now asked with curiosity and interest . " Oh , " she said eagerly , " all sorts of things I know about . I see the most marvelous things every day . Here is all this glory and richness around you , and no one seems to do anything about it ! Do n't you think it 's a shame  --  hah ? " she said in the indignant and earnest tone that made people want to laugh . " I do . I 'd like to tell people about my work . I 'd like to tell them about these things I work with , " she said , rubbing her fingers gently along the soft , smooth board of the table . " I 'd like to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the sort of life things have in them  --  the way they hang from the wall , or the way they feel . God , I wish I could tell people about my work ! I should like to tell them what it 's like when I design ! The most wonderful and exciting thing goes on inside me , and no one has ever asked me about it , nobody has ever tried to find out what it is that happens , " she said indignantly , as if she held some person responsible for this stupid neglect . " Is n't it a shame ! .. . Gee , I 'd love to put down the things I see every time I go out in the street . It gets richer and more beautiful all the time . I keep seeing new things now that I used not to notice at all . . . . Do you know what is one of the most wonderful things in the world ? " she demanded abruptly . " No , " he said in a fascinated tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said impressively , " I ' 11 tell you  --  it 's the window of a hardware store . . . . I passed by one going downtown the other day , and God !  --  it was so wonderful I stopped the car and got out . There were all these strong and beautiful instruments , they made a wonderfulkind of pattern , it was just like some strange , new kind of poetry . ... And oh , yes ! I should like to tell the way the elevated structure looks when you come down some cross street to it . Sometimes at evening it makes the most wonderful design against the sky  --  I should like to paint it . . . . Then I should like to tell about all the different people I see , the clothes they wear . I should like to write down what I know about clothes . It is the most fascinating thing in the world , and nobody seems to know anything about it . " " Do you ? " he said . " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do I know a lot about it ! " she cried . " And he asks me if I know a lot about it ! " she exclaimed comically , and Jewishly raised her palms to the attendant universe . " Let me at him ! " she said with a jolly burlesqueof pugnacity . " Just let me at him ! Well , young fellow , all I got to say is , if you find anyone who knows more about it than your old Esther , you 're going to have to get up pretty early in the morning . That 's all I 've got to say about it ! " He was somehow delighted by the joy she took in her skill and knowledge ; her boastfulness was so gay and good-humored that no one could be displeased with it , and he felt sure now that it was entirely justified . " Oh , I know the most marvelous things about clothes , " she went on solemnly . " There 's no one who knows the things about clothesp377that I do . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . You know , I 've got a job working for a big dressmaking place downtown . I go in two mornings a week and design for them . It is the most wonderful place to work , I wish you could see it . It 's so clean and spacious , they have these big , quiet rooms , and all around you everywhere they have bolts and bolts of beautiful material . There 's something so magnificentabout all this cloth , it is noble and beautiful , you can do such wonderful things with it . I love to go back to the work room and watch all the little tailors at work . You know , they 're very fine workmen , some of them get paid two hundred dollars a week . And God ! " she exclaimed suddenly , her little face deepening with a rich flush of humor , " how they stink ! It 's simply dreadful sometimes , you could cut the stink with a knife . But I love to watch them at their work . They have such delicate hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot it is like a kind of dance . " As the woman talked , a feeling of immense joy , peace , and certitude entered his spirit . He got from her a sense of strength , ease , and happinesswhich he had not felt before , and the doubts and confusion of a moment before had vanished . Suddenly the life of the city seemed opulent , glorious , and full of triumph for him , he felt able to conquerand subdue any obstacle , he forgot his horror and fear of the swarming life of the streets , and the terrible loneliness and impotent desolation of a human atom threading its way among millions , trying to make its life prevail against the horror of gigantic crowds and architectures . This little creature had found a way of life that seemed to him full of happiness and success : she was strong , small , and competent , she was also full of joy , tenderness , and lively humor , and she was immensely brave and gentle . He saw plainly that she was a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived in it all her life , and she loved it ; and yet she did n't have the harassed and driven look , the sallow complexion , the strident and metallic quality that many city people have . She was the natural growth of steel , stone , and masonry , yet she was as fresh , juicy , and rosy as if she had come out of the earth . There are some people who have the quality of richness and joy in them and they communicate it to everything they touch . It is first of all a physical quality ; then it is a quality of the spirit . With such people it makes no difference if they are rich or poor : they are really always rich because they have such wealth and vital power within them that they give everything interest , dignity , and a warm color . When one sees such a person in a lunchroom drinking a cup of coffee , one can almost taste and smell the full delicious flavor of the coffee : it is not simply one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best cup of coffee that has ever been made , and the person who drinks it seems to possess to the utmost every drop of its essence and flavor . Yet this is done without affected gusto , gourmandising , sighs , or smackings and lickings of the lips . It is a real and vital power this person has for joy and richness , it comes from the texture of his life , it can not be imitated . A tramp , a hobo , or a beggar often has this quality . It is a joy to see such a man thrust his hand carelessly into the baggy pocket of a ragged old coat and draw out a loose cigarette , put it in his mouth , light it with twisted lips and a flame cupped in his hard palms , and then draw the first pungent draft of smoke deeply and deliciously into his lungs , exhaling it presently in slow fumings from his nostrils with a naked lift of his teeth . The men who drive great trucks at night across the country often have this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow of lamps , they smoke ; their lives are given then to speed and darkness , they enter towns at dawn . The men who rest from labor have this power . The masons coming from their work who sit in trains and smoke strong , cheap cigars  --  there is something simple and innocent about such men as they look at their cheap cigars , held in their great stiff fingers , with pleased smiles . The sharp fumes drug their tired flesh with deep content . Those who have this quality are the young policemen sitting in shirt-sleeves in the all-night eating places , taxi drivers with black shirts , prize fighters , baseball players , and racing drivers , brave and gentle people ; steel workers sitting astride a giddy spar , locomotive engineers and brakemen , lone hunters , trappers , most shy and secret people who live alone , whether in the wilderness or in a city room ; in general , all people who deal with sensuous things , with what has taste , smell , hardness , softness , color , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical and active people , the creators . The people who do not have this quality are the people who rustlep379papers , tap keys  --  the clerks , the stenographers , the college instructors , the people who eat lunch in drug stores , the countless millions who have lived meagerly in pallor and safety . But when a person has in him the vitality of joy , it is not a meaninglessextravagance to say that " nothing else matters . " He is rich . It is probably the richest resource of the spirit ; it is better than all formal learning , and it can not be learned , although it grows in power and richness with living . It is full of wisdom and repose , since the memory and contrast of pain and labor are in it . It comes from competence , and it is touched with sadness , since the knowledge of death is on it . It has learned acceptance and regret , and it is nice because it sees that what is barren must be false . Mrs. Jack had this vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not merely a physical and sensuous thing , it was a richly imaginative and delicately intuitive thing ; it was full of faith and dignity , and she communicated it to everything she touched . Thus , as she drew his attention to the instruments and materials with which she worked  --  the drawing table , with its one smooth slab of soft white wood laid flat on trestles , the fat little pots of paint , the crisp squares of drawing paper , nailed with thumb tacks to the table , the neatly sharpened pencils and the delicate brushes , and the T-squares , sliding rules , and triangles  --  he began to feel the essence and vital beauty of these objects as he had never felt them before . Mrs. Jack loved these things because they were precise and delicate instruments , and because they served honestly and richly the person who knew how to use them . This warm and lovely talent served her everywhere with an unfalteringdirectness and certainty . Mrs. Jack wanted what was best and most beautiful in life , she was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know and appreciate it when she found it . In everything , she wanted only the best . She would not make a salad of wilted leaves : if the outer parts were not crisp and fresh , she would strip them off and use the heart . If she had possessed only two dollars in the world , and had invited some people to dinner , she would not stingily spread her money out in little dabs of one thing and another . She would have gone to the markets and bought there the best steak she could find for two dollars , she would have brought it home and cooked it herself until it was informed with all the succulence and flavor her own rich character could give it , then she would have servedp380it on a thick , creamy platter on a table adorned only by her big plates and the heavy and simple eighteenth-century knives and forks she had got in England . This would be all , but when her guests had eaten there would not be one of them who did not feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy and delight draw other people to them as bees are drawn to ripe plums . Most people have little power for living in themselves , they are pallid and uncertain in their thoughts and feelings , and they think they can derive the strength , the richness , and the character they lack from one of these vital and decisive people . For this reason people loved Mrs. Jack and wanted to be near her : she gave them a feeling of confidence , joy , and vitality which they did not have in themselves . Again , the world is full of people who think they know what they really do not know  --  other people have had their convictions and beliefs and feelings for them . With Mrs. Jack , it was at once obvious that she knew what she knew . When she spoke of the little tailors sitting cross-legged on their tables , and of the delicate and beautiful movements of their hands , or when she described the beauty and dignityof the great bolts of cloth , or when she spoke with love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one saw at once that she spoke in this manner because she had used and known all these things , she had worked and wrought with them , and her knowledge was part of her life , her flesh , her love , her marrow , her tissue , and was melted and mixed indissolubly with the conduits of her blood . This is what knowledge really is . It is finding out something for oneself with pain , with joy , with exultancy , with labor , and with all the little ticking , breathing moments of our lives , until it is ours as that only is ours which is rooted in the structure of our lives . Knowledgeis a potent and subtle distillation of experience , a rare liquor , and it belongs to the person who has the power to see , think , feel , taste , smell , and observe for himself , and who has hunger for it . As Mrs. Jack talked about herself and her life , and told in her vivid and glowing manner of her daily little discoveries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's life that was as different from the swarming horror of his own Faustine vision as anything could be . Hep381saw that the city , whose immensity drowned him in confusion and impotence , was for her simply what rich woods and meadows might be for a country child . She loved the unending crowds as a child might love a river or tall , blown grass . The city was her garden of delight , her magic island , in which always she could find some new joy , some new rich picture to feed her memory . She was like time , like the elfin light of time , because she gave the warm and magical color of distance and memory to things she had seen an hour before . In these stories to which her vivid and visual mind reduced experience , and in which her childhood and youth appeared so often , a picture of the old New York , and the old America , was already expanding and being given order and perspective in Monk 's mind . His own America was the America of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his potent and turbulent blood was a story of hundreds of men and women who had lived in loneliness , and whose bones were buried in the earth . The memory that lived in him was not the memory of men who had lived in paved and numbered streets , it was the memory of solitude and the distance and direction of the hunter and the frontiersman  --  a memory even now of men who " lived over yonder , " a memory of " a feller I was talkin ' to t' other day over in Zebulon , " a memory of men who lived " fist before you git to the fork of the road where it turns off to go down into that holler  --  you 'll see a big locust tree thar an ' if you jist foller along that path hit 'll take you right by his place  --  hit ai n't fer , not more'n a mile , I reckon  --  you cai n't miss hit . " Their greeting to strangers had been hearty , and their voices full of a deliberate kindliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mistrustful and sharp , and flickered rapidly , and the smoulderingembers of violence and murder were quickly fanned to fury in them . When they awoke at morning their eyes were fixed upon the calm and immutable earth , they watched the slow processional of the seasons , and fixed in their memory were always a few familiar things  --  a tree , a rock , a bell . The calm of the eternal earth and its elastic spring below man 's foot had been his inheritance . He had the experience of the country boy who comes to the city  --  his feet were tired of the endless pavements , his eyes were weary of incessant change and movement , and his brain was sick with the horror of great crowds and buildings . P382But now , in Mrs. Jack , he beheld a natural and happy product of the environment that terrified him , and in her warm little stories he began to get a picture of the city America he had not known , but had imagined . It was a world of luxury , comfort , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of theatres , books , artists , writers ; of delicatefood and wine , good restaurants , beautiful fabrics , and lovely women . It was a world of warm , generous , and urbane living ; and it all seemed wonderful , happy , and inspired to him now . In his countless goings and comings about New York , his rides in the subways , his walks through the streets , each one of which had become a savage struggle with life , sound , movement , and design until he now faced the simplest excursion among a crowd with tightened nerves and a sense of horror and dislike , he had often observed an expression on the faces of middle-aged New Yorkers which repelled and depressed him . The expression was surly , sour , and petulant , the texture of the flesh was grey and sallow , and it sagged in a doughy fashion . Upon these countenances there was legible a common story of mean and ungenerous living , of bad food eaten dully without distasteor enjoyment in cafeterias , of homes in dismal single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap hotels , ticket sellers in subways , cashiers in lunchrooms , as petty and ill-humored officials in uniform  --  the kind of men who snarl and bully and answer a civil question with an insolent reply , or who fawn in a whining and revoltingmanner when told that the stranger they have insulted is a person of importance to their employer : " Why did n't yuh tell me yuh was a friend of Mr. Crawford 's ? I did n't know ! If I 'd known you was a friend of Mr. Crawford 's yuh coulda had anything yuh like . Sure ! Yuh ca n't blame us . Yuh know how it is , " in a whining and confidential voice , intended to be ingratiating . " We got ta be careful . So many people comes here wantin ' to see Mr. Crawford that ai n't got no business to see him that he would n't have no time at all if we let ' em all in . Then if we let ' em in an ' they ai n't got no business to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how it is . " Upon these mean visages he had not been able to find any sign that would indicate any dignity or beauty in their lives . Their lives stretched back through a succession of grey and ugly days into that earlier New York of which he could get no picture except that it was dreary , and barren , and dull . He felt contempt , disgust , and pity forp383them . They were like small things that whine when threatened or beaten , and they belonged to that vast , drab horde who snarled , fawned , bickered , and whined their ways at length into nameless , numberless , and forgotten graves . And he hated these people , too , because they gave the lie to all his early country visions of a warm , magnificent , and opulent life in the great city . It seemed impossible that they should have come out of the same time and the same city as Mrs. Jack . In her stories of her childhoodand youth , of her wonderful , wild father who was an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her necklace when she needed money , of her fat Rabelaisian Christian uncles who were enormously rich and ate the most succulent foods , which they themselves went to market for every day , poking and prodding at the meat and vegetables , of her beautiful and generous Jewish aunt , of her Christian aunt , of her English relatives , her Dutch relatives , of her husband'sGerman relatives and her visits to them , of Mr. Roosevelt , and of actors , jolly priests , plays , theatres , cafes , and restaurants , of a great number of brilliant and interesting people  --  bankers , brokers , socialists , nihilists , suffragettes , painters , musicians , servants , Jews , Gentiles , foreigners , and Americans , he began to get fixed in his imagination an opulent and thrilling picture of the city in the Nineties and the early years of the twentieth century .   THEY HAD BEEN MEETING THREE OR FOUR TIMES EVERY WEEK . THESE hours and moments snatched from work , at noon time or late at night after the performance was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxicab , over the plates at lunch somewhere in Greenwich Village , or over the polished slab , the almost vacant privacy , of a Childs restaurant late at night , were very eager , very precious ones . But , as is usual with most lovers in the city , they were both troubled by the lack of that essential need of love  --  a meeting place : a meeting place not on the corner , in a cab , before a window , or on the street , shared emptily beneath the naked sky with all blind and brute participationsof the million-footed crowd , but a meeting place where they could be alone and which would be their own . Both felt increasingly a sense of this unhappy lack . To meet her at her house now seemed impossible  --  not from fear or inexpediency , and assuredly not from any shame , but because both had the sense of their own integrity . What they were , they were , and they felt no concealment , but they also had the sense of their own decency and propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre : here the sense of all her active life , her work , her association with her friends was still too recent , it still clung to her and hung like a troubling veil of mist above the life of each . As for the small hotel in which he lived , had meeting there been possible , the stupefactions of that place , the dreary contagion of its shabby lives , would have been too much for him . She solved the problem in a characteristic way , in a manner typical of the indomitable purpose which , he was to find , that small figure housed . And , rather comically , she found it by a demonstration of one of those processes of a woman 's mind by which she gets the thing  |p385that  she is looking for by pretending that she is looking for something else . She began to talk about " a place to work . " " Well , have n't you got one ? " " No , nothing that 's really good enough . Of course , that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the light was always good . But now those wretched people have come along and built a big apartmenthouse right in our backyard . So it has become too dark to work in now , and , besides , it 's so hard to work at home . You 're always being interrupted  --  you 're always having to answer the phone , talk to one of the maids , or one of the family is always coming in . " " What 's wrong with the room you 've got at the theatre ? " " Oh , that never was intended as a place to work . It was just a room they had left over where they used to hang costumes they did n't need any longer . They let me have it because I had to have some place to work and that was all there was . But it 's very difficult to work there , and it 's getting worse all the time . Some of the girls leave their things in there and are always coming in and out . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that I 'm getting all these other jobs to do outside , I really need a place  --  some place more uptown so that I will not be so far away from all these places where I have to go . " This was probably true . At any rate , she kept referring to her need of a new working place every day or two when they would meet . Finally , one day she met him in a state of jubilant excitement . " I 've a place , " she cried at once , even as she was pulling off her gloves , and before she sat down . " I 've been looking around all morning  --  mostof them were too depressing . " " You like this one ? " " It 's simply wonderful , " cried Mrs. Jack , with an air of astounded revelation . " In all your life you 've never thought of such a place . It 's up at the top of an old house , " she went on . " The kind of old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Only this one is all rickety and gone to seed . You think the steps are going to give way on you , and it 's very dirty . I do n't know , the whole place is empty now , but it looks as if it 's had a lot of sweatshops in it . But it 's been a beautiful house , " she cried , " a noble house . And I 've taken the whole floor . " " A whole floor ! " he exclaimed . " The whole thing ! " she gleefully affirmed . " In all of your life you 've never seen such space . There 's a place that you can spread yourself around in . "   " Yes  --  but it must cost a fortune . " " Thirty dollars a month , " she said triumphantly . " What ! " " Thirty  --  dollars  --  a  --  month ! " Mrs. Jack said slowly and impressively , and then , seeing a look of surprise and disbelief on his face , she went on quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . It 's really very much run down and out of repair , and I suppose they are glad enough to rent it at any price . But , oh ! " she cried rapturously , " Such noble space ! Such wonderful light ! Just wait until you see it ! " She was so eager to show him her great find that she could scarcely wait until he had finished with his lunch , and she seemed barely to touch hers . And he , too , stirred by her description and the elation of her discovery , felt a sharp excitement . After lunch they got up from their chairs immediately and went around to the new place . It was an old four-story house on Waverly Place that had obviously fallen on evil days . One mounted from the street by a rusty flight of steps . On the first floor as one entered there was a dingy-looking tailor shop . The hall stood open to the winds , the door having been wrenched from its fastening and hanging by one hinge . Then one went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrepit that it leaned crazily to one side as if its underpinning on that side was giving way . The stairs creaked heavily as one stepped on them , and the old rail sagged  --  it was as loose as an old tooth . Upstairs the place was dark and completely deserted . The only illumination was provided by a gas jet in the narrow hallway , which was kept burning night and day . In the walls along the stairs were niches , hollowed in the plastering ; they reminded her of a more prosperousand gracious day for the old house , when marble busts and statues had been stationed here . As they mounted they opened a door or two and looked in . The rooms were large and spacious , but they were very dirty and in a pitiable state of dilapidation . Apparently they had been used as work rooms of some sort , for there was a great tangle of electric wiring from the ceiling , and piles of rubbish on the bare floors , cardboard boxes , paper , bits of litter . Thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up those steep , winding stairs , they reached the top floor . P387They came up to a little landing , and stood before a door . The door was just a crude nailed-together kind of gate . It was fastened by a padlock and a bolted hinge . Mrs. Jack fumbled in her purse , produced a key , unlocked the door , and pushed it open . They went in . The room they entered was really a discovery . Like all the others they had seen , the place was very dirty , but it occupied the whole floor . Like all the others , this room too had been used apparently as a kind of factory : there was again a great tangle of electric wiring on the ceiling , and the fixtures for a great many electric lights . An old , roughlymade , dilapidated-looking table had been left in the room in a good deal of rubbish which she had already swept up into a pile . In the middle of the room there was a skylight opening from the roof , and the ceilings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great space and ample standing room in the central portion , one had to stoop a little as he approached the ends . The old whitewashed walls were dirty and in places pieces of plaster had been knocked out , leaving visible strips of dry brown plastering and dry lathing  --  the body and bones of the old house . The walls also bulged outward in places , and the bare wooden floor sagged and creaked as one walked across it . The whole place had the sag and lean of a old house , the worn modeling of time from which all sharp new edges and all solid holds have been worn away . She turned proudly and stood looking at him with a bright and hopefulsmile , as if to say : " There , now . What did I tell you ? Is n't it fine ? " He did n't say anything for a moment , but he was conscious at first of a feeling of disappointment . He had expected something grander and better kept , and for a moment the shabby dilapidation of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to walk back and forth across the length of the whole floor : the great space of the room and the sense it gave him of unimpeded and expansive movement delighted him . After the cramped confinement of his own small room , and all the cramped confinements of the city , where space had become the last and dearest luxury , this delighted him . The old floor gave and creaked precariously , and in one place it was so loose and giving that it seemed unsafe . But the sense of release , of quietness , and of privacy was wonderful . She watched him anxiously as he walked up and down : " Do you like it ? Of course , you have to stoop there at the end . But is n't it a wonderful room ? The space is so grand . And the light ! " sheP388cried . " Is n't the light marvelous ? It 's such a perfect light to work by . Do n't you think it 's grand ? " Through the skylight over her , the light came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal stultification of the streets , the unendingtumults of the city were here stilled ; and the effect upon his soul was like that quality of light itself , an effect of silence and of peace and of asylumage . She was talking now , quickly and enthusiastically as she moved around , already full of busy plans of renovation : " Of course , it 's very dirty . . . . It 's simply filthy ! But I 'm having a man in tomorrow to wash the windows and to scrub the floors . And I 'm sending some things down from the house  --  my drawing table and my instruments , an old couch that we 've no use for , and some chairs . You 've no idea what a difference it will make when it looks clean and has a few things in it . . . . I thought I 'd put my drawing table here ? Below this light ? Do n't you think so ? " She stood beneath the light and gestured to him . The strong , soft radiance came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so full of eagerness and hope , and for a moment he turned away , suddenly and deeply moved , he did not know why . When they went out she locked the door behind her , and for a moment , before she put the key away into her purse , she shook it in his face with a gleeful and exultant little movement , which plainly said , " This thing is ours . " Then slowly , carefully , holding each other by the hand , as people unaccustomed do , they started down those old winding stairs . The floor treads creaked and sagged below their feet , and behind them in the dark there was a sound of a single drop of water that gathered , swelled , developed , dropped , in its steady , punctual monotone , like the sound of silence in the old house of life , alone .   AMIRACULOUS CHANGE HAD BEEN EFFECTED IN MONK 'S LIFE , AND , AS SO often happens , he was scarcely aware at first that it had come . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not merely the fact of romantic conquest that had wrought the change : in its essential values it was probably this fact least of all . Much more than this , it was the knowledge that for the first time in his whole life he mattered deeply , earnestly , to someone else . Without being quite aware of it , this wonderful fact had an almost immediate effect on him . He was still likely to be crotchety , still too quick to take offense at a slight , whether real or imagined , still walking around with a chip on his shoulder daring someone to knock it off  --  but the chip was not so large now , nor so perilously tilted . He had a sense of inner security , of self-belief , that he had not had before . And he believed in himself because someone else believed in him . His war against the world was somewhat abated because his own war with himself was reconciled . As for all the minor grievances and annoyances , the surliness of nincompoops and the stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , venoms , gossips , rumors , and petty politics that poisoned the life of the School for Utility Cultures , where he worked , and the little flicks and darts of daily life that had at first whipped his spirit into lacerated scorn  --  all this had now slipped back into its proper place . He saw them as the trivialities they were , if not with equanimity , at least more temperately , in their true proportion . The woman had , in fact , begun to give a kind of frame , design , and purpose to his life that it had never had before . Although he did not know it at the time , she had herself become a kind of goal and purpose in his life , a kind of target at which his tremendous energies , so long exploded , scattered , misdirected , or diffused into thin air , could now be aimed . It would not be true to say that he actually " lived " for the timesP390when he would meet her . As a matter of fact , his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperately , and with a more proportionate judgment than it had done before . It was as if all the elements in his life had suddenly begun to take on the proportionate form , the balance in the distance , of a picture . He saw her now three or four times a week , but the sense of his contact with her life was daily , constant , and united . She called him up every morning , usually before he was out of bed . The sound of her quick , bright voice , itself already so full of life , morning , and of business , awoke in him a healthy desire to be up and at his work , for he was now writing furiously every moment he could snatch from his duties at the school . She would always be full of her plans and projects for the day  --  the places where she had to be , the appointments that she had to meet , the work she had to do . If she was going to be in his " part of town " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since she loved the work she did , she always brought to these meetings a sense of healthy energy , of happy activity , of the movement , the excitement , the vitality of the world itself . Occasionally they would meet for dinner in the evening , but more often he would meet her later , after the performance . He would make the long , excitingdrive into the East Side alone . Then they would leave the darkened theatre and come uptown together , usually stopping off at a Childs restaurant in a quiet neighborhood  --  their favorite one was on Fifth Avenue just above Madison Square  --  for a midnight lunch and an hour of talk together . It was not merely that he was in love with her . In addition to that , through his association with her it seemed to him that now at last he had begun to " know " the city . For , in some curious way , the woman had come to represent " the city " to him . To him she was the city he had longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeless wanderer , the city of the wretched , futile people living in the rooms of little cheap hotels , the city of the lost boy and the stranger looking at a million lights , the terrible , lonely , empty city of no doors , and of the homeless , thronging ways . Hers was the city of the native , and now it seemed to him that he was " in . " She was the city 's daughter just as he had been the product of the town . The city 's ways were not strange ways to her , nor were its crowded highways lonely ones , nor were its tongues and faces to her hard and cold and new . Rather , the city was the familiar neighborhoodP391of her whole life  --  the yard in which she played when she was young , the place where she had gone to school , the " different parts of town " where she had lived , grown up , been married , moved to  --  and all of it was a province as warm , as friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little town . The woman really loved the city . She loved it not with ostentatious show , self-consciously ; nor coldly , like feeble people who show off an old house which their ancestors built and , unable to make a real life in the world they have , trump up a false one of the world which they have lost . No , for Mrs. Jack the city was her living tenement ; it was her field , her pasture , and her farm ; and she loved it so because she was herself so much a part of it , because she knew and understood it so , because it was the stage and setting of her own life and work . For her , the city was a living , breathing , struggling , hoping , fearing , hating , loving , and desiring universe of life . It was the most human place on earth because it had in it the most " humanity , " the most American because it had in it the most Americans . All the grandeur and the misery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble work and the ignoble strivings for mean ends ; the terror , violence , and brute corruption , and the innocence , the hope , the dreaming , and the loveliness ; the huge accomplishment and a constant , raw unfinishof things still doing , never ended , getting done  --  all of it was here , and so to her she city was America . And in all of this , of course , because this vision and this understanding was so healthy , sound , and true , Mrs. Jack was right . She carried this sense of health , of life , of work , of human understandingwith her everywhere she went ; it radiated from her like a strong and sweet vitality of happiness . It was as if , Antaeuslike , Mrs. Jack derived her own strength , her own health , her own energy of work , of wanting , and of business , that radiated from her rosy face , that was legible in every movement of her energetic figure , that was described in every small , brisk step , in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and body of her native earth  --  which was that swarming and immortal rock on which she trod . She brought this grand exhilaration of the city 's life to all the meetingsthat she had with him . There on the parapets of furious noon , upon these mounting pinnacles of day , these two would meet , and instantly for him it would be as if the huge , sweet cargo of the morninghad been borne in upon him too . A dozen tales of life and business would form upon the lips of this excited voyager , and suddenly it would seem to him that a vast and moving pageantry , the whole imperial chronicle of day , was there . She had been " here and there " about the town . At nine o'clock she had been at work among the tailors in the garment district , where she was employed two mornings in the week to make designs . Even as she spoke , the whole scene spread before his eyes  --  the enormous buildingsof the district , the huge " lofts , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloth , the coarse , clean smell of wool , the fittingrooms , and cutting rooms , with the tailors sitting cross-legged on the tables . " In all your life you 've never seen such skill as these men have ! The way they use their hands ! It 's all so swift , so sure , so delicate  --  it 's  --  somehowit makes you think of some great orchestra !  --  But God ! " suddenly her shoulders shook , her face turned crimson  --  " The way it smells ! Sometimes I have to hang my neck out of the window ! " At half-past ten she had been to the costume fitter 's . Here was the world backstage again , the life of the performers : " I got Mary Morgan fitted up . She 's going to look lovely . The poor kid ! " Suddenly her face was earnest and indignant , full of pity and concern : " She has been out of a job for almost a year . This is the first work that she has had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came in . She pulled me by the arm and got me off into a corner and told me her underwear was simply in rags . She said , I simply ca n't let these people see me as I am , I 'll drop dead if they do . What am I going to do ? ' The poor kid was almost crying . I gave her some money and told her to go out and buy herself some decent things . Honestly ! if somebody had handed her the moon upon a silver platter she could n't have been half so happy ! She threw her arms around me and hugged me , and said , When you die and go to heaven they 'll have to turn the Holy Mother out and give you the best room in the house . ' She 's a Catholic , " said Mrs. Jack and laughed , but then her face grew earnest in its indignation , and she said : " Well , is n't it a shame ! A kid like that pounding pavements for eight months until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of rags ! And God knows what she has lived on , how she has kept from starving ! And then rehearsing her three weeks without a cent of pay ! And if the show is a flop , she gets nothingand is out upon the street again , looking for a job ! . . . But gee ! You should have seen her when we fitted her ! She was lovely ! There 's a girl for you , young fellow ! " cried Mrs. Jack , with twinkling eyes .   " You should have seen her this morning when she got that dress on ! She would have knocked your eye out ! She 's got the most beautiful arms and shoulders I have ever seen . She 's playing the part of a society girl in this play --  " A society girl ! " " Yes . " She paused for a moment , not understanding the implication of surprise . Then as it came to her , she looked at him , her shoulders began to shake hysterically again , and she cried : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The poor kid with no soles in her shoes and her underwear in rags playing the part of Marcia Coventry ! " " What did the dress cost  --  do you know ? " " Yes , " again her face was serious and concerned , full of business , " I got the estimates this morning . I 've tried to keep it down as much as possible  --  do n't believe anybody else could have done half so well . If I had taken her to Edith 's , I could n't have touched it under five hundreddollars . But I 've kept it down to just under three hundred , doing it this way . And it 's a knock-out ! I 'll bet every little junior Leaguer in the world will copy it this Winter . " " You 've done a lot of work on it , have n't you ? " " You 've simply no idea ! " cried Mrs. Jack , looking very earnest . " The work I 've done on this kid 's clothes alone ! She 's a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damnedest tripe ! " she said quite simply . Her face flushed , and her shoulders shook again with laughter : " We 've got a name for it among ourselves . We call it  --  The Fall Showing . " " What is it ? " " Oh , it 's a lot of junk someone has thrown together for that fellow Croswell . " " Cecil Croswell ? " " Yes , you know  --  the Lady Killer . In all your life  --  you 've no idea "  --  she went on with an air of incredulity  --  " it 's simply past belief ! " " What ? " " What these people  --  these actors  --  are like . They know simply nothing of what 's going on  --  outside . If you spoke to that fellow about Mussolini , he 'd ask you what did he ever play in . That 's about as much as he knows about anything , " she said in a tone of disgust . " And of all the nerve ! Of all the conceit ! If you knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrieked hysterically  --  " God ! This morning  --  " she began , and could not go on. 394 THE WEB AND THE ROCK " What happened this morning ? " " When he came for his fitting  --  " said Mrs. Jack . " He wears evening clothes all through the play  --  that 's the kind of play it is . Well , I 've designed a beautiful suit for him and he put it on . And then , " Mrs. Jack had a hysterical lilt in her voice , " he would strut back and forth before the mirror , to and fro and up and down , wiggling his shoulders , and fooling with his collar , and giving it a tug here and a tweak there , until he almost drove me out of my mind . And then he began to hem and to haw , and , well , you see it was this way , and , well , you see it was that way , and the upshot of it , " she cried indignantly , " was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed was good enough for him . The nerve of him ! I could 've killed him ! Well , he cleared his throat and began to orate  --  you 'd have thought he was doing East Lynn in a road show . On the whole , ' says he , I think I like my own suit better : He 's got a fancy suit of evening clothes that he loves so much he wears it down to breakfast . Well , Mr. Croswell , ' I said , all I can say is that this is a suit that fits the part and the one you ought to wear . ' Yes , ' says he , but the lapels , ' he says  --  the lapels '  --  he cries out in his tragic tone  --  the lapels , dear lady , are not right '  --  with that he lets his voice drop down as if he was announcing the death of a child . The nerve of that guy ! " she muttered angrily . " I knew more about lapels when I was six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he says , drawing himself up and tweaking at them with his fingers , as if he was addressing Parliament , The lapels are too narrow ! '  --  Theones he has , of course , on that fancy rig of his , are broad enough to drive a team of horses over . Well , Mr. Croswell , ' I said , all I can say is that the lapels may not be right for Croswell but they are right for the part he is playing and Croswell is not playing Croswell , but the part that has been written for him in the play '  --  which is a big lie , of course , " she said disgustedly  --  " Croswell is playing Croswell  --  that'sall he can play , all he ever played ! Of course , he could n't see this  --  these people have no quality ! " she cried impatiently , in a kind of parenthesis . " You 've simply no idea ! You would n't believe that it was possible ! The fool kept talking of his points . ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were speaking to a child , I know . Still , all of us have our own points . And as for me  --  ' he cried , slapping himself on the chest like a big piece of ham "  --  and with these words , Mrs. Jack , her eyes dancing and her face rosy with laughter , suited the action to the words and slapped herself on the breast with her small hand  --  " ' As for me , ' P395he cried "  --  she uttered the words in a tone of sonorous burlesque  --  " ' As for me , I am noted for muh torso ! " ' She shook hysterically , with a last shriek faintly : " Can you beat it ? Does it seem possible ? Now , that will just give you an idea of what some of them are like ! " " And what else have you been doing ? Is that all ? " " Oh , heavens no ! I put in a full day 's work before I met you here today . First , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katy came in with coffee at seven-thirty . Then I bathed and took a cold shower . I take it so cold that it sends tingles all up and down my spine . " And , indeed , her face always had that glowing freshness as if she had just come from a cold shower . " I dressed and had my breakfast , talked to Cook , told her what to order , and how many were coming to the house tonight . I talked to Barney  --  he 's our driver  --  and told him where to come for me this afternoon . Then I read the mail and paid some bills and wrote some letters . I talked to Roberta on the phone about this new show I 'm doing for the League . I saw Fritz for a moment , as he was leaving for the office . I looked in and talked to Edith for a moment in her room . And I was out of the house and on my way downtown before nine o'clock . Then I was at work at Stein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for costume fittings until twelve  --  then to the wig maker 's on 47th Street at twelve-fifteen  --  " she laughed : " The strangest thing happened ! You know where the wig maker 's is  --  it 's in what used to be an old brownstone house , and you go up a flight of steps and there is a big front window on the first floor with wigs and hats in it . Well ! " she exclaimed with accented and excited finality . " What do you suppose I did ? I went up the stairs and thought that I was right , and saw a door and opened it , and just walked in . And what do you suppose I found ? I walked right in upon a bar . It seemed to run the whole way back , and a whole lot of men were standing at the bar drinking , and there was a man behind the bar mixing drinks . Well ! " she cried again , " I was so surprised ! Honestly , it was the strangest thing . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth wide open staring at them . And they were all so jolly . The man behind the bar called out : Come right on in , lady . There 's always room for one more . ' Well , I was so confused  --  I just did n't know what to say , and at last I said , I thought this was the wig maker 's ! ' Well , you should have heard them laugh ! The bartender said , No , lady , this ai n't the wig maker 's , but we 've got some hair tonic here that 'll grow hair better than a wig ! ' And another man said , You 're in the wrong plat396 THE WEB AND THE ROCKThis ai n't the wig maker 's , it 's the Novelty Shop '  --  and then they all laughed again ; I guess , because the place had a kind of fake window with some dirty old Christmas bells , and a few strips of red crepe paper in it , and a sign that said , United Novelties Supply Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the reason they laughed . They seemed awfully jolly . The bartender came out from behind the bar and took me to the door , and showed me where the wig maker 's was , which was just next door , and the reason I had got confused was that there are two flights of steps and I was in a hurry and was n't looking , and so I got mixed up  --  but is n't New York wonderful ! " She had delivered all of this in a tone of excited and almost breathlessrapidity , but seemed to translate the confusion of the moment perfectlyin her own breathless and bewildered face . " After that , " she went on , " I had to go and rummage through some old furniture shops up on Eighth Avenue . You simply have no idea the kind of junk that you can find . It 's fascinating just to poke around . I was looking for somethings that would go into a setting for a room in a Victorian house in the Seventies . I found some marvelous things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of lithograph , I guess , showing a lady with blonde hair playing a spinet , and a gentleman , with ruffles at the neck and lacy sleeves , leaning on the spinet with a gloomy look , and three little gold-haired children , all with high waists and ruffled sleeves and long skirts like the lady had , waltzing around in a sort of dance , and marble flags upon the floor and a tiger skin  --  it could n't have been more perfect for the kind of room I have in mind . I found some window hangings and some drapes of the kind that I was looking for  --  of an awful , faded , greeny plush  --  God ! they looked as if all the germs and dust and microbes in the world had nested there  --  but they were just the things I wanted . And I would ask for other things as well , which it did n't seem that any living , breathing , mortal man could possibly have  --  and the old fellow would go poking and rummaging around in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking for ! ... Look ! " She took out a tiny folded scrap of tinfoil wrapping paper , and she spread it out for him : it had a winy , brilliant , and exotic color , and she said , " Do n't you think that 's beautiful ? " " What is it ? " " It 's the wrapping off a piece of candy . I saw it this morning as I was passing by a little stationery shop . The color was so strange andp397beautiful that I went in and bought the candy , just to get this wrapping here . If I can , I 'm going to see if I can match it somewhere with a piece of cloth  --  I 've never seen this shade before , it would be beautiful . " She was silent for a moment , then continued : " God ! I wish I could tell you everything I 've seen today . I am bursting with it , I want to bring it all to you , and give it to you , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was a little girl , I was fascinated by all the different shapes of things , by all the beautiful designs there are . I would go and get all different kinds of leaves : the shape and form of each one was so different , and so delicate , so beautiful , I would draw all the different kinds of leaves , with all the delicate little lines and forms they had in them . Sometimes the other kids laughed at me for doing it , but it was like having found a new and wonderful world that is all around us , and that most people never see . And it keeps getting richer and more beautiful all the time . I see things every day now that I never saw before  --  things that people pass by all the time without ever seeing .

And here , too , she would be flushed with happy energy , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now the world she brought to him was no longer the world of morning work and business ; it was the great world of the night , a golden world of pleasure , wealth , distinction , talent , and success . She was charged with it , still bubbling over with the bright champagne of all its heady gaiety , still sparkling with its brilliance and its joy . This night world in which she moved and lived as a familiar and acknowledged denizen was a privileged world of high distinction . It included illustrious names and celebrated personalities that had long been famous through the length and breadth of the whole nation . It included great producers and famous actresses , well-known writers , painters , journalists , and music ns , and mighty financiers .

She brought it to him with a casual touch of her own familiarity with it , and what was most incredible was the knowledge that she was herself a part of it . God knows what he had expected to discover  --  to hear these creaturesfeasted on ambrosia , drank nectar from a golden cup , ate lampreys or strange foods the average man had never heard about . But it was somehow astounding to hear that this famous company went to bed , got up , and bathed and dressed , and ate and went about its business much the same as other people did , and that from the portals of these celebrated lips fell passages of speech not wholly different from his own . The celebrated columnist whose winged jest , whose subtle wit , whose jabs and praises , whose graceful lyrics , and whose clever limericks had flashed forth for more than twenty years  --  this man whose daily chronicle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own college years , reading into that diary of the day 's activity the whole glamorous pageantry of that distant Babylon , cloud-capped and rosy-hued there in the smoke of his imagination  --  this Aladdinlike enchanter who had so often rubbed his lamp and brought the magic of great Babylon to life for a hundred thousand boys like him  --  this magician alive and breathing in the flesh had been a guest at dinner on this very evening , had sat next to her , and talked to her , called her by her first name , as she called his , and would record that very date and day , the place , the person , and the time , in another portion of that endless diary , which other visionary youths in a thousand other little towns would read and feast upon , dreaming forever of great Babylon : " So , out and in a petrol waggon to Esther jack 's , and found a merry company , and S.

" Or she would bring to him the merry tidings of some glittering first night , some opening of a famous theatre , and the company of the famous and the beautiful who were there . The brilliant process of these happenings would babble from her lips with the gay , excited humor of a child . And , as if to give the whole thing naturalness  --  perhaps to put him more at ease , to make him feel that he , too , was a member of this favored group , himself initiate to all its privilege ; or perhaps , just with a shade of affectation , to show she was herself of such a clear and simple spirit as not to be impressed or overawed byP399the resounding reputations of the great  --  she would preface her descriptions , qualify her golden calendar of names , with such modest phrases as " a man named  --  .

" Or : " I was seated tonight at dinner next to a man named Ernest Ross , " mentioning a famous criminal lawyer . " His wife and I used to go to school together . " Or : " I wonder if you have ever heard of a man named Stephen Hook ? " This was a writer who enjoyed a wide reputation as a critic and biographer . " Well , he was up to our house for dinner tonight , and I was telling him about you . He would like to meet you . He 's one of the finest people I have ever known . I 've known him for years .

" Well , he was there tonight , and he came up to me after the show and guess what he said ! " With her eyes sparkling and her face flushed with laughter and happiness , she looked at him a moment , then said : " He told me that I was the best designer in America . That 's what he said ! " Or : " I wonder if you ever heard of a woman by the name of Roberta Jeilrrinn ? " This was the director of a famous art theatre . " Well , she came to dinner tonight . We are very old friends , " said Mrs. Jack . " We .  --  grew up together .

Mrs. Jack sometimes gleefully asserted that she was like her unclep40Ibodies were magnificent , the action of the black against the white so quick and swift , like a kind of dance . " Later on , she told him , after the fight was over , the guests had scattered around the gaming tables , and Bergerman had lost a million francs at roulette in less than twenty minutes , or , at the rate of exchange that then existed , almost thirty thousand dollars . " And it meant absolutely nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man with a flushed and very earnest face . " Can you imagine it ? Is n't it incredible ? " And for a moment more she continued to look at him with a surprised and questioning kind of face , as if he , perhaps , might be able to supply the answer . She had other stories of this kind  --  stories of men who won or lost fortunes at gambling every evening and who were not troubled , either with their losses or their gains ; stories of women and young girls who came into Mr. Rosen 's shop and within fifteen minutes spent more money for clothing than most people hoped to possess in a whole lifetime ; of a famous courtesan who walked in with her elderly lover and bought a Chinchilla coat " right oft the rack , " paying for it in spot t ash , taking from her purse a wad of thousand-dollar bills , " big enoughi , " said Mrs. Jack , " to choke a horse , " and tossing sixty of them out across the counter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of wealth that was at first fabulous and fascinating in its Bagdadlike enchantments , hut that quickly took on a more sinister hue as Monk read the meaning of its social implications . It shone there , written on the face of night , like a lurid and corrupted sneer . It was a world that seemed to have gone insane with its own excess , a world of criminal privilege that flouted itself with an inhuman arrogance in the very face of a great city where half the population lived in filth and squalor , and where two-thirds were still so bitterly uncertain of their daily living that they hail to thrust , to snarl , to curse , to cheat , contrive , and get the letter of their fellows like a race of mongrel dogs .

Meanwhile , these blind men lived in filth and went through a daily struggle just to get the barest means of life , and they swallowed down obediently all the vicious nonsense that any politician told them about the " high standard " of their living which , these wretches were solemnly assured , made them " the envy of the world . " And yet , although they were blind , surely they could smell . But they were so infatuated that they reveled in the general all-pervasive stink of rottenness . The blind men knew that government was rotten , that almost every branch of authority , from high office down to the lowest constable that patrolled the beat , was riddled through and through , like a putrescent honeycomb , with dishonesty and graft . And yet the most obscure of all the land , the smallest cipher in the subway 's depths , could assure you that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things had always been , the way they would continue to the end of time .

" And if one protested at the process over much , it was a sign the man was " sore "  --  " You 'd do the same thing if you were in his place  --  sure you would ! " One 's virtue , therefore , was only another name for one 's envious chagrin . And if one was virtuous , did one think because he was that there would be no more cakes and ale  --  or , for that matter , chickens in the pot , or two cars in garages , or , to step it up a peg or two , Chinchillacoats from Mr. Rosen 's , or roulette wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  the blind assured each other as they struggled through the stiles  --  that had made them all " the envy of the world " ? The knowledge that she was a part of this life , too , went through him like a flash , and he would feel again the baffling torture of thatp403which in the years to come was to torment and trouble him sothe enigma of this flower face . How could she be a part of it ? creature seemed to him so full of health and happiness , so full of , of hope , of morning , and of high integrity . And yet , indubitably , was a part of this thing , too  --  of this Midas world of night , of this Ilan wink , its criminal corruption and inhuman privilege , the i arrogance of its living sneer. d here , too , at night , she could blossom like a flower , a flower that the look at night , even as it had by day , of innocence and mornandthat could live here , breathe here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she blossomed in the day , and be a part of it , never lost an atom of her freshness and her beauty  --  a flower that nncd from a hill of dung. e could not fathom it , it whipped his spirit to a frenzy , it made turn on her at times and rend her , bitterly accuse her with unjust cruel words  --  and leave him baffled and infuriated at the end , no rcr to the truth than he had ever been . And the truth was simply that she was a woman , and that her way , e everyone 's , had been a vexed and most uncertain one , and that , e everyone in that great honeycomb , she , too , was caught up in a h , and had come to these concessions in the end .

On one side was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it demanded , the obligations it entailed . And n the other side there was the world of work , and of creating , the rld of friendship , aspirations , and the heart 's true faith . And thise was the deeper , truer part of Mrs. Jack . It was as worker and as doer that this woman was supreme . Thee religion of her soul , the thing that saved her and restored her m the degradation of the wasteful idleness , the insane excess of selfadornment , the vanity of self-love , and the empty ruin of hollowness at most women of her class had come to know , was the religion of r work . It saved her , took her out of herself , united her life to aNobler image , which was external to her and superior to the vanities ofSelf . There was no labor too great , no expenditure of time and careand patient effort too arduous and too exacting , if , through it , sheCould only achieve " a good piece of work . " And of all the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of work . To her this was original sin . She could overlook the faults and errors of a human personality , excuse its weaknesses , tolerate its vices , and the flaws it could not help . But she could not , would not , stand for shoddy work , for there was no excuse for it . An ill-cooked meal , an ill-kept room , an ill-made dress , an ill-painted piece of scenery , meant something more to her than haste or carelessness , something more than mere forgetfulness . They meant a lack of faith , a lack of truth , a lack of honesty , a lack of all integrity  --  a lack of everything " without which , " as she said , " your life is nothing . " And that is what saved her in the end . She held steadfast to the faith of honest work . This was her real religion , and from it all the good things in her life and person came .

The truth was , once a thing had touched interest he fastened to it like a hound , his hunger for it insatiable , oils , devouring , and consuming , and it drove him on until hethe end . It had always been that way with him. a child , hearing Aunt Maw speak about the Civil War , and of the the men came marching back , suddenly for the first time in his **27;5652;TOOLONG stifling , he tore the mask from his face , and took a long stride toward Trevelyan , and thrust out his head and called , ' Trevelyan ! ' The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed hit was you . ' Trevelyan ! ' Mr. Munn thought how sick , how afraid , how stifled , those men were under their masks . He gulped a full , deep , exquisite breath , like a man who rises from a long dive , and with burning lungs and bursting heart plunges , chest-high , into air . And you , Trevelyan '  --  and he took another stride  --  you killed that man , you did ; answer me ! ' He was almost upon him . Trevelyan moved , lifted his arm . The pistol exploded in Mr. Munn 's grasp . He swung back from Trevelyan , seeing , even in that light , the man 's narrow eyes go suddenly wide . Like a belated echo , another shot was fired . Who fired it , Mr. Munn did nut know . " Trevelyan staggered , and crossed his hands on his chest with a movement that was sad , almost womanly , humble . Then , there came the volley . Trevelyan sagged , then fell backward over the lip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing there in the little space before the men . Even the grass did not look trodden . It was as though nothing had been there . The smell of gun smoke hung on the air , sharp and cleanly like the smell of a disinfectant .

Somebody oughter look , ' a man hazarded.  |p20IMr  . Munn tried to say , I ' 11 do it . ' But he could not . One of the men approached the rim , somehow as with an air of stealth , and peered down . He returned to the group . Then he said , He 's in the water . ' Somebody remarked : It 's deep there . On this side . ' Another man walked to the rim and looked over . When he came back , he said nothing . The men got on their horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lighter now , the clouds almost gone . The legs of the horses made a swishing , silken sound in the dew-damp weeds and grass ; the saddles creaked a little ; insects gave their small night noises , familiarly . My shot , Mr. Munn thought , my shot , did it hit him ? One of the men removed the cloth that had masked his face , and stuck it into a side pocket with the easy gesture of a man who crams his handkerchief into his pocket . Mr. Munn looked at the man 's face . The other men took off their masks . Mr. Munn looked at them . Their shadowy faces were remarkable to him , the same faces , but remarkable . They were like faces a man finds on returning to the scenes of his youth , the same faces , recognizable still , but only in their astounding and reproachful difference . Along the overgrown track the riders strung out in single file , Mr. Munn in front . He seemed to feel the eyes of all of them fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a physical pressure . He had the impulse to plunge his heels into the mare 's flanks and break into a gallop up the long dark corridor between the trees , to leave them all behind , staring ; but he mastered it . Then he tried , as with the discovery of caution and cunning , not to hear the subdued sounds of their motion . He fixed his own gaze on the point , far ahead , where the dark forms of the two rows of trees converged against the sky , trying to draw the awareness of the men out of himself and delude his senses into the absolute emptiness , the loneliness , which he thought he must have.  |p202My  shot , he thought , did it hit him ? But the thought only flickered at the edge of his consciousness , like something caught out of the tail of the eye , and he put it from him , discovering , complacently and craftily , how easy , how unexpectedly easy , it was to do so if he focused all his powers upon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not important , not really . He experienced a sense of release , of pleasure , at the discovery of its unimportance . The only thing important now was to fix his eyes upon that point , yonder , far up the track , and keep them fixed there . That was important . A short distance before the pike , after the weed-grown track had given way to the road , Mr. Munn pulled his mare to the side , and let the men come even with him . Good night , ' he said , his voice having , to his own ears , a barren and croaking sound as though made by some artificial contrivance . I thought you might spend the night at my place , ' Mr. Wyngard suggested . No , ' Mr. Munn answered shortly . I can cut through here to my road . ' The men moved off and away from him . He watched them move away , their definite forms disintegrating into the uncertainshadows ; and though solitude had , the minute before , seemed so beckoning , so desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair , now that those forms were moving away from him . He rode at a trot , giving himself as completely as possible to the rhythm of the motion , the easy , lulling sounds of hoofs and leather , the anonymous , familiar closeness of the shadowed landscape . Those items belonged wholly to the moment in which he existed , a moment without affiliations with the past or the future . He tried to sink into that moment , trying to escape from time by surrendering most completely to time . He felt like a man who , in the ease of a dream , walks a wire across space , surprised that what had in waking reality seemed sop203impossible is so easy , but at the same time still aware that with a single misstep , a single failure in balance , he will go hurtling down to one side or the other . The immediate , ignorant moment was like that wire to him . But while he moved forward , surrendering himself to the moment , complacent and surprised that it was so easy , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grew increasingly aware of what was , apparently , a purely physical discomfort . He felt like a man who thinks himself recovered from an illness , and goes about his normal affairs to find , unexpectedly , that the sickness is still there in his bones and vitals . It is not because of it , he thought , because of what happened . His mind automaticallyrefused the statement of what had happened ; the fact itself was denied in namelessness . But the discomfort increased . The knowledge which his mind denied rose in his bowels . I 'm sick , he thought , it 's just that I 'm a little sick . The nausea rose in him like sediment in a disturbed vessel . Finally , he slipped from the saddle and vomited on the grass by the road . Heticlung to the stirrup leather , supporting himself , until his strength returned . When he came to the branch that ran across the road , under a little plank bridge , he again dismounted . Trees grew thickly there , along the water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sank his hands and wrists into the cool water , wetting his sleeves . From his cupped hands he supped up the water and rinsed his mouth , and then drank . Then , leaning over the surface and holding his face close , he bathed his face in the water and pressed the coldness of his hands against his eyes . Feeling the water on his face , he thought suddenly of Trevelyan 's face in the water . In the water of the quarry . The man had said , in the water . He rose quickly , clumsy with haste , and stared at the water before him . It was black under the trees . A man would lie in the water and the water would be over him and inside of him and he would becomep204a part of the water . The water which he had just drunk so avidly felt cold and inimical within him . Again he had the impulse to vomit , but controlled himself . He struck his hands together violently , the fist of one into the palm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the God-damned fool ; the poor God-damned fool ! ' He felt better then , and rode on . The whole matter almost seemed then , on the moment , like something known for a long time . He would fix his gaze , as before , upon some distant point and bend every energy upon it , so that he seemed to be drawn out of himself . And so powerfully could he distract himself in this exercise that , as he rode up the drive toward his own house and saw a faint light in one of the windows downstairs , no question crossed his mind . He saw the light , and accepted it ; that was all . He went directly to the stable , and unsaddled the mare . Then , having the key to the front and not to the side door , he returned across the yard , under the maples . A few prematurely fallen leaves rustled beneath his tread . Not until he had pushed open the door and stood on the threshold , the key still in his hand , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling faintly into the hall from the half-open door of the room at the left , really take hold upon him . He had told May that lie might not come back until very late , or perhaps not at all , and that she should get Rosie to sleep up at the house . He drew the door softly shut behind him . Terse , ' he heard his own name pronounced . It was May 's voice . He stood stock-still , with his hand still on the knob of the door behind him . Then she came into the hall . Her small figure was outlined against that dim light from the room behind her . Perse , ' she repeated . He tried to speak to her , but the words would not come , his throat was so dry and constricted.  |p205Perse  , what 's the matter ? ' she demanded , her voice rising and her gaze unwaveringly fixed upon him . Nothing , ' he managed to say , and took a step toward her . But Perse Staring at her , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Perse , there is . ' She retreated before him , her eyes still fixed on his face . She pushed the door fully open behind her , not turning to look , and stepped back across the threshold into the room . He came close to her , and she took another step back , pronouncing his name and lifting one hand a little in an indeterminate gesture . The lamp on the table in the middle of the room was turned down so low that the flame flickered weakly along the wick and the shadows swam unsteadily , encroachingly , in the corners and over the floor . What little light there was , the woman 's blonde hair caught . It was loose over her shoulders . She was wearing a blue kimono . It seemed too large for her . When she lifted her arm , the looped and flowing sleeve emphasized its fragility and the aimlessness of the gesture . Oh , Perse ! ' she exclaimed . I ca n't stand it . What 's the matter , Perse ? ' Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never tell me , ' she said weakly and lamentingly , her arm rising in that gesture and then subsiding . Not anything . ' He reached out as if to pluck at the flowing garment . But she stood too far away from him . It 's so late ; you stayed out so late . ' And then : You 've been drinking , Perse . You 've had whisky . ' No , ' he denied . What 's the matter ? Oh , Perse ! ' God damn it ! ' he uttered , and stepped quickly to her and seized her by the shoulders . You 're hurting -- p206Well , ' he said . He drew her to him , more tightly . Then he began to kiss her on the face . Do n't , Perse , do n't ! Do n't ; I want to talk to you . ' He continued to hold her . Then he began to force her back , beyond the table . No , no ! ' she exclaimed , and a tone of desperation came into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Not now . ' He paid no attention to her . No . Later , maybe later --  ' She tried to thrust him back , and mixed with the tone of desperation there was a hint of wheedling , guileful but hopeless . After he had forced her past the table to the divan , she struggled with him with a strength which he had never suspected . Then , suddenly , she was as passive as a dead body , although her hands remained crushed against his chest as in resistance and revulsion.  |p207THE  first fields were cut . Men moved slowly , stoopingly , across the wide fields . They bent between the heavy plants , and lifted the heavy blade of the cutting knife and slashed off the stalk at the base , to leave the stob protruding from the hill . In the open places , where the tobacco had been cut , the wagons waited , and the mules drooped their long , bony , spatulate , patient heads . The fall sharpened early . The first curing fires in the loaded barns had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like haze over the bare fields in the late , level light . Everywherethere was the thin and pervasive odor of burning , which , mingled with the other , more natural odors of the season , the dry , pungent , leathery odors of earth and withering vegetation , fed the sense of recession and finality . In the afternoons great flocks of grackles , gathering in their autumnal multitudes , would wheel over the fields . When they flew low enough , their burnished blackness would glisten in the light , and the air would be full of the vigorous whisper of their wing-beats . When they settled in the trees along a lane , or in the woods bordering the fields , or in the groves about the houses , their cries would be incessant . Mr. Munn , ever since he had grown up , would see the great flocks of grackles , on bright days in the fall , sweeping across the blue sky , from horizon to horizon , or fountaining upward and outward from a tree or a grove where they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide expanse of a field , like bright , black seeds flung from a sower 's liberal hand ; and almost always , if the press of his immediatep208occupation was not too strong , he would let his gaze follow their flight . He would observe the sweep of the flock on the sky , the swaying but sure convolutions of the wide-flung mass like the curved and reaching and self-fulfilling forward thrust of a breaker , or the movement of a field of grain in the wind . That spectacle always spoke to him of an inevitability , a surety , a completeness beyond his grasp or , even , definition . That perfection , that victorious indifference , filled him with a loneliness which mingled insidiously with the minute tightening of his muscles and the new tingling of the blood , like a start of hope , which the sight had provoked . During those years spent in Philadelphia , when he was studying law , that feeling had come to him merely as a momentarytouch of homesickness . One clear afternoon , as he walked down a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grackles came sweeping over the roofs , not flying very high , and settled in the trees of a little park just ahead . He stopped stock-still , one hand on the iron fence in front of a narrow dooryard . Then , slowly , he walked on down the street , toward the little park where the grin Ides were . In the overmasteringloneliness of that moment , his whole life seemed to him nothing but vanity . His past seemed as valueless and as unstable as a puff of smoke , and his future meaningless , unless  --  and the thought was a flash , quickly dissipated  --  he might by some unnamable , single , heroic stroke discover the unifying fulfillment . He was on his way , that afternoon , to see a relative , a distant cousin who had once known his mother and with whom his mother had maintained for years a desultory and unreasonable correspondence . Miss Sprague  --  your cousin lanthe , ' his mother called her  --  and his mother had met only once , at a small summer resort in south-central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks there one summer when she was a young girl , and Miss Ianthe Sprague , some tenp209or twelve years her senior , almost old enough at that time to be considered an old maid , had come with an aunt to stay at the Thermopolis Hotel . They had spent several weeks together at Thermopolis Springs , and though they never saw each other again , they wrote letters . Mr. Munn had wondered before he went to Philadelphia , and wondered even more after he went , what events of that summer at Thermopolis Springs could have fixed the two women together in their meaningless , but apparentlystable , bond . He could imagine , well enough , how their time had been spent , sipping the water from the spring , sitting together and talking on the long , shady veranda of some white , wooden hotel , watching the men play bowls , or dancing in the pavilion . But his mother had once remarked that Ianthe Sprague had always been in bad health , no better than an invalid , and had practically been confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the dancers for a while before being carried up to bed . He had seen some of the letters which the two women exchanged . The letters exhibited no trace of intimacy . In their letters the women never referred to that little fragment of the past which they had shared , except , perhaps , by way of giving an account of some person whom both had known . The letters were brief and bare recitals of commonplace facts . Miss Sprague would write of the weather in Philadelphia , of the price of coal , of the repairing of a house in her block ; never of anything different from those topics . But in his childhood and early adolescence , Percy Munn , even though he was well acquainted with the letters , found that the name Ianthe ' raised in his mind an image of great delicacy and beauty . In one of his father 's books he read a poem with the title Ianthe ' : From you , Ianthe , little troubles pass Like little ripples down a sunny river ; Your pleasures spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again as blithe as ever . It seemed to verify his imaginings.  |p210In  Philadelphia he found Miss Sprague , now almost totally blind , sitting in a high-ceilinged , dingy , overheated room , in which the unmoving air held the odor of camphor . On the walls and on the tables and on the what-not , dozens of photographshung askew or were propped at slovenly angles . The woman , who actually could not have been much more than fifty years old , looked seventy . She was lean to emaciation , and the skin hung in dry , gray folds and pouches from her neck and jawbone . Her hands shook as with perpetual cold . She leaned peeringly forward when she spoke in her outworn voice . About her shoulders a black shawl was wrapped , and on the front of her lusterless , black-silk dress there were spots which had been left , apparently , by spilled food . Miss Sprague lived in her own house , but on the upper floor . There , on the second floor , she would be . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Miss Sprague turn her head , with a careful and creaking motion , and peer toward him . How arc you feeling , Cousin Ianthe ? ' the would say . Not much worse , ' she would answer , except for the weather . ' Or : Maybe a little better , thank you , but I do n't know . Is it getting any colder , outsider ' When he first began to come to see her , he tried to lead her into talking of his mother , and of herself . The sight of her , at first , stirred to a kind of painful and reproachful life those boyhoodnotions that had clustered about her name . He had completelyforgotten those notions . Now , the sight of her revived them , and shocked them . He was like a man who puts his leg down unexpectedly and feels the twinge of an old wound , or fracture . As in a last , desperate or thrifty , automatic effort to salvage something of his own past being which was inherent in those notions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , that summer a long time back , before his birth , when his mother had been a young girl . But it was no use . She couldp211not do it . She could not , it seemed , because she had really always been as she was now . There was not even any pathos in her present condition , her increasing blindness , her increasing poverty , her illness , her loneliness ; there was none of that pathos of the falling off from youth and beauty and vitality . Rather , her present being was a sort of goal toward which , confidently , she had always been moving . This present being had always been , he was sure , her real being , and now she was merely achieving it in its perfection of negativity and rejection . But once she did say , Your mother was a beautiful young girl . ' When she said that , Percy Munn , who had never before realized , actually , that his mother once had been young , was moved so that tears came to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was ageless , it seemed . A widow , she ran the farm competently , and prayed much . She was taciturn and cold , except for those rare moments when , with a kind of shameless unveiling of the spirit , she tried devouringly and terrifyingly to seize upon her son 's love , or at least to establish some communication with him . At those moments , embarrassed , he could never respond , and so she would turn coldly again upon herself ; and when he , in turn , would try to penetrate to her , her withdrawalwould be complete . When Miss Sprague spoke , he saw his mother as she was now , and , on the instant , as she had been , surely , that summer , young and expectant , poised at the edge of the long hotel veranda , listening to music or watching the men at bowls . He felt that he , almost , could look into her eyes as she stood . In the thought of his mother , there was pathos ; but in Miss Sprague , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reeked of camphor , as in her true medium . This was her triumph . After the second visit , during which the conversation waned to a slow repetition of the details of his train trip , the weather in southern Kentucky , and the furnishings of the room which hep212had rented , he proposed that he should bring something to read aloud to her . She said that she would be grateful . When he asked her what he should bring , she replied , Anything . ' He bought a sentimental novel , feeling certain of his choice . But he had not been reading for ten minutes before he knew that her attention was wandering . She peered at this object in the room , and then at that , and breathed unevenly . He continued to read for an hour or so , and when he left she thanked him . The next week he resumed the novel . But he never finished it . She finally said that what she would like to hear was the newspaper . But when he read the newspaper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , important , consecutive pieces . What she liked was the short , flat statement that had no possible reference to her life , advertisements of merchandise which she could neither buy nor use , the notice of the death of an obscure citizen in a distant part of the city , or of the birth of a child to a couple of whom she had never heard , or of the construction of a building which she would never enter . The novel had a direction , it described lives that were moving toward fulfillments , it pretended to a meaning . Therefore she could not listen to it . She could not listen to the long , consecutive articles in the newspaper . But the fragmentary , the irrelevant , the meaningless , such things she could receive and draw her special nourishment from . Automatically , she rejected everything else ; for , fixed now in her room and failing in vision , she was like some species of marine life that , lodged on the floor or on some rocky shelf ; sustains itself on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ejecting all else , with a delicate and punctilious , but unconscious , discrimination . And she did not like to talk of the past , and avoided his questions . Indeed , she had little memory of the past . That , too , she had rejected , for out of memory rises the notion of a positive and purposive future , the revision of the past . The photographs which cluttered her room and which she never looked at seemedp213to be , paradoxically , the very symbol of her discipline ; they were the trophies of temptations overcome . But Percy Munn persisted for a while , vainly , in his questions and suggestions , even after he had begun to sense the logic of her refusal , and the magnitude of her achievement . All the time he was in Philadelphia he went to see her regularly . He had nothing in common with her , and he was , he knew , nothing more than a meaningless shape to her . There was no charity in his visits , for he knew that she did not desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not make his visits because of that fact ; he knew that she had nothing to say to him and that he had nothing to say to her . Or rather , he did not go to see her because he expected any direct alleviationof his loneliness . His communion with her was like the communionwhich a worshiper may hold with the cold , unhuman , blank , and unbending stone of the carved image . She , too , representedsomething as cold and unrelenting as fate , for she and he had , in however small a proportion , the same blood in their veins . They had a common ancestor , a man whose full name Percy Munn did not know , or had forgotten , and whose bones had lain for a long time now in an obscure crossroads graveyardsomewhere in Virginia . Once he told May about his weekly visits to Miss Sprague . He described the house and the neighborhood , the way the Germans had stared at him in the hall , the very details of Miss Sprague 's room and the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt when he sat there and read the newspaper to her . That was certainly nice of you , Perse , ' May said , patting his arm in approbation , reading to her and all . I 'm sure she appreciatedit . ' She did n't appreciate it a damned bit , ' he asserted . Why , that 's terrible , Perse . She should have , and you doing all that for her . ' I did n't do it for her , ' he said shortly . I reckon I did it forp214myself . ' That was it , for a fact , he thought ; he had done it for himself . He saw that clearly now , so many years later . For yourself ? ' May asked , her tone puzzled . Yes , ' he replied , for myself . ' She did not say anything else . During the weeks when the summer slanted off into fall , he thought rather often about Miss Sprague . She had , for a time , while he built up his law practice and wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered episode of his past . But now that May was gone and he was alone in the house , and in fact so often stayed away from town for days at a time , the recollection of Miss Sprague , and speculations about her , began to occupy a place similar to the place which she had occupied during those years in Philadelphia . The fact , he decided , was not strange , for in those occupationless days and nights , the items of the past which , in the forward drive of his hopes and activities , had seemed to be flashing from him into distance , like objects seen from a moving train , now appeared with an importance and simultaneity that surprised him . And he scanned those items for some explanation , some hint of interpretation , for the present . Then , bailie I , he would try to thrust them from his mind completely . He did not know whether Miss Sprague was alive or dead . Since his mother 's death , he had had but one letter from Miss Sprague . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mother . After some weeks he had received a letter from her saying that she was very sorry that Mrs. Munn was dead and sympathized with him in his bereavement . The letter was curt and detached , almost anonymous . Now , a good many years after the event , he had the impulse to write to Miss Sprague . But he decided against it , for , even as the impulse came , there came the conviction that the letter would not be answered . To answer his letter would be a concession , a weakness , for her . Now she would be , whether alivep215or dead , beyond such concessions ; that letter to him on the occasion of his mother 's death had , he was sure , been the grudging last . Alone much of the time now , standing in the yard or walking across the fields , or sitting on the porch in the evening aware of the new edge to the air , or staring up at the dark above his bed , he occasionally wondered about the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back across time and across the bounds of personality into her special loneliness . He recalledhow , during those periods of loneliness and homesickness in Philadelphia  --  and he had been lonely during all those years  --  he had wondered how anybody could be so alone , so cut off , so withdrawn , as Miss Sprague , and still live . He himself was much alone now , and by choice . Even though he knew that work waited for him at his office , that obligations were , one after another , slipping past the promised date of fulfillment , he could not bring himself to go to town , to meet the men whom he had seen commonly and pleasantly , to say the things which he had so often said before , to sit at the desk where he had sat . He only went in when the pressure of business was so great that it could not be ignored , or when the girl who worked for him telephoned to remind him of an appointment of special importance . The strange thing  --  and the strangeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was almost glad for May 's absence . He had been almost glad that morning after the death of Trevelyan , when he woke up , in the full light of day , to find the house empty except for the negro cook , who silently set the food before him and watched him with a furtive and insolent curiosity . He had waked on the couch in the living-room and had stared at the ceiling while the feelings of unease , loss , and isolationthat filled him , achieved in memory , as a saturated solution settles out its characteristic crystals , the precise structure of fact and chronology.  |p216|p216He  was stiff and cramped from lying on the couch , and his mouth dry as though from drinking . He rose slowly from the couch and walked , with an almost experimental motion , across the carpet to the front windows . There , he flung back the curtains and let the full brilliance of the sunlight strike into the room . That light , falling across the window-sill and spreading over the carpet at his feet to illuminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to deny his recollections . The carpet was prevailingly blue , a dull blue , with a large design of flowers , blue too . But it was so worn and faded that for large tracts the design was lost . At his feet Mr. Munn could see the coarse , brownish cords of the foundation fabric , for the nap at that spot had been trodden almost entirely away . Morning and evening , people had stood here to adjust the curtains , or alone in the room , to stare for a moment out across the yard and beyond the maple trees to the pasture . Fleetingly , Mr. Munn thought of those people , his mother , his father , relatives , servantswhose names and laces he had forgotten , people dead before he was born ; and thought , I am not like any of them . He turned abruptly front the window . he saw , on the marbletoppedtable , the lamp . The bowl was dry , the wick charred down , and the chimney streaked with smoke . He had fallen asleep without blowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , even after ( lawn . May , he learned , had left very early . She had sent the cook down to tell Old Mac to hitch up the buggy and bring it round . Then she had gone away in the buggy , with the old negro man driving . About ten-thirty Mr. Munn , walking in the front yard , had seen the buggy slowly approaching up the drive . He had waited at the gate , but the old negro man , hunched forward over the reins and apparently not seeing him , had gone on past . Mr. Munn had walked back to the stable . Upon his approach , the negro seemed to be entirely engaged in fumbling with a stubbornpiece of harness.  |p2I7Where  did you go ? ' Mr. Munn had demanded . The negro had kept on fumbling with the harness strap . Well , ' Mr. Munn had insisted , answer me . ' I'se gon na answer you , Misser Perse , ' the old man had said , soon ez I kin git shet of this-here . Hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuthen . Now looks lak you 'd say hot weather better'n cold weather . But naw . Here ' t is , hot weather Where did you go ? ' Mr. Munn had asked . Without raising his eyes from the harness strap , the negro man had answered , Over to her folks ' place . ' Her aunt 's place , Miss Burnham 's ? ' The negro man had nodded , still fumbling with the strap . Mr. Munn had turned on his heel and gone back to the house . Two days later , the man from the Burnham place had come , driving Miss Burnham 's surrey , to ask for May 's clothes and things . Mr. Munn had been there at the time . He had stood in the middle of the floor of the big room upstairs while the cook put May 's things into suitcases and boxes . He had thought that that was the time for him to go down and get on his mare and ride over to the Burnham place and talk to May . He had felt sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the pieces of clothes being dropped limply into the boxes , that if he went over there and talked to her she would come back . He had not thought of what words he could say , or of what thoughts and feelings , even , would seek expression in words . Merely , it had occurred to him , if I go talk to her . . . But he had not gone . He had stood in the middle of the floor , as though rooted to the spot , and then the negro man , with a humble and apologetic stoop , had begun to carry the boxes and bags down . Mr. Munn had stood at the window of the bedroom and watched the negro drive off , with the surrey piled high with May 's suitcases and boxes . Then he had looked about the room , moving here and there as though hunting for a mislaid object.  |p218By  evening , however , he felt more composed . His composure had been mysterious to him , as on the night of Trevelyan 's death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty and profound , but dangerous , like a great boulder balanced on the lip of a ravine , but balanced so precariously that , in the end , a breath of wind or the ignorant scurrying of some small ground creature may send it crashing . One night , as he walked in the yard under the maples , three or four negroes passed the yard on the way back to visit one of the cabins . They were laughing and talking as they passed , and he leaned on the top board of the fence and listened to them until they were out of hearing . Then , a little later , he heard singing . They had , apparently , gone to Old Mac 's cabin , and were singing there . He could not make out the words . Suddenly , he visualized them all , sitting in Old Mac 's cabin , where a little fire would be smouldering , although the night was warm enough for the door to be open , sitting there around a smoky lamp , or standing loose-jointedly in the shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes hall-closed . God damn ! ( ; yid damn ! God damn ! ' he repeated , aloud and measuredly in the darkness , and his hands gripped the dry , alien boards of the fence . The whitewash powdered , furrily , against the flesh of his hands . I lc swung on his heel and strode away across the yard . During that period he avoided his accustomed activities around the place . Once or twice , as he went incautiously about some ordinary occupation , the currying of his mare or the inspection of the wood that had been cut for the tobacco-firing , some motion of his own or the sight of some familiar object shook , insidiously and suddenly , his massive composure . Warned , like some convalescent sufferer by the flare-up of an old symptom , he withheld himself , husbanded himself , that nothing should strike him suddenly beyond his strength . So he sank when possible into a blank absorption with the fact ofp219the moment , a leaf on the ground at his feet , a white , unmoving spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a dish , the hum of the flame of a lamp . As he felt the need to protect himself from the disturbing contact of other persons , so more and more he felt the need to protect himself by denying memory , as it were , from the contact of the self he had been . And his mind closed like a valve against all thoughts of the future . Late one afternoon , however , he took down his shotgun and walked across the barn lot and down across the fields back of the house toward the fringe of woods along the creek that watered the farm . When he had reached the brush along the creek and had slipped from sight , he felt relieved and safe . He pushed through the brush , the reddening sumac and buckberry and brittle elder , and entered the open space under the tall shagbark hickories . Their trunks were straight as columns , and unbranching for a long way up . The light filtered goldenly through their unstirring leaves . Yellowish leaves fallen from the hickory boughs lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high overhead and all around him at the walls of leaves that cut him off so privately from the entire world . Then , slowly , he moved across the open space , toward the creek . The ground broke sharply downward toward the creek bank . Here a few sycamores grew , with enormous , white boles from which the umber bark crisped back , and beyond them , willows . The water of the creek had shrunk to leave a gravelly strip shelving off below the level where the willow roots clove to the earth of the bank . Mr. Munn , clutching the willows for support , let himself down off the bank to the little strip of beach . With his gun in readiness , he began to move down the creek . There would be a wider place farther down , he remembered ; there the visible stretch of sky would be wider , and the water would spread out , without current apparently and as smooth as a pond , reflecting the sky and the overhanging trees . In a littlep220while now , the doves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would head for that place , as they always , year after year , had done . They would come over , their sharp , nervouswings beating and their too-small heads outthrust . Their swift forms would look black against the paling , peach-colored sky . They would utter their sweet , breathless , complaining cries . He reached the wider space and stood in an embrasure of the willows . He fixed his eyes on the sky , waiting . A little way upstreamthe water made a soft , riffling murmur as it slid over stones into the stillness of the wider basin . That was the only sound he could distinguish . The first dove came over , high , from the west , and dipped and swung back . It sank , flutteringly , at the edge of the water , downstream . He had had two chances for a shot , when it first swung back and then when it started to flutter down . The gun had been raised , and his finger on the trigger , but he had not fired . Now he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , was prinking at the edge of the water . Then tiie bird rose , and flew off downstream . Ile was a little ashamed and irritated that he had passed up the shot , but , unreasoningly , he had not been able to bring himself to press the trigger . When the next dove came over , he shot it . It came over the trees straight and rather low , and so swiftly that he had opportunity for scarcely more than a snap shot . Even as the explosion first rang in his ears , he saw the clove veer sharply , as though it had struck an invisible wire , and saw three bits of feather floatingfrom the spot where the dove had been , and saw the dove skid sideways in the air , and then , with two or three wild wingbeats , plunge straight down . With the old exaltation big within him , he glanced quickly upward to see if another dove was comingover , and then ran toward the spot where it had fallen . It was stone dead . It lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small bead of blood on its head and another at thep22Ineck . The beak was slightly parted , as when a bird lifts its head after taking a sup of water . Mr. Munn , bending to pick it up , was suddenly seized with revulsion . He straightened up , almost retching . He averted his eyes from the dead bird , and leaning on his gun , as from weakness , stared at the sky . How empty and deep and steadily clear it was ! he thought , and gazed upward . He left the bird where it lay , one wing in the water . Some animal , he thought , would find and devour it . He clambered up the bank , which was steeper here , and moved hurriedly across the strip of woods toward the fields . The sheltered , cut-off chamber of the woods was now , if anything , oppressiveand inimical to him . He pushed his way through the fringe of brush and undergrowth , and found himself , with relief , on the edge of the open fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house , which was concealed in its grove . Something 's the matter with me , ' he said , hurrying . Then : Something 's the matter , I 've got to stop this . ' Two days later he went to the Burnham place to see May . Miss Lucy Burnham , one of the two children of General Sam Burnham , devoted herself to him as long as he lived , and then , after his death , to his memory . Her mother died shortly after the return of the General after the war , leaving the two daughters , according to her last injunction , to look after their father . At the funeral he stood between the two girls , with a hand on the shoulder of each , and the tears streamed from his blue eyes and down into his thick , golden mustaches . The older of the two girls , Lucy , remained his prop and slave , as her mother had been . Sam Burnham , commissioned a brigadier late in the war , was a vain , windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered the war as a politically appointed major , ignorant of even the first principles of his new occupation , but very large and military-looking in his uniform . Though he never distin/were drying in dark patches . On the secretary between the windowswhere the Duchesse had so often given vent to her grievances , her quill hurrying faster than the bird that had once borne it , unfinished letters might still be lying in confusion . There might even now be one beginning : " To Whom it may concern : I hereby recommend Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy for those excellent qualities of mind and character which she has maintainedduring her years of service as governess in my household . . . " Such a letter might have been penned in those last six hours of the Duchesse 's life . But Henriette knew that she would never receive it now . It would never be presented to Madame Le Maire or another possible employer . Some one was unlocking the door . A lamp was being screwed into an iron socket . Once more the woman in charge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot and went through the contents carefully . Henriette recognized her own Paisley shawl and other articles of , her clothing . " Your friends brought them a little while ago , " she was told . " They wanted to see you , but you 're allowed no visitors yet . " Marie Remey must have been to the Rue du Harlay and have collected these few belongings . No one else would have thought of such personal needs , and Henriette blessed her for that . This simple gesture was all that one woman could offer to another . Yet it comforted Henriette a little to handle the familiar lengths of shawl , to set her brush and comb and handkerchiefs on an empty shelf . She was most grateful to Marie for the handkerchiefs . They smelled faintly of vervain from the gardens at Melun . A dried leaf of it still lay between the folded squares . Strange to smell that fragrance in this place , even stranger to be able to smell at all , to recognize a scent when one felt this numbing paralysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers had been last night in the Needle 's Eye ; the room was less stifling . Yet she lay , staring wide-eyed into the darkness , listening to the quietp287all about her , a quiet so intense that as the hours passed she longed for anything to break the unnatural stillness . It was a relief to hear the hours strike or a footstep echo in courtyard or corridor . Here , in the very heart of Paris , it was as if life were suspended . Whether they slept or lay , wakeful as she , those within these walls were no longer part of the city and its activity . Their lives , their loves , their ambitions , their destinies were for the time being entirely out of their keeping . The idea obsessed her as she waited for morning and the first thin graying at the window . She forced herself to take the bread and coffee that was brought her . From the guard who came to take away the tray she begged for permission to read a morning paper , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , easily persuaded to tell her what he could of the murder . The papers were full of it , he said . No one talked of anything else . Every cafe and shop and street corner buzzed with each new detail of horror that leaked out . That first rumor about an assassin having broken into the Duchesse 's bedroom was all nonsense . It appeared now that the Duc de Praslin himself was undersuspicion , though it seemed unthinkable that such a thing could be  --  a husband guilty of an inhuman attack upon his own wife . The poor woman had bled to death from over a score of wounds and had been brutally beaten beside . " No , no ! " Henriette could scarcely whisper the protest that interruptedhis recital . " Thar 's not possible . Monsieur le Duc could never  --  You do n't know what you 're saying . " But he merely shrugged expressively . He was only repeating what all Paris was saying . At first even the police had refused to believe it . But they had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had followed the advice of the Duc 's own valet and searched his rooms they had found plenty of evidence against him . Oh , yes , it looked very bad indeed for Monsieur le Duc . He was under guard and they were taking nochances of his escape . No matter if he was a Peer of France , answerableonly to the King , people meant to see that he paid for murder like any other criminal . " And what  --  do they say of me ? " Henriette heard herself askingfaintly . He answered with another shrug , eyeing her curiously across the tray with its thick pottery cup and plate . Her name had certainlybeen mentioned . He could not deny that . Some said that she and Monsieur le Duc had been  --  well , what men and women often were to one another . There had been rumors before about the part she had played in that family . They said there had been no love lost between the Duchesse and the children 's governess ; they hinted much worse things than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conciergerie for questioning . They meant to get to the bottom of what lay behind so ghastly a murder . She would be answering them herself soon . Then she would know more than he could tell her . No , he could not say how long she must stay in the Conciergerie . But she should be thankful she was here . It would not be safe for her to walk the streets of Paris just now . It was not a public courtroom into which they led Henriette , but a smaller , private one where perhaps a dozen men had gathered . Their faces were so many blank disks to her as she took her place in their midst and waited for the questioning to begin . The shock of the guard 's words that morning had left her numb , with the same incredulous despair she had felt when Albert Remey had aroused her from sleep with the fatal news . She had lost the power to think , much less feel . It surprised her to find that she could still walk erectly and without trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been placed for her near the Judge 's desk . Monsieur Broussais , who was to conduct the interrogation , barely looked up as she entered . His hands were busy with numerouspapers , and he appeared engrossed in conversation withp288another man , le Procureur du Rol . They talked together in low tones , while the rest regarded her with undisguised curiosity and made whispered comments among themselves . Flies buzzed maddeningly ; one lighted in her hair and though she brushed it away again and again , it always returned . So absorbed was she in trying to rid herself of it that she hardly realized the hearing had begun until she was being addressed . They were speaking her name , yet it seemed to belong to some one else , to bear no relationship to her personally . So began the first examination of Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes , aged thirty-five years , spinster , governess , native of Paris , resident of the pensionconducted by Madame Le Maire at Number 9 , Rue du Harlay , in the district Marais . The first questions put to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ of the Praslin family ? What salary had she received ? What had been the nature of her duties ? She repliedin a steady voice that surprised . But the next question came in a different tone . Monsieur Broussais leaned across the desk and fixed her with his enigmatical , deep-set eyes . " We have already learned that you were guilty of grave wrong in this household : that you did not show the deceased Duchesse proper regard , that you sought to alienate the affections of her husband and children . Is this true ? " The other occupants of the room also leaned forward in their places . Henriette felt the slight rustle of excitement that followed his words , and she knew that the time had come to give more than a perfunctory answer . All eyes were upon her as they waited for words from her lips . She summoned them to her as one might call upon a well trained pack of hounds to perform their duty . " No , monsieur . " She spoke clearly and without hesitation . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household , matters were already on a very bad footing . There had been governessesbefore me , but they left because they found it impossible to get on with Madame la Duchesse . Always there was trouble over the children and their education . "  | " And what was the nature of this trouble you mention ? " " The Duc wished to direct that himself , and it was understood from the first that I should be accountable only to Monsieur . I was to live and dine with the children in separate quarters . I told the Duc that this was a difficult position for me and great responsibility , and some adjustments were made . But it was not easy . The former governess was still there when I took up my duties , and naturally she resented my presence . From the first she prejudiced the Duchesse against me . Madame continued to interfere with the children 's affairs and the results were unfortunate . Monsieur was greatly displeased and expressed himself so to Madame . So we came to live more and more apart , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win them away from their mother . The disagreements between the Duc and Duchesse continued , and it was beyond my power to change that . Perhaps it was wrong for me to have accepted so extraordinary a position , but I never tried to hurt Madame . If I did sometimes answer her with annoyance it was only because I had been myself unjustly hurt . " " And what , " the questioning voice was going on , " were the causes of this dissension you speak of between the Duc and the Duchesse ? " " On the Duchesse 's part it seemed to be a desire to dominate the children , and above all her husband . With the Duc it seemed to be a fixed spirit of resistance , though he was less violent by nature . " " Your presence in the intimate life of this family seems to have particularly inspired the Duchesse 's jealousy . Was there good cause ? " " I can not deny that at times Madame la Duchesse showed marked jealousy towards me , jealousy which had no grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less strained . When she was in good humor and treated me graciously I could forget her unjust accusations . There I was ,  |p290messieurs  , without money or friends . I had to try my best to keep the position though often it took all my patience . Then , too , Monsieur le Duc offered me a pension if I had the courage  --  those were his very words  --  to complete the education of his older daughters , and I had promised , difficult though that might be . " The matter of the pension had to he investigated : Had it been part of the original agreement when she took up her duties ? Had a definite figure been set ? What could she recall of the conversationconcerning it ? A long pause followed while Monsieur Broussaismade notes on the papers before him . Then he cleared his throat in preparation for his next sally . In the tense quiet of the room that had an ominous sound . " Is it not true , " he asked , " that the Duchesse , particularly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband ? " So , the old scandal had cropped up again . Henrietta had known it must , and she was prepared to face it . " Never , monsieur , no , never that ! " She made the denial swiftly , then she spoke more slowly , weighing her words with care , realizingas she did the significance of the question . " The Duchesse knew that such relations could not have existed . She did not accuseme of them . She may have said so to others , but not to me . Certain libelous articles did appear in the newspapers . Two years ago , while I was staying with the children in Corsica , there was a very malicious one and I wanted to leave at once because of it . But the Marechal Sebastiani , the Duchesse 's own father , persuadedme to stay . For some time the Duchesse did treat me harshly . But then she grew less cold , and all through this past winter she was gracious to me . I had even hoped we might come to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed to be told that my presence was no longer desired . " Monsieur Broussais 's expression remained impassive during this recital . When she stopped speaking he reached among the papers before him and selected one which he handed to her . It was writ/ten on a sheet of the Duchesse 's own note paper , and though it bore no date or salutation she recognized it as one written to her , beginning : If it is forbidden to go to rest without being reconciled to one 's neighbor , it seems to me that a New Year is a still more urgent rea. son for putting aside all disagreements and forgetting all complaints . So , she thought , staring down at that familiar writing , they had already been to Madame Le Maire 's and rifled the box where she kept her private possessions . " This letter , " she explained , " was written by the Duchesse to me a year ago . It came with a bracelet as a New Year 's gift . I remember it very well because it marked a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater with the young ladies sometimes , and even discussed the subject of their future marriage . She asked me to use my influence with the Duc about his views on this matter , but I had to refuse that . I could not intrude in anything so personal . " When the letter had been returned to Monsieur Broussais 's portfolio , more questions followed . These concerned her dismissal , the date of her leaving the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , and whether she had continued to see the Duc . There were others , as to how and where she had passed the night of August 17th , how she had first heard of yesterday 's tragedy , and why she had not been at Madame Le Maire 's when the police agents came for her . It was the next question that brought her to her feet , her eyes wide and panic-stricken as they turned upon her questioner . " Have you learned of the grave charges against Monsieur le Duc ? Do you know that he is believed to have murdered his wife ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching the faces one by one in frantic appeal . " Tell me it 's only some unfounded rumor . I can not believe he could have done it . He could never bear to see the slightest suffering of one of his children . Please tell me these changes are not  --  what you say ! " P292But no one reassured her ; the eyes continued to watch the effect of the news upon her . She knew from their silence that this was more than some wild rumor . It could not be true , and yet if it should be . . . Somehow she must make them understand the part she had unwittingly played in all this . The letter ! She must try to explain about it . It came over her now in a lightning flash of conviction that she alone held the key to this horror . That letter of recommendation had been written in the Duchesse 's blood . Her knees were shaking ; her hands clasping and unclasping themselves . She heard herself pleading , babbling broken , incoherentphrases , as Madame Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me . He could never have done this dreadful thing . . . but if he should have had any part in it  --  Mon Dieu , then it is I who am the guilty one because I asked too much . . . . I , who so loved the children , adored them .... I was a coward not to accept my fate . I wrote them . You can see the letters for yourselves . I told them how unhappy I was , that I no longer cared to live . I was afraid to face the future . Oh , I was wrong , wrong ! I ought not to have let them know my misery . I should have pretended I was resigned , even happy in that bare , small room . I ought to have told them to forget me and think only of their mother . But I was not brave enough for that . I was driven to despair , and I wanted to die . I had a bottle of laudanum , and I drank it . Unfortunately I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . After six years of such happiness among those children I loved and who loved me , the emptiness seemed unbearable . I can see it all now , and now it is too late . He must have gone to her demanding that fatal letter of recommendation the Duchesse had promised me . She must have refused him , and then . . . There , you see , I am guilty . Write it down there in your records  --  guilty . " Monsieur Broussais 's voice cut into her recital , cool and precise and edged with irony . " It seems hardly possible , mademoiselle , that such a display of emotion , and such lofty sentiments as these you have just ex-P293ifpressed , should be applied to children . Was it to these children only that you addressed the despairing letters you mentioned ? " " Yes , monsieur . " She raised her eyes directly to his . " All sentimentscan be lofty , as you say . Ca n't you understand that ? But I wo n't deny that when the Duc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there did not mingle with the love I felt for the children , a genuine affection for their father . " She caught her breath sharply , and went on , her voice rising in the stillness of the room . " But I never brought sin into that home  --  adultery then , since that is in your minds . I could never have held those children close if I had been guilty of that . They were like my own children , though perhaps I am wrong to use those words for this whole little band . Still , that is how it was . Ca n't you understand that it is possible to love honestly ? " Question followed question , but she answered without hesitationMonsieur Broussais 's bombardment . Now that she had rallied from the first shock , her wits returned , and she was able to meet and turn aside his deft , sarcastic implications . She met the challengewith squared shoulders and a swift , sure fire of words that kept all eyes upon her ; that even brought a grudging hint of admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited like a cat to pounce on any remark that might be misinterpreted , to twist anything that could be turned as evidence against her . She knew how much depended on her answers . It was not enough to speak the truth and that alone . One must be clever as well as honest . Outside , the noon sun stood high over the roofs of Paris , over the metallic glitter of the Seine parting its watery coil above the Ile de la Cite , about the Palais de Justice and the Conciergerie . Inside the crowded room the air grew heavy , and a merciless glare filled the unshaded windows . Men 's faces gleamed with heat . Monsieur Broussais paused often to wipe the moisture from brow and spectacles . Henriette 's handkerchief was a limp ball in her hands . She pushed the damp hair from her forehead and accepteda sip of water from a glass an attendant offered . Shep294must not let her mind wander for an instant . No matter how the flies buzzed or how her eyes and head ached from trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she must keep on the alert . All her life she had loved words and kindled to them , but now she was in their power . They shot to and fro , like shuttles weaving the threads of some invisible pattern . If only one could know the pattern one wove in that hot room while minutes ticked away into hours ! Ruthlessly as a surgeon dissecting a patient , Monsieur Broussais'squestions probed to the very core of that life in the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , in Melun , and iii Corsica . The quick blade of his irony delicately laid bare the tissues wrapping cause and motive . He must trap her into some unguarded admission of complicity . But she , too , held a blade as powerful as her questioners . She was speaking the truth . She had nothing to hide from him . At last Monsieur Broussais pushed aside his papers with an impatientgesture . It was plain that he tired of these constant allusions to the Praslin children and the controversies between them and their mother . Here was a crime of unspeakable brutality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given to investigate , and this poised , attractive woman sitting before him refused to allow herself to play into his hands . She dared to confoundhim with answers as crisp as his questions , answers in which he could not find the admissions of guilt he had expected to uncover without much difficulty . " Come , mademoiselle . " He spoke brusquely . " We must keep to the point . We are here to consider , not these suspicions betweenyourself and the deceased Duchesse , not the jealousy which brought about your immediate dismissal , or this letter of recommendation , the importance of which you have stressed . What concerns us now is a matter of the most serious trouble that can be brought into any household  --  discord between man and wife . You were supported by the husband against the wife . Can you deny that this was so ? "   " In certain matters , true . But how could I know how far it was carried , or how serious the trouble between them actually had become ? As to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only repeat that the Duc de Praslin never showed other feelings for me than friendship and esteem . Again I must protest , and I will not mince words  --  he was never my lover . " The sincerity of her denial was apparent . But Monsieur Broussaiswas not through . " Yet in the brief interval since you left that household , " he pressed her , " you have penned letters which you yourself admit you did wrong to write , and you allowed the Duc to pay you visits , three at least . Yesterday you were to have gone to that house to see the Duchesse about this letter , and yesterday she met a violent death . How do you explain all these coincidences ? " " I ca n't explain them , to myself or to you . I can only say what I have said before . I can only repeat that nothing wrong ever passed between myself and Monsieur le Due , and there was never any future wrong intended . " She hesitated for a moment , gathering words to answer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you the children 's interests came first with me always . If the Duchesse had died a natural death , and if the Duc had then asked me to marry him , I should not have consented for their sakes to such a misalliance . And I had no idea of any other wrong . If Monsieur le Duc had loved me , there is no telling  --  I might have sacrificed my life and reputation for him . But as it was I never tried to come between him and his wife . I would not have harmed a hair of her head . I 'm telling you the truth , monsieur , and you must believe me . Is there not something in the tone of a voice that can convince you of that ? " Her ability at anticipating questions and turning her answers into direct appeal had scored her several points . The group of listeners could not help being swayed by her eloquence and lack of pretense . Monsieur Broussais was himself amazed . He had never been called upon to examine such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration . The interview was not over . Once more he brought out a handful of papers for her to identify . " You have here before you , " he interposed , " certain letters . Were they written by you ? " " Yes , monsieur . I sent them to the older Praslin daughters a month or so ago . " " One of them contains an unfinished sentence , whose full meaning is not clear : You do not speak of your father . I hope that he is well and continues to keep his courage . It seems to me I should be less unhappy if I were sure to suffer  --  ' Will you please complete the sentence for us ? " Henriette 's heart sank . She had regretted that letter ever since it had been dispatched . She had written it impulsively to Louise on a day when it had seemed impossible to go on alone in the Rue du Harlay . Read aloud like this , apart from its context , the sentence certainly took on more significance than she had intendedat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence with the word alone , ' " she told them , " or perhaps with the phrase for all of you . ' I cannotremember why I broke off . Perhaps I decided it would be better not to speak to the young girls of their father . " Monsieur Broussais nodded as he took charge of the letters once more . " You did right , " he commented dryly , " quite right , because it contained expressions of feeling which were not fit for young girls to share . " A quick protest rose to her lips , but the hearing was over . For the present at least Monsieur Broussais and his associates were done with her . A court clerk was already beginning to copy down the notes he had made of those questions and her answers . " God alone knows , " she thought as she passed by that desk on her way from the room , " who will read these words that have gone out of my keeping . " Outside those doors , the spirit that had carried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausted , as shakenp297and spent as if she were an old woman . The store of energy that she had called to her aid for the last hour was gone . She was grateful for the guard 's arm as she mounted once more to her room in the Conciergerie . She could not swallow the meal they brought her . She shook her head when they gave her permission to walk in the courtyard for half an hour . So they left her , and she sat on through the interminableafternoon , trying to recall each word that had been spoken at the hearing . Why had she not thought of such and such an answer ? Had she made them understand about that letter ? What other private papers of hers , of the Duc and of the Duchesse , might not Monsieur Broussais and the police be poring over at that very moment ? They all believed the Duc was guilty , and that she was his accomplice in crime . Though she had not slept in the Faubourg-Saint-Honore that night , they all believed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not possible , " she repeated as she had repeated that morning . " It 's not possible . Monsieur le Duc could never have done such a terrible thing . " She said the words over and over , and yet all the while she was unconvinced . She wanted to believe in that first rumor of the mysterious assassin who had escaped into the garden , but she could not . She was remembering the strained expression of his face as she had seen it last in Madame Le Maire 's poorly lighted hall . She remembered how the stair rail had quivered under his grip . She thought of those large , powerful hands that she had seen so often laid fondly upon one child or another or on Berthe 's yellow hair . And now they were stained with blood . The sudden recollection of a spring night came to her , the night when he and Louise had surprised her by their return from the country . He had poured out a glass of port , and some of the wine had spilled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white skin and how fastidiously he had wiped them away . Six years ago last May , that had been .. . " It 's not possible , " she kept repeating stubbornly . P298Yet she knew too well the truth her lips denied . The daily venom of the Duchesse 's jealousy had corroded his self-control . It was as if an oak tree that had defied storms and woodsmen had fallen at last under the incessant hammerings of a woodpecker . A key clicked in the lock , and the door was opened . She roused at the sound of a familiar voice speaking her name , scarcely daringto believe in the reality of her visitor . Yet there before her stood the Reverend Frederic Monod . Sobs shook her as they had not shaken her through the long , dark hours of the night or duringthe hearing that morning . She was no longer alone , and that knowledge overwhelmed her . " But how did you come here ? " she asked when she grew calmer . " Albert and Marie Remey tried , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in Paris . " He kept her hands in his and spoke reassuringly . " I am your friend , Mademoiselle Deluzy , Mademoiselle Desportes  --  itdoes not matter which name you go by , and I am also your spiritual adviser . They can not deny you the comfort of your church , no matter what the charges are against you . " " Oh , Monsieur Monod , I hardly know yet what the charges are . This terrible crime , and they say he has clone it , and only night before last he came , with the children  --  " She struggled against her tears at the memory . " Tell me what you will , " he said . " Do n't be afraid that I shall repeat your confidences . I know what they are saying of your part in this  --  " " You do n't believe that I am guilty ? " " No . " He shook his head . " But even if I were in doubt I should have come to you here . You would have needed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the news . Those first reports made no mention of your name , but I knew you were a member of that household , and I guessed the shock would be too much for you . I did not know you had left . I did not know till I reached Paris this morning that they had taken you into custody . " She managed to tell him all she could of her dismissal , of theP299Duc 's last visit , and the letter which she insisted must have been the cause of the tragedy . " Yes , " he agreed , " it may be as you say . Goliath went down before a pebble from David 's sling , and this letter of yours , no doubt , was the final blow . But you must not dwell on that . You have made mistakes ; so have we all , though some of us are less ready to admit them . " " Monsieur Monod "  --  she faced him through her tears as she poured out the story of those six difficult years , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to have told you all this before  --  before it was too late . I ought to have asked your advice . But I was so sure of myself . I believed I could manage my own life . Mud might spatter and spoil other skirts , but not mine . Somehow I believed no harm could come to me because I meant no harm to others . I was defiant and proud because I felt too sure of myself . " " You are not the first to make that mistake , " he answered gravely . " We all believe our lives are our own till we find we cannotseparate them from other lives . " " And I thought , " she went on , " I thought , because I committed no actual wrong , that I was above reproach . But now  --  it 's terrible to think that she met this violent death , and that I , too , am being held to account for it . I could never like her . I could never respect her . Even now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupidities , but I can never forget that she might be alive today , poor soul , if I had not insisted on what I believed was my right . Nothing I can do or say can ever change that . She is dead , and God knows what will become of him and of the children . " Monsieur Monod did not try to ease her with trite phrases of comfort . He did not offer to pray for her as other ministers of the Gospel might have done . " You are too honest to make excuses for yourself , " he said . " You are suffering far more than you deserve ; for , the greater one 's capacity for living , the greater one 's capacity for suffering . But remember that the greatest wisdom is to find out one 's folly . P300Keep your courage , mademoiselle . You 'll need it , whether Monsieurle Duc is able to clear himself of these charges or not . " She begged for news of the Duc , but he could tell her little more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . Each newspaper edition published a more sensationalstory than the last . Monsieur Monod told her what he could , without attempting to keep other aspects of the case from her . The whole country was aroused , and feeling grew more and more intense . It involved the King and the whole structure of his court . " Out there , " he told her , " the people believe that the Duc is guilty , and they want to see him tried like any other criminal . But , being a nobleman , he is answerable only to his superiors in rank  --  the King and the House of Peers . If he should be freed of this murder charge , the King is sure to be accused of discrimination ; and if he is convicted , that will bring great censure on the court circle . You know the discontent that is in the very air . " Yes , she knew , though she had not thought of that before . Her personal problems had absorbed her completely . But now she sensed what lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the public ready to pounce on anything that savored of corruptionin court circles . This might be the chance the country had been waiting for , to assert its power . It was ironical , she thought , that she should figure in a case involving the House of Peers and the King himself  --  she , who had championed the cause of a new Republic , who had always been so outspoken in her denunciation of the House of Orleans . " I know the feeling is against me , too , " she said . " One of the guards told me so this morning . He said I was safer here in the Conciergerie than at large in Paris . " Once more Monsieur Monod did not try to soften his answer . " There are wild rumors going about , " he admitted . " Unfortunatelyyour name is coupled with the Due 's . You know the publicis more easily swayed by persons than by principles . It 's simplerto fasten blame to a man or a woman than to a system ofP301government . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to hour . I 've seen public opinion shift like a wind and put out the very fire it lighted . " " Or the fire can spread , monsieur , till there 's no longer any chance to put it out . " " Well , " he told her , " the King is hurrying back to Paris . It 's not a simple case of murder that he has to deal with . For that reason it is important that you have a good lawyer at once . You have a right to legal advice , and I shall see that you have the best we can find . " But she shook her head . " No , Monsieur Monod , I can do without a lawyer . I can answer their questions for myself . " " But you have no knowledge of the law , my child , and you must have help in giving your testimony . Some ignorant blunder on your part , some sudden impulse , might do you great harm . " " I 'll take the risk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did today . " " You must n't be hasty in this . If it 's the matter of money that makes you hesitate , you 're not to give that a thought . I have means enough to help you , and I happen to have influential friends in the law . You shall have the best possible counsel . " " You 're more than kind to me , " she broke in . " I do n't know why you should be when I have no claim upon you . I ask no reason for your generosity , I am only very grateful . But a lawyer would confuse me . The truth is all I have to offer , and I must give it to them in my own way . " He smiled at her in spite of his disapproval . " Have it your way then , " he said . There was a knock at the door , and a voice warned them that Monsieur Monod had overstayed his allotted time . " I have n't prayed with you , my child , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of making your own prayers . Mine you will have , and those of my household . "   " It 's good to know that . And you 'll come again ? " She clung-to him anxiously . " As often as they will let me . Remember , you are not alone . You have friends . The Remeys are waiting for me now . Have you any messages for them ? " " Only my love and thanks . And perhaps if you were to talk with my grandfather  --  " She told him the address and hurried on . " He has never thought well of me . He opposed my taking this place . That was why I used another name ; but still he is my only relative , and at such a time he might be willing to come to my aid . " " I 'll see what I can do . I 'll go to him with your message at once . Is there anything else on your mind ? " " If you could bring me any word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger ones . And , yes , there is one more thing . Tell Albert and Marie to remind Madame Le Maire of the basket on my window sill . It would be a pity to have the fruit spoil , and the melon ought to be ripe by now . " P303DURING THAT WEEK of August 18 to 24 , 1847 , all France rocked with horrified impatience at each day 's revelation in the Praslin murder case . Not only in Paris and Marseilles , but in Brussels , Amsterdam , and Berlin , in London and Manchester , men and women discussed it in shocked voices , avid for more details . They read the doctors ' reports on the body of the Duchesse , describing minutely the score of wounds , almost any one of which had been deep enough to prove fatal . They pored over diagrams of Number 55 , Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore , following those gruesome ink marks which represented the bloody tracks the victim had left on furniture , floor , and walls during the savage struggle ; the red prints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They devoured the testimony of the servants who had answered her summons ; that testimony which was united in its accounts of domestic discord and in its insistence that the lately dismissed governess had been the chief cause of quarrels between Monsieur and Madame . They read of the valet , Charpentier , and his shrewd advice to the police not to- earch for the murderer outside the house but to look into his master 's quarters . They marveled at the reiterated denials of the Due , confronted as he was by such irrefutable evidence as a blood-stained dressing gown and shirt ; the charred remains of burned letters and papers in his fireplace , and those unexplained scratches and bites upon his hands . How could he cling so stubbornly to his flimsy story of an assassin in the face of such indubitable proof of his own guilt ? How could any man , let alone the head of one of the noblest families in France , do such a deed of violence and brutality , people asked one another on either side of the Channel . The opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal of his day . From statesmen to shopkeepers andP304street venders , it was agreed that no further evidence was needed to condemn him , and no death sentence could be cruel enough for such a man . And this Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes , the exgovernesswhose name and accomplishments figured so prominentlyin every version of the crime  --  what of her ? She , too , was being torn.to shreds in a variety of languages . Always a woman in the case , they agreed , and what a woman she must be ! No man hacked a faithful wife , the mother of his nine children , to death unless some other woman had driven him to madness . She must be the most subtle siren on record , yet how could that be possible for a governess in her middle thirties , and not beautiful either according to the papers ? But one could never explain such things . The Duc had visited her with several of the children only a few hours before the murder . She had admitted that much and more in a secret hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was well they had done so at once , for with feeling running so high against her there was no telling what a mob might do . As early as Friday August loth , the London Times was already commenting on the importance of the case in an editorial : The Paris papers of Wednesday , received by our ordinary express , contain no political news of any importance . " Even had it been otherwise , " says one of our correspondents , " public attention is so painfully absorbed by the murder of the Duchesse de Praslin that nothing short of an insurrection would attract notice . " On Saturday August 21st , Paris papers announced that the Duc de Praslin had the night before been secretly removed under close guard from his residence to the prison of the Luxembourg . There he was said to be suffering from a mysterious illness . His indispositionwas considered serious enough to warrant the attention of his personal physician , Dr. Louis , and to delay his examination by Chancellor Pasquier , President of the House of Peers . Alarm-P305ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner 's condition , which was said to be growing serious . Meanwhile the Court of Peers gathered to present the arraignment . No one who reported on the events of that week could actually be sure what new turn the case might take from hour to hour . Informationreceived on good authority might be worthless by the time it had been set in type . The most conservative papers read like lurid gossip sheets , and even important figures in literary circlesleft their desks to crowd the benches at the first public hearings , setting down their impressions of those concerned in 1'aflaire Praslin . Victor Hugo , writing a day-to-day account in his " Choses Vues , " commented on many phases of the investigation . He noted on Sunday August 22nd : At the present moment one can perceive , in Mademoiselle Deluzy 's window in Madame Le Maire 's house , Rue du Harlay , the melon , the bouquet and the basket of fruit which the Duc brought from the country the very evening before the murder . The Duc is seriously ill . People say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the family and excerpts from her first questioning , he continued : Mademoiselle Deluzy is still in the Conciergerie . She walks about in the courtyard each day for two hours . Sometimes she wears a nankeendress , sometimes a striped silk gown . She knows that many eyes are fixed upon her at the windows . Those who watch her say she strikes attitudes . Another writer in Gazette des Tribunaux added a more detailedaccount of her during that period of daily exercise : The description of Mademoiselle Deluzy given in is not altogethercorrect . She is dressed simply , but is not wanting in distinctionor grace . Her figure has lost the suppleness of early youth , but her eyes , which are circled with dark rings , have an intelligent ex/pression . Her complexion is pale and shows fatigue ; her hair , of rich brown , is arranged with taste . She wore yesterday a nankeen dress , a black scarf , and a straw bonnet with lilac ruching . She walked slowly , her arms crossed on her breast , and her head bent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with one shock after another in the avalanche of calamity that had overtaken her . Her second examination took place , this one beforeChancellor Pasquier . Of this proces verbal Victor Hugo made mention , quoting one of his colleagues as saying : You will see Mademoiselle Deluzy . She is a rare woman . Her lettersare masterpieces of wit and style . Her response to questioning is admirable . . . . If you had heard her you would have been astounded . No one has more grace , more tact , or more intelligence . If she wishes to write some day for us , we will give her , par Dieu , the Montyon Prize . For the rest she is headstrong and imperious ; a woman at once wicked and charming . Henriette was better prepared for her second ordeal , though the sleeplessness from which she suffered and the strain of waiting had told upon her . She needed no mirror to confirm her feeling that youth had left her forever . The elasticity of hope was gone out of her step and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same unflinching directness she had shown before . Her answers came without hesitation , each word as direct and well chosen as the Chancellor 's own . For hours the verbal tournament went on . " You did not try then , as you should have tried in every way possible , to bring these children closer to their mother ? " " I tried sometimes , at first , but it was useless ; and though the Duchesse did not approve of many of Monsieur Praslin 's ideas on their education , she seemed willing to leave that to him . She never gave me any orders about their welfare , except in matters that concerned their dress , and she rarely talked to them . When we were by ourselves , which was seldom , she would talk to me ofp307matters above the heads of children . They grew restless and preferred to be alone with me , and this annoyed their mother . " " Did you not realize , " Chancellor Pasquier persisted , " that such isolation from her children must be painful to a mother  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Praslin ? " " Quite the contrary , monsieur . I believe on my soul and honor that Madame de Praslin was far more preoccupied with her feelings for her husband than about her children , whom she sent away when their father was present in order to be alone with him . She was constantly trying to divert his attention from them to herself . I have seen her leave the room abruptly if Monsieur le Duc played with or fondled one of the children . She was alwaysshowing her jealousy and irritation at such marks of affection . The children realized this and , with the innocent malice of their age , only redoubled their demonstrations to their father . I saw the harm that this sort of struggle did them , but it was not always in my power to prevent the bad effect of it . As time went on and my love for my pupils grew greater , I could not keep entirelyimpartial to all this daily friction . I could not give back to Madame de Praslin those she had willfully , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her explanation left the Chancellor unconvinced . There was open rebuke in his next words and in the manner of their delivery . " From all you say , it is evident that you are trying to throw the entire blame upon Madame de Praslin . It is hardly your place to be the judge in such matters , and your words lead me to doubt that you did all it was your duty to do in meeting so deplorable a situation between this mother and her children . It appears from the testimony of others and from documents in our possession that you exercised almost absolute power over these young people . We are forced to believe that you have been far , very far , from conducting yourself in such circumstances as you ought to have done . " Once more Henriette gathered all her forces to reply .  | " I would not for the world be lacking in respect for Madame de Praslin 's memory , " she began . " But you ask the truth of me , and I am bound to tell the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not criticize Madame 's heart or her intentions , but her characteris another matter . Her temperament was difficult , very irritableand inflexible , which made her incapable of handling so many children of various ages , minds , and dispositions . She had not the faculty of winning the heart and confidence of youth . She would take undue offense over some small matter where indulgencewas needed and then pass over some important issue that called for firmness . These were the reasons why Monsieur le Due insisted upon her not meddling in the children 's education . Unfortunately the Due 's pleasure in his daughters ' company angeredthe Duchesse . We all suffered in consequence . " " And so it appears that the authority which had disappeared entirely from Madame de Praslin 's hands passed into yours ; the affection of the children for their mother also became concentrated in you . Suppose you did not actually exert yourself to bring this about , you must have seen how matters were and known that it was your duty to prevent , rather than aggravate the situation . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal results which have followed . " Chancellor Pasquier had shifted from question to direct accusation , but Henriette had her defense ready . " I never said , I will turn the affections of these children for their mother to myself . ' But I loved them and I devoted my whole self to them . Their pleasures were my pleasures ; their pain was my pain . Six years I watched over them by day and by night . They loved me with all the enthusiasm of their years , and I returnedtheir love . I was without family ties , without friends , and all my feelings were bound up in my duties , which were so congenialand pleasant . What more can I say except to ask you this : Could not any mother have won her children to her if she had wished to do so ? " This unfortunate ability for turning questions upon her ques/tioners made her a spirited witness . Like Monsieur Broussais , the Chancellor found her more than his match in repartee . But she never went too far in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , though at times her crispness verged on arrogance , she maintained a respectful dignity of bearing and speech that was above reproach . Again she was questioned about her last meeting with the Duc , and again she gave a full recital of that evening visit to Madame Le Maire 's with its fatal emphasis on the letter of recommendation . Only once did she falter , when it came to repeating his last words to her : " I play a sorry part in all this . . . Good night till tomorrow . " " And Monsieur de Praslin said nothing that might have led you to think he was roused to go to such lengths with the Duch-esse ? " " No , never . " She spoke with unusual vehemence . " By all that I hold sacred in life ! I do not know if I am allowed to mention here certain facts , known to me alone , which proved that the violence was not always on Monsieur le Due 's side . I often heard the Duchesse threaten to take her own life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Once at Melun she tried to stab herself , and the Duc in disarming her wounded his hand . Again at Dieppe , after a quarrel , she rushed out of the house , threatening to throw herself into the sea . But with those unpredictableand changing characteristics of which I have told you , she was found later by Monsieur le Duc in a shop , apparently quite calm again and making some purchases . " She had hoped to arouse sympathy for the Duc , but it was evidentfrom the Chancellor 's comment that he considered this only another proof of the desperate extremity of the Duchesse . The hearing proceeded much as the first one had done , but with more minute questioning on the daily life and routine of the household . Where Monsieur Broussais had questioned her specifically as to improper relations with the Due , Chancellor Pasquier seemed more inclined to believe her protestations that no such liaison could have existed . He seemed determined to prove her guilty ofp310a far less obvious crime . His interest now centered upon her undueinfluence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents . It was a clever move on his part to shift the emphasis in order to prove her guilty of a deliberate campaignto estrange the children from their mother . Her own admissionscould be used against her in this way . If she tried to justify her hold over her young pupils by explaining their mother'sjealousy and indifference , she would be accused of laying the blame upon a dead woman who could not be called upon to clear herself . If she did not account for her sympathy toward the childrenand their father , she would appear more than ever what the public believed her to be  --  a scheming serpent whose wiles were behind that tragedy of August 18th . She knew she stood between the two pitfalls . She could only cling , as she had told the ReverendMonsieur Monod she would cling , to the truth . That was her only weapon of defense against these officials in their red robes who sorted and weighed her acts and words as deliberately as if they were actually balancing them on mental scales . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " I did not try to take them from their mother . One can not steal affections , messieurs ; they are given freely or not at all . And you must believe me when I tell you I am not maligning the Duchesse . She was the same to others , often unjust and fault-finding , but she had kind impulses too . One moment she could cut to the quick , and in the next be generous and pleasant . Often in the space of an hour she would be like that , perhaps blaming me because she thought I exerted too great influence over her family and then presently coming to beg me to use it to gain some favor for herself . She would hurt me cruelly or make me some handsomepresent . One never knew what to expect . " But this seemed to be taken by her questioners as further proof of the Duchesse 's goodness . More questions followed . Henriette 's head throbbed with them . The room with all those watching faces swam in a haze before her , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In every answer you make , you insinuate some wrong against Madame de Praslin , " the voice rebuked again . Tears of protest and weariness rose to her eyes . She wiped them away and forced herself to answer in a voice that shook from the long strain . " I wish sincerely that I need not say what I do . She is dead , messieurs . If I could bring her back to life by giving mine , even by suffering those horrible tortures , I would do so . But I can do nothing now . I knew every turn of her mind in these six years , her every change of mood . No one knows better than I her strange power of shifting from anger to generosity , from disdain to kindness . I have not said a word that was disrespectful or untrue . I do not defend myself . I have only tried to make things clear . " The second examination of Mademoiselle Henriette DeluzyDesporteswas over . They led her back to her room in the Conciergerie . By that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Praslin 's condition had grown alarming , though Henriettewas ignorant of them . Across the river in the prison of the Luxembourg it was plain to the doctors that they could do nothing to combat the poison that was steadily gaining possession of their patient . The Duc de Praslin was dying . Only his superb strength had kept him alive with ' all that arsenic in his system . They ag Need among themselves that he must have taken enough to kill half a dozen men , judging by the tortures he suffered . A smaller dose would have proved fatal within a few hours , but the amount he had managed to consume some time during the day he had been taken into custody , was so powerful that he had all but defeated his own end . For nature had reacted to the poison instead of being immediately overcome by it . He had borne his sufferings at first with stoical indifference , but as the agony increased his half-suppressed groans were terrible to hear . These and the convulsions that shook him at inter/vals were , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He had already been questioned , first by the police on the morning of the crime and later by Chancellor Pasquier . The latterhad urged him to make full confession , but he had persisted in his denials . From first to last he had clung to the same story , insisting that he had been awakened by shrieks and had hurried to his wife 's bedroom . In the horror and confusion that ensued he could give no clear account of himself and his actions . The bloodstainson his robe and shirt must have come there when he had taken the dying Duchesse in his arms ; the pistol found near her was his , he had caught it up when he went to her aid . He could not account for the blood and strands of hair upon it . Why had he tried to wash away the bloodstains ? To that question he answeredthat he had done so because he did not wish to frighten his children by such a sight . He made no effort to explain the burning papers in his fireplace . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what he had done at such a time , and under such stress ? He begged them to spare him further questions till tomorrow . He felt too weak to answer . But the Chancellor had persisted . It would not take much of Monsieur le Duc 's breath to reply briefly " Yes " or " No " to the charges . What about those marks on his hands ? The scratches , he explained , he had suffered in the country when he had helped to pack the trunks and boxes for their journey . And the bites ? They were not bites . The doctors said otherwise . Well , he could not answer for the doctors , and he felt too weakened to be pressed foi details . " You are always speaking of your weakness , Monsieur de Praslin . No wonder you feel so when you think of your children and of this horrible crime you have committed . " " Crime ! " The Duc had roused himself a little . " I have committedno crime . As to the children , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in his hands and remained silent for some time . " Were you urged to this act by evil counsel ? " His questioner hoped to draw him out in this way , but the prisoner could not be forced into any mention of Mademoiselle Deluzy . His stubborn denials of all part in the murder continued . " I have had no counsel . People do not counsel such things . " " You are being devoured by remorse . Would it not ease your conscience if you told the truth ? " Again the evasive plea : " My strength fails me today . " " Do you dare to affirm that you have not committed this crime ? " Again no response , and again the question was repeated . " Your silence gives the answer for you , " the Chancellor continued . " You are guilty . Is n't that so ? " " You have come here with a conviction of my guilt . Nothing I might say could change your opinion . " " You can do so if you will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can only hold you re-sponsible . " " I tell you I am not able to go on . It is beyond my strength . " " Monsieur de Praslin , you are in a state of torture ; and as I said to you just now , a simple answer is all I ask of you . Are you or are you not responsible for this murder ? Answer yes or no . " " I can not reply to such a question . " Once more the Duc took refuge in silence which he steadily maintained to the last . The doctors marveled at his vitality . They did what they could to relieve his pangs , but they had been forbidden to administer opiates . He must not be allowed to lapse into unconsciousness while there was still a chance to bring him to a confession of his guilt . On Tuesday afternoon August 24th , at five o'clock , the Duc de Praslin drew his last breath in the prison of the Luxembourg , just seven days after his arrest . His death and burial were at/tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as possible . Of this event Victor Hugo noted : It would appear that Monsieur de Praslin was a very well made man . At the post-mortem the doctors were much struck . One exclaimed , " What a beautiful corpse ! " He was a fine athlete , Dr. Louis tells me . . . . The tomb in which they laid him bears a leaden plate , on which is the number ro54 . A number after his death , as convicts have in life , is the only epitaph of the Duc de Choiseul-Praslin . But others were less restrained in their comment . Once pub lished , the news spread rapidly , and public opinion was united in condemning the government for such negligence . All officials , from gendarmes to King Louis-Philippe himself , suffered severe censure . The murder had been shocking enough without allowing the obvious culprit to escape from the consequences . Suicide was too easy a way out for such a criminal . The law should have exactedthe extreme penalty for this deed , and instead it had been cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government that had condoned such evasion of justice . It did not matter to readers of newspapers whether that dose of arsenic had been deliberately smuggled in to the Duc by his superiors , or if he had foreseen his own extremity and prepared for it . One fact , they all agreed upon  --  this prisoner had not met the fate of an ordinary criminal . If he had not been a close friend of the King , and a Peer of France , he would be alive to face the grave charges against him . What was the use now of all the detailed reports of the examiners ? of the carefully tabulated evidence prepared by the police ? of the testimony of doctors and domestics ? There was no need now to fill columns of fine type with the pitiful , passionate contents of the Duchesse 's journal , or to print those letters the Duc had not burned , anguished appeals for affection that would never be gratified ; jealous tirades against " MademoiselleD . " Murdered and murderer were both mute . They could not be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red robes . The Praslin murder case had become a dead issue as far as the law was concerned . It was only a skeletonnow . But skeletons in royal closets are not easily dismissed , as King Louis-Philippe was to discover all too soon . Across the Channel a farsighted editor in the London Times wrote prophetically of l'affaire Praslin : Nothing could be more contrary to the interests of the Governmentthan the scandal arising from such an act at the present moment . It is more likely to exercise an unfavorable influence on their fortunes than a systematic sapping and mining of the public liberties for twenty years . The Government had but one chance , to hand the Duc de Praslin over to the public indignation . . . . We foresee that this most injudicious withdrawal of a culprit from justice will be turned against the French Government . We do not mean to attribute any share to the leading people of Paris in this most horrible and revolting crime . But it would be vain to deny that a profound demoralization does at this moment exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pursue this subject of the suicide of the Duc de Praslin . If the French Government have connived at it , they will soon find cause to repent their error . It is not probable that we have yet come to the end of this disastrous tale . Henriette may have read these very words , for during those last days of August she was allowed the privilege of newspapers . She still remained in the Conciergerie , still took her exercise in the courtyard each day , and still waited for the law to decide what to do with her . It was a vexing problem . The most careful examinationshad revealed nothing that could be used as tangible evidenceagainst her . She had made a remarkable impression upon her examiners during those hours of questioning . Yet the whole country believed her to be a party to the crime . Next to the Duc de Praslin she was most hated , and now that he was dead , she alone remained , the bird in their hands . From being an obscure governess without friends and in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single week the most despised and talked-of figure in France . P316PARIS ROOFS WERE SLEEK with November rains : The river flowedin sluggish gray under its bridges , and the tall old buildings on either bank were as drab as the blowing smoke from their chimneypots . The gardens of the Luxembourg and the Tuileries dripped in duns and browns , their benches clamp and deserted , even by beggars and sparrows , those most indefatigable city tramps . Only splashing horses and the vehicles they drew moved on the wet streets , or sodden figures under the domes of umbrellas . In an upper room of a house near the intersection of the Rues de Monceau and Teheran , Henriette stared through a moist windowpaneat a still more moist world . The room was not much larger than the Needle 's Eye , though its furnishing showed far more taste and comfort . A table had been drawn close to the window , and a variety of objects littered it  --  books , sewing materials , a pot of marigolds , a box of pastel crayons , besides writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occupied with any of these ; they lay idle and listless in her lap . A maid tapped at the door and , in response to a " Come in , " opened it a crack to deliver her message . " Madame Monod 's compliments , and would Mademoiselle Desportescare to join Monsieur and Madame in the salon for a cup of chocolate ? " But Henriette shook her head . " My thanks to Madame and Monsieur but my headache still prevents my joining them , and I will not be down for dinner . " After the maid had left , Henriette sat without moving while the rain kept up its monotonous drumming in the gutters outside . She had no headache , but one must give some excuse for refusing the kindness of friends . She was under enough obliga/tion to the Reverend Frederic Monod and his wife without al , - pearing indifferent to their efforts to distract her from the lethargywhich she could not shake off . They had been goodness itself , those two , insisting that she make her home with them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September day when she had been given her discharge by the law they had made her welcome , and she had been glad to take refuge in this shelter they offered . There had been no other choice except to go to Albert and Marie , for she could not return to Madame Le Maire 's establishment , and after the notoriety of the murder no hotel or pension would have dared to take her in . Her grandfather had made no effort to aid her , and she learned from those who had tried to enlist his sympathies that the old man 's health and finances were in a precarious state . He lived near Passy , completely under the domination of an unscrupulous old woman . So she could not look to her only relative for help in the difficulties she now faced . It was fortunate that Monsieur Nlonod had taken her and her cause to heart . He was a powerful and prosperous ally as well as his two brothers , one a wealthy merchant of Havre . The other , Adolphe , was also an influential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oratoire in Paris . The brothers Monod not only believed in her innocence and admired the couragewith which she had met her ordeal , but they were determined to rally their congregations to her side . Her Protestant faith had been against her in that Catholic household , and the murder now had taken on religious as well as political significance . In a Catholiccountry like France it was inevitable that this should be so . The Monods knew that even among the minority which their church represented prejudice against her would be difficult to overcome . All they could do for her now was to give her their support and hope that they could influence others of their faith to do likewise . They knew the violence of public opinion too well to expect it to be changed overnight . That would take months , even years to alter . Everywhere people branded Mademoiselle Deluzy-Desportes P318as the real instigator of the Praslin murder . Since her release she had become the target of a more intense and bitter hatred because she was the only living link in that triangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty and would have relished nothing more than to see her go to the guillotine . In her discharge they saw only another example of legal incompetence and governmental procrastination . Already the Duchesse de Praslin wore a martyr 's halo and was mourned as the victim of a husband 's infatuation for a clever and scheming rival . Everywhere wives and mothers denounced this " MademoiselleD. " and praised the dead Duchesse as a paragon of virtue , whose only fault had been to love her husband and children too well . " Let the women of France lay hands on this governess , " was the hue and cry in streets and shops and homes , " and then she would soon see how we feel about her . All those fine speeches of hers to the lawyers and Chancellor would be wasted on us . Let her suffer as she made another suffer . She has no right to go free ! " It was essential that her whereabouts be kept secret ; so only her few friends knew her hiding place . She must not go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . She must use an assumed name if she ventured beyond that loyal household . Although the subject of future plans had been carefullyavoided so far , it was plain to all that when she was able to resume her old occupation of teaching she could not do so in France , where the ghost of scandal would always follow her from post to post . She would never be free of it . A spying glance , a whispered word , an awkward question , and that shadow would fall upon her . She knew how it would be , though as yet she dared not speak of that to her generous hosts . No , her head did not ache . She was past all physical pain . All feeling had left her ; she was held fast in the grip of inertia . Once she had had courage to live and feel , once she had even had courageenough to die . But now life or death seemed immaterial . She continued to breathe ; to wake and sleep ; to eat and drinkP319what was set before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that was all . Whatever was put into her hands to do , she did with her old skill and efficiency . She helped about the house  --  sewing , dusting , copying sermons and letters for Monsieur Monod , hearing his children 's lessons . She was glad to make herself useful so long as nothing more was asked of her . She could even read those newspaper accounts of the Praslin case without flinching . They seemed not to concern her now , though the faces of the Duc and the Duchesse , of the old Marechal , and each of the children were as clear as if they still moved about her . Even now , nearly three months after that morning of August 18th , the ashes of that tragedy were being raked over and sifted by the press . She could scarcely pick up a paper without finding some reference to herself and the investigation , and alreadylegends were springing up . Workmen making repairs on the Due 's apartments in the chateau had discovered a fancy dress costume stuffed behind a loose piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn to a masquerade . The Duchesse 's maid had then recalled a dream her mistress had had earlier that summer . Madame had told her of it and of the frightening apparition of a devil all in red who had stood threateningly above her bed . She had screamed , and it had vanished . They had given the matterno further thought . But now it took on a sinister significance . Surely so macabre a premonition was more than a mere dream of the Duchesse . There were stories from Corsica of a gypsy warning that mentioned danger and blood , and as a bride Fanny Scbastiani had dared to wear pearls , defying the superstition that each pearl will mean tears shed in bitterness and grief later on . Henriette read these fantastic stories unmoved as she read the dead woman 's frenzied and pitiful outpourings in her published letters and journal : Do not be astonished , my dear Theobold , at my fear of being alone with you . We are separated forever  --  you said so ; a sad reflection that will ever be attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you refuse to let me share your confidences ?

I only wish to share completely your life , to embellishit , and to pour balm upon your wounds . . . . I will blindly obey you . I will no longer torment you by jealousy . You have deprived me of my children , and placed them in the care of a stranger who has usurped my place in your house . . .

What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached here I had hoped for peace , but the illusion did not last long . The carriage steps had not been let down before I saw in your icy , discontented air , in the constrained expression of the children 's faces , in those green eyes which appeared behind your shoulder , that I was about to be subjected to the most painful humiliation . . . . Mademoiselle D. must remain at all cost .... But why do you , who believe it so simple , so easy to replace a mother , think it so impossible to replace a governess ? If you had desired it , she might have been a good governess , but you have changed her functions , her position . . . . How is it possible that her head should not be turned when your conduct says to her every day , even more clearly than words : " I have a wife , but I prefer your society , your attentions . " . . .

Strange to know that the hand that had penned them would never be warm with love or hate again . Light was fading fast in the upper room . The words of the long columns of newspaper print grew dim before her eyes . Yet still she must read the words  --  her own repliesto the questions of the judges ; the Due 's last testimony ; and letter upon letter of the Duchesse . She could feel nothing as she read those wild and bitter words , though behind the type she could see clearly that familiar blue note paper with its family crest and the heavy , flowing pen strokes she had come to know and dread in the last six years . She remembered so well the firstP322note that had been addressed to her . She remembered how shocked she had been by the discarded one from which Rayiiald'sscissors had snipped a heart . She had felt guilty then to have such intimate revelations put into her hands , and now the whole world was reading them . A knock sounded on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down than usual , just the height of a child 's reach . She put the papers away and turned to greet ten-year-old TheodoreMonod . He carried a birdcage in one hand . " I 've brought my goldfinch to keep you company , " he announced , setting the cage carefully on the table . " I 'm sorry your head aches . " After she had thanked him for the loan of his bird , the boy stayed on , eyeing her in timid fascination . " You should put cologne on your forehead , " he told her . " I can get you some of Mamma 's . I know where she keeps it . " " No , thank you , Theodore , it 's not the kind of headache colognewould help . How did you get on at school today ? " Even in her state of apathy it was natural for her to take an interest in the child , who was only too eager to respond . He and his older sisters had already fallen under her spell , though they had received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did all my arithmetic right , " he assured her , " and the Professorread my composition about the shells to the class , the one you helped me with . But I failed in my Latin . The plural case is so hard . I had to stay after the rest and write Exeunt omnes a hundred times . Do you know what that means , Mademoiselle Desportes ? " " They all go out , ' " she translated . Then she turned from him with a catch of her breath . " Yes , I know what that means . " Presently Monsieur Monod himself appeared , and Theodore was sent downstairs . " I thought I should find him here . " Her host lingered after his son had gone . " You draw our young people like flies to a honey-P323pot , but you must n't let them impose upon you . My wife and I are sorry to hear you have another of these headaches . We had hoped we could count upon you to help us tonight . " " Tonight ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She had forgotten , and the mention of it only made her shake her head and beg leave to stay upstairs . " No one is coming who might annoy you , " Monsieur Monod persisted , studying her with anxious intentness in the failing light . " A few friends besides my brother Adolphe and his family . My niece has promised to sing , and we thought perhaps you might be willing to accompany her on the piano . " " Oh , Monsieur Monod , do not ask me to move among people yet . It 's too much for me . " He sighed and laid his hand persuasively on her shoulder . " The longer you postpone it , the harder it will be . You ca n't shut yourself away from people forever , you know . I realize it must be gradual , but you will not be subject to the curious tonight . These are friends who sympathize with you  --  " " Oh , but that 's it , " she broke in . " I ca n't face their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henriette ; you have need of all that is offered you . You were so brave during your ordeal , you ca n't afford to lose your courage now that 's over . " " I spent all I had , " she told him . " I 've no more courage in me . " " You underestimate yourself . I 've come to ask you as a favor to me , to join us and our guests this evening . " " I can hardly refuse when you put it so . I 'm under too great obligation to you and Madame Monod . But I wish I might be spared . " " If you want to leave after the music we shall understand ; but I hope you will feel like staying longer . There will be several Americans , and you know their usual difficulties with the language . Your English is so excellent it would be a comfort to rely on you to act as interpreter . The chances are , they will have noP324idea of your identity , and I shall not mention your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread introductions . " " Oh , but , Monsieur Monod , you do n't know  --  " " I know you will do your best . " He smiled encouragingly . " Remember , it 's no time to retreat when the battle 's won . " At the door , he turned and spoke again . " Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy does not concern us now . She belongs to the past . But I have great hopes for a certain MademoiselleDesportes . " When he had gone she sat a long time in the gathering darknessbefore she forced herself to light a lamp and lay out her clothes for the evening . She dreaded going to the wardrobe and bureau drawers , where each article she handled kept some painfulassociation . Memories clung to every fold and mocked her as she shook them out . Her linen still smelled of vervain from the chateau gardens . There was not a dress she owned which did not recall some remark of Louise or Berthe or Raynald , or the approvingglances of their father . In the little white jewelry box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamel pin which had been peace offerings from the Duchesse . The cameo brooch of Raynald 's choosing was there , too , with all its poignant memories . It had been mounted according to his own ideas , with his name and the date of his birthday engraved on the gold back . She turned it over and stared at those letters in the lamplight : " Raynald , June 18 , 1847 . " But even that failed to melt the ice at her heart . She moved in numbness to the wardrobe and selected her best dress , the moss-green moire with bands of russet and small bronze buttons that matched the slippers she took from their tissue-paper wrappings . How Louise had delighted in those bronze slippers the day she had borrowed them to dance the polka up and down the old schoolroom ! How gayly she had danced ! And now , where were those quick , light feet ? Were all those Praslin daughters dressed in mourning ? Were the clear eyes red with weeping shocked , incredulous tears , or clouded325with dumb bewilderment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and smile ? What of Raynald , sensitive and loving , who had shared his own birthday with Mademoiselle ? She would never know how they fared . She would never see them again . Better so , perhaps , since by now their minds and hearts must be poisoned against her . No , she could not have met disillusionment in those young eyes that had always turned to her in love and trust . " Exeunt omnnes , " she thought bitterly as she made her preparations . It was half past nine when she entered the large , old-fashioned salon where some eighteen or twenty guests had already gathered . She slipped in unobtrusively through the adjoining study and joined her host 's brother Adolphe and others whom she knew slightly . As she stood there , speaking of she scarcely knew what , she caught sight of herself in a long mirror and marveled that she should look much as she had looked when she had last worn the green moire six months before . She appeared somewhat paler and thinner , and her face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward changes she could find . Her hair still curled and shone on either side of its parting . Her brow was as smooth and unlined , her mouth wide and full-lipped as ever . How , she wondered , could it be that she bore no visible signs of inner blight ? People were being kind  --  far too kind , she decided after half an hour had passed . Their determined efforts to be casual embarrassedher more than all the curious scrutiny she had been subjected to in the Conciergerie . Those she knew greeted her cordially , but pointedly refrained from addressing her by name . They talked rapidly of the most inconsequential matters , and carefully avoided looking her full in the face . She understood the reason for their feigned indifference . She had often tried in the same fashion to disregard the sightless eye or scarred cheek of another . Never , she vowed to herself in the crowded room , would she be guilty of such obvious kindness again . Better to peer curi-P326ously at crippled infirmity or disfigured flesh ; better the frank stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief to turn her attention to the piano and the sheets of music spread in readiness on the rack . Fortunately the airs were familiar , since Madame Monod had lately prevailed upon her to play many of them for herself and her daughters . The young singer had a sweet , fresh voice ; and her manners were childlike and modest . She had no pretensions to soar to the heights of the Swedish nightingale , who had taken Europe by storm . She knew she was no future Jenny Lind , so she contented herself with pleasing her family and their friends and keeping on pitch without spectacular tremolos and trills . Henriette took her place on the bench grateful that the piano was placed so that her back was to the room which the singer faced . As her eyes followed the notes and her fingers moved over the keys , she forgot for a little the constraint that her presence had brought to that roomful of people . She had planned to make her escape after the musical interlude , but escape from the crowded room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one group , standing a little apart , as the guests from America . There were five of them , two women and three men , less stylishly dressed and assured of mannerthan their countrymen one saw in shops and on the boulevards . She knew she ought to join them and try to put them at their ease . But somehow , tonight , she did not feel equal to making an effort for these strangers . She felt even a sudden resentment that they should be there at all . Why had n't they stayed on the side of the Atlantic where they belonged ? Why must they come here in their queer-looking clothes , butchering the English language , probably , in their even queerer voices ? She wished they did not look so much like a flock of uneasy , disappointed birds of a feather , huddled on some alien bough . And then , without warning , one of them left the bough . He hurriedtowards her , his face beaming with frank , pleased curiosity , his eyes looking straight into her own with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even if there had been room to pass the groups of people , something about the eagerness in those eyes held her where she stood . She felt annoyed and furious and yet at the same time compelled to notice this young American who advanced upon her . She did not encourage him by so much as the flicker of an eyelash , but he still hurried on , a small , inconspicuous figure charged with excitement that fairly bristled under a poorly fitted coat the color of snuff . Now he was speaking at her elbow in a voice that surprised her by not being the nasal , high-pitched twang she had come to associate with Yankee visitors . " You are Mademoiselle Deluzy  --  Desportes , " he began without preliminaries . " I should have known you anywhere , even without the bonnet with the lilac trimmings . " Earlier that evening she had felt embarrassed by the tactful restraint of her acquaintances ; now she was experiencing the blunt frankness of an unknown young man . He could be hardly more than some student , to judge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . One expected a certain amount of crudity from Americans , but such blundering as this was too much to overlook . " I see , " she responded crisply , " that you read the newspapers . " Her shoulders lifted in a slight shrug , and there was an ironic edge to her words . But her disapproval made no impression on him . He continued to fix her intently with his candid blue eyes , oblivious to every one else in the room . " Why , yes , I do read the newspapers , " he admitted , and a sudden , disarming smile transformed the plainness of his face . " I can read French better than I 'll ever be able to speak it , I 'm afraid . The papers were full of you . I read every word , but they never told me all I wanted to know . You see , ever since I landed in France  --  " This was preposterous ! She would really have to snub him , even if he was an invited guest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips. 328 " It 's quite unnecessary to explain that you 've heard of nothing but the Praslin case since you came . Probably you know far more than I do about it . " " I know that you have been brave and steadfast under great misfortune ; that you met their attacks with honesty and eloquence . Is it any wonder then that you have  --  " " Please ! " Again she cut him short . " Please do n't say anything more . And now , if you will excuse me , I was just on the point of leaving . " But he did not stand aside politely . He actually came a step nearer to block her path of escape . " Oh , but you ca n't do that now ! " he went on , unaware that he had been dismissed . " I was going on to tell you that , ever since I landed , you have been so much on my mind . " " On your mind , monsieur  --  " He nodded an emphatic assent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and went on quickly  --  " I confess I see no reason why I should have been there . Have n't you Americans troubles enough of your own without crossing the sea to hunt clown more ? " " Yes , " he agreed simply , again ignoring her bitterness , " we have troubles of our own , as you say , but yours happen to be very important to me . That 's why , when I saw you in the Conciergeriecourtyard , and now tonight  --  " " You could n't resist satisfying your curiosity still further ! You thought a few questions more or less would n't matter after all those I 've had flung at me ! " She managed to keep her voice chill as an icicle , but she felt her cheeks flush in angry betrayal . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " if I have made you think that . I hoped when I heard you speak such fluent English that it would be easy to make myself clear . But that 's difficult sometimes in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that 's why I know they ca n't always be depended upon to say what we feel . " " You are a writer then ? " P329She might have guessed there was some such reason behind his persistence . A young newspaper man from America  --  probablyhe had been sending back reports of the investigation . Perhapshe meant to write the story of her life with embellishments of his own . The sooner she put a stop to that , the better . " Only in a way , " he was explaining . " I do write articles sometimes when I have time between my sermons . " " Sermons ? " It was her turn to stare curiously at the boyish face looking into hers . " You are a minister ! But , no , you ca n't be ! " " But I am , " he insisted with another smile . " It 's not necessary to look like an Old Testament prophet to preach the Gospel , is it ? " " No , " she was forced to admit . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to meet a minister like you . " " And I have never met any one like you  --  so there we are . " " You really preach sermons from a pulpit , " she repeated , eyeinghim half amused , half admiring . " It 's hard to believe that . You look too young . " " I 'm twenty-five , " he told her , " and I 've been preaching off and on for ten years . " " Oh , so they let children preach in America ? " " I was fifteen , " he explained patiently , " halfway through college . My father is a minister , too , so I suppose it comes naturally . But "  --  he turned to her again with that swift smile  --  " I 'll never forget that first experience . It was a little country church where students were often sent to preach . " " And what was the subject of your sermon ? " " On Christ throwing out the money changers from the Tent , pie . I thought when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I had n't made a very choice . But they did n't seem to mind about that , or my not having a robe . You see , " he went on confidentially , " my family were very poor , and I usually wore one of my brothers ' coats , and they are all much bigger than I. A cut-down roundabout hardly made me look im-P330pressive when I mounted to that pulpit . It did n't seem so difficult at the time , but that first sermon did age me . I know , because I had to pay full railway fare on the trip back , and they had let me ride for half-fare before ! " He looked so rueful over this early plight that she had to laugh in spite of herself . " Yes , " he said , studying her with even more pleased intentness than before , " I thought you would look like that when you smiled . " She made no reply , and he did not seam to expect one . Other people jostled at their elbows , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet together as if they had made an island for themselves in some hurrying human stream . Then it caught them up and whirled them apart once more . Marie and Albert Remey seized upon her , and presently she must go to help Madame Monod serve refreshments in the adjoiningroom . For the next hour Henriette had no chance to talk with the American , though she saw him now and again , watching her with that air of intimate expectancy which was so strangely disturbing . She wished that he would leave , as others were doing , but he lingered on , a small , determined figure on the fringes of animated groups of men and women . His quietness made him conspicuous by contrast , although he had so little physical presenceto boast of . Perhaps the fact that he did not gesticulate when he spoke , gave him a kind of dignity . Yet it was more than just that , she decided . At close range one might be deceived by plain features , a too naive eagerness of manner , or by the queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed his real proportions , as a certain mountain peak that has been indistinguishable among others will rise when viewed in true perspective . The artist in her recognized this , and the woman in her felt his integrity . He stood out in that gathering , not only because of a racial difference , but because of some inner simplicity and sureness of purpose which possessed him so completely that he was himself unaware of the power .   " No wonder , " she thought , smiling at the memory of his confession , " no wonder that first congregation of his did not dare to laugh . " She felt a touch of remorse , remembering how hostile she had been towards him , mistaking his honesty for crudeness , confusing his enthusiasm with effrontery . She need not have behaved so rudely , trying to snap his head off simply because her own nerves were on edge . But then , she was not used to the headlong exuberanceof visitors from America who could be almost indecently personal at first meeting . The company was thinning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room without much notice now . But there he was coming towards her again with that confident , bright look . She was sure he would outstay all the guests , for he seemed completely unaware of time despite the gold watch chain that flapped on his vest . " Now we can talk , " he began almost before he had reached her side . " I was growing impatient . You were so busy . Now tell me " But first you must tell me something , monsieur  --  your name . " " Field , " he said , " and you 'll find my first one simple  --  Henry . Then Martyn in the middle . " " Henri , " she repeated , " Henri , then Martyn in the middle  --  Field . " " They never made it sound like that at home , " he told her admiringly . " They would call you Henrietta over there . " " Field , " she thought . " I might have known it would be a short , plain name like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet full of living importance . " ) " I like your name , Monsieur Field , " she heard herself saying . " It seems right for you . " " It 's one of the few things my father thinks his sons should be proud of , " he told her . " We 're a fair-sized family , " he added . " I have two sisters and six brothers . " " Whose clothes you sometimes wear , " she prompted .   " Not since I left Williams College . " He laughed . " Yes , that 's the penalty of being the youngest and smallest son . I 'll tell you how our family goes : David Dudley , Emilia Ann , Timothy Beals , Matthew Dickinson , Jonathan Edwards , Stephen Johnson , Cyrus West , Henry Martyn , and Mary Elizabeth . " He had to pause for breath . " Do n't tell me any more names , " she begged . " Henri Martyn is all I can remember tonight . " " I shall be writing them about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail packet . " " Oh , but , please ! " she began , but she could not finish because the two Monod brothers joined them . " I 'm glad you brought me that letter of introduction . " Adolphe Monod spoke cordially to their guest . " We should have missed having you with us tonight . " " I would not have missed tonight for all the rest of my stay put together , and I 've been in England and Scotland , too . " " And you 're off to Brussels in the morning , I hear ? " " Yes , and then on to Germany and Austria , and perhaps as far as St. Petersburg if my money holds out . I 've been saving for this , these last five years . " " What globe-trotters you Americans seem to be ! " Frederic Monod smiled wonderingly and shook his head . " He must have been born with an itching foot . Do n't you think so , Henriette ? " " He must indeed , " she agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramping about and looking so tired and uncomfortable , what ever made them come so far . " " You should be able to answer that question for her , Monsieur Field . " " Well , it 's this way , I think . " He grew suddenly serious and pushed back a straight brown lock of hair that had fallen into his eyes . " For most of us one book is not enough to satisfy our minds , and so one life is not enough either . We want to experiencemore than can ever be crowded into seventy or even eighty years . I am too greedy , perhaps , but I want to catch at the mean-P333ing of different lives in different places . I want to find out what goes on under the thatched roofs of cottages and behind the walls of palaces and hotels . I want to walk in old ruins and in new cities . I want to watch people everywhere , whether I can understand the words they are saying or not . It is too much to ask , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and feel what they are feeling . " He broke off with a sigh . " Do you understand what I mean ? " " Yes . " Henriette spoke before either of the men had a chance to answer . " You 've made me understand . " " Some day you must put that all in a book , for those who travel and those who stay at home . " Frederic Monod spoke with approval . " Yes , Monsieur Field , " his brother Adolphe joined in . " You have a true passion for travel , so let us hope you will go far , in more ways than one . " As their visitor turned to leave with the last guests , Henrietta held out her hand to him . " I wish you a fortunate journey , " she said , " and a safe return . Good night . " After he had gone the brothers Monod spoke of him to Henriette . A most extraordinary young man , even for an American , they all decided . Perhaps a trifle too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The letters he had presented from friends across the Atlantic all praised his mind and character . They said he was considered a brilliant scholar , a particularly fine student of Greek and Hebrew and philosophy , and that he showed unusualpromise in the ministry . His family were of the best Puritanstock , although he certainly had nothing of Puritan coldness and constraint in his make-up . Yes , when one became used to his naive frankness of manner , one realized that he had a fine mind and largeness of sympathy , even a roughhewn sort of charm  --  did n't Henriette agree ? At all events she had been most kind to devote herself to putting him at his ease . They thanked her for the effort she had made , and hoped it had not been too tiring. 334As she climbed the stairs to her room she remembered the unabashedadmiration in the eyes of the little American . She had aroused his ardor and idealism , and such was the power of his belief that her sense of futility lifted a little . All these last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own making , to shut herself away where nothing could ever hurt her again as she had been hurt . Others had respected her wall ; even the considerate Monods had only rapped there discreetly . But he had known better . Walls were something to be scaled , and he had leaped over hers in a single bound.  |p335THE  CROWDING POLITICAL EVENTS of that winter of 1847 and 1848Hcnriette attached little significance to the Monod reception ; yet it marked a distinct transition in her life . She began to feel once more and to suffer as her numbed senses thawed . Shock and disaster had till then overwhelmed her almost completely ; but as strength returns to paralyzed limbs with sharp pin-pricks of pain , so even more cruel stabbings troubledher mind . Whether she woke or slept , she was beset by memories the more bitter because they had once been sweet . Everywhere they assailed her , whether she handled personal possessionsor turned some street corner that brought her face to face with the past . Without warning , ghosts would rise up from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shop window , a playbill announcing the great Rachel 's coming performances , the smell of roasting apples , the fragrance of a man 's cigar , children with eyes shining above parcel-filled arms , children singing carols , Notre Dame seen dimly through falling snow  --  she was at the mercy of them all . Some chance remark of Theodore Monod or his sisters could make her eyes film suddenly or her lips stiffen as the screws of memory tightened at her heart . A man 's tall figure swinging towards her with the long vigorous strides she had come to connect with the Duc could keep her trembling long after he had passed . Night after night , she dreamed that he was alive . It was all a mistake  --  this horror of blood and violence and disgrace that had seemed so real . Then she would wake , and truth would strip her of this brief comfort . She must lie chill and alone , rehearsing the tragedy against her will , ruthlessly recalling every step that had led on to disaster.  |p336He  is dead and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the rest of the song ? She racked her brain to remember . At last it came : At his head a grass-green turf , At his heels a stone . But , no , even that had been denied him . Somewhere he had been laid away in secret shame . They had not dared to put his name above that spot . She alone out of all the world did not hate or revile him . " We can only judge another , " she thought , " as that person affects us . " Whatever had been his passion and weakness , he had never meant to hurt her . Since the day of their first meeting , he had shown her only the best in himself . It was his right to ask that she remember him so . He had been loyal and generous to her always , and nothing should mar that memory . " I play a sorry part in all this . " Those final words he had spoken came back to her now , heavy with meaning . Only God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . She knew far less than God , but enough of the life that husband and wife had lived to keep her from passing judgment . She herself was alive . The law had freed her of those charges . But would she ever be able to free herself of his presence when for six years it had dominated her world ? She would never know now what he had felt for her . Perhaps it had been love , perhaps merely the need for sympathy of which she had been the human symbol . They had asked so little of each other , and yet that little had been too much . She had not belonged to his world , or he to hers . Some fierce current beyond their control had caught them up and swept them away to certain destruction . Why had she not broken away before they reached the precipice ? Why had she not heard the thunder of the rapids in time ? That was what shep337could never answer through those interminable nights and days . " If I lose my reason some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corsican sunshine against the blue curtain of sea , " you will know that scribbled words have driven me mad . " Calais  --  graven forever on an English Queen 's heart ; Waterloo , on Napoleon 's ; and on hers , Praslin . Time might blur that name as moss softens the inscriptions on old gravestones , but it had been cut there too deeply to be erased . The Monod brothers and their wives must have realized something of her state of mind , for they did not press her to personal confidences . They wisely refrained from advice giving , and kept her occupied as much as possible . The hours of copying sermons , helping with fine sewing and the children 's lessons , readingaloud , painting , and practicing served to fill part of the days . But her returning energies cried out for better fare . She needed hard , stimulating work as she had never needed it before , especiallynow that the Christmas holidays were over and the dark , short days of winter stretched bleakly ahead . The Remeys did all in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she could never enter those rooms withoutfresh reminders of the tragedy which had touched all their lives . Albert had secured a few scattered pupils , but times were bad for such work ; and he missed the security of his teaching post in the Faubourg-Saint-Honore . Henriette knew this , and it troubled her to see them anxiously counting every franc and sou . She saw Madame Le Maire sometimes , and though the old woman had recovered from her first hysterical denunciations on the morning of the murder , their meetings were too full of unspokenthoughts to be comfortable . Of all the little group there was only one with whom Henriettecould talk or keep silence with complete ease . With old Pierre , the porter , she found herself talking naturally of what she . could not mention to others . He had the simple directness of those who work with their hands , whose brains , uncluttered by learning , remain clear and shrewd . The stubborn devotion of anp338aging sheepdog looked at her out of his eyes , and more than once she unburdened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du Harlay . It was a cheap place , but the coffee was fresh and strong , and old Pierre could leave his post for half an hour of an afternoon to drink a cup with his favorite mademoiselle . " You 're fretting yourself to fiddlestrings , " he would say , peering at her disapprovingly over his lifted cup . " Did n't I tell you to get all the sleep you could ? " " Yes , you told me , Pierre , " she would admit , " hut that 's easier said than done . " " I know , mademoiselle , it 's hard when we have the black dog on our backs . " " The black dog ? " " It 's by way of saying everything troubles you . Yes , he sits heavy on all our backs sometimes ; but he will go away . By spring you will forget he was ever there . " " But spring is a long way off , Pierre . " " My knees have told me that already , " he would tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But no matter , spring will come , and it will bring you good things . I know it . " " Oh , Pierre , what good can it bring me after all that has happened ? You know there is nothing for me in Paris , or in France for that matter . " " Then you will have to travel across the water to find your good fortune , mademoiselle  --  as far as America , maybe . " She set her cup down and stared at his seamed old face . He must have read what was in her mind , though she had not spoken of it to another person . She had indeed hardly been willingto consider the idea consciously herself . " Whatever put America into your head ? " She tried to dismiss the subject . " Because it 's the place for you to go , " he insisted between gulps of coffee . " There 's trouble brewing in Paris . I can feel it , the way I feel a spell of bad weather in my knees while the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away like some rusty , rheumatic crow . " I , too , should go to America , " he continued . " Perhaps you will send for me when you have grown rich over there . " " But I tell you I have no intention of going to America ; and , if I had , why should you want to go there ? " " Well , I 'm an old dog that would be willing to learn new tricks , mademoiselle , new tricks in a new world  --  or perhaps even my old ones will pass for new over there . " He chuckled and dipped his brioche in the syrup at the bottom of his cup . " Put the ocean between yourself and this trouble you 've had , " he urged her . " Go while you 're still young . " " I 'm not so young any more , " she confessed , " and I 'll carry my trouble with me whether I go or stay . " But he shook his head as he rose to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , " he said . " Then you 'll have plenty of white to look forward to . Do n't forgetto save a crumb for me , mademoiselle . Au revoir . Madame has no doubt been shouting herself hoarse for me these last ten minutes . " She watched him hobble off towards the Rue du Harlay and sighed at the folly of an old man 's dreams of seeing a new world . But in February old Pierre 's predictions began to be shared by most of Paris . Trouble and tension gathered in the air . " Power , " said Wronger , " is a bell which prevents those who set it pealing from hearing any other sound . " So it was with King Louis-Philippe and his Minister of Foreign Affairs , Guizot . The sound of that bell whose clapper they had managed to keep in motion so long drowned out nearer and more ominous rumblings . " Enrichissez-vous , " it cried out mechanically with Guizot'sown self-assured voice , but even his bourgeois supporters were growing skeptical of the refrain . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political corruption , with steadily mounting taxes issued under the guise of false pros-perity ?  |p340The  Praslin murder case was not a closed issue . A peer of France had been allowed to evade justice , and that still rankled . It had put the match to public indignation , and once the blaze was started a score of other grievances caught fire . Few guessed , least of all the complacent , seventy-year-old monarch , how briskly the dead wood that had held the Empire together would burn . Rain had been falling for days ; and a thick , smoky fog hung over all Paris . It was the nand of February , and since early morningstreets had been either deserted or thronged with determined , rain-soaked people . Theodore Monod had been brought home from school at midday in charge of an older student . He reported that crowds had been thick about the Madeleine . Men in smocks and old coats , beggars and gamins and women , too , had been waiting for hours in the downpour , though no one seemed certain what they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and others had tried to sing the Girondist refrain of defiance . There had even been a bedraggled red flag or two hoisted above the heads , and one particularly ragged figure had worn a placard with something about the " right to work " in lettersthe rain had almost obliterated . Monsieur Monod confirmed his son 's report when he returned at twilight . " No one seems to know what is happening , " he answered his wife 's anxious questions . " But there has been fighting in the Champs Elysees . The Municipal Guard has come out in full force . I saw men burning benches in the streets and tearing down lamp posts . A man told me several shops had been looted . He said he saw one stripped of firearms . " " Then it must be Revolution . " Henriette heard herself speakingcalmly , almost as if she were making some comment on the weather . She did not realize the meaning of her words till she saw the color drain out of Madame Monod 's cheeks and lips , till she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in their faces , and suddenly that word had become a reality to them all.  |p341Troo|ps  were encamped round bonfires in the streets that night . Wet and shivering , the mobs scattered for shelter while the rain continued to fall in torrents . The easy-going old King reassured himself that the weather was on his side . The people of Paris , as he remarked to his household , were not accustomed to making revolutions in winter . But by another evening Louis-Philippe had grown less smug . Those hours of falling rain did not dampen the spirit of insurrection that charged all Paris . The crowds were sullen and dogged . Companies of students marched through the streets , denouncing Guizot with challenging cries : " Vive la reformelDown with Guizot ! Vive la Republique ! " The ministers and officials of France heard the shouting and waited tensely for Guizot to mount the rostrum and take his stand . It was half past one when he appeared , frail and precise and looking , as a foreign visitor described him , " a cross between a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his head high ; he kept his old impelling manner even though he announced his resignation . His words fell like lead on the shocked ears of his supporters . " We have been betrayed , " they cried . But the victorious Leftists cheered them down , and the crowds outsidehailed the news with transports of enthusiasm . " The Royalist Government has collapsed , " Frederic Monod reported to his household when he returned late that afternoon . " Guizot has resigned , and God knows who will be his successor . There 's been no violence yet , but the National Guard has been called out as well as the Municipal one . " " But the Citizen Militia hate the Municipal Guard , " Henriette broke in . " Does that mean there may be fighting ? " " I fear it . Already there is disorder among the regiments . " Few slept in Paris that night . Crowds gathered on the wet and wind-swept streets , ragged coats and military uniforms making strange human patterns under the flare of torches . At nine o'clock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was under heavy guard . But when the marchers advanced upon the gates they were metP342by crossed Layonets . A shot rang out , and others echoed in sharp metallic patter . By early morning there had been another massacre in the Place de la Concorde . Carts were parading the dead in improvised biers under slaty skies , followed by shouting , water-soaked companies of men and women . Fresh columns of soldiers were being sent out to restore order , but when they reached the Boulevard BonneNouvelleand other important arteries of the city , they found the way blocked by rough barricades of mud and stone that had been hurriedly thrown up in the night . Bedraggled red flags and equally limp banners of tricolor mingled as one company of soldiersafter another marched out , only to scatter uncertainly . Everywheremuskets were being reversed . Soldiers broke ranks and marched with the workingmen they had been sent to disperse . The Palace was in confusion . Without Guizot at his side , the King vacillated like a ship without a rudder . Orders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or repression  --  the King favored now one , now the other . It was as if , they said of him afterward , " he held out his right hand and shook his left fist . " There was no time to waste in argument if the Palais Bourbon was to hold its own against the rival government that was even then being formed in the Hotel de Ville . At eleven o'clock on the morning of February 24th , Louis-Philippe called his two sons and prepared to make his last royal appearance . Ile had decided upon a personal appeal to his subjects . He would review the National Troops on guard before the palace . They were a picked regiment of his Citizen Militia whose uniform he wore , and they represented the powerful bourgeoisie on whose support he had always relied . But that drizzling day , as he rode along their lines in the Carrousel , no spontaneous burst of cheers rose to greet him . Only a few half-hearted cries of " Vive le roil " answered his challenge . ' lie air was heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruptlyhe turned his horse back to the palace . An hour later theP343abdication had been signed ; he had exchanged his uniform for civilian dress and with his family had turned his back on a Paris that was no longer his capital . News of the abdication and the flight of the royal family was not generally known for some hours . In the region about the Monod home there had been less disturbance than on the day previous , and Henriette , grown restive from staying so long behindshuttered doors and windows , had ventured out upon an errand . Word had reached the household that a member of MonsieurMonod 's congregation was seriously ill and in need of help . The minister had left some hours before , and there was no way of reaching him ; so she had volunteered to go to the sick parishioner . It was out of the question for Madame Monod to leave her children , and besides Henriette rather relished the idea of leaving the house that had held them prisoners for two long , anxious days . " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled reassuringly from the door . " It seems quiet now , and the rain has stopped . " She reached the stricken home without difficulty , making her way there by back streets . The patient was very ill . She could do nothing beyond reassuring the family that Monsieur Monod would come when he could , and that Madame Monod sent her sympathy . But when she found herself on the street once more she could not resist returning by a different route . Streets and gutters were still wet , but the clouds had broken overhead . She turned towards the Champs Elysees and made her way along familiar streets . Here there was more activity . People passed her , all moving in the direction of the Tuileries , but in their own haste they took no notice of her , an inconspicuous woman in bonnet and shawl . It was only when she found her path blocked suddenly by a barricade of mud and cobblestones and a struggling mass of people that she regretted her rashness in choosing that way . Hastily she turned to retrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had closed in behind her . Too late she realized she wasP344caught fast between two groups that had met from opposite directions , and that were now mingling like a dark mass of gigantichuman bees driven out of a hive . There was nothing to do but keep from falling under the rush of trampling feet . It took all her strength to do that . She had no time to think or feel anythingexcept the immediate necessity not to lose her footing ; to hold her own among those swaying , heavy bodies . All her life , that next hour remained a confusion of sights and sounds and smells without semblance of reality . Sharp detached pictures remained with her always  --  more like the shifting patternsof a kaleidoscope held to her eyes than an actual scene of which she was part . " Vive la reforme ! Vive la Republique ! " voices were shouting all about her  --  men 's deep voices and the thinner cries of women . She had no breath to join in . The sound rolled over her head in dull thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick thud of hoofs on cobblestones . A company of soldiers bore down the street , and the crowd scattered in panic before the plunging hoofs and bared sabers . Henriette caught at an arm beside her to keep from falling as the soldiers clattered by . They passed so close that a clod of mud struck her cheek . The man she clung to was a workman . She felt the coarse cloth of his blouse under her fingers . Ills face was streaked with sweat and mud , and a gash showed over one eye . He cursed thickly and shook his fist at those riders in the uniform of the Municipal Guard . A woman 's scream shrilled out above the hoofbeats , and then the crowd closed in about a body that lay sprawled and limp where the riders had cut a path through the crowd . " Oh ! " Henriette gasped to those beside her . " Some one has been hurt , perhaps killed . We must stop . Let me get through . " But no one answered or moved to make way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirp protesting the roar of a waterfall . Up one street and across another to avoid more barricades , more crossed bayonets  --  it was as if an invisible flood were carry/guished himself ; he was not a coward and not entirely a fool , and his good humor gave him with his brother officers a certain not quite contemptuous popularity which made his promotions possible . Late in the war there were few enough men who could even dress a company , and so , after Atlanta , he became a brigadier . But after the war he was lost . He had never made decisions for himself ; his father , his wife , his superior officers or some able adjutant had always managed his life . Now , his fatherwas senile and bankrupt , the war was over , and his wife was dead . After the life of the state began to settle into order , and he began to recover from his personal confusion , he drifted into politics . Before the war he had had some political experience , and now it seemed the only occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large-molded good looks , and his military record would receive their proper reward . He was , within limits , successful . But he became steadily poorer , and steadily more contemptible in the eyes of ' his colleagues . There was money to be made in politics , crcn in obscure offices , but he was honest . While other men demanded money , or information by which money could be made , he demanded only flattery . His vote or influence could be had fiir that , and men knew it . Once his wife , willingly and capably , had managed his affairs . Then his daughter Lucy assumed the obligation . She was a poor manager , stubborn and pliable by turns , suspicious and trustful . In his many absences she tried to hold the farm together , but when he was at home she devoted all her energies to pleasing him . After her sister , Ruth , whom she considered a mere child , had eloped with an unknown and penniless young man from Arkansas , she increased the rigor of her devotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's marriage , GeneralBurnham was defeated for re-election and began to fail in health , her abnegation became almost complete . She rarely left his side . She read to him much , novels for the most part , butp223tried to keep the newspapers away from him for fear that they would upset him . She would bring flowers to him from the unworkedgarden by the house , and say , in the coaxing voice of one speaking to a child , See , papa , see , are n't they pretty this year ? ' Or she would comb and brush his luxuriant long hair , and stroke his fair , almost unseamed forehead , and pat his stillyellowmustaches . Then , sometimes , he would take her hands and , while she knelt beside him , hold them gently , and say in his vibrant , melancholy voice : I 've seen a great deal of the world , my chick . I 'm an old man , and I 've seen a great deal , pomp and circumstance and wealth and honor and valorous deeds , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a kind and loving heart is the greatest thing in the world . And you have a loving heart , my Lucy . ' At such a moment , so great was her joy , she felt repaid for everything . Her own youth was passing . Young men from the section had courted her , but one after another she had dismissed them . Their attentions had , at first , been pleasant and flattering to her , but she would say to herself , and to them , I must take care of papa ; not everyone has a papa like mine . ' But the feeling grew in her  --  and more rapidly and firmly after the ill-advisedmarriage of her sister  --  that all the young men were beneath her . Or , more accurately , that not one was worthy to be brought to papa as his son-in-law . After her sister died , down in Mississippi , and some church ladies down there wrote and inquiredif they should send the little child , she dismissed the last of the young men . She absorbed the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy-chair and the footstool of her father . The child was taught to tiptoe to the General and curtsy , and say in a small voice , I hope you are feeling better , Grandfather , ' and , I love you , Grandfather , ' and , Here is a rose I plucked for you , Grandfather . ' General Burnham was killed in an election-day quarrel on the streets of Bardsville . Although he had almost ceased to have anyp224meaning for the community , the dramatic circumstances of his death revived for a moment his vanished importance . His funeral was a public occasion . The pallbearers were , like the deceased , veterans of the war , and a Confederate flag covered the coffin . A volley was fired over the grave . While the echoes yet rang in the frosty air , Lucy Burnham , in a frenzy of grief , tore herself from the supporting arms of her friends , and was scarcely prevented from flinging herself into the grave . Percy Munn , then a boy just entering adolescence , heard the wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurching toward the open grave . He was to remember the moment , and much later was to try , puzzledly , to correlate its passion with the cold , trivial , foolish , and futile woman whom he grew to know . That day he also saw a motionless , thin little girl , some six or seven years old , whose face appeared to be molded of a scarcely tinted wax , and who stood near the grave but seemed to be aware of nothing around her . That was his first sight of May . When Miss Burnham recovered from the stupefying effects of her grief , she turned herself , grudgingly and almost resentfullyat first , to the care of her little niece . But the child was so gentle and tractable and aflfectionate that , more and more , she gave herself without reservations to her . One bright morning in early spring , a clear day that seemed in its softness of air and penetrating brilliance to promise , almost prematurely , the new season , she sat by an open window and brushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grate , the windowwas up , for the first time that year , and the fresh odor of the earth came into the room . Miss Burnham looked perturbedly out over the tumbled garden , where great brown spikes of weed stalk thrust up among the rosebushes and the knotted , leafless wistaria clutched and dragged down the rotted trellises , and out over the brown fields beyond , and then returned her attention to the child 's head , over which the sunlight spilled . Under that light the child 's long hair was a clear , luminous gold . Sud/denly Miss Burnham dropped the brush , and plunged her fingersinto the hair , as into a healing stream , and with tears on her cheeks , cried out : Oh , sweetheart , sweetheart , I 'll be so good to you . Make me be good to you , always ! ' Then she pressed the child to her bosom , and holding her with one arm , stroked again and again the golden hair , murmuring , Your hair , it 's just the color of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . ' The child became her whole life . Gradually , she paid less and less attention to the operation of the place . The negro hands and croppers would come up to the house to get directions or to ask a question , but she would let them stand around an hour , or two hours , while she bathed the child , or pressed a ribbon for her , or put ribbons on her hair . The men would lounge on the back porch , looking off across the yard or talking in low voices . Miss Lucy , she shore doan mind burnen the good Lawd 's daylight , she doan , now , ' they would say , laughing . After a while she would come out to them , with an artificial air of briskness and business , and with a temper that was ready , at the slightest provocation , to break into a flood of recriminations which they could not understand . She lost over half of the property . The house , a six-room , weatherboarded , one-story structure built around an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weatherboardingsagged loose to expose the old logs and chinking beneath ; some of the boards of the front steps rotted out ; in the front rooms , where the roof leaked worst , the plaster fell off in patches from the ceiling ; the last vestiges of paint disappeared from the exterior . But Miss Burnham , even though each year left her more threadbare and rusty in her black dresses , always found , somehow , the money to buy new clothes and ribbons for the child . And , as her house decayed and her own clothes grew more shabby , she became more vain and overbearing in her relations with her neighbors . She began to invent achievementsp226and honors for her father , but at first with such cunning , such casual references , and such diffident parryings of curiosity that they were accepted by all but the most wary . Then , as though emboldened by success , she enlarged the scope of her inventions and began to push back into an ever and ever more magnificent and fantastic history . Miss Burnham hated all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , always seemed to fix upon a cracked pane or threadbare patch of carpet or , even , upon her red , chapped hands . She hated them and was contemptuous of them , but she hated Percy Munn most of all . With her he was more polite and attentive than any of the others were , but he was also the most silent and watchful ; and , from the very first , she seemed to know that he was the one most to be feared , that he was the one who would take May from her . He married May after a courtship of two years . He could have married her earlier , but he wanted to establish his practice and to have a little money ahead . Almost as soon as he had returned from the honeymoon in Louisville , he sent men over to put a new roof on Miss Burnham 's house , and to paint it . He ordered them simply to go and begin work and to say , if questioned by her , that the matter had been entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious to them ; and she never mentioned the matter to Mr. Munn or , as far as he knew , to May . The roof and paint might , for all she showed , have come like a natural event , a rainstorm or the change of seasons . It 's sweet of you , Perse , ' May said , to be doing all that for Aunt Lucy . ' I hate to see property going to pieces , ' he answered . And anyway , the place 'll be yours some day , I reckon . ' It 'll make her so happy , having it fixed up , ' she declared . He did not tell May , however , that he had mortgaged some of his own land to buy the mortgage on Miss Burnham 's place . Nor did he ever discuss the matter with Miss Burnham . Hep227rarely saw her . May visited her often , but only occasionally could she be persuaded to come to the Munn place . Mr. Munn knew that she hated him , and that she would never forgive him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or saving her from eviction . And as he drove his buggy , that September morning , toward her place to talk to May and persuade her , if possible , to come back to him , he knew that Miss Burnham , no matter how the event turned out , would find in it a cause for new , and a fulfillment of old , hatred . He hitched his mare to a paling of the fence , tried the paling to discover that it had rotted loose , swore , and transferred the loop to another and more substantial paling . Then he walked toward the house between the lines of twisted , shaggy cedars . The negro woman who answered to his knock left him standing on the porch until she returned to announce , Miz Lucy say you kin go in the parler . ' He followed her into the hall and she pushed open a door to the left and stepped aside . It was Miss May I wanted to speak to , ' he said . Miz Lucy say she be here , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He entered the parlor , which was almost dark . The air in the room was cold and still , with a dusty odor . Without thinking , he moved toward the nearest window and stretched out his hand to part the curtains ; then he decided that it would be impertinent . He returned to the open space in the middle of the floor . The room was not very large . The two ponderous , glassfrontedbookcases , which rose to the ceiling , the chairs and the love-seats , the what-nots and the embroidered screens , the great cracked vases  --  these objects crowded around him in the gloom , weightily and oppressively . He stood in the midst of them , aware of the excited beating of his own heart , and breathed the odor of dust and horsehair . Miss Burnham was a long time in coming . She came at last ,  |p228moving  toward him with a skirring sound of her black-silk skirts and with her head bobbing nervously forward on her long neck as though in a scarcely restrained and irritable asseveration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she moved directly at him , as though she did not see him , or as though he were not there at all , and then stopped in front of him with the air of one who is startled at an obstruction . She said , Good morning , Mr. Munn . ' Her head continued to jerk slightly back and forth with a painful , mechanical motion , like a metronome asserting a rhythm that had nothing to do with the events about her . Good morning , ' Mr. Munn responded . She did not ask him to sit down , and made no motion toward a chair . She continued to stand directly in front of him . I 'm sorry to have troubled you , ' he apologized , after waiting . I reckon the girl did n't understand me . I asked if I could see May . ' She did not misunderstand you , ' Miss Burnham said . Well , ' Mr. Munn began , and hesitated . I do n't want to trouble you . I just wanted to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small regular jerking of her head , he continued : You know , we had a  --  a misunderstanding , and I wanted to talk to her . It 's not serious . That is , it should n't be That abstracted gaze and that movement of her head were unchanged . His voice trailed off . You may not see my niece , ' she affirmed . Is n't she here ? I thought ' She is here , ' Miss Burnham said . She is here ? ' But it is not possible for you to see her . ' It 's important , ' Mr. Munn asserted , his tone rising . I have to see her . ' No , ' she answered.  |p229I  beg your pardon . ' He took a step toward her , and she gave ground . I 've a right to see her . Every right . ' You have forfeited any right , ' she announced . I 've every right , ' he said . I want to see her . ' I should think shame would forbid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She brought her hands together in front of her and clenched them . Shame ' he began . Shame , ' she repeated . After what you did . To come here , after what you did , whatever it was . She wo n't tell me . Not a word . But she sat in a chair and cried , hour after hour , Mr. Percy Munn , that 's what she did , and that 's what you made her do , Mr. Percy Munn , and now you want to see her , you Is she sick ? ' he asked . It 's not your affair , but she lies there in bed , with her beautifulgolden hair out over the pillow , and the tears run down her cheeks . I 'd think you would sink through the floor with shame , Mr. Percy Munn , or put a bullet through your head . If I were a man I 'd do it for you . Like my father , the General . ' I want to see her , ' he said , somewhat abstractedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , but she blocked him , their bodies nearly touching . No ! ' she repeated , with a ring , almost of long-deferred joy , in her voice . I 'm going to see her , ' he insisted , and she put out her arms to bar the doorway . He seized her by the wrist . Even at the moment , he knew how ice-cold the flesh of her wrist was . Her whole body shook . Remember ! ' she exclaimed . Remember you 're a gentleman  --  if you are one ! ' He did not release her . Take your filthy hands off me , ' she said . Still , he did not release her . Instead , he looked into her face ,  |p230almost  with curiosity . He stared into her red-rimmed eyes and observed the feeble , frightening twitching of her head , and in a flash thought how easy it would be to knock that rotten old head in with one blow of his fist . One blow , like a rain-rotten melon . His grip tightened on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped his hand from her wrist . I 'll tell May , ' she said gaspingly , triumphantly , everything . ' All right . ' Everything , ' she reiterated , and you 'll never lay eyes on her again . ' He stood stock-still , looking at her . All right , ' he said . She stepped out into the hall , and pointed , quiveringly , toward the front door . Now get out ! ' she almost screamed . When he got home , he changed clothes , ate some cold food in the kitchen , went to the toolshed and got a cutting knife , and hurried down to the field . They were cutting the last field of tobacco now , not a field he had out on shares but part of his own crop . I le approached the men , said , hello , ' and began to work clown a row . The men , Mr. Grimes and two negroes , looked up to greet him soberly , then returned to their occupations . Mr. Munn felt the knife sink into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though by its own weight . Then he swung the blade and lopped off the heavy plant , just below . The blade of the knife was clean-looking and flashed in the sunlight . Now and then he paused to hold up a plant in both hands and feel its weight and look at it closely . It was going to be a fair crop , he thought again ; good considering the season , anyway . Then he would lay the plant by , to wilt out before it could be racked on its stick . Hit oughter weigh out pretty good , ' Mr. Grimes remarked , watching him inspect a plant . Looks like it , ' Mr. Munn answered , almost grudgingly . I 'm a-gitten on , ' Mr. Grimes said , straightening up . He wasp231a spare-made man , and the faded blue shirt hung loosely about his shoulders . His eyes were a pure , used-up blue , faded like the color of the shirt . He had long , ragged , reddish mustaches which wagged extravagantly when he spoke . A-Bitten on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen a lot of terbacker . Hit 's a-bout all I know , I reckin . And I seen a lot pore-er terbacker'n this-here in my time . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said . This patch of ground here '  --  and he moved his slow gaze up the slight rise , across the earth where nothing now showed but the blunt stobs  --  I alluz say , if n they ai n't but one hand of terbacker growed , hit 'll be growed here . I seen a lot of diff'rent places in my time , and I put a plow-point in a lot of diff'rent pieces of ground , but I say , let a man break ground along thisherecrick . Give God 's will and weather , and hit 'll git him a little somethen fer his sweat . ' It 's good enough ground , ' Mr. Munn agreed . He looked down at it , at his feet , as though discovering it . He laid the plant he held on the ground , with the other plants that were wilting there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armful of tobacco sticks . With a clatter he dropped the staves there between the rows , and began to rack up the plants alreadycut there . Mr. Munn bent to his task . He felt the sun on his back , even through his shirt , and on the back of his neck . He thought of the season 's changing , how it would be not so long , and took a relish in this last heat on his flesh . Yeah , ' Mr. Grimes said , goers on thirty-six years ago , I set a stand of terbacker in this selfsame field . Fer yore pappy . And hit made out a good crop . But I moved on . But I come back here twicet afore this-here present time . Hit looks lak a young feller Bits restless and moves on . No matter what kinder ground he 's got to work . Hit looks lak . ' I reckon so , ' Mr. Munn remarked , scarcely hearing , bending with the knife . P232Good ground , ' Mr. Grimes said . Hit gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife fell , and he seized the plant . Ter his sweat , ' Mr. Grimes repeated , if'n a man kin git a piece of money fer what hit makes . ' Mr. Munn straightened slowly up , holding the plant . By God , ' he declared deliberately , weighing the plant in his hands , by God , and this year we 'll get something . ' I done heared hit said afore , ' Mr. Grimes said . They finished the field , except for a few plants at the low end . One of the negroes was there , still cutting and laying the plants to wilt . They stood for a moment , Mr. Munn and Mr. Grimes and the other negro , looking back over the bare earth . The earth was reddish in color , and the stobs stuck up out of it , row after row . They racked up the last plants that were ready , and the negro climbed onto the wagon . The wagon moved slowly off across the field toward the barn , which stood at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , box-like form against the distant clarity of the horizon . Mr. Munn and Mr. Grimes began to walk after the wagon . Hit 's nigh all in now , ' Mr. Grimes remarked , looking over the empty field . Yes , ' Mr. Munn said , somewhat shortly . A powerful sight of terbacker , ' Mr. Grimes went on , done come off that-air ground , one time and anuther . I set terbackeron that-air ground afore you was born . Hit growed thar afore yore time , and afore mine . ' Mr. Munn did not answer . The two men walked along the edge of the field together until they came to a path that branched off across the pasture . Mr. Grimes hesitated . And hit 'll be a-growen thar when you and me is dead and gone to a better land , ' he declared . Good-bye , ' Mr. Munn said . Good-bye , ' Mr. Grimes replied , and started down the pathP233across the pasture . He walked with a high-shouldered , hunchingmovement , with his small head outthrust . Mr. Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , looked back , and saw that Mr. Grimes was gone . He had reached his shack , which stood by a single big tree on the other side of the pasture , and had gone in . When he turned around and started across the barn lot , he saw a negro man approaching him . It was Old Mac . They 's somebody at the house fer you , ' Old Mac announced . Who is it ? ' Mr. Bill Christian , ' Old Mac told him , and anuther gem-mun . ' Mr. Munn quickened his pace . You do n't know who ? ' Hit 's a red-headed gemmun , ' Old Mac said . His head , you mought say hit incline to red . ' Mr. Munn , almost running , went toward the house . He slammed the back door , went through the kitchen , and down the hall , calling out . Mr. Christian and Doctor MacDonald stood in the yard underthe maple trees . Mr. Munn ran out to them , with his hand stretched out . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt a sudden and unexpected surge of pleasure , of relief , as at hard-won safety . By God ! ' Mr. Christian shouted , where you been keeping yourself ? ' Mr. Munn hesitated , as though embarrassed . Hanging round the place , ' he answered . By God , ' Mr. Christian said , I just figgered I 'd come over and see how you was making it . Cap'n Todd 's boy , he 's over courting Sukie so much I just could n't stand to watch it . He 's a good boy , but God-a-mighty , the calf eyes he makes , it makes a man want to puke . I just said , hell , I 'll go over and see Perse ' That 's fine , ' Mr. Munn declared , that 's fine ! ' P234Mr . Christian gestured toward Doctor MacDonald : And just run into the doc , here , in town  --  did n't I , doc ?  --  and I just thought I 'd bring him along . ' That 's fine , ' Mr. Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to come . But he was glad . Sure , ' Doctor MacDonald said . You 'll stay to supper , ' Mr. Munn invited , then urgingly , sure , you 'll stay . I 'll tell them to put plates on . May '  --  he paused , then gathered himself and continued quickly  --  she 's not here right now , but you 'll stay . ' The two men looked at each other , then back at Mr. Munn . Fine , ' Mr. Christian said , and Doctor MacDonald grinned and nodded . Finished your cutting ? ' Mr. Christian asked , as they walked toward the house . Mr. Munn said that he had finished , or just about . I 've finished and started firing , ' Mr. Christian said , and it looks pretty good , for the most part . By God , I 'm just gon na set back for a spell now . That 's a last . I 'm gon na do me some hunting this fall if it 's the last tiling I do . 1 dunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I seen a passel of birds over on my place , a passel of ' elm You , Terse , you 'll have to come over and hunt some with me . We ai n't done any hunting in a long time . And I got me a couple as good coon dogs as you ever laid eyes on . You just come on over and fix to stay a while -- That 's fine , ' Mr. Munn said , and Mr. Christian laid his heavy hand on his shoulder . They sat around the table in the shadowy dining-room and ate the steaming food . They ate fried ham and chicken and mashed potatoes and late snaps and squash , and hot bread , and then pie and coffee . Mr. Christian leaned over his food and his bald head gleamed subduedly in the lamplight . His big jaws worked smoothly and powerfully . He said , Now , Perse , I 'm a man as shore-God likes good vittles . ' P235After they had finished eating they sat around the table and talked and smoked . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , his tone controlled and easy , I saw by the paper this morning they found that fellow Trevel-yan . ' Mr. Munn made a sharp intake of breath . Yes ? ' he said . Yes , ' Doctor MacDonald answered , and paused to inspect the tamping of tobacco in his pipe . Then he raised his eyes suddenly to gaze straight across at Mr. Munn . Yes , ' he repeated , they found him . Some kids out prowling round with their .22 'S looked down in the old quarry . They saw him caught in the cat-tails . ' Mr. Munn 's hands were gripping the edge of the table . They ran all the way to town , ' Doctor MacDonald went on . No one spoke for a minute . Doctor MacDonald continued to gaze straight across the lighted area of white tablecloth at Mr. Munn 's face . Mr. Christian scraped his chair back a little . Terse , ' he demanded , you got any more coffee ? ' Mr. Munn went to the door to the pantry and called for another cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat . The negro woman brought the coffee and , at a gesture from Mr. Munn , set it before Mr. Christian . Mr. Christian took a long draught of it , then set the cup down clatteringly . He said : Terse , when you gon na come out and hunt birds with me , huh ? You 're coming soon , ai n't you ? When the season opens up ? ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn answered . You better come soon , now . Yeah , you come out , and we 'll crack down on them birds , now . ' Yes . ' And that Miss Sukie Perkins I got , she 's shore as smart a coon dog as you ever laid eyes on . '  |p236HE  WOULD lie in the big bed in the dark and listen to the obscurenight noises or to the distant howling of a hound , or for the creak of one of the old boards under the pressure of a foot , and wait for her to come . The latch on the door would lift slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bar was finally released from its bracket , and the door , white in the shadowy room , would begin to swing stealthily inward . The heavy door moved softly and evenly now , but the first time she came to the room , he had been wakened from a half drowse by the squeal of the hinges as the door swung inward . He had risen up in bed , ready , before seeing the uplifted hand , to call out in his surprise . Later , she had oiled the hinges . The door did n't screak tonight , did it ? ' she had demanded , putting her head down on his shoulder so that the breath of her whispered utterance was against his ear . No , it did n't , ' he had said , and then remembered that it had made no noise . At the time he had not noticed , being so engrossedwith his eagerness , waiting to see if she would appear . I fixed it , ' she had told him . Do n't blow in my ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had whispered . I put some of papa 's gun oil on them . When you all were out hunting this afternoon . Do n't you think I 'm smart ? ' Yes . ' Well , why do n't you thank me ? Maybe I saved your life . Maybe papa wo n't hear that door now , and shoot you . ' He probably would , ' he had said.  |p237Are  n't you going to thank me , ' she had demanded , for fixing it ? ' I 'm going to fix you if you do n't stop tickling my ear , ' he had answered . Then she had set her teeth , not gently , in the lobe of his ear . Damn it , Sukie , ' he had said , and holding her hair twisted in his hand so that she could not lift her head from the pillow , had kissed her on the mouth . But the hinges worked silently now , not like that first time . The door would swing gently , carefully , open , and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her lips in mock warning while she pushed the door shut and lowered the latch into place . Sometimes , when there was no moon , it would be so dark that he could scarcely make out her shadowy form there against the white blur of the door , but he would know exactly how she would be , standing there , and would smile answeringly as though she could see his face . When the door was latched , she would move quickly across the room toward him , her kimono fluttering with her motion . She would shiver with the chill , for there was rarely a fire in the room , or would pretend to shiver , and standing by the bed to pull off the kimono , would say , Get over , I want the warm place , I 'm freezing to death . ' Then she would pull the covers about her , and shiver , and pretend that her teeth were chattering , and thrust her cold feet against his . Take them off , ' he would whisper . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death coming inch by inch down that hall  --  I almost catch pneumonia  --  all on account of your baser nature  --  and you wo n't even warm my feet  --  you dog You 've got a baser nature , yourself . ' No  --  no '  --  chatteringly  --  not  --  right  --  now . ' Now she would shut the door and run quickly to the bed , her kimono fluttering , but the first time , having forestalled his halfawakeexclamation by her lifted hand and having closed the door upon its creaking hinges , she had moved , almost with anp238air of deliberation , toward him , and had leaned over and taken his head between her hands and had kissed him . That had been the first time they had ever kissed . Then , standing there by the bed , in the frosty air , she had drawn his head against her , and he had heard her heart knocking strongly and surely under the curved ribs . After the first shock of surprise , when he saw her standing insidethe door with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never talked about themselves , or their feelings . They had not been together very often . Now and then they had sat before the fire in the living-room , in the evening , with Mr. Christian , and perhaps Benton Todd , engaged in a comfortable , desultory conversation until the time when Benton Todd , looking at his watch , would remark , It 's getting on , I better be going , ' and Mr. Christian , getting to his feet and stretching his big arms upward , would say : Well , boy , I guess I 'll be turning in . You folks , too , I reckon ? ' And once she had gone out with them to hunt quail . She had worn a red sweater and an old coat of her father 's , and he had watched her moving slowly through the tall , sun-goldened sage grass behind the careful , eager setters . They had scarcely ever been alone together . But that particular afternoon she had brought him out from town in her buggy . Waiting at the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town the next morning and so could bring him in , he had been surprised to see Lucille Christian drive up . Papa had some things to see about , ' she had explained , and he had to stay out at the place . So I came in to do the errands . ' Then she had added , And get you . ' That 's fine , ' he had said , climbing into the buggy . They had talked briskly and aimlessly while the buggy moved down the streets of Bardsville . After the downtown streets where the stores were , where people walked about , quickly now , for the day was cold , there were the streets with white , woodenP239houses set well back on lawns now brown , behind the bare , black-trunked maples . Those streets were deserted , except for a few children , well muffled in coats and stocking caps , who ran across the lawns and kicked the brown fallen leaves and uttered shrill cries that had no meaning . Otherwise , life seemed to have withdrawn deeply and secretly within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond . They passed the last houses , and were between the open fields . Mr. Munn raised his head to scan the sky . It 's funny , ' he said , but in town , you know , you do n't notice much what the weather 's like . ' There 're a lot of things you do n't notice in town , ' she returned . He continued to look at the sky , which showed no sun , and at the lead-colored horizon . What ? ' he asked . Oh , ' she answered , yourself , for instance . ' Yourself ? ' He looked directly at her , but she did not meet his gaze . Yes , yourself . ' She looked up the road , over the horse 's head . Then she continued : Yes , when I was in St. Louis , all that time , I did n't know a bit what I was like , really . I never noticed myself . I did things , and I never knew why . ' Not often , any place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , ' Mr. Munn said . Then : Not often , but sometimes , by God . ' I never was , ' she told him , before . ' Are you now ? ' Surer , ' she replied . Now . ' They fell silent for a few minutes , looking at the fields and the distant woods . Then she asked , Are you ? ' Am I what ? ' He knew what she meant , but like a man who plays for time , he parried the question . Sure , ' she said . Not always . '  |p240I  thought you were , always . ' Why ? ' he demanded . She paused , then went on : Because you look that way . The way you move . The way you say something . You say it like you were sure . And what you 've done . ' What have I done ? ' She continued to look up the road . Oh , nothing , that is , not any one thing , ' she replied , not any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , I do n't know , ' he said . Oh , just everything . And I 'm not the only person feels that . Other people do , too . They have the same impression . ' I reckon nobody 's sure most of the time , ' he rejoined . The landscape about them was very empty , and the sky . The bare fields , corn stubble , tobacco stobs , or brown pasture , lay along the road ; along the fencerows the trees were leafless now ; the woods along the horizon looked blue and smoky . The horse 's hoofs made a hard , chipping sound on the pike . Once or twice they heard a crow cawing from somewhere back in the fcnccrows . They met no one on the road . After a long silence , she said , If you 're chilly , you 'll find a laprobe in the back . ' Are you ? ' Not really , ' she answered . I 'm not , either , ' he asserted , or not very . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the reins , and he spread the robe across her knees and drew it up to her waist . At that moment , she turned her head and looked him directly in the eyes . Thank you , ' she said . That night she had come to his room , for the first time . She was , it seemed to him , two persons . There was the person who came to his room , and stood with one finger to her lips while she gently pushed the shadowy white door shut behind her ; and there was the person whom he saw moving about theP241house in the daytime , talking casually and easily to him or to her father or to Benton Todd , or humming a tune under her breath . The two persons seemed quite distinct to him . With the first were associated all the small night noises , melancholy , exciting , and insidious , which worked upon his consciousness while he lay waiting for her , sometimes in vain , and staring at the door , or while she lay beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall , the hoot of an owl in the woods or the distant barking of a dog , very faint and hollow , the unnamable , hushed creakings of old joists and beams . With that person he talked only in whispers , for if his voice rose she would reach to lay a finger on his lips and say , Shh ! ' Once he said to her , You know , you 're almost like two people to me . ' Yes , ' she replied . The one who 's here right now , and that other one I just see around but never really talk to . ' It 's hard to just be one person , ' she observed . They fell silent for a while , then later , as though there had been no interruptingsilence , she said : I love papa , and if he knew about this it would almost kill him , I know . And I love you . You see how it is . ' He said nothing , listening to her breathing in the stillness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If everything , everything you were and wanted and owed to people  --  everything  --  matched up just once , even for just a minute so you were really one person , completely , then you would be almost too happy to live . ' I reckon so , ' he said . It would be like when you love somebody , and are in their arms , like that very instant , only more . ' Then , after a moment : ' But , you do n't know you are you then . You just know you are . ' He said , If everything matched up , completely , maybe it would be the same way , maybe you would n't know you are you , the way it is now . ' P242No , ' she replied , I 'm sure you would n't know . ' She seemed to him to be two persons , but sometimes , about the place in the daytime , or when all of them were together , some gesture or inflection or passing expression of her face would suddenly blur the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply at her . Then , in an instant , the two identitieswould again be distinct , and there before him would be the girl who was cool and friendly with him and made jokes with her father and moved so casually and competently about the place , running the house , leaning with flushed cheeks over a boiling pot , carrying out a basin of feed for the chickens and calling , Chick ! chee  --  che-che-chick , chick ! ' That was the person who belonged to the daytime , to the cheerful , common sound of pans and pots rattling , to the clack of Mr. Christian 's boot heels on the doorsill and to his amiable , demanding bellow , Hey , Sukic , where are you ? ' and to Benton Todd . Benton Todd was in love with her , very obviously , Mr. Munn could see . Mr. Christian , that day when he had come to the Munn place with Doctor MacDonald , had said he could n't stand to hang around and watch Benton Todd 's calf eyes . Hem had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came to the Christian place , would follow Lucille Christian around the house while she was occupied , or pretended to be occupied , with her tasks . She would go out to see that the evening'smilk was properly put away , or that a basket of eggs was ready to be carried in to town early the next morning , or to help with cooking the supper . You can come on , ' she would say to Benton Todd , if you want to , ' and he would follow her . She would give him things to hold , pans or baskets or dish towels , thrusting them suddenly at him and saying cheerfully , Here , Bent , just hold this a minute , will you , please ? ' Then , as likely as not , she would go off and leave him standing with the basket of eggs or the damp towel ; or he might follow her about , still faithfully carrying the object . P243If he could not be with Lucille Christian he would seek out Mr. Munn and ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Munn thought about some case he remembered from his law reading at school , or about some detail of the management of the Tobacco Association , or about some matter of politics , the chances of Senator Tolliver 's election . If he 's elected , ' Mr. Christian had once said , overhearing Benton Todd 's question to Mr. Munn , and raising his head from his newspaper , if he 's elected , by God , he 'll never sit in the Senate . I 'll twist his durn head off his neck --  ' And there had been the ripping sound of the newspaper being pulled apart in his hands . Then he had added , With my own hands . ' More and more the very sight of Benton Todd grew to irritateMr . Munn . He was a nice boy , Mr. Munn was sure of that , and smart enough , but Mr. Munn blamed his youth , his innocence , and his apparent conviction that you could just go out and set everything right because you were right . His constant questions , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Mr. Munn 's feelings like a reproach , like an unjustaccusation from a trusted friend . But when he saw the boy following Lucille Christian about the house , trying to talk to her as she whisked busily and , Mr. Munn was sure , unnecessarilyfrom room to room , or saw him standing alone , trustingly and somewhat ridiculously , in the middle of the floor where she had left him , with a basket or a pan dangling in his large grasp , he was tempted to stamp out of the house or to protest , to demandwhy in the world she treated the boy that way , why did n't she send him about his business if she did n't love him . What do you let him hang round for ? ' Mr. Munn demanded of her one night , when she lay beside him in the dark . They had been silent for a long time , staring up at the ceiling . Shh ! ' she said , and laid a finger on his lips . Do n't yell . You 'll wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you let him hang round for ? ' Mr. Munn whispered.  |p244Who  ? ' she asked , still keeping her finger lying lightly on his lips and with it tracing their contours . You know who , ' he said  --  Benton Todd . ' I told him to go away , ' she whispered . Well , he has n't gone . ' You 're jealous , ' she murmured , and patted his lips with her finger . God , no , I 'm not jealous , ' he said . Yes , jealous . You 're jealous , and he 's just a kid . And your greatest admirer , too . Why , mention your name and he 's ready to get on his knees ; he thinks you hung the moon . ' I 'm not jealous , ' Mr. Munn said deliberately , but it 's not fair to him . I do n't like to see him standing round holding some damned thing in his hand and looking like he did n't know how it got there . ' You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , retorted . If he were n't around I might get you to hold things for mc . ' That 's not very probable . ' I ' 11 bet it 's not very probable , ' she said , but it 's not very sweet and polite of you to say so . ' They were silent for a time . Her finger remained on his lips . Now and then she moved it a little , parting his lips very lightly . It 's not fair to him , ' Mr. Munn whispered . Shh , ' she urged , and pressed his lips , although he had only whispered . It 's not , ' Mr. Munn repeated . He hesitated : Unless , of course , you do intend to marry him . ' She giggled softly . Then she said , My , my , Mr. Munn , what high ground you take ! ' And she giggled again . Then she stopped suddenly , withdrew her finger from his lips , and remarked , What a pretty picture you paint of everything . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p245I  did n't mean that , ' he whispered , you know -- A really good woman , ' she said , would be so insulted she 'd jump right out of this bed and go in the other room . ' She stopped for a moment . But I 'm not going to , ' she added . It 's too cold . ' Certainly , Benton Todd was decent enough , and Mr. Munn liked him . Only when Mr. Munn was out at the Christian place did that irritation overpower his ordinary feeling for the boy . Mixed with his liking for Benton Todd there was a certain sense of guilt . The boy had no business mixed up with the Brotherhood for Protection and Control , Mr. Munn was sure , and he felt , obscurely , a responsibility for the boy 's joining . It was that damned simple-minded , hero-worshiping streak in him , Mr. Munn thought , and was uncomfortable that he himself was the object of Benton Todd 's admiration . Now the boy was riding around the country at night , likely to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . But Lucille Christian would have to take some of the responsibility , too , he felt . He had felt that for a long time before he was able to see the whole picture . At first he had thought that Benton Todd joined just because he guessed the girl 's sympathies to lie that way , or because he wanted to swagger a little before her and drop dark hints . Then Mr. Munn had decided that Lucille Christian had let slip , somehow , the information that he and Mr. Christian were in the thing . Or perhaps she had come right out with it , either because she was worried about it or because she wanted the boy to get in . But Mr. Munn did n't know positively how much she knew . He discovered that she knew everything , and had known everything for a long time . One evening when Mr. Munn was there for supper , Mr. Christian looked up from his plate and remarked : Well , Sukie , you better get Aunt Cassie to sleep up here tomorrow night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won'tp246get in till mighty late . Like as not I wo n't get in till day . ' All right , ' she said . Mr. Christian turned to Mr. Munn . Say , Perse , do n't you want to come ? Tom Abernathy 's got two new dogs he claims are mighty good , and we 're gon na try ' em out . ' I 've got some things to see to out at the place , ' Mr. Munn answered . I 'm sorry . ' Tomorrow night 's Saturday night , you can catch up on your sleep Sunday morning . Why do n't you come , huh ? ' Lucille Christian , Mr. Munn noticed , was looking halfamusedlyfrom one to the other . Ca n't do it , ' Mr. Munn said . Why do n't you all stop pretending ? ' Lucille Christian asked , so casually that at first Mr. Munn did not grasp the full significance . Huh ? ' Mr. Christian demanded . You 're not fooling anybody , ' she said . Why do n't you stop ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told her father , and laughed . You 're not any more going possum-hunting than you 're going to fly to the moon . ' Mr. Christian held his fork in mid-air , a slice of ham impaled upon it , and stared at his daughter . She was smiling at him . You 're both dirty , low-down , plant-bed-scraping , barnburningnight riders . And then you lie to me about it . That '  --  and she took a sip of coffee and with a judicial air set the cup down  --  makes it worse . ' Now see here , Sukie ' Mr. Christian began . Yes , papa ? ' she inquired smilingly , as though nothing had happened . Now see here . You do n't know a thing . Not a thing . YouI 'd be silly if I did n't , ' she said . Everybody else does . I bet half the people in the county could just offhand name yotip247twenty-five apiece of the members of whatever high-falutin thing it is you call yourselves . And half of those would name both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perse . ' Yeah , yeah , ' Mr. Christian returned , and if all that 's true , how come the sheriff has n't been out here long ago to get me ? And get Perse , huh ? ' Scared , ' she said , and took another sip of coffee . Plain scared . ' She set the cup down , smiled brightly at them both . He knows that just as soon as you all got put in his jail , a lot of your little playmates would come and take his pleasant little jail apart . ' Then she added , And take him apart , too , maybe . ' You do n't know a thing , ' Mr. Christian said sourly . I know they could n't get those men over in Hunter County convicted this fall . After they arrested them . Everybody said the jury was full of night riders . ' Talk , ' Mr. Christian declared , just talk . ' She addressed herself to Mr. Munn : Wo n't you have some pickled peaches ? ' And she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : Why do n't you admit it , papa ? I know all about it , anyway . ' You do n't understand . Not a thing . ' It 's plain , anyway , ' she retorted , and laughed . I do n't mind . I really do n't . That is , if it 's what you 've got to do . ' She turned serious , and looked directly at her father , whose heavy fist lay on the table with the fork it clutched pointing upward . It 's not a thing for womenfolks to be messing in , ' he told her . I do n't mind about you , ' she said . If I were a man , I 'd probably be in myself . ' Mr. Munn looked soberly across the table at her . The lamplightfalling on her face made the flesh take a golden tinge . He knew that her eyes were blue , but in that light he could not really make out their color , they appeared so dark and deep . If you were in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty . '  |p248I  would n't expect to , ' she returned . I 'm not a child . ' Pretty ! ' Mr. Christian exclaimed , and the haft of the fork he clutched struck hard on the table . Well , it ai n't very pretty either that it 's been ten years since tobacco got a fair price , and the land in this section 's all mortgaged , and half the folks nigh starving . I 'd do anything I could lay my hand to . Before God I would , and I do n't care who knows it ! ' He scraped his chair back , and rose abruptly to his feet . He said , There comes a time . ' Sit down , papa , ' Lucille Christian commanded in a different , and quiet , voice . Sit down , and finish your coffee . I know . ' He sank slowly back into his chair . During the rest of the meal he did not speak another word . Then , afterward , he said that if he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to bed , and clumped upstairs . Mr. Munn and his daughter had followed him into the hall , where he picked up the lamp he would carry up with him . As he mounted the stairs , his posture seemed a little like that of an ageing man . Or perhaps , Mr. Norm thought , it was a trick of the light . He watched Mr. Christian all the way up and out of sight . The shadow cast by the lamp Mr. Christian held moved up the wall beside him , enormous , swaying and bouncing with a soundless and free elasticity as though by its efforts it dragged the man upward , like a dead weight . When Mr. Christian had disappeared beyond the head of the stairs , Mr. Munn turned to the girl . Did you get Benton Todd into the night riders ? ' he demanded . No , ' she answered thoughtfully , studying his face . You did n't tell him about your father being in ? Or me ? ' He 's not a fool , ' she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why should n't he ? He was around here a lot . And was here nights when you all were off riding . ' Did he ask you about it ? ' Yes , but I lied to him . I told him I did n't know anything . '  |p249You  did n't get him into the night riders ? You did n't encouragehim ? ' Mr. Munn demanded , leaning toward her . No , ' she said . I tried to keep him out . ' Why ? ' His father , ' she replied . On account of his father . He 's a nice old man , and papa likes him so much , you know , and he 'd resigned from the board , and all . If he ever found out Benton was in the night riders , you know how it would be . ' Is that all ? ' Well ' and she hesitated . Then : He 's not much better than a boy . ' He 's old as you are , ' Mr. Munn said . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , ' he insisted . People are different , ' she said . You know that . ' That was the reason ? ' Yes , ' she answered . He leaned over , slowly , and kissed her . That was one of the moments when the two persons she seemed to him , bafflingly , to be were merged into a single identity . He put his arm around her shoulders , and standing in the unsure light which the lamp gave , with the table cluttered with the dirty dishes behind him , beyond the open door of the dining-room , and with his gaze fixed on the blank wall , he was filled with a joy and certainty which seemed to him , at the moment , final . Good Lord ! ' she said suddenly , and stepped back from his embrace . Suppose Martha 'd come in to get the dishes and see us . ' Suppose , ' he repeated , with an inflection that made her look questioningly at him . Well , it would be a pickle , ' she observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sure , ' she said , but you do n't have to have that expression on your face , ' and laughed . Besides '  --  and she paused , and re/garded him amusedly  --  if you 'll get it off , I might come down to see you tonight . Even if I do freeze to death getting there . ' That 's not the point , ' he replied . Gratitude '  --  she gave a mock sigh and shook her head deprecatorily at an imaginary audience  --  gratitude and chivalry for you . ' That 's not what I meant , ' he said . He did not know exactly what he had meant . Those two identities which had seemed to merge at the moment when he leaned toward her and kissed her were now quite separate . Again , as before , there were the two people , the one who made jokes with her father and hummed aimless snatches of songs and moved about the household occupations with heels tapping briskly and cheerfully on the expanses of bare board , and the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white door , with her finger to her lips , and then approach his , bed . He shook his head . What 's the matter ? ' she demanded . Nothing , ' he said . But there is . ' Do you love me ? ' he asked . The negro woman entered the dining-room and began , clatteringly , to stack up the dishes . Yes , ' she answered . Will you marry me ? ' he said . Shh , ' she cautioned , her fingers to her lips warningly , and motioned with her head toward the negro woman in the diningroom . Will you marry me ? ' he repeated , his voice the same as before . Maybe , ' she said , but not if you bellow . You 're worse than papa . ' He had asked her that question before , and every time she had answered it evasively . But he had not mentioned the matter to her for some weeks now . He had begun to learn top251accept the situation as it was , as she apparently accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But he had only begun to learn , for sometimes , still , when she was lying beside him , or when she was with other people and he caught a sudden inflection of her voice or gesture , or even when he was alone and remembered , as with a stab of surprise , how different his life was from what it had been not long before or from what he had ever guessed it would be , he experienced that appetite for definition , for certainty , that would seize on her promise as on a symbol for everything it demanded . Or rather , in trying to extract her promise , he was like a man who tries to find in the flux and confusion of data some point of reference , no matterhow arbitrary , some hypothesis , on which he can base his calculations . But she would promise nothing . Now he had not tried to make her promise for a long time , not since the night when they had stood shivering , side by side , before the window of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . That night , before they had noticed the fire , he had asked her to marry him , and she had said , Maybe , when the time comes . ' Do n't you love me ? ' he had demanded . Yes , ' she had told him . Why wo n't you promise me , then ? ' No , ' she had said . That 's like making a dare . It would be like daring life . ' That 's nonsense . ' It would just be a dare , and I have n't got the nerve . I just have n't . ' That 's nonsense , ' he repeated . Then he had become aware that she was weeping . She had wept almost silently , but he had felt the bed quivering with the force of her suppressed sobbing . What 's the matter , what 's the matter ? ' he had demanded . Nothing , ' she had said . He had put his hand on her face to find it wet with tears.  |p252Darling  , darling , stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were the kind would ever cry about anything . Darling , you must n't , ' he had insisted , holding his hand on her face . I have n't cried in years , not years , ' she had managed to say , still sobbing , but I just ca n't help it . I ca n't . ' I love you , I love you , ' he had declared . I promise I 'll love you always . ' Do n't promise '  --  and the sobbing had choked her  --  anything , ever . Promising means time and I do n't want to think about time ; I do n't Hush , hush , ' he had said . Later , moving from the bed toward the door to return to her room , she had hesitated with her face in the direction of the window . Look , ' she had whispered , pointing . He had slipped out of the bed and gone to the window . The night had been unusually dark , the dark mass of the earth scarcely darker than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon , a single center of rich , cherry-colored glow fading outward and upward into the enormous hollow of darkness . A dog had barked very faintly , very far off . Lucille Christian had come to stand beside him . What is it ? ' she had whispered . He had told her that he did not know , and had drawn her to him . She had shivered as she stood there against him , watching the distant point of light in the darkness . He had told her he did not know what the patch of flame on the horizon was ; but he did know . He knew that it was a burningtobacco barn . It was a barn belonging to some man who , after receiving warnings , had not listed his crop with the Association . He knew that a band of men from some other locality , Band Number Six , he remembered , Mr. Burden 's band from over in Hunter County , had picked up its guide , a mounted man waiting in the shadows by the roadside at an appointedp253place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames now made that little center of rosy light against the black sky . And he knew that some other night , soon , he himself would stand and watch men apply the match and then would mount and ride away , the hoofs of the horses drumming the frosty earth and the flames climbing the sky behind him . He knew , because that was the way it had already been . There were burnings all fall . As soon as the tobacco in the barns began to cure , the fires began . At first there were only a few , then there were the letters . Then there were many fires . Some men who received letters listed their crops immediately with the Association . Others sat up night after night , alone or with their sons or hands or tenants , guns ready . They waited , lying behind piles of brush or in the protection of a fencerow or behind a stone fence , while the cold stiffened their fingers on the metal of a rifle or shotgun , and their eyes blurred with sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady stars seemed to be withdrawing into a more and more incalculable distance . Sooner or later for some of those who guarded their barns , there came the night when out of confidence or weariness they relaxed their vigilance and stayed in their beds . And once or twice the night riders came just at dusk when men were at supper and expected no danger . Some of the larger growers sold their crops , half cured and hanging in the barns , to the companies , and the companies undertook to guard the barns . One gang of hired guards was surprised , half drunk at its post , and the men were whipped , dragged through a creek , and left lying , bound and gagged , by the roadside . The barns which they had been supposed to guard were burned . The night riders exchanged shots with another gang , and two men , under cover of the firing that drove the guards back to the protection of a cedar fencerow , galloped by the barn and flung two charges of dynamite against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusesp254from cigars which they held clamped in their teeth . The charges blew in one wall of the barn , and the curing fires in the barn ignited the tobacco . It was reported that one man , a Mr. Sanderson of the New Bethany community , had been burned to death in his barn , or had been shot and flung into the flames . He had , his wife said , left the house with his shotgun to guard his barn , as he had been accustomed to do for some time . But after the burning of the barn he had not appeared . His wife had run to the spot where the flames still rose , calling his name , and then , when there was no answer , she had run frantically and stumblingly across the fields to the nearest house , where there was a telephone . Men had come back with her to stand aimlessly before the glowing mass where the barn had been or to wander about the fields calling the man 's name . The next day , when the ashes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find what might remain of the body . They found nothing but the twisted metal which had apparently been the barrel of the shotgun . The body , it was assumed , had been completely destroyed . But Mr. Sanderson was not dead . He was found two weeks later , seventy-five miles away , over toward the central part of the state . Some boys out possum-hunting found him cowering in a thicket . His clothes were in tatters and he was almost barefoot . His beard was matted with mud and small fragments of dry leaf . He was nearly starving . He remembered nothing . When the boys questioned him , he put the knuckle of his right forefinger into his mouth , like a confused and frightened child , and peered from face to face . When they built a bonfire and tried to warm him , he was so terrified that they had to hold him . After a little while he became quiet in their grasp , but he kept shaking his head like a sick man who is too weak to protest otherwise against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his red-rimmed eyes . Later , he was identified and sent to his home . His healthp255gradually improved , and by spring he was able to go about his ordinary occupations . But he could never remember what had happened that night when his barn was burned , nor in the two weeks when he wandered over the countryside hiding in the woods and ditches . Toward the end of the curing period the numbers of burnings over the section increased . Just before the elections violent encounters were frequent between peaceful and respectable men . Prayers were offered from the pulpits that order might be restored , and sometimes that the injustice that had caused the disorder and the lifting of the hand of brother against brother might be corrected . Hit 's a curse , ' Mr. Grimes said to Mr. Munn , laid onto the land , hit looks lak . ' Mr. Munn stood in front of the stable door and tightened the girth on his mare . Mr. Grimes had climbed the fence to the lot , getting stiffly and awkwardly over the whitewashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he had greeted him , and then , after Mr. Munn 's reply , had stood and studied the light that faintly tinted the edges of the slate-colored clouds on the western horizon . The sun was already out of sight . Then , at last , he said , I 'm a-leave-en . ' He did not take his gaze off the western sky . Come January , ' he added . I thought I 'd be a-tellen you . ' I 'm sorry , ' Mr. Munn replied . He raised his head from his task and looked at the man . I 'm sorry to be a-tellen you , ' the man said . In the fading light Mr. Munn tried to read the man 's face , but it showed nothing . I wanted to be a-tellen you early , ' the man continued , so you could be looken round and make a trade . ' He hesitated , then resumed in an apologetic tone : Not you 'd have no trouble , not with a good place and give-en good furnishen and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a good crop this season , ' Mr. Munn said , drouth and all . You 'll get some money out of it . '  |p256Hit  's a good crop . ' Are n't you satisfied here ? You 've been here before . You came back . ' I 'm satisfied , ' Mr. Grimes admitted , but that ai n't all . ' What is it ? ' Mr. Grimes returned his gaze to the west . The color was fading now from the edges of the low clouds , and as their own slate color darkened they seemed to gain in weight and solidity . This carryen on round the country , ' he said . Men carries on and revels round the country at night . Burnen and sich . I ai n't a-sayen who 's right and who 's wrong . Hit ai n't fer me to say . The Book says , jedge not . Hit 's fer God A-mighty to say . But I ai n't easy in my mind . And I 'm a-leave-en . ' You mean you 're leaving this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , ' Mr. Grimes answered , and I reckin I do n't know nuthen but terbacker , come right down to hit . But I alluz say , a man kin put his hand to hit when the time comes . I 'm a-leave-en . ' The rnarc stirred restively , and Mr. Munn patted her on the neck , murmuring to her . Then he said : If you do n't want your crop in the Association next year , you can hold it out . If that 's it . I prefer for you to have it in , but I would n't want you to go on that account . There 's plenty men who raise on shares have held their crops out . ' I ai n't easy in my mind , ' he declared . They 's some as wo n't tech terbacker , snuff , smoke , ner chew , ner lay a hand to hit fer a liven . They say hit 's a God 's curse . ' A man living round here has n't much choice , ' Mr. Munn remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse , ' Mr. Grimes said , like they says , and hit a curse all these years and me too blind to see . ' Mr. Munn leaned over and tightened the girth on his mare . I do n't reckon it 's that bad , ' he returned.  |p257Hit  's a curse , ' Mr. Grimes insisted , laid onto the land , hit looks lak . ' Mr. Munn swung up to the saddle . From his height he looked out over Mr. Grimes ' head and over the fields , where darkness was gathering . It seemed to gather and rise from the fields , rising to extinguish whatever little light yet showed in the upper air . Well , ' he concluded , I 'm sorry you 're going . ' Hit ai n't yore doen , ' Mr. Grimes said.  |p258WHEN  Mr. Munn rode out of the shadowed lane toward the white picket fence , that was dimly visible , a figure rose from beside the carriage block at the gate and waited for him . Closer , he saw that it was a negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palings of the fence , for the hitching-rack would not accommodate them all . The negro said , Howdy-do , boss , kin I hitch yore hoss ? ' and reached for the bridle . Mr. Munn swung out of the saddle and dropped the rein . Thanks , ' he replied . Is you one of the gemmun gon na spend the night ? ' the negro asked . Yes , ' Mr. Munn said . He fumbled in the saddlebags and pulled out a small packet , tied up in newspaper . I jes ' wanted to know , boss , so I 'd know to put her in the stable . All the hosses for the gemmun whut spends the night I puts in the stable . ' Then , when Mr. Munn seemed to hesitate , the negro added , Misser Ball , he say jes ' come right on in , jes ' go over to the ' cademy house , over yander , and jes ' push , he say jes ' open the big dohr , and dar ' t is . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white gate , which sagged under his touch and with its motion set up a loud clankingof plowshares that hung on a wire for weights . A dog growled suddenly , a deep-throated , powerful growl near at hand , and another dog , a little farther off , barked . Ai n't nuthen to worry ' bout , ' the negro man assured him , ai n't nuthen . Dey 's all tied up tonight . Ai n't tied up , dey eat a man , ha'r and hide , liver and lights . Yassuh . Pow'fulp259mean . Yassuh  --  ' As he moved away , he heard the negro still talking , saying , Yassuh . ' The dogs continued to bark while Mr. Munn walked over the brittle leaves toward the dark , formless bulk that was the building . He could see cracks of light where the windows were . Up the hill he could see , vaguely , the mass of another building , and a little light . That , he decided , must be the dwelling-house . He reached the academy building and fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rough surface of a log , and then chinking . He found the latch , lifted it , and entered . When he entered the long room , he was aware , even as his eyes adjusted themselves to the sudden light , of a tenseness , a hush . The backs of all the men were toward him . He quietly closed the door , took off his gloves and coat , and moved toward the nearer of the two big fireplaces that heated the room . That 's the size of it , ' a man at the other end of the room was saying . Then there was silence again , except for the nervous shuffling of some man 's boots on the board floor . The men were scattered in several groups about the room , sitting on top of desks or lounging against the walls . Doctor MacDonald stood in front of the other hearth , his head bent over a piece of paper . He raised his head , straightened to his height , and passed his gaze deliberately over the men assembled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has just come in , I 'll read this communication again . ' I 'm sorry to have inconvenienced the meeting , ' Mr. Munn apologized . I miscalculated the distance , I reckon . ' This is a letter received by Mr. Murdock , here , ' and Doctor MacDonald inclined his long head toward a heavy-featured , dark man who lounged against the wall , near one of the lamp brackets . Then he added , Unsigned . ' Having pronounced the word , he smiled confidentially at the men , with the air of one who feels it unnecessary to point the humor of a situation , and then began to read.  |p260Dear  Mr. Murdock , If you knows what is good fer you , you will git rid of them niggers on yore place and git you some white croppers like a white man ought . When January gits here you better hunt you up some good hard-workin white men and make you a trade and git rid of them black bastards . He folded the piece of paper . I need n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ai n't no secret , ' Mr. Murdock remarked glumly . He walked across to the fireplace before which Doctor MacDonald stood , spat upon the burning logs , and addressed himself to the company . Ai n't no man gon na tell me who 's gon na crop on my place . That is , till the bank takes it over . ' He spat again , and walked back to resume his place against the wall . He added , Which ai n't gon na be long , I 'm free to tell you , unless something happens . ' A lot of lilks bccn saying ai n't no man gon na tell ' em when they could sell their tobacco , ' Mr. Burden said . It 's all whose shoes it is pinches . ' Doctor MacDonald grinned . That 's a way of putting it , ' he admitted , but there 's a dillcrence . Now Durn it , ' Mr. Christian said . Mr. Munn had not seen him before . He was sitting humped over in one of the desks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , say it 's whose shoes pinches . Say it , and I say , well , by God , I 've just decided it ai n't gon na be mine , it 's gon na be somebody else 's for a pissing-spell . ' I do n't mean to say I 'm backing down , ' Mr. Burden explained , shaking his mass of dark , unkempt hair so that the forelock fell over his brow . It ai n't a secret I 've done things of late I never thought I 'd set my hand to , but I reckon there 's been many a man could say that before he turned his eyes top261the wall . But I ai n't backing down . I was just remarking . All I said it was , was whose shoe it is pinches . ' There 's a difference , now , you 'll grant , ' Doctor MacDonald said . He smiled and wagged his pipe at Mr. Burden . The fellow who wrote this note to Mr. Murdock is some poor Godforsaken , belly-dragging blackguard that blames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's honest and got jaybird sense and wants to crop can get a place round here . The niggers are n't crowding him any . It 's a little different down in Louisiana , where I come from , maybe , but not here . You 'll grant now , Mr. Burden '  --  he addressed Mr. Burden pleasantly and patiently , as though explaining something , the course of a disease , perhaps , or the meaning of a symptom , as though making an effort for the simple and non-technical description  --  ' you 'll grant there 's a difference between this sort of thing '  --  and he tapped the paper , which he held in one hand , with the stem of his pipe  --  and the meaning of our '  --  he paused slightly , grinning again  --  endeavors . There 's Professor Ball , who had been standing by the wall , a little aloof , leaned his tall , emaciated body forward , and thrust out a bandaged forefinger . A difference , ' he said croakingly  --  the difference between justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's telling ' em , Professor , ' Mr. Christian exclaimed . I just had it on the tip of my tongue . ' Doctor MacDonald was waiting for them to finish . He was standing very straight , but casually , for his erectness always had about it a certain impression of repose , and confidence , as well . His long arms hung loosely , the wrists showing out of the too-short sleeves . He looked from Professor Ball to Mr. Christian and back again , with a bearing of courtesy and tolerance , and waited to be sure that they had finished speaking . Mr. Christian again sank back upon himself , paying no attention , apparently , to what was going on around him . Thenp262Doctor MacDonald said , speaking very deliberately : You all know I said when you elected me that I 'd try not to get you into any more trouble than necessary . Well , we 've been in plenty of trouble . Over half a year now . We all got into it together , and we do n't know how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually and conversationally , but it was distinct even at the other end of the room . He paused . Then he continued , his voice gaining a certain sharpness : But it has n't done enough good . I know that . You know it . This fall the companies have managed to buy tobacco . They 've paid high for it , but they 've managed to get it . Enough to tide them over . That tobacco is in their warehouses . In Bardsville , in Millville , in Alltown , in Morganstown . ' He paused again . He let his gaze wander from the group before him , as though for the moment he had forgotten them , and seemed to find his interest at the far end of the raftered. ceiling . Then he fixed his eyes upon them , and leaned toward them , confidentially , thrusting out his long , bony face . It 's in their warehouses , ' he repeated . Millions of pounds . It 's lying there , in those warehouses . In Bardsville , in Millville , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  he grinned at them , amusedly , almost apologetically , confidentially , drawing his lips back so that the long dog-teeth were exposed , and leaned closer  --  I 'm proposing a little trouble , boys . ' There was silence in the room for a moment , except for the comfortable , domestic drone and hiss of the logs being consumed in the big fireplace behind him . Then , in a fiat , uncommunicativetone , some man said , Well , I 'm durned . ' Well ? ' Doctor MacDonald asked , leaning . Nobody said anything . Well ? ' Doctor MacDonald asked again , with a suggestion of mockery in the word . Then a dozen voices broke out at once . Boot heels scraped on the boards as men moved restlessly about . Doctor Mac/Donald , grinning , lifted his hands for silence , and held them up while the noise subsided . It 's the last card , ' he said . The truth , ' some man agreed . The last , ' Doctor MacDonald repeated . There wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsided beneath his lifted hands . The last card , ' Mr. Munn said , very loud . Some of the men turned to look at him , then others . The last card , ' Mr. Munn reiterated . It 's take it or leave it . And I say , take it Take it ! ' a voice called . Take it , ' Mr. Munn said again , for it 's the last chance . But there 's another reason . Mr. Burden , yonder '  --  he pointed at the man , who from under his dark , shaggy forelock stared stolidly at him , shaking his head  --  he said tonight he 's done things this year he never thought he 'd set his hand to . So 've you . So 've I , and , by God , I say so . And so 've you . There 's no use to name them . You know . Everybody --  ' It had to be , ' Mr. Murdock said . By God ' Mr. Christian exclaimed , starting up fromhis seat and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sentence . It was a mistake , ' Mr. Munn said . But it 's done . It was a mistake , because when we tried to fight against the companies we had to fight against some of our own people too . People who could n't see and understand , but our own people . But this 'll be different . This 'll be clear . Clear as day . Them or us . When we march in -- March ! ' a voice exclaimed . March in , ' Mr. Munn said slowly . When we march in , it 'll be clear . Not a half-dozen men with a handful of matches and a can of coal oil . No . A thousand . Two thousand . As many as we need . All of us . And in column . Then '  --  and he was filled with certainty , a deep , sure , clean conviction that en- gulfed him like a flood , and he scarcely heard his own words .  --  it will all be different . It will all be clear as day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the benches against the wall and leaned back against the uneven surface of the logs . The voices went on , and he heard them . The men would go . They were voting , and they would vote to go . He felt a tightening of his muscles and a prickling of the skin across his back and shoulders . Through the heavy cloth of his coat he felt the roughness and solidity of the logs against which he leaned . Gradually he relaxed , listening to the voices . The men would go . They had decided on Bardsville first . Which was good . The biggest warehouses were there . That was right . Get the biggest ones first . It ought to be before the New Year , some man had said . Or sooner , another had added . Sooner . We need time , ' Doctor MacDonald had pointed out , nothing too hasty . Maybe we 've been too hasty in the past , but not now . Now well be sure . ' Time ? How much time ? ' someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able by New Year 's , ' Doctor MacDonald had answered . But we have to drill the men . That takes time . We could n't get all of them ready by that time . But we do n't need all . Say , about a thousand . ' Some man had said : You get more'n a thousand and a lot will have to come a long way . They 'll be half a day coming . Some , more . ' We wo n't need more'n a thousand , ' Doctor MacDonald had told him . That 'll make a show , I reckon . Later --  ' AndMr . Munn , not looking up , had known how at the moment of the pause he must have been grinning easily and confidently at the men around him , shaking his unlit pipe at them probably . And he had heard the voice go on :  --  maybe we 'll need more . ' Yeah , yeah '  --  it had been a voice which Mr. Munn could not recognize . There 's the other towns , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p265And  Doctor MacDonald had said , never fear , they would n't wait too long , not long enough for the companies to take any steps . They would n't discriminate too much in favor of Bardsville . Then Mr. Munn walked over to join the group . They were talking about preparing the men , how to drill them . And how many would go into Bardsville on foot . And whether to burn or dynamite the warehouses . Then one of the men asked if they reckoned there 'd be any fighting . We 'll have the drop , ' a man said , anyway . ' Maybe there will be some , sooner or later , ' Doctor MacDonaldconceded , but we 'll try to keep the drop . ' Then he added , Did any of you boys ever hear a bullet go by right close to your head ? ' I ai n't honing to , neither , ' Mr. Murdock said . I reckon I have , ' another man asserted . He was a small , knotty-looking man , with a compact , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pig-nut , little , brown , and hard-shelled . The knotty-looking little man said that he had been in Cuba . For the duration , ' he said , and I reckon I heard a few go past . ' He slipped one arm out of its coat sleeve , and began to fumble at the buttons of his shirt . But there was one I did n't hear . ' He pushed back the shirt and the thick layer of wool underwear to expose in the lamplightthe flesh of his shoulder . Yeah , there was one did n't go past . ' He thrust his bare shoulder forward , exhibiting it . In the firm , tightly muscled flesh there was a star-shaped depressionlarge enough to accommodate a thumb-tip , puckered and white against the brownness of the surrounding surface . He looked anxiously , with a kind of poorly concealed pride , from face to face of the peering men . Now , I be dog-gone , ' one of the men exclaimed slowly , and reached out to lay a finger in the old wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said ; it wasp66a Mauser done it . That was a kind of rifle them bastards used down there . ' He glanced down at the mark as though to verify its presence , and observed : One thing funny , now , you know it never hurt none to speak of , that is , right at first . Not a mite . But it shore-God knocked me down when it hit . ' He paused , then added , It was outside Santiago . ' I see it cracked up the clavicle some , ' Doctor MacDonald said . The small man looked up at Doctor MacDonald soberly . I do n't know what name it goes by , ' he answered , but it cracked a right smart . ' Then he grinned , for the moment , with his small , brown , unformed face looking like a boy 's . Well , ' Doctor MacDonald said , if you never heard one sing by your head , there 's one thing you can lay to . That 's that it 'll sound a lot worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now that 's a mouthful , ' the small man agreed . I ai n't honing to hear one , ' Mr. Murdock said again . The small man looked up inquiringly at Doctor MacDonald . Was you down there , ' he asked , in Cuba ? ' No , ' Doctor MacDonald answered . The men began to turn away from the small man , to each other and to the fire . Some of them were putting on their overcoatsand mackinaws . The small man stood by himself now , his shirt and underwear still pulled back to expose the scar of the old wound . He himself looked down at the scar . Then , tentatively , as though there might yet be pain in it , he prodded it . He looked around , secretively , at the other men , but they were shaking hands and saying good night to each other . He fastened his clothing , pulled on a worn mackinaw and a black fur cap with ear-flaps , and moved toward the edge of the largest group . The men began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threes . Professor Ball stood at the door , very erect , sayingp267good-bye to each man as he went out . Finally , all of them had gone , except Mr. Munn , Mr. Christian , and three other men from over beyond Bardsville . They stood in front of one of the fireplaces with Doctor MacDonald . Professor Ball approached them , and said , Well , gentlemen , I feel we have had a very successful meeting . ' It had better be , ' one of the men observed , a thin-nosed , dry-skinned fellow with drooping , sandy-colored mustaches . His name was Peebles , and he came from over near Monclair . He spoke , and then , with deliberation , spat upon the declining embers . How do you reckon your people are gon na take to this ? ' Doctor MacDonald asked . They ai n't gon na complain none , ' the man said , not much , no-way . They been on short rations so long they 're nigh ready fer anything you name . Take me , ' he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ordinary , but what I been through , eight children and them about to be wrapping their feet in tow-sack to go out in the weather , and I 'm durn nigh ready fer anything . I ai n't no diff'rent from ordinary . ' Well , anyway , your distinguished neighbor is n't going to the Senate , ' Doctor MacDonald remarked . That 's something . Even if he did win his suit against us , and get his God-damned tobacco back . What Dismukes paid him for that oughter keep his feet off the wet ground for a spell . ' He got paid , all right , ' Mr. Peebles said , I 'll lay to that . But he spent a sight of money trying to be elected . ' Elected or not , ' Mr. Christian put in , half as though to himself , he 'd never got there , not if I had to wring the bastard'sneck with my own hands . ' The man named Peebles looked at Mr. Christian , and glumly nodded . You ai n't the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to bank the fires , but Professor Ball reminded him that it would n't be necessary , that tomorrowp268was Saturday and no school . Professor Ball began to blow out the lights , and the men gathered their coats . Mr. Peebles asked if they were sure his staying would n't put them out , and Doctor MacDonald said no , that a few of the boys boarded there during the week , but they went home over Friday night till Sunday night , and there was plenty of room . The last lamp was blown out , and the long room had only the fading firelight . Doctor MacDonald pulled open the heavy door . The cold of the air struck like a blow . Mr. Munn walked slightly behind the other men . He lifted his eyes to the deep , vaulted darkness above the trees , and filled his lungs with the probing coldness of the air . He felt very tired , but light and relieved and cleansed , like a man who , convalescing from a long sickness , goes out into the open air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundly than for many months . Sunk in the big feather bed , he seemed , as he closed his eyes , to be flowing and falling , effortlessly , deeply , deliciously , and forever . By eleven o'clock on the night of December 30 , most of the people of Bardsville were at home and in bed . Some men still hung about in the saloons , hunched over the bar to look at their reflections in the mirror , or standing back from the bar with a glass in one hand and the other raised to affirm some disputed point ; the barmen , however , were already beginning to glance at the clocks and to execute their movements with a greater and greater , and a more impersonal , deliberation . Small groups still sat about in the lobbies of the two hotels , but the conversation was waning . A few bands of boys and young men roamed up and down the streets of the business section , flinging firecrackers that exploded with a hollow , echoing sound between the rows of buildings , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the arc-lamps , with their hands thrust into their pocketsp269and their shoulders drawn against the briskness of the air , But away from the business section the streets were deserted , except for a few isolated figures that would hurry along under the bare boughs of the maples , their heels making on the brick pavements a small , clicking sound as regular and empty as the ticking of a clock . The houses between which they passed were darkened , with only , perhaps , a little light showing through the glass above a front door or under the drawn shade of an upper room . At fifteen minutes after eleven a locomotive whistled for a crossing to the south of town , and then , soon after , slid heavily alongside the deserted depot . The night man at the station came out , and with a greeting muffled by weariness and disinterest , handed up a paper to the engineer . The fireman clambered up over the tender and fumbled clankingly at the spout of the water tower . Rushingly , the black water , streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station lamps , poured into the reservoir . The few passengers who had descended at the platform disappeared up the street . The station man went back into the office , where now he could stoke up the fire in the round-bellied iron stove , set his alarm clock , and doze on a sagging cot until four o'clock . A voice called , All er-board , ' without emphasis . From the lighted interiors of the coaches a few faces pressed against the glass of the windows to peer out at the deserted platform .. The steam feathered whitely from the cylinders and the train began to pull away . North of town it whistled again , and the sound prolongeditself wailingly over the fields and the woods , and was heard by wakeful persons in the bedrooms of houses on that side of town . Standing at the edge of a dry elder thicket that bordered the lane just before it crossed the tracks , Doctor MacDonald heard the approaching blast of the whistle . The long , glaring beam of the headlight knifed through the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks . Then the locomotive plunged over the crossing with a multiple thunder of wheels , and as it passed , the figure of the fireman was for a moment visible , bent to heave a shovelful of coal into the firebox door . Then the last coaches whipped past , the dry leaves along the track sank in the failing gust of the passage , and the train fled away down the tubular corridor of light before it . On time , ' Doctor MacDonald said , extinguished the match by which he had read his watch , and clicked shut , with a gesture of finality , the watchcase . She was on time , ' Doctor MacDonald repeated . The engineer , ' the man said , and nodded toward the woods across the lane , now I wonder could he see all them fellers over there . ' If he did , ' Doctor MacDonald replied , he 'll have something to tell his kids when he gets to Chicago tomorrow . ' His eyes . were fixed after the disappearing train . A pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the otherwise invisible plume of smoke that trailed over the locomotive . The fireman would be stoking for the cut northward . ' Nam , ' another voice said from the shadow of the thicket , the engineer sets on the other side , he could n't see nothing over here . ' The train was out of sight now . No one spoke for a minute or two . There was no sound except a faintly rasping , dry , restless sound from the dark woods across the lane , a sound like a breeze in dead leaves before they fall . But there was no wind . Doctor MacDonald began to sing under his breath , almost wordlessly : The old gray mare come trotten through the wilderness , trotten through the wilderness , trotten through the wilderness . The old gray mare comeIt 's cold , ' one of the voices said subduedly.  |p271It  's this standing around , ' the other voice rejoined . Well , ' the first man said , I hope we do n't find it no hotter before day , huh ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a creek but we could n't git acrost , we could n't git acrost , we could n't git acrostDo you reckon there 's any chance it 's true about word gettingout ? ' Doctor MacDonald sang softly ,  --  but we could n't git acrostIt came pretty straight , ' the other man answered , from a man drives a team for the Alta . ' Doctor MacDonald stopped singing . If there is a home guard , or whatever that fellow said it was , ' he said , it 'll be a passel of warehouse hands and clerks and young bucks with nothing better to do . Unless they brought in some other men on the train . And we 'll know that in a minute . Soon as he gets here . ' He began to sing , so softly that the words were indistinguishable now . The other men were silent . Mr. Munn said , I hear him now . ' Doctor MacDonald stopped humming . There was the sound of a horse galloping up the lane from the pike , an increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a roll on a damp and sagging drumhead . The bulk of the horse and rider loomed suddenly out of the dark , almost upon the group , and the rider slid out of his saddle . Well ? ' Doctor MacDonald demanded . Not a thing , ' the rider reported , not a thing stirring . We walked round uptown and down by the warehouses , and watched the train come in . Not a thing stirring . ' Ah , ' Doctor MacDonald said , with a gentle and sibilant exhalation of his breath . Then he took his watch from his pocket , and struck a match against his trousers . Shielding the flame with his cupped hand , he peered at the watch , and ,  |p272briefly  , his long , bony face was illuminated . Eight minutes to twelve , ' he asserted matter-of-factly , and extinguished the match . Then : Mr. Murphy , Mr. Sykes , we 're ready . ' Two of the men who had been standing beside him at the edge of the lane turned abruptly into the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves and dry elder stalks , led out their horses . Tell Mr. Sills to move in , ' Doctor MacDonald ordered . Tell him to hit the bottom of Jefferson Street as near to twelve-thirty as he can . He knows what to do from that point . And '  --  he turned to the other man , who had already mounted  --  Mr. Sykes , you tell Mr. Murdock to hit the Cherry Creek bridge at the same time . He knows , then . But tell them not to touch a wire till five minutes before they move in . That 's all . ' The two men wheeled , lifted their horses into a gallop , and almost immediately , long before the sound of hoofs had faded , out , were lost in the darkness . Doctor MacDonald peered after them , then directed : ' All right , Mr. Mosely , tell Mr. Hamer to start . And to make them keep formation all the way . ' The figure of a man moved from the edge of the elder thicket , crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctor MacDonald began to sing again , very softly , almost tunelessly : Rock of ages , cleft for me , let me hide myself in Thee , let the water Mr. Munn tried to make out his face , but could not . There was only the paler blur in the darkness . Then he looked up at the sky . Only a few stars were visible . There 'll be , he thought , more than six hours till light . It 's shore-God now cold , ' a voice said . No one replied . Mr. Munn tried to move his toes inside his boots , but they were stiff and cramped . He had not realized how cold he was . Now , up to the knees , his legs were almost as stiff and dead as posts . He could not detect the words of Doctor MacDonald'sp273singing any more , they had sunk so low . He tried to remember how the words of the hymn went . A voice called out , subduedly and indistinguishably , from the woods across the lane . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods , then , suddenly , was a peremptoryshuffling and crackling . A single figure appeared in the lane . They 're coming , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Then there were the others . They came out of the woods , shuffling the dead leaves , to hesitate raggedly in the open lane and then form four abreast and move toward the railroad tracks . They carried guns on their shoulders , and strips of white cloth were across their faces . A few other men , masked too and with white bands on their left arms , stood in the lane , and kept saying , in harsh , suppressed voices : Move up , there ! Move up , four abreast ! Make it four abreast , and hold it . ' The head of the column moved up the lane , and turned down the railroad track toward town . But in the lane it was constantlyreplenished , the men there filtering from the strip of woodland , hesitating , then forming and moving away after the others . The last men came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . The sound of their crunching tread died away . There was silence except for the , stamping of a horse beyond the elder thicket . Doctor MacDonald looked at his watch . Mr. Burrus , ' he said , it 's time for you all to be getting on to the telephone office . You 'll make it about right if you start now . ' Sure , ' a voice responded drawlingly . The man walked off down the lane . In a minute there was a crackling of brush down the lane , and then the sound of hoofs . Mr. Munn wondered , idly , why Doctor MacDonald did not start . He wondered what time it must be by now . It could not be long , now . In a minute , in two minutes , they would mount , and move in . The cold had climbed past his knees ,  |p274but  somehow he was not really uncomfortable , and did not feel disposed to stamp his feet and swing his arms , as some of the other men had done . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald was speaking . Get the telegraph wires at exactly twelve-twenty-five , ' he said . And you , Mr. Murray , you and your boys get the telephone wires on the pike at the same time . Then come in by Jefferson to Fifth . Pick up anybodyloose on upper Jefferson . ' The two men moved off . We 're ready , ' Doctor MacDonald announced , and turned back into the elder thicket . Mr. Munn and the three other men remaining followed him . They led their horses out into the lane , and mounted . Twenty yards or so down the lane toward the pike , they stopped , and two of the men rode into the grove , which was more open here . Well , we might as well put on our fancy-dress , ' Doctor MacDonald said . He drew from his pocket a strip of white cloth and adjusted it over the lower part of his face . He pinned a white band around his left arm . Mr. Munn and the other man put on their masks . Horsemen began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the pike . Doctor MacDonald , accompanied by Mr. Munn and the other man , trotted to the head of the uneven line . At the junction of the lane and the pike they stopped , then moved out into the pike . Form them here , ' Doctor MacDonald ordered , and Mr. Munn and the other man moved back along the line , passing the word . Four abreast the long column moved forward at a trot . The pike stretched out straight before them , its paleness distinguishablein the darkness . Down the slight slope ahead , the few lights of the town were visible . They are lights in the streets , Mr. Munn thought , and in houses ; and in other houses , the houses that are dark , people are sleeping . Behind him the metal ofp275horseshoes chinked and rang on the gravel of the pike with a steady sound . The head of the column reached the end of the slope . There the first houses were , jumbled shacks set back in treeless yards , their gray masses undefined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamp was burning . Mr. Munn saw it as he rode past , and could catch a glimpse of the board table on which it sat and of the bare interior of the room , and he remembered how the wavering lamps had lighted those other cabins that night when he had hunted the knife . Twelve-thirty , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Burrus ought to be in the telephone office by now . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn replied . And the wires down , ' Doctor MacDonald added . The column swept into a regular street . The houses , beyond the bare trees , were darkened . The street lights were out . They passed a fork in the street , where another street joined at an angle , and Mr. Munn , turning in his saddle , could dimly see that the last section of the column was diverging into the other street . It would cover , he knew , that entrance to the town . Far away , almost lost in the sound of hoofs , there was the report of a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few spattering explosions , all innocent and unimpressive from distance . For an instant , Mr. Munn scarcely grasped the meaning of the sound ; then he knew that it was Mr. Murdock 's men . They had hit the Cherry Creek bridge and were over . West , ' the man on the other side of Doctor MacDonald said , and cocked his head . It 's west , and it 's Murdock . ' Here goes , ' Doctor MacDonald announced in a conversationaltone , but as though he had not heard the other man . Mr. Munn saw that he held in his right hand a revolver . He raised the revolver slowly , muzzle upward , and Mr. Munn , with the inheld breath , waited for the explosion . It came , sudden and blasting , just by his head . A long moment , andp276there was the roar of the volley behind him . His own revolver leaped in his hand at the recoil , but the individual explosion was swallowed up and lost . Lights appeared in a few houses along the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one scream painful and sustained , then two short , gasping cries that concluded on a complaining note . The lights in the houses began to go out . After the head of the column had passed , the woman began to scream again . They ought to slap her and put her in a cold bath , ' Doctor MacDonald pronounced dispassionately . That brings ' em out of it . ' At a trot the column climbed the rise toward the corner of Jefferson and Main . It had reached the business section , now , and moved between the stores where the cold-looking , shadowy glass of the display windows gave blankly on the street . Just before they reached the corner , Doctor MacDonald commanded : Hold your boys along here , Pcrse , at the corner , you can see four ways there . They 'll come up the hill here , and go out Jefferson when they go . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said . He pulled his mare over toward the curb . The column moved past him , and he watched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the flopping hat-brims . A good many of the mounts , he could tell even in such a light , were jaded and work-worn . They thrust their long necks out , and their bony , hammer-shaped heads jerked mechanically with the motion of their bodies . Some of them had been ridden pretty far already ; and it would be farther before morning . His own band , and the band that would act with his , were at the end of the column . Just before they came up even with him , he lifted his hand , and raggedly they drew to a halt . Mr. Allen , Mr. Todd , ' he ordered , you all go down Main , west , to the next corner so you can keep an eye out up and downp277that cross-street . Anything stirring , and one of you come back up here . ' All right , ' the man named Allen said . Benton Todd , sitting his horse very straight , said nothing . The two men detached themselves from the main body , turned the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest of you just form four abreast , ' Mr. Munn directed , at the corner there '  --  and he pointed to the corner  --  and wait till it 's over . ' Then he added , We 'll be the last out , on this side of town anyway . ' The men moved into position at the corner , juggling their mounts into a crude order . God-a-mighty , hit 's a-gonna be cold here , ' one man said , wind outer the north rising now like hit is and come-en down Jefferson . Us standing here , and ai n't nuthen to break hit . ' It wo n't be long , ' Mr. Munn said . Besides , we 're supposed to stay here . ' I ai n't complainen , ' the man replied . The rest of the column of mounted men was far down Main Street , to the east , now . Down there , along the tracks , were the warehouses , all of them strung out along Front Street . Mr. Munn wondered if they were putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on foot had already passed down at the foot of the slope . He pulled off his right glove and held his hand to the wind . It was coming from the north , all right , as tar as he could tell with the buildings and all , and it was treshening . He hoped it would n't get much stiffer . A high wind , and there 'd be a good chance of burning up the town when the warehouses went . But an east wind would be the most dangerous . An east wind would bring the fire right up the rise , this way , through the middle of town . The lights were on in the lobby of the hotel , a few doors down the street . But the lights that had at first come on in the rooms upstairs were out now , all but one , one on the top floor . Itp278made a streak of yellow light under a lowered window-shade . Down Jefferson , southward , there was a single shot , and Mr. Munn turned toward it . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson into a cross-street . Then , as they wheeled , they fired a volley into the air . Mr. Sills , Mr. Munn thought , and his men . Mr. Sills , he thought . He tried to imagineMr . Sills , his small , thin , gray face set and expressionless beneath the white cloth , riding along the dark streets , prefacing his dry-voiced orders to his men with a cough , lifting a revolver as he rode , and firing , suddenly , into the darkness . It was absurd . But Mr. Sills was down there , with a hundred men , and they would go back down the next street , to the edge of town , and wheel , and fire a volley , and again come back up Jefferson , and fire . And the people would stay indoors , lying in their beds , propped upon one elbow with their ears straining and their hearts knocking , and their wives would clutch them by the arm until the nails cut the flesh , or the bolder men would peer secretively out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , as they rode past . They were all afraid of Mr. Sills , tonight . Look , ' one of the men said , and Mr. Munn followed his pointing finger . Look , there 's a fellow coming out the hotel . ' A man came unsteadily from the hotel doorway , and stood for a moment motionless on the pavement . I believe ' one of the men began . Then another cried : Watch out ! he 's got a gun . ' But before the words were out of his mouth , the man had fired . The bastard , ' the first man uttered , and fumbled for his own revolver . The man on the pavement fired again , but the report of his shot almost merged with the boom of the heavy-caliber revolver of the horseman . The big pane of glass in the main hotel windowcollapsed with a shattering sound just behind the man onp279the pavement . The man on the pavement wavered , and fell forward . By God , ' somebody said , you got him ! ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . ' Then : See about him . ' And he rode toward the spot . Two men , the one who had fired the shot and another , slipped out of their saddles , and ran to the fallen man . Mr. Munn , from his saddle , looked down at them as they turned the body over , and fumbled at the buttons of the coat . He 's alive , ' one of the men said excitedly . His heart , I can feel it ! ' Where 's he hit ? ' Mr. Munn demanded . Hit ! ' The other man , the man who had fired the shot , stood up . Hit ! the bastard 's drunk . ' He looked down at him disgustedly . He 's puked all over hisself . ' You might-er killed him , ' the other man said . He might-er killed me . ' Listen , ' Mr. Munn said , you 're supposed to fire when you 're ordered . You understand ? ' Ai n't no bastard gon na shoot at me , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Fire , ' he repeated , when you 're ordered , I said . Do you understand ? ' All right , ' the man said grudgingly . Now drop that fellow in the lobby of the hotel , ' Mr. Munn ordered , and get back in line . ' He watched them drag the fallen man toward the doorway , kicking aside the shattered glass on the pavement as they did so ; then he returned to his position at the intersection of the streets . All the men there were staring down the slope of Main Street , eastward . There at the foot of the slope , under the distantarc-light , he could see the column of men on foot passing toward the warehouses . Mr. Munn took out his watch . It wo n't be very long now , ' he remarked . Wonder what took ' em so long , ' one of the men said.  |p280I  do n't know , ' Mr. Munn answered , unless we just miscalculated . I 've heard it said it takes a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does one man . I do n't know , but that 's what I 've heard said . ' The last men passed at the foot of the slope . There was nothing but the empty street , on which the store windows looked , and the thin string of arc-lights reaching one block beyond Front Street , down there . He heard the sound of a volley somewhere to the south  --  Mr. Sills again , he decided  --  and an answering volley behind him to the west , much nearer . That would be Mr. Murdock coming up . I bet a lotta folks does sumthen tonight they ai n't done in a long time , ' one of the men said , and snickered . What 's that ? ' another voice demanded . Pee in the bed . ' There was laughter . Then another voice : Them puny little old six-guns ai n't nuthen . Just wait till they hear them warehouses go , and then what ! ' There was more laughter . Then there was silence , the silence , all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawed at the pavement , then stopped . The arc-lamp above made a small , humming , empty sound . The shadows of the horses and riders spread out blackly around them on the pavement . The men were silent , as though straining to listen . A group of riders , a buggy , and several men on foot came down Jefferson Street , from the north , and approached the corner where Mr. Munn was . It was Mr. Murray 's band , which had waited to cut the wires , and the men they had picked up as they came in . When Mr. Munn questioned the men who had been picked up , they all , except the old man in the buggy , seemed frightened , and protested that they had been out so late just because they had to and that it had nothing to do withp281what was going on , and they gave their names in uncertain voices . But the old man was different . He was furious and fearless . He was Doctor Potter , he shouted , and he had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be damned if any gang of blackguards was going to keep him from getting to bed . Mr. Munn ordered two men to go with him and see him home . I do n't want them ! ' he shouted . I do n't need protection . Not from a gang of cowardly ruffians . You 'll all be in the penitentiary . You ought to be . You have n't any right , you blackguards ! ' It 's not for you to say , Doctor Potter , ' Mr. Munn finally said , and motioned to the men to move on . Doctor Potter shouted back something unintelligible as he drove away , slowly , down Jefferson . The other men , three of them , who had been picked up were ordered to stand back in a deep doorway of the store at the corner . Two of the men from Mr. Murray 's band dismounted , and stood in the street , just in front of the doorway . You wo n't be hurt , ' Mr. Munn told them , if you stay right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began snuffling . His wife was sick , he said , and she would be worried ; he had to get home to her . You 're lying , ' Mr. Munn said . You just thought of that . Now get back in there and shut up . ' He had scarcely listened to what the man said ; he was straining his ears , waiting . There were two more volleys ; then , again , the silence . The arc-lamp over his head hummed . He fixed his eyes eastward , down Main Street . A cat came out of an alley there , some thirty-odd feet away , and began to pick its way , fastidiously , across the street . It stopped to nose something in the gutter , then proceeded . A piece of newspaper slid over the pavement before the wind . It made a rustling , rasping sound . The cat was halfway across the street.  |p282The  sound , when it came , was at the first split instant more like an undefined bodily impact , a pressure on the head , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would not go away . It filled the air to bursting . It hung like a great grape , swollen and clustered in its reverberations . Then it was gone . The cat was frozen there in the middle of the empty street . The sound had passed . In the painful , empty silence that ensued , Mr. Munn heard the tinkling , brittle sound of glass striking the pavement . A piece of glass that had still clung to the shattered window of the hotel lobby had been dislodged . Under the pressure of the bit , his mare ceased her plunging . Down the hill , there was a volley , then a burst of shouting . The second explosion struck , less powerful than the first . Before its reverberations had fulfilled themselves , there was the third , still farther off . There 'll be one more , Mr. Munn thought , the Alta warehouse , the last one . He clamped his knees and his knuckles tightened on the rein . A single tongue of flame , curved like a whiplash in the fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope . The last blast came , and its echoes died off . A million dollars , ' a man remarked , loud but prayerfully  --  ' a million dollars , and gone just like that . ' Now the sky was reddening with the flames . Gone , ' another voice rejoined flatly , like them salts through the widder-woman . ' Down Jefferson , Mr. Sills ' men swung the corner again . Again there was their volley . Then there was silence ; and then , from an indeterminate direction , a sound like the sound of a horn , low-pitched , pervasive , penetrating . It came three times . They 're blowing now , ' somebody said . They 're gitten ready to go , blowen on that shotgun barr'l . ' They 'll be coming soon , ' Mr. Munn said . Right up by this corner . ' There they come now , ' a man called , some of'em. '  |p283A  group of men were turning into Main Street , two blocks down . Just around the corner they stopped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes toward them . He could not tell what they were doing . No more men came from around the corner . The group was still clustered there , milling about . Then two figures detached themselves from it . One figure seemed to stagger toward the middle of the street , then it fell . The other disappeared around the corner . Some of the men in the group down there were , apparently , entering a building . No one paid any attention to the figure that lay in the street . Mr. Simmons , ' Mr. Munn directed , you ride down there and see what 's going on . ' He pointed down the slope of Main Street . Yes , sir , ' the man said , but before he had touched heel to his horse , more men were running into Main Street from around the corner , below . They ran directly toward the first group , struck it , and merged with it . Then more men appeared . They picked up the figure which lay in the middle of the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , gesticulatedtoward the crowd . The man named Simmons was now approaching that other horseman . More men , a solid column of men , swung into Main Street , and moved up the slope toward the intersection of Main and Jefferson . The man named Simmons passed them as he galloped back . Beyond the approaching column , over the roofs , the sky was marked with a line of flames . Simmons drew up beside Mr. Munn . Cassidy 's saloon , ' he said , breathing heavily , some of ' em tried to bust into it . Their captain and another fellow , they tried to stop it , and they knocked out the captain . That was him laying in the street . The others , they come then and stopped ' em . My God , the doc , he 's down there raising hell , he 's Doctor MacDonald ? ' Mr. Munn demanded.  |p284Yeah  , Doctor MacDonald , that 's him on the horse , and , by God , what he 's telling ' em ! He 's calling ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked off down the slope . The head of the marchingcolumn was very near now , the men swinging along irregularlyfour abreast , laughing and shouting . Just then , a few random shots were fired from the column . Did Doctor MacDonald send any word ? ' he demanded . Yeah , yeah , ' the man said , his eyes fixed on the approaching column . He said if you caught anybody trying to bust in a saloon or anything , just pick ' em up , no matter even if they 're our fellows or not . He said beat hell outer ' em if you had to . He said shoot ' em in the leg . ' He said that ? ' Mr. Munn asked . That 's what he said , ' the man answered , and he 's sending word off to Mr. Sills and Mr. Murdock , too . ' Thanks , ' Mr. Munn said . And then : Just drop back into line , will you please , Mr. Simmons ? ' Excuse me , ' Mr. Simmons replied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rounding the corner , the nearest men little more than an arm 's length from the head of Mr. Munn 's mare . The men were laughing and shouting . Somebody fired a doublebarreledshotgun into the air , the two barrels in such quick succession that the reports almost blended . Mr. Munn studied the flames above the roofs . By God ! ' a voice shouted from the column  --  By God , we done it ! ' Another shot was fired , close at hand . The glass clattered from the show window of a store beyond the column . Another shout : We done it ! ' The men kept swinging past , shouting and laughing . The cloths had slipped down , carelessly , on their faces , or had been removed now . Mr. Munn looked at his watch . Another halfhour , he thought  --  no , three quarters. 285Three horsemen were riding alongside the column , approaching . One of them , Mr. Munn could see even before they reached the corner , was Doctor MacDonald . He wore no mask , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and his pipe stuck between his teeth . Hello , ' he said , almost casually . He had not removed the pipe . When he drew up , Mr. Munn said in a low voice , I hear you had some trouble down the hill ? ' Yes , ' Doctor MacDonald answered , but I gave somebody some trouble , too . ' Then he looked sharply at Mr. Munn 's face . Listen , ' he said , do n't let it prey on your mind . If a man 's in a fight , he do n't look to see whether or not his gun 's got a pearl handle and a monogram . ' It 's too bad , ' Mr. Munn remarked soberly . Son , the good Lord never got any thousand or so men together for any purpose without a liberal assortment of sons-ofbitchesthrown in . ' He grinned and looked at Mr. Munn sidewise . Not even for the purpose of burning tobacco warehouses , which is a thing to make the heavenly choir tune up . But '  --  he hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fellow up and does a trick like that , busting in that saloon , and it 's gon na be me or him . Next Wednesday when we hit Morganstown , it 'll be different , or I 'll know why . ' Well , ' Mr. Munn rejoined , ' otherwise I guess we 've had plenty of luck . So far . ' Boy , we had plenty , ' Doctor MacDonald declared . Not a word getting out , nothing . ' Mr. Munn watched the flames . They rose straight upward now . One piece , ' he said , was the wind dying down . We did n't burn up the town . ' For a minute there , ' Doctor MacDonald said , it looked like we might have to untie the boys down at the fire department . Just after we 'd got ' em all nice and quiet and resigned to their condition . ' He looked at his watch . The last column wasp286approaching . Then , with a different voice , he commanded : Give ' em half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start out ; we 're going out and hit Jefferson on the edge of town . The same time you start out north on Jefferson , Sills will be going out south . ' I do n't reckon on any trouble , ' Mr. Munn said . No , it looks now like all that home guard stuff was hot air . ' Doctor MacDonald lifted his reins . So long , ' he said , nodded to the two masked men who accompanied him , and touched his mount 's flank . He and the two men moved briskly off , southward down Jefferson . Mr. Munn decided that he must be going to give Sills his last directions . The head of the column was well up Jefferson Street now , to the north . The men were singing . They sang , The old gray mare ... ' and the reports of guns punctuated their voices . Some of the men straggling at the end of the column were firing at the glass of show windows of the stores . The God-damn fools , ' Mr. Munn exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those fools , ' Mr. Munn said somberly . Shooting that glass out 'll hurt us . It 'll hurt us bad . ' The sound of the singing came back down the street : ... came trotten ilirough the wilderness , Trotten through the wilderness . ' Yeah , ' the man rejoined , but did you ever feed a dog you 'd kept chained up and hungry and not hear him growl when he got his teeth in the meat ? ' Mr. Munn made no reply . That 's all it is ; they do n't mean no harm , ' the man continued . They 're just showing they got their teeth in . ' To the east the flames were lower now , but still strong . There was no more sound of gunfire . The last sporadic shots , faint to the north and south , had ceased . The arc-lamp hummed . Down the street a small group of men came out of a doorway.  |p287With  surprise Mr. Munn saw the three women with them . The men held the women by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from running away he could not tell . It 's Burrus , ' a man said . He 's taking the ladies back to the telephone office . ' The women had entered a building down the street , the buildingwith the telephone office in it , Mr. Munn figured . That means it 's about time , he thought , for us to be pulling out . The men who had escorted the women disappeared into an alley . Mr. Munn looked at his watch . It would be about another five minutes , he decided . Burrus and his men came out of the alley , on horseback now , and moved toward the corner . Mr. Burrus lifted his hand in salute as he passed . We 're pulling out , ' he announced . Good night , ' Mr. Munn said . Mr. Burrus and his men cantered off up the street . The sound of the hoofs died away , and they were lost to view . Mr. Munn turned in his saddle . The men regarded him , their faces with the white cloths shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lifted his revolver and fired into the air , once . Benton Todd and the man named Allen were coming toward the corner . Mr. Munn motioned to the two men guarding the prisoners in the doorway . They approached , and mounted their horses . The three men whom they had been guarding remained , halfhiddenin the shadow . Mr. Munn walked his horse to the spot , and looked down at them . The man who had snuffled and had said that his wife was sick stood behind the other two . Come on out , ' Mr. Munn ordered . You all can go now . ' They came out , the last man somewhat hesitantly . You can get on home now to that sick wife you have n't got , ' Mr. Munn said . The man raised his face , mottled and empty in the uncertain light , and ran his tongue over his lips . Suddenly , looking atp288him , Mr. Munn hated him . He felt the blind impulse to cause him pain , to show his hatred , to torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get away from here ! Go on ! Quick ! ' The man backed away a couple of steps , his face still raised emptily , then turned and fled . The other two men were already gone . Mr. Munn lifted his arm . Let 's go , ' he said loudly , and lifted his mare to a gallop . The men swung in behind him . As they went out of town , all of the houses were dark . But inside of them , he knew , there were the people . They lay in their beds , listening , staring up into the dark . Or they peered from the darkened windows . At the top of the slope outside of town , he looked back . The glow of the fires still lingered . But the flames were down . It was some fifteen minutes later , a couple of hundred yards beyond the place where four of the men had turned off into a side lane to go home , that he first thought he heard the sound of hoofs behind him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , not much later , he was sure , or almost sure . He could hear , he thought , the hollow tattoo on a wooden bridge which they had crossed just a little earlier . Do you hear anything ? ' he demanded . I do n't reckon I do , ' Mr. Simmons replied ; nothing special . ' Cantering along , Mr. Munn strained his ears . He tried to sort out the sounds . There was the sound of the horses in his own band , and that other sound , if there was another sound . He was sure , then he was not sure . It was not reasonable , he thought . He knew that he was the last out of town . Then he said loudly , Stop ! ' The horsemen grouped compactly in the middle of the pike . Can you hear anything ? ' he asked . Anything coming ? ' For a moment , no one answered , then a man said , Maybe . I ai n't sure . ' He slipped from his saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his ear to the earth . The other men peeredp289down at him . He rose quickly , and said , Yeah , yeah , somebody'scoming . ' Yes ? ' Mr. Munn demanded . Horses , ' the man declared , and a lot of ' em . ' Mr. Munn scanned the sky . It was a little lighter now . It was not dawn , but the clouds were thinning . Some of our boys going home , ' a man suggested . No , ' Mr. Munn said , we 're the last out . Out this way , anyhow . ' We could bushwhack ' em , ' a man proposed , get behind that fence and let ' em ride past and bushwhack ' em . ' No , ' Mr. Munn decided . A fight wo n't do us any good . Come on ! ' He leaned forward and the mare responded beneath him . Beside him and behind him the hoofs pounded the hard pike . The wind flapped his hat-brim . The fields and woods were black on each side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pike . If they could make it to the New Bethany crossroads with a decent lead , they could , Mr. Munn was sure , throw off the pursuers . They 'd have a chance , a good chance in that tangle of lanes there in that locality and in the woods . If they had a decent lead . But they had to have a lead , because there , toward the crossroads , the pike ran straight and the patch of country was open , and now , momently it seemed to Mr. Munn as he raised his face in the wind and looked fleetingly at the sky , the dim light that seeped through the breaking clouds was increasing . But it was not yet dawn . There ought to be more than two hours till dawn , he figured . Out of the tail of his eye he noticed that Mr. Simmons , who rode beside him , was looking back . He looked back over his shoulder . His men were no longer compactly together . They were stringing out down the pike behind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mr. Munn said aloud , some of those plugs wo n't last to Bethany . ' No better than plow horses , he thought disgustedly , irritably.  |p290This  keeps up , ' Mr. Simmons was shouting at him , and they 'll be taking some of the boys . ' Mr. Munn shook his head . No , ' he denied , not that . ' Better bushwhack ' em while we got a chance , ' the other called . We still got some cover here . ' Mr. Munn glanced to one side of the pike . It was winding here . Through brush and the black cedar thickets . That palenessagainst the darkness of the thicket would be stone wall . Limestone . Here was cover . Good cover , if they were going to bushwhack . He shook his head . No , ' he repeated , not looking toward Mr. Simmons , but forward strainingly toward the next turn in the pike as though his own intensity might draw all the mass behind him , and himself , more swiftly toward the security of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , he again looked back . The men were stringingout behind . Worse than before , he thought . And in his mind he cursed the fools who were pursuing , fools who had no part , no real interest , no concern , with the whole business , idle , swaggering smart alecks , or fellows with some miserable little job with the companies , hangers-on at the depot , at the hotel , fools who stood on the street corners and felt big . The bastards , the bastards , ' he whispered over and over , cursing them , feeling trapped and betrayed . And they were gaining , he knew they were gaining . They would have fresher horses . Better horses . The last chance , ' Mr. Simmons shouted , against the wind of their passage , if we 're gon na bushwhack ' em . ' Mr. Munn shook his head . He did not look back . He did not dare , thinking how the last men would be leaning forward , with their eyes glued on the vague figures fleeing ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the pursuers clawed at their backs . He took the last bend . There was the straight stretch to New Bethany Church . Beyond the church the roads divided , thep291lanes dropped off into the creek bottom , and into the woods . If they could make it there , they could go back along those lanes , into the woods , in the darkness where on the padded earth a hoof would make no sound , and they could separate , and the pursuers would waver and hesitate and would not know what to do , for no man among them would want to be apart from the others . But before that , there was the straight stretch . It seemed more open than he had remembered , and longer . And a luminousness seemed to come from the ground there , to make everything plain there , the pike , the bare fields , the rail fences . The rail fences . Like the tumbled rail fence , he thought in a flash , in that open spot at Murray Mill that night , that open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across it , so innocently , dangerously empty and so light . He did not hear the first shot . Mr. Simmons shouted at him , They 're shooting now ! ' I did n't hear them . ' burn , I did n't neither , ' Mr. Simmons answered ; I heard the bullet go past me . ' Then Mr. Munn did hear a report . One of the men was firing in answer . No good , ' Mr. Simmons called , them durn little six-guns ; they got rifles . ' Mr. Munn thought that he heard a bullet pass his head . But he was n't sure . He heard the reports of the revolvers . Oughter bushwhacked ' em ! ' Mr. Simmons was yelling . It looked so far to the church . You could scarcely see it ahead . And all the pike and the fields and the fences were so plain in that light that seemed to come upward out of the earth . Mr. Simmons was shouting , Them bastards kill me , Munn , and ' fore God , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiteness against dark trees , crawled toward them . It crawled , painfully . Behind , the revolvers popped irrelevantly , flatly . The hoofs drummed the hard pike ,  |p292Then  , as though with surprise , he observed that they were even with the church . There were the crossroads , the forked lanes toward the fords at the creek , the woods and the dense darkness . They were past the church . He swung down the nearest lanes , blindly , hoping that the mare would manage her footing . They plunged across the shallow waters of the ford , and the splashing from the horse next to him drenched him to the thigh . But he felt nothing . Ten yards beyond the ford he pulled into the protection of the trees . Hurry ! ' he called sharply , hurry ! ' and was not sure that his own voice was speaking , for it seemed calm , not the voice that should belong to him at the moment . Hurry ! Get off ! You Simmons , Allen , Snyder , get the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ford , cut down on them . ' He stared toward the ford . The water glinted dimly there . He felt the heaving of the mare 's breath between his knees . But they wo n't , ' he said . They 're afraid . They wo n't come down there , and come across . ' He slid from the saddle , staggering almost when his feet touched the earth . They did not come to the ford . He kept his eyes fixed on the spot . Twice there was an uneven volley from the direction of the pike . He could hear some of the bullets , very high , whippingthrough the twigs and the cedar fronds . Do n't shoot , ' he told the men . Do n't shoot unless they try the ford . ' Then , after a little while , after he was sure that the men at the pike had gone , he heard a voice say , soberly , I got hit . ' What ? ' Mr. Munn demanded . Where are you ? ' He had not recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had been , saying , I got hit . ' Here , ' the voice answered . Here I am . ' Mr. Munn moved gropingly in the darkness of the cedars . Strike a match , somebody , ' another voice said . A match flared , then another . A man holding a match was kneeling beside a shape on the ground . Mr. Munn saw that.  |p293The  match flickered quickly out . He moved toward the spot where it had been . They struck more matches , the other men , and leaned over the shape on the ground . Then they managed to make a torch . The man on the ground , Mr. Munn saw , was Benton Todd . Where 's he hit ? ' Mr. Munn demanded . Up in the leg , ' a man said , just in the leg . ' He held a clasp knife and was trying to slit the trousers off Benton Todd 's leg . The trousers were sodden with blood . Another man was fumblingat the boot , and muttering irritably , God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that light closer ? ' But the man with the torch did not hear , apparently , for he was leaning forward with his gaze fixed on Benton Todd 's face . It did n't hurt much , ' Benton Todd said detachedly . Mr. Munn did not recognize the voice . But I did n't know it was going to bleed so much . ' Do n't you worry , boy , do n't you worry , ' the man cutting off the trousers uttered , we 'll get it off , we 'll get you fixed up in no time . No time a-tall . ' Benton Todd seemed to be paying no attention , now , to the men about him . He was looking upward , beyond the torch and the clustered faces enclosed in that fading bulb of light of which the torch was the center , and beyond the cedar boughs . The torch flame was reflected tinnily in his eyes . Gimmie a knife , I ca n't get it off , ' the man at the boot complainedpeevishly ; it 's all stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another man pushed him aside , and began cutting at the leather . The man who had been working at the boot raised his own hands into the torchlight , covered with blood and muck , and with an expression of distrust and solicitude inspectedthem , as though they , too , were wounded . I think ' Benton Todd said , somewhat tiredly , not looking at the men , you better try to stop it . ' They were putting a belt around the wounded thigh , whichp294was now naked . The blood welled out of the small puncture there , and flowed darkly , but glintingly , over the white flesh . They drew the belt as tight as possible , and they packed handkerchiefson top , and under the wound beneath , where the bullet had entered . Two of the men had taken off their shirts and were tearing them into strips . The handkerchiefs soaked up the blood , soggily . Bent , Bent , ' Mr. Munn called , leaning . Hey , Bent ! Listen here Laboriously , Benton Todd directed his gaze upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dully . That blood , ' he said , it came out of me . ' Mr. Munn could not remember what he had intended to say . Benton Todd 's remote , incurious , gnomic gaze withdrew , left him , sought again the darkness of the cedar boughs above . Benton Todd bled to death while they leaned over him and watched him . They could not stop the blood , which seemed to well prodigally and inexhaustibly from that small aperture . One of the men held his hand to Benton Todd 's chest . He straightened up , and said , ' Ile 's a goner . ' He looked at Mr. Munn . All right , all right , ' Mr. Munn rejoined , as though irritably . It 'll be tough tiddy for the Captain , ' one of the men remarked . The men crowded around the body , and leaned over it , and peered down at it . The torch was guttering out . For a moment or two no one spoke . Tough tiddy , ' another man said , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though rousing from a sleep . Listen , ' he directed , some of you all get a buggy . Get the first one you can find . It do n't matter whose . And start on toward Captain Todd 's place . That left road down at the church will take you across to his pike . We 'll catch you . ' Catch us ? ' somebody echoed , inquiringly . I 'll be glad to have as many as want to come with me , ' Mr.p295Munn offered . I 'm not ordering anybody , understand . I want those who come of their own free will . ' You aiming to chase ' em ? ' Cut them off , ' Mr. Munn said shortly . We can cut them off before they hit town . The road this lane here joins , we can take it , and hit the pike before they make town . ' No one answered , for a moment . Then a voice : Dammit , you did n't want to bushwhack ' em back there on the pike when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good , and you want-er go and fight . ' I just want those who come of their own free will , ' Mr. Munn answered. burn if you do n't beat me , ' the voice exclaimed . Now , ' Mr. Munn added . All right , ' the voice said fatalistically , all right , I 'll go . ' Just before the first signs of dawn , Mr. Munn and seven other men lay behind a tumbled stone wall beside the pike , considerablyless than a mile out of town , and fired carefully into a mass of mounted men on the pike . The men had been riding slowly along , idly lounging in their saddles and laughing and joking with each other . At the first volley , the mounted men , some thirty of them , broke and fled down the pike toward town . Two bodies were left lying in the middle of the pike . Later , when the panic wore off , the men returned from town and got the bodies of the two dead men . Three other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sit their horses . Mr. Munn , alone , for the other men who had lain behind the stone wall with him had now gone home , overtook the party that was escorting the buggy with the corpse of Benton Todd . He overtook them a few hundred yards south of the entrance to the Todd place . They had had a hard time getting a buggy , they told him , and they asked what had happened . We had a little brush with them , ' he said.  |p296Did  you all hit any of ' em ? ' Mr. Allen demanded . Yes , ' Mr. Munn answered abstractedly , riding alongside the buggy and watching the bare foot , which protruded from the blanket-wrapped bundle propped in the seat , jog uneasily with the motion of the vehicle . When they got to the gate , Mr. Munn said that he would ride on ahead . The men looked at each other relievedly , but answerednothing . He grasped the pull-rope that worked the gate , and the gate swung open , and he urged his tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just back of the house , over the woodlot , a saffron light streaked the lowest clouds . Mr. Munn leaned against the doorpost , and knocked . The mare stood in the yard , her forefeet wide apart , and her head drooping . He looked at her , and waited for the sound of steps within . His clothes felt like lead weighing upon his shoulders . Captain Todd , wearing trousers and a coat , which he held together under his chin with one hand , stood in the open doorway and looked at him . Benton , ' Mr. Munn managed . Then : Benton , he -- He is n't staying here , ' Captain Todd said . He has n't been staying here for several weeks . I ca n't precisely say where you 'd find him ' His gaze passed beyond Mr. Munn . Then , slowly , he fixed his eyes upon Mr. Munn 's face , and as he stared , his head twitched , almost imperceptibly , from side to side . Mr. Munn , with an effort of will , turned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clearly in the new light that was rapidly suffusing those pastures and fields and bringing into familiar certainty the features of all the landscape beyond.  |p297THE  troops came on a special train that reached the Bardsville depot late in the afternoon . For two hours before the arrival , a gradually increasing crowd congested the waiting-rooms and lounged along the platforms of the depot . It was an unusually mild afternoon for even so late in January , and many of the men did not wear overcoats . Those who did wear overcoats let them hang loosely unbuttoned or thrust them jauntily back , and stood on their heels with their hands in the pockets of their trousers . The sun shone brightly , making the double set of tracks along the platform gleam like burnished silver , and flashing on the wings of the white pigeons that wove familiarly back and forth against the blue clarity of the sky or lighted on the gravel beside the platform to peck , with a dignified condescension , at the grains of popcorn which people threw to them . When the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely noticed , not taking wing , and merely eyed the disturbers . A child , a little boy of some six or seven , first observed the approaching train . He stood in the middle of the tracks , with his right arm rigidly pointing northward , and screamed , The soldiers , the soldiers , the soldiers ! ' until a woman came and drew him to the platform , and slapped him sharply on both cheeks . She was a pale , thin , poorly dressed woman , and when her son had ceased his screams of excitement and only whimpered , she looked around at the nearest people and said in an explanatory , apologetic tone : It looks like he just will get all worked up like that and carry on . It looks like children , the more ' But her voice trailed off , for no one was listening top298her . Everyone was straining to see the train . The other children had congregated on the tracks , staring northward , where the little plume of black smoke hanging above the cut seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the stilldistantwhistle , they merged into the expectant crowd on the platform . At last , flecking off steam like spittle , roaring and grinding on the polished steel of the rails , shaking the boards of the platformwith the vibrations of its mass , scattering the pigeons in a crazy , tumultuous flock , the locomotive pulled past , and there , drawing to a stop , were the coaches , and within them , pressed to the glass of the windows , those peering , inquisitive faces that seemed , all of them , all alike under the brown , wide-brimmed hats . The train stopped . The conductor descended , somewhat warily , with his eyes fixed on the crowd . Then , as though reassured , he planted his feet firmly , wide apart , on the gravel , and surveyed the faces . But no one was watching him . The people were watching a large , red-faced man , in uniform , who seemed oblivious to them while he descended the steps , as though the descent required infinite care , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , successfully , that enormous belly , over which the tan cloth was buttoned and buckled to bursting . Just as his foot touched the gravel , and he raised his eyes , blinkingly and unresponsively , toward the people , the small brass band at the far end of the platform drove into the initial strains of The Star-Spangled Banner . ' Blinkingly , the large man saluted , and the younger man descending behind him paused on the last step and saluted . As the music exploded on its last note , a man separated himself from the crowd and rushed toward the officer , his hand extended in greeting and his smile exposing the liberal amount of gold among his prominent teeth . Major Pottle ? ' he inquired loudly . The large man nodded , and said , Yes , sir . '  |p299I  'm the mayor , ' the other man explained , Mayor Alton , to be exact , and I welcome you and your men . ' They shook hands , and the mayor , leaning confidentially and insinuatingly toward the large red-faced man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so subdued a tone that the nearest persons in the crowd , no matter how hard they strained , could not understand a word . The major looked straight ahead of him unseeingly , as though he heard nothing and were absorbed in his own inward processes , and slowly blinked his pale blue , protruding eyes . The men climbed down from the coaches and were formed in company front on the open stretch at the south end of the platform . There were two companies of infantry . The stock cars with the cavalry horses were switched to a siding , and the cavalry men began unloading . All the while the band was playing . The train pulled out ; the soldiers remaining on it leaned from the windows and waved back . They were on their way to Morganstown . The next day one of the companies of infantry and a squadron of cavalry from the force at Bardsville were to be marched to French Springs , eleven miles away , where there was no railroad . Mayor Alton , clutching Major Pottle by the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the platform , the officer 's unwieldy bulk moving slowly , but unprotestingly , almostsomnambulantly , as though in the grip of a superior will . The mayor , with a kind of creaking and exaggerated nimbleness , clambered onto the baggage truck , and extended a hand to assist Major Pottle . But Major Pottle ignored the hand . He clutched the edge of the truck with both hands , placed one foot on the tongue of the truck , and with his neck reddening above the collar and his pale eyes bulging , heaved himself upward . He rose to his feet asthmatically , and stood beside Mayor Alton , who at that moment extended his arms to still the music , and began to speak . Friends and fellow citizens , ' he began , to say that peace isp300returned to our distracted community , is today my happiness . If  --  and I say this with both sadness and pride  --  my request for military assistance had been granted that sad and fateful morning when we awoke to find in ruins the properties and investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other factor , contribute to the happiness and prosperityof our thriving community ; if my judgment had been heeded , if then Shut yore mouth ' fore you fall in hit , ' a voice called from the crowd . If then , ' Mr. Alton proceeded , my request had been granted , our sister communities , which likewise have suffered from the torch of the accursed vandals ' Mr. Christian laid his hand on Mr. Munn 's shoulder , and leaned toward his ear . By God , ' he whispered , I do believe that snaggle-toothed bastard is talking about me. '  --  would have been spared the tragic blows that befell them . But now we can see that peace has returned to us . Now the loved ones of those two gallant lads who gave their young lives to avenge the fair name of their city will feel that the sacrifice will not have been offered up in vain . And the man who is bringing us peace now stands beside me . He is Major Pottle . Ladies and gentlemen , I introduce to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Old Tub-o ' - guts ! ' a voice yelled from the back of the crowd . Let old Tub-o ' - guts talk ! ' Mr. Alton waved his arms furiously and screamed : Get that man , get him ! Arrest him ! ' The two policemen , who had been lounging at the edge of the platform , tried to thrust their way into the crowd , but it was impossible . Get him ! ' Mr. Alton screamed , and waved his arms in the direction of the troops . There the troops stood , motionless , erect , their rifles grounded , the bright sunshine falling upon them . They did not move . The policemen were swallowed up in the crowd.  |p301All  the while Major Pottle gave no sign . He might have been alone , staring owlishly at nothing , puffing his slow breath out between his meaty lips . When the disturbance had subsided , he said that he appreciated the hospitality of Bardsville and he wanted to thank the good people and he was sure he and his men would enjoy their stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , almost in the middle of a sentence , as though he had merely been thinking aloud and now the thoughts were grinding on , slowly and ponderously , inside his head while he blinked at some object far away beyond the people . Mr. Alton was gesturing and beckoning to someone in the crowd below him . The crowd wavered and parted there , and Senator Tolliver was assisted to mount the baggage truck . He shook hands with Mr. Alton and with Major Pottle . Mr. Alton thanked Major Pottle for his kind words and said that now he would call for a few appropriate remarks from a distinguished citizen who in the recent distressing situation had , as always , taken a firm stand in favor of law and truth and right . The skunk , ' Mr. Christian said , scarcely bothering to whisper . Mr. Alton waved his arm in the direction of the Senator . Which one ? ' Mr. Munn demanded . Take your pick , ' Mr. Christian replied glumly . Senator Tolliver was speaking , but Mr. Munn hardly attended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing that man who now stood there on the baggage truck , somewhat stooped , sallow , graying splotchily , with the man who had stood on the platform , under the bright bunting and the brilliant sunshine , that day of the first rally . When Senator Tolliver had first got up there on the baggage truck , Mr. Munn had felt , looking at him , the firmness of the hatred within himself . With relish , he had been aware of it , it was still there , strong and solid and sure within , something he could depend on and cling to , somethingreal , the same thing which he had held in his mind , P3O2cherishingly , on waking at night , as one fingers a token or a keepsake , which is nothing in itself , but which means the reality of one 's past , the truth of one 's feelings , the fact of one 's identity . The hatred was there now , perfect and safe within , something to hold to . For a moment or two the Senator 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been that August afternoon ; then it would falter . He was afraid . Mr. Munn , looking at him , was sure he was afraid . He could no longer look out over the massed faces and master them . Instead , he cringed before them , fawning for a momentary favor , grateful , and showing that he was grateful , for a respite . Or he was , an instant later , suspicious of them , and almost sullen , anxious to be done and gone . Or he tried to bully them . Or worse  --  and Mr. Munn was almost embarrassed as he listened  --  he tried to vindicate himself , saying he had always followed the best interest , or what he took to be the best interest , of his section as his guiding star , ' that if he had made mistakes , the mistakes had come from loyalty and zeal  --  that he wished to be understood , and to be clear before all men . Clear in my office , he said . You ai n't got no office ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped on the boards and on the gravel . My God , Mr. Munn thought , he 's not the same man , it 's a different man . The crowd was stirring uneasily . And I , Mr. Munn thought suddenly , with a shocking clarity , not hearingthat voice nor noticing the people , I 'm not the same man . He hung poised on the brink of that thought , as on the brink of a blackness . It seemed to draw him , intoxicatingly , as with a new surety . But slowly , with an effort of will almost , he recoiledfrom its fascination . He forced himself to look at the objects about him . At the back of the man 's head in front of him , at Mr. Christian 's flushed , heavy jowled face , now sullen and brooding . And to listen to that voice . To its cringing , its fawning , its bullying , its lying , its hopelessness , its fear . All ofp303those things were in the voice , and in the sallow face and stooped shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice went on . The crowd wavered , and to the man leaning over it , talking to it hurriedly and uncertainly , it must have been like the earth along some precipitous trail , the earth , usually so firm and comfortable , that under the frightened foot stirs treacherously , twitching like the hide of a somnolent beast that may wake to leap . Like the beast or like the landslide . Both were there , Mr. Munn felt , in the crowd . The Senator was saying :  --  and I say this to you , my friends , for you are my friends , and I count no higher privilege than the privilege of saying to this body of people now before me , you are my friends  --  I say this to you , my friends ' Mr. Munnthought : He has no friends , not even the people who bought him out , body and soul , lock , stock , and barrel . Nobody up there in that big house now . Not those people from Louisville and Washington , any more . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , Senator  --  yes , sir , Senator , for a couple of drinks and a ten-cent cigar  --  there is no finer thing than friendship , friendship and loyalty , loyalty to one 's friends , loyalty to one 's ideals . When I am dead  --  but I hope and trust our Almighty Father to grant me further years of service to the people of my section  --  open my heart , and in the words of the poet , you will find graven upon itThe bastard , Mr. Munn thought . Then , the poor bastard . That night , the night following the afternoon of the arrival of the troops at Bardsville , the two warehouses at French Springs were dynamited and burned , and the long , old , woodencoveredbridge over the river there was dynamited . Some people said that it had been mined to be blown up when the troops came over the next day from Bardsville , and that the explosion that night was an accident . They said it was God 's providence ,  |p304saving  the lives of all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than schoolboys , and hog-friendly if you 'd let them . The bridge had not been mined . It was blown up by ten sticks of dynamite , two packages of five sticks each , attached to the lower part of the central stone pier . At the blast the pier had toppled over , the old stonework disintegrating into a heap of rubble , about which ' the waters , when the last echoes had died away between the high banks , lapped lullingly . The wooden superstructure , as it lay crumpled up on its side , had been fired . It burned slowly , but to the water 's edge , like an abandoned hulk , no longer seaworthy . But while the men had been out in a skiff preparing to affix the two charges of dynamite to the pier , Doctor MacDonald , on horseback at a gap in the timber and heavy growth that lined the steep banks , had looked down at the undulating blackness of the water and at the long , poised , undifferentiated mass of the bridge stretching across to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had musingly ' said , It would n't be hard , you know , to figure out some way . ' Some way to do what ? ' a man had demanded . To do it when they were coming over , ' Doctor MacDonald had answered , still musingly . A man could figure it out , all right . ' No one had answered . I was n't really suggesting anything , ' Doctor MacDonald had said , and had laughed once , briefly , in the darkness . I was just sorter figuring . ' Looking down the bank , Mr. Munn had thought , yes , and there 's good cover along here . It got so a man 's mind ran that way . The roar of the explosion up at the settlement a half-mile away had come . The men from the skiff had clambered up the bank . Doctor MacDonald and the others had lifted their reins . With a boom , and a sound of grinding that filled the air , the bridge had heaved upward , and over . It had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind them . slowly , the flames had mounted as they galloped up the pike . That night , also , Monclair , the home of Senator Tolliver , was burned to the ground . The men who fired it were unknown . When Doctor MacDonald heard the news by telephone the next morning , his surprise was complete . Deliberately , he replaced the receiver upon its hook , but as he turned from the instrument , his face was drawn and white with fury , and his hands , hanging from the corded wrists , clenched and unclenched . Monclair was the first dwelling-house to be burned . The Munn place was the second . Despite the threatening letters which he had received and which Mr. Murdock and Mr. Sills had received , Mr. Munn had not anticipated the act . Others , he guessed , had also received such letters and had said nothing about them . He had never mentioned the letters which he himself had received . Not a week before that night at Professor Ball 's academy , the night when Doctor MacDonald read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received such a letter . That letter had directed him to take no negro tenants for the coming year . Sitting in his office , at his desk , he had read the scrawled words . The paper was torn and dirty , a scrap of wrapping paper , apparently . The writing was smeared , as though the paper had been carried loose in a pocket . The letter had been mailed , the postmark indicated , from Morganstown . Sitting there , Mr. Munn had , for a moment , tried to visualize the man who might have written the letter : a man gripping the cracked stub of a penny pencil , hunching over a kitchen table under a tin lamp , twisting his face in the painful and awkward concentration . But he had not been able to visualize that face , a face , he had been sure , like so many of those faces which he might see on the street on a Saturday afternoon , long , bony , red like dried clay , or sallow , a face like faces which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Associa/tion . It had been , in his imagination , like all those faces . But he had not been able to fix it and be sure of it , for the true face would not be like any other face ; it would be different from all those other faces , individual , positive , unique , full of its own life , its own cunning , its own hope , bitterness , appetite , and hatred . Slowly , he had torn the sheet of paper into small bits , and had dropped them into the basket beside his desk . The third and last letter he found in the mailbox at his farm . It read : We done told you twict to throw them niggers off yore place and put some white min on like we said and you ai nt done it . Instid you go and git shet of a white man which is named Grimes and put on a nigger in his place . We give you thre days to git shet of them black bastuds . ' Mr. Munn read the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then looked up the long drive across the meadow to the grove where the house was . The grove , except for the dark masses of the cedars , was leafless now , and the upper part of the house was visible . For five nights he slept with a loaded rifle propped at the head of the bed . At first he considered getting one of the men to come up and stay at the house with him , one of them who had been on the place a long time , one he could depend on , but he dismissed the idea . It was n't their trouble , he decided ; and decided that , after all , nobody would bother him , that the letters were a meaningless threat . He did , however , put one of the dogs in the house each night , giving it the run of the front hall , the back hall , and the kitchen , for if anybody tried to fire the house he would probably begin with the porches , the only wooden parts exposed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the house , even if the dog outside were disposed of before giving an alarm . During those five nights Mr. Munn would wake , thinking that a sound had disturbed him . He would take the rifle and creep to a window to peer out over the dark-dappled yard , where thep307trees were , toward the open ground of the meadow . There would be nothing , or nothing but those sounds which were so much a part of the night that they were nothing . Then he would go back and climb into the big bed , and try to go to sleep . He could not go back to sleep readily , no matter how tired he had been upon first getting to bed . Things would come to his mind , faces and speculations and events from the past that crowded through his head with a clamorous and independent vigor above his will , crowding devouringly and aimlessly like a mob breaking at last into a locked mansion . Those things , it seemed to him , must go on and on living their independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplings and with new variations . They must go incessantly on like the distractedwater of the sea , shifting and retreating and approachingand shattering itself and rejoining , while he slept or while his attention was torn from them by the demands of the day . He would think of May . He rarely thought of her when he was elsewhere , but here in this room , often . She was part of this room , more of a part of it than he was now ; for he had grown away from it ; he felt like a stranger in it now except at those unstablemoments when the past flooded obliteratingly over the present . Once , upon waking and sitting up in bed , he seemed , by some trick of the light or trick of the mind , to see her there sleeping . How small she had been sleeping , with her life withdrawndeeply within her , small and curled up , like a child almost , and with her pale hair out on the pillow . The sixth and seventh nights after receiving the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , for court was in session , and he had a case coming to trial . Both mornings , immediately after getting up , he telephoned his place , but nothing had happened . If they had been going to carry out the threat , he began to feel , they would have done it already . He spent the eighth night at the Christian place . That night his house was burned down.  |p308That  night the jangling of the telephone bell over and over drew him from the light doze into which he had fallen . As he tried to decipher the sequence of the rings , Lucille Christian suddenly laid her hand on his shoulder and said , Two longs and three shorts , that 's our ring . ' She sat up in bed . Wonder what it is ? ' he said . Be quiet , ' she ordered . Papa 's getting up . ' Motionless , they listened to the sounds in the next room , the sudden rasping of a chair on the floor , then steps , and the creakingof a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered to Mr. Munn . Her fingers were tight on his shoulder , pressing into the flesh . Wait till he gets downstairs , ' he said . The telephone 's just at the foot of the steps , ' she answered . If he 's looking this way he 'll see me . ' She slipped out of bed , put on her kimono , and hurriedly tied the big sash . Leaning toward the door , she said , He 's talking now , I can hear him . ' Mr. Munn got out of bed . Then , there was the heavy sound of Mr. Christian 's feet hurryingup the stairs , and his voice calling , Terse ! Perse ' The girl stood rigidly in the middle of the room , then she motioned toward the door . Go to the door , ' she ordered , stop him . I ca n't get out , ' and she darted toward the corner of the room between the door and the windows , and flattened herself there against the wall in the deepest shadow . Mr. Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , a whiteness there in the corner , but he could not make out its expression . Mr. Christian was beating on the door and calling , Terse ! Perse ! ' Mr. Munn opened the door . The telephone , ' Mr. Christian exclaimed , they want you on the telephone , your house , they say Mr. Munn seized Mr. Christian by the arm and drew him intop309the hall . All right , ' he said , and ran down the stairs toward the telephone . Mr. Christian stood at the head of the stairs looking down at him . With his eyes fixed on Mr. Christian 's figure there above him , Mr. Munn picked up the dangling receiver , and spoke into the telephone . Yes ? ' he demanded . It was one of the negroes from his place , breathless and gaspingas from running and incoherent with excitement . The house , the negro managed to say , was burning up . It was almostgone now . He had run as hard as he could over to Mr. Goodwood 's place to call up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his room , seized his clothes and boots , and came back to the door to block Mr. Christian just at the sill . Out of the corner of his eye he had caught sight of Lucille Christian still pressed against the wall in her corner . He dressed standing there at the doorway , blocking it , while Mr. Christian waited in the hall . My house is burning up , ' he told Mr. Christian . How was it ? ' Mr. Christian demanded . They tried to make me get rid of the negro croppers on my place , ' Mr. Munn said . I would n't do it , so they burned the house down . ' You want me to come with you ? ' No , ' Mr. Munn replied . There 's nothing you can do . Or me , either , I reckon . But '  --  and he looked up an instant from lacing his boot  --  let me find out who it was and ' His voice trailed off . He tied the laces . Let me find out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs . Very loudly , Mr. Munn called , You 're going to lock up after me , are n't you ? ' That , he thought , would give Lucille Christian her chance . No , ' Mr. Christian answered , it do n't need it . ' As he rode away , Mr. Munn cursed himself for his stupidity in not letting Mr. Christian come with him . That might havep310made it easy for Lucille Christian . Or again , it might not . Mr. Christian might have wanted to go to her room to tell her he was leaving . Then he thought he should have asked Mr. Christian to saddle his mare for him . That would have worked it . But Mr. Christian would go on back to bed , now . That would fix everything . It was near sun when he reached his place . The flames had been down for a considerable time , but the heap of smouldering timbers still winked palely in the gathering dawn . One of the cedars nearest the house had caught fire and had burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke , straight upward . Over at one side a group of negroes were standing about , looking at the ruins . On the other side , two men held the bridles of some saddled horses , and closer to the ruins a group of men stood . They were cavalrymen . The lieutenant who was in charge introduced himself . He was named Prentiss , he said ; and he just wanted to find out if Mr. Munn had any idea about the burning and if he had had any threats or anything like that . Mr. Munn said no , there had been no threats , that the whole matter might be an accident . The lieutenant said that that was n't likely , that it was night riders all right , because one of the negroes had seen three or four men riding off across the meadow , lickety-split . Mr. Munn shrugged his shoulders . I do n't know anything about it , ' he said . After a while some of the negroes began to move off . The children had grown sleepy and querulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Munn looked at the stuff the negroeshad managed to save , only a few pieces of furniture from the downstairs , the sofa , a couple of chairs , a picture off the wall . When the first man had waked up , at the sound of a dog barking , they said , the fire was already coming out the upstairs windows . A good part of the walls of the house were still standing . Thep311walls toward the corner where his bedroom had been were almostintact . Looking up at them , he thought , aimlessly , of himself and of other people before him sleeping in that room , protected by those walls , cut off by those walls from the weather and the night outside , and the world . Those walls had made a little world inside . That world was gone now . It was gone , liberated and absorbed into the air outside , dissipated in the flame and smoke . He was not sad at the fact . Now that it was a fact , now that the thing was done , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown used to . He had not realized before , before he stood there to observe the gray ash flake off the smouldering timbers and a last few wisplike flames flutter outward , and then withdraw , how tenuous had grown the threads that tied him to the life , and the lives , that had been in that house . The young lieutenant came over to stand beside him . Tough luck , ' the lieutenant remarked , losing your house like that . ' He looked meditatively at the ruins . And a right nice house too , it looks like . ' He paused again , then asked , Were you raised here ? ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said . The crummy bastards , ' the lieutenant exclaimed , burning a man 's house down . ' I reckon so , ' Mr. Munn remarked . I 'm sorry we did n't get here in time to do any good . ' Thanks , ' Mr. Munn replied . We got to be pulling out , ' the lieutenant observed . Goodbye , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with him . He had n't noticed the fellow 's face before . It struck him as vaguely familiar . Good-bye , ' he answered . I know how you feel , ' the lieutenant said . You must feel tough . ' The cavalrymen mounted and rode off across the meadow . Mr. Munn watched them go . No , he decided , the lieutenantp312was wrong . He did n't feel tough . That was not it . There was no word to name it with , exactly . He went down to Old Mac 's cabin , and sat on the chunk of limestone that was the step , while Mac 's wife cooked him some breakfast . After a while she called him in and gave him three eggs fried up with some side meat , and some hoecake and coffee . He ate with a good enough appetite . While he ate he remembered how the young lieutenant had reminded him of somebody . He turned that over in his mind . Then he had the answer . The fellow reminded him a little of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got through eating , he rode on back to town . There was nothing else he could do out at his place , and , besides , he had the case coming up . When he got to his office , the girl there said for him to call the Christian place right away , that they had been calling for him all morning . He reckoned that Mr. Christian wanted to get the news about the burning . He ' had trouble getting on the line , and when he did get on he had to wait a long time before the ncgro cook out there called somebody to the telephone . Lucille Christian came . Her father , she said when she finally came to the telephone , had had a stroke , and she was afraid he was going to die . The voice that spoke to him out of the black tube which he pressed coldly against his ear was alien to him . But Mr. Christian did not die  --  not soon . He lay beneath the high , carved headboard of his bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dry rasp of his measured and grudgingbreath . His face , now splotchy in its color , was frozen in a pained and inquiring grimace , and his glance was fixed . But Mr. Munn did not see him when he went out to the Christianplace . He was never to see him again after that night when he left him standing halfway down the stairs , barefooted , his nightshirt wadded into his trousers.  |p313When  he got out to the Christian house that next morning , Lucille Christian met him in the hall . Her face was chalkwhite , and her eyes , no longer blue , seemed dark and sunken . How is he ? ' Mr. Munn asked . Looking at him , with her hair falling half loose about her face , she seemed unable to speak . How is he ? ' he repeated . It was terrible , ' she uttered hoarsely , in a whisper which was as dry and impersonal and alien as the sounds which had come from the telephone receiver . Can I see him ? ' he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase . She did not take her gaze from his face , and her right arm , as though with an independent volition , thrust forward at him . The fingers clutched the fabric of his sleeve , twisting it . No , ' she said . No ! ' No ? ' The grip tightened on his sleeve . It was terrible , ' she whispered retardedly , in that voice . They had quarreled , she finally managed to tell him . Her father had found her . He had come into the room where she was , there was no telling why , but it had seemed as though to look out the front window at Mr. Munn riding off , and he had seen her standing there . She could not remember what he had said . There had been so little time , before it happened . But she could remember his face . She had screamed at him , and his eyes had suddenly popped out and he had opened his mouth like a man trying to call out , but he had n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not yours ! I do n't belong to you ! Or to anybody ! ' When she repeated those words now , in a whisper , the tears rose in her dry , starting eyes . Then , slowly , while her strong fingers twisted the cloth of his coat sleeve , she said : I said thatP314to him . I said that . Oh , Perse , that 's the way I am inside . ' Then : Oh , Perse , you see how I am . ' He tried to put his hands on her , but she withdrew from him . That night , sitting in his room at the hotel , under the single , hanging , unshaded electric bulb that lighted indifferently the worn carpet at his feet , the dresser with its cold-looking mirror , and the bed , Mr. Munn wrote a letter to May . He was sure , he wrote , that she would agree with him that a divorce was the best thing for them under the existing conditions.  |p315THE  pale sunshine washed over the wide boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fixed . Professor Ball 's voice proceeded :  --  will sing unto the Lord , for He hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider bath He thrown into the sea . The Lord is my strength and song , and He is become my salvation : He is my God , and I will prepare Him an habitation ; my father 's God , and I will exalt Him . The Lord is a man of war : the Lord is his name . Pharaoh 's chariots and his host He held the book in his left hand and his right forefinger traced each line as he read it , pausing at the end of a verse , then moving forward again . He did not lift his glance from the page as he read on through the chapter , but now and then he would close his eyes behind the spectacles , and the forefinger would move on , line by line keeping pace with the uttered words , and the voice would become more emphatic , more rapt .  --  the mighty men of Moab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canaan shall melt away . Fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of Thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till Thy people pass over , 0 Lord , till the people pass over , which Thou halt purchased . ' While he read , the five women , his daughters , who sat in the tall , unvarnished , ladder-backed chairs facing him , never took their eyes off his face . All of them sat with the same posture , erectly and easily , their busts carried high , their hands clasped gently in the lap . The four boys , pupils at the academy , had their heels hooked over the bottom rungs of the chairs , and their heads already bowed , as though in preparation for the prayer that was to come . Cautiously , they glanced up now and then ,  |p316while  Professor Ball 's voice went on , at the blue sky beyond the windows or at the open door of the dining-room , where the table was already laid . Behind the boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor MacDonald cocked lankily back in his chair , his brown hands lying on his knees , his face impassive . From under his slightly lowered eyelids , he was regarding his wife . Her back , as she looked up into her father 's face , was not quite turned to Doctor MacDonald . The line of her cheek and the small , sober arch of her brow were visible . A streak of sunlight fell across her chestnut hair , which was drawn smoothly back to a knot on the nape of her neck . Professor Ball shut the book clumsily with his bandaged hands , pushed his spectacles into a firmer position on his thin nose , and laid the book on the mantelshelf behind him . Creakily , without a word , he sank to his knees , placed the palms of his bandaged hands together before his face , and closed his eyes . The skirt of his long , black coat almost brushed the floor about his knees . The five women , and the others , got to their knees , and bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ball said . It paused ; then resumed . 0 Lord , who art above all things , for all Thy blessingswe thank Thee . And ask for Thy blessing , though in our sins we are not worthy . But in our unworthiness , we call out unto Thee . Thou hast shown Thy power and cast the horse and his rider into the sea , 0 Lord , but desert us not . Thou hast brought us over , 0 Lord , dryshod , but do not let us linger in the wilderness of Shur . Nor taste the waters of Marah , which are bitter , 0 Lord , and which now we taste . 0 Lord , as Thou led out Israel to Elim , lead us now , that we may see the twelve wells of water flowing there , and the three score and ten palm trees . Lead us , 0 Lord , and smite those who would rise against our face . ' His voice stopped , and the slow , brittle sound of his breathing was audible in the room . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thee . Amen . '  |p317He  rose , and standing with his hands propped inertly on the high back of a chair , looked away from the people before him , and out the window , where the morning light fell through the bare branches of trees . The other people began to move about . All of the women exceptone went into the dining-room . The little boys talked to each other in low voices . Portia Ball , who had lingered behind her sisters , said : Breakfast wo n't be ready for about five minutes . I 'll call you all . ' Then she followed the other women into the dining-room , and shut the door . Let 's go outside and get a breath before we eat , ' Doctor MacDonaldsaid to Mr. Munn . Mr. Munn nodded , and followed out into the hall , and to the porch . Doctor MacDonald took out his pipe , packed it , and lighted it . He balanced himself with his toes sticking over the edge of the porch and looked out over the slope toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sky , was wreathing up from one of the two big chimneys there . Doctor MacDonald took his pipe out of his mouth . A lot of praying goes on round here , ' he remarked . Mr. Munn nodded . Yeah , ' Doctor MacDonald went on , that 's a fact . I reckon I 've worn out a right smart carpet with my knee-caps since I married Cordelia . And me not a churchy man , so to speak . Come down to it '  --  he took a drag of the pipe , and slowly , with relish , exhaled the smoke  --  short of being an infidel , and just damning my soul outer pure and unadulterated cantankerousness , you might say I go as far as the next man in wrapping myself in carnal concerns . I 'm not proud of it , but you know how it is ; a lot of things , good and bad , comes closer to a man 's hand than praying and reading in the Book , and a man goes his way . And things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind you , looked like something a little different from the workings of God 's grace . '  |p318I  reckon everybody sees something like that , ' Mr. Munn observed , if he lives half his span . ' Yeah , yeah , ' Doctor MacDonald said abstractedly , a hint of impatience . in his tone , but the things I 've seen done . With my own eyes . Before I hit here , and I reckon I 've seen my share here , too . It looks like those things and getting down on your knees do n't belong in the same world . But take the old Professor , now , he 's been putting me on my knees quite a spell , going on two years now . ' He grinned , looking directly at Mr. Munn . Not that I 'm complaining ; I had some time to make up in that position . Besides , he 's a man for you now , and I respect his ways . ' It 's a comfort to him , I take it , ' Mr. Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pretty hard . ' He paused , then looking off down the slope added glumly , I reckon a man could do with some comfort . ' Well , lately the old man 's been asking the Lord for a pretty special brand of comfort . More my variety than you might take his to be , ' Doctor MacDonald said . It used to be we got the loving-kindness chapters both morning and evening prayers , but lately he 's been asking the Lord to mix in pretty direct and smite the Ammonite . He 's been giving us the blood-letting texts , breakfast and supper . Like this morning , about the horse and his rider . ' Mr. Munn spat off the edge of the porch , and stared at the spot beneath where the splotch of saliva darkened a dried oak leaf . That 'd suit me , ' he said , but there 's so God-damned many horses and riders now over at Bardsville , and Morganstown , and all . I 'd wear out some carpet with my knees , if I reckoned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the hip-and-thigh stuff pretty regular with the Professor for some time now , ' Doctor MacDonald stated . Just the front part of the Book . ' At the sound of the door opening , Mr. Munn turned . Corde/lia MacDonald had come out . It 'll be ready in a minute , ' she said , if you are n't starved to death already . ' Starved ? ' Doctor MacDonald echoed , and laughed with pleasure , looking at her . Starved is the word for it . ' She approached her husband , and stood beside him , her hand resting lightly on his arm . Mr. Munn watched the woman 's face as she looked up at her husband , who held his arm about her shoulders and laughed in his pleasure and confidence . That look , surprised on the face of the woman  --  a woman whom Mr. Munn scarcely knew , whom he had scarcely noticed before , who had always seemed rather plain to him  --  that look stabbed him now , so that abruptly he turned away . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had always thought , when he had noticed her on the streets of Bardsville . Walking down the street there , alone or with one of the sisters , she had never seemed to be the sort of woman people would notice much at all . She and her sisters  --  they all looked alike in their black or gray dresses buttoned up to the throat with that single row of small , severe buttons  --  had moved decorously down the street , with their eyes fixed on the pavementa little ahead of them , or into the distance , and people had said , now and then : There go the Ball girls . Old Professor Ball . ' And they told each other : He 's got some book learning , now I tell you , the Scriptures and in the original tongues , too ; and Shakespeare , you just name it . He knows it by heart . Shakespeare , now , he named all his girls with names out of Shakespeare 's plays . ' Yes , sir , ' Professor Ball had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been at the Ball place , I named them all out of Shakespeare 's plays . Every last one of them  --  Portia , Viola , Cordelia , Perdita , Isabella . Noble names , every last one , names a woman could be proud of . That 's what I told my wife when the first one came ; there 's no nobler nameP320than Portia for any female . She wanted to name her Mary Lee . After her own mother . But I pointed out to her all the advantagesa girl would have with a name like Portia . Something to live up to . A help in forming a Christian character . She said her mother was a Christian character , and I said , I 'm not denying that , she 's as fine a Christian character as has been produced locally in my time , but you ca n't expect imperfect Nature working in one small county to compete with the masterpiecesof the immortal bard . She said she had n't thought of it exactly that way . So we named the infant Portia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , when they came along . Noble names , every last one . The youngest , Isabella , now we almost named her Desdemona , but we decided against it at the last minute . But Desdemona 's a fine name , and many a man 's given his female children worse . But we decided against it . My wife decided me . She was lying there in bed  --  she never really got up after she had the last one , she just lingered until the Lord saw fit . She was lying there in bed , and I took down the book and read her what Shakespeare had written , trying to make up our minds . Then she pointed something out to me , and I bowed to her perspicacity . She said , now does n't the book say that man she ran off and married was colored ? I said , yes , in a way , you might say he was , but he was a gentleman with a fine character , even if he did have an overhasty disposition . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said did I think it was right to give our baby the name of a young woman who had been connected with a man who was colored , even if the man was n't exactly a negro ? I agreed with her . I said we ought to spare even the tenderest sensibility . So we named the baby Isabella . ' When people saw the Ball sisters walking down the street , they said that you could n't tell them apart , unless you looked close . But they were different , Mr. Munn decided , very different ,  |p321des|pite  their deceptive similarities of dress and posture . Portia , the oldest , was already a widow . Her face added to the quietness and gravity of all their faces a sadness , but a sadness disciplined by the will that had marked the firm lines about the mouth ; and this sadness was mixed , at moments when she was unaware of eyes upon her , with a faint , though luminous , expectation . She was the most pious of the sisters . She had occasionallysaid , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her journey all would be consumed in brightness . Meanwhile , she ran the house , directing her sisters in their tasks . She wore a cord of heavy keys at her waistband , the keys of cupboards and pantries and smokehouses . She often sat alone with her father . Viola , who was childless , read a great deal and wrote voluminous letters . Her husband helped on the farm , and she taught the youngest boys in the academy . They were all different  --  Perdita , Isabella , Cordelia . But , to Mr. Munn , Cordelia especially . Sometimes Mr. Munn had wondered how a man like Doctor MacDonald had married a woman like Cordelia . Everything about them seemed different . Ordinarily , you would expect to find Doctor MVlacDonald 's wife a very young , pretty , highspiritedwoman , very dark or very blonde , positive anyway , and with a streak of fun . The way Doctor MacDonald cocked a cigar or stuck a pipe between his teeth , the way he sat a horse , the relish he took in things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things would lead you to expect in his wife something different from Cordelia . She was not very young , thirty , perhaps . She had been getting on toward being an old maid when Doctor MacDonald married her , wrapped up in her household tasks , watching the younger men come to see her sisters Perdita and Isabella , sitting at church with her father and Portia , not with Viola and her husband or with Perdita and Isabella , who would be sitting with a couple of their suitors . And she was quiet and grave , like all the sisters . She was , at first glance cer/tainly , plain , with her dark dresses buttoned up to the neck by that careful and forbidding row of buttons , and her eyes downcast , and her hands folded on her lap . But Doctor MacDonald , whose eyes would wander toward her when she sat apart from him , had married her , and Mr. Munn began , finally , to feel that he understood why . She was precisely the one thing Doctor MacDonald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked except to give some offhand , isolated anecdote , the years in Mississippi , Louisiana , and Mexico  --  had not had , and now had easily , complacently , and casually . Her qualities , her gravity , her earnestness , her restraint , her downcast eyes  --  those were the things best designed to challengehim and , in the end , to engage him . She was somewhat like those small dull , compact apples that in the flush of the harvest are passed over almost with scorn , but late in the winter , when the fine , brightly colored fruit has grown too mealy and insipid , can stir the appetite as though in the darkness of the storage cellar they had managed to keep and augment the ripe , full , wincy richness of the last sunshine of the summer . Doctor MacDonald had married her , and the marriage which had at first seemed to Mr. Munn an incongruity began to seem natural and clear . When Doctor ' MacDonald would talk , his eyes would wander to fix on Cordelia , or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sometimes , though rarely , the coolness of her gravity , her reticences , would fall away , and as she looked at Doctor MacDonald , as that morning on the porch before breakfast , she would , for an instant and in a single glance , be exposed in her secret warmth and fullness and steadfastness . When Mr. Munn detected such a look , he would , as that morning on the porch , feel it as a blow , and would turn away . The impact , the stab , of that look was not the pain of a recollected loss . No , it was pain at something which he had never had . He felt cheated , and impotent , and was filled with envy of the other man , to whom , apparently , it had come so easily.  |p323But  though Mr. Munn would turn away from that transitory look on her face , he had quickly learned to search for it , to spy on her and wait for it . It was rare and fleeting , but he knew that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place when he could get time . The demands on him at his own farm were at their slackest now , and since the house had burned , there was no place for him to sleep there except the gear room , where he had rigged up a cot and an old washstand . Besides , he could no longer put his heart into the work there . It was not the discomfortof the draughty , unceiled gear room and the hard cot , or the sight of the blackened ruins of the brickwork , that distressedhim . The very fields , the slow voices of the negroes talking to him about the plant beds or the stock or the fencing , their silences , reproached him and withdrew from him . When he was there he felt that his life had no direction and his efforts no meaning . He began to think that he might sell the place if he could , if a time came when land would be worth anything again . He thought that he might sell the place , and go away . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to the Ball place now , as he had gone to the Christianplace before . But there was a difference . At the Christian place he had been caught up into a life there ; the small night noises , the distant barking of dogs and the creaking of timbers , the shadowy , white door swinging inward and Lucille Christian standing there , with her finger raised to her lips , her whispered conversation . It had been a restricted , distraught , confused , feverish , and undirected life , but a life which was real , and his own . But at the Ball place , he had no life truly his own ; he watched the life of others move soberly , and sympathetically , about him , and beyond him . But that life at the Christian place was over forever . He knew that . From the moment when he had heard Lucille Christian 's voice on the telephone that morning after the burning of his house , he had known , although he had been unwilling top324acknowledge , that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had gone back to see Lucille Christian . They had sat in the dining-room , with a single lamp burning uncertainly on the big table between them , with their shadows , large and possessiveand black , on the walls behind them , and had eaten in silence . Once or twice , as by accident , their eyes had met , but uncommunicatively and shortly . They had sat there , still withoutspeaking , after the cook had carried out the dishes and the sound of her activities in the pantry and kitchen had ceased . Finally , looking down at the tablecloth and then off at th , shadowy wall beyond her , he had asked her to marry him . When he was free . Oh , Perse , Perse , ' she had cried , why do you have to talk about that ? That is n't important . Now . ' Meeting her eyes fully at last , he had said , It is im-portant . ' No . ' People have to have something to look forward to , ' he had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a distance , at that almost unfamiliar face , something to move toward , to hope for . Some direction . ' She had shaken her head , saying : We ca n't know anything , now . We ca n't do anything . Not anything . ' Then , in the silence , for he had made no reply , still with his eyes fixed on her face across the pool of light , she had said , very quietly and distantly : I do n't feel anything any more . Not anything . ' That night he had slept at the Christian place . He had expectedher to come to him . He had watched the door , waiting for the latch to lift stealthily . But it had not moved . He had stood just inside the door , leaning forward with his brow pressed against the slick , cold surface of the painted wood , filled with his angry and despairing desire . Eventually , standing there , he had become aware of a repeated , almost imperceptible sound , a hoarse , dry susurrus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall to his right . Then , he had identified the sound : it was the sound Mr. Christian made . At the end of the next week Mr. Munn again went out to the Christian place . That night Lucille Christian came to his room . At the door she stood in the accustomed posture , closing it , with her finger lifted as before . And even at that instant , the gesture , now so ironical and superfluous in the new context , told him more positively than her words had been able to tell him how empty she was , and how arbitrary and automatic and meaningless her actions . But denying that knowledge , he felt for a moment that she was as she had been . But it was only for a moment . She lay in his arms shuddering as though from cold . It was as though the half-playful shivering of those times when she had said , chatteringly , Warm my feet , I 'll catch pneumonia all for you , ' had been a kind of parody , fatuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comfort her . He told her that he loved her andwould love her always . Finally , she succumbed to him . Then she told him : I tried  --  I tried , Perse . But it 's no use . ' He said nothing . We ca n't be with each other any more . Not for a long time , anyway . Or never . ' I love you , ' he said . He thought : love . The word rattled in his head like a pea in a dried pod . It 's not you , ' she answered . It 's m e , the way I am . ' I love you . ' We ca n't be with each other , ' she said ; it 's too awful , I ca n't stand it . ' All right , ' he replied . He knew a loathing , suddenly , of himself for the emptiness of the act he had performed : a vicious and shameful pantomime , isolated from all his life before it and from any other life , cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind , fitful meaning of pleasure . He was infected by her emptiness . Or her emptiness had discovered to him his own . SheP326had held it up to him like a mirror , and in her emptiness he had seen , his own . All right , ' he said . The next morning she did not come down to breakfast . He ate scarcely anything , hurried out to the stable and saddled his mare , and rode off . Three days later he received an answer to the letter which he had written to May . But the answer was not from May . It was from Miss Burnham . It ran : Percy Munn : Yours of the 4th inst. received . My niece will not considergiving you a divorce . I do not believe in divorce and neither does my niece and she will not consider giving you one . And I can inform you now that you will not be able to get one yourself , for you have not got any grounds for a divorce because our Heavenly Father knows there was never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint and you drove her from your house like a dog . Also I can tell you too that my niece is going to have a child . I get on my knees every night and pray our HeavenlyFather that this unborn child will never know the kind of creature its father is . I will devote my life to raising this child and nurturing it just as I have devoted my life to raisingmy niece , and I thank our Heavenly Father that it will have in it some of the blood of General Sam Burnham , for you can not make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , as the sayinggoes . And I can tell you Percy Munn that you will never speak to this child , you will never lay eyes on it , if I can prevent , so long as there is a breath in my body . So help me God . Very r'sp'ly yrs , L. BURNHAMMore and more the room at the hotel became intolerable to him . He would go to bed and close his eyes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the floor beneath , seemed to shut him in upon himself , to leave only himself as real , as only the darkness is real when one shuts his eyes . The thought of the other rooms up and down the hall , like this room , and of persons lying within them , sleeping or sleepless and staring , merely validated his own isolation ; and validated the isolation of those other persons . The carpet of the room worn by other feet than his , the stained basin into which other hands had been plunged , the bed that had creaked and sagged beneath other bodies , all of those items , and a dozen more , the cold and rigorous and undifferentiating mirror , defined him as separate from those other persons , as locked within himself . Sometimes he would get out of the bed and go to stand at the window to look down , as he had done that night of the first rally . He would stand at the window and his gaze would follow the progress under the pale street-lamps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the impulse to dress and hurry after that unknown person and walk beside him to his destination . For that person would have a destination . Even though the room had become almost intolerable for him , his practice compelled him to be often in town , and there was no other place for him to stay . He fell into the habit , however , of taking a bottle of whisky up to his room . It helped him to sleep , he thought . But at the Ball place it was different . The steadiness of the life there , although it was not his life , steadied him . If that spied-on and awaited and rare expression in the eyes of Cordeliawhen she looked at her husband stabbed him , or if the calm fulfillment on the face of Portia at the moment after her father 's prayer when she rose to her feet disturbed him with its alien secret , those things , nevertheless , sustained him . And there was Professor Ball , who had read , The Lord is my strength and song ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camped in the little park acrossp328from the railroad station . Day after day Mr. Munn had seen them there . And he had seen them in the evening , on the roads at the edge of town , silently sitting their mounts . They were guarding the town , and people were grateful to them for it . People would go down to watch them parade , or to watch them lounging on the grass in their idle moments . The soldiers hung round the drugstores and poolrooms and saloons , making jokes , swaggering a little . And some of the hangers-on would fawn on them , and make jokes too ; only a few would stare insolentlyat them , not speaking . In the early evening soldiers would walk slowly down the streets with girls beside them . Some of the officers went to dinner in the big brick houses where the warehouse managers and the most successful buyers lived , and Mr. Gay , who owned the Merchants ' Bank , and Mayor Alton and Judge Howe . Or the officers helped to drill the men who formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell into the life there , scarcely altering the pattern . They were guarding the town . They were saving the town . Their sentinels paced up and down at night or sat their mounts by the roadside . At night they paced up and down alongside the blackened areas where the warehouses had been . In the day workmen were busy on those locations clearing away the debris and digging for foundations . There would be new warehouses . On good afternoons men would pause on the pavements oppositethose blackened areas , leaning against the barriers and peering , men wearing overalls , men with lean , red , rawboned , weathered faces and long mustaches . Or a single rider , booted and black-coated , would draw rein there and stare at the piles of brick and rubbish , at the workmen bent over their occupations , and at the soldiers . Then , such a rider would lift his rein and move slowly off . But those other men would lean at the barriers , singly or in groups , and peer . Sometimes one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-doen here ? ' Or ,  |p329Little  sojer-boy , you better git home to yore mammy , er she wo n't have no little sojer-boy . ' Get on off , get on off , ' the guards would say when the watcherscame in past the outer barrier . Get on off , you ca n't stop here . ' Sullenly , the watchers would withdraw . Mr. Munn saw the soldiers at their camp . Sometimes he would pause , when he had occasion to go to the depot , and watch them about their affairs over in the little park . Watching them , he once thought of a time when he had been camping with some boys , a long time back , when he was ten or twelve years old . One of the boys , little Bill Christian , he remembered  --  and thought of that little girl , almost a baby , who would not come clearly to his mind , who now was Lucille Christian , Lucille Christian , who had laid her finger on his lips and said , Hush , hush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that house with the sound of that rasping breath in the next room  --  little Bill Christian had had a tent , and the boys had camped in the tent . Across the park , among their little tents , the soldiers laughed and talked . Or he saw the soldiers on the street , and looked quickly and curiously at their faces , trying to wrench out a secret , as it were , as he had looked at the faces of those people who had come to his office with their troubles , as he had looked at the face of Bunk Trevelyan 's wife that first day . He looked at the faces of the soldiers ; but the faces told him nothing . One day on the street , he met the young lieutenant who had been in charge of the cavalry detail the night his house burned . The lieutenant recognized him , and nodded friendlily . And once Mr. Munn had occasion to go down Front Street , where the warehouses had been . He saw the blackened ruins , the workmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night of the raid , at the moment of the first blast , when the air had reeled , sodden and swollen with sound , he had felt a release , a cer/tainty . That was of that time , not this . Now , in the light of full afternoon , he watched the picks of the workmen rise and fall , and the indifferent guards . The warehouses , ' Doctor MacDonald said , that do n't mean a thing . We want warehouses , do n't we ? Do n't we want somebody to buy our tobacco ? ' Then he grinned . It 's what goes in them counts . And '  --  pausing  --  what gets paid for what goes in them . I do n't see why the warehouses make people downhearted . Or I do see  --  they 're blind as bats . ' I 'm not downhearted , ' Mr. Munn told him , but people are . You can tell . ' All we need is to keep up membership in the Association . And in the other . Give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do , something to think about , nurse ' em along . That 's all we need . Keep that up -- And money , ' Mr. Munn said gloomily . There is n't any more advance money , and we have n't got our price yet , the cornpaniesfeeling so cocky with their soldiers here , and people need money . ' Money , ' Doctor MacDonald replied . Sure . But just enough money to eat . Just that . In a pinch just that , and this is a pinch . A man do n't need much in a pinch . It 'll surprise you , by God . I lived once , six weeks it was , on just a handful of parched corn a day and a jack rabbit or a prairie chicken when I could get one , and me on the move , too . Moving fast , ' he added as though by way of parenthesis , and grinned confidentially . That was down in Mexico . ' It 'll take more'n parched corn , ' Mr. Munn declared , and people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody start to crack down on mortgagesand throw people off their places . God-a-mighty , when the Professor gets me down on my knee-caps these days all I ask the Lord for is to let those bastards start foreclosing mortgages . ' He stabbed the air with the stem of his unlit pipe , andP331his eyes narrowed . God-a-mighty , just let them start foreclosing , that 's all we need . That 'll heat people up . ' They cracked down on Senator Tolliver , ' Mr. Munn observed . He was living in the office there on his place , and they 've evicted him . He 's still got some influence , I reckon , and if they 'd evict him , they 'd evict anybody . ' They used him , and they 're through . He 's a second-hand corncob now , I tell you . And nobody gives a damn . Do you ? ' Do I give a damn ? ' Mr. Munn echoed . Then he answered , No , I do n't . ' You used to be pretty thick with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who do you think does ? ' I do n't , ' Mr. Munn answered shortly . He remembered the Senator standing there on the baggage truck at the depot , afraid of the crowd , cringing before it , suspicious of it and desperate , and his face sallow and sunken in the afternoon light . And nobody does , I reckon , ' he added . Well , for one , I do n't , God knows . And nobody does . That 's why they cracked down on him . But if they turned out some God-forsaken little bastard with forty acres and that not good for sassafras , you 'd give a damn , and plenty of people would . If they started that . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said slowly . But they 're too smart , ' Doctor MacDonald went on . They wo n't do it , because they 're too smart . Not now . But just let the Association crack , and wo n't anybody be a thing but hired hands for the Merchants ' Bank and the Alta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Association together . The companiesca n't last forever without tobacco . They ca n't keep those soldiers here forever . If they build warehouses , they 've got to put something in them . ' We do n't control near half the crop , ' Mr. Munn objected . Well , tobacco comes out of plant beds , ' Doctor MacDonald retorted , do n't it ? '  |p332Mr  . Murin looked at him . We did it before , ' he said . I reckon we can do it again . ' I reckon we can , ' Doctor MacDonald agreed , and grinning , his lips curled back from the long teeth . Doctor MacDonald was like that . He would give that easy , soft laugh , like a man looking out on things from the confidence of his own inner , secret world . Because he was confident and easy in that inner world , he was easy and confident at whatever he set his hand to in the outer world . He would lift his arm in a slow , half-lazy motion to knock out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , and you could see , below the tooshortsleeve of his coat , the tendons slip slickly and strongly , like a piston in oil , beneath the brown skin of his wrist , the slowness , somehow , suggesting the potentiality of speed . Or he would swing himself lankily to his saddle , and turning to speak , would gather the reins as in idleness ; but the restive horse would become still as a post . A handful of parched corn , he had said . That was what he had had , down in Mexico , and moving fast . But it had not been the handful of parched corn that sustained him , Mr. Munn somehow felt ; not that , for he had been sustained by something else , a nourishment within himself . Doctor MacDonald was right , Mr. Munn admitted to himself . With luck it could be done , it was possible . If people were like Doctor MacDonald . He wondered how much he himself was like Doctor MacDonald . He , he himself , could take a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Association , that was what was left . If they could win . If they did n't win . He did not think beyond that except to think what could there be , for him , beyond that . The Association , that was what he was now , if he was anything . He thought : if I am anything . But Doctor MacDonald  --  let the Association go to pot , let everything , and Doctor MacDonald would still be himself . You could guess that.  |p333Doctor  MacDonald did not change . At the meetings with the captains and commanders , or meetings held for a few bands of the men , meetings held in empty barns or in farmhouses with the windows shuttered and a single lamp turned down low and the men half-listening for a warning from the watchmen down the road and in the woods , Doctor MacDonald could still lean toward them , casually , as he had at first , and talk easily and confidentially . The way he must talk to a woman whose husband was sick , or whose child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually relax , and listen to him , and when they spoke their own voices would sound natural again and their postures would lose that impression of a crouching , anticipatory strain . Even after the night when the troops tried to raid a meeting , and would have succeeded except for the watchmen , DoctorMacDonald did not change . Some of the people , Mr. Sills and Mr. Burden , urged him not to have another meeting after that , not until things quieted down . No , ' Doctor MacDonald said , now 's the time , ' in the voice of a man saying it 's time for dinner , or time to lock up for the night . At the next meeting , he knocked out his pipe , and observed : Well , gentlemen , they almostbagged us . And I reckon we all know why . ' Halfamusedly , he looked about him , from face to face . Then he added , as though in afterthought : Somebody let it slip . Somebodyjust let it slip . All we 've got to do ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , almost furtively  --  is to find out who it was . Because , ' he said gently , he might just let it slip again . ' And he grinned , and stuck his hands into his pockets . Only once did Mr. Munn see a change in him . It was on a gusty Sunday morning . A man who lived down the pike from the Ball place rode up to the gate , dismounted , and approached the house . Doctor MacDonald , watching him walk up the rise toward the house , said idly , There comes Parsons ; wonder what he wants . ' Parsons had come to deliver a message . Mr. Sills had been trying to get the Ball place on the telephone , he said ,  |p334but  the line was down . Coming up , he had seen an old gum tree fallen across the line down the pike a piece . It was so rotten it was ready to come down if you looked hard at it , anyway . But Mr. Sills thought Doctor MacDonald ought to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over near Bardsville the night before and whipped him with a whip . The men had beat on the door and told Mr. Elkins to come out or they would put dynamite under the house , and he had come on out because he was afraid for his wife and family . They whipped him , then they got the wife and children out and dynamited the house anyway . They just hurt one wing of the house , though , Mr. Parsonssaid . Nobody knew exactly why they did it . It do n't matter why , ' Doctor MacDonald interrupted , and rose from his chair and strode to the hearth . One of them said it was because Mr. Elkins did n't fire his nigger tenants , ' Mr. Parsons said , and then again some of them said it was because he was n't in the Association . But they was all drinking hard , it looks like , saying one thing and another . ' It do n't matter why , ' Doctor MacDonald declared . His long face was pale with the fury that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , if I just knew who ! ' Mr. Elkins was an anti-Association man , ' Mr. Parsons observed , as though in placation . Doctor MacDonald wheeled at him . I do n't care if he was president of the Alta Company ; I do n't care if he 's anti or not . They did it without authority . If they 're Association people did it , they did it without authority . If they 're not Association --  He paused , his hands clenching and unclenching about the pipe he held . They 're not Association , ' Professor Ball said ; they 're not our people . ' The stem of the pipe in Doctor MacDonald 's hands snapped . He flung the thing into the fire , turned on his heel , and went out the door without a word.  |p335Our  people , Mr. Munn thought . Then asked , Our people , who are they ? ' It was that fellow Lew Smullin phoning saved me , ' Doctor MacDonald said . But by the barest . Yes , sir , there was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nearer dark than you might expect for the time it was  --  it 'd been raining off and on all day and still overcast , and promising to drizzle  --  and that was luck , too , I reckon . I 'd just got in from making my rounds and was getting dried out in front of the fire , when the telephone rang and Viola answered it and said it was for me . It was that fellow Smullin . He just said , right fast and near a whisper , This is Smullin , Smullin , over at the courthouse , they got a warrant out for you and they 're coming , with soldiers ; they been gone quite a spell . Then he hung up , quick , before I really caught on what he was saying . By that time Portia and my wife 'd come in , and I told them not to get excited , but the soldiers were coming to arrest me , and I was going to get my horse and get out the back way by the old road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hand it to those girls now ; they did n't do any cutting-up . They did n't say a word . Cordelia went sort of white , and took hold of the back of a chair with one hand . Then she said , All right , I 'll go down to the stable with you while you saddle up . But Portia said no , that was n't the thing to do . That they 'd be watching the back , if they had any sense . And I said , well , the Lord knows they 'll be watching the front if they 're here , and I 'd take my chances . She did n't answer me , something round the house  --  Portia , she 's boss in the house here  --  she said , Viola , get me the bandage box . Viola let her jaw drop and looked at Portia for a second , and I guess my jaw dropped some too at her asking for the bandage box . But Portia said , Viola , this is no time to delay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to the stable , quick , and saddle up papa 's horse . I said no , I 'd saddle up and I did n't want the Professor 's horse , I wanted my own . You know that old gray horse the Professor rides round is so fat it ca n't go better'n a walk . But she grabbed my arm , and said to Cordelia , go on , do it . And said to me , pull off your coat , quick . Look here , I said to her , who 's this warrant for , you or me ? I 'm going to get my horse . Then she said , Take off your coat , Hugh , so we can bandage up your hands . I burst right out laughing . For a fact . Then they just bandaged me up , like the Professor . And they got one of the Professor 's old long , black coats and I put it on  --  both of us being tall and spare-made  --  and one of his old black hats that flop down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordelia had his old gray horse saddled up . Soon as I got on , Portia said , Turn your coat collar up , and hang your head down like papa when he 's riding along thinking , and they ca n't see you have n't got a beard . Well , I met them down the road a piece . Not a long piece , either . About a half-dozen of soldiers , and two or three deputies , I reckon . I just lifted up my hand the way the Professor does when he meets somebody on the road , and prayed the Old Marster 'd make those bastards notice the bandages and all . Well , they did . One of the deputies said , Good evening , ProfessorBall , and I rode on with my chin dug down in my breastboneso hard it hurt , just like I was the Professor busy thinking . I went on over to the Campbell place and spent the night . They almost busted a hame laughing when they got a good look at me , too . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't got out that old back road if I 'd tried . There was soldiers out there , too . Those soldiers I met on the road was n't but half of them , the others coming round on the old road and scattering out back . They 'd a-picked me up , sure . You 'll have to hand it to Portia , now . She 's a smart one . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said , a smart one . '  |p337But  I reckon it 's going to be laying low a spell for me , ' DoctorMacDonald said , like I been doing for more'n ten days now . I been spelling round in different people 's houses , the Campbells and Donelsons and Nelsons most , but not a night or two at a place in succession .  --  Night , did I say night ? I been doing most of my sleeping in the daytime , and up half the night tendingto my patients . Looks like it comes a spell of wet weather and the roads mire up or a fellow gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everybody in the damned county goes and gets down sick and wants you to doctor them . Cordelia or some of them gets the calls at the house and they pass them on to meThey 'll hook you , ' Mr. Munn said fatalistically , if you are n't careful . They 'll hook you on a fake call . ' Play sick to hook me , ' Doctor MacDonald retorted , and I 'll make somebody sick . I 'll take him apart unless God-a-mighty 's got a new way patented for putting a man 's parts together . I 'll take him apart like a clock . ' He seemed pleased with himself , smiling . Then , soberly , he added : What I ca n't figure is why they up all at once and try to get me . They been round here quite a spell now , and they just suddenly up and try to get me . ' I ' 11 tell you , ' Mr. Munn said . They figure they got some evidence now that 'll stand up in a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's it . They think their evidence 'll stand up . ' They got next to somebody . ' Sure , ' Mr. Munn agreed . Somebody . ' They never would 've known to lay for the boys at Fulton 's plant bed if they had n't got next to somebody . And get Turpin and Mosely . ' He shrugged . Anyway , I 'm glad it 's Turpin and Mosely sitting over there in the jail-house , and not me . ' They wo n't give them bail , ' Mr. Munn said . Well , you can be durned sure , then , they would n't give me bail if they got me . But they wo n't get me . I do n't like to be indoorsso much . Just let me sit round the house a couple of daysp338and I need calomel , damned if I do n't . I 'll just stay outer their way till they get tired and call off the dogs . ' If they 've got evidence , they wo n't get tired soon . ' Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as folks 'll put up with all the visiting round I been doing lately . ' They wo n't get tired , ' Mr. Munn replied slowly , unless ' Unless what ? ' Unless the Association 'll play ball . Make a deal . ' Which it wo n't do , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Unless , ' Mr. Munn remarked quietly , they catch you . Then they 'll try to force a deal by putting the pressure on you . On whoever else they can get . Me , for instance . ' They wo n't catch me , ' Doctor MacDonald announced . It ai n't in them . ' He lay back at ease , propped on his elbow on the bed , and the smoke curled comfortably up from his pipe . His boots , damp and stained with half dried mud , stood by the bed . He wriggled his toes in his heavy wool socks , and complacentlystudied their motion . Another thing I ca n't figure , ' he said , is Smull in calling me up and telling me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in my life . Never said more'n howdy-do then . ' I 've seen him a lot , being round the courthouse the way I am , ' Mr. Munn said , but I ca n't say I know him , exactly . Nobody does . He never says a thing . Just hangs round a bunch of men , on the edge ; one of those fellows  --  you know the kind  --  they hang round on the edge and never say a thing . ' He 's sure a God-forsaken , broken-down-looking old bastard . ' He 's that , ' Mr. Munn agreed . Well , I ca n't figure out him calling up . You 'd figure him sucking along with the gang at the courthouse . And all they want is to keep on warming chairs with their fat asses . ' Maybe , ' Mr. Munn said meditatively  --  maybe he just did n't want to see you get caught . '  |p339Hell  , ' Doctor MacDonald exclaimed , he ai n't a farmer , what does he care ? ' Maybe he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damned fool . ' Damned fool is right . ' Doctor MacDonald laughed . He flexed his long legs , rumpling the patchwork quilt on which he lay . I reckon he was taking a chance on his job , calling me . ' Yes , ' Mr. Munn said , he was . ' Yes , he thought . All those years dragging his club foot round town , trying to sell a little life insurance or hail insurance or fire insurance to people . Hanging round groups of men at the post office or the depot or on the street corner , trying to get up nerve to say to somebody , I wonder if you 'd be interested in some insurance , now I was just wondering And then stopping , waiting for the man toanswer , No . ' And going home at night to the little house at the edge of town . Nobody else had been in that house , not for years , not since his old mother , Mrs. Smullin , died , people said . Going home , and lighting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something off the kitchen table . Something he 'd bought and taken home in a paper sack . All that before getting the job , God knew how , at the courthouse . Now he could sit round there in the afternoons and evenings , listening to the men talk . He did n't have to try to work himself up to say , Iwonder if you 'd be interested , I was just wondering -- He could just hang round and listen , and not worry . Except for being a damned fool , and making that telephone call . He came mighty near waiting too long ; another five minutes and they 'd have had me , ' Doctor MacDonald was saying . Yes , ' Mr. Munn rejoined . A miss is as good as a mile , though , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Yes . ' I hope he do n't lose his job , ' Doctor MacDonald remarked . Then : He sure did n't stand to gain anything . The poor old fool . '  |p340Mr  . Munn studied him . There 're a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly , for instance . You 're a fool . What did you stand to gain ? All you stood to gain was to have to hide out to keep from jail . ' Or the rope , ' Doctor MacDonald answered , if the bastards can play it their way . ' We 're all damned fools . A lot of us , anyway . ' People are damned fools in different ways . They got differentstuff in them . ' You ca n't figure out Smullin , ' Mr. Munn told him . Well , I ca n't figure you out . ' Neither can I , ' Doctor MacDonald returned amiably . Been trying for years . But I ca n't do it . ' He leaned back comfortably , shoving the pillow . I ca n't figure myself out , ' Mr. Munn said , sometimes . ' Doctor MacDonald let the smoke drift easily from his nostrils . He glanced up at the low ceiling , as though in reflection ; then about the room , letting his eyes rest upon the steady flame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon Mr. Munn 's face . I reckon a man goes his gait , ' he said , and yawned . They said nothing for a time . Then Doctor MacDonald swung his legs off the bed and rose . He said that he had to go out and see one of his patients , and that he 'd be back some before day . Sitting on the edge of the bed , he pulled on his boots . Then he went across to the dresser and peered at himself in the mirror . He ran a comb through his bushy hair , yawned once , and stretched his arms above his head , almost touching the low ceiling , filling the room , making his shadow on the wall behind him look like a big , awkward bird . Then he said , So long , ' and went out the door . Mr. Munn slept there at the Campbells ' . He scarcely woke up when Doctor MacDonald came in . In the morning , Mr. Munn dressed as quietly as possible in order not to wake him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , snoring gently ,  |p341with  his long , bony head thrust into the pillow and one big hand grasping the bedpost , as though sleep itself were not a passivity , but was at its secret core , when all the accidents of softness and ease had been stripped away , an act of will and tension . Mr. Munn managed to get out without waking him . He did not see him again until the night the troops came again to the Ball place for him . They tried to circle the house and to close in , slowly , on foot ; but the dogs scented them . The dogs barked wildly and throatily , rushing away from the house , filling the woods to the west of the house with a distant , hollow clamor , vibrant as in a cave . It do n't sound very encouraging , ' Doctor MacDonald remarked . He leaned forward in his chair , drawing his legs under him , easily but as though in readiness to rise . Mr. Munn said nothing . He was listening to the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durn it , ' Doctor MacDonald exclaimed , almost peevishly , ca n't they leave a man alone ? And this the second night I been home in three weeks . ' The door to the next room swung softly open . Cordelia stood there . Her hand was on the knob , and she did not move . She said nothing . Behind her , seated around a lamp , were the others , with their heads lifted to listen . Maybe it 's not that , ' Mr. Munn suggested . But the barking was closer , and circling . Durn , ' Doctor MacDonald said , and stood upright from the chair in a sudden motion . The dogs were retreating toward the house . Their barking was furious , deep-throated , incessant . Professor Ball stood behind Cordelia at the door . Come here , ' Doctor MacDonald commanded , and Cordelia came to him . She laid her hand on his arm . Do n't get excited , ' he told her.  |p342The  others crowded into the room . Do those kids know I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , they do n't know . ' The dogs were near now . If it is anything , I ca n't get out now , ' Doctor MacDonald asserted . They 're all round . ' The others looked at each other , not speaking ; except Cordelia , whose eyes were on Doctor MacDonald 's face . I 'll try the loft , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Professor Ball moved toward the hall door , Portia by his side . No , ' Doctor MacDonald ordered . Sit down . Go sit down like you were . ' They stood and looked at him . Like you were , ' he said sharply . Be talking , or something . I 'll get in the loft and pull the ladder up after me . ' Almost casually , he removed Cordelia 's hand from his sleeve , then turned and was at the hall door in three abrupt , plunging strides . They heard his feet heavy on the bare boards of the stairs . Where 's Isabella ? ' Portia suddenly demanded . No one answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall door . I 'll get her , ' she said . Sit down , ' Professor Ball directed . It 's too late . Sit down , like he said . ' He laid an arm around Cordelia 's shoulders , then withdrew it . Go sit down , ' he repeated , in yonder . ' He raised his right hand and , clumsily because of the knobby bandages , plucked at his beard . On the porch , one of the dogs barked frenziedly . There was a pounding at the door . The women had gone into the next room . Sit down , ' Professor Ball ordered Mr. Munn , and moved toward the hall , slowly . Mr. Munn let himself down , almost warily , into his chair . He heard the voices in the hall , Professor Ball saying : Good evening . What can I do for you ? ' and another voice : We 've come for Doctor MacDonald . Where is he ? '  |p343He  heard Professor Ball 's voice answer : Come in , gentlemen , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That wo n't do any good , ' the other voice answered . We had word . He 's here . ' He 's not here , ' Professor Ball 's voice repeated . By an effort of will , painfully , Mr. Munn conquered his impulse to rise from the chair . He ca n't get out , ' the voice said . There 's men all round . ' The door from the hall swung fully open and a man in uniform stood there . Other men were behind him . Looking at the man , Mr. Munn thought : I can stand up now , I can stand up , it 's the natural thing to do now . He stood up and looked at the man . All right , ' the man at the door said back over his shoulder , to Professor Ball , we 'll search the house . If you want it that way , you can have it . ' He stepped into the room . Who are you ? ' he demanded of Mr. Munn . My name 's Munn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural and even . What are you doing here ? ' Do you have a warrant for me ? ' No , ' the man replied . All right , then , it 's none of your concern . ' Well , we will have ' fore long '  --  a chunky man with a pockmarkedface stepped up even with the officer , and nodded toward Mr. Munn . You 're Percy Munn , I know you . You 're one of ' em , too . They 'll be gitten a warrant for you , all right . ' I reckon you 're a deputy , ' Mr. Munn said , and looked at the man . Yeah , ' the man admitted . Well , ' Mr. Munn declared judicially , I 'm glad to see the deputies they got over here in Hunter County are as big sonsof-bitchesas the deputies we got over at Bardsville. '  |p344I  ' 11 ' The chunky man raised his clenched fist , as though for a blow , and took a step toward Mr. Munn . You better be trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chunky man lowered his fist . What 's in there ? ' he demanded , and nodded toward the closed door across the room . Mr. Munn did not answer . My daughters are in there , ' Professor Ball , standing at the hall door , told him . Well , I reckon they ai n't turned in yet , ' the deputy said , and crossed to jerk open the door . The women there , faces raised as though in surprise , were sitting about the lamp , their sewing on their knees . I suppose , ' Mr. Munn remarked to the officer , they have to pay you good money to make you get caught out with that '  --  and with a nod he indicated the chunky man . Or , ' Mr. Munn added , do you like it ? ' The officer opened his lips as though to speak . Then , after an instant , he asked , What 's out that way ? ' And he pointed beyond the room where the women still sat , with their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where some boys sleep . Pupils of mine , ' he added . The chunky man looked back over his shoulder . Yeah , yeah , ' he said , almost jeeringly , he 's a schoolteacher . ' Why do n't you start there ? ' the officer demanded . Then to the soldiers in the hall : Allen , Forbes , go with him . ' Two of the soldiers entered the room , lifting their feet in a cautious tread as though on treacherous ice , or as though afraid of smearing the floor with the red mud that was thick on their shoes . One of them , as he passed , glanced apologetically at Mr. Munn . The officer stood in the middle of the room , waiting . Nop345one spoke . The dogs on the front porch were now barking intermittently . The deputy and the soldiers came back . Then they searched the back of the house and the rooms across the hall . All the while the officer , saying nothing , stood there with Professor Ball and Mr. Munn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , ' the officer said . Let 's look upstairs . ' He went toward the hall , saying to Professor Ball , You better come , too . ' Then to one of the soldiers , You keep an eye on him . ' With a jerk of his thumb , he indicated Mr. Munn . The women had entered from the next room . They stood grouped closely together , and looked , as from a painful inquiring distance , at the men . Just a minute , ' Mr. Munn said abruptly . The officer turned , and looked at him . Maybe , Mr. Munn thought , maybe . He was conscious of the eyes of the women upon him . He could not see them , but he was aware of them looking , leaning . He thought , If I make a row , maybe they wo n't go up , maybe they 'll just take me and go , and they ca n't do anything to me , not to me , they have n't got anything on me . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munn it seemed as though he had just rediscovered the officer standing there , as though he himself had been lost in some great lag of time , and now , suddenly , had risen again into time , like a diver bursting to the surface . Nothing , ' Mr. Munn answered . The officer went out , and there was a tramping of feet on the stairs . No , Mr. Munn thought , it would n't have worked , it would n't have done any good . He did not look at the women . The feet moved overhead , scrapingly on the bare floors . He heard the sound of doors being opened , then closed . He wondered if hep346had n't made the row with the officer because he was afraid . A coward . Then he thought , No , it would n't have done any good . He heard the voices upstairs , suddenly sharp and demanding . Someone was pounding on a door . It was the officer 's voice that was commanding , very loud , Open that door ! ' Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way . It 's Isabella , ' Portia said . It 's Isabella ; she wo n't let them in . ' Get away , ' Mr. Munn ordered the soldier , who held his carbine at the port to block the door . He laid his hand on the carbine . The soldier 's face , he noticed flickeringly , irrelevantly , was round and unformed , childish . Listen , boy , ' Mr. Munn said , speaking quickly , lay a hand on me and get in trouble . Real trouble . They have n't got a warrant for me . It 'll be trouble for you . Listen , I 'm a lawyer , I know . ' Mr. Munn did not take his hand from the carbine . The boy gave a little ground . Get away , ' Mr. Munn said . All he said was keep an eye on me . Get away . ' He pushed past the soldier and ran up the steps , the soldier following . The officer stood in front of the locked door of the bedroom at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and the two soldiers on the other . One of the soldiers held a lamp , the chimney smutted now because the flame had flared and jerked with the motion of being carried about . The light was wavering and uncertain . Professor Ball stood behind the soldiers . Mr. Munn stood beside the soldier with the lamp . Open that door , ' the officer ordered , loud . Even in the unsure light Mr. Munn could see that his face was flushing with irritation . As he spoke he truculently thrust his head forward.  |p347No  , ' the voice from beyond the door said faintly , you ca n't come in . Not in my room . You have n't any right . ' The deputy grinned . Nodding confidentially at the soldier who had come up with Mr. Munn , he remarked : She said no man was n't come-en her room , did n't have the right . I just reckon you ai n't the right man , lieutenant . ' The soldier with the lamp grinned too . Oh , she 's a lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , ' the officer commanded . Then , turning to the door : Miss , you oughter let us in . It 's the law . We wo n't bother you . Not a bit . ' His voice was wheedling , cajoling , now . We 'll catch him sooner or later . If he 's hiding in there , you wo n't do him any good acting this way Covertly , Mr. Munn glanced down the hall . It was shadowy there , almost dark , but the loft ladder , it was not there . Doctor MacDonald was in the loft . He had taken the ladder up . He was not in the room there , with the girl.  --  not a bit of good , Miss . Now , Miss , open up , please . ' No , ' the girl 's voice replied . All right , all right . ' The officer 's voice was loud again , and harsh . All right , Miss , we 're gon na knock the door down . ' I told you I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe it , ' the officer answered . We 're gon na knock it down . ' She 's got a gun all right , ' Mr. Munn said . How do you know ? ' There was a gun sitting in the corner . I saw it . Right there '  --  and Mr. Munn pointed toward the corner beyond the door . It 's gone now . ' Listen , ' Professor Ball told the officer , she might shoot somebody . And you 'd be responsible . She might do it . She 's the youngest , and headstrong and spoiled , spoiled when she was a child , being the youngest -- Hell , ' the deputy exclaimed , she ai n't got no gun . She'sp348bluffen . They 're all bluffen . ' But he sidled away from the door a little . Bluffing , Mr. Munn thought . She had the gun , all right . But Doctor MacDonald was n't in there with her , he was sure of that . Bluffing , yes , she was bluffing . She was trying to bluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't thinking beyond that , she was just doing that . What she could . With his fist , the officer struck the heavy panel of the door . No gentleman , ' Professor Ball complained querulously  --  no gentleman would go and make a young girl like her shoot somebody . ' Listen , ' the officer said , addressing the door , we do n't think you 've got a gun . You 're bluffing . We 're coming in . ' There was no answer . Then with a small , grating sound , the door swung inward about eight inches . Mr. Munn peered at the aperture . I have , you can see it  --  but do n't come close . ' Her voice was broken , as though she was crying , or trying to keep from crying . It was there . Mr. Munn could see in the shadow , not protrudingfrom the room , the muzzle of the shotgun like a small figure eight laid on its side . It was wavering there in the shadow . Now , Miss , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just pass it out to me , we are n't gon na bother you . ' He did not reach out for the gun , his arms hanging loosely at his sides . Come on , Miss , you do n't want to make trouble ; come on -- The soldier standing closest to the wall , out of range of vision from the interior , leaned slowly toward the door jamb . The officer drew his feet closer together , the knees flexing a little . Come on , lady , come on , now , ' he kept saying coaxingly . Mr. Munn saw the soldier lean toward the door jamb . He saw his hand stealthily rise . Isabella ! ' he shouted warningly , watch ' But the soldier behind him chunked him heavily inthe ribs with the carbine butt so that he fell to one knee , gasping . And at the instant he fell , the hand reached round the door/jamb and swept down to seize the barrel of the shotgun , and the officer plunged sideways , and the roar of the gun filled the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door shouted . The shotgun dangled loosely from his grasp . Downstairs , one of the women screamed . The officer stepped into the room , his pistol drawn . The soldier with the lamp followed , then the deputy . Mr. Munn rose slowly to his feet . There , before him on the floor , was the mark where the charge of shot had buried itself in the oak planking . The women , calling , were coming up the stairs . The girl was sitting on the floor , her head pressed against the door jamb and her shoulders shaking with sobs . Professor Ball , on his knees beside her , the skirts of his long black coat almost brushing the floor , as when he knelt to pray , was moving his clumsy bandaged hand over her hair with a mechanical gesture of comfort . He was mumbling something , Mr. Munn could not make out what . Mr. Munn turned to meet the interrogation and distress on the faces of the women . It 's all right , ' he said . As Portia moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier with the lamp behind him . He looked down at the huddled girl . Professor Ball rose , his tall , thin figure weaving crankily . He put out his hand to the wall to brace himself . You did n't have to do that , ' he told the officer , his voice croaking and distant . The officer did not seem to hear him . Miss , ' he said , addressingthe girl on the floor , Miss , I sure ' The soldier who still held the shotgun set it against the wall , almost surreptitiously . Miss , ' the officer repeated , then stopped . There was a slight scraping noise down the hall . Mr. Munn turned in time to see , indistinct in the shadow , the long form of Doctor MacDonald hang for an instant from the edge of the loft door before he dropped to the floor . P350THE trees were getting on toward leaf , now . But you could still see through their branches , across the square to the courthouse , and beyond . When they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the massy depth of the green , you could only see the roof of the courthouse and the squat , square brick tower with the clock . That happened all at once . For a while after the buds began you could see the individual boughs hung with that uncertain , irregular green that in the fading light , as now , seemed gray , or seemed , on the very highest boughs where the last ray of sun struck , a pale gold . For a while , day after day , there would be the boughs , visible and individual , and through them you could see the courthouse , the benches under the trees , and the buildings on the other side of the square ; then suddenly , one morning , you could see nothing , or for the first time you realized that you could see nothing , and you were surprised as though it had all happened , at one stroke , that night . The season had turned . Mr. Munn kept on looking out of the window of his office at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , you thought , and then , even as you looked , were not . There was , for instance , that small pain in the side , a stitch , nothing more , something so familiar that you scarcely noticed it , part of the unvarying , permeating medium in which your being was supported ; then it was that no longer , it was cancer , it was death . Death grew in you like the leaves on the trees in spring , gentle and tender and unobtrusive , and then , in the moment of knowledge , was already luxuriant , full-blown , blottingout the familiar objects . If not the small pain in the side ,  |p351some  word you spoke , some careless gesture , some momentary concession to vanity , some burst of pity , or some trivial decision  --  that was the bud , the leaf swelling toward recognition . He shrugged his shoulders , and rose from his chair . Doctor MacDonald had said , Well , a man goes his own gait . ' And that was true . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting dim . His eyes rested upon the familiar objects : the tall walnut bookcases with the glass in the doors cracked , the stacks of books and papers , dust-covered , in chairs against the wall , the other chair , the chair where Mrs. Trevelyan had sat that day , the filing cabinets , the pictures , the rifle and the shotgun propped in a corner with old envelopes drawn over the muzzles to save them from dust . He had brought the shotgun back from the Christian place , he remembered , after his last bird hunt with Mr. Christian . They had had a good afternoon , that last afternoon , no wind , the sky clear and distant with a tinge of frosty gray , like iron , on the northern horizon as the sun got low , the dogs working in the tawny sagegrass beyond a cedar grove . He had brought the gun back here the next morning , had set it in the corner , and had put the envelope over the muzzle . How long ago that seemed ! But he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not touched it except to oil it , not since the time he went down to Reelfoot Lake deer-hunting . He had not killed a deer with the rifle that trip . The only deer he had killed had been brought down with a charge of buckshot at less than fifteen paces . He had been leaning against an oak near the run , and the deer had appeared , momentarily motionless , with lifted head , an easy shot . At night the men had sat in a cabin around a stove , their belts loosened and a whisky bottle on the table , warm with the fire and the food and the drink and in the surety of comradeship . But now he could not even remember the name of one of the men . That , too , was a long time back.  |p352The  things you remembered , they were what you were . But every time you remembered them you were different . For a long time you would not notice any difference , as you noticed no difference in the spring when , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the boughs , or in the fall slowly dropped away ; until the time came when , all at once , there was the difference . Every object in the room , in its familiarity , proclaimed a difference , the shotgun there in the corner , the books he had read , the dusty papers filled with his writing . He had written on those pages for some purpose ; the purpose was gone now , but there the writing still was , yellowing out , going too , but outliving the purpose that had guided the pen across the sheets . Over the sights of the shotgun , in the flicker of an instant , he had seen the last quail rise in the whirr of wings against the lemon-colored sky , and his finger had pressed the trigger , and the bird had stumbled , as it were , on the air and plunged downward like a stone . There the shotgun was , as it had been ; but the unnamable impulse that had made him lift it and press the trigger that afternoon was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreversible in their consequencesand not to be undone , but the impulse , the desire , the purpose , had gone . It was hard sometimes to guess what they had been . He stopped moving about the office . To hell with it , he thought . That did n't matter . The only thing that mattered was to see MacDonald out , now . There was , at least , that . That was the only thing that mattered , now , for it was the only thing left to matter . Five days earlier the board of the Association had voted to sell . Mr. Sills and Mr. Munn had stood out against it . But it had been no use . Some had been hopeless , some had needed cash too desperately , some had been afraid . Looking about the table , Mr. Munn had wondered how many had the threat of an indictment hanging over their heads to force the vote.  |p353That  's what the evidence was being used for , to squeeze . And after that it might be used for something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come for him : on the street in broad daylight , some night at the hotel ? Mr. Sills had stood by him , but it had been no use . After the vote , Mr. Munn had gone down the stairs by himself , ahead of the others . It was over . The other men had n't been willing to look at each other . They had known it was over . Mr. Munn had walked down the street and across the courthouse square to the jail . They had let him into the cell . He had not known how , exactly , to say it to Doctor MacDonald . Durn it , ' Doctor MacDonald exclaimed , just like I said , sitting round so much makes me bilious . It 's not natural to a man to be sitting round . And this time of year your blood needs thinning like as not , anyway . I 'm sure glad they 'll be starting the trial in a few days . ' Mr. Munn said nothing . Of course , ' Doctor MacDonald added , almost cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spell afterward . Bilious or not . ' You ought never given yourself up , ' Mr. Munn said bitterly , not looking at him . You ought never come down that night . It was n't necessary . They would have gone away . After what happened . ' Hell , Perse , you keep saying that . How did I know what was happening downstairs , hearing that shooting and all ? Anything might have been going on , and me in the attic , not know-ing . ' You ought never come down , ' Mr. Munn repeated . Well , I did , ' Doctor MacDonald said , and here I am . Only hope I do n't stay here too long . ' Listen , ' Mr. Munn commanded , leaning toward him , looking at him now , I do n't know what evidence they got , but I bet they do n't nail you . Wilkins is a good man , a damned goodp354lawyer ; he 's no fool ; he 'll see to it that fury 's not all one way ' Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ' Doctor MacDonald said . But I still wish you 'd taken the case . Like I asked . ' And have your lawyer get arrested in the middle of it ? They may get me any day . Any day they think they 've got evidence that 'll stick . Wilkins , he 'll manage . ' Maybe , ' Doctor MacDonald agreed , in a tone of friendly concession . Listen , ' Mr. Munn reiterated , leaning , let them nail you , and there 's men will take this place apart . Plenty of them . Soldiers or no soldiers . No '  --  and he shook his head  --  they wo n't nail you . They 'll be afraid . ' Maybe , ' Doctor MacDonald repeated cheerfully . He moved the length of the cell , three paces , short paces for him , and lifted his arms , slowly , almost luxuriously , above his head . Mr. Munn sat clown on the edge of the cot . He felt done in . He felt like a man who , new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds , suddenly , his knees water and his head giddy with the empty air . Bilious , ' Doctor MacDonald declared ; that 's what it does to me . My teeth feel green . Like moss on a rotten shingle . Damned if they do n't . ' Mr. Munn did not answer , looking down at the stained concreteof the floor . He had the impulse to lie back on the cot , to let himself go . If they got him , arrested him and brought him here , he could just lie back and shut his eyes . Then there would n't be any reason not to . He could do it . Well ? ' Doctor MacDonald was saying inquiringly . He was standing in the middle of the cell , staring down at him . Doctor MacDonald stood there , in his shirt-sleeves and with his vest unbuttoned , tall even in his carpet slippers , the light from the window falling directly on his unkempt , strong-bonedP355head . He stood with his weight off his heels , like a boxer , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt he wore were fresh and stiff . Mr. Munn looked at them . Cordelia brought him a clean shirt every morning , he knew . She wrapped the shirt up in a piece of paper , every morning , and left the hotel , and walked down the street , not looking at anybody , and crossed the square and came here . She would stand in the cell and hold one of Doctor MacDonald 's hands with both of hers . Well , ' Doctor MacDonald demanded , what 's the matter with you ? ' Mr. Munn leaned back until his shoulders came into contact with the stone of the wall . The board , ' he said ; they sold . ' Our figure ? ' Doctor MacDonald asked , almost casually , after the pause of scarcely an instant . No , ' Mr. Munn answered . He did not look at Doctor MacDonald . Licked , ' Doctor MacDonald said . Mr. Munn slowly raised his gaze . But Doctor MacDonald was looking away . He was looking out the window , and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Licked . ' Doctor MacDonald continued to look out the little window . Mr. Munn followed his gaze . Outside the window , there was a bough with the leaves putting out , golden-tinged and pubescent . I reckon they just did n't have it in them , ' Doctor MacDonald remarked . I did what I could , ' Mr. Munn told him . Then added , And Sills did . ' It just was n't in them , ' Doctor MacDonald said . One way or another , that 's what a man does . What 's in him . A man goes along , and the time comes , even if he 's looking the other way not noticing , and the thing in him comes out . It was n't something happening to him made him do something , the thingp356was in him all the time . He just did n't know . Till the time came . No , ' Mr. Munn answered , sitting up on the cot , feeling an alarm stir obscurely in him . No , ' and hesitated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost amusedly , Doctor MacDonald looked down at him . Do n't kid yourself , ' he said . Take the Professor , now . Him doing nothing but teaching his boys and reading his books , all that old history and stuff . You 'd never guessed it , but look what came outer him . ' Mr. Munn stood up . Did you ever notice , ' Doctor MacDonald asked , how what happens to people seems sort of made to order for them ? When you think about it . ' Why do n't matter ! ' Mr. Munn exclaimed , and jerked his arm forward in a violent , sweeping gesture of dismissal . We 're licked . The reason for things is gone . For what we did . Like flood water going down and leaving trash and stuff up in a tree . ' He jabbed his forefinger at the other man 's breast . That 's you , ' he asserted , left high and dry . Stuck up in a tree . ' Then , more quietly , he added : And me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his shoulder , and said , Take it easy . ' Mr. Munn sat down again . They talked of the trial , which would begin in two more days . As he started out , behind Mr. Dickey , who had come to let him out of Doctor MacDonald 's cell , his glance fell upon the door of the cell where Trevelyan had been . An old man was in there now , lying on the cot , his thin body lax and huddled like a pile of old clothes . He was in for murder . He had gone out to milk one morning , and had brought the milk in and strained it and put it away ; then , with an ice-pick , he had killed his wife as she leaned over the stove preparing breakfast , then his pregnant daughter , who was lying in bed , then thep357young child at her side . He had killed the son-in-law with a rifle when he came back to the house from feeding the stock . He had called the sheriff . Then he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been asleep when the sheriff came for him . Now , in his cell , he lay on his cot , only stirring to reply to questions . He answered questions with a dazed and innocent patience , like a man scarcely aroused from sleep . Mr. Munn could not recall his name . Nuts , ' Mr. Dickey said , and nodded toward the cell where the man lay on the cot . Outside , when he stood in the courthouse yard , he saw the sunshine falling over the roofs of the buildings and on the stones and the young grass . People were moving up and down the street . People he knew . He walked soberly across the square toward his office . He had gone to the jail afraid to tell Doctor MacDonald what the board had done . He had been afraid of the way DoctorMacDonald might take it . He should have known , he thought now , the way it would be : Doctor MacDonald standing there in the middle of the cell floor , his weight forward off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacDonald who had laid a hand on his shoulder , and had said , Take it easy . ' It had gone past Doctor MacDonald and had never shaken him . But the next day when he saw Doctor MacDonald he was not so sure . Watching him stand at the cell door , ready to call Mr. Dickey , Doctor MacDonald said suddenly , Do n't it smell in here to you ? ' Mr. Munn turned to look at him . Do n't it stink ? ' Doctor MacDonald demanded . Yes , ' Mr. Munn admitted , aware , anew , of the fetid , almost sweet odor , as of rottenness , I reckon it does , a little . ' It stunk mightily to me , at first , ' Doctor MacDonald said ,  |p358but  it do n't seem like it stinks now . A man gets used to a thing . It gets natural to him . ' He stopped moving about , as he had been doing , his carpet slippers making a dry , sliding noise on the concrete . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting so natural . It looks like a stink oughter stay a stink to a man . ' Mr. Munn grinned , thinking it a joke . Then he noticed that Doctor MacDonald was not grinning . Mr. Munn let the muscles of his face relax . Doctor MacDonald lay down on the cot , staring up at the ceiling . Mr. Munn called for Mr. Dickey . While Mr. Dickey was coming , Doctor MacDonald said , If I get out , I 'm figuring on leaving this country . ' Leaving ? ' Mr. Munn echoed , surprise in his tone . Doctor MacDonald nodded . Yeah , ' he replied , adding , but not so quick anybody 'd think he was running inc out . ' Mr. Munn did not answer for an instant . Where you going ? ' he then asked . He was aware of the unevenness in his own voice . That unevenness , which he noticed , detachedly as in the voice of another person , defined for him the sense of confusion , betrayal , that at Doctor MacDonald 's words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the first tremor of a landslip . Out West somewhere , I reckon , ' Doctor MacDonald was saying matter-of-factly . Arizona , New Mexico , I do n't know . Somewhere where people have n't caught up with themselves yet . ' Mr. Dickey was coming , his keys jangling as he searched for the right one . I 'm not staying round here , ' Doctor MacDonald added . I might get used to the way this country stinks . ' By seven o'clock in the morning on the first day of the trial of Doctor MacDonald on charges of conspiracy and arson , the courthouse square was crowded . The troops kept the court/house yard clear . When the doors were opened , the troops permitted only five or six men at a time to approach the building , and at the door each man was searched for arms . By halfpasteight word came out that the courtroom was full . Although the crowd thinned somewhat , it did not disperse . The people were restless , but unusually silent . When Mr. Munn and ProfessorBall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people made way for them , gazing curiously at the faces of the women , and after they had passed talking in low tones , identifying them . Now and then a man would speak to Professor Ball , who would raise the bandaged right hand in a kind of grave salute . Cordelia walked beside him , leaning on his left arm . She was very pale . A voice from the crowd called out to her , Do n't you worry , Miz MacDonald , we 'll take keer of him . ' She gave no sign of having heard . Professor Ball raised his bandaged hand in decorous salute . A scuffling began at the point in the crowd where the voice had called . Another voice cried , Hit him again ! ' The soldiers tried to force a way into the crowd toward the spot ; but they could not . Then the disturbance was over . At the courthouse door the soldiers stopped them . While the women waited just inside , one of the soldiers patted the men 's pockets and waistbands . Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching hands on him . They ai n't got nothing , ' the soldier said , stepping back . You can go in now , ' the lieutenant told them . It was that way every day for three days , in the morning and in the afternoon when the court resumed , the crowd thinner each time but still there , the soldiers around the courthouse yard , where the grass showed an incongruous fresh green as of some pasture corner , and the soldiers at the door . And with Professor Ball , it was the same every day , and with Cordelia . Professor Ball sat in the courtroom , very erect , with his eyesP360fixed before him as though he were paying no attention to what was going on , and his bandaged hands lying on his bony knees , as passive as stones . Cordelia walked beside him , leaning on his left arm , or sat beside him in the courtroom , still holding his arm ; but her glance rarely wavered from her husband 's face . As for Doctor MacDonald , he leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on , with his brown hands lying on the table-top before him . Or he inclined his head to hear some remark which his lawyer made in an undertone to him . Once , when almost everybody was watching a witness , Doctor MacDonald  --  Mr. Munn was almost sure  --  winked , with an air of sly humor , at Cordelia . Mr. Munn turned , as quickly as he dared , to look at Cordelia . While she watched her husband , her face was pale , but composed . But something else , certainly , some other expression , a smile , perhaps , had been there on her face ; and had fled even as he turned to surprise it . For three days the case moved without taking on definition . Only on the first day , when the jury was being impaneled , had issues taken on any form . But Wilkins , Mr. Munn thought , seemed satisfied enough about the jury . He had not used his last challenge . He acted as if he had put one over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew some of them . Some of them , he was sure , would like to see Doctor MacDonald catch it , guilty or not as a matter of fact , just because he was in the Association . But Wilkins seemed satisfied . There must be a couple on the jury who , Wilkins thought , could hold out against anything short of an absolute identification . And maybe against that . Mr. Munn tried to figure out who they were , but gave it up . Wilkins was not telling all he knew . But after the jury was impaneled , things slacked off Witness followed witness , each one adding some little detail to the picture of the raid on Bardsville . Officials of the Alta Company , and of the other companies , stood in the box , and recited , to the last penny , the costs of the warehouses that had beenP361destroyed , and the quantity and value of the tobacco that those warehouses had contained . That was what it had been , to them , not a picture of men moving in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sums which each in turn , standing in the box , read from a paper in his hand . A constable told how he had been sitting in the office and how masked men , with drawn pistols , had come in and tied him to a chair . They had brought in two other men , watchmen , and tied them up too . The masked men had stood around , the constable said , making jokes and chewing tobacco . They said they just tied us up for our own good , ' the constable said , somewhatsullenly , so we would n't git in no trouble . ' The masked men , he added , had had some trouble with their masks when they tried to spit . And the first explosion , because the police office was so near Front Street , nearly threw him out of his chair . They must-er used enough that shot to blow up the town , ' he said . Miss Lucy Mayhew , chief operator for the telephone company , lowered her bony , sallow-skinned right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusterless silk of her dress . The prosecutor asked her questions , and she answered them in a low but distinct voice , impersonal as though it were comingover a wire ; she did not lift her head when she spoke , and her hands , now and then , patted and smoothed the silk . She fixed the very minute when she had first heard a trampling on the stairs up to the telephone office , for she had just looked at her clock . It was twelve-thirty o'clock , she said . Four men came in , bursting in all at once , and they had white cloths on their faces and pistols in their hands . One of the girls screamed , she said , but she herself , she stood right up to them as good as she could . She wanted to know what their business was . And what did they say ? ' the prosecutor demanded . They said , ladies , we hate to bother you , but we just got aP362little private business in town , and we do n't want anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , and her brow wrinkled in thought . At least , that 's as good as I can remember what they said . So we got back from the switchboard . ' Did they offer you any violence ? ' They waved those pistols some , ' she said , but they did n't point them at us . One of them  --  he looked like the captain or something , because he had a white bandage on his coat sleeve  --  he just said for us to come downstairs , and he took me by the arm . And two of the other men , each one took one of the girls by the arm , and one of the girls started pulling back , and he said , lady , you better come on down or you 'll miss something bigger'n Christmas . They took us downstairs , and the man with me held my arm going down like any gentleman would a lady 's . ' One of the men had stayed upstairs , she said , and he was the one who had cut all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all the wires were cut up and pretty bad . He was the meanest-looking one , anyway , she said . Then the men made them stand back in the doorway of Gordon 's store , which had a deep doorway . At first there was n't anything , then a few men riding down the street , men with white masks on . Then some more men on horseback stopped up at the corner of Main and Jefferson , under the street light , and stayed there the whole time . Then there were the explosions , then the fire over the roofs , and one of the girls began to cry . It looked like the whole town was going to burn up , she said . But it did n't , and after a while men with guns began marching past . In military formation ? ' the prosecutor asked . I reckon you might call it that , ' she answered . It was four abreast , but not in step exactly . And they were singing and shouting some . One man got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and yelled '  --  she hesitated , smoothing her skirt . Well , it was improper language , ' she said , and thenP363he yelled out , Boys , they said we could n't , but we done it ! Then he shot off his pistol , and he hit the street light . But one of the men with us , the one that was captain , he said to one of the others , you go tell that man to move on , he 's using strong language like that , and there 's ladies here . And he went and told him , and he stopped . ' After the others had all left , all except the men on horseback under the street light at the corner , she said , she and the other operators were permitted to go back upstairs . The men had started to go up with them , and the captain was holding her by the arm , but she had said no , thanks , she did n't want any more assistance from people like that who violated the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Miss Lucy Mayhew there was old Doctor Potter , who had been picked up the night of the raid , going home from a call . Now , in the witness box , he was still furious , still fuming and biting his words off , as though no time had elapsed and the outrage were still at hand . Then there were the other men who had been picked up , and the station agent , and a drummer who had been staying at the hotel and who had watched everythingfrom his window . For a moment Mr. Munn thought that this might be a man the prosecution was counting on . He had seen a tall man on a bay horse , or what looked like a bay horse , he said , for the light was n't so good . The man seemed to be in charge , or something . And the man was a tall man , and lanky . Like him , ' he said , and nodded toward Doctor MacDonald . But there was nothing there , Mr. Munn thought . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cross-examination . You say it was a tall man you saw ? ' Wilkins asked conversationallyof the drummer . Yes , sir , ' the drummer said . By the way , Mr. Tupper , ' Wilkins asked , still conversationally , where did you say you 're from ? '  |p364Huntsville  , Alabama , ' the drummer replied . Well , I 've never been in Alabama , and I ca n't say exactly how men grow down there '  --  and he hesitated , to cast an appraising glance over the witness , who was a shortish man , and thin  --  but round here the country produces a right smart of pretty well-set-up fellows . Like my client , there . ' He hesitated again , waiting for the laughter , which came . Suddenly , he flung out an accusing finger at the witness , and his voice mounted : Did you positively , beyond shadow and peradventure of a doubt , identify this man ? ' Well ' the man paused . Well , ' Wilkins snapped ; then added casually : I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suggestions to these gentlemen '  --  he indicated the jury  --  that you would n't back up . In here , or , ' he added in an ingratiating tone , outside . ' I object , Your Honor '  --  the prosecutor was on his feet . I object ; that 's intimidation of the witness ! ' Blandly , in a pained surprise , Wilkins turned . I did n't mean a thing , ' he declared . One after another they mounted the stand , and raised the right hand , and listened while the words were said to them :  --  solemnly swear  --  will be the truth  --  nothing but the truth . So help you God . ' I do , ' each one said , clearly or mumblingly , in answer to that aimless , dreary intonation . How many times , Mr. Munn thought , how many times he had heard those words ! Day after day , in this room , addressed to all sorts of people , who raised the right hand , swearing . He thought : the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was telling the truth . The officials , with their pieces of paper on which the figures were written , down to a last penny , they were telling the truth : their truth . That was what the event was to them . And the constable , the truth to him  --  what had stuck in his mind and what he would always mention , for yearsP365to come now , when he told anybody about that night , what would stay in his mind when he was very old and his past had begun to flow from him and leave only a few little , dead fragments , stranded out of time  --  the truth to him was the way the men had had trouble with their masks when they tried to spit . And Miss Mayhew would always remember the tangle of cut wires in the office , just that , and the man 's hand holding her arm coming downstairs . That was the truth to her . But her truth , and the constable 's truth , and the truths of the others , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing seizable and namable , that reeling moment of certainty and fulfillment when the air had swollen ripely with the blast . But that had gone . Like the blink of an eye ; and would not come back . Even that self he had been had slipped from him , and could only be glimpsed now , paling and reproachful , in fits as when the breeze worries a rising mist . The truths of those people were not the truth that had been his that night ; but that truth was his no longer . The truth : it devoured and blotted out each particular truth , each individualman 's truth , it crushed truths as under a blundering tread , it was blind . He scarcely listened to the witnesses . He watched Doctor MacDonald leaning back in his chair , at ease , it seemed , and attentive only out of courtesy . What was Doctor MacDonald 's truth ? He had never asked himself that question before . Or he watched Cordelia . Her truth , what was it ? The witnesses mounted the stand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For witness after witness , he waived cross-examination , or asked some single perfunctory question , contemptuous in its perfunctoriness . Until Mr. Al Turpin came to the stand . But even then , at first , Wilkins did not change . Al Turpin was a beefy man , blockishly built , with a swarthy skin and thinning , greasy-looking hair . On top of his overalls , P366he wore a brown wool coat . He would speak heavily and deliberately for a moment or two , then stop in the middle of a sentence , as though he had forgotten what he was there for , as though if he ceased to speak the scene before him might fade into unreality . While the people watched him , he would blink slowly . Then , at a word from the prosecutor , he would shake his head apologetically , humbly , like a man started out of a drowse , and would wet his lips and resume . A man moved down the aisle , almost on tiptoe , and approached the table where Wilkins and Doctor MacDonald sat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a gesture from Wilkins , Doctor MacDonald leaned forward , too . Mr. Munn watched them , trying to place the man who had come in . Then he remembered him as a cousin of Wilkins . Wilkins looked at his watch . Doctor MacDonald was nodding at something the man was saying , and Wilkins snapped shut his watch . Then the man went out , tiptoeing up the aisle , for the heavy , deliberate voice of Al Turpin was still speaking , giving the testimony .  --  I was a member of the Association , ' he was saying , and I had my crop in the Association . Going on thirty-five thousand pounds , it was , and fair to middling , the season being what it was and -- I object , Your Honor , ' Wilkins said , very loud . Al Turpin turned his slow gaze upon him , with an expression of relief , almost , or of gratitude . I object that this testimony is irrelevant to this case . The poundage of Mr. Turpin 's crop and his relations with the Association -- Objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped the edge of the table before him . Al Turpin resumed . What he got for his crop was n't bad as some years , he said , but the waiting , that was bad , andP367people said the price would go down , that the Association was losing members . Wilkins objected , but was overruled . Then I heard some talk around , ' Al Turpin continued , how some men over in Hunter County was getting together to do something about the way things was Was this represented to you as a terrorist organization ? ' the prosecutor demanded . I object , ' Wilkins said , rising and waving his arm . My opponent is leading the witness ! ' Objection overruled . ' But Your Honor ' Wilkins did not sit down . Objection overruled . ' Will you please answer the question ? ' the prosecutor said to Al Turpin . I ca n't say as it was , if I rightly know . They just said it was some folks getting together and gon na do something . That 's what -- I object that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Wilkins exclaimed , almost shouting . Objection sustained , ' the judge said , then added : The witnesswill please confine himself to matters of direct observation . ' Al Turpin looked about him , working his big hands slowly on his knees . I been doing the best I know , ' he said . He paused , seemed to sink in upon himself , then began : One day a fellow come to me , I ca n't say for sure what day it was , but it was long ' fore setting-out time last spring . He told me his name , but it 's done slipped my mind , it looks like . But he was a sorter middle-size man , you might say '  --  he stopped , broodingly , for a moment  --  and sandy-haired . And he said to me , Mr. Turpin , you do n't look like no man would let hisselfbe knocked down and spit on . I been a peace-abiding man , but I said , Well , ai n't no man wiped his foot on me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P368Wilkins shoved his chair back with a sudden scraping on the dry floor . I object ! This is hearsay , pure and simple . This middle-size man '  --  and he pronounced the words with a hint of mimicry of Al Turpin 's voice  --  this sandy-haired man whose name the witness ca n't remember The judge struck the desk with his gavel . Objection sustained , ' he ruled . But the attorney for the defense will observe the dignity of this court . ' Did you or did you not , Mr. Turpin , ' the prosecutor demanded , become a member of any secret society ? ' He turned away from the witness and looked , with a sudden glint of cunningand satisfaction , at the packed roomful of people , and then at Wilkins . Al Turpin did not answer . He seemed to be lost , fumblingly , within himself . Wilkins was looking at his watch . Answer yes or no ! ' Al Turpin managed to fix his glance , painful and appealing , upon the face of the prosecutor . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this society to destroy plant beds and barns and to force membership in the Association of Growers of Dark Fired Tobacco ? ' I object ! ' Wilkins almost shouted . He is leading the wit-ness . ' Objection overruled . ' The prosecutor leaned toward Al Turpin : Answer yes or no ! ' Yes , ' Al Turpin replied . Was the name of this society The Free Farmers ' Brotherhoodfor Protection and Control ? ' Al Turpin 's painful gaze left the prosecutor 's face and slowly moved over the other faces , more distant , there before him . His bulk shifted slightly in the chair , making it creak in the quietness of the room . I object ! That is irrelevant . '  |p369Objection  overruled . ' The prosecutor looked at Al Turpin demandingly . Yes , ' Al Turpin said . Wilkins , Mr. Munn observed , was looking at his watch , covertly , beneath the level of the table . Now , Mr. Turpin , ' the prosecutor went on , dropping into a tone of familiarity and lounging closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he hesitated , then pronounced the words with almost a grimace , as though they had an evil taste on the tongue  --  this Free Farmers ' Brotherhoodfor Protection and Control . Or whatever it is . ' Wilkins seemed about to rise ; then restrained himself . Turpin moved his tongue over his lips , looked at the prosecutor , and then cast a sudden , wide , wild glance over the fixed faces . Mr. Turpin -- Al Turpin let his head sink a little , humbly , and said : It was one night last spring ; I ca n't say as I recollect the day it was , but it was in May . I went down the dirt road out past my house , like they said for me to , and I seen a man on a horse standing there on one side the road , and he said to me , Fair weather . And I said to him , Fairer tomorrow . Like they told me to . And I went on till I come to that old tumble-down church . A nigger church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I went round to the back and I seen some horses -- Mr . Munn thought , It 's coming . He felt the weight of the silence behind him . He looked at Doctor MacDonald . He had not moved.  --  and hitched my horse to a sapling . Sassafras , I reckon . I stood there and listened . A horse tromped a little over in the bushes . Then I started walking towards the church ' A long time back , Mr. Munn thought , how long ; but it was as before him now , suddenly , in his mind , that open space beforeP370the dark mill , that open , lighter space before which he had paused that night , the road dipping down across it beside the fallen rail fence , and distantly , the sound of water on stones . That momentary prickling of the spine as he moved into that space , alone , that was with him now , the eyes watching from shadow.  --  and after while they took me inside and stood me in front of a light with it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said the oath for me to say , a little bit at a time . And I said it . ' His voice stopped , ponderously , as though of its own dead weight . Then , his bulk shifting , he said : I did n't know how it was gon na be , what I was getting into . I never would taken it . Not a oath before God . ' His voice stopped , leaving him there , awkward , motionless . Mr. Turpin , repeat to the best of your ability the oath . ' I object ! ' Wilkins was on his feet . He 's leading the witness . ' Objection overruled ! ' Mr. Turpin , ' the prosecutor said sharply . A thing , ' Al Turpin said , a thing do n't stick in a man 's head so good . I ca n't say the words , like they were . But I 'll say what they went on to say . It said I object ! ' Wilkins cried . This testimony is not admissible . This oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can not remember it . If the welfare of my client is to depend The gavel struck the desk . Mr. Wilkins ! ' the judge exclaimed . Your Honor ? ' You will observe the proper dignity of this court , Mr. Wilkins . ' Your Honor , ' Mr. Wilkins said , gravely , elaborately , I object to the testimony of the witness on the grounds of inad-missibility . ' The judge leaned forward , wearily , and poured himself a glass of water from the china pitcher , which had blue flowersP371painted upon it . While he drank , the people in the room watched him . He put the glass down , and wiped his lips with a handkerchief . The jury will retire , ' he said then , and stuffed the handkerchief into his pocket . His eyes seemed to be closed while the jurymen went out . They moved awkwardly , clumpingly , scraping their shoes on the boards . When the door had closed behind them , the judge roused himself and said , Mr. Wilkins , will you present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted into the proceedings of this court ? ' It was ruled that the testimony concerning the oath was adrnissible . But when the jury had been summoned , and the men were moving back to their place , looking covertly at the faces of the people before them as though to surprise there the knowledge which had been denied them , the clock in the tower of the courthouse struck . It struck four times , the resonanceof each impact dying away , thinning into a drowsy hum like the sound of distant bees . At the motion of Wilkins , over the protest of the prosecutor , the court was adjourned . The people rose , and began to move sluggishly toward the doors . Wilkins was sitting beside Doctor MacDonald , talking earnestly to him . Doctor MacDonald was shaking his head . I 'll wait , ' Mr. Munn told Professor Ball , and Professor Ball nodded , not saying anything , not even looking at Mr. Munn , and moved away . Cordelia , at his side , clutched his arm . The people thinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two deputies , leaving Wilkins there alone at his table , on which the scattered papers lay . Mr. Munn started to go over and speak to him , then turned away . He left the courtroom , and walked down the dim corridorsand across the yet crowded yard to the jail . He sat on the cot , aware of that faint , sweetish stench , and listened while Doctor MacDonald moved slowly back and forth in the cell , talking . The man who had come into the courtroom , thatP372cousin of Wilkins , had come to tell Wilkins that the soldiers had rounded up just that afternoon six men , and every one of them had been in the band Turpin belonged to . That was what had started Wilkins to stalling , Doctor MacDonald said . They got Turpin to turn all of them in . This place 'll be running over by night . They just brought another fellow in before you came . He was in Turpin 's band , too , I reckon . ' It 's easy , ' Mr. Munn said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him bail we could have guessed . They 've got that arson indictment on Turpin , and they 're making a deal . ' If you want to see what makes it stink in here worse'n usual , ' Doctor MacDonald observed , you can go look down at the far end . They just put Turpin in . ' He stopped moving about , and reached out to grasp strongly one of the bars of the door . But you can bet they put him in one by himself . They want to keep him all in one piece . ' Mr. Munn rose abruptly , and put out his hand . I 've got to go , ' he said . I just wanted to find out how bad it was . ' Morbid , huh ? ' Doctor MacDonald remarked , and grinned . Mr. Munn went back to his office . He sat there , without making a motion , at his desk , and stared out at the leafing trees . He thought , those trees changed in the spring and you did n't notice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall , when the leaves dropped away , day after day , until , all at once , you saw the final bareness . He saw the shotgun in the corner , and the rifle . He thought of the deer hunt , down near Reelfoot , and the men around the stove , in the cabin , at night . And of that last afternoon hunting birds with Mr. Christian . He stayed in his office , and the light faded over the roofs across the square . He hated to go to the hotel and tell Professor Ball . He hated to look at Cordelia , knowing what he knew . P373The next morning Mr. Munn woke up very early . The light was just beginning to come . He lay on his back , looking up at the ceiling , and thought of the cold , anonymous light unfolding , slowly , over the countryside , over the fields and roads and hedges and the woods , that would be dark longest , and over the roofs of the town , and in bedrooms like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt very tired , but wakeful with a detachment and clarity of mind , as when a man comes out of a fever . At six o'clock Professor Ball came to his door and he got up . Professor Ball said that he had n't been able to sleep either . They were the first people in the dining-room . They ate withouttalking . When he had finished , Mr. Munn said that he had to go down to the office a minute to leave a note for his secretary , and would come back in time to go with them to the courthouse . Professor Ball said that he would go up and see if the girls were ready for breakfast . Mr. Munn started to go out the back way of the hotel , to take the short cut down the alley to his office , then changed his mind . He wanted to get a newspaper . He got the newspaper , glanced quickly at the headlines concerning the trial , and with the paper under his arm , walked down the square and turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , and spoke to them . At the drugstore under his office , a clerk was propping the front doors open . It 's sure beginning to look tough , ' the clerk said , for that fellow MacDonald . I was saying just yesterday , it looked like Do you think so ? ' Mr. Munn said , and turned up the stairs to his office . He unlocked the door to the office and entered . He leaned over his desk and scrawled a few lines to the girl . Then he raised the window so that the place could be airing out . Clear sunlight now fell over the western side of the square . People , almost a crowd , were beginning to congregate . He looked atp374his watch . It was getting on toward time . He left the door unlocked , for the girls should be coming in almost any time now , and went down the back stairs to the alley . He saw no one in the alley . He went into the stable to look at his mare . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a few minutes to wait . He did not want to see Professor Ball and the others until it was time to go . It was n't that they would ask him questions ; it was n't that , but he would discover their eyes fixed upon him . He unfolded the paper , and leaning against the stall door , began to read the account of the proceedings of the previous afternoon . He read on , but realized that the words were meaning nothing to him . He stuffed the paper into his pocket , and stood there . He entered the hotel by the back way and climbed the narrow back stairs . On the second floor , at the head of the stairs , he saw Isabella , waiting . Hurry ! ' she said to him , whispering breathlessly , go away . Soldiers , and some other men , they came for you , they 're hunting you . Hurry The whiteness of her face was there before him in the dim hall.  |p375MOST  of the time during the day , if the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was safest , he thought , and besides , he did n't want to get the Proudfits into any trouble if he could help it . On the hill to one side of the Proudfit house was the place he usually stayed . The limestone humped out of the soil there , not jaggedly , but in gray , somnolent-looking masses rounded by weather and furred with lichen . Cedars grew there , with roots that grappled under the limestone and in the crevices . The crevices were filled with rotted leaves and cedar needles and earth , black with humus , which had sifted down . In the winter the moisture collected in those crevices and the cold made icy wedges to thrust , little by little , year after year , toward the heart of the stone . At the foot of the bluff , in the bed of the creek by the Proudfit house , the round boulders stood here and there above the surface of the water . High up , on the bluff side of the hill , a spring poured out of an archway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear water eddied ceaselessly , braiding and swelling , swaying the young fronds of fern and the grass which trailed lushly down to the surface , spilling over the lip of stone and plunging down the slope to join the creek below . Soon 's I laid eyes on hit , ' Willie Proudfit had said to Mr. Munn , come-en sliden down that rock that-away , I says , thar my house will set . Sometimes a-nights I lays in bed and I kin hear hit . I lays in bed and I kin recollect the times out in the dry country I laid out somewheresa-nights and studied on water . In this country the Lord 's done give a man water whichever way he turns ,
