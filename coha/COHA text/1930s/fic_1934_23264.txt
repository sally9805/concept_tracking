THE FAMILY MAN A STORY BY LAUREN CE KIRK E AcH of the great London railway stations has a flavor of its own . Spiritualists might prefer to call it an aura ; but I have no eighth sense , and to me this individuality is sometimes a flavor and sometimes a smell . Charing Cross and Victoria both have a homely scent reminding one of the roast beef of suburban Sundays and the dingy propriety of the South Coast resorts . Paddington tastes much better than this . It has a soft relaxing air . There you can listen in to the west along those miles and miles of rail , hear the cows shuffling in lush Somersetshire meadows , and think of dairies and Devonshire cream . Liverpool Street I hardly know , although I imagine it to be very brisk and bracing . But Euston , St. Pancras , and King 's Cross , in their several ways have a sharp tang of the north , a promise of heather and high winds , of green fairways and impenetrable gorse . Of all these King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station from which I used to go home from school , and I still own to a thrill when I see the wide span of its sooty arch in the distance . It is also the place where I first discovered the Family Man . Our original meeting was somewhat abrupt . It was during the War , and the air raid began when I was on my way to catch the night train to Edinburgh . My taximan was obviously a bad driver at the best of times . In addition he wasgun-shy ; and when he started dodging imaginary bombs , regardless of the rest of the traffic , the journey became unpleasantly exciting . We missed a bus by inches at the entrance to the station , and when we finally drew up with a jerk , he tumbled out of the driver 's seat and scurried off in all his voluminous coats in the direction of the underground lavatory without even waiting for his fare . The station was pitch dark and there was n't a porter to be seen ; so I retrieved my two bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the platform . I could just make out the dim shape of the train in the darkness and was proceeding toward it at a fairly dignified pace when I heard the beginning of that horrible whining in the air . It was that most unpleasant type of whining which gets louder and higher and higher and nearer ; and the next thing I knew was that I had tumbled nose first , bags and all , into the nearest carriage , while after a flash and a deafening explosion the whole station was dripping bricks and glass around me . Some time later when I began to pick myself up , I saw the sleeping-car attendant ( for it was into the sleeping-car that I had tumbled ) standing in the corridor and looking at me disapprovingly over his glasses . I did not notice much more about him at the moment except that he held a candle in one hand and a flimsy sheet of paper in the other . What troubled me was that I had a major 's badges on my sleeves and ought not to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By Jove , that was a near thing ! " I said as I dusted my khaki slacks . He replied politely enough : " Yes , sir . Tickets please . " Obediently and ashamedly I showed him my ticket which he examined carefully by the light of the candle . Then having at last satisfied himself that it was genuine , he looked at me over his glasses . " And the sleeping-car ticket ? " That in turn was subjected to the same scrutiny , then he added : " And the name , sir ? " I told him and he studied his list . Finally reassured as regards my credentials , he led the way down the corridor . " This will be yours , sir . Number 7 . What time do you wish to be called ? " There was a fusillade going on outside , but I did not dare call attention to it . " About seven thirty , " I said nervously . " And will you have tea and biscuits or tea and bread and butter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very good , sir . I shall now fetch your baggage . " With that he departed slowly along the corridor with his candle and presently returned with one of my bags which he put on the rack , remarking " That 's one . " Then the same dignified performance was repeated with the other , and he concluded " And that 's two . " At this moment there was a second whining in the air , and after another fierce detonation the station was again dripping bricks and glass . After it was all over I noticed that the attendant was shaking , not with fear but with indignation . He slowly pulled a large gold watch from his waistcoat pocket and looked at it . " Drat those confounded ' Unsl " he muttered . " We 're six minutes be'ind time already . " Such was my first encounter with the Family Man . It makes him appear as though he had a rather forbidding personality , but that is not true , although he was certainly reserved and distant . It was nearly four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was engaged on some legal business which for a long period involved a journey from London to Edinburgh or vice versa once or twice a week . I always traveled by night , and on the very first trip I found him there waiting in the corridor , looking at me over his spectacles , with the flimsy sheet of paper in his hand . " Tickets , if you please ! " Then after a further glance at me : " The name is Kirk , if I remember right . " There is nothing more endearing than to be unexpectedly remembered , and after that I was always bitterly disappointed if I happened to be traveling when he was off duty . But that occurred only about once in four times , and after a few months I began to know him quite well . As well , that is , as he would permit . For he telt his position of trust and responsibility and kept his distance . He would never chatter with the passengers or become familiar . His job was to look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption could gain any favor from him ; but if he knew you and for some reason you had failed to book a sleeper , there was always an empty berth mysteriously locked away , however crowded the train . He would show you into it with a disapproving shake of the head to remind you that you must n't except any such indulgence a second time . At that period he was a man of about fifty-four , slow in his movements and his thoughts . The eyes that looked over his spectacles were blue and serious , and his hair was going gray on the temples . His figure , like his manner , was pleasantly solid , his trousers slightly bagged at the knee , and his face was scrubbed to a bluish tinge . His name was Roberts , Henry Roberts , and he had been on the dining cars before he had been promoted to the sleepers . That was all he ever told me about himself . The rest I had to fill in on my own . I did it by calling him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , and he the strict but kindly father . I guessed that he was working off some inhibited parental instinct on us , for his care of us was unremitting . On one occasion when we stopped at Grantham and a porter came along with a trolley of milk-cans , I heard his outraged voice , " Get out of ' ere , ca n't you , with them nasty rattling cans . My people 's just got to sleep . " And another time at York , when the carriage examiner came tapping along the wheels , I saw him standing on the platform watching him , daring him , as it were , to tap any louder than a sucking dove . Very often I was dead tired when I arrived at Waverly or King 's Cross for the night journey , but I knew that I should sleep well under Mr. Roberts ' fatherly care . He seemed to take from me not only my tickets , but all my worldly cares as well . He gave me the same feeling of security as the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never paid any attention to his first knock in the morning . But his second knock had the ring of authority in it , and one had to say " Come in . " Then in he would come in his waistcoat and shirtsleeves , and hand me the oblong tray with the tea and bread and butter on it . He was English , not Scotch , and he always had a dig at the Scotch climate . If we were going north , hewould begin " Fresh wind this morning , sir " ; but if we were on the southward journey , it would always be " Pleasant change to-day , sir , nice and mild . " Then as he left me to my tea , he always paused at the door and produced the gold watch from his waistcoat pocket . " Running up to time this morning , " he would remind me or , " We 'll be in in forty minutes . " This meant that I must n't linger too long over my tea . I should not see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he would produce a porter for me , look round to see that I had n't forgotten anything , be very surprised when I gave him a tip , and hope that he would be seeing me again next week . This went on for nearly a year , then at last my work in Edinburgh came to an end and I made my last journey south . I was very sorry to say good-by to the Family Man , and after I had shaken hands I gave him my card and told him to be sure to come and see me if ever I could be of any service to him . As I walked away , he stood there at the door of the carriage , looking after me with exactly the same expression as my nurse wore when I first went off to boarding school . I too had a cold feeling in my bones as though I had definitely left home . I did not expect to see the Family Man again , for I could n't imagine him requiring any help from me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received them . However , about four years later my clerk came into my office and informed me that there was a Mr. Roberts outside who wished to see me on private business . A moment later he came in . He did not look a day older , though he seemed ill at ease  --  but perhaps that was because I had never seen him away from his official surroundings or in ordinary clothes . Anyway he began with the familiar sentence , " Nice and mild to-day , sir . Real English weather . " I told him how very pleased I was to see him again , gave him a chair , and offered him a cigarette , which he refused . Apparently he was still working , for he volunteered the information that the wind was a bit fresh in Edinburgh the day before . After that he left me to make most of the conversation , and I saw that whatever it was he had on his mind , he found it difficult to make a beginning and tell me . At length I asked point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , Mr. Roberts ? " He gave me that familiar look over his glasses . " No , " he began , " No  --  at least , not at present . But you see , sir , I 'll be sixty next year . " That was n't the kind of trouble over which I could help anyone . " You surprise me . I should n't have called you a day over fifty , " I said encouragingly . " And I do n't feel a day over fifty either , sir , " he returned . " I smokes me two pipes a day , and has me glass of beer . ' Owever , there it is , I 'm sixty next year , and at sixty they retires us . " " I see ! That 's a bit hard . Any pension ? " " Oh , yes , sir . There 's a scheme . Contributory , you know . They runs these things very well on the railways . ' Owever , it ai n't the money I 'm afraid of ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me what it is . " " Well , I 'm married , sir . There ai n't a better wife in the world than Lucy . And a nice ' ome we 've got up ' Ighgate way . Two boys too , fine boys , brought up proper in the old way . " This puzzled me . " Then surely , " I went on , " I do n't see what you 've got to worry about . You 've earned a little ease if anybody has . You ought to be looking forward to your retirement . After all , you ca n't have seen much of your family all these years , and if they 're as charming as you say .. . " " They 're all that and more , sir , " he interrupted . " ' Owever it ai n't going to be quite so easy as you might think . " " But why not ? " Abruptly he stood up . " Well , I do n't think I 'll be troubling you any more this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally abruptly he sat down again , heavily . " There 's another lady up in Edinburgh , sir . " " Ohl " " Yes , sir . Maggie 's her name , and a fine woman she is too . " " Any  --  any family ? " " Yes , sir , two girls . Pretty as Punch they are . There ai n't a finer pair of girls in the whole country . " I gazed at him a long time doubtfully , then I asked : " You did n't actually marry this second lady , did you ? " His reply was most indignant . " Indeed I did , sir . Married ' ern both . In church . I 'm very particular the way I treats a woman . " For some moments I sat fiddling with my pencil in silence . I was thinking how right I had been to call him the Family Man , and how wrong I had been to suppose that it was a repressed parental complex which he was working off on the care of his passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective instinct . It was really a magnificent record . The girls in Edinburgh , the boys in London , and a mixed family of passengers in the train . However , I was a lawyer and I knew how bigamy was treated in the courts . Meanwhile Mr. Roberts was talking in that aggrieved and injured tone which he employed when the train was car attendant sees what 's going on , I six minutes behind time . can tell you . Disgraceful it is . They " It 's this retiring at sixty that 's done ought to ' ave to sign the register , if you it , " he said . " We 've carried on very ask me , going north ! " well these last fourteen years , and all " Yes , Mr. Roberts , but they do n't been very ' appy . You see , I gets actually marry twice . " about the same time off at each end of He shook his head solemnly . the journey , and there was no reason " Oh , well . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie to think I was n't treating her if I 've got to retire , what 's going to right . She 's a fine woman . There happen then ? Lucy and the boys will ai n't a better wife than ' er in the ' ole expect me to come ' ome to London , world , nor than Lucy neither . " and Maggie and the girls will expect It was very hard to argue on these me to come ' ome to Edinburgh . I lines , and I then began to ask him a ca n't do both , and one of them will few practical questions . want to know the reason why . It 's " You say you married both times in going to be very awkward in my ' umble church ? " opinion . " " Yes , sir . " " It 's going to be very awkward in " In your own name ? " deed , " I agreed . " Oh , yes , sir . I 've never done any- " I 'll admit that bigamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , " he continued . " But look at it common name . " this way . I get about one night off in " And how about money ? Did n't five , and sometimes it 's one end and Lucy  --  or er Maggie  --  ever ask questions sometimes the other  --  but that 's a about your wages and where they were ' oliday really ; it 's the days that 's my going ?

It was Lucy I married first , " Well , Maggie did , sir , but I never been married three years when I met tells a woman more than she ought to Maggie , and all those three years I 'd know . And anyway there was the tips spent almost every other day in Edin ? they could n't know ' ow much they burgh . You know Edinburgh and were .

I had only asked him I knew he was speaking the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite understood . necessity of giving him some advice . " Yes , yes , " I said . " But the law I do n't know whether my learned does n't allow two home lives . " colleagues would have approved of my " Lots of people ' as them , sir . line of thought , but this was a private People in positions too . A sleeping- conversation , and my first question was : " Is there no hope of your keeping your job on after sixty ? " He shook his head . " No , sir , I 've tried that , but we 've got to make way for younger men . " I then drew a deep breath . " Very well then , " I said , " the possibilities appear to be as follows : First of all you can throw yourself on the mercy of both your wives . From what I know about women , that is not likely to be a great success  --  all the more so because you appear to have been a model husband to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw yourself on the mercy of the police , and I dare say you would get off lighter that way  --  though it will probably mean hard labor . On the other hand if you 're not prepared to stand the racket , then you must desert one or both your families , and do it quickly . " " Oh , I could n't do that , sir , " he protested . " You 'll do it compulsorily if you go to prison ! And I do n't feel in my own mind that you ought to go to prison . " " Nor do I , sir . After all I 've never done any ' arm . In fact I 've made more people ' appy than most . " " I know , Mr. Roberts , but I 'm afraid that the law is n't concerned with the people you 've made happy . Indeed it is unusually hard on a man if he does it in this particular way . " He nodded his head , and I added : " I 'm desperately sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem in which I can not help at all . " Slowly and sadly he then got up and shook my hand . " That 's just what I thought , sir , but I 'm very much obliged to you for listening . " With that he walked unsteadily to the door . I do not know whether his reeling was due to emotion or to his being accustomed to the rocking corridors of the Flying Scotsman . All the next year I waited for the inevitable headline in the newspapers . " Bigamist on the Sleeping Cars " or " Double Life of a Railwayman . " But I never saw it , and 1 never had any more news of the Family Man . Another three years passed and one evening I found myself at a loose end in York , where I had gone to see an important client . Having two hours to spare before my train back to London , I went and had a look at the Minster , and I was just gazing up at the lovely rose window when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never ' ave thought to meet you ' ere like this , sir . " I turned round , and there he was , looking as young and as well scrubbed as ever . I shook his hand warmly ; and looking reverently at the window , he continued : " Lovely thing , ai n't it , sir ? I never get tired of looking at that one . " After that we walked together down one of the aisles . I wanted desperately to ask what he had been doing and how he had got over his little awkwardness ; for obviously he had got over it somehow . There was a jauntiness in his step which denoted an easy mind . He was on the top of events , not under them as he had been the last time I saw him . As we came out of the Minster and paused on the steps to put on our hats ; I asked him : " Well , Mr. Roberts , what are you doing in York ? " " This is my headquarters now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did retire ? " " Yes , sir . I 've got a job on the motor service now . Of course , it ai n't like the railways . Do n't get the same class as we used to on the sleeping cars . But the hours ai n't so long . You see , we do the run north and south alternate like from ' ere . Found it funny working in the daytime after all those years on night dooty , I can tell you . ' Owever , I was lucky to get a traveling job . " I looked at him searchingly . " I expect you were ! .. . And how about that matter  --  that awkwardness ? you told me of ? " His face suddenly became very grave . " That was settled for me , " he answered sadly . " Maggie died . Flu . It 's that Edinburgh wind wot done ' er in . Just went off like that , she did . Fair knocked up over it I was too , though I suppose it saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked desperately pathetic , and I went on . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Roberts , I 'm very sorry to hear that . Still I must say that it seems to me that that was the happiest end for all concerned . " " Yes , sir , " he admitted , " I suppose that 's so . That 's wot I 've always said to myself . Not that it 's much good telling yourself things when the ' eart 's sick . .. That was one reason why I ' ad to go on working . Could n't settle down all of a sudden after that . I got it in ine blood , you know , this work and traveling and looking after folks . " We walked on a few paces in silence , then I asked : " What happened to her children when Maggie died ? " " Oh , they 're all right , sir , " he said , " living with their aunt , they are . see them once a week . They 're pretty well grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and getting on fine . " " They stayed in Edinburgh , I sup-pose ? " " Yes , sir . They did n't seem to want to move , and I did n't ask them to . In my opinion it 's safer for folks to stay in their own country . " The beautiful na  --  vet ? of this remark was charming , especially as my friend appeared to be entirely unconscious of it . After a few more paces he stoppedand pulled his gold watch from his waistcoat pocket . " Are you going back to town tonight , sir ? " he inquired . " Yes , I am . " " Then you 've got an hour and nine minutes before your train . Sixty-nine minutes exact . " He carefully put the watch back in his pocket and looked at me over his glasses . " Perhaps you 'd care to come along ' ome with me for a moment , sir . You 've got the time , and I 'd like you to meet the Missus . " This invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch so suddenly to the living Lucy when we had barely finished speaking of the regretted and departed Maggie . However , I realized how pleasant it must be for Mr. Roberts to be able to refer confidentially and without any private qualification to the " Missus " in the singular . Anyway 1 accepted . We walked slowly down two or three streets until we finally came to a little , tidy , two-storeyed , brick house , with three steps in front of it , a polished brass knocker on the door , and clean Nottingham lace curtains at the windows . As he stood aside to let me in , a cheerful buxom woman of about forty came hurrying eagerly out of the kitchen to greet him . She paused and looked disconcerted at seeing a stranger ; however , Mr. Roberts promptly introduced me . " Missus , I 've brought Mr. Kirk ' ome for a dish o ' tea . ' E 's a gentleman wot 's been a very good friend to me . " She immediately smiled and opened the door into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I 'm sure . " The sitting room was the grand room of the house , obviously only used for visitors . The furniture was a cheap set and rather pretentious , and the lithographs were of draped figures reclining aimlessly on marble . Everything , however , looked treasured and well cared for , and Mr. Roberts and the " Missus " were obviously on the best of terms . She was n't the least pretty but she was dearly a good sort , and probably a good cook and mother as well . While the tea was being made and the best cups taken out of the cupboard , Mr. Roberts sat and talked to me . He spoke with intimate knowledge on the question of road and rail competition , and it would really have been most interesting if I had been in a mood to listen . But I was n't . My trouble was that I could n't remember whether this was the establishment with two boys or two girls . Naturally I wanted to make polite inquiries , but 1 did n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask after . All the photographs in the room were of elderly people , males with mustaches and females with brooches , and that gave me no clue at all . I might perhaps have asked Mr. Roberts , but I did not want to interrupt his discourse . Moreover , the " Missus " kept hovering round , laying the table , and I was terrified of planting the smallest seed of suspicion in her mind . Finally when she had served us with tea , she came and sat beside us and listened with evident admiration while Mr. Roberts continued to enlighten me about road transport . They were charming together , the type of homely couple which is the very backbone of England ; and I simply shuddered to think how very near disaster had come to them . One thing was certain . A microbe had solved a problem with which neither the Law nor the Prophets could have ever dealt . And I blessed the Almighty for His unusual consideration in dealing with the tangle Himself instead of leaving it in the bungling and incompetent hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Roberts who , after looking at the clock , pulled his more trusted gold watch from his waistcoat pocket . " Do n't want to hurry you away , sir , " he warned me . " But the trains are running on time , and if you do n't want to run any risk . . . " In spite of this warning I lingered three minutes longer , hoping against hope that the boys ( or girls ) would come in and answer the question in my mind . But nothing happened . In the end I had to go with my curiosity unappeased . I said good-by to the " Missus , " thanked her for her hospitality , and Mr. Roberts came and walked a little way down the street to show me the way . As we parted I congratulated him . " Well , Mr. Roberts , you 've confirmed the very good impression I 've always had of you . You 've had a lucky  --  but a well-deserved escape . " He thanked me , and I added : " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this family ? I could n't ask because I 'd forgotten . " For the last time he gave me the old familiar look over his glasses . " Oh , Lucy 's the mother of the boys , " he said . Then after a slight pause , " But strictly speaking , sir , that ai n't Lucy . She 's still in London and keeping very well , I 'm glad to say . And the family too . You see , when I ' ad to make York my ' eadquarters , it did n't seem ' arcily fair to ask ' er to move  --  with the boys apprenticed and all that . And after all I 'm in London two nights a week , . . . No , sir , that 's ' Ilda you 've just seen . A widder she was , lost ' er ' usband with the flu the same year as I lost poor Maggie . So you see ' ow it was . She 's a fine woman too . In fact , there ai n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them three . "
