 | Pop Time Plays Ball Condensed from The Elks Magazine ( April , ' 32 ) Paul Gallico Sports editor of the New York " Daily News " NE out , men on first and second , the heavy batter up . The baseball crowd is on its feet bellowing for a hit . The pitcher stands motionless on his little hill , looking at the batter . He is in a hole . His arm suddenly flashes and the miracle happens . Or rather the miracles begin . The ball is a momentary streak , the batter swings and meets it , and begins the headlong dash for first base . The shortstop glides two steps to his right and the ball dives into his mitt . With no break in his easy motion he dumps the ball into the second baseman 's glove yards before the man thundering down from first comes into the bag . Now the second baseman whirls , and whistles the ball low and hard down the basepath . The first baseman is leaning far off the bag , his glove outstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be halted . There is the ball in the air in front of the waiting baseman , and there , too , is the runner , with his leg outstretched to take the last step into the bag . The ball leaps into the glove , the steel spike digs into the sack , the umpire 's arm describes a great arc , finishing with the thumb extended backward over his shoulder . The double play completed ! Here is what happened : The pitcher threw the ball a yard less than 6o feet six inches , the distance between home plate and the pitcher 's box , the yard allowing for the step permitted the pitcher toward the batter at the moment of releasing the ball . The pitch was in the air sixtenths of a second . For one hundredth of a second , the ball was in a position to be hit by the batter safely , or at all . There is a range of about a foot in the position of a ball that may be hit safely . But he swung - and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man will get down to first in four seconds . A fast man or a left-hander will do it in 3.8 or 3.9 . The fielders had four seconds to complete their play . Count four to yourself . In that time , the ball must hit the field and take its first bound in order that the fielder may judge its speed and direction , the fielder must make up his mind , come in and pick it up , take it in his throwing hand , whirl , note that  | the second baseman is in position , and toss him the ball . The ball is in the air a fraction of a second on a short toss . Now the second baseman must catch the ball , turn and get it off to first . The actual flight of the ball the go feet from second to first will consume an average of a second of time . Unless everything up to that throw has been completed in three seconds or less , the double play is foredoomed to failure . Father Time will stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game of baseball that has never been changed since Major Abner Doubleday laid out the first baseball diamond at Cooperstown , N. Y. , in 1830 , is the distance between the bases , which is 90 feet . The whole time-shattering science of the game results from that magic go paces between the bases . If the Major had made it 85 feet or 95 feet there would n't have been any game . It is exactly at go feet that man and ball stage their hairbreadth races . So it was laid out , so it has remained , and so it will remain as long as baseball is played . John McGraw has said - " Pennants are won and lost by the margin of the last step to first base , " so closely are the evolutions of fielding a batted or bunted ball and the speed of man running 9o feet allied . I took a ten-second stopwatch that split into hundredths to the last World Series , and for three days snapped it on practically every player of the series . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working from the press box , but such as they are , they are the only set of such records m existence , and to me , at least , they opened up a new vista of baseball as a really miraculous game . A fast pitcher such as Grove throws a ball approximately 16 1/2 feet a tenth of a second . Of course , if the batter is n't set to hit with the windup , and if he does n't keep his eye on the ball and begin to time it , starting his swing practically as it leaves Grove 's fingers , he is n't going to hit . With this in mind , the .40o hitter becomes indeed a miracle man , a freak of constitution , a fellow of marvelous sight and physical reaction . The timing and mechanics of the stolen base are something to marvel at . It takes the ball one and a half seconds , or a fraction less , to travel from the catcher to second base . Now for the average pitch we have an allowance of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catcher and baseman , the ball is in the air for two seconds . The successful stealer gets down and into second base in from 3.1 to 3.2 seconds . If he is any slower , he does n't make it .  | " Ten bases are stolen an the pitcher to one on the catcher , " McGraw told me . " The good base stealer feels that the pitcher is about to pitch to the plate , digs in his spikes and is off . " During the world series I put the watch on Pepper Martin , the series hero who ran the Athletics ragged on the bases , as he made two attempts to steal second . One succeeded and the other failed . His time was practically identical , 3.13 and 3.1 seconds . The first throw from catcher to second baseman was waist high ; there was no time to make the touch-out . The second time the throw was right to the bag , and he was out . A series of tests of time-plays around first base indicates that all business must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their handling of the ball within that time , and , with the exception of extraordinarily fast men or left-handers , who have a step less to take , the batter will be out . It puzzles me why baseball men have failed to put this time measure on their infield plays as a matter of training combinations to speed up their work . Where a game is played in terms of tenths and hundredths of seconds , it is easy to comprehend the immense skill and physical perfection it takes to play it . The average life of the major league ball player is seven years , because anything less than perfection will not do in the big leagues . There ; the players must be able to get down to first base in their four seconds or better . There , the infielders must have that speed and precision and judgment which will enable them to cut off that tenth of a second in the handling of the ball and keep men off the base paths . What happens to a great shortstop when he begins to slip ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps his legs have begun to go . Perhaps his arm . He is no longer within the time peak . A tenth of a second lost here , another tenth there , is translated on the other end into time for an extra step . The same thing happens to the great hitters , eventually . They can no longer time the speeding ball . The fine sensitivity of physical reaction to mental stimulus becomes dulled . Balls they would have knocked out of the lot , whiz by them or foul up off bats swung too late , and fall into waiting hands . Everything is Time in the miraculous game . Beat Time ! Partition Time ! Split up seconds into little pieces and steal half of them , cheat Time with arm and limb and wind and brain . Beat Time and you win . Let Time beat you and you lose . Baseball is Time 's own private little game .
