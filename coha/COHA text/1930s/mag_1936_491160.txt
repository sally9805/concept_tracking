LT J UST to show the fallacy of the land-buying program in Brown County , let us look for a moment upon the conditions as they exist  --  not as they exist in the eyes of some dreamer who may have read a hook or two about European stale forests . These hills were settled a hundred years ago or more by a liberty-loving people who came here mostly from the South . Either they were opposed to slavery or they were younger sons of slave-owning families who were too poor to own slaves and too proud to work with them . The Brown County soil was fertile , but much of it was rolling , hilly ground covered with a , splendid forest . There were no railroads until less than thirty years ago . Roads were bad . It was difficult to get into the county or out of it . Still , people lived here in peace and quiet . They worked hard ; they were thrifty , honest , industrious . Their needs were few and they had a large measure of contentment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youthful Government agents are now . I learned that those of the native population who really wanted to better their condition , who really had the spark , would do so no matter what the handicap . As I grow older I am more and more of the opinion that the human race improves from inside influences and not from outside stimulation . And , - in any event , it improves slowly . The most recent plan  --  I 'm sorry that I can not identify it by date and hour , because it will probably have been changed before these words see print  --  is one calling for the employment of 534 men in a two-year forest-improvement program . They will be used to build trails through the forest land the Government is going to buy , to pick up dead branches , remove dead trees , cut out " weed trees , " and otherwise mess around in our already lovely forests . Let the Chips Fall Where They May T i I ESE men were to have been put to work on September first. , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of November and not only have the men not been put to work but the Government has bought no land of any consequence on which they could work . Since this plan was started , President Roosevelt is said to have ordered , first , a 20 per cent reduction and then a 50 per cent reduction in the whole plan . What he may order tomorrow , no one can guess . During I he past eight months , the various forest proposals have resulted in one definite thing  --  that is , the heaviest cutting of timber that our locality has ever seen . Landowners worked all winter , they are still working , to market every tree big enough to make a crosstie . A steady stream of ties and saw logs has headed out of the hills . More timber has been cut in my own neighborhood than has been cut in the ten previous years combined . Much of this timber , of course , has been marketed at a loss ; first , because there was such a dumping on the local markets that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; second , because many trees were cu t too young . Had they ' been left only a few more years , they would have been large enough to make really profitable logs . It must be borne in mind , too , that practically all of the hill country has been cut over , not once , but many times . That is a point that the young , recently graduated forestry students do not seem to realize . In our hill country , trees are a crop just as corn is a crop . The young foresters seem to feel that unless they can get their experimental hands upon a large acreage of American woodland , we face a serious shortage in the future . Nothing could be farther from the truth . If we had only the woodland of the Eastern United States , and kept the fire out of it , the probabilities are that we could grow a permanent supply of wood for American industry . It is perfectly silly to think that a tree will grow any faster when owned by the Government than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are that way . They will grow just as fast for you as for me . Among the land buyers there seem to be two schools of thought in regard to the bought-out population . One seems to feel that it is no concern of the Government what happens . The other feels that the population should be rehabilitated in some fashion . A few years ago the state bought the Morgan-Monroe State Forest , a few miles west of my place and in Monroe County . Today , half of the bought-out population is " supporting the courthouse " ? which is the Monroe County way of saying that they loaf in the basement and collect their periodical baskets when they fee/ the pinch of hunger . This whole forest-buying program is a complicated mass of contradictory ideas , of impractical , amateurish notions . It is unsound , if for no other reason , because it is a fantasy ? " a form of representation that brings before the mind images as such , severed from their ordinary relations . " Brown County is not a wheat-growing community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they found other crops more profitable . In this they were some two decades ahead of the so-called better farming sections of the state . It is doubtful if there are many Indiana farms that can produce wheat in competition with the huge grain acreage of the West , where machines do the work we must do by hand . The Agricultural-joker AT NO time during the past ten years has Brown County produced as much as 500 acres of wheat . When the New Dealers told us how much wheat we could plant , we were surprised to discover that our county was " limited " to 3800 acres  --  nearly eight times as much as she had grown in any one year for a decade . The corn-hog-reduction contracts were a deliberately planned effort to bring American agriculture under the absolute dictation of the Secretary of Agriculture . Item 9 of the first section of this contract contains the joker . Few farmers who signed the contract ever read that item . It reads : " 9 . The signer agrees to Conform to and abide by regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the terms of this offer and of this contract ) heretofore or hereafter prescribed by the Secretary or his authorized agents or agencies relating to Corn-Hog Reduction Contracts . " In plain English , the signers bind themselves to abide by any rulings or regulations that the Secretary may make at any time . Proponents of the Administration will at once say that I am trying to make a mountain out of a molehill and that in actual practice that clause would not be used  --  that it was inserted merely for the protection of the Government . Our county agent , R. E. Grubbs , of Nashville , Indiana , informs me that to date the Secretary has invoked that clause on a number of occasions . So far there have been eighty-six ( 86 ) " regulations and administrative rulings " by which the original signers are bound . One of my neighbors , Fred Fleener , owns an excellent farm . He grows corn and hogs and has several fine Jersey cows . He signed a corn-hog contract . Later in the year he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to buy a few more cows . He was told that he could not do that under the terms of his contract . After reading the contract again , carefully , he was unable to find any mention of cows , and he protested to the enforcement officials . He then learned that cows had crept into the contract through that break in the fence known as Item 9 . The **26;882;TOOLONG contracts in Brown County have so far been subjected to only forty-two ( 42 ) regulations and administrative rulings . Laws relating to contracts go back a very great distance in the world 's history . The fundamentals are pretty well established . One of these fundamentals of contract law states : " If an offer contains on its face the terms of a complete contract , the acceptor will not he bound by any other terms intended to be included in it ; unless it appear that he knew of those terms and was capable of informing himself of their nature . " ( Knowlton Law of Contracts . ) In the summer of 1934 I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all sugar that I had in stock and on all that I had in the form of manufactured jams , jellies , apple butter , and so on . I ignored the first notice and was given a second warning . Then I explained that the only sugar I owned was something less than ten pounds in the home pantry . I offered to pay the tax on this , but I heard no more from the collector . At the same time , our local storekeepers were required to weigh all the cotton piece goods they had on their shelves and contribute so much per pound to the cotton-processing tax . The tax collectors of the New Deal had long arms . The various farm contracts were merely one way in which the Department of Agriculture was trying to regiment all rural industry . A tremendous bureaucracy was being built up that would  --  and does  --  affect the life of every citizen , whether he lives on a farm or not . With our canning factory we were able to know about some of these amazing rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , we pack apple butter in quart glass jars . Apple butter , being heavier than water , weighs approximately thirty-eight ounces to the quart , and the labels have been printed with that statement of contents for many years . We were notified that our apple-butter label was illegal because it failed to " state the contents of the jar in terms of the largest possible unit . " We were told that we would have to change our labels to read either " One Quart " or " Two Pounds Six Ounces . " It seemed simpler to its to use the term " One Quart , " and we accordingly had our labels printed with that declaration of content . Tempest in a jam Pot I N THE meantime we sold a lot of apple butter to the poor-relief agencies in Indianapolis and delivered it .. After it was in the city , the relief agency complained that it was not . according to the contract . They had ordered " thirty-eight ounce " jars and we had supplied " quart " jars . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple butter weigh thirty-eight ounces . However , in order to get our goods accepted , I had to send a crew of three men to the city , and for nearly a week they opened cases and rubber-stamped each jar with the words " Contents 38 Ounces . " The Department of Agriculture was responsible for having passed the MeNary-Mapes Law , which gives the Secretary authority to prescribe standards for canned goods . The standard prescribed for canned peaches practically prevents me from packing this fruit . Very few varieties of Eastern peaches are satisfactory as canned products . Most of them have a tendency to " rag " and to be too soft . One variety , however , is very satisfactory and makes a distinctive product that excels any canned peaches I know . This variety is called Michigan Gold Drop . It is a very small peach , but has good color and a marvelous flavor , when properly canned . The McNary-Mapes standard for canned peaches specifies that each half peach in a can shall weigh a certain amount  --  about twice what the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can not pack Gold Drop peaches . We could go ahead and pack our small peaches anyhow , but we would have to label the cans in large letters : BELOW U. S. STANDARD , BUT NOT UNFIT FOR FOOD . Canners refer to this as the " hog-feed label . " Trifling incidents in the New Deal , you may say . Certainly they are trifling incidents . Life and government are made up of trifling incidents ; it is the nature of the incidents that determines whether the life or the government is good or bad . In 1934 , Secretary Wallace published a little book entitled America Must Choose . No one can read that book without ( Continued on Page 90 ) ( Continued from Page 88 ) We sent flowers to our friend in the hospital ; and when we went to condole with him , we found that he had laid out his bankbook in a little white Pasteboard box and our flowers were appropriately arranged around it for the financial funeral . Which reminds me of one of Hollywood 's amenities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . If you are willing to pay out six or eight dollars a week , there are people who will undertake to keep your house full of flowers . They will not only deliver them daily but will arrange them tastefully and attractively for you . It sounds tempting . I know I fell for it . There are hothouse plants out here too . Movie agents fall into that category . Like the well-known lily of the field , they toil not , neither do they spin , yet Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like one of these . Fortunately for Bob , he has never been in a spot which forced him to use an agent . But there are a lot of things waiting around the corner for us along with prosperity , and one of them may be an agent . His fee will be 10 per cent of Bob 's salary if , as and when he comes into our life . And that goes for better or for worse . If Bob does n't like his agent when he has hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob can go out and get another agent and pay the new one 10 per cent of his take , but the 10 per cent will keep on going out ? to the one he has fired , too , as long as the job Mats that the fired one had landed for him . I know men who have as many as three agents , one active and two inactive , except on pay day . Exacting Guests Our parties at home fall into two general classifications . Small parties for six or eight , or big parties for forty or fifty . The larger parties cost from two hundred dollars up . You ca n't expect your regular staff of servants to handle them for you . So you get in a caterer and turn him loose . I get away with from four to six parties of this kind a year , but our obligations are piling up on us , and Bob thinks we should entertain more than we do . Bob 's liquor bill averages seventy-five dollars a month , and that figure is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , it is quite a bit more than seventy-five a month , now that repeal has made it possible to get vintage wines and imported beers . He finds that his friends and guests are pretty particular about the brands they drink . Julian Street 's book on wines is to Hollywood what the Hagerstown Almanac was to my grandfather . realizing that Wallace is an idealist . No farmer can read the book without wondering how he got that way . Wallace , with his farm background , should be a practical man . He should understand farming . He should know at least a little about human nature . Of course , a practical farmer may at the same time be an idealist , but not quite so violently idealistic as is Henry . And your guests do n't hesitate to complain if they feel that your cellar is below par . But fun away from home is expensive too . There are all sorts of inexpensive places I am crazy to try out , but somehow we always end up at Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and it 's imperative for you to be with them . Every week end seems to cost us about fifty dollars , no matter where we go or what we do . At least I know that Bob cashes a check for that much every Saturday noon at the studio cashier 's window , and it 's all gone by Monday . Summer cottages at Malibu or other beaches are very expensive . And even at sky-high rentals , there are not many attractive ones to be had . Most of our friends prefer to join beach clubs . Which means that you buy a fivehundred-dollar bond and pay dues in addition . The dues do not include food and drink . If you feel very swanky and want a family cabana at one of the clubs for the summer , you must go down into your jeans and come up with six hundred dollars . After a summer or two of this nonsense , we thought it would be cheaper to rent a house with a tennis court , but the resultant week-end congestion , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive than the club idea . Occasional trips East for both Bob and myself I regard as necessary expenses . I mean jaunts in addition to Bob 's annual trips hack to see the theater openings , which are paid for by the studio . Bob works on these trips and does n't really get away from California mentally at all . I mean the trips we take either together or alone at other times . It is absolutely necessary for the peace of mind and mental well-being of an Easterner transplanted into the California climate to receive an annual or semiannual assurance in person that somewhere the seasons actually change , that snow flies and rain beats in faces and the air is capable of a cold crispness . There is also the feeling summed up in the oft derided but none the less real desire " to get away from it all . " To sit in a room with friends whose sole topic of conversation is not eternally and monotonously pictures , scripts , casting and studio gossip . Some of our picture friends who have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun at us for feeling that way about it . To them , such trips are extravagances . And they are sure that our flittings are neatly camouflaged journeys to sample the fleshpots and bright lights . One of our friends who happened to be in the East when we were there on ow ' last trip came hack to the Coast to report : " Bob and his wife ca n't be in New Here is the most significant sentence in the book ( from page 22 ) : " Enduring social transformation such as our New Deal seeks is impossible of realization without changed human hearts . " The pathos of that statement is well-nigh heartbreaking . Two thousand years ago , a man came out of Nazareth preaching something of the sort . He sought a change in the hearts of men York . I asked to see the register at the Waldorf , and they were n't listed there . " It was on one of those escape trips East that Bob and I woke up to the realization that we were playing a game of put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking Thought for Tomorrow We figured that the best way to save was to obligate yourself to save , so that you have to lay aside something whether you like it or not , come hell or high taxes . We bought a house . It is beginning to work already . We needed four thousand cash to swing the deal , and we saved it in six months . I do n't know bow , but we did . Having thus found out that it can be done , I managed to save five hundred out of my " egg " money for a trip East , and Bob has bought a few thousand-dollar annuity bonds . Then , after we have remodeled the house we have bought , and saved the money to pay for the alterations , and after we have made the last payment on the place and it is no longer our little white house in the red , we will have something tangible to show for our pains . Something that we can walk up to and touch and feel and use . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to , or send up rockets to Mars if we feel like it . Those who sit down at long last and take stock , as we are doing now , usually end by placing their salaries in the hands of business managers , who give them just so much to live on and invest the rest of it ? in gilt-edge securities and annuity bonds . Lots of the stars who have snapped out of it while their earning capacity was still potent are putting their money into little ' business enterprises such as dress shops , orange groves , hairdressing parlors and interior-decoration projects . Bill Haines , for example , is resting easily with a thriving antique and decorating business for a pillow . Randy Scott and Cary Grant run a gentleMen 's haberdashery ; Esther Ralston , a beauty parlor ; and Charles Ruggles raises oranges and chickens on his ranch . We are not quite in the class of those who hire men to help them keep their incomes or invest their surpluses in small business enterprises . But we have taken steps . Feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right direction . Maybe after a while we will even get around to saving half of half of what we thought we were going to save . The sooner you can bring yourself to think in terms of " How long will this last ' ? " instead of " How long has this been going on ? " the better . You are fortunate if you do n't wake up too late to do something about it . and gave his life in an effort to bring about such a change . He preached peace and good will . For 2000 years followers of that man have gone up and down the earth carrying those teachings to every nook and corner of the globe . In 1914 , men who had been bred for generations under the teachings of that Nazarene started the most ( Continued on Pope 92 ) Vaseline ' Hair Tonic into your scalp to replace those that are deficient , to correct dryness , combat dandruff and thoroughly cleanse the pores .

( Continued from Pogo 92 ) Early in 1934 the CWA authorities approved a project to build a gymnasium at our local high school in the village of Helmsburg . Alfred Grindle , a noted architect who has built many beautiful churches , schools and homes all over the Midwest , drew the plans . He estimated that the job would cost not to exceed $10,000 . Through the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged on . Only men " on relief " could be employed . Spring came again and the building was still unfinished . In November , 1935 , that gymnasium was still unfinished  --  after more than twenty months ' work . Any competent contractor could have completed the job in four months , and perhaps in three . The estimated cost has long been exceeded . In the early summer of 1935 one of the county work directors told me that at that time the cost had amounted to about three times the original estimate . Ultimately , I suppose , it will be completed and we shall have a ten-thousand-dollar gym at a cost to the taxpayers of probably forty thousand dollars . At the same time , work was started on a landing field near the governor 's summer home , which the state maintains in the Brown County Park . To date , this landing field has cost more than $45,000 and no buildings have been erected . It is just one of those things that only a New Dealer could think up . During the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brown County . They were said to be efforts to prevent flood damage , and the Administration worked on the theory that if it could assist the water to get into the streams , it would all quickly run away and there would be no flood . Aquatic Boondoggling Gangs of men were sent out to chop all the trees and brush away from the banks of the little rivers , They actually reduced one stretch of Bean blossom Creek to the status of a canal . All the graceful red birches , all the sycamores and willows , were cut to the ground . The banks were grubbed where bushes grew and an unsightly picture produced where before had been grace and beauty . I own a stretch of Beanblossom Creek , a lovely stretch , overhung with drooping birches and the evergreen boughs of hemlock . I sent word to the stream-improvement foreman that if he or his men set foot on my ground , they would have to suffer the consequences . However , before they reached my property , the NOW Dealers were chasing some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Dealers wanted to do something about our streams . This time , however , they had a new idea . They still wish to prevent floods , but they now think the way to do it is to build dams in the streams . Accordingly , plans have been made to build dams not only in Brown County but all over Indiana , and probably other states as well . And let it be understood , this dam project is not a liking project , as some of the others have been . They do not propose to build just a few dams ; they plan to build hundreds of them . First they clear the streams of obstructions . Then they build dams . Both projects are flood-control measures . Perhaps you can understand it . I ca n't . All of this work , of course , was in the nature of made work  --  desirable ( ? ) things to do for the community , but not things that were imperative and , in the natural course of events , would probably not he done at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep men at work than to put them on a dole or to give them direct relief . Uninvited Guests The men who cleared the streams were paid fifty cents an hour . Many of them were never paid more than twenty cents an hour in their lives and some were not worth half that sum . Comparatively few of our native population were on the relief rolls . This was illustrated by the conditions in Hamblen Township , where ninety-two families were receiving help , and eighty-seven of them had moved into the county in the past three years . In other words , five native Brown County families had to be cared for . The others were " foreigners . " These " foreigners " were people who had moved to Brown County to " ride out the depression . " They had heard that it was easy to make a living here , and simply moved in and occupied any old building they could find  --  and in Hamblen Township were many abandoned farms . We had a few such newcomers in my own neighborhood , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " back of beyond , " where thriftier people had found it hard going on rough land . One morning as I was driving down to the village for my mail , I picked up a man who was a stranger to me . He told me that he lived over in a rough part of the county northwest of Hickory Hill and that he was formerly a workman in an automobile factory in Detroit . Like many others , he was riding out the depression . When he first came to the hills he had a little money and made a down payment on the rough hill farm where he hoped to make a living . His case was desperate from the very start , because he was unskilled in farming and had a poor piece of ground to begin with . As we rode along , he asked if I knew of a canning factory anywhere in the neighborhood . I told him that I owned the only canning plant in the county . " That . most be the factory the land buyers are talking about , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about it ? " I inquired . " Well , " he answered , " they told me that if I would sign up my land , they would move me down close to the factory and give me a job there . " That , of course , was interesting to me , and 1 could not help wondering if they would inform me before they hired my help . I followed this man 's case with considerable interest . He finally did " sign up " his land , and the mitts who held the mortgage on it was paid in full . This left the workman a balance due him amounting to something like $300 . However , they did not give him this money in cash . Instead , they gave him a grocery credit at a local store and allowed him to eat week . However , worth of his own money each However , the New Deal was looking after this workman very well .
