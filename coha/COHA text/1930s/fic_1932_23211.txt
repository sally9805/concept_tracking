THE HONEY POT A STORY BY CHARLES CALDWELL DOBIE T HE other evening when I climbed up the front steps to my lodgings , I saw that my landlady had taken down the sign from the window that told of the room which was to let . This made me very happy , for it had been six months since anyone had lodged there . And I began to wonder about the new lodger . I thought , " Is the new lodger a man or a woman ? " But , once I had opened the door , I knew that a woman had come to live in the room next to me . For even in the front hall there was the fragrance of perfume . I went up to my room . The perfume grew stronger . It was thick and heavy , like the smell of a summer garden at night . It was a gentle perfume , like the scent of violets that used to blossom in a shady bed at the monastery near Prague where I learned to be a baker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lodge next me would be like . And I listened for her footsteps or for the sound of noises that people make when they go bustling about the matter of a new lodging . But everything was still . Instead of her footsteps , I heard the voice of my landlady , welcoming somebody , and a great tramping up the stairs . And I remembered that I had asked my friends to come and have a game of cards with me . I opened my door and they came in laughing  --  my Greek friend who works beside me at the bakery , a Russian , whom I had met in a restaurant run by a woman from the Volga district ; and behind them a youth from my native village of Polna . I opened the door and they came in laughing , all except my young countryman . A strange look was on his face , and his eyes were the eyes of a man who had seen a ghost pass . I said to him : " Come , what is your trouble ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking like one bitten by a chill wind . He sat down . I turned to the others who were laughing . " What is this ? " I said sharply . " Can you laugh with a comrade in this distress ? " " Distress ! Distress ! " called out the Russian . " He was as gay as any when your landlady opened the door upon us . " " There is a strange perfume in the hall , " said my countryman . And he put his hand upon his forehead . " Oh , ho  --  perfume ! " cried my Greek friend . " What sort of man are you to grow giddy over a strong scent ? I thought that a woman 's trick . " " Hush ! " said the Russian . " It is probably not the perfume at all . But something the perfume calls to mind . . . . " I nodded my head . " It was so when my sister died . The apple trees before my father 's house were filled with blossoms . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of my little sister lying in a cold , dark room with candles fluttering like yellow moths about her head . " " Music is like that , too , " said the Russian . " You hear a strain of music on a summer day and ever after when it is played you see youths and maidens dancing between the lilac bushes , and haycocks golden in the sun , and swallows darting in and out of the shadows . " My countryman gave a sigh . " You are right , " he said . At this my Greek friend laughed . " I will wager that nothing so innocent as candles before a corpse or dancing between lilac bushes is in our young friend 's mind at this moment . . . . If ever I smelled a wanton smell it was to-night when your landlady opened the door upon us . " The Russian drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly . He shook his head . " It certainly is not a chaste scent , " he admitted . " Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What manner of woman did you fall in love with ? To have such memories at your age is monstrous ! " My countryman sighed . " She was very beautiful , " he said . " How old were you ? " asked the Russian . " Six  --  perhaps seven . " " In love  --  at seven ! " cried my Greek friend . " Whoever heard of such non-sense ! " " That is not nonsense , " replied the Russian . " One is always in love  --  from the moment one 's eyes begin to see things . Come , did you not cry with longing from the very beginning ? For a bright red apple your grandmother held up to you . Or a new rattle . Or a piece of sugar wrapped in a cloth ? " " That is not love . I wanted only to possess them . " " That is all love is , " returned the Russian . " It is the same at seven or seventy . " At this my young countryman looked up at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said slowly . My Greek friend laughed outright . " So ! You have seen a beautiful woman while you slept . That is nothing new . " " How dull you are ! " cried the Russian . " As if dreams are always a matter of couch and pillow . Wideeyed dreams are the most disturb-ing ? , " Yes , that is it ! " exclaimed my countryman . " That is the word  --  disturbing . " With that I heard the door of the next room open . The three of us listened . The door closed . The new lodger went down the hall . There came the tread of feet on the stairway , the bang of the front door . The four of us drew in our breaths . A scent drifted through the cracks of the door . And again I thought of a summer garden at night  --  only this time it was as if a hot wind had blown over it . My companions looked at me . The eyes of the youth from Polna were burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She has gone out . " My Greek friend sneered . " On the streets where she belongs . " The youth from Polna gave a little shiver . " It is the same scent . Yes , it is the same scent . I wonder ? " " What is he talking about ! " exclaimed my Greek friend . " His dream , of course , " said the Russian . " Tell us about it . " My countryman took a gay handkerchief from his pocket . " Very well , " he answered . " But you will laugh at me . " I looked at my Greek friend . " Not all of us , " I said . My countryman began to tell his story but almost at once he grew confused and stopped . " It is simple enough when I think of it , " he said . " But to tell it is another story . For one thing , I do not know where to begin . " " I can tell you that , " said my Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is always where the writers of romances start . " " Do you want to keep us here all night ? " cried the Russian with a dry laugh . " He was born in Polna , " I put in , " ? near Prague . " My countryman shook his head . " You are wrong , Josef Vitek . The village where I was born was not so grand as Polna . My father and mother moved there later , when I was ten years old . " " After your dream , " said the Russian . " After my dream . . . . At that time , we lived in a little village that you would not even know by name . My parents were poor , the village was poor , the country round about it was poor . It was in the mountain districts , and my father was a woodcutter . " The Russian smiled and nodded his head . " Once upon a time there lived a poor woodcutter . This begins like a fairy tale . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave man . And my mother was grave , too . Folk who live in the mountains are never as gay and happy as those who live in the lowlands . One spring a great company of men moved up from the plains . They made a camp not far from the village . They were a gay lot . In the evenings I could hear their music and laughter . And sometimes , when the air was very still , the echo of their dancing feet fell upon my ears . " " Ah , gipsies 1 " cried my Greek friend . The youth from Polna shook his head . " No . They were workmen . Laborers , sent up by rich men to dam up a stream for the making of electricity . I knew nothing of the wonders of what these men purposed , then . Nor did my parents . For they were not only grave but simple . Nor did I care . Their music and laughter and dancing feet were enough for me . But spring departed and summer came and still all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at nightfall . " " What has all this to do with a woman ? " asked my Greek friend sourly . " Be silent ! " said the Russian . " The first days of summer found my father a busy man , " went on my countryman . " There were trees to fell and logs to hew for the damming of the stream . Every day he rose at sunrise and went into the forest . And every day I begged him to take me , so that I might see these men who danced so gaily and sang at nightfall . But at the moment when he seemed persuaded my mother would say , ' It is not safe for the child to go among strangers . ' At which my father would laugh , and reply , ' Do you fancy that these plainsmen are demons ? ' And he would depart with his gleaming ax on his shoulder , leaving me weeping . Or he would say sourly , ' The child must leave your knee some day . ' To which she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not risk him before his time . ' " The Russian turned to my Greek friend . " Did I not say that love was possession ? " " One day , in the late afternoon , a pedlar came to our door with a pack of finery on his back . My mother liked the ribbons and the bright kerchiefs and the velvet girdles embroidered with roses . She had no money to spend , yet she fingered and stroked everything as if she had somewhere a bag of gold hidden . While she looked and bargained for trinkets she could not buy , I strolled away from the doorstep . I heard the sound of ruy father 's ax in the distance and the cries of the workmen stopping the river 's flow , and the pounding of hammers . I looked back at my mother . She had forgotten me . .. . She had forgotten me , and my feet were before the road that led into the forest . I began to run . I felt free and happy . " My countryman cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? not even my Greek friend who always had a jibe on the tip of his tongue . " I ran and ran , " went on my countryman . " I came to a bridge leaping over a chasm . Not a bridge of stone or even stout timbers but a bridge flung together quickly  --  a bridge which swung even in the light breeze . I stopped . For the first time I trembled . I thought of my mother bending over the pedlar 's sack  --  my mother who had forgotten me . I stepped on the bridge . It swayed , and my heart beat in my throat . But I kept on . Far below in a hollow of the mountain , I saw men swarming like ants over the hillside . " I crawled down toward them . I found a sunny spot upon a knoll and here I sat watching , watching . Never before had I seen such a sight . Hundreds of men with their backs bent in toil ; great engines that ate into the hillside and spewed forth what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen but set themselves in motion . it was a warm day but presently a cold wind began to blow . The brown bodies of the men no longer gleamed in the sunlight . I knew that the day was spent and I began to think of home . I pulled myself up the hillside again and stood once more before the bridge . But the thing I had done in the light of day I coubd not persuade myself to accomplish in the pale twilight . Besides , the wind had risen sharply and the bridge was swinging like a grapevine . The songs of the birds were hushed and the cries of wild beasts began to float toward me . But , above everything else , I heard my name , echoing up and down the mountain side , and I knew that my father was calling me . I listened . My father 's voice came again . I wanted to cry out in answer . I longed to feel my hand in the strong hand of my father . But , instead , I put my fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind man but at that moment I feared him . I feared him at that moment more than the gloom of the forest or the cries of the wild beasts . " I ran along a path that fell away from the bridge . It led along the hillside and then dropped gently down into a gloomy fold in the hills . I saw the light of bonfires through the pine boughs and I came upon a but or two perched above their crackle and flame . The door of the first but was open . I peered in . A woman sat before a table with the light of a candle turned full upon her face . " " Ah , " cried my Greek friend , rubbing his palms together . " At last we have come to the woman . " My countryman paid no heed to these words . " She was dressed in red like a flame , " he went on . " And she sat there , waiting . I have seen my mother sit thus in the twilight , waiting for my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad look upon the faces of women who wait thus . When she saw me she drew back but the next moment she flung wide her arms to me and I ran forward and threw myself upon her breast , weeping . Her body was warm and sweet-smelling , and the hands that wiped my tears away were soft and white . I looked up at her . She was like no woman I had ever seen . " My mother 's hands were rough from toil , my mother 's hair was dull and faded , my mother 's lips were thin and pale . But this woman had smooth fingers and shining hair and full , red lips . But it was her fragrance that beguiled me -- it was her fragrance that was a curtain that shut out the world and made me forget to be fearful of my father 's anxious voice calling to me up and down the hillside . It was her fragrance that made me forget my mother 's tired breast which had been so eager to shelter me . " " It is always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born an enchantress . " " I ceased my crying and she put me down . She moved toward the door , and I felt a great fear lest she might walk out into the night and melt away . Instead , she closed the door and bolted it fast . Then she went to a cupboard and took out bread and a pitcher of goat 's milk and a pot of honey and sweetmeats and laid them on a table . " She drew up a stool and sat me before a deep bowl and presently I was feasting . Now , thought I , she will begin to question me . But all she said was , ' Have you no taste for honey ? ' And she smiled and held out a spoon dripping sweetness to my greedy lips . Then she put a bit of plum cake before me and I knew that she was not mortal ? since no mortal woman would feed me honey and plum cake at one meal . For a moment I was frightened , remembering a story my mother had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetmeats , only , in the end , to devour them . I drew back , but she smiled and held the plum cake up to me . I took it from her and devoured it to the last crumb . " " A child and a man , " said the Russian " ? they are all one . When a woman smiles at them they forget danger . " " As I was finishing my plum cake , there came a loud rapping on the door . I started up in terror for 1 thought that my father had come for me . Hush , ' she said , ' it is nothing ! ' Then she went to the door and cried , ' Can not you see that my door is closed ? Go away ! ' And I heard a strange voice grumble and fade into the distance . " After that another man came and beat upon her door  --  and another , and yet another . But to every one she gave the same reply . I sat at the table watching every move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room swam before me . I felt myself lifted up and laid upon a bed so soft that it seemed cushioned with lamb 's wool . " I awoke to a black terror . Thunder was crashing overhead , and a tempest sang through the trees . I gave a cry . But at once I felt myself enveloped in a fragrant warmth . I remembered the woman in the flame-colored dress and the plum cake and honey she had fed me . And I knew that I was safe in her arms , and then I slept until morning . " " And did you never think once of your home ? " I asked suddenly . " Did you never think once of your father 's frantic cries or your mother 's tears ? " My countryman shook his head . " Only as something that belonged to a time that was past . " " She was a witch ! " grumbled my Greek friend . " As such women always are , " said the Russian . " When I awoke , her door was open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the huge bed gazing up at the rafters . The woman was laying more bread and milk upon her table  --  in the center was the honey pot . A strange sadness seized me and I began to weep . She came over and kissed me . ' What is it , little one ? ' she said . I shook my head . ' Are you grieving for your mother ? Come , now that it is morning you shall tell me where you live and we shall go back together . But I only wept more loudly . ' What is it , little one ? ' she said once more . ' I shall never see you again , ' I answered . And at that she wept , also , holding me close . " I sat before the table , but even the honey did not tempt me . Finally she pressed me to her heart again , and we left her gay room and began to climb up the hillside . We climbed up and up until we came to the swaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the next moment she had gathered me in her arms and we stood safe upon the other side . " As we drew near my father 's house I saw his ax standing before the door and I knew that he had not gone to his task . We walked slowly up the little path . My father 's door was open and there came the sound of a woman weeping . Call to them , ' said the woman . I called my mother 's name . The weeping ceased . ' Call again , ' said my companion . But at that moment ray mother appeared in the doorway . " Her eyes fell upon me and she sprang forward . I felt myself gathered into an angry embrace . The next moment I was in my father 's house again , with the door shut swiftly in the face of the woman who had given me shelter . " My Greek friend began to laugh . " So that is all there is to your fine tale ! . . I thought you were to be stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had hopes , even , that your mother was never to see you again . " " It would have been as well , " said my countryman . " For , from the moment that she shut the door on the face of the woman who had given me shelter , my mother no longer possessed me . From that moment , I no longer loved her . " " She had lost you before that , " said the Russian . " She had lost you when your lips first tasted of the honey pot . " " My mother questioned me , " went on my countryman . " My father questioned me . But I would tell them nothing . My father even threatened to beat me , but my mother came between us and said cunningly , ' Let him alone . He will talk when the time comes . When the time comes he will weary us with his chatter about this painted creature and the evil things he saw in her house . ' But as the days went on and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity and spite . She threatened me , she coaxed me , she showered me with caresses  --  she even beat me . But I would not speak . I would not share my secret with her . Every night I cried myself to sleep . Every night I fell asleep and dreamed of the soft bed that once had been my portion . I fell asleep and smelled perfume and feasted on plum cake and honey . " And day by day nay mother grew more bitter and full of spite . And day by day I grew more silent and hateful until finally I said to myself , ' Why do you not run away ? Why do you not go and live forever with the woman who once sheltered you ? Why do you not go and feast forever on plum cake and honey ? ' So on the next morning , I ran from my father 's house once more . I went across the swaying bridge and down the steep mountain path . But the door that once stood open to me was closed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my father 's house . My mother was standing in the doorway . She had a willow switch in her hand . I did not even run from her . " The next day I said to my father , Take me with you into the forest . ' My mother smiled a bitter smile but she said nothing . So I went hand in hand away into the forest with my father , " My countryman ceased speaking . We were all silent . A great sadness had fallen upon us . I heard the slam of the front door . " What is that ? " said my Greek friend . " She has come back , " answered the Russian . Her tread was as heavy as the per-fume which drifted toward us as she passed to her door . My countryman grew pale again . " What folly ! " cried my Greek friend pointing to him . " Be silent ! " said the Russian . " Have you never had a memory that stabs at your heart ? " " I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps for days , for months , for a year . And then , quite suddenly , it comes to life again . I see a woman waiting in the twilight , or honey dripping from a spoon , or a slice of plum cake on a plate , and I say to myself , ' Some day I shall see her again . ' And a great longing to see this woman comes over me . But when I smell a rich perfume I am afraid . I think , ' Now she is at hand ! ' And I tremble all over . " " You long to see her and then you are afraid ! " cried my Greek friend . " I can not understand that . " The Russian scowled . " I understand perfectly . He is afraid because he is jealous of his memory . He wants to keep his beautiful memory even though it disturbs him . " My countryman nodded . " You must be right , " be said . " When that strange perfume passed this door I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead I sat here in my seat shivering . " " Come , " cried my Greek friend , " let us all go and beat upon her door ! When you see what she is like you will be cured . " " But this woman next door can not be the woman he is seeking , " I said . The Russian looked at me . " Can not ! " he exclaimed . My countryman shook his head . " I am afraid , " he murmured . Then he turned to me and said , " Josef Vitek , will you do me a favor ? Will you go beat upon her door and question her ? " " Yes , " I answered . " If that is your wish . " " She may not be alone , " laughed my Greek friend . I paid no heed to him . Instead , I found a package of cards and threw them on the table . " You three play at cards , " I said . " I shall not be long . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard was a coughing , coughing  --  for all the world like a parrot , mocking an old woman . I tapped lightly . The coughing ceased . " Who is there ? " a voice cried . A sudden whim seized me . " A countryman from Bohemia , " I said . There came a silence . Then the voice said , " Go away ! Go away ! " My heart beat quickly again . For I knew by her terror that I had guessed one thing concerning the woman on the other side of the door . " Let me in , " I begged . " I live in the next room . I am only a simple baker . I will not harm you . " There followed another silence . I heard a key turn in the lock and the door stood open . .. . The room was dim , but T saw a great mountain of flesh moving away from me . I followed into a circle of light , and the woman turned her face up to me . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " she said slowly , " I do not know you . I have never seen you before . " " You do not like your countrymen , " I said . " I do not like anybody who knew me when I was young . " As she said this she threw off a shawl that she had been wearing , and the air became thick with perfume . I looked about the room . In a corner was a table with a plate and a cup and saucer , and a loaf of bread on it . A tiny lamp stood in the center , and a little to one side was a jar of honey . I drew in a quick breath as one does who suddenly uncovers a secret and I said : " They tell me you were very beauti-ful ? " She gave a short laugh . " Young man , that is not a pretty speech . Still , it is so . And who told you all this nonsense ? " " I heard it from a child who has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do children know of such things ? " " A child who fell in love with you . Perhaps you do not think that such a thing can happen ! " She sat down upon a couch , away from the cruel glare of light . Her bosom was bare and it seemed very white in the dimness . " A child who fell in love with me , " she repeated . " You are talking nonsense . You do not even know my name . " " That is true , " I said . " But neither did the child who fell in love with you . . . . He lived in the mountains of Bohemia . He came to your but one night and you fed him plum cakes and honey . " She sat for a moment motionless . Then she began to tremble and reach for her shawl . " I should not have opened the door ! " she cried . " Do not be afraid , " I said . " I am not that child . He sits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to see if his dream has come true . " " His dream ? " " He thinks always of you as the most beautiful vision of his life . . . . Whenever he sees a woman waiting in the twilight , whenever he sees honey dripping from a spoon , whenever he sees a piece of plum cake on a plate he says to himself , ' Someday I shall seeher again ! ' And a great longing comes over him . But when he smells a rich perfume he is afraid . He thinks , Now she is at hand ! ' And he trembles all over . " She took her hand from the shawl at her throat . Her words were almost the words that my Greek friend had uttered : " He longs to see me and yet he is afraid ? " I nodded . " To-night when this strange perfume passed my door he wanted to open it and see you for himself . But instead he sat in his seat , shivering . " She shook her head sadly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . . I , too , have longed to see the child again who brought me happiness for a night . But now that he sits across the hall , I , too , am afraid . I have my dream also . " I moved toward the door . " Shall I call him ? " She rose quickly . " No ! " she cried . " I shall not have him come here . I shall not have him come here to draw back from me . " " You have lived a hard life . " " An evil one . It is the same thing . " I moved toward the door . " Yet you have a good heart , " I said . " That is never enough , " she answered . " What shall I tell him ? " " Tell him that I am a fat old woman . That will suffice . " As she said this she buried her face in her hands , and I opened the door and left her alone , weeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . His lips were parted and his eyes were shining . But his cheeks were pale . " Well ? " he cried . I shook my head . " She is a fat old woman , " I answered . And I began to laugh . He sat down like a man who had been struck in the face . " Somehow , I thought that at last I had found her , " he muttered . The woman 's door opened and closed again . We all fell silent , listening to the tramp of her feet down the stairs . The perfume came again . " Open the window , " cried the Russian . " This room smells like a garden filled with dying flowers . " I crossed over and threw open the window . The woman was standing on the opposite side of the street under the glare of the lamp light . She had her drab shawl over her shoulders . " If you do not mind , Josef Vitek , " said my countryman , " I think I shall go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Greek friend who likes a bitter jest . My countryman rose without a word and left us . I stood by the window , watching . I saw my countryman go down the front stairs , I saw him cross thestreet . I saw the woman dart forward and then fall back , drawing her shawl up to her eyes . And I knew at once that she had guessed who had passed her . I went and sat at the table . " You were lying , Josef Vitek ! " said my Greek friend . " Anyone could tell that . " I turned to the Russian . " Should I have told him the truth ? " I demanded . The Russian shrugged his shoulders . " Why not ? " demanded my Greek friend . " People who know the truth have nothing left to dream about , " put in the Russian . " Which is best ? " I cried . " Which is best  --  the truth or the dream ? " The Russian shook his head . " If one knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he began to deal out the cards for a game .
