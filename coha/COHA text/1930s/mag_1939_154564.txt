In U. S. show business , most working performers belong to unions . The union which is supposed to take care of vaudevillians , night-club entertainers , circus performers and such is the imposingly-named American Federation of Actors . Like other entertainers ' unions , the A. F. A. is more or less tied to the apron strings of a mother , the Associated Actors and Artistes of America ( " Four A 's " ) . Watchful grandma is the American Federation of Labor . Last week in Manhattan , Mother Four A 's had A. F. A. with its pants down ready for a spanking . Grandma stood by . <P> When A. F. A. 's Executive Secretary Ralph Whitehead read in trade papers last winter that his union was incompetently and bossily run , he demanded that Four A 's either give him a lollipop or a licking . Four A 's , handing out no lollipops , investigated , last month issued eight charges against A. F. A. , cited it for trial last week . Some charges : that A. F. A. was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records from Four A 's investigators ; that it had used for administrative expenses $12,997 it had collected from benefits . <P> A. F. A. 's President Sophie Tucker , stout trouper who is widely regarded as a lovable prop executive , held an A. F. A. meeting to get a vote of confidence . Miss Tucker wept , a blonde bit another actor , there was a free-for-all and no vote of confidence . Last week as the A. F. A. trial opened , Miss Tucker , other executives and A. F. A. lawyers walked out on it , charging that it was packed and illegal . <P> When the A. F. A. members had departed , an accountant testified that the A. F. A. benefits had profited its out-of-work members nothing , cited other figures in an attempt to show that its financial methods were careless . Two swimmers , a dancer and a show girl from Billy Rose 's Aquacade at the New York World 's Fair , which the A. F. A. had been supposed to organize , vowed that A. F. A. had double-crossed them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Four A 's found the A. F. A. guilty on all but part of one count , revoked its charter . This birthright Four A 's thereupon presented to a new union , the American Guild of Variety Artists , with a constitution all written . Day later , the Guild was hard at work signing up A. F. A. members . A. F. A. executives declared they would go to court . Sophie Tucker said brittlely : " It is all very amusing . It is very funny . "
