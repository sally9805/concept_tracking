THE issue of government relief is destined to provoke a momentous battle in Congress . No one , of course , will demand cessation of all federal aid to the unemployed . But reaction , while genially prepared to tolerate older  --  and much cheaper  --  methods of benevolence , is determined to scuttle federal work relief . The future of the Works Progress Administration is at stake . Since its inception this agency has endured remorseless attack . Its critics endeavored from the first to present the unemployed as a shiftless , lazy , inept throng beaten in fair competition . " Boondoggling " was the inflammatory epithet for their activities that went echoing through the Union League Club . Newspaper photographs of men yawning luxuriously while leaning upon their shovels represented the subtleties of such criticism , the burden of which continues to be that WPA is wasteful , that its program is nourishing parasites , and that the nation can not profit from work relief . The fact is that in an atmosphere of distrust and humiliation WPA workers have fashioned a monumental record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites " could boast of 29,000 miles of new roads , 1,099 school buildings , 1,440 recreational centers , and 3,350 miles of new trunk and lateral sewers  --  a construction record which will be greatly augmented when the current inventory is completed . WPA has recaptured , out of the despair of depression , some of the daring and vitality usually identified with an era of expansion . This survey will neither evaluate the role of a work-relief program in stemming the economic crisis nor dwell upon WPA 's significance for the unemployed . It will concentrate on the record , for WPA deserves to be weighed in terms of the enduring service which the unemployed have rendered to the country . By March of this year 136,000 WPA projects had been put in operation . Approximately three-fourths of these ventures can be roughly defined as construction , the remainder being in the spheres of art , recreation , and research . Engaged in these far-flung enterprises at their peak were 3,840,000 people ; invested up to last March was $4,000,000,000 . What is the tangible return ? December 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic breakdown most communities of the United States in 1935 viewed new roads as an unthinkable luxury . Even modest improvement programs , hard enough to sustain in good times , had been abandoned . In little more than a year  --  from July , 1935 , to September , 1936 ? WPA completed 93,500 miles of road repairs in addition to the 29,000 miles of new construction . Sixty-one thousand miles of neglected dirt road , uncomfortable to the traveler and a deadly handicap to rural communities , were salvaged . WPA 's attack on these " farm-to-market " roads is a dramatic endeavor which will be memorable for generations . In 1935 Tennessee had more than 70,000 miles of county and community roads , only a small number of which had ever been adequately drained or surfaced . Although the state agreed to set aside part of the gasoline tax for road building , the average county could afford only $60 a mile for the work . In July , 1935 , WPA agreed to furnish labor and part of the materials for a large-scale program . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a road-improvement program designed to permit all-year , all-weather traffic , to open every mail and school bus route , and to link every farmhouse with its nearest market . In that interval more than 20,000 miles of rural roads were widened and repaired , including 3,000 miles of new grades . Hundreds of treated timber bridges were constructed , and several thousand untreated timber culverts and bridges were installed , clearing thousands of miles of right of way . Similar was the exploit in Monroe County , West Virginia , where it was discovered that the route from Rock Camp to Greenville was virtually impassable in severe weather ; even in good weather two cars could barely pass each other along this road , which provided the single means of egress for several hundred farms . It remained for WPA to end the blockade and to insure at least mail delivery under all conditions . In Oregon , thanks to WPA , Portland will soon have two new and valuable outlets to the sea . When the Wilson River and Wolf Creek projects are completed , the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming community , will have been reduced by more than thirty miles , and swift access will have been made possible to a rich timber area which was almost destroyed by fire in 1933 . Both highways attain a height of more than 1,200 feet above sea level , and along their routes are box-like canyons and hills demanding costly excavation and fill . But the work will bring fruitful returns in commerce , in recreation , and in the preservation of timber against devastating forest fires . The Lake Shore Boulevard project in Cleveland , to consider another example of WPA accomplishments in this sphere , will give that city a four-mile , non-stop highway connecting the heart of the business district with East Cleveland and enabling autoists to avoid miles of traffic-clogged streets . Parallel with the construction of the highway , elaborate park projects will transform the appearance of the area In New York 433 miles of highway had been repaired or improved by last July . In the whole country 46,000 road , street , and highway projects were under way by June 30 of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of American life are being altered . The rejected blueprints of decades are being turned into reality . Without WPA assistance they would still be gathering dust in neglected archives . PUBLIC BUILDINGS , EDUCATION , AND RECREATION During the early years of the depression many persons pointed with horror at America 's steadily dwindling educational facilities . Educators lamented the plight of remote communities where " universal education " received lip-service in ancient , cramped rooms which grimly resisted light , could not be adequately heated , and were topped with leaky roofs . Besides building more than 1,000 new school buildings from July , 1935 , to September , 1936 , WPA was responsible for renovations in 7,176 schools , accommodating nearly 3,000,000 pupils . Happy Valley , Tennessee , was a characteristic settlement in the Southern highlands with a schoolhouse where shivering children were taught not to expect too much . At a cost of only $3,000 WPA replaced the old building with a reasonably modern structure that is now the pride of the valley . In Danbury , Connecticut , the school committee wistfully agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a single , crowded frame building groaned from age and ill-treatment . No funds were available to remedy conditions . A new , well-equipped school now testifies to the " wastefulness " and " uselessness " of WPA . Happy Valley and Beaver Brook in 1935 were symbols of a grave problem about which masters ' theses were glumly written . In 1937 they typify the contribution of a federal works program to the nation 's welfare . At the end of last June 24,106 projects , costing $475,000,000 , were transforming America 's educational scene . Perhaps even more meaningful than WPA 's construction projects in the field of schooling is its nation-wide experiment in adult education . No more sweeping war on ignorance and illiteracy has ever been waged in the United States . Up to the end of last May more than 4 , - 000,000 students had attended classes in 600 different subjects , taught by 100,000 unemployed instructors . The teachers invaded rural communities , remote mountain valleys , and city slums , salvaging nearly 1,000,000 people from illiteracy . Workers ' education received unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program . Classes were even held at midnight to accommodate mill workers of the night shift . This phase of WPA activity gains in significance when viewed against the background of a democracy in which 32,000,000 people have received less than an eighth-grade education . Recognition must also be bestowed upon the intelligently managed forums which WPA has sponsored and which frequently have brought debate and an awareness of contemporary problems to areas in which free discussion had long been a shabby myth . These meetings have invariably been thronged . In a period of demagogic raids upon a distressed population the value of such sessions is obvious . The newest health center in the United States  --  the Carrie Tingley Hospital for Crippled Children at Hot Springs , New Mexico  --  was dedicated last May . The building , covering 1.8 acres of floor space , is constructed in Spanish colonial style and boasts the most modern facilities . It is a WPA project . On the crest of a Louisiana hill , settled amid pine trees , the G. B. Cooley sanitarium ministers to tuberculosis victims who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , forty-four-room building , and there can be no doubt that it meets an urgent community need . It was made possible by WPA . Throughout the country similarly needed public buildings can be attributed to WPA . Since 1913 , when Big Horn County , Montana , was separated from Yellowstone , its officials have been housed in rented office space . Now , after twenty-four years , they possess an imposing $95,000 native-stone county courthouse . At Ohio State University WPA workers are completing another section of the Tower Club , a low-cost , cooperative dormitory for selected students of limited means . An early national inventory disclosed that 155 new hospitals and similar social institutions had risen in underprivileged communities with WPA aid and that 870 old structures had been renovated or rebuilt . In the wake of every " crime wave " there is an outcry against America 's poverty in recreational facilities , yet local indigency rarely fails to block any significant construction . It took WPA just one year to remodel more than 3,000 recreational centers , while 1,440 entirely new edifices were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its service to national health and morale is incalculable . Jones County , Georgia , to take a typical situation , contained about 8,000 people , living in farmhouses sprawled throughout a broad area . Community life was barren ; recreation implied a difficult expedition to the city . Now a 115-acre tract of rolling woodland is being converted into a public recreation center , with a seven-acre artificial lake , community house , athletic fields , and picnic grounds . In Collingswood , New Jersey , a dangerous " old swimming hole " has become a 1,200,000-gallon pool , accommodating many bathers . A new public golf course has been opened in Washoe County , Nevada . In 1933 there were 164 playgrounds in New York City ; today there are 313 . For all of which , chief thanks is due to WPA . The most startling advance in provision of recreation , however , is registered in gymnasium construction . The new buildings which have sprung up throughout the country with the help of WPA funds and labor usually combine athletic space with auditorium facilities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating in intramural sports for the first time in their lives ; and adults who ca n't afford to be clubmen have a refuge for meetings and cultural activity . When the ancient gymnasium in Fossil , Oregon , was condemned , the inhabitants were deprived of their lone recreation hall ; WPA helped to replace it . In the state of Indiana such buildings are finished or under way in about fifteen cities . Four The NATION community centers and three gymnasiums are being constructed in West Virginia . This revolution in public recreation was doomed to generations of delay until WPA came to the rescue . BRIDGES AND AIRPORTS Until 1936 farmers of Highland County , Ohio , were traditionally compelled to ford Rattlesnake Creek with their horses and wagons ; automobiles , school buses , and mail trucks , unable to perform that feat , were forced to detour ten miles . A 160-foot steel span , which the locality had never been able to subsidize , now crosses Rattlesnake Creek . The wooden bridge at Jericho in Monroe County was creaking at the age of seventy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly too narrow for modern traffic . Throughout Ohio such relics are rapidly being replaced , and it is WPA that is doing the replacing . Last May Ohio officials reported that 9,295 bridges and culverts had been constructed through WPA funds . And the Ohio record merely typifies WPA accomplishments in this field throughout the nation . Through last June 940 WPA projects had been launched at 567 airport sites , resulting in the construction of new landing fields which cover 4,000 acres . More than 100 airport runways have been built and 500 municipal airports have been extended and improved . These projects were undertaken at a time when air traffic was reaching new proportions under acute , . often perilous limitations . Many of the country 's 2,500 landing fields were pleading for modernization when WPA began this work . Others were too small for traffic needs . In the first eleven months of 1935 Cleveland 's municipal airport handled 29,522 planes , an increase of 2,000 over the previous year . With space sharply limited , the possibility of disaster was serious . The city , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then WPA stepped in , extended the size of the port to 1,040 acres , and built a large asphalt landing , giving Cleveland perhaps the best equipped field in the country . Similar progress was recorded at the Newark airport . Dramatizing its emphasis upon safety in the air , WPA by last June had placed 7,701 signs and indicators along air-line routes . " PREVENTIVE " CONSTRUCTION In March , 1936 , flood damage in Haverhill , Massachusetts , was estimated at $1,550,000 . During the same month the major area of Lowell was miraculously saved from tragedy by " Francis ' Folly , " an old gate which barely stemmed the surging waters . Other territories have been less fortunate . For when the present is shadowed by depression , " preventive " enterprise is normally forgotten . But it need not be forgotten . Through the winter of 1937 WPA workers toiled at danger points in the Merrimac valley to safeguard populous centers from disastrous flood conditions . Frail barriers like the old Francis Gate were replaced . Whether present plans for protecting the Merrimac and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPA , for no other angels are in sight . December 18 , 1937 Elsewhere in the nation such projects have already reached notable dimensions . In thirteen months construction of new levees and embankments on rivers which habitually overflow their banks reached a total length of 107 miles . About 207 miles of old levees were strengthened and enlarged . Records reveal that Kansas is always in danger of receiving less rainfall than the crops require . WPA has made notable progress in a water-conservation scheme which may effectively ward off the drought danger . It was long recognized that lack of an adequate water supply threatened Birmingham 's industrial expansion . Now plans for a vast industrial water system are approaching reality through the joint efforts of WPA and PWA . Ley Creek sewer in New York State had imperiled the health of 10,000 people for a quarter of a century because of an unsanitary disposal system . With WPA aid this menace is being fought by installation of a more modern system . In this field the national program created in a single year 3,350 miles of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 1,155 sewage-disposal plants . Striving to combat malaria by extensive drainage , WPA has cleaned 492 miles of ditches in Virginia , affording protection to 150,000 people . In Hocking Valley , Ohio , a group of WPA workers was designated to combat a blazing fire in the heart of one of the richest coal fields in the world ? a fire had been burning continuously at New Straitsville for fifty-two years . Rat-extermination projects have frequently been lampooned by WPA 's critics , but in Chicago , where the Board of Health is sponsoring WPA effort along these lines , rats cause $7,000,000 damage to property every year . The activities of the WPA are indeed varied  --  more varied than this brief survey can show . Its workers ply houseboats on the Yazoo River in Mississippi in order to bring books to inaccessible , remote communities , serve hot lunches to school children , probe traffic disasters in a campaign to make the highways safe in Kentucky , and build new flax-processing plants in Oregon . A panorama view of the WPA adventure can not reveal its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can only suggest the breadth of the program and the imagination behind it . No partisan can pretend that all has been sweetness and light in the fulfilment of the projects . So sweeping an enterprise was doomed to suffer from bureaucracy and confusion . But the enemies of work relief do not protest primarily against flaws in execution . What they fear is the impact of a dynamic federal program which , without the stimulus of private profit , has nevertheless registered sober achievement . They cherish the notion that the unemployed are really unfit or unwilling to work . And above all , they recognize that work relief is both more costly and more ennobling than a niggardly dole . Through WPA the unemployed have redeemed the idea of work relief ; the " boondogglers " have made good . Their future is up to Congress . ( In the second section of this article , to be published next week , Mr. Wechsler will survey the record of WPA in the fine arts. )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
