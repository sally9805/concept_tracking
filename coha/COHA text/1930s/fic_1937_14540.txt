A dim room , in which the early light of September , coming through two windows in the right-hand wall , barely reveals two people in bed . The bed , which has no foot-board and is really a day-bed , stands at the center of the back wall with its head against the wall . Chairs with clothing on them are just visible . The window farthest from the bed is partly open . ARTHUR ( on the right of the bed , softly ) . Are you asleep ? SALLY ( loudly and distinctly ) . No . ARTHUR What are you thinking about ? SALLY My part . ARTHUR I thought you were . SALLY Give me a cigarette . ( He reaches for them on a table to the right of the bed , gives her one , lights it and takes one himself . We see the two glowing tips in the darkness . ) I think I 'm going to be good , you know . ARTHUR I know you 're going to be good . SALLY There was a moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you think that ? SALLY Dan Frink raised hell with me two days ago : he said I did n't put Dionysus into it . p. 3 ARTHUR You ca n't say Dan does n't put Dionysus into it  --  I should think you 'd all be groggy from his breath coming over the footlights . ( She laughs ; he laughs ; they laugh together . ) He 's just sore because you wo n't let him make love to you . SALLY No : I was really pretty bad that day . ARTHUR He just likes to get drunk and bully the actresses . Nine-tenths of Dan Frink is pure hot air . SALLY No : only about two-tenths . The rest is the real thing . ARTHUR There 's something real about him , I grant you ; but there 's an awful lot of phony , too . SALLY His feeling for the theatre 's not phony . After all , Dan was the person who got up the Beech Street Players , and he 's kept it going six years . No matter how absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of the theater . I owe him a lot  --  we all do . And I 'm very fond of Dan . ARTHUR He has been one of your lovers ! SALLY ( after a brief pause ) . You must n't ask me questions like that . ARTHUR It 's very natural . SALLY I know , but you have no right to . p. 4 ARTHUR Do n't rub it in that I have no rights to you : I 've accepted that . I just want to know where I stand . SALLY Well , here you are !  --  Your standing is good . ARTHUR All right , my dear . SALLY But I have been pretty flat at rehearsals lately . It 's been so damn cold in that theatre  --  you have no idea what a cold blast of air comes across the stage from those wings whenever anybody opens the front door . Dan said I had all the sparkle of a glass of fizzed-out ginger ale . The truth is I 've been getting a cold . It 's none too warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll have some heat ! SALLY I ca n't marry you , Arthur  --  I 've told you . ARTHUR But why ca n't we live together ? SALLY We do : you 've been here every day for the past two weeks . ARTHUR I should n't interfere with you in any way  --  you could go on doing everything as you do now . SALLY You do try to interfere with me . ARTHUR If we lived together , it would be different . SALLY No it would n't : I know what happens  --  I 've tried it , and you just bust up quicker that way . I 'm very well satisfied with things as they are . She sneezes . p. 5 ARTHUR No , you 're not : half the time you 're miserable . You 're coming down with grippe this minute . She sneezes again . SALLY No , I 'm not .  --  I must get up and study my lines . ARTHUR You wo n't be able to do them justice , because that noisome gas-heater will asphyxiate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move away from here  --  I like it . ARTHUR I like it , too , because you live here  --  I even have a certain affection for that horrible death-dealing heater because you 've sat with your little feet under it . But I do n't think it 's the place for you to live . SALLY My feet are n't little . ARTHUR Yes , they are : they 're darling . SALLY My dear , you 're very sweet : you flatter my defects .  --  Sometimes I love you very much . ( He puts his arms around her and kisses her  --  hitherto they have been lying on their backs . After a moment ) Will you give me another cigarette ? He turns toward the table . She sits up . He gives her one and lights it , but puts his own out in an ash-tray and does not take another . It is light enough to see the room . In the back wall to the right of the day-bed , there is a door which leads into the hall . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic and fleshy female contours seem to be combined with machinery . In the right wall are the windows with a window-seat under them . Outside , one sees the three or four-story mixed brick and brown-stone fronts of the region around Washington Square in New York . In the corner , between the window-seat and the door , is a table with an electric cooker and , above it , some shelves with dishes . In the left wall to the front is an old-fashioned coal grate , with a mantel and a piece of batik hung above it . In the corner , there is a closet opening into the back wall , near which , against the wall on the left , has been set a small dressing table , more or less concealed by a screen . The gas-heater , high , narrow and ugly , is between the closet door and the bed . On the table to the right of the bed are plain tumblers , three gingerale bottles and a half-emptied bottle of gin ; also , the pocket-book and change of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the window-seat , which has miscellaneous pillows but no cushion . A guitar lying in a chair . A shabby old comforter on the bed . During the conversation that follows , the light from the windows grows brighter . p. 6 ARTHUR ( sitting up in bed beside her ) . You love me sometimes . I always love you . SALLY I 'm terribly fond of you always . ARTHUR Why do n't you live with me then ? SALLY I 've told you : I do n't want to live with anybody . I want to be by myself . ARTHUR You 're very far from being by yourself at present : you have all kinds of people coming to see you morning , noon and night . A handorgan starts up in the street ; a merry Italian tune , succeeded by Sole Mio and a new Broadway song or two . SALLY If you live with somebody , it 's different : you get on each other 's minds . And you ca n't do that with love . Even keys to the same apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partings  --  partings as much as meetings . ARTHUR I 'd be out at the office all day . SALLY I know , but you 'd be on my mind just the same .  --  Is n't that hurdy-gurdy marvelous ! That 's one of the best features of the Village : hurdy-gurdies in the early morning . ARTHUR Yes , but I ca n't hear music . SALLY Why not ? p. 7 ARTHUR You ought to know . SALLY On account of me ? ARTHUR Yes . SALLY ( taking his hand ) . Oh , I 'm sorry , my dear : it makes me feel so mean when you say things like that .  --  Perhaps you ought n't to see me any more . ARTHUR It was the same way during the War . I used to lie awake at night in that hospital in the Vosges , and there would be nightingales singing outside , but I could n't really hear them . I could n't on account of the War . SALLY You 're so sensitive , Arthur !  --  Were you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't that I was suffering particularly . It was just that everything was wrong . I could n't even say to myself , what a beautiful day this is !  --  I 'd say , what a beautiful day this would be if only it were n't for the war ! SALLY It was n't like that for me . The people I knew down here were bitter about the war , but they managed to keep outside it  --  they had to fight to keep outside it . We still had music  --  and poetry , and painting . ARTHUR That must have been more satisfactory than taking part in it half-heartedly as I did . Here 's a poem that I wrote about it : We bear , unload , bring back and bear anewThe endless litters of war-broken men.The summer clouds catch sunset in the blue , But when shall I ever see the sun again ? p. 8 SALLY ( touched ) . That 's a very sweet poem .  --  You 're so funny when you recite your poetry , Arthur . You sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you did n't approve of poetry anyhow . ARTHUR I do n't believe in being too soulful about it . SALLY How strange that pain should make you blind ! It always intensifies things for me . I 'd have heard the nightingales more clearly . ARTHUR I ca n't see or hear when things are wrong . SALLY That 's Puritanism .  --  You 're a dyed-in-the-wool Puritan , Arthur . ARTHUR Why do you say that ? SALLY Because you make beauty depend on whether things are right or wrong . ARTHUR My feelings about you have n't got anything to do with moral right or wrong . SALLY Oh , yes , they have !  --  the reason you 're always unhappy with me is really that you think the situation 's immoral . You want to get me respectably married in an apartment with nice steam-heat and a doorman in a lot of upholstery to keep out my non-respectable friends ! ARTHUR I would n't live where there was a doorman for anything !  --  I 've pulled out of all that forever !  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same time I was in the hospital . It was the first chance I 'd had to think ; and I suddenly realized then that I could n't go back to the way I 'd lived . The war made me see what a fraud it all was and that everything that was worth anything had to be done outside all that . That respectable life is a living death ! p. 9 SALLY Why ca n't you get away from it then ? ARTHUR I do . SALLY Why are n't you happy then ? ARTHUR Because you and I are n't really together . You represent the only morality that I can care anything about . The only real morality and the only real beauty ! SALLY I sound like an allegorical monument !  --  what about Agriculture and Industry ? ARTHUR It 's true , though  --  I 've never thought anything like that about any woman before . The first time I ever met you after I 'd seen you act , I knew that you were the person I 'd been waiting for  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SALLY But now that you 've found me , you 're gloomy about me . ARTHUR Yes , I am . SALLY Maybe it 's death in you . ARTHUR What is ? SALLY Maybe you have death in you somewhere that keeps you from enjoying things . ARTHUR I do enjoy things when they 're right . SALLY But they never do seem to be right  --  and of course things never are right . They never are right for anybody  --  " Ay , look : high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation ! " Pain and death are around us all the time . They 're waiting at the end of every street , at the opening of every door ! The only thing we 've got is our courage to dare to be happy in spite of them ; and if death gets into that , we 're done for . ( She coughs . ) Hand me a handkerchief , if there is one there . He gets up to get his own handkerchief out of his trousers . He is wearing expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clean . He hands it to her . SALLY Thanks .  --  Why do n't you give the organ-grinder a penny ? She blows her nose . ARTHUR ( taking a coin from the table ) . I still wo n't be able to hear him . SALLY He 's doing his best to keep death away ! He throws the coin out the window . ARTHUR I think I 'd better shut this window . SALLY No : leave it open  --  I want to hear him . ARTHUR You 'd better let me close it in a minute . I 'll get the heat turned on . He takes a paper of matches from the table and goes over to light the heater . The organ-grinder makes a sudden spurt : the music becomes faster and louder . SALLY That 's the effect of the money : we must n't miss it ! ARTHUR That picture over the bed gives me the creeps at this hour of the morning . What 's it supposed to be ? SALLY We call it Directions for Using the Empress . ARTHUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 SALLY It 's all in knowing how to control the switches . ARTHUR I 'm afraid I 'd never master it . SALLY You ought to try . ARTHUR ( bending over the gas-heater ) . It always takes about eight matches to get this heater lighted ! ( The heater ignites with an explosion . ) Then it goes off like a gun ! ( She laughs ; he gets up and comes around to the other side of the bed . ) I 'm going to have that fireplace fixed up for you . SALLY The chimney needs repairs , and it will cost too much . ARTHUR I 'm an architect , and I can get it done cheaply .  --  ( Seeing the bottle of gin on the table ) Well , immoral as it may appear to start drinking so early in the morning , I think I 'm going to begin the day with a gin and ginger-ale ! Where 's your puritanism now ? He pours the drink . SALLY Right where it was . ( Laughing ) Give me one , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hurdy-gurdy music stops . ARTHUR ( as he pours out a glass for himself ) . You see : that 's the effect of the money ! He plays very loud for a minute , then stops . p. 12 SALLY Still , we ca n't let him starve or he 'd stop altogether . He goes over and puts the window down . ARTHUR Why do n't you take a couple of good stiff drinks and spend the day in bed ? SALLY I ca n't : I 've got to rehearse .  --  ( As she takes a sip of the drink ) All the sparkle of fizzed-out ginger-ale ! ARTHUR ( coming back and getting into bed ) . Do n't pay any attention to what Dan says . He 's always carrying on about " madder music and stronger wine . " He belongs to the Omar Khayyam period .  --  You lie down and cover yourself up . He makes her do so and tucks the clothes around her . SALLY The princess in the play is no dancing-girl : she 's something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas about it . You were magnificent the other afternoon . So long as you 're on the stage , that dismal little two-by-four stable seems as big as any theater in the world ! SALLY You have real nobility , Arthur !  --  not on account of what you say about me , but because you can see that the Beech Street Theater is really a big thing . The hurdy-gurdy starts up again , further down the street and fainter . p. 13 ARTHUR The only big things in the city now are the things that are happening down here . SALLY Yes , that 's true  --  the only things that matter . ARTHUR ( moved to eloquence by the drink ) . The people that live uptown and the people that live in the slums , they neither of them get a chance to do anything big themselves : they 're carrying the big buildings . SALLY Dan wants to declare Greenwich Village an independent republic . ARTHUR An excellent idea ! SALLY He wants to have a ceremony with spaghetti and red ink on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARTHUR Dan could supply the gas himself .  --  Why not simply send up Dan with a string to him ? SALLY We ca n't spare him  --  the string might break . ARTHUR Yes : send Dan Frink and Fred Burroughs up as a couple of captive balloons ! She laughs . SALLY To the music of a hurdy-gurdy chorus ! ARTHUR Have the drinking-fountain run vin rouge ! SALLY I 'll go up on a wire like one of those angels that they have on Italian saints ' - days  --  scattering paper roses ! p. 14 ARTHUR Paper roses with torpedoes inside that go off when they hit the pavement ! SALLY ( laughing ) . We 're getting tight ! ARTHUR The very first thing in the morning is really the time to get tight : it deprives early rising of its horrors . SALLY It 's so nice to lie here like this , is n't it ?  --  just to lie here and drink and look at the light on the wall ! ARTHUR You can enjoy the sounds of morning activity without feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it nice of all those people to get up and bustle around so briskly ! ARTHUR I am happy when we 're together like this ! SALLY ( looking at him with a smile ) . Are you really ? He kisses her . ARTHUR I love you . SALLY S Look out : you 'll catch my cold ! ARTHUR I do n't care . ( He keeps on kissing her , embracing her more purposively . ) You look so alive , darling , even so early in the morning . Your eyes are so bright : let me kiss them ! p. 15 SALLY They 're the only thing , though , that can never be kissed ! ARTHUR Darling ! SALLY ( ready to yield ) . Put my glass over there . ( He sets it on the table and is just putting his arms around her again when there is a loud sharp knock at the door . He stops . ) I 'd better go . ARTHUR Oh , let them knock ! SALLY It might be a telegram or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules and puts on a kimona from a chair . She is wearing men 's pyjamas . ARTHUR Who are you expecting a telegram from ? The caller knocks again . She goes and opens the door on a crack . SALLY Oh , Mrs. Lowrie ! She opens the door a little wider , but firmly stands in the opening so that Mrs. Lowrie can not come in . MRS . LOWRIE ( ladylike , insistent , distinct ) . I 'm very sorry , Miss Voight , to intrude upon you so early in the morning  --  I 'm compelled to do a great many things nowadays that I was never accustomed to do in the past  --  but I wanted to know whether you knew anything about Miss O'Boylan. p. 16 SALLY Miss O'Boylan ? No : who is she ? MRS . LOWRIE She 's the young lady who 's been living across the hall . SALLY Oh , yes . MRS . LOWRIE  --  And she seems to have gone away . SALLY I do n't know anything about her  --  I do n't know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's taken her trunk and all her things . I 'd allowed her to go on for three months without paying me any rent  --  SALLY So you came to see if I was still here . Well , I am , and I 'm going to pay you . MRS . LOWRIE I 'm not used to people who do n't pay their bills  --  I 've never had to do with people of that kind  --  and I ca n't have such people in my house . I owe the tradesmen myself , and I 've always paid every penny that I owe . All the years that Mr. Lowrie and I lived here  --  almost thirty-five years  --  SALLY I 'm terribly sorry about my rent , Mrs. Lowrie  --  but you see I 've been rehearsing for this play , and you do n't get any salary when you 're rehearsing , and it 's opening two weeks later than they expected it to at first  --  I thought I was going to get paid this week , but now it seems they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this conversation has been going on , Arthur has quietly gotten up and taken some bills out of his wallet on the table . He goes over and slips them into the girl 's right hand , which is holding the inside knob of the door . She suddenly pauses in what she is saying , glances aside and sees Arthur and the money . p. 17 MRS . LOWRIE Well , if people are not going to pay their rent , I 'd really rather they left at once , even owing me , so that I could get other tenants who fulfill their obligations ! It was a real wrench to rent my rooms . Mr. Lowrie and I came to this house almost thirty-five years ago  --  and my family had lived on Bleecker Street ever since the early fifties , when Greenwich Village was the fashionable neighborhood  --  SALLY I can pay you something , Mrs. Lowrie . Let 's see : I owe you for three months , do n't I ? three months , counting this month , September  --  that 's forty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to examine the money , which turns out to be considerably more than forty-five dollars . She looks at Arthur , who makes gestures to give it to Mrs. Lowrie . Going back to the door ) Suppose I pay you twenty now and the rest when my play opens . MRS . LOWRIE Oh , thank you ! I hope you wo n't be pinched . SALLY No : not a bit . MRS . LOWRIE Well , I 'm sorry to have made you get out of bed ! SALLY ( smiling ) . It 's perfectly all right : I 'm sorry I 'm in arrears . MRS . LOWRIE Miss O'Boylan 's going away had given me such a shock ! It seems to me that people nowadays are losing all sense of integrity . A young man committed suicide , I understand , in one of the houses on Washington Square , owing the landlord seven months ' rent ! Arthur , for the girl 's benefit , makes the motion of turning a crank . p. 18 SALLY I must go back to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . MRS . LOWRIE Oh , yes : go right back to bed then . You must take some phenacetin and quinine . Mr. Lowrie always took phenacetin and quinine  --  he used to have very severe colds  --  SALLY I 'm going to take some aspirin .  --  I 'll pay you the rest very soon . She smiles and shuts the door on Mrs. Lowrie . ARTHUR Why did n't you pay her the whole thing ? SALLY That 's enough for her . I 'll pay you back . ARTHUR Oh , do n't  --  I ought to contribute to the upkeep here . SALLY ( coming back and getting into bed ) . No , you oughtn't.  --  I should n't have taken it if she had n't been in such a state . ARTHUR When Mrs. Lowrie begins talking about her family , there 's nothing to do but pay the rent . SALLY The genteel ones are worse than the tough ones . ARTHUR ( exhilarated by his stroke ) . Gentility unfits people for being decent . If you 're genteel , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 19 SALLY That old heater does n't give much heat , does it ? ARTHUR Let me warm you . He puts his arms around her . SALLY I must get up and study my part . ARTHUR You look so lovely ! He kisses her , preparing to renew the attack . SALLY No , do n't : lovely or not , I 've got to study my part . ARTHUR Do n't study it right away . SALLY Yes , I must . ARTHUR Wait till the room gets warmer . SALLY I 'll study it in bed till it 's warmer . ARTHUR I 'll get the fireplace fixed right away  --  and that plaster , too : it might fall on you . SALLY No : you must n't do any more .  --  I do n't want you to be keeping me , Arthur .  --  Give me my part , like a good boy ; it 's over there on the chair . ARTHUR You come out of this old comforter just as beautiful and just as fresh as Aphrodite rising from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , but I must study , so please hand me my part . p. 20 ARTHUR ( kissing her ) . Darling  --   --  SALLY No : do n't kiss me anymore . Hand me my part , please ! ARTHUR Very well , if you really think you have to . He gets up to get it . SALLY You can give me my cues . ARTHUR All right . He comes back with the part and hands it to her. @x October : about midnight , after the opening of the new play at the Beech Street Theater . There is a party for the cast in Sally Voight 's room . The place , on which Arthur has been working , is in somewhat better shape than when we saw it first . A coal fire is glowing in the grate ; and there are a coal-scuttle and poker and tongs , a telephone on the dressing-table and a long cushion on the window-seat . A neat china closet has been substituted for the shelves in the corner by the hall door , and the electric cooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back sideways along the wall and has a cover so that it looks like a couch ; in front of it is the equipment for drinks on a table with folding leaves , now unfolded ; a punch-bowl , bottles of mineral water and whisky , glasses of diverse shapes and sizes . On a smaller table , near the window-seat to the front , are plates of cheese and sandwiches . Sally 's dressing-table corner has been dismantled , her dressing table cleared of its things , and the screen folded up against the closet door . They have obtained the use for the evening of the empty room across the hall ; and people are coming and going through the door  --  the sound of a phonograph playing dance music is heard . The room is bright , the gathering lively . There are two evening-gowns and a dinner-jacket worn by uptown subscribers ; but nobody else is in evening dress . Some of the women wear batiks ; all have the short skirts of after the war . Smithy , the assistant stage manager , a former Wobbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wobbly hair , is talking to a pretty girl near the punch-bowl . The business manager , a young man named Harry Greenaway , immature and not so young as he looks , is talking to the uptowners near the sandwiches . He is genial , cheerful and brisk , and produces an effect of hollowness . About the fire are sitting Dan Frink , the director ; Signe Angstrom , the treasurer ; Tracy Tripp , the stage manager and prompter ; and Sophie Feinburg , who designs costumes and also acts . Tracy is ironic-naive and a little feminine ; he has a smooth face of inscrutable age . Signe , about forty-five , is a tall business-like blond Scandinavian . Dan Frink , about the same age , has an orotund voice , florid face , hair which has already turned silver and large mobile magnetic eyes : he might be a professional lecturer or a popular Shakespearean actor , but he does not precisely fit into any category . Tracy and Sophie are sitting in front of the fireplace ; Dan is sitting at the side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against Tracy 's chair . Sophie Feinburg , in a sort of medieval robe de style , is sitting on the arm of Dan 's chair between Dan and Signe ; she is an intense and strong-willed Jewess , passionately devoted to Dan . All have drinks . Arthur stands at the other side of the fire , leaning on the corner of the mantelpiece . He wears rimless spectacles , a well-pressed suit , a white shirt with a soft button-down collar : the dress of the young Eastern college graduate who continues to dress like an undergraduate . SIGNE Well , it 's a play we ought to have done . It 's the kind of thing we 're here to produce ! p. 22 TRACY Did anybody see any of the critics ? SIGNE I saw Hamilton Fite for just a second . TRACY What did he say ? SIGNE He said he thought Sally was superb . TRACY The applause at the end of the Second Act was principally for Sally , I 'm sure . DAN ( talking emphatically and resonantly ) . No : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can get such a play over to a few people , we 're accomplishing our main purpose ! SIGNE Yes : it 's a play we ought to have done . DAN What we exist for is to release the creative currents : the non-conductors wo n't carry them , but the conductors will ! TRACY Augie Blum was there , with a beautiful white front . ( To Signe ) Did he say anything about the play ? SIGNE I only talked to him a second . He said he thought it was a play we ought to have done .  --  But his attitude did n't encourage me to ask him for any more money .  --  He said he thought Sally was splendid . TRACY The old goat ! ARTHUR Does anybody know where she is ? p. 23 TRACY She said she was going out with some friends . ARTHUR I could n't find her at the Green Goblin or Scarlatti 's . TRACY I do n't know where she went . SIGNE I do think , Dan , that the last act might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Boag away ; I promised him I 'd do it just as he 'd written it . SIGNE But that scene where she wears the metal face and the philosopher talks at such length  --  the audience ca n't see Sally , and nobody understands the speech . TRACY She looks very lovely , though , sitting there absolutely motionless . DAN I consider that speech one of the great things in the play ! SIGNE It 's beautifully written , Dan , but nobody understands it . DAN I understand it : it contains the whole idea of the play . SIGNE What does it mean then ? DAN It means , in a word , that Beauty has no answers for Wisdom . SOPHIE Beauty is a deeper wisdom . SIGNE Where does the egg-beater come in then ? p. 24 DAN That 's not an egg-beater , my dear ! SIGNE What is it then ? DAN It 's the essence of a scepter . TRACY It 's an abstract scepter . SIGNE What does that long rigmarole mean  --  about " a million million immaculate beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms . TRACY ( speaking at almost the same time ) . It 's the Platonic idea of souls . Signe and Arthur laugh . SIGNE If there 's as big a difference of opinion about it as that , I should n't think it would do any harm to take it out . SOPHIE They can be souls and atoms both  --  it 's a metaphysical conception . DAN Why , it 's one of the most thrilling things Boag has done !  --  he 's the first writer who 's made poetry out of modern physics !  --  If people do n't like it now , they will like it !  --  if they do n't understand it , they will understand it ! SIGNE Well , I always thought it was a play we ought to do . Loud knocking is heard at the door , accompanied by a clanking sound . Arthur goes over and opens . Fred Burroughs makes a tumultuous entrance , attracting , with an instinct for dramatizing himself , the attention of everybody in the room . He is a big large-limbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions ; his shirt has come open at the neck , and the knot on his necktie has slipped . He is drunk , and is brandishing a cow-bell. p. 25 ARTHUR Hello , Fred . FRED Hello , Arthur !  --  Listen , Arthur !  --  what do you think of my new publicity stunt ?  --  ( Clanking the bell ) Hear ye ! hear ye ! hear ye ! I bring tidings of the Beech Street Players !  --  Hear ye ! hear ye ! hear ye ! The Zinc Princess at the Beech Street Theater !  --  Listen , Arthur : I 'm going to go into all the wine-cellars and all the first-class restaurants tomorrow night and I 'm going to ring this bell and make everybody stop eating , and then I 'm going to say , " Hear ye , ladies and gentlemen ! "  --  or rather , " People , male and female ! "  --  because you have to insult them : the artist must always insult his audience  --  " People , male and female , hear ye ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to the Grove of Apollo ! The Grove of Apollo , as you may not have heard , has been moved to Number Fifty-nine Beech Street , the home of The Beech Street Players !  --  Apollo is not dead , he liveth !  --  You will find him in Beech Street with his muses  --  with Melpomene , and Calliope and Thalia  --  and Sally Voight and Sophie Feinburg !  --  You will find them at the Beech Street Theater !  --  the performance begins at 8:30 , and the scats are a dollar fifty each ! Come one , come all , kind friends : the poetry and the wisdom and the glory that were Greece are at the Beech Street Theater tonight ! "  --  Is n't that a wonderful publicity stunt , Arthur ? p. 26 SIGNE Why do n't you hang the bell around your neck , Fred ? TRACY Hang it around your neck and shake your head from time to time . FRED You do n't understand the significance of the cowbell , Signe : Apollo was a cowherd , you know ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal to keep me away . FRED ( throwing his arm around Arthur ) . Do you think it 's vulgar , Arthur ?  --  do you think it 's vulgar ? The poet must always be vulgar !  --  he 's above and below the middle class : Shakespeare held horses and got plastered in the winecellars  --  Villon was a common yegg  --  Aeschylus was beaned over the head in a brawl and his friends said an eagle dropped a tortoise on him !  --  all the poets are rogues , all rogues !  --  A drink , Arthur !  --  I crave a drink ! ARTHUR ( as he gets him one ) . You have n't seen Sally in the wine-cellars , have you ? FRED No , Arthur : I have n't seen Sally since the play  --  she was magnificent in it , Arthur ! ( As Arthur hands him the drink ) Thanks . ( Turning to Dan ) Listen , Dan ! I 'm going to write a play for you !  --  I want to tell you about this play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Dan , but still holding the attention of the room ) Listen , Dan : it 's a play about Don Juan  --  it 's a play about Don Juan coming to Bethlehem .  --  Is n't that a wonderful idea ! ( He takes a drink . ) Don Juan comes to Bethlehem , and he stops over night at an inn , and suddenly he hears a commotion in the courtyard  --  he looks out and there he sees the Magi with the people all gathered around them . ( He takes another drink . ) There they are , the wise men who have come from the East following the strange unknown star , walking in their stiff silken robes and with their gifts of frankincense and myrrh . So Don Juan goes down to see what 's going on  --  and he follows them into the stable , and there he finds them kneeling before the manger . " What 's this ? " he cries , " some Eastern mummery ? "  --  who are all these old bozos with the whiskers who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and a child of the people ?  --  " Ho , father ! " he cries , tweaking the Magi 's whiskers ( He makes as if to tweak Arthur )  --  " Ho , father : tell me what it is that thy learning teacheth thee to prize more than wanton love in a wench 's arms ? What bringest thee this long way in foul weather ? " " Hast seen the star ? " say the Magi ,  --  " The star that guided us here ? "  --  p. 27 TRACY " Guidedst us here , " you mean . FRED " The star that guidedst us here . " ( Laughter ) It 's not " guidedst " , it 's " guided " !  --  Damn you , Tracy , you rogue  --  I can handle my own language  --  I speak the great language of the Elizabethans !  --  " Good fathers , " says Don Juan to the Magi ,  --  " Thy purblind astronomy doteth !  --  the proud stars keep their courses : they disdain to direct us humans ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he eyes them with a supercilious smile . ( Fred illustrates. )  --  And then suddenly : he sees the ox and the ass going down on their knees in their stalls  --  Harry Greenaway has detached himself from the group and quietly comes over to Fred . HARRY ( very quietly and tactfully ) . I think you ought to be a little bit careful , Fred , of the susceptibilities of the uptown subscribers . I think the Sullivans are Catholics . FRED ( louder ) . To hell with the uptown subscribers if they ca n't look on reverently at a mystery ! This is a miracle play ! ( The Sullivans smile , amused . ) Don Juan sees the ox and the ass go down on their knees in their stalls  --  and suddenly he experiences a strange sensation  --  he feels the hinges of his knees giving way beneath him ! He fights against it , his pride fights !  --  ( Fred illustrates , clenching the hand which is not holding the glass ) but he finds that he can no longer stand upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to water ! He sinks down ! ( Fred sinks with a bump , still holding the glass in his hand )  --  and then suddenly he recognizes the mother , and he cries , " Mary !  --  Mary !  --  What child is this , Mary ? Can this be the child that our dalliance begot when we sported together in the hay ?  --  Mary ! my sweet witch of Nazareth ! "  --  Is n't it terrific ?  --  do you get it ? Don Juan is the father of Christ ! p. 28 SIGNE The only thing I did n't understand , Fred , was whether you were supposed to be the ox or the ass . FRED ( getting up from his knees ) . That 's all right , Signe : it 's a tremendous thing , a revolutionary thing  --  it 's more revolutionary than Nietzsche ! ARTHUR And more alcoholic than Poe . DAN Do n't let anybody kid you , Fred : you 've got the vital fire ! FRED ( putting his arm around Arthur again ) . A drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help yourself . Fred goes over to the drinks . The general conversation is resumed . The door opens and Sally comes in . She is flushed and excited and looks very attractive . She is wearing an embroidered Cuban shawl , which she has put up over her head . People gather around her as she takes off her coat and puts the shawl down around her shoulders . THE ADMIRERS You were simply marvelous , Sally ! It 's the best thing you 've ever done . You could have heard a pin drop during the Second Act ! You gave such a beautifully modulated performance ! SALLY I 'm so glad you liked it !  --  Really ?  --  Oh , thank you very much ! p. 29 FRED Here she is : the Tenth Muse , Sally Voight ! ( Holding up his glass ) I pay you homage , Sally ! SALLY ( smiling ) . Thanks for your homage , Fred ! Seeing that he can no longer hold the center of the floor , Fred turns his attention to a pretty little brunette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARTHUR ( who has come over to Sally and has been quietly standing by during the outburst of congratulations ) . I have n't had a chance to congratulate you myself . SALLY Hello , Arthur .  --  Did you think I was all right ? ARTHUR You were marvelous.  --  What became of you after the show ? SALLY Some friends came to my dressing-room , and I went out with them . ARTHUR Why did n't you bring them up here ? SALLY They had to get back to Brooklyn . ARTHUR Well , they kept you long enough . I was afraid something had happened to you . SALLY ( controlling irritation ) . Well , you must n't think things have happened to me whenever I 'm out of your sight . p. 30 ARTHUR I just thought you might be tired . SALLY I am , but I can still get around . ARTHUR Do n't you want a drink ? SALLY I do n't know .  --  Yes : a very little one . Arthur makes her a highball very carefully . The uptown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their wake . Sally turns to talk to them . SIGNE ( to her companions by the fire ) . Arthur adores Sally , does n't he ? TRACY She 's loosened him up : he 's more human than he was . DAN Sally gives life to everybody !  --  she 's one of the great givers of life ! Arthur hands Sally the drink . SALLY ( pleased by the uptowners ' compliments ) . Thank you ! FRED ( picking up the little girl in the red blouse ) . Come dance with me ! dance with Pan !  --  you have the grapecrushed mouth of a bacchante !  --  Come with me ! Today is Satyrs ' Day , and I am Pan , the shaggy-flanked goat-god !  --  Come with me ! we will twirl the thyrsus together ! Come and dance with Pan , O grape-reddened maenad !  --  come and twirl the thyrsus with Pan ! He carries her out to the room across the hall . p. 31 SIGNE Fred is in one of his obstreperous moods tonight . TRACY I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN ( who is well charged with drinks himself and stimulated to put on a performance of his own by seeing Sally coming over toward them ) . It 's tonight ! it 's the play ! it 's Sally . It 's the beauty we created together tonight  --  the beauty we created in the Beech Street Theater , with the tenements all around us and the Elevated growling at the door !  --  We had a success tonight , Sally !  --  it does n't matter what the critics may say ! it does n't matter about the receipts at the boxoffice ! Something happened tonight with Boag 's play and Sally  --  and with us all ! New life in art has been born !  --  Sally : I have a part for you : we 'll do it in the spring !  --  Aristophanes ' Lysistrata !  --  the woman who called a woman 's strike and stopped the Peloponnesian War ! SALLY That sounds like great fun . ARTHUR ( who has come over and is standing on her right a little behind her ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN That 's because they 're never done the way they ought to be !  --  I 'll do Lysistrata the right way ! p. 32 ARTHUR If you did it the way it ought to be done , you 'd have to do it outdoors in a stadium . DAN We 'll do it on our twenty-by-twenty stage .  --  We 'll have the Acropolis right here in Beech Street !  --  The time has now arrived in the evening when we rise to a higher level of vision and require another round of drinks !  --  Let me fill your glass , Signe ! He takes her glass and his own and goes over to the table and fills them . Tracy has picked up the guitar and has been strumming chords on it . SALLY Sing that song about the New Orleans girls , Tracy ! She sits down on the arm of his chair . Arthur resumes his place by the mantelpiece . TRACY ( sings ) New Orleans girls are gettin ' mighty frisky  --  Take a little cocaine in their whisky  --  Oh , ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whiff on me ! You keep on a talkin ' till you make-me thinkYour daddy was a bull-dog , your mammy was a mink ! Oh , ho , Honey , take a one on me ! Take a ( sniffs ) on me ! At the second line of the second stanza , Sally has joined in and she sings the last stanza with him , sniffing with great relish.Whiffin ' coke is mighty bad , But that 's a habit I never had ! Oh , ho , Honey , etc. p. 33 ARTHUR Gosh , that 's a depraved song ! SALLY I think it 's a wonderful song ! TRACY Here 's another song from the South : Oh , love , oh , love ! oh , careless love ! Oh , love , oh , love ! oh , careless love ! You break de heart of many a gal  --  You never break dis heart of mine ! Oh , when I wore my apron low , You 'd follow me through rain or snow  --  But now I wear it to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! Oh , love , oh , love ! oh , careless love ! Oh , love , oh , love ! oh , careless love ! You break de heart of many a gal  --  You never break dis heart of mine ! SALLY ( who has been listening to the song intently ) . What a beautiful song , Tracy !  --  But why did he pass her up when she wore her apron to her chin ? TRACY The idea is , I guess , that she was pregnant and was wearing her apron that way to cover it up . ARTHUR Why was n't her heart broken then ? SIGNE It was  --  but she did n't want to admit it . TRACY She was a modern girl . She was taking it in her stride . p. 34 SALLY ( smiling ) . She was just as careless as he was ! There is a terrific crash across the hall , and the phonograph music stops . TRACY Good God ! ARTHUR What 's happened ? He starts for the door . SIGNE It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me , Arthur !  --  I 've done a terrible thing . Arthur ! I 've smashed your victrola ! ARTHUR How did that happen ? FRED I was dancing with it , Arthur !  --  the spirit of Pan took possession of me and , having no pastoral pipes , I was dancing with the victrola  --  I was fighting this mechanical age , Arthur , this age that divorces the musician from the music ! ARTHUR You 've divorced us from the music all right ! FRED Do n't be angry with me , Arthur !  --  forgive me !  --  It really was n't my fault ! somebody opened the door and gave me a push from behind  --  and the whole mighty edifice came toppling down in one stupendous world-deafening cataclysm ! ARTHUR I forgive you , but it 's too bad to stop the dancing . p. 35 FRED Then let me have a drink , Arthur ! I 'm in desperate need of a drink !  --  I feel the way Samson felt after he 'd pulled down the pillars of Gaza ! ARTHUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRED Then do n't be a Philistine , Arthur !  --  You 're a worshipper of Apollo , you know you are , in spite of the creases in your pants !  --  so give the Great God Pan a drink ! ARTHUR The drinks are at your disposal , but I would n't drink any more now if I were you . FRED ( pouring out a great slug of gin ) . You must n't be angry with me , Arthur ! SMITHY ( appearing in the doorway ) . Has anybody got another phonograph ? DAN We 've got one . SOPHIE You could n't bring it over : it 's too heavy . DAN Come over to my place then !  --  Sally needs a rest anyway . SOPHIE You have nothing for them to drink . DAN I 'll get something ! ( Getting up from his chair and making his voice resound ) All come to my house ! The Princess needs a rest . But for us the heights of the evening still rise in iridescent uplands . We must have dancing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tonight we shall look down like gods and see the world unrolled at our feet  --  and not only in space but in time ! We shall behold the lost Atlantis  --  and the future of the Beech Street Players !  --  My place is at 18 MacDougal Street !  --  Do n't lean too hard on the railing and ignore the smell in the hall ! p. 36 THE COMPANY Very well , All right . Fine ! They begin to get their things and say goodby . SALLY I do n't want you all to leave . DAN You must go to bed . You told me you had n't been sleeping . SALLY Yes , I should , I suppose . He takes both her hands in his . DAN You must .  --  You 're a great actress since tonight , and you must learn to take care of yourself : that 's one of the responsibilities of greatness . SALLY You did most of it , Dan . DAN No : we all did it . But we 've still got to work on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . SOPHIE ( who is jealous of Sally , trying to get him away ) . We 'd better go over : they 'll get there and wo n't be able to get in . DAN ( to Sally ) . Good night then and plenty of sleep ! SALLY Good night , Dan dear ! He and Sophie go . The guests depart in a mass : Arthur , Sally and Fred are left . FRED ( coming up as Dan goes ) . Let me stay here a quarter of an hour , Sally !  --  I do n't want to go over to Dan 's ! p. 37 SALLY I 've got to go to bed , Fred  --  I 'm really terribly tired . FRED They 're murmuring against me , Sally  --  they 're giving me dark looks and dirty glances .  --  I can feel the air full of malignant mutterings !  --  let me stay for just one more drink ! ARTHUR Sally 's worn out : she wants to go to bed . During the conversation that follows , Sally says goodby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintive ) . Just one more drink , Arthur ! Do n't still be angry with me , Arthur !  --  I broke your victrola , Arthur , but something in me is broken now : when I came here tonight I was a positive force , I drew people about me like a lodestone  --  and now in one brief deafening crash , all my power has passed from me ! ARTHUR You never have any consideration , Fred , for anybody 's troubles but your own . Ca n't you understand that Sally needs rest ? He takes Fred by the arm and pilots him toward the door . FRED You 're politely getting rid of me , Arthur ! ARTHUR I was n't trying to be so very polite . FRED Listen , Arthur : today is Satyrs ' Day !  --  p. 38 ARTHUR That 's the beginning of the open season on satyrs . FRED I ca n't go over there , Arthur : I could n't stand their silent aversion ! ARTHUR Why do n't you go home then ? FRED I ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SALLY Good night , Fred : I 've got to go to bed . ARTHUR ( pushing him out the door ) . Good night . Can you make the stairs all right ? FRED Listen , Arthur : I 'm no sodden pothouse sot  --  I 'm a drunkard of classical stature !  --  Arthur shuts the door on him . Everybody else has gone . ARTHUR ( to Sally ) . Good God ! how does a person get that way ? FRED ( ringing his cow-bell outside the door ) . I 'm calling my satyrs ! do you hear me ?  --  I 'm summoning my ribald rout of satyrs !  --  They 're going to besiege you and drink up your liquor , so you might as well give me a drink ! ARTHUR I 've seen some persistent bores , but Fred makes them all look like pikers ! FRED ( giving the bell a last clank ) . I 'll send my satyrs to plague you !  --  damn you , Arthur Fiske ! p. 39 ARTHUR ( toward the door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , shut up ! SALLY ( who has gone over and lit a cigarette and sat down in front of the fire ) . He 's all right when he 's not tight . ARTHUR But he 's always tight . SALLY Well , do n't be so smug about him . ARTHUR I 'm not : but he makes himself a damned nuisance . SALLY I 'm very fond of Fred Burroughs : he 's written some darn good poetry and he was nice to me when I first came to the Village . ARTHUR I suppose he 's one of your old flames . SALLY Suppose he is . ARTHUR I should n't like to believe it . SALLY Why should n't you like to believe it ? Fred 's got real imagination , and he 's got the courage to live up to it . And he has great sweetness really . ARTHUR It was n't in evidence tonight . SALLY Fred was never a lover of mine . He was married to Marcella then . But he used to take me out to dinner when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 40 ARTHUR Very well , my dear : I wo n't be nasty about him .  --  Now you ought to go to bed . SALLY That superior tone of yours !  --  What did you ever do to be patronizing about poor old Fred ? Fred had to go to work as a farm-hand before he 'd finished primary school , and he was boning out Greek in the hayloft when you were having it poured into you at college  --  and being kept like a pet pony ! ARTHUR College is n't so much fun . SALLY It 's more fun than starting out in life without a cent of your own . ARTHUR Now you 're in one of those moods when you talk as if you were a proletarian . You 're not a proletarian  --  you 've always belonged to the white-collar class . Your father was a foreman  --  a boss : you belonged to the upper stratum of Braxton Falls , Mass . You had a very good education . SALLY There 's no real upper stratum in a mill-town . ARTHUR That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Do you imagine that when the mills close down , a foreman 's any better off than anybody else ? ARTHUR I 'll bet my kind of people are much worse off and much worse to be with than your kind of people . You talk about going to college as if it were a great advantage : you do n't have any idea of what it 's like to spend four years in college , expecting to find something that 's more interesting than home , and then to face the fact , when you leave , that it 's all been a vague dream . By that time you look forward to getting out : you think that then things will be real  --  but you find yourself just back at home , and you realize that four years of college have just been a preparation to come back and live like the people you 've always reacted against . You look at them and think , " Oh , my God ! " There are the family still sitting around with their confounded collections of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that they 're glazed and that they 're a collection , too  --  and then you realize that you 're part of the collection yourself , that you 've just been taken out and polished up , and that now you 've been put back on the shelf ! p. 41 SALLY You at least had a nice quiet shelf . I never had any quiet at all . My mother used to have love affairs and take me with her and make me wait for her out in the hall , and my father would threaten to kill her , and my brother would fight with my father . You never had poverty and fighting at home and no prospect of ever getting away from it ! ARTHUR You 're exaggerating ! SALLY ( furious ) . I 'm not exaggerating : you do n't know what life is really like , that 's all . It 's a desperate , disgraceful quarrel ! ARTHUR I know : I saw the war . SALLY You only saw it as an officer : you do n't know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not really excited now about what I know about life : you 've been out with somebody tonight . ( She is silent . ) Who was it ? ( She is silent . ) It was n't Fred , was it ? SALLY No . ARTHUR You might as well tell me about it : there 's no use in concealing these things . ( She is silent . ) Is it somebody you 're in love with ? SALLY Yes . A silence . p. 42 ARTHUR ( wounded , more subdued ) . Who is he ? SALLY You do n't know him . ARTHUR What does he do ? SALLY He 's a newspaper man . ARTHUR Oh .  --  Is he somebody you 've just met ? SALLY No : I told you about him . ARTHUR The one you went away with ? SALLY Yes . ARTHUR I thought you and he had parted . SALLY We had ; but he came to the play tonight . ARTHUR Do you want to marry him ? SALLY He 's married . ARTHUR Do you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You told me that affairs with married men were very unsatisfactory arrangements . SALLY I do n't want to talk any more tonight . I 've got to go to bed , and you must go ! ARTHUR Very well . SALLY ( getting up and taking her purse off the dressing-table ) . Here 's the twenty dollars I owe you . p. 43 ARTHUR Did he give it to you ? SALLY No.  --  Signe advanced it to me . ARTHUR I wish you would n't pay me back . SALLY I 'm sorry Fred Burroughs broke your phonograph . ARTHUR Do n't be silly . He takes the money . SALLY Now please go and leave me , Arthur . ARTHUR All right .  --  Good night . He hesitates a moment about kissing her , then leans down and kisses her forehead . SALLY Good night . ARTHUR I 'll shut up the room across the hall . SALLY Yes : thank you for arranging about it . ARTHUR Shall I see you tomorrow ? SALLY I 'm going to sleep all morning , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round after the theater in the evening . SALLY All right . ARTHUR Good night . SALLY Good night . He goes out . Left alone , after a moment 's intense thought , she begins picking up the glasses and emptying the ash-trays into the fireplace . She sets the guitar in a chair . p. 44 SALLY ( singing to herself ) . New Orleans girls are gettin ' mighty frisky  --  Put a little cocaine in their whisky ! Oh , ho , Honey , take a sniff on me ! A knock on the door . SALLY Hello !  --  Who 's that ? A MAN 'S VOICE Sally ! She goes over quickly and opens the door . SALLY Oh , Bugs ! He is a man in his middle thirties , an Irishman . He has a belted ulster and a rakish felt hat . BUGS All alone ? SALLY Yes . He embraces her and holds her . SALLY I thought you 'd gone home . BUGS So I did  --  I went and I stayed fifteen minutes and I came away as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was n't your wife there ? BUGS She was , and the way she greeted me  --  before she 'd even kissed me  --  was to ask me whether I 'd gotten the plumber . SALLY ( smiling ) . I bet you hadn't. p. 45 BUGS ( taking his coat off and sitting down on the day-bed ) . Of course I had n't : she 's asked me so many times that now I 'm never going to do it ! SALLY Do n't you want a drink ? BUGS Of course I want a drink !  --  I want to drink with you all night ! SALLY ( getting him one ) . You did n't walk out on account of the plumbing , did you ? BUGS Of course I walked out on account of the plumbing !  --  and on account of about a million other things  --  on account of the 1880 hat-rack and the 1910 phonograph records and the set of dinner-plates with gold edges that my mother-in-law gave us for a wedding-present !  --  I try to turn away from you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like the sunflower turning its back to the sun ! SALLY ( smiling ) . You ought to have had the plumbing fixed , though . She hands him the drink and sits down beside him . BUGS I 've been having things fixed for fifteen years , and the household 's just as unsound as it ever was !  --  It ca n't be fixed  --  it can never be fixed !  --  you ca n't fix up those Sunday dinners when I always insult the guests !  --  When other people have got the leprosy , when the flesh begins dropping off their bones , you 've got to make a break and get away ! There 's no use in being soft about it ! The well and the sick ca n't live together ! p. 46 SALLY I know : if you try to be kind to them , you find they 've wrapped their tentacles around you , and instead of your helping them up  --   --  BUGS They 're dragging you relentlessly down  --  down to the dark slimy sea-floor , where the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pal with the lower crustaceans and corpses that once were men ! SALLY Do you care about me really ? I did n't know after the last time . BUGS Sally , you 're all there is in the world ! I saw your face and I heard your voice all the way back to Brooklyn ! SALLY You ought n't to have come . It will upset your wife . BUGS Why should they keep us from having what they ca n't have themselves ? Why should the lame keep people from walking ? Why should the blind keep people from seeing ? Goddam them : the lame , the halt and the blind ! Goddam them : the cripples ! SALLY Yes , you 're right : goddam them ! He puts his arms around her and they kiss , sitting static in a savage embrace. @x November : late afternoon . It is dark outside , and there is a reading lamp turned on near the fireplace . The cooker is back in place and the corner with the dressing table as it was in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , is sitting in front of the fire , reading the afternoon papers , which are lying around him on the floor . He throws down the one he has been reading . BUGS The damned swine ! He looks sullenly into the fire . Sally comes in from the theater . SALLY ( glad to get back to him ) . Hello ! BUGS ( glancing around ) . Hello . SALLY What 's the news from the strike ? BUGS The news from the strike is that the picket-line was broken up this morning by mounted bulls and company thugs . One woman was beaten insensible and most of her teeth knocked out , and five men have been sent to the hospital , one of them probably dying . SALLY Were you there ? BUGS Yes : I saw it , and it was a perfectly cold-blooded performance . The company had arranged with the police to put a stop to the picketing this morning . But do you think I can tell about it in the Telegraph-Dispatch ? p. 48 SALLY Wo n't they let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this ! ( He picks up one of the papers and hands it to her , showing her the place . ) They 've actually changed my copy ! They 've got me saying that the pickets were rioting . They 've practically got me saying that they were banging their heads against the police clubs ! SALLY And you told about the police attacking them ? BUGS Of course  --  and they 've concocted a fairy-tale , with McCaffrey , the company 's ape-man , as Prince Charming ! SALLY How can they dare to do such a thing ? BUGS It 's the first time they 've ever done it to me . I ought to have stayed in the office , goddam it , and gone to the mat about it . I knew they were going to get panicky , but I thought if I was n't there , they would n't have the nerve to change a signed story . SALLY Ca n't you make them publish something correcting it ? BUGS No : they wo n't confess they 're lying swine . SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUGS Jesus ! You see people booted in the ribs and women with blood running out of their mouths , and you keep yourself from getting into it because you think you can tell people about it  --  and then the very words that you 've written are made to whitewash the police ! p. 49 SALLY You can tell about it in the Masses . BUGS Yes , but who reads the Masses ? Nobody but the radicals who write for it . The ordinary public will never be told that there 's civil war going on over in Payson . SALLY I know just how you feel : I felt that way once when I lost out on a part that I 'd been rehearsing for weeks . BUGS The radicals are right , though : there 's only one way to fight it  --  go over to the other side . I will write about it in the Masses and anywhere else that 'll let me  --  and I 'll tell about what happened to my story . If they do n't like it , they can can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? BUGS Yes : of course .  --  And I might as well do it myself ! SALLY Why do n't you just go ahead and see what happens ? BUGS No : I might as well do it myself  --  and I might as well do it now ! He gets up . SALLY Think it over tonight , why do n't you ? Maybe there 's something else you could do . BUGS No : I 'll do it myself right now . It 'll give me the greatest satisfaction to pass along those kicks in the slats I saw this morning to those punks in the city-room ! ( He goes to the telephone . Sally lights a cigarette and watches him . ) Hello : give me Bowling Green 6000 Hello ! I want to speak to Mr. Murchison Hello , Charley : This is Bugs . I want to thank you for what you did to my article . It 's typical of your fair-minded attitude that you should want to see the police get a break Well , I 'm sorry , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get in touch with me ? You know I 'm always either at home or at Scarlatti 's No , I do n't exaggerate : it sounds as if I 'd suddenly changed my mind and decided the strikers were bums  --  and it makes me write a goddam lie ! Only a few words ? Well , it 's only a difference of a few words between a decent guy and a yellow dog ! Well , give me Bradley : I 'm following the buck All right : goodby . Be kind to policemen ! ( He hangs up and addresses Sally . ) They had orders from Bradley , the owner , it seems . ( He takes up the receiver again . ) Bowling Green 6000 Hello : I want Mr. Bradley 's office Hello : This is T. P. Brophy . I want to speak to Mr. Bradley Hello , Mr. Bradley : this is Brophy . My article on the textile strike was changed in the city-room today , and I was told that you 'd said to Murchison that my stories had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand behind American industry , but do you want it to stand behind the Columbia Woolen Company , which is beating up American citizens for exercising their constitutional rights ? There 's no other attitude possible for anybody covering the strike than to report the simple facts , which I witnessed : that the police and the company thugs made an unprovoked attack on the pickets I do n't need radical sympathies to tell what I saw happen . Well , I 'm through then Yes , my point of view is different  --  but you go ahead and stick to yours : you stand behind American industry , and when American industry goes into a tailspin , you 'll  --  ( Mr. Bradley has hung his receiver up . ) Hello ! ( He hangs up . ) He 's hung up . Well , that 's that .  --  Good Christ : I do n't see what else I could have done ! p. 50 SALLY I think you did quite right . BUGS Good God ! You ought to have heard him blahblahing about promoting industrial peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten to the Beech Street . BUGS Of course he has : he 's cockeyed all the time ! He ca n't even see what 's happening on the stage ! He sits down in the chair again . SALLY How can they allow a man like that to review plays ! BUGS On a newspaper everybody 's cockeyed : it 's the only way they can stand it . It 's the old drinking psychology of , " Let 's pretend . " You know how you can get yourself through a lousy life by getting drunk part of every day and imagining that things are different from what they are and ignoring the way things really are during the part of the day when you 're sober . Well , we newspaper men have got it down to a science , so that the part to be ignored is a minimum and is ignored as completely as possible . We manage to keep ourselves in a state where we 're almost persuaded that the world is the way the paper represents it . We 're even able to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the paper would like to have them happen . I really failed in my duty as a newspaper man this morning when I looked on at that massacre sober , but it was too early in the day to have had a drink . None of the men from the other papers were there at all . Sally comes over and kisses him and sits on the arm of his chair . p. 51 SALLY What you did was fine : I 'm glad you did it . BUGS Well , now I 'm out of the haze and out of a job , and thank God ! SALLY You can easily get another one , ca n't you ? BUGS I do n't know , but I 'm not going to worry about it just now . I 'm feeling so much better since I told the Dispatch to go to hell ! I 've been waiting for this , to tell the truth , every day for a week . Every day I expected the ax to fall . SALLY Really ? BUGS When I handed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another bouquet of roses for Rosa Mancowitz ? " She 's one of the strike-leaders . SALLY Yes , I know . BUGS And now I feel a damsight better . That thing upset me this morning . It makes you feel like hell to stand by and not take part in a fight like that . But I 'm jobless now the same way they are ! SALLY Oh , you 're really a fine person , Bugs .  --  I 'm not going to call you " Bugs " any more .  --  I ca n't bear to call you that awful name  --  I 'm going to call you by your right name , " Tom . " How did you ever happen to be called " Bugs " ? BUGS I 'm supposed to be nuts , I guess . p. 52 SALLY Well , you 're not : you 've simply got more courage than most people and you feel about things more keenly . BUGS You believe in me . Gracie does n't believe in me . SALLY Why does n't she ? BUGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that interfere with her plans . SALLY ( smiling ) . Is that so ?  --  How did you happen to marry her ? BUGS A co-ed college .  --  She 'd be all right if she was married to one of these intelligent college instructors . I got her away from one and I ought to have let him have her . SALLY Have you been home lately ? BUGS No  --  and I 'm not going to attempt it as long as I 'm out of a job .  --  Well , we 'll go out and have one last good old blow-out tonight , and I can worry about the rest tomorrow ! SALLY Do n't spend all your money . Let 's have dinner here . BUGS That 's too much trouble . SALLY No , it is n't . I 've got a lot of things and I 'll cook it . BUGS You 've got enough else to do . It begins to snow outside . p. 53 SALLY It 's no trouble . I 'd love to get dinner . I 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got eggs and canned tomatoes and almost everything  --  and there 's that bottle of red wine from last night . BUGS I 'll go out and get some more . SALLY No , do n't . Now that you 're not working on the paper , you do n't need to drink so much , you know . BUGS Yes : I 'll get up and write something in the morning . SALLY Let 's do that all week : let 's eat at home . It 's easy to get dinner for two people , and it 'll take my mind off my part . BUGS You ca n't be a good cook : it would make you too good to be true . SALLY ( laughing ) . Well , we 'll see . ( He kisses her , and she kisses him back . They sit with their arms around one another , looking into the fire . Sally jumps up . ) Well , let 's see what I 've got . ( She goes over toward the cupboard , but stops before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowing ! Great big flakes ! Did you ever see such big ones ! I 'm going to leave the shade up so that we can see it ! ( Going on to the cupboard ) Let 's see : yes , I think I 've really got everything .  --  Everything except a green pepper . ( She comes back to him. ) p. 54 BUGS I 'll go out and get it . SALLY ( sitting again on the arm of his chair ) . Do n't go yet . BUGS No : it 's swell to be here with you . SALLY We 'll just be here together with the snow falling all around . Just the night to eat at home , and have an omelet and a bottle of wine ! BUGS Live like the workers . SALLY Yes : my father was a textile worker , you know . BUGS My grandfather began as a bricklayer . But what do we go and do as soon as we get hold of a little money ? We dig ourselves into dreadful bourgeois domesticity  --  like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that yet . BUGS You 're a genius . SALLY How do you know you 're not a genius ? BUGS I only talk like one at times . SALLY You 've never written the things that you ought to . BUGS I know : I never give myself the time . When I get money , I blow it all in on getting away from home . SALLY Are you comfortable with me leaning on you like this ? p. 55 BUGS Comfortable ? I 'm so damn comfortable ! I 'm relaxing for the first time in a week ! SALLY You 've been under a strain , have n't you ? BUGS That strike had me all keyed up . SALLY I know . She kisses him gently on the cheek . BUGS I was ready to kill everybody in the office because I thought they were all getting against me  --  and now I do n't feel sore at them anymore . I ought n't to have been so damn nasty to poor old Charley Murchison : he needs kis job , of course , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his age it is n't much fun taking orders from a younger man . The police and the pickets and the company and the union are all the same to Charley . And Bradley is just a jackass with a quiet vein of criminal cunning : one does n't resent such people . SALLY You must be tired . We 'll go to bed early . You got up so early this morning I did n't even know when you went . BUGS Your hand looked so fine on the pillow the way you sleep with your arm under your head , and your forehead with your hair brushed away looked so noble . It was dismal as hell and I did n't want to get up , but I knew that this was going to happen this morning and that there 'd be nobody there if I did n't go  --  and I wanted to do something that was a little bit nearer to being like your forehead and hands . p. 56 SALLY Did you really feel like that about me ?  --  You make me feel ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch . ( He kisses her , and they remain in silence , with their arms around one another . A knock at the door . ) I hope that 's not anybody annoying ! BUGS Keep ' em out if it is . SALLY Yes , I will . ( She opens the door ; Dan , Sophie and Harry are outside , snow on their hats and coats . ) Hello , Dan  --  hello , Sophie ! Come in.  --  Hello , Harry . ( They greet her and come in . Harry is carrying a brief-case ; Dan , a paper-bag . They greet Bugs . ) BUGS Well , how 's Uncle Tom coming on ? HARRY We believe that Uncle Tom is going to be a stupendous success ! DAN It 's always a stupendous success , but we 're going to make it a great play . BUGS Have you solved the bloodhound problem ? DAN We 've solved it with brilliant ingenuity ! In the first place , it turns out that Smithy can bay like the Hound of the Baskervilles  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have puppets of the dogs and throw the silhouettes on a backdrop .  --  And Sally 's going to be such an Eliza as has never been even imagined !  --  ( To Sally ) I want to talk to you about it tonight . p. 57 SALLY Sit down . SOPHIE We ca n't stay : we 've got to get back for dinner . SALLY Is that dinner in that bag ? Let me see ! ( She looks into the paper-bag . ) Oh , green peppers !  --  the only thing I needed for my omelet ! Now I 'll tell you what you must do : you must all stay to dinner here ! I 'm going to make a Spanish omelet ! SOPHIE We 've got liver and bacon at home . SALLY It 'll keep . Now , you must stay !  --  You 're always twitting me about not being practical . I want you to see that I can make an omelet ! SOPHIE I do n't believe that cooking is your department . SALLY ( looking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine ! It 's just like The Swiss Family Robinson !  --  Let us borrow these things and we 'll pay them back ! I 've got a beautiful Edam cheese , too  --  that matches the other things ! We can talk about Eliza afterwards ! DAN ( to Sophie ) . Let 's stay : we can go home early . SOPHIE It wo n't be early if you get to drinking and talking ! SALLY Now , Sophie : you and Dan sit down  --  and , Harry , help me set the table ! p. 58 SOPHIE You better let me help you with the omelet . SALLY I do n't want you to do a thing . You sit down and forget about it . I want to prove to you I 'm really a cook ! She goes over and turns on the electric cooker and has Harry open a can of tomatoes . He brings out the folding table , puts it in front of the window-seat , unfolds the leaves , and sets it . Dan and Sophie sit down on the day-bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bugs ) . What 's happening to the strike ? BUGS The thugs beat up the pickets this morning : six pickets in the hospital , one a woman . SALLY They would n't print Tom 's story , so he 's thrown up his job . DAN Did you ? Good for you ! I wondered how you were getting away with it . BUGS I 'm not any more . DAN Good God !  --  the greatest drama of the time and you ca n't write about it in the papers !  --  Why do n't you do a play about it , Bugs ? We 've never had a real labor play in America . BUGS I 've thought of it , but I 've never had the time . DAN You 've got the time now if you 've quit your job . p. 59 BUGS I 'll have to get something else right away . DAN ( becoming enthusiestic and excited ) . No , Bugs : you must write a play about Payson  --  you must write it right away  --  and the Beech Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rash with your promises , Dan ! The actors did n't get paid last week . DAN I 'll find the money myself ! SALLY If you 'll write the play , Tom , I 'll cook dinner for you every night . BUGS That one-acter of mine you put on did n't go over so badly , did it ? DAN It was superb ! You 've got the sense of the theater  --   --  HARRY Sophie can be Rosa Mancowitz . SOPHIE I would n't want to play Rosa Mancowitz : I know Rosa Mancowitz too well . BUGS Rosa 's a great woman . SOPHIE She 's a great neurotic , if that 's what you mean . BUGS She 's one of the biggest forces in the labor movement today . SOPHIE ( at once becoming vehement ) . She has the power to hypnotize the workers and to make them lay their heads down on the chopping-block . That 's what she 's doing with your Payson strike ! p. 60 BUGS Even a losing fight 's worth while . SOPHIE Why is it worth while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ! The union will simply throw out your Communists and then sell out to the company ! BUGS Well , the Communists at the present time are the only group who 've got any guts . SOPHIE They are fanatics  --  Rosa Mancowitz is a fanatic ! She can accomplish nothing as an organizer  --  nothing ! I used to work with her  --  I know all about her ! I used to be a Socialist party worker . BUGS Well , what in God 's name do the Socialists hope to gain by backing the Farmer-Labor Party ? Bob LaFollette is a million miles from socialism . SOPHIE But if we can get Socialist candidates elected ! We try to do only what is possible : the Communists attempt the impossible ! BUGS They 've succeeded pretty well in Russia . SOPHIE Russia ! There 's no socialism in Russia ! BUGS You Socialists ought to hear the news about the October Revolution ! SOPHIE The October Revolution was not a socialist revolution . The socialist revolution has to occur in a highly industrialized country . Russia is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild tales about Russia , but this Socialist idea that the October Revolution is merely a newspaper story  --   --  SOPHIE No ! there is no socialism in Russia !  --  If you think there is socialism in Russia , you do n't know what socialism is ; but I know , because my father was a Social-Democrat in Germany  --  he was a friend of Edward Bernstein and Karl Kautsky  --   --  BUGS Our fathers guessed wrong about a good many things . SOPHIE Why are n't you a Communist yourself then ? SALLY Dinner 's ready . Bring your politics to the table ! She directs them , and they take their places : Dan with his back to the window-seat ; Sally at Dan 's left ; Harry next to Sally on the other side ; Sophie beside Harry ; and Bugs , facing Sally , at the end . DAN Politics is bankrupt since the War . It 's a waste of time to argue about it . You 've got to deal with fundamental values . HARRY This soup is grand , Sally . SALLY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you pour the wine ? Bugs does so . HARRY This is all exceedingly jolly ! Music is heard outside ; it is a band playing It 's a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight , which passes through Beech Street under the windows . The light of torches is seen . p. 62 SALLY What 's this excitement ? HARRY The election . SALLY I 'd forgotten all about it . DAN That just goes to prove the truth of what I was saying . I bet you do n't even know the candidates ' names . SALLY Yes , I do . DAN Are you going to vote ? SALLY I did n't register . DAN Did anybody here register ? Is anybody going to vote ? HARRY I thought I 'd take a chance on Lafollette . SOPHIE ( to Bugs ) . I suppose you 're going to vote for Foster . BUGS I would if I had n't been so busy that I did n't get a chance to register . SALLY Well , here 's to the defeat of Coolidge ! BUGS And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to the success of Bugs 's play , which can do more to make people see the truth than any political party ! SALLY ( to Bugs , smiling ) . You 're going to start on it right away . BUGS If God spares me , tomorrow morning . p. 63 DAN You must make people see it just as you did ! BUGS I 'll make them see how we 're all mixed up in it ! SALLY You ought to have a torch-light parade in it marching through a starving mill-town with banners about Republican prosperity . Sally takes away the soup-cups and gets the omelet from the cooker . DAN ( as the music , turning the corner , grows fainter ) . I do n't mind that old tune they 're playing , though . It reminds me of my youth in the West . They may use it for political rallies , but what it 's singing about is still our old America . BUGS That old America 's gone . That 's their marching song now while they trample on it . SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't trample over our omelet . They ca n't do anything to our salad and our wine . ( She sets the omelet on the table , then turns to the windows and pulls down the shades . ) Even the snow is covering up their tracks . DAN Yes : they ca n't do a damned thing to us ! They ca n't rob us , because we have n't any money ; they ca n't tempt us , because we do n't want what money can buy . And they ca n't intimidate us , because we 've been beyond good and evil , and we 've come back , and all we need now to make us happy is an omelet and a bottle of wine . Here 's to Sally 's magnificent omelet ! They lift their glasses and drink . p. 64 SALLY ( sitting down ) . Thank you ! HARRY I never had one with spice in it before , Sally . SALLY What do you mean ? There is n't any spice in it . HARRY Do n't I taste cinnamon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I must have grabbed the cinnamon shaker instead of the pepper shaker : they look exactly alike ! BUGS Do n't worry : it gives it an exotic tinge . SALLY I 'm afraid it makes it taste rather sickish.  --  Oh , I 'm so terribly sorry ! HARRY Do n't worry , Sally : it 's fine ! SALLY Well , Sophie , I guess you were right . You 'd never have done that , I 'm sure . SOPHIE Just scrape the outside off , and it 's all right . BUGS All it needs is a touch of allspice ! DAN Do n't pay any attention to them , Sally . You 've created a new and splendid kind of omelet ! BUGS We 'd better get it eaten up quickly or Dan will be trying to put it on at the Beech Street ! They laugh about this. @x A dark afternoon in December . Tracy Tripp has dropped in on Sally . He is sitting on the day-bed , and she , further front , in a chair . There is no fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRACY You 're depressed , are n't you ? SALLY Not exactly : just a little dreary . It 's the weather , I guess . TRACY Is n't it horrible ! SALLY It 's so darn bleak and black : there do n't seem to be any afternoons any more . TRACY And cold . You ought to have a fire in the grate . SALLY When nobody 's here to attend to it , I never seem to do anything about it . TRACY I had a godawful fit of gloom myself as I was coming along Eighth Street just now . I suddenly remembered that I was thirty-three , and I got to thinking about all the achievements that other people had to their credit by the time they were thirty-three . Take Christ , for example : by the time he was thirty-three , he 'd really done a very remarkable thing  --  but I do n't think I 've got any talent for that sort of thing .  --  Then Napoleon was Emperor at thirty-three  --  but I have n't got the nasty ruthless character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TRACY I 'm much too sophisticated for Joan of Arc : I could never take table-tipping seriously .  --  And I have n't got the build for a Lincoln .  --  I think literature would be more in my line . SALLY I 've always thought you could write , Tracy . TRACY I 've been thinking of doing a novel  --  about two old aunts of mine who used to sew their bedclothes up like sleeping-bags . It 's time I did something important . SALLY I 've been feeling I was wasting my time lately , too . I 'm not really doing anything now . If we put on Night Watch next , I sha n't even have a part . TRACY Harry wants to take Uncle Tom uptown . SALLY I know , but that part of mine does n't amount to anything .  --  Harry 's against me now . Since Sophie and Dan have broken up , she 's succeeded in getting Harry into her clutches , so that Harry 's against everything that Dan wants to do . TRACY Harry and Sophie have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SALLY They have n't got the real spirit of the theater though . TRACY But Dan is an idiot in some ways , and the thing might n't have lasted as long as this if it had n't been for Harry . p. 67 SALLY Dan knows what he 's doing : he 's right about not wanting to take Uncle Tom uptown . TRACY But why ?  --  if there 's a chance of a big success . SALLY ( very scornfully ) . Oh , anybody can make a success of Uncle Tom  --  the kind of success Harry cares about ! TRACY Well , it 'll all be thrashed out , I suppose , at the meeting this afternoon . SALLY Yes : I 'm dreading that meeting . The atmosphere 's been getting sort of strained lately . We 're not working together the way we used to . TRACY You must n't get gloomy , though , my dear : it 's all right for me to , but not for you . Whatever they do , they ca n't let you be eclipsed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they know it .  --  Well , I must go over and see Sophie at the theater . He gets up and puts on his coat , pulling the collar up  --  he wears no hat . SALLY It was nice of you to come in , Tracy : you 've cheered me up . TRACY Has Bugs Brophy gone away ? SALLY He 's been looking for a job . TRACY I have n't seen him around for a couple of weeks . p. 68 SALLY He had to go out of town about it . TRACY He 's been doing a labor play , has n't he ? SALLY He did n't have any money , and he thought he ought to make some before he started . TRACY That 's a hard line to stick to , labor  --  even more unprofitable than art . SALLY He 's more or less known as a radical now , and the editors are getting afraid of him . TRACY That 's another man I never could be : Lenin . The only time I ever tried to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they called me up from downstairs and asked for me as Mr. Whoozis , I told them he was n't there .  --  Well , I 'll see you later at the meeting . SALLY Yes . Goodby , Tracy . She goes to the door with him and holds it open as he leaves . TRACY ( out on the landing ) . Hello , Bugs . Good God , you must have found Success ! BUGS ( appearing at the door in an enormous new fur coat ) . Announcing Mr. Charles E. Mitchell of the National City Bank ! SALLY Oh , Tom , where did you get that coat ? p. 69 BUGS ( embracing her ) . The better to hug you with , my dear ! He has had some drinks , is in a state of exaltation . SALLY But where did you get it ?  --  Let me see . She turns on the switch by the door . BUGS I stole it . SALLY Have you got a new job ? BUGS I 've got a new job ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you really ? BUGS I did . I stole it direct from the maker  --  and the manufacturer stole it from the fur-workers  --  and I 'm going to give it back to the workers . SALLY You 're drunk . BUGS I 'm exhilarated . There 's nothing so exciting as stealing ! SALLY But you do n't mean it really , Tom  --  tell me really , what have you done ? BUGS Well , in the first place , I 've done some articles for American Success  --  on leading industrial sons-of-bitches.  --  That 's why I did n't come back before  --  I did n't want to see you till I 'd finished them .  --  But I delivered the first two today  --  I thought I 'd kept them objective and gotten in the labor angle , too  --  but by the time the editor had gone through them , I realized that I 'd just contributed a couple more bucketsful of slush to the glorification of American business .  --  That was the first crime I committed ; and the second I committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? BUGS Well , I walked away from the office with the check for $1500 in my pocket , and I began to think about buying a fur coat  --  I 've always wanted a fur coat , and yet at the same time the idea revolted me  --  they 're what all the big business pirates wear . They skin them off the sweat-shop workers , and I said to myself that when I took money from a magazine like American Success , I was receiving their stolen goods ! I said to myself that I was yellow , that I did n't have the guts to do my own stealing . The professional thief takes a risk , but when I write for a thing like American Success , I 'm received by pretty girls in tony offices , and everybody is oozing good humor . Well , I used to know a professional fur-thief one time when I was writing a crime series , and he told me the way he used to do it . So I went over to the fur district in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and I said I wanted to buy a coat and I talked about it and looked at coats and kept on looking at coats till they got sick of me and left me to myself . Then I went into the store-room at the back and hid there behind one of the fur-racks , and I stayed there till the shop was shut up . Then I opened the window and grabbed a coat and got away down the fire-escape . SALLY You 're absolutely crazy , Bugs !  --  You see you 've got me calling you " Bugs " again . p. 71 BUGS I 'm not crazy , whatever you call me : you have to do something to compensate !  --  I had a great feeling of triumph when I got away with this coat . I 'd been lurking half-smothered in there with the smell of the hides of all those poor damn muskrats and skunks that had been slaughtered and made to masquerade as sable and chinchilla and ermine . I thought how they 'd once been wild and happy in the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cheap people and to be hung up in that damn stifling loft building ! And the people in there all day running the stitching machines and pounding down the furs on the boards !  --  they use up the animals for their skins and the human beings for their skill , and they shut them all up in these loft buildings or in offices that might as well be lofts ! When I looked out the window at the back , there was nothing but the blank wall of the next building , and the walls of the stock-room were blank the same way  --  and I felt the negation of the city  --  the negation of everything that 's human !  --  the burden of deadness and boredom that the people work harder than the beavers or the squirrels to pile up on their own backs !  --  SALLY Oh , I know : it 's horrible , it 's hideous ! That 's just the way I 've felt today ! BUGS I felt when I broke out of that fur-loft that I was breaking out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been caught ! BUGS I 'd have said that I was just a reporter doing a story on how easy it was to steal . SALLY Suppose they find out about it . BUGS They wo n't . It 'll be a long time before they miss one coat , and I 'm going to give it to the charities . I stole it to give it back to the people who made it . SALLY You ca n't steal them all and give them back ! BUGS No : it 's only for my own self-respect ! They 've taught us to treat property as sacred , and even when we think we 're rebels against them , they make us protect their interests  --  they make us keep their laws when they do n't keep them themselves ! Well , I 've proved to myself I 'm not scared of them  --  to hell with their moral system !  --  And what you and I are going to do now is take this money that I 've expiated and spend it ! SALLY You must n't spend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write your play . If you were getting your convictions on paper , you would n't have to be stealing coats . BUGS I had to make some money , Sally . I do n't mind abandoning my family , but I do n't want to see them starve .  --  They have n't called up here or anything , have they ! p. 73 SALLY No.  --  Why should they ?  --  BUGS Gracie usually locates me and calls me up and tells me that one of the kids is sick  --  and then , when I go home , the kid is all right . SALLY Well , you 'd better get in touch with her right away . It would n't be nice if she came here . BUGS I 'm going to , and there 's plenty of money for everybody , and you and I are going to take some of that money and we 're going to do again the whole thing we did last summer ! SALLY I ca n't get away from the theater  --  not till Uncle Tom has closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Eliza . It 's no part for you anyway . SALLY I might , I suppose . They 're apparently going to revive Night Watch for the next production , and there 's no part in that for me . BUGS You really ought n't to be fooling around with these high-school theatricals anyway ! SALLY It does seem rather amateurish sometimes . BUGS They 've done some beautiful things , but the whole business hangs by a shoe-string  --  they never can give you a real production . p. 74 SALLY I know . BUGS Let me get you a job uptown . SALLY I 've had one or two offers of parts uptown , but I wanted to stay with the Beech Street . BUGS You ought to have more of a chance , though : you 've stuck down here too long . When we come back , I 'll get you something on Broadway . I know a lot of theater people . And in the meantime , tell them that you 're leaving the cast ! SALLY I 'll ask them at the meeting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at the Frontenac . SALLY Why do n't we go to some place in the country where you really can be quiet and work ? BUGS I can work up there ! SALLY You must somewhere . BUGS Now you go and pack your things  --  because we 're going to a hotel tonight ! It 's too damned cold here . SALLY I 've got to be at the theater at 8 . BUGS We 'll just have time . Pack your suitcase now , and while you 're at your meeting , I 'll go and get mine , and I 'll meet you at the theater , and we 'll have dinner at the Vanderpool . SALLY All right ! She gets up and takes an old suitcase out of the closet and starts packing her things in it . p. 75 BUGS We 'll go where the world is so bright inside that we wo n't care how black it is outside ! I 'll get some champagne , and we 'll have it in our room ! SALLY I 'd better wait till after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the ice tonight . BUGS I suppose I ought to call up Gracie and tell her that some cash is on the way . She probably has the police out looking for me . He goes to the phone . SALLY It would be fine if they found you with that coat ! BUGS Flushing 5461 . ( To Sally ) They won't.  --  Hello .  --  Hello , Billy . How are you ? What ? What did she do ? What did she drink ? ( Evidently shocked by what he hears . Sally stops packing , to pay attention . ) Did you send for a doctor ? Oh , hello , Alice : what 's happened ? You 've got a doctor there . What does he say ? He has ? Yes : I 'll come I 'll come right over . I 'll be there right away ! ( He hangs up . ) SALLY What 's the matter ? BUGS Gracie drank carbolic acid . SALLY Is  --  is she seriously ill ? p. 76 BUGS I do n't believe so  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go over there right away . BUGS ( putting on the fur coat ) . Damn Alice !  --  She 's Gracie 's sister : she took great satisfaction in telling me  --  she probably worked deliberately on Gracie 's mind , making her feel how miserable she was ! SALLY Do you think you 'd better wear that coat ? They wo n't be getting the police in , will they ? BUGS No.  --  What the hell do I care anyway ?  --  Would n't it just work out like this ?  --  That was the boy I had first on the phone . He hates me . He 'll always hate me !  --  Well . goodby , most beautiful , most noble ! ( He takes her hands , then kisses her . ) I 'm sorry this has turned out so sour . SALLY Goodby . You better go right away . ( He opens the door and goes . ) Goodby.  --  Call me up and let me know how things are . BUGS ( on the way downstairs ) . I will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then begins unpacking the suitcase and putting the things back in their places . There is a knock at the door . She hastily closes the suitcase and puts it in the closet , then goes to open the door . p. 77 SALLY Oh , hello , Signe . SIGNE ( coming in ) . Would you mind if we had the meeting in your room , Sally ? There 's no heat in the place above the theater  --  Tracy forgot to order the coal . SALLY I 'm afraid I ca n't come to the meeting , Signe . SIGNE You must come : we 've got to decide about the next production and about taking Uncle Tom uptown . It 's really awfully important . SALLY I know : but something dreadful has just happened . SIGNE What 's the matter ? SALLY Bugs Brophy 's wife has just tried to commit suicide . SIGNE Oh ? Sally sits down on the day-bed and Signe sits down beside her . SALLY He just called up from here , and they told him about it . SIGNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she all right ? SALLY I do n't know : she was still alive when he talked to them . SIGNE Any suburban housewife married to Bugs Brophy would have been sure to try to commit suicide sooner or later . Sonya Katchalov tried to commit suicide when Ilya first fell in love with me , and I felt terribly about it , but now she 's happily married and working in an uptown picture gallery , and she high-hats the life out of me when she sees me. p. 78 SALLY I feel sick . SIGNE Of course you do ! SALLY I do n't feel like seeing people . SIGNE I 'm sorry I told them to come here  --  but I think you ought to take part in the meeting .  --  You ca n't do anything about the other thing , and this will help you keep your mind off it . We need you : there 's a real crisis . Harry 's working openly against Dan and has more or less gotten Tracy and Fred on his side . SALLY I know : but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast your vote on our side , anyway . Sophie 's attached herself to Harry since she and Dan broke up , and it 's really split the group into two factions . SALLY That 's another thing that 's my fault , I suppose ! Dan 's been coming here tight lately because he was afraid to go home to Sophie  --  and Sophie 's been sore at me about it . I could n't help it : he 'd come in and pass out , and I 'd have to let him stay here all night . SIGNE Well , you must stand by Dan and me ! SALLY It 's all too silly and detestable !  --  I 'm sick of the whole thing ! The idea that people ca n't leave each other free !  --  that one person ca n't be different things to different people  --  that several people ca n't share one person ! A knock at the door . p. 79 SIGNE Well , please stick by us today : we 've got to keep the theater together ! SALLY ( getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure there 's any use is trying to have a group like this if things like that can break it up ! I do n't feel like standing up for anything . She opens the door to Harry , Sophie , Dan and Tracy . Harry , as usual , carries his brief case . HARRY Hello , Sally ! we thought maybe you 'd have a fire . The coal supply has given out over there . SALLY It 's not very warm here . HARRY Compared to the theater , it 's tropical . ( He takes off his coat . ) Well , is everybody here ? SIGNE Everybody but Fred . HARRY We might begin without him , do n't you think ? SIGNE No : I think we ought to wait for Fred . He 'll be here : he told me he would . Signe remains on the day-bed , and Dan sits down beside her . Sophie sits on the opposite side of the fire , and Tracy on the nearer side . Harry remains standing . Sally stretches out on the window-seat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation . p. 80 HARRY He understands the situation . We can get his vote later . SOPHIE I saw him going into Scarlatti 's , so he 's probably good and drunk by this time , and no use to anybody anyway . SIGNE He promised me to keep sober . HARRY Fred 's promises , I fear , are writ in water  --  or rather , in alcohol . DAN I think we ought to wait for Fred , Harry . HARRY We must n't take all night this time , however . DAN Why should n't we take all night , if we need to ? SIGNE Yes : there are some very important questions to be decided . SOPHIE The great curse of this group is too much talk : we talk when we ought to be working . DAN I 'm not sure we do n't work when we ought to be talking , Sophie ! There are some things that have to be settled before there 's any point in working at all , and they can only be settled by discussion . HARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little metaphysical , Dan  --  and tonight we ought to think about practical matters . Fred 's loud knock at the door . p. 81 SIGNE Come in . Fred comes in . FRED Am I late ? I 'm sorry !  --  I 'm sober though !  --  I just refused a double cognac , offered me by a prospective patron !  --  ( He sits down next to Sophie , at her right . ) I 'm trying to sell him the idea of translating Rabelais into modern American slang . Do n't you think that 's a wonderful idea ? He really seems very much interested . He took me out to Scarlatti 's and  --   --  SOPHIE Is that the cognac you refused I smell ? FRED No , that 's the cognac I drank , but I refused the second one  --  really I did ! I refused a double fine that was offered me by this wealthy connoisseur who 's making overtures to be my Mcenas ! SOPHIE How heroic ! FRED Do n't insult me , Sophie ! I 've got a lightning brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  HARRY Well , let 's proceed with the business of the meeting . ( General silence ) First I want to lay before the group a statement of our present financial situation . ( He produces a slip of paper from his pocket and refers to it . ) We started the year with $1964.75  --  almost $2000  --  and we lost on the Zinc Princess $1160.55  --   --  p. 82 SIGNE It seems to me , Harry , that if any financial statements are going to be made , I am the person to make them . I 'm the Treasurer . HARRY In my capacity of Business Manager , I was just summing up the general situation . DAN I think that any financial statement ought to come from Signe , Harry . SIGNE It 's true that we lost money on The Zinc Princess , but we 're making money on Uncle Tom  --   --  SOPHIE The question is , why ask for another big loss by putting on a Greek play ? DAN That 's just what we 're here for , to take losses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me say a word about that . The Beech Street is an idealistic organization : we all know that . That 's why we 're interested in it , that 's why we stick by it , that 's why we 're willing to take losses , if we have to . Well and good : that 's as it should be . But why should we take losses when we do n't have to ? If we go on putting ourselves in a hole , we 'll have to quit altogether . SIGNE What makes you think we wo n't put ourselves in a hole if we take Uncle Tom uptown ? That theater will cost $600 a week , and if we do n't fill it every night , we 'll be in a worse hole than ever . We 'll simply have two money-losing theaters instead of one . p. 83 HARRY Eddie Applebaum says that we 've got an excellent chance of success , and he 's about as hard-boiled as they come . DAN Eddie Applebaum be damned !  --  the Beech Street Players was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody 's sick to death of Night Watch  --  this would be the third time it had been revived . DAN Night Watch is a good honest little play , but we 've produced it and put it over , and we 're done with it . We 've got to go on to something else . SOPHIE Tell them your proposals , Harry . HARRY Well , what I was going to propose was simply this : Why not take Uncle Tom uptown  --  why not try it for a week or two , anyway , and  --  put on Night Watch down here , with Fred 's Don Juan in Bethlehem for a curtain-raiser  --   --  FRED I 've got to play Don Juan , Harry ! HARRY That 's up to Dan . DAN ( sulkily ) . Thanks .  --  I 've got to see Don Juan rewritten before I want to see it played at all . FRED ( aggrieved ) . You do n't appreciate my blank verse , Dan ! p. 84 DAN I appreciate your blank verse , Fred , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in your plays . FRED I 'm the reincarnation of Marlowe , Dan . Why is it strange that we should think the same thoughts and even express ourselves in the same tropes ? HARRY Let me go on with what I was saying . I was suggesting a revival of Night Watch . Now , there is n't any part for Sally  --  there 's only one woman 's part  --   --  SIGNE Sophie 's part : yes . HARRY But I 've got a really brilliant idea ! Why not have Sally double in Uncle Tom ?  --  Why not have her even do three parts if she feels she can take them on ?  --  She might do Eliza and Mrs. St. Clair and Simon Legree 's girl-friend , all three . She 'd make a brilliant job of it , I 'm sure . Think of the range you 'd have , Sally !  --  And another advantage would be that it would enable us to save a couple of salaries , since everybody 's getting paid the same amount . SIGNE I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's really inadequate for the part  --  she was the only member of the cast who got bad notices . SIGNE I do n't approve of doing things in that way . p. 85 DAN Most certainly not ! Every actor in the Beech Street Theater has a right to the part he 's rehearsed and opened in . SALLY I would n't take Ellen Winters ' part for anything ! She has one of the most beautiful voices I 've ever heard , whatever the reviewers may say ! DAN There 's one reason which we have n't discussed why I 'm absolutely flatly opposed to taking Uncle Tom uptown , and that is that if it 's done on Broadway , it 'll be done there as a burlesque . I 'm absolutely opposed to burlesquing it , and I have been all along . Uncle Tom 's Cabin is a serious play  --  it had a part in changing the course of this country 's history  --  and it can still be made a powerful play . I made it a powerful play , and the audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . There was scarcely a titter or a giggle throughout the whole performance . But something has happened to it  --  I do n't know who 's responsible , but now they laugh at every other line . As I say , I do n't know where the inspiration for this horsing and clowning has come from , but I feel pretty certain that the actors have n't been playing for laughs like that without the definite encouragement of somebody ! HARRY You have n't been around , Dan : when we wanted you to jack things up , you were n't there . p. 86 SOPHIE You 've been off on a spree for three weeks . Somebody had to attend to the production ! DAN Well , somebody debauched and debased it ! Somebody betrayed me and betrayed the Beech Street and betrayed everything the Beech Street stands for ! Somebody betrayed our vital relation to the history of America itself ! HARRY ( facetiously ) . Is General Benedict Arnold among us ? SIGNE Dan 's right  --  he 's absolutely right about the burlesquing business : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the issue seems to be clearly drawn , and I suggest that in order not to waste further time , we take a vote on the two programs immediately : on the one hand , to move Uncle Tom uptown and put Night Watch on again down here ; and , on the other , to put on Lysistrata and to take Uncle Tom off  --  even though it may be running to capacity houses . That 's your idea , is n't it , Dan ? DAN My idea is that the Beech Street Theater should stand as a positive force that loses , if need be , against all the negative forces that gain ! FRED Damn it , Dan : you 've got a great spirit !  --  but you think that art 's got to be unsuccessful . Shakespeare tickled the groundlings : why should I be contemptuous of Broadway ? p. 87 DAN You 're tickling them the wrong way , Fred : they think your Simon Legree is funny . SIGNE Why not have two Topsies the way they do in the tent-shows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready to vote on it , Fred ? SIGNE I 'm not going to let this question be put to a vote till I 've had a chance to express myself !  --  SALLY ( sitting up on the window-seat ) . And before we go any further , I want to say very definitely that unless Dan 's program is carried out , I resign tonight . HARRY The understanding was , Sally , that every program was to be voted on . SOPHIE We did n't realize that some of our members might put their personal ambitions above the good of the organization ! SALLY I do n't care about Lysistrata  --  play it yourself , if you want to ! HARRY ( tactful ) . Of course we understand , Sally , that your feeling is perfectly disinterested  --   --  SALLY It is disinterested , Harry : I care about the theater much more than about playing any particular part . p. 88 HARRY But I really ca n't see , Sally , that there 's anything particularly sinister about moving Uncle Tom to another theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's particularly sinister about it is that , as Dan says , it 's cheapening Uncle Tom . We do n't want to cheapen anything ! This whole world we live in is cheap enough already , and what we ought to be doing is trying to give people some image of the dignity and beauty of life !  --  DAN And that 's why we want to do Lysistrata . SALLY Yes : that 's why we ought to do Lysistrata  --  we 've got to fight for life itself against all the ugliness and deadness the way Lysistrata did ! DAN We 've got to fight for the intellectual light that comes down to us from ancient Greece through all the darkness and wreckage of history , and which will still be burning when Broadway and its works are deader than the Coliseum ! SALLY Yes : we 've got to fight for those things against this black overpowering city . We 've got to show people that life was n't always like this and that it does n't have to be always like this  --  because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great square mountains of stone with wretched squalor down in the cracks between them  --  and banging typewriters and squealing motor-horns and silly electric signs . Everybody else is caught in all that ; but we 've got to manage to keep out of it . There are lots of people in a place like New York who want to do fine things and brave things , but they ca n't because they 're already involved  --  they 're like animals caught in bear traps , trying to drag the traps and only skinning their legs to the bone . And we 've got to keep out of the traps ! p. 89 DAN Every second-rate ambition is a trap ! SIGNE And all this personal business is another kind of trap ! SALLY And we 've got to watch our step every moment !  --  DAN Because all the great artists who are dead depend on us to see through what they worked for ! SIGNE And when young boys of genius like Boag and Keith Mitchell have only got us to give them a hearing ! SALLY When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harried around in a city like this depends on us to speak for it and to help it to speak for itself ! There is a moment 's silence . FRED You make me ashamed , Sally !  --  You make me feel that I 've been a bemused egoist !  --  You and Dan are absolutely right : we 've got to bring fire like Prometheus : the Eighth Street car-tracks are our Caucasus and the Sixth Avenue El is our vulture ! SALLY Why do n't you play Lysistrata , Sophie ?  --  you 'd be better than I would , I think : you 've got a more impressive presence . SOPHIE I do n't want to play it , thank you : I 'm not bawdy enough ! SALLY Well , why not do Keith Mitchell 's play next , then ? There 's a splendid part in that for Sophie  --  and a part for me , too . p. 90 SIGNE Shall we put Sally 's proposal to a vote ?  --  Keith Mitchell 's play and we close Uncle Tom . HARRY I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to Dan 's eloquence  --  because as a matter of fact I 've been very much moved by them  --  but I have certain doubts about Keith Mitchell 's play  --   --  DAN So have I , Harry , but we 'll get him to fix it up  --  and I think that 's the real solution . We can do Lysistrata in the spring . SIGNE Let 's vote then . All in favor say , " Ay . " ( Dan , Signe , Tracy , Fred and Sally hold up their hands and say , " Ay " . ) Very good : that 's the program then ! ( She gets up . ) Listen , Dan : I want you to call a rehearsal tomorrow and put the performance back the way you want it to be . DAN I will : I should n't have let it slump . SIGNE Are you doing anything for dinner , Sophie ? SOPHIE I 'm having dinner with Harry . SIGNE Let me butt in on it , will you ? I 've been wanting to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fred and Tracy have gone over to talk to Sally . Dan remains standing in front of the fire . p. 91 HARRY ( waving as he goes ) . Good night , Sally ! TRACY You certainly rebounded after touching bottom  --  I mean , after this afternoon ! FRED That was true greatness , Sally !  --  greater than any part you ever played on the stage ! TRACY Good night , my dear . ( Kissing her ) I 'm going to be a better boy all the rest of my life , and the change in my character will be all due to you ! SALLY ( grinning ) . I hope you will , Tracy . FRED My Mcenas is waiting for me with a double fine : I must n't let him down ! Good night , Sally ! SALLY Good night , Fred ! Smiling , she sees them out the door . DAN ( when they have gone , as she comes over toward him ) . You were wonderful , Sally : you turned the meeting . SALLY I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN They would have if it had n't been for you . SALLY Dan : why did you break with Sophie ? p. 92 DAN Oh , I do n't know : it got to be impossible . SALLY You must be nice to her . You must n't let her hate you . You must make her be good in this play . DAN I will , if she 'll let me.  --  Sally ! He kisses her . SALLY Oh do n't , Dan : I do n't want you to do that ! I do n't want to be made love to : I 've had enough of love ! DAN This is for the prophetess and the artist  --  for gratitude and in deep humility . SALLY Oh , Dan : I kiss you like that , too ! She returns his kiss with emotion. @x February : a dreary and damp afternoon . The heater is on , but there is still no fire . Sally is lying on the day-bed , earnestly studying her part . A knock at the door : she gets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello . SALLY Come in . ARTHUR ( shaking hands with her , a little awkward ) . How are you ? SALLY ( smiling ) . I 'm fine .  --  How are you ? ARTHUR All right .  --  How are you getting along with Lysistrata ? SALLY Pretty well , I guess . It 's a marvelous part . ARTHUR I know it  --  and you 're just the person to do it . SALLY ( going back to the day-bed ) . Oh , Arthur , I 'm glad you came ! I was afraid I was never going to see you again ! She sits down on the day-bed , and he sits down beside her . ARTHUR ( a little less constrained ) . I 'm awfully glad to see you .  --  You 're not free for dinner tonight , are you ? p. 94 SALLY Why  --  yes , I think so .  --  Dan Frink may come in . ARTHUR I see .  --  Are you living with Dan now ? SALLY No : I 'm living here alone . ARTHUR I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't you , if you can ? SALLY All right . ARTHUR What happened to your newspaper man ? SALLY Nothing . He 's all right . ARTHUR He 's gone away , I hear . SALLY Yes : he had to go to Havana . ARTHUR He 's gone back to his wife , I understand . SALLY She 's been ill , and he had to take her away . ARTHUR ( who has been prowling around the room as he talks ) . You ought to have a fire . Does n't it work ? SALLY I 'm all right with the gas-heater : it 's getting warmer . ( He looks into the coal-scuttle , which is empty . ) How did you get along with that house on Long Island you were doing ? ARTHUR Very unsatisfactorily . The people are absolute idiots . We had to make three different sets of plans , and the ones that they finally approved were cockeyed . The architect has no more chance than anybody else when it comes to working for stupid rich people .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 've missed you perfectly frightfully. p. 95 SALLY But your brother must have been relieved that you have n't been hanging around Greenwich Village ? ARTHUR To hell with my brother ! I 've resigned from the club , so I never have to see him at all . SALLY You should n't have done that , should you ? You 'll miss it , wo n't you ? ARTHUR ( seeing a glass jar full of large pills on the table by the day-bed ) . I know what those pills mean ! SALLY You notice everything , do n't you , Arthur ? ARTHUR That looks ominous : I think I ought to know about it . SALLY No : it does n't concern you at all . ARTHUR How do you know ? SALLY Because I know . ARTHUR What will you do if it does n't work ? SALLY None of your business , Arthur . ARTHUR After all , it 's a pretty serious matter . You must be beyond the stage for pills . Have you been to see a doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's going to do something about it , if necessary . p. 96 ARTHUR Who did you go to : Hirschbein ? SALLY Yes . ARTHUR Good God ! I would n't trust him to dress a scratch . You 'd better let me send you to a place I know . SALLY Do n't worry . I 'll be all right . ARTHUR Your other boy friend 's no help if he 's gone away to Cuba . You ca n't even pay for it , can you ? SALLY He 's going to send me money .  --  He may even be back now . ARTHUR Oh .  --  But suppose he does n't come back and suppose he does n't send you money . He 's a bum , I understand . SALLY No , he 's not : he 's in a difficult situation . ARTHUR So are you . You 'd better let me take care of you . SALLY You 're very sweet , Arthur , but I do n't want you to help me any more . ARTHUR Why not , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I 'm going to do it , I suppose I ought to get it over before Lysistrata opens . ARTHUR You should ! If you 're ill , you wo n't be able to open . Let me find out about that place from this friend of mine . He starts to go over to the phone . p. 97 SALLY The phone 's cut off . ( A knock at the door . ) See who it is , will you , Arthur ? Arthur goes over and opens the door for Signe . She carries a cash-box under her arm . ARTHUR Hello , Signe . SIGNE Oh , hello , Arthur ! I have n't seen you for ages !  --  Hello , Sally : how are you ? SALLY All right , I guess . ARTHUR ( to Sally ) . I 'll go out and call up about that and then come back . SALLY No , do n't : stay here now ! You can do it when we go out later . SIGNE Yes , stay here , Arthur : I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . All I 've got to offer you is gin . I have n't even got ginger ale . She goes over to the closet and gets out a couple of tumblers and a bottle of gin about half full . SIGNE Just give me a little straight . She takes off her coat and sits down on the couch . SALLY How are things at the theater ? She pours out a slug and gives it to Signe , then looks at Arthur , who nods . She pours out two more shots . p. 98 SIGNE Not so good . SALLY What 's the matter ? SIGNE The same old situation , only worse . Harry and Sophie have combined again , and they 're working against Dan and me . They want to revive Uncle Tom and do it in an uptown theater . ( She tosses off the gin . ) SALLY I thought we 'd fought that all out . SIGNE They 're threatening to do it on their own . SALLY How can they if the rest of us stand out against it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting demoralized . I ca n't get anybody to talk any sense . Dan 's tight , and Fred 's tight  --  and Fred believes he 's the Messiah , so he 's no use at all any more . Harry has been telling everybody that the trouble is all my fault , because I 've been mismanaging the finances . SALLY What a worm Harry is ! SIGNE Of course the actors have n't been paid for four weeks . But then I have n't been paid for six and neither has Dan . ARTHUR Harry Greenaway 's a terrible type : he 's the professionally affable guy who gets to be class secretary at college . SIGNE He 's completely lost faith in Dan since Keith Mitchell 's play 's done so badly , and Sophie is sore because she got bad notices . p. 99 SALLY She would n't let Dan direct her . SIGNE I know it : there ought to be a rule in little theaters that every member of the group has to sleep with the same person all season . A knock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIGNE ( to Sally ) . Bugs Brophy has n't come back yet ? SALLY I do n't know . ARTHUR ( at the door ) . Hello , Tracy . Tracy comes in . SALLY You 're still with us , are n't you , Tracy ? TRACY What do you mean ? SALLY You have n't joined the Greenaway faction ? TRACY Oh , no : certainly not . But I 'm afraid I 'm leaving the theater altogether . SALLY What do you mean , Tracy ? TRACY I 'm getting married . SALLY Why , Tracy ? SIGNE You ought n't to spring a thing like that on us right out of a clear sky ! TRACY It happened very suddenly . p. 100 SALLY Who is it , Tracy ? SIGNE Tell us ! TRACY A girl named Dianthe Sayre . You do n't know her : I only met her last week myself . ARTHUR I know her : but I did n't know she was the marrying kind . TRACY She 's not : this is merely a friendly arrangement . She wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family , being stuffy , wo n't let her travel alone  --  so she has to do this to get away . I 'm going to spend the summer in the other girl 's villa at Villefranche while they take a trip to the Congo . He sits down in a chair on the left of the day-bed . SALLY Why , Tracy ! A villa at Villefranche is the only thing you 've needed to make you perfect ! TRACY You must all come over and see me . SALLY But what are we going to do without you ? TRACY I 'm sorry : I do n't want to desert you , but I 've been knocking about like this for so long , leading this Bohemian life , that it 's high time I settled down to some kind of respectable existence . SIGNE You 'll just be being kept , Tracy ! TRACY Not at all : I 'll have to work extremely hard  --  I 'll have to spend the whole summer writing letters from Dianthe to her family , telling about our life together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their limit . Fred 's knock at the door . p. 101 SALLY Come in , Fred ! FRED ( bursting in ) . Hello , Sally ! Hello , Signe ! Hello , Tracy ! Hello , Arthur !  --  What do you think : I 've got a convert to my religion ! ARTHUR This is a day of great good fortune for everybody ! SIGNE Who 's your convert , Fred ? FRED The little newsdealer on the corner : he 's very much interested in my booklet ! ARTHUR He ca n't read English , can he ? FRED Damn it , Arthur ! my religion 's for the ignorant as well as for the lettered ! ARTHUR What is your new religion ? FRED Give me a drink , Arthur , and I 'll tell you ! Arthur pours Fred a drink , then looks at Tracy . ARTHUR Tracy ? TRACY Yes , thanks . Arthur hands the drinks . In the meantime , the other conversation goes on . SIGNE I thought Harry was keeping you in drinks , Fred . SALLY You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon have to be withdrawing from the theater , Sally , because the influence of my religion is being felt , and people will be coming to me , and I 'll have to get away !  --  p. 102 ARTHUR What is your doctrine , Fred ? FRED Why , it 's absolutely new , Arthur ! It 's a completely new religion I 've created !  --  there 's never been anything like it ! All the religions of the past have either mortified the flesh in the interests of the spirit or have stinted the spirit in the interests of the flesh : and this is the first religion in history that has promoted the highest development of the spirit and at the same time facilitated the ecstasies of the flesh ! ARTHUR That sounds like a wonderful arrangement . FRED There 's never been anything like it , Arthur ! and when people begin to find out about it , I 'm going to have to go away because I do n't want to have to manage a big religious movement ! I 'm going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert and live there in dignity and simplicity  --  and if people come out there to see me , they 'll just find me there in the desert , and I 'll just tell them what I know patiently and simply and sincerely !  --  ARTHUR I 'm afraid they 'll be wearing a track to your door . FRED I 'll just talk to them simply as I 'm talking to you . No thaumaturgy ! no signs and wonders !  --  no healing the sick or loaves and fishes !  --  though I really have a sort of a mesmeric gift which might make it possible for me to do some of those things  --  you know , I really feel sometimes , Arthur , as if I did have a sort of an occult power !  --  I used to hypnotize Marcella , you know  --  when we were first married , that is  --  I was n't able to later on , because she 'd oppose her will to mine .  --  But sometimes I 've actually felt as if I could make the crippled walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  And yet I know it 's wrong !  --  I must n't do it !  --  my religion must succeed without miracles !  --  it must impose itself upon people through its inherent divine harmony !  --  and I sometimes think that my supernatural power must come from some evil Demiurge who is trying to get possession of me !  --  Would n't it be terrible if some malignant Demiurge should secretly enter into me and compel me to perform miracles of black magic  --  and if I should become drugged with power and allow all my influence for good to be turned into an influence for evil !  --  if I should use my extra-human powers just to make people give me money and compel women to yield to me !  --  Would n't that be terrible !  --  and yet sometimes I feel , when my evil Demiurge comes muttering in my ear , that it might really happen if I do n't look out ! ( He picks up the gin bottle. )  --  Do you mind if I finish this , Sally ? p. 103 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his name is Harry Greenaway ! FRED Harry wants to put on my miracle-play , Signe  --  and you and Dan scoff at it and want me to emasculate it . Yet my play Don Juan at Bethlehem is an integral part of my religion : it 's a symbol of the flesh and the spirit ! SALLY You know very well , Fred , that this religion of yours is just an alibi for fear your new play wo n't pan out ! The last play you wrote , you had prize-fighting for an alibi , and you nearly got yourself killed . FRED Yes , there 's danger ! there 's danger !  --  The Theosophists will be wild !  --  they may try to do me physical violence !  --  I may become a martyr to my own religion ! ARTHUR It 's much better to have other people be the martyrs . FRED You rogues : you do n't take me seriously !  --  but I 'll drink with you just the same !  --  He sits down on the window-seat . Dan Frink comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan . ARTHUR ( coming to shake hands with him ) . Hello , Dan . DAN ( shaking hands but not paying much attention to him : he has been drinking ) . Hello , Arthur .  --  ( Addressing himself to Sally ) I 'm going to have a real Acropolis !  --  Smithy is going to build one on the stage  --  and when you make your great speech about war , you 'll seem to be standing on the peak of the world ! He sits down at Sally 's right on the edge of the day-bed . Sally has moved back and put pillows behind her . Signe is sitting on the edge at her left . p. 104 SIGNE Is it going to cost any more money ? DAN No : he 's going to make it out of old lumber . But I want a concrete dome for the sky , Signe ! I ca n't get the deep blue I want with an ordinary canvas backdrop . SIGNE Do n't talk about concrete domes ! We 'll barely make the grade as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . The actors have n't been paid for four weeks  --   --  FRED We got paid today , Signe . SIGNE What do you mean ? You did n't get paid . FRED Harry paid us . SIGNE Harry paid you ? Where did he get the money ? FRED I do n't know , but he paid us a week 's salary . SIGNE What ? ( To Dan ) Did you know about this ? DAN Not a word . SIGNE That just shows you how things are going ! Harry has no right to pay salaries without consulting us . I had to go uptown this afternoon , and I left him and Sophie in the box-office , and they just took advantage of my being away .  --  I 'll bet they used the gate ! ( She takes a key out of her purse and opens the cash-box in her lap . ) They 've taken all the cash ! p. 105 DAN Is it empty ? SIGNE There 's a few pennies and nickels ! DAN Well , this means just one thing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own salaries and let them go . We 'll have it out with them tonight . SIGNE We ca n't pay them . We 've got practically nothing in the bank . How could they have paid a week 's salary , Fred ? We could n't have taken that much in . Were there many in the house this afternoon ? FRED The house was a gaping void , Signe  --  but Harry must have got hold of some money , because he offered to pay the cast every week if they 'd come uptown with Uncle Tom 's Cabin . SIGNE What ! FRED The actors have got to live , Signe ! I 've been absolutely destitute myself ! I 've had to exert all my personal magnetism to prevent my Hogarthian landlady from hurling me into the street . If I had n't talked to her about my religion  --   --  SIGNE Oh , forget your religion , Fred ! Why did n't you tell us about this ? FRED I thought you knew about it , Signe . He called the whole cast together and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 106 FRED What it came down to , Dan , was that we could come uptown with him and get paid or stay down here and work for nothing . SIGNE And you were ready to go , I suppose ? FRED I was going to talk to you and Dan about it , Signe . SIGNE And were the rest of them ready to go ? FRED They were debating it . SIGNE Where did he get the money ? TRACY From Eddie Applebaum , I imagine . He 's the person who 's been egging Harry on . DAN Very good : we end the group today !  --  and we organize another group with nobody we ca n't depend on ! We 'll start again from scratch ! SIGNE We 've done that so many times already ! DAN There 's no reason we should n't do it every year ! Let Harry go about his business . When he came to us , he was a second-line dramatic critic on a second-rate evening paper . Let him be a second-rate producer ! SIGNE What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ? DAN Some of them will stick with us  --  and besides , there are always plenty of actors  --  get them off the streets  --  that 's the best way  --  the way the Abbey Theater did !  --  They talk about a bigger theater !  --  Why , what we need is a smaller theater ! How about that room above Scarlatti 's ? p. 107 TRACY Scarlatti 's not going to have that place next year . SIGNE No : his landlord has played him a dirty trick : he 's let him increase the value of the place by making all kinds of improvements , and now he 's going to turn him out and get a higher rent for it . TRACY It seems that the Village landlords are making a practice of that  --  and if you ca n't live cheaply down here , there 's no point in living here at all . SALLY ( scornfully ) . You and your rich Lesbian ! ARTHUR Why do n't you get Dianthe Sayre to put up a little money for the Beech Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid I do n't know her well enough yet . ARTHUR Speaking of Scarlatti 's , Sally , how about a little dinner ? SALLY I do n't want to go out now , Arthur : I think we ought to talk about the theater . ARTHUR ( rather pleased with the situation and knowing that the others will have to go presently on account of the evening performance ) . All right . Suppose I go out and get some sandwiches . SALLY Yes , why do n't you do that ? p. 108 FRED And some gin , Arthur ! Get some gin ! ARTHUR ( to Sally ) . What would you like ? SALLY Oh , let me see !  --  Chicken and tomato , I guess . ARTHUR O.K. He puts on his hat and coat and goes out . FRED Listen , Dan : I 'll tell you what to do ! I 'll tell you how we can get a theater cheaply !  --  Rent a haunted house !  --  ( To Arthur ) Do n't forget the gin ! DAN Why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? FRED Because the rents on haunted houses are always low !  --  they 're glad to have people live in them !  --  I lived in a haunted house once , down on Minetta Lane : the Italians would n't live in it , but I lived in it ! SALLY Did you see any ghosts ? FRED ( springing to his feet ) . Let me tell you about it !  --  There was supposed to have been a murder committed there . An Italian girl who 'd lived in the house was engaged to be married to a man  --  the story was he 'd knocked her up and did n't want to marry her . So on the day when the wedding was to have taken place , instead of marrying her , he came and stabbed her  --  and her ghost is still supposed to be seen there in the white wedding veil and the wreath of flowers , saying , " Ahim ! Ay di me ! Santa Maria ! " ( He impersonates the ghost . ) Well , I took a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living there , so actually I had the whole house . The first night or two nothing happened  --  I simply sat there writing and nothing happened . Then one night I was lying in bed reading  --   --  Signe has begun to weep , and Sally interrupts Fred to speak to her . p. 109 SALLY Oh , do n't , Signe dear ! SIGNE I 'm sorry ! She dries her eyes . DAN Do n't worry about the theater , Signe ! What can those small-souled people do to us ? FRED ( who has paused momentarily ) .  --  I was lying in bed one evening reading Ariosto in the Italian , and I heard a sound like people talking , and so I  --   --  SALLY ( coming forward on the day-bed and putting her arm around Signe ) . Now , do n't , my dear ! SIGNE I 'm sorry  --  I 'm tired , I guess  --  and I had a letter from Ilya today . TRACY What does Ilya say ? I have n't heard much about him since he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? SIGNE He 's left . He did n't like Russia . TRACY Yes : it 's no place for Anarchists , I understand  --  the Communists hate ' em worse than they do the bourgeoisie . FRED So I was lying in bed in this house reading Ariosto in Italian  --  and I heard what sounded like people talking Italian  --  and I thought right away that it sounded like Italians jabbering at an Italian wedding ! p. 110 SIGNE Say what you like about the Anarchists , Tracy , they had something that we have n't got now and that we need ! SALLY I know : Tom Brophy had that  --  he 'd do things and would n't give a damn ! SIGNE It was n't only that they did n't give a damn : they had loyalty among themselves . They 'd bump off members of the ruling-class , but they would n't double-cross one another . The people who are outside it all have enough odds against them as it is . They 've got to be able to depend on one another . DAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in this room ! SIGNE You were n't square with Sophie Feinburg , Dan . If you had been , this might never have happened : Harry would never have had the initiative to go ahead with this by himself . DAN Certain emotions ca n't be policed . The Anarchists certainly did n't think so . SIGNE No : I know they did n't . Ilya 's living with another woman already . DAN Did he write you that ? SIGNE Yes . She begins to cry again . FRED Listen , Signe  --  listen to this story  --  it will take your mind away from your troubles !  --  I heard this sound of people talking  --  and the idea suddenly came to me that it sounded like the guests at the wedding !  --  the guests at the wedding of this Italian girl who 'd been murdered by her lover who did n't love her !  --  p. 111 SALLY Long stories make people nervous , Fred . SIGNE I 'm sorry to be so silly . I 've never been like this before ! SALLY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take another drink and you 'll feel better .  --  Give her another drink , Dan ! Dan obeys . SIGNE Well , you ca n't have the whole of love and the whole of revolution at the same time . And that applies to us , too : you ca n't have the whole of love and the whole of art both . The trouble has been with us down here that we 've tried to have the whole of everything . DAN Why should n't we , Signe ? SIGNE Because it 's as much as anybody can do to have anywhere near the whole of anything . DAN If we are whole ourselves , we can have everything whole ! TRACY That 's just metaphysical piffle , Dan ! SIGNE Well , it 's a good thing as far as the theater goes anyway , because I 'd been intending to draw some of my back pay and go over to Europe to see him , and now there 's no reason for my going , so I wo n't need to draw on the treasury . SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 112 SIGNE I 'm sorry to have behaved like this !  --  I 've never done it before . Dan takes her hand . He and Sally are sitting on either side of her . DAN You 've got it coming to you , my dear  --  you 've been working harder than any of us . You 've worked your head off raising money , and you 've given us a kind of moral support that nobody else could have done . It 's you who 's kept us up : without you , we could never have done anything .  --  Here 's to Signe ! Let 's drink to her : ( raising his glass ) the mainstay , the genius , the darling ! Let 's all drink to Signe , who 's given us her strength and her brains and her enthusiasm and her love ! ( He kisses her . ) Drink to Signe ! ( They drink . ) SIGNE I 'm very much obliged . I wish I had all those things to give . FRED Listen , Signe : the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just now as I was walking in University Place ! You may not have noticed it yet  --  but I have a peculiar sensitivity to the seasons , and today as I was walking in University Place staring down at the pavement ( he acts it out )  --  trudging along sullenly as one does in these dull leaden days  --  suddenly I felt a sort of lightness ! ( he illustrates , rather like an acrobat skipping after a difficult feat ) as if the darkness and weight of winter had lifted . I looked up , and there was the street full of slush and the clanging clanking car-tracks  --  the ugly old city seemed just as subterranean , just as fuliginous , as ever !  --  the air was still tarnished with February ! But some message from the summer had reached me !  --  from that moment I believed in the summer !  --  I knew that we 'd soon be hearing the melodious murmur of boat-whistles , that we 'd soon be drinking wine out of doors ; I believed in the resurrection of spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signe !  --  because when the spring arrives , the heart becomes whole again ! p. 113 SALLY That 's beautiful , Fred .  --  I hope it 's true ! FRED Of course it 's true  --  everything I say is true ! ( As he pours himself another drink ) Gosh , I 'll have to stop drinking when my religion begins to take hold ! If I got caught in any outrageous escapade , how the sensation-mongers would pounce on it ! I can see the headlines in the papers : " MESSIAH IN DRUNKEN BRAWL " ! Tracy has picked up the guitar and begun to strum it . SIGNE Yes , sing something , Tracy , do ! She gets up and goes over to the dressing table and freshens her face and arranges her hair . When she comes back , she sits down near the fireplace . Tracy sings , and while he is singing , a knock is heard at the door . Sally gets up and answers it . It is a telegram : the boy asks whether Miss Sally Voight lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs the slip , takes the telegram and opens it . Fred goes over and stretches out on the window-seat and immediately goes to sleep . He breathes heavily and soon begins snoring . TRACY ( singing ) Oh , love ! oh , love ! oh , careless love ! Oh , love ! oh , love ! oh , careless love ! You break de heart of many a gal  --  You never break dis heart of mine ! Oh , when I wore my apron low , You 'd follow me through rain or snow.But now I wear it to my chin , You 'll pass my door and not come in ! Sally comes back . p. 114 SIGNE No bad news ? SALLY No . ( She shows her the telegram . ) Do n't sing that , Tracy : I 'm tired of it . TRACY What shall I sing ? SALLY You might sing something amusing . She lights a cigarette . A silence , into which Arthur breaks , coming back with two paper bags , from one of which the necks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ginger ale for the thirsty . SALLY There 's nothing to do , I guess , but get tight ! ARTHUR It 's horrible outside : it 's sleeting . In setting the bags on the table , he lets one topple off on the floor . TRACY Oh , oh ! SALLY That was n't the gin ? ARTHUR ( picking it up ) . No : the sandwiches . ( Smiling a little bleakly , as he tries to enter into the spirit of the company ) I 'm tight myself , I guess . I had a couple of drinks while I was waiting at that bootlegger 's . DAN I 'm surprised at you , Arthur : I did n't know you ever lost your equilibrium ! p. 115 ARTHUR I occasionally make an ass of myself just the same way that you do , Dan . He busies himself with the sandwiches and drinks . DAN Your whole way of life makes an ass of you . When you put on that stiff collar in the morning , you 're assuming the badge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually wear a soft one !  --  Tracy and Signe talk together , tactfully withdrawing from the conversation . They are evidently discussing songs : Tracy hums tunes and twangs his guitar . SALLY Dan and Arthur : you 're both asses ! I wo n't have you being hateful to one another . If it 's on my account , you might just as well be nice , because I do n't belong to either of you ! We 're all independent people , and the Greenaways have n't got us yet ! We may not have the whole of everything , but we 've got something precious at this moment  --  we 've got this room and this gin and these sandwiches , and we 've got each other 's very agreeable company ! Arthur and Dan , I adore you both ! DAN I 'm sorry , Arthur : I did n't mean to be invidious . I used to be the damnedest ass imaginable myself . I used to be a college instructor in a great big stiff white collar about twice the size of yours ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frink may have taken in bad part , and offer him a liver-wurst sandwich  --  or would you rather have chicken or cheese ? p. 116 DAN ( taking it ) . Thank you . ARTHUR Here 's your chicken and tomato , Sally . ( As he hands it to her , he looks at the money order in her lap . ) You got a wire ? SALLY Yes : some money . ARTHUR Fifty dollars wo n't go far ! SALLY It 's all I need . ARTHUR I called up about that place I told you about . SALLY I 'll be all right . Never mind . ARTHUR You 're taking a terrible chance . SALLY You must n't read my telegrams . ARTHUR I could n't help seeing it . ( Going over to Signe ) . What will you have , Signe ? SIGNE ( still a little maudlin ) . Anything , Arthur  --  it does n't matter . ARTHUR Chicken and ham ? He gives her one . SIGNE It was nice of you to get these , Arthur ! ARTHUR Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Thank you . Arthur looks around and goes over to Fred on the window-seat . p. 117 SIGNE ( to Sally ) . Well , cheerio !  --  fifty dollars for death and not a nickel for art ! SALLY That 's all right : they have n't got us yet ! ARTHUR Hey , Fred !  --  how about a sandwich ? He shakes Fred gently by the shoulder . FRED ( waking up ) . Hello , Arthur ! Did you bring the gin ? The spring is coming , Arthur ! ( He sits up on the window-seat . ) Spring is coming to the Village ! There it lies , all fuliginous and tarnished  --  but it 's going to look just the same again as it did when I first met Marcella ! We 'll be waking up soon again to the glory of Greenwich Village mornings , with the windows wide open and the streets wide open and life wide open before us ! He begins to recite Keats , acting it out . He loves English poetry and reads it well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon they awoke clear-eyed : nor burned with thirsting , Nor with hot fingers , nor with temples bursting:And springing up , they met the wondering sightOf their dear friends , nigh foolish with delight , Who feel their arms , and breasts , and kiss , and stare , And on their placid foreheads part the hair.Young men and maidens at each other gazed , With hands held back , and motionless , amazedTo see the brightness in each other 's eyes ; And so they stood , fill 'd with a sweet surprise , Until their tongues were loosed in poesy.Therefore no lover did of anguish die:But the soft numbers , in that moment spoken , Made silken ties , that never may be broken . " p. 118 ARTHUR ( after a moment 's silence ) @x April : a fine morning , sun from the windows on the window-seat . Arthur and Sally come in . She is pale and weak , and he is supporting her . ARTHUR ( helping her off with her things ) . How do you feel ? SALLY I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs ? SALLY ( sitting down on the day-bed ) . A little : not much . ARTHUR You 'd better lie down . SALLY No : I 'm all right . She gets out a cigarette , which he lights for her . ARTHUR You lost an awful lot of blood , you know . SALLY Yes : I suppose I did . ARTHUR The doctor told me that it was a very lucky thing that I got you to the hospital when I did . SALLY You 've been very sweet . He kisses her . ARTHUR I ought to go to the office for a little while . Will you be all right alone ? SALLY Yes , of course : I 'm afraid you 've been neglecting your work . You must n't bother about me anymore . p. 120 ARTHUR Oh , I can always get away .  --  Well , I 'll go now and be back at lunch-time  --  ( glancing at his watch ) about twelve . SALLY Why do you bother to come way down here ? ARTHUR You 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go to the Brevoort ; if you do n't , I 'll bring something in . SALLY I 'll go out .  --  ( Smiling ) I 'd like some Eggs Benedict  --  I kept thinking about Eggs Benedict in the hospital . ARTHUR Fine : we 'll go to the Brevoort.  --  Well . goodby , sweet . ( He kisses her . ) If you should want anything , call me . This is the number . ( He takes an envelope from his pocket and writes it down . ) Your phone 's working now . SALLY Is it ?  --  Did you pay the bill ? ARTHUR Yes .  --  Look : will you think about something ?  --  if you feel as if you could think about anything . SALLY ( smiling ) . What ? ARTHUR About  --  what we talked about the day you came back from the doctor . SALLY About getting married ? p. 121 ARTHUR Yes . SALLY ( smiling ) . Yes : I 'll think about it . ( She puts a slight emphasis on " think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . SALLY Goodby . ARTHUR ( on his way to the door ) . It 's a beautiful day to come out of the hospital . Why do n't you lie over on the window-seat in the sun ? SALLY Yes , it is beautiful . ( She remains where she is . Arthur goes out . She is about to stretch out on the day-bed when the telephone rings : she gets up and answers it . ) Oh . hello , Dan ! Yes , I just got back I 'm fine . I 'm so anxious to talk about the play . Yes : I 'm perfectly all right ! Yes , come over . ( She hangs up the receiver and goes to touch up her make-up in the mirror . A knock at the door : she goes to open it . It is a shock to see Bugs outside , and she hesitates as to how to receive him : ) Oh  --  hello . BUGS Hello ! ( He puts his arms around her and kisses her : he is a little constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 122 SALLY Yes . Bugs has been transformed : he is wearing a well-pressed blue business-suit , a black derby , a stiff white collar and well-polished shoes . He is carrying a spring overcoat . BUGS I did n't hear from you  --  I did n't know what had happened to you ! SALLY I 'm all right . BUGS I called here twice on my way through and could n't find you  --  I left a note . SALLY Yes : I got it . BUGS You 're out of your jam all right ? SALLY Yes . BUGS I was sorry I could n't send you more money  --  but I had to pay debts to make Gracie feel better , and then I 'd used up most of the rest on the trip . SALLY That was enough . I got along all right .  --  What did you go out West for ? BUGS Immoral purposes . Do n't ask ! SALLY ( smiling ) . What was it ? BUGS Ghost-writing for a prominent motor king for a prominent five-cent weekly . SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 123 BUGS This is the uniform ! SALLY Why , you look like a capitalist ! BUGS It 's my funniest act . You ought to see me come into an office ! For everybody except the king-pins , I keep the dip on , see ! All office-workers are poltroons , and all you have to do to impress them is to come in and talk emphatically . SALLY Is it interesting out there ? BUGS It 's colossal ! It 's the technological masterpiece of the world ! Of course , humanly , it 's hell on earth ; but I concentrate on the technological side . SALLY I see . BUGS I decided that , instead of sulking in a secondrate newspaper office , I might just as well get in on some of the good things that are going . Why should the muckers get all the dough when I can spend it so much more intelligently ? The radical movement 's dead  --  and somebody 's got to ghost-write the old motor magician.  --  It 's really a hell of an exciting story ! SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar way , he 's a genius . SALLY Is he ? BUGS He has qualities of actual greatness  --  so that the job 's worth doing for its own sake .  --  And it 's a life-save for me , because it gets me out of debt and out of Flushing p. 124 SALLY Yes : that 's fine .  --  Where are you going ? BUGS I 've taken a place at Great Neck . SALLY Yes : that will be pleasanter , I suppose . BUGS I 've got to do something about Gracie and the kids , and I 'll be happier about them if they 're happier .  --  But what about you ?  --  How 's the work ? SALLY I 'm going to be in Lysistrata  --  we start rehearsa tomorrow . BUGS See here , Sally : why not take a couple of week off and come away with me for awhile ? I 'm free , because Gracie thinks I 'm still in the West , and you need a vacation , I can see it . I 've got money now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 've got to start rehearsing . BUGS ( taking her hands ) . I have a desperate need to see you ! All the time I was out in the West , in exile among those inchoate creatures , I 'd keep thinking , Sally Voight still exists , and I 'm going to see her again ! SALLY ( yielding to his charm again ) . Did you ? BUGS What 's a month of stone and concrete and conveyor-belts and goddamned hypocrisy if it buys a few moments of freedom and joy ? That 's all we can get our of this world  --  a few free and happy moments  --  and we 're fools not to pay the price for it ! A knock at the door . p. 125 SALLY Come in . Dan enters . DAN Hello , Sally . Hello , Bugs . ( They greet him ; he takes Sally 's hands . ) How are you ? SALLY I 'm splendid now  --  I 've felt terribly about holding up the play . DAN I hope you wo n't be terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but I 'm afraid we are n't going to be able to do it . I 've just been talking to Signe about it , and the loss of funds and break-up of the company seem to make it pretty impossible . That does n't mean we wo n't do it later ! SALLY You think it 's completely impossible ! DAN I 'm afraid so .  --  You 're not really well yet , besides . ( Bugs looks at her . ) And for that part you ought to have all your strength . SALLY I 'm all right now , I really am  --  I 'm perfectly well able to do it . I was counting on it . I sha n't know what to do with myself ! BUGS ( to Sally ) . I made a suggestion , you know . ( Dan looks at him. )  --  Well , you and Dan want to talk theater , and I must go along . Why do n't you have dinner with me tonight and we can talk about that other matter ? p. 126 SALLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 7 . SALLY All right . BUGS Well , goodby for the present ! He briskly picks up his coat and waves his derby and goes . DAN What in God 's name has happened to Bugs Brophy ? He looks like a high-pressure bond-salesman . SALLY Yes : he 's turned into a go-getter . DAN You love him still , do n't you ? SALLY ( after a moment 's pause ) . Yes .  --  Poor Bugs ! DAN He 's caught in his trap , is n't he ? just the way you said that night ? He 'll never be able to get away . SALLY Not for lone . DAN He can only pretend he 's free ; and he does n't really want to be free or he would be . It 's all more or less of a fake with him , and he has to keep finding new people who have n't found out yet it 's a fake . When you 've found him out , he 'll get somebody else . SALLY I 've always felt that Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality .  --  But then . you do that for all of us. p. 127 SALLY Do I ? ( Smiling ) Maybe that 's why I feel so tired . DAN People exist through you , Sally  --  you create them . Look at Arthur : you 've made something like a genuine person out of a pair of spectacles and a pressed suit . SALLY ( smiling ) . Arthur 's not so bad as that . He 's really a fine person .  --  Arthur wants to marry me . DAN But do you want to marry Arthur ? SALLY I do n't think so . But what you say about my doing things for people may be true to some extent of Arthur : he wants me to make up for some lack in himself . DAN And you need all of yourself for the theater . If you marry him , he 'll take it all !  --  Why do n't you come up to Woodstock with me , Sally ? As long as we ca n't do Lysistrata , I 'm going to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it together up there . SALLY You 're simply going to close the theater ? DAN It looks as if that was all we could do . SALLY It seems a pity we ca n't last the season . DAN I 'm afraid it 's out of the question . Tracy 's getting married and sailing next week  --  and Fred says he 's going away , too . He says he 's discovered the real Arcadia : the St. Pierre Islands . p. 128 SALLY What are they ? DAN They 're off the coast of Canada , it seems  --  and the thing about them , according to Fred , is that they bring you wine in milk-bottles every morning . SALLY ( laughing ) . Why is that an advantage ? I 'd rather have my wine in wine-bottles . DAN I suppose it gives you a reason to start in drinking at dawn . SALLY The kind of place I 'd like to go to would be somewhere very clean where nobody drinks at all  --  except maybe a little at dinner ! DAN We could lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sun ourselves and study . I 've got a fine little house on a hill . I 'll cook all the meals so that you can rest . I 'm an excellent cook , you know . SALLY ( smiling ) . Are you really ? You evidently remember my omelet ! DAN We 'll live with the grass and the stones and the stars  --  we 'll forget about Harry Greenaway and his Tom show , and we 'll make plans for our next season . SALLY But you know I love somebody else . DAN Love whom you please : we both love the theater ! p. 129 SALLY Oh , Dan ! you 're the only one of them all who wants to give people something for nothing ! And you can keep on doing it because you 're a man , but I 'm a woman and sometimes I feel that I 'd like to have other people give me things for once  --  women are supposed to be given certain things . DAN You 're an artist , and you 're not an artist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SALLY Yes , I know  --  and I suppose that what that really means is that I 'm no good at real roles in life . In that way I 'm something like Bugs  --  I 'm only good at putting on a show . ( A knock ) Come in . Arthur enters . ARTHUR Hello , Dan . ( To Sally ) How are you ? SALLY ( smiling ) . Fine . ARTHUR Well , are you ready for your Eggs Benedict ?  --  I came back a little early because I thought you might be hungry . SALLY You know , I am rather hungry . She goes behind the screen to make up , Dan and Arthur , left together , become covertly antagonistic . ARTHUR I just saw Signe outside , and she told me you were dropping Lysistrata. p. 130 DAN We 're going to do it next fall . ARTHUR It 's just as well , I think : Sally 's hardly strong enough yet . DAN We 'll be working on it during the summer . ARTHUR She ought to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up to Woodstock . ( As Sally reappears ) Well , Sally , I must be getting on . SALLY Come in again soon ! DAN You bet ! Dan goes out , gesturing farewell to Arthur . ARTHUR Goodby , Dan . ( Sally goes over to arrange her hat in the mirror . Arthur , pretty well satisfied with things , walks to the window and looks out . A man selling flowers is heard outside . ) There 's a man selling daffodils ! SALLY Oh , is there really ? ARTHUR I 'll buy you some . SALLY Do n't buy me anything more : you 've bought me too many things . ARTHUR Daffodils are no very great extravagance . SALLY Think of spring 's having arrived , after all ! ( She turns around from the mirror , smiling . ) There were moments when I thought they 'd given up the idea ! p. 131 ARTHUR ( as he helps her on with her coat ) . I 've got tickets for the Kneisel quartet tonight . We do n't have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you might like to hear some music . They 're playing one of Beethoven 's late quartets . SALLY I 'd love to hear it any other time , but I do n't think I want to do anything like that tonight . ARTHUR Very well : you do n't have to go out at all . I 'll bring dinner in to you here if you want . SALLY I 've made a sort of engagement for dinner . ARTHUR Oh . ( A tense pause : he stops , constrained . ) With Dan ? SALLY No . ARTHUR You did n't tell me . SALLY I did n't know then . She begins pulling on her gloves . ARTHUR You 've made the engagement since I saw you ? SALLY Yes . ARTHUR ( cold and dry ) . Well , are you ready ? SALLY Oh , do n't get grim about it !  --  I ca n't stand it ! ARTHUR It makes me feel grim . p. 132 SALLY Oh , do n't  --  everything 's horrid enough already ! I 'm nervous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that it 's unexpected : we talked about spending the evening together . SALLY I 'm sorry , but it 's somebody I 've got to see . ARTHUR I see .  --  I suppose I know who it is . SALLY ( sitting down on the day-bed ) . Oh , do n't !  --  you must n't always be checking up on me !  --  you make me feel so guilty all the time !  --  I 'm fond of you , you know that  --  but you do n't own me ! I 've still got a right to see whom I please  --  and to go where I please and do what I please ! ARTHUR ( sitting down beside her ) . I 'm sorry , but I get to feel as if you were married to me  --  SALLY But I 'm not ! ARTHUR But I feel as if you were  --  I ca n't help it  --  I love you  --  I feel as if I 'd grown together with you  --  and then when I find all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's as if half myself were cut away . I stagger around , feeling horribly , as if I 'd had some kind of amputation  --  without any anaesthetic . I know that you do n't understand that kind of feeling  --  p. 133 SALLY ( suddenly , bursting into tears ) . Oh , I do ! I do understand ! It 's horrible for me , too !  --  all these abortions and mutilations !  --  I 've been hurting you and killing your love every day that we 've been together ! Have you ever been happy with me a single moment ? ARTHUR Yes : a great many . SALLY So have I been with you  --  but I 've been hurt myself ! ARTHUR Yes : I know it . SALLY You 've given me something that nobody else has  --  you 've given me a kind of repose . But people have to fight against relaxing  --  ARTHUR You 've got to have some relaxation . SALLY And when I fight it , you 're always there and you have to take all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I love you for . SALLY You must n't think that I do n't care about you !  --  I do care about you  --  deeply ! He puts his arms around her and kisses her ; a long silence . The hurdy-gurdy strikes up outside , playing the same tunes as the autumn before . ARTHUR ( releasing her enough to speak ) . Why do n't you marry me ? p. 134 SALLY I do n't know I do n't think  --  ARTHUR Why do n't you ? SALLY I do n't know how it would be  --  ARTHUR It would be fine ! SALLY It might be nice . ARTHUR It would be perfectly wonderful . Will you ? SALLY I do n't know  --  maybe  --  ARTHUR You will , wo n't you ? Say yes . SALLY All right . He kisses her . ARTHUR I 'll look for an apartment right away . How would you like to live in the Judson ? SALLY I told you last fall , do you remember ? that you wanted to get me into an apartment house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorman can be a very useful thing : he can keep away the wolves and the bar-flies.  --  Gee , that 's come just at the right moment , has n't it ? SALLY What do you mean ? ARTHUR The organ-grinder . SALLY Oh , yes . ARTHUR Do you remember I said last fall that I could n't hear the hurdy-gurdy when I was with you , because everything then was so wrong ? Well , I can hear it now distinctly , and it seems to me perfectly marvelous ! p. 135 SALLY Can you , dear ?  --  Do you remember how you gave him some money , and he made one short spurt and then stopped ?  --  ( Standing up suddenly ) Well , let 's go out to lunch ; I 'm hungry . ( He stands up. )  --  You can hear it , but now I ca n't hear it . ARTHUR Why ca n't you ? What do you mean ? SALLY Why  --  ( she pauses , then thinks how to put it )       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
