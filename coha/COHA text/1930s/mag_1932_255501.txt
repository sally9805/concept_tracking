YOUNG WOMAN OF 1914-Arnold Zweig - Viking ( $2.50 ) . . <P> German authors like to give themselves plenty of room . Good German Author Arnold Zweig* herewith puts out the first volume of his War epic . Volumes 2 and 4 ( Education before Verdun , The Crowning of a King ' ) are still to come . Volume 3 is the already-published The Case of Sergeant Grischa , one of the few good War books , often compared with the world-best-selling All Quiet on the Western Front , sometimes preferred to it . <P> Readers of Sergeant Grischa will remember Hero Bertin as the intellectual military clerk whose sympathy for Grischa was horrified , heartfelt and ineffectual . Here Bertin is shown in palmier days . At the outbreak of the War he was a pale but ambitious youth , a promising author with no money , living in blissful sin in Berlin with Lenore Wahl . Her family , rich Potsdam bankers , looked down their noses at Bertin , not because he was a Jew ( they were that too ) but because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Junkers , whom they worshipped . Unbeknownst to her parents , lovely Lenore called frequently at Bertin 's shabby room ; they considered themselves modern and happy . Then came August 1914 , mobilization , breakup . After Lenore came home from a visit to Bertin 's camp she found she was pregnant . Things being what they were and Bertin and herself too young to know better , there was nothing for it but an abortion . Luckily her parents were away on a holiday , her young brother David was man enough to make the arrangements . But she had to go through it all without Bertin ; for that she could not forgive him . When he was shifted to the Western Front , to the lethal chamber of Verdun , Lenore was hardly sorry . Then she discovered she loved him still . To her astonishment her parents changed their minds about the Junkers , about Bertin too . By a lot of management , a little luck , she got her man home for a four-day leave , married him good &; proper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she loved him . <P> The Author-Arnold Zweig is one of the postWar , German-Jewish writers ( others : Lion Feuchtwanger , Emil Ludwig . Franz Werfel ) who have made present-day German letters something for smart U. S. publishers to conjure with . Professorial-looking , no friend of war , he was not raised to be a soldier but a professor . Some five universities , years of study in philosophy , languages . French and English literature , graduated him to pick &; shovel work in a Labor Corps . Like his hero Bertin he sweated his spectacles steamy in Macedonia , Serbia , northern France , spent 13 months at Verdun before he settled down on the Eastern Front . Now , with the help of his education , he is getting the War out of his system , hopes to have it all out by the end of 1933 . <P> <P> *Not to be confused with Austrian Author Stefan Zweig ( Conflicts , Amok , Joseph Fonch , Three Alastcrs ) , no kin .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
