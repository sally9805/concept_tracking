Red were the faces of several proud Manhattan bankers last week when they were exposed in Federal Court not for evil but for folly . In Judge William Bondy 's courtroom , Michael ( " Mike " ) Pecoraro , 39 , a confessed swindler with at least 19 aliases , received an 18-month penitentiary sentence for having obtained $15,563 in 19 different loans from the National City Bank and Manufacturers Trust Company on 19 pieces of real estate he did not own . <P> Because the Federal Housing Administration is a partial guarantor of modernization loans made by banks under Title I of the National Housing Act , Mike Pecoraro 's methods came under Federal scrutiny . His methods were simple . A short , smartly-dressed man with a police record as a forger and thief , Mike would walk into a branch of big National City or Manufacturers Trust , submit an FHA loan application signed by Otto Corneau ( or one of 18 other names ) with his right hand and the wife 's name penned with his left . Then he returned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone call regarding the loan . Thus ' ' investigated , " Mike hastened to substantiate the references he had given . Scurrying to a public telephone in a corner drugstore , he became his own employer when the bank made inquiries . " Yeah , ' ' Mike would tell the bank , " Otto Corneau works here . Makes 50 bucks a week . " All Mike had to do then was wait for the check , usually for $700 or $1,000 . <P> Most amazing of Mike 's activities were his return visits to two branches of National City where he had been successful . In each case he was interviewed by the same employe who had seen him before under a different name . He got four loans in four calls at two banks . <P> Mike was " Pasquale Cassotta " when special agents of FHA caught up with him last June at a mailbox waiting for a check . It was an anonymous letter from " A Citizen , " not the banks , which gave the Federal men their first knowledge of his activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South for the worst of the winter , resuming his bank calls in the spring . <P> Before sentencing Mike last week , Judge Bondy asked if he were sane . When the prosecutor pointed out that he got the money . Mike grinned . Snorted Judge Bondy : " Well , is the bank sane then ? . . . It 's incredible . "
