Last week Standard Statistics Co. , Inc. , world 's largest figure factory , estimated U. S. cigaret consumption for 1934 at an all-time new high of 125,000,000,000 . Many a cigaret smoker was surprised to find that conservatively advertised Chesterfield , with sales of 34,500,000,000 , had outsold garishly advertised Camel ( 33,800,000,000 ) and Lucky Strike ( 33,000,000,000 ) . Old Gold was a poor fourth with 5,500,000,000 . Total consumption of the leading four was up 8.4% from last year , but nearly 7,000,000,000 below the 1930 peak . Chief reason for this drop , according to Standard Statistics , was competition from 10 cigarets ( Paul Jones , Wings , etc. ) , mentholated brands ( Spud , Kool , etc. ) , and the Phillip Morris English Blend . <P> Most spectacular rise of the year was Camel , whose sales were pulled back to the 1931 level after the disastrous sales results of temporarily abandoning newspaper advertising in 1932 . Most spectacular setback was for Lucky Strike which lost 4,500,000,000 in sales .

" Whenever a single brand advances far ahead of the others , it eventually becomes the victim of a competitor 's advertising attack . This happened to Camel in 1929-31 and to Lucky Strike in 1933-34 . Aside from this generalization , it is futile to attempt to forecast sales of leading brands for any distance ahead . Particularly is it impossible to foresee the response of the millions of cigaret consumers to whatever new advertising appeals may be devised .

Reynolds Tobacco Co. made $21,536,000 , slightly more than in 1933 . Stockholders were pleased to learn that Reynolds ' directors had decided to continue the regular $3 dividend paid all during Depression . <P> Richard Joshua Reynolds chose the name Camel for the cigaret which revolutionized the tobacco industry because he liked animal names and because Camel was easy to pronounce . Before Camels were invented the U.S. was producing about ten billion cigarets a year , a large proportion Turkish . Leading domestic brands like Piedmont and Sweet Caporal were made of unblended Carolina leaf . The year Tobaccoman Reynolds launched his cigaret of blended domestic and Turkish tobacco ( 1913 ) , cigaret consumption leaped to fifteen and a half billion . He followed it up with a highly successful merchandising campaign , profited immensely by the amazing luck that fell to the tobacco industry during and after the nerve-racking years of the War .
