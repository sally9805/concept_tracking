" Unlike Taxes " <P> HELP THE FARMER SELL HIS SURPLUS CROP-PEA BEANS 3 Ibs. for 13 <P> In 37,000 chain stores all over the U. S. placards such as this appeared last week . Bean promotion appeared in newspaper advertisements , in radio blurbs , on roadside handbills . Some 200,000 well-drilled chain-store workers urged even illiterate housewives to buy jumbos , red kidneys , yellow eyes , chile or limas . This high pressure was no stunt . It was the latest application of a new economic device notably successful in its 15 previous tests . Its enthusiasts describe it as some-thing to put AAA to shame , for it works on the positive principle of reducing surpluses-not by reducing production but by increasing consumption . <P> The scheme goes back to 1935 when the California Chain Stores Association hired the big Chicago advertising agency of Lord &; Thomas to help it defeat a chain-store tax ( TIME , Nov. 9 , 1936 ) . Lord &; Thomas put young Theodore W. Braun on the job . Ted Braun had made something of a reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anti-chain-store-tax campaign , he taught California farmers that the chain stores were their customers and friends , and the tax was defeated . As part of Ted Braun 's anti-tax campaign , the National Association of Food Chains , represented by the heads of 16 large companies , sat down in May 1936 with representatives of the National Co-operative Council , an association of 51 agricultural co-operative groups with a membership of 1,500,000 farmers . Out of the meeting grew several policies , one of which was an agreement by the chain stores to stage special sales campaigns whenever the farmers were stuck with a bona fide surplus of any crop . <P> This had been tried locally by such stores as First National in Massachusetts and Safeway in California . But it had been attempted on a nation-wide scale for the first time only a month before the conference between farmers and chains . California cling peach growers found themselves with a carry over from 1935 of 6,469,000 cases of canned peaches , 72% more than the previous year . With a big 1936 crop impending , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , substantially less than the cost of production . Growers appealed to the chains . Ted Braun and National Association of Food Chains ' Vice President John A. Logan made careful but speedy preparations , and 34,000 chain stores staged a four-week peach ballyhoo . Sales jumped 171% over the same period for the year before , the carry over was cut to 1,929,000 cases ; the growers got $30 per ton for their 1936 crop . This success was largely responsible for persuading the chains to make such campaigns permanent policy . <P> Next plea came from cattlemen forced because of 1936 drought to sell their beef at any price . The July slaughter was 25% over the previous year and many a rancher faced ruin . But the chains , with the aid of numerous packers , put on sales pressure . Chain-store beef sales jumped 34% in August over August 1935 ; the price of choice steers rose from $8.58 in June to $10 in September ; cattlemen received more August income than the previous five-year average ; the Government had to buy only 5,000 head to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934.
