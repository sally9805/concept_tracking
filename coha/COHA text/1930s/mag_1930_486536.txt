SIR : Mr. Pickering , of Squashville , presents his compliments to " The First Alumnus " in the Nation , and requests that gentleman to be a little more careful in his representations about what people have said , and not to trouble himself or the public with the unimportant , and irrelevant ques  --  tion whether Mr. P. is or is not a " former editor of the Independent . " If everybody who thinks that the hebdomadal so-named is managed on the principle commended by Mr. W. W. Phelps as " an absolute condition of earthly success " ? the principle of " catering to human weakness and in. infirmity " ? must be incontinently set down as " a former editor , " the cata  --  logue of former editors will become inconveniently " - olundnous . That Mr. Pickering is " a clerical member of the corporation " can hardly be denied , for that fact was openly proclaimed by so eminent an authority as Mr. Phelps , in his speech at the commencement dinner , and is as openly professed on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That he is a " polemical " member may , perhaps , be inferred without any blamable temerity from the fact that , when the venerable body of which he is an unworthy member was publicly insulted by men professing to represent " Young Yale , " he volunteered to repel the insult . But the attempt to divert attention from the question by guessing which one of the ten clerical fellows accepted the insult for the rest , and replied to it , is as irrelevant and ( not to put too fine a point upon it ) as uncivil as if some one should attempt to guess out and publish the personality of " The First Alumnus " and the second . The intimation that the clerical fellows of Yale College , in declining to abdicate their trust and to put the institution afloat without any shadow of security for its continuing to be a Protestant Christian institution , oc  --  cupy a position like that of the Tract Society in Nassau Street a few years ago when it refused to publish a word against the vital godliness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selling her to the highest bidder  --  is too preposterous to be refuted . Has anybody pretended that this demand for the subversion of the entire constitution of Yale College is set up in the interest of Christian morality ? Is it pretended by " The First Alumnus " ? or even by the second  --  that the ancient charter , or the administration under it , is anti-Christian and offensive to the moral sense ? The strictures of the Evening Post not having come under Mr. Picker  --  ing 's notice , lie can not reply to them ; bat lie may say that he has not made Mr. Phelps responsible for either of the two writers in the Nation , nor " The First Alumnus " for the second . He had to do with a demand for what lie now finds denominated " a reform at Yale College " ? a de  --  mand made'in the name of " Young Yale . " He found " Young Yale " represented , and its demands articulated , first by Mr. Phelps , then by " The First Alumnus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meaning ; then by another Alumnus , professing to agree with both , and to set forth the ideas of " Young Yale " still more explicitly . If Mr. Phelps was misrepresented by " The First Alumnus , " or if they both were misrepresented by " Cotherest governor , " Mr. Pikering is not responsible for the misrepresentation . He is not aware that he made any confusion in his quotations , or in any instance imputed to any one of the three what had teen said by any other . He was dealing with " Young Yale , " as represented by all the three , among whom the chief difference was that the second was on one point a little more explicit than the first , and the third a great deal inure explicit than both . Mr. Pickering is sorry to find his use of the word " fool " entirely ( if he should say innocently , he might give additional offence ) misunderstood by " The First Alumnus . " If , in alluding to the Bible proverb , " Answer a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own conceit , " he called those two writers in the Nation " fools , " he had already called himself a fool in quoting from the Apostle Paul , " Am I become a fool in glorying ? " - Having , been betrayed into the folly of glorying in the pre-eminence of his own profession , lie excuses himself by adverting to the equal folly of the assailants of his profession . If " The First Alumnus " had not ( as lie now says he had not ) assailed the clerical profession as inferior in talent and culture to other professions , he knows who had done so in the name of " - Young Yale ; " and lie knows also that the word " fool " was not used by Mr. Pickering as characterizing anything else than the assault on the intellectual character and standing of Christian ministers and the defence of the clerical profession against that assault . He says , " President Wool  --  sey proposed a change in the charter , " and thereupon asks , " Is he also a fool ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian minis , ter  --  one of the profession which " Young Yale " despises and defames . He says , " Mr. Pickering tells us we are ' fools ' for not allowing ' the vener  --  able institution to remain where the founders placed it . ' " Mr. Pickering takes the liberty of saying that in this statement " The First Alumnus " " greatly misrepresents " the matter . Either the professor of logic or the professor of ethics ought to be censured for permitting any alumnus to graduate who can make so gross a misrepresentation . Mr. Pickering requests that all persons who find themselves called to discuss his letter will remember what the question is which was raised by Mr. Phelps in the name of " Young Yale , " and agitated by " The First Alumnus " and the second , both professing to represent the same " Young Yale . " The question is not concerning that change of the character of Yale College which was suggested by President Woolsey some years ago , and was equivocally reported on by " the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important change which President W. never suggested . It is not whether the six State senators in the corporation shall be superseded by as many men chosen in some other Way . That question , extremely difficult and delicate in itself , has been made ten times more difficult by the " worldly wisdom " of ' - Young Yale , " so much wiser than the " saint . liness " of Old Yale . Men of only ordinary sagacity would have said to each other , " Let us take care not to alarm the ministers or the churches till we shall have got rid of the Hon. Mr. Domuch. ' and his colleagues . " But the more than ordinary sagacity of " Young Yale , " instead of waiting for the solution of the question raised by President Woolsey and repotted on by the Committee of the Alumni , has raised a very different question , and has thrown the original question into the shade . Mr. Pickering takes no great interest in the former question , and , therefore , declined to consider it . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwninto the arena by the " worldly wisdom " of Mr. Phelps and the two writers in the Nation , namely , the question about a plan " to aboZish , the existing corporation and to place the legislative and appointing power of the . university , and the custody Of its endowments , in the hands of a board or council chosen by the annual mass meeting of the Alumni . " Mr. Pickering can see no good reason why the gentlemen who propose this plan should not frankly discuss the question of its desirableness and its feasibleness . Let them remember that the question which they have raised is not whether clergymen outside of Connecticut  --  in New York , or Cincinnati , or San Francisco  --  shall be eligible as fellows , nor whether laymen shall be eligible , but whether the absolute control of the university shall be given over to mass-meetings of graduates , electing at their unlimited discretion the members of a new corporation . Thus far , the self-constituted representatives of " Young Yale " have not " catered " very adroitly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fel  --  lows , but Mr. Pickering presumes that the " worldly wisdom " of those who contrived the plan has not forgotten the necessity of commending it to the judgment of practical men by showing what will be the consequences of adopting it and of circumventing in some way the old ministers , without whose consent it can not be adopted . OLD YALE TO THE " FIRST ALUMNUS . " Sin : As you have left your readers in ignorance of your name , and I am , therefore , unable to address you privately , it will not , I presume , be deemed improper if I offer , in a more public way , a few suggestions in regard to your article in the .2nTation , of Nov. 24 on the Yale College Corporation . I have no desire or design to take part in the controversy which has been going on of late in that paper . There are enough engaged in it already without any assistance on my part , and , so far as my own opinion is concerned , I do not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , as the place most suitable for such a discussion . I have no quarrel with you , however , if you think otherwise on this last mentioned point , and I have no wish to have any quarrel in regard to the great sub  --  ject itself . ? But I trust you will pardon me if , in all friendliness , I say that it seems to me unfortunate  --  whichever side in this matter may be right  --  that those who favor a change in the corporation should not inform themselves more accurately respecting the facts of the case before they write for the papers . Misstatements of facts are an injury to the cause which a man advocates . Where they are such misstatements as a little investigation would lead one to avoid , they inevitably will appear to interested advo  --  cates on the opposite aide to be intentional perversions of the truth , and to all persons who are cognizant of the facts they will seem unpardonable because they might be so easily avoided . The writers on your side have fallen into such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has even reprinted his newspaper article in a pamphlet , asks why , if the cor  --  poration must consist of clergymen , eminent clergymen are not appointed , and then gives as examples Dr. Bushnell and others , including the name of one gentleman who had been a member of the corporation for several years ! That writer had not even examined the college catalogue enough to know who the members of the corporation were , and , of course , every  --  body laughed , and a considerable portion of his argument vanished in the ridicule . I beg leave to call your attention to some points in your article of yes  --  terday . I. You say in that article ( Nation , Nov. 24 ) , " Can not the present cor  --  poration see why Mr. Sheffield , Mr. Peabody , Mr. Street , and Mr. Phelps placed their donations beyond its control ? " This question might be a somewhat weighty one if it were founded on fact , but , unfortunately for your argument , it is not thus founded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest in amount ever received by the col  --  lege , and the latter ( considering its results ) perhaps the most valuable one ever made  --  were placed by the donors altogether in the hands of " the present corporation . " These gentlemen had been residents of New Haven for many years , and had had every opportunity for knowing the manage  --  ment of the college , and yet they did not hesitate to commit their hun  --  dreds of thousands of dollars to the existing board . The weight of their testimony -- which is , manifestly , even to your own mind , very great  --  is all on the side of the corporation , and not , as you seem to suppose , against it . To cite their cases , therefore , in your favor , must strike your adversa  --  ries as bold beyond measure , and must impress all others who know the facts as indicating on your part an ignorance of those facts which a person engaged in the controversy ought to have removed by informing himself accurately . The case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mr. Peabody had no unwillingness to place his funds in the hands of the cor  --  poration . Ile had never raised the question of their competency ; but , as I have been informed by one who was active in connection with that matter or wholly acquainted with it , he was persuaded to adopt the course he did by other persons , who , for wise and sound reasons , wished to have the direction of the building of his museum . Everything which he did under their influence was done in entire harmony with the feeling of the corporation , so far as I have ever heard , and , except for those influ  --  ences , he would have given to the corporation itself . In regard to the case of Mr. Phelps , I am not fully informed , but , if I mistake not , his will gives the property to the corporation after the death of his son , only allow  --  ing his son the right to designate the particular object in the college to which it shall be devoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the control of his son during his lifetime , I do not ' know what it was . I think there were probably other reasons existing in the case which induced him to take the course he did  --  one or two of which might be suggested were this the suitable place to present them . But even admitting that be distrusted the capacity of the corporation to manage funds , his case is one which will have little weight with your opponents , or with any who are not previously prejudiced in favor of your side , because they will say that he was , undoubtedly and naturally , influ  --  enced by his son , who is a publicly pronounced opposer of the existing corporation . The fact is , my dear sir , that , whatever distrust of the fitness of the corporation for their work may exist in your mind , or in the minds of a few or a great many others , there has been none , thus far , in the minds of the great givers . Men who have given four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have seen the college for years , and known its trustees , have bad no hesitation about the safety of their gifts , or the wisdom with which they would be cared for , in case those gifts were left in the hands of the clerical gentlemen of whom you speak . Since this controversy began , and since these expressions of distrust first found utterance , more has been donated to the corporation for the college than ever before in ten times the number of years . Surely , then , it is unwise for your own side in the argument , and it will be regarded by all unprejudiced persons as unfair to the other side , if you bring forward such statements as those involved in the question to which I have now called your attention . II . You say , again , in your article , " The Committee of 1869 favor the change . " If you will examine their report , you will confess , I think , the incorrectness of this statement . Their language is , " As to the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the committee express no opinion , for the reason that they are not agreed in opinion . They must leave it , therefore , for the graduates to decide whether it is advisable to recommend a change , concerning the advantages of which the committee hold a divided opinion . " They add : " The committee are unanimous in finding no reason to recommend this or any change for any special defect in the government or administration of the college . There is " no reason to believe that the funds of the institution would have been more carefully guarded or faithfully expended , or that the discipline and instruc  --  tion of the college would have been more satisfactorily administered , under any different constitution of its corporation . " In the light of this plain language , and of what is well known as to the opinions of all the mem  --  bers of the committee , your opponents  --  not to say all who are not parti  --  sans with you  --  will say , The man who wrote that article has not even read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views . Such mistakes  --  so easily avoided  --  certainly injure the cause they are in  --  tended to aid . III . You say farther " We have reason to believe that a considerable portion of the faculty , not under the control of the corporation , would welcome the change . " If you mean by this statement to intimate that there is a portion of the faculty who are not appointed by and responsible to the corporation , you labor under a serious mistake . All the faculties of the several departments of the college are alike under the corporation . Every member of them receives his office from the corporation , and is an  --  swerable to that body for the faithful discharge of his duties . If , on the other hand , you mean to intimate that a portion of the faculty is so far under the personal influence of the corporation as to be properly said to be under , its control , while another portion is not , you are equally in error . The corporation have not tried to influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no members of the faculty who , in either sense , are different from the rest . They are all alike dependent on the e ) rporation for their appointment to office , and all alike free to hold what-ever opinions on such a subject they may choose to hold . I can hardly understand , my dear sir , how a graduate of the college can have fallen into such a fundamental error as is evidenced by the language which I have quoted from your article . Your opponents will use these mistakes most assuredly to your disadvantage . IV . You ask , further , whether the corporation can not see " that either there will be no central , ' harmonious power to govern the university if this state of things continues , or that the Scientific School must be made to overshadow the Academic Department ? " By " this state of things " you apparently mean the continued withholding of funds from the corpora  --  tion , or the placing them beyond the control of that body , as Mr. Phelps , Mr. Peabody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done . The two results to which you refer are the want of any harmonious power-to govern the university , by reason , as we suppose , of the existence of so ( many different boards of dust for the different funds given by different benefactors , and the making the Scientific School to overshadow the Academic Department . What effect this latter course which you predict would have on the present corporation , most persons familiar with the college will , I think , be unable to see . So far as I am able to comprehend your meaning , you seem , in this remark as well as in what you have said in regard to the portion of the faculty not under the control of the corpora  --  tion , to have the idea that the Scientific School is an independent body existing outside of the college corporation . But , if this is your idea , it is wholly incorrect . The Scientific School was created by an act of the cor  --  poration , and is dependent on that body as truly as is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadow the latter as much as the latter overshadowed the former when the former had been in existence but a year , the existing corporation would be in no sense interfered with either in their rights or powers . The two departments are united in one larger institution , which is all under the control of the same board of trustees . If either should grow to ten times its present strength , or it either should die away , the board would have the same control over the larger growth or the single surviving branch that it now has over both the branches alike . V. Yourself and your associates seem to hold it as an established and admitted fact ( see your first article in the Nation , for example ) that your sentiments in this matter are held universally by the graduates of the last fifteen years ; and that if the corporation do not , as you express it , " abdi  --  cate , " Yale College will fail to receive to itself either the sons or the funds of the graduates . For one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact to be as you suppose , nor do I believe the result predicted will follow . I do not believe that any considerable majority of the graduates of the last fifteen years care very much about the question , or have any desire corre , spending with yours to change the corporation  --  any such desire , to say the least , as would make them unwilling to give to the college in case no change were made . I know that some of them do not agree with you at all in regard to the matter . You must remember , also , that the graduates of more than fifteen years ' standing are quite as largely  --  not to say far more largely  --  on the other side of the question ; and that they are the portion of the graduates to whom the college must naturally look , for a good many years to come , for the funds which are needed , because they , much more than the younger men , have property already acquired . Men grow conservative , too , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the younger men should change their views before their funds and their sons have progressed sufficiently to be in readiness to be given to the college . Mr. Walter Phelps , in his commencement speech , placed all of the graduates of over fifteen years ' standing among the conserva  --  tives . The time will certainly be very brief before the younger graduates will have passed their fifteenth year of graduated life , and thus may have become conservatives themselves . VI . It seems to me , since , as you intimate , the ministers must " abdicate " ? that is , must be persuaded to give up their places in the board of their own free will , in order to the accomplishment of the change which you and your associates desire  --  it seems to me , I say , that a more persuasive and concilia  --  tory style than the one which the writers of your party adopt would be better adapted to accomplish the end . Connecticut ministers  --  particularly those among them who pass their lives in Squashville  --  have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ordinary Christians when smitten on the onotheek to turn the other also . But I must confess that it does not ap  --  pear probable to me that the bold and public charge of incompetence for their work , or the threat that , if they do not resign their office , dire ven  --  geance in the form of " no funds and no sons " will follow , will be likely to increase their willingness to abdicate . When the most humble and the most saintly men are pushed beyond a certain point , they sometimes be  --  come a good deal like those who are less saintly than themselves , and it is scarcely good policy to call them bad names or to tell them that if they do not mind what we say and give place , as they ought to , to wealthy and honorable gentlemen whom we can easily name , we will never give them any money to the end of time . They may turn upon us and say , Perhaps you would not give us any money , even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under similar circumstances , we are sure , would say , Give or not , as you choose , we are not going to be driven from our position by threatening language . At all events , my own experience has taught me this , and you will pardon me if I say it to you , my dear sir , that human nature in ministers is very similar to what it is in other men , and that the ends of persuasion are not often accomplished except by persuading . My suggestions , as you will notice , have all of them reference to the manner and style of your defence of the side which you have chosen in this controversy . Of the merits of the controversy itself , I have already said that I have no wish to speak . My opinions , which may differ some  --  what from yours , and also from those of the Rev. Mr. Pickering , are not of much consequence to the public ; but I am quite sure that many of the graduates of Yale will sympathize with the suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some among the graduates may be glad that I have offered them . With much respect , yours truly , X. Y. Z. , Of a Class previous to 1855 . Interesting as this discussion is , it is rapidly becoming too volumin  --  ous for our columns , and we can not , in justice to such of our readers as have no special interest in Yale College , let it go any further . We have been compelled to decline several other communications on the same subject , and , with the publication of one more , already in hand , on the " Young Yale " side , the deb.tte , as far as the Nation is concerned , must close for- the present. ? ED . NATION . DOES PROTECTION PROTECT ? To THE EDITOR OF Tun NATION : Stu : " E. A. " in the last Nation expressed surprise " that the impo  --  sition of duties and the consequent increase of the cost of imported articles should cause such persistent controversy . " He unconsciously gives an explanation afterwards in the assertion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of sixty per cent. , " or $9,000 on each $15,000 worth used . I am buying from DO to 120 tons of cast-steel yearly , and ant interested in the article - so far only as to wish to procure it as cheaply as possible , quality considered . I am quite unconscious of con  --  tributing so liberally to the support of the Government . Steel of the same quality costs me less now than in 1857 to 1861 , when my supply came wholly from Sheffield . The tariff of 1861 raised the cost of steel and helped to establish its successful manufacture in this country : the domestic makers , in order to obtain a footing in the market , under  --  sold their foreign rivals from the start , and still do so . I am using Ameri  --  can steel almost entirely , yet I can , and sometimes do , buy Sheffield steel as low ( in gold ) as at any time since 1857 . Plainly , " E. A. " is wrong in his opinion of the effect of the present duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a brief examination will show . On steel , if it can be so called , worth three and three-quarter cents per pound , the duty of two and one-quarter cents is sixty per cent. , but the same rate on steel worth six and seven cents per pound affords a duty of only thirty-seven and one-half and thirty-two per cent . Three cents per pound duty on steel worth over seven and not over eleven cents , and three and one-half cents per pound , with ten per cent . ad valorem , on steel worth over eleven cents , is forty-three per cent. , if the lower limits are taken on which the percentage of duty is greatest : on steel worth ten and twelve cents per pound , the duty is but thirty and thirty-nine per cent. , respectively . M. " M. " has shown us his bills for the last ten years in proof of his assertions , but confesses his inability to say why competition between foreigners themselves should not reduce the prices of steel in this market as well as competition between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR THE PRESIDENT . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIP , : Is not the Nation , and are not certain other newspapers , too severe in condemnation of Gen. Grant 's present course and relation with the party chiefs ? I remember that when the President began his career as such , he undertook to govern in accordance with what seemed his own way of seeing things , and defied the party lealers . In consequence , he was made war rat by the politicians , his friends who were true men , like Hoar , driven away from him , his favorite measures defeated , and his influence materially diminished . And there was no such expression of public opinion in sup  --  port of his independence as there should have been . The whole country looked rather with amusement than sympathy on his dilemma , and the only remark one beard was , that Grant had undertaken too big a job in trying to govern without the advice and aid of the politicians . When be brought things to an issue in the case of Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the country looked on in perfect apathy , and no indig  --  nant expression of public opinion came to encourage the President . He was left to fight oar battles without support . Finding that he could not fight it through on that line without forces , he had no other resource than to fall back on the politicians , as Ile is now doing . Who is to blame ? Readers of the Nation know that I have no reason to speak well of this Administration , and if my whole story were told , they would say that I had great reason to speak ill of it ; but justice demands , it seems to me , that the President should be credited with good intention in many cases where bad results have actually obtained . Nothing can be more explicit than the President 's message on reform of the civil service , yet I have the highest Congressional assurance that no bill is likely to be introduced favoring any other reform than the abolition of a few useless consulates ; and even this is doubtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural ? it is the endorsement of his first , which every public man in his position would desire ; and since public opinion condemned his efforts to govern with  --  out the party leaders , he naturally looks to the leaders for the support which he desires . I have no personal knowledge of Oen . Grant , but when such a man as Judge Hoar holds his faith in him unchanged , as I know he does , I can not believe that I am mistaken in the opinion that , if the public in  --  terested in pure and unpartisan government had in the beginning come out and supported him , we might have had a far better Administration than we can now hope for . I think that justice to a great man , whose reputation is our pride , should make us all admit this. ? Yours truly , W. J. STILLMAN . MONOPOLIES AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : It becomes most of us to criticise with diffidence the opinions of our highest judges . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Bradley 's construction of the Fourteenth Amendment , given in the " Slaughter-house cases . " The provision of that amendment which seems to have governed the decision of those cases is , that no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges of citizens of the United States ; and the court holds that the right to follow a particular calling is one of the privileges of citizens protected by that amendment . Now to me , at least , it appears clear that the purpose of the amendment was to protect the enjoyment of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by citizens of the United States as such  --  the privileges enjoyed by them , and by no one else  --  the privileges conferred by citizenship . To be sure , citizens have the right to slaughter animals . But how can the right be called a privi  --  lege of citizens of the United States , when aliens enjoy it equally with them ? It is , I think , perfectly plain that the right to pursue a lawful employment , instead of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of citizenship , " has no connection with it whatever .
