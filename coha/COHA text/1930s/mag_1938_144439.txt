" Unwritten Alliance " <P> Industriously in London last week solid , bull-necked French Premier Edouard Daladier and lean , hawk-nosed British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did their potent best to spoil the grandiose State visit which pudgy , mystic Adolf Hitler was to make to Italy this week , escorted by a retinue of 170 German officials , plus 70 German editors , plus 84 German photographers . The privileged photographers were fitted out last week for the first time in blue-grey uniforms with a visored cap and flowing cape . The privileged German editors each received two blue-black uniforms and six pairs of gloves , were warned to have one of the uniforms always freshly cleaned and pressed , ready to be donned at a moment 's notice , since every German must be 100% spick &; span to be seen with the Fhrer . <P> Untidy Premier Daladier , who rolls his own cigarets and always has tobacco crumbs in the creases of his suits , last week left Paris with Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet by special plane for Croydon .

" <P> Night at Windsor . While the world 's cables hummed with such news and Berlin dispatches reported the mood of the German Foreign Office to be " consternation , " Statesmen Daladier and Bonnet went out to be overnight guests of King George and Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle where they were lodged in Lancaster Tower , " the most luxurious guest suite .
