Bird No. 2 : serious unemployment in Czecho-Slovakia , caused by German grab of Czech industrial areas and the pre-Munich influx of refugees from Austria and the Sudetenland . Last week Prague and Berlin devised a stone to kill both birds : a plan to send 80,000 to 100,000 unemployed Czech workmen to Germany . Time : this spring .
