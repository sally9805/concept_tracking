Next to Josef Stalin the most hotly publicized hero in all Soviet Russia is stocky , thick-mustached Lazare Moiseyevich Kaganovich , a smart , ruthless Jew who is credited with leading and driving the Russian peasantry to sow and reap their bumper harvest ( TIME . Jan. 8 ) . <P> Soviet celebrations now feature super-life-size poster pictures of Comrade Kaganovich almost as big and almost as numerous as those of Comrade Stalin . On the Politbureau of the Communist Party which rules Russia , Stalin is No. 1 , Kaganovich No. 2 . When the Five-Year Plan was wallowing among blunders Comrade Kaganovich coined an immortal , all-explanatory slogan , " Why wail over broken eggs when we are making an omelet ! " Last week this potent Bolshevik let fly at the regime of a state with which Russia is on diplomatic and officially friendly terms , the Third Reich of Jew-baiting Adolf Hitler . <P> Speaking to the Communist Party Congress in Moscow , Jew Kaganovich said he had received fraternal greetings from the Communists of Berlin . " To them I say fight hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We too struggled underground for a long time . We , too , were arrested . Our people , too , were whipped during the Tsarist regime . We fought and we won ! " <P> Slated for the great honor of election to the Party 's Central Committee by the Congress last week was another Jew , roly-poly Maxim Maximovich Litvinoff . A few years ago Stalin , after he ousted Jew Leon Trotsky , was markedly opposed to admitting Jews into high Soviet office , but with Kaganovich now his right hand man and Litvinoff wearing the laurels of his triumphant Washington visit . Russia 's Dictator rated last week as benignly pro-Semite.
