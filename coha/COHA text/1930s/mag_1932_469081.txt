THE British crisis of August , 1031 , has had many curious ramifications ; none is more dramatic than that which has placed Mr. Ramsay MacDonald at the head of a government wholly dependent for its existence upon the support of the Conservative Party . British politicians have often crossed the floor of the House of Commons : Mr. Gladstone began his parliamentary life as what Macaulay termed " the rising hope of the stern unbending Tories , " and after a pilgrimage of almost twenty years in liberal governments , Mr. Winston Churchill has returned to his original Conservative allegiance . But Mr. MacDonald 's change is unique . Never before in British political life has the Prime Minister of one party ejected his colleagues from office to become the leader of a government made almost wholly of men who , but a day before , were his severely critical opponents . His action has been most variously regarded . To his new friends it was a superb display of patriotism ; Mr. MacDonald severed the political ties of a lifetime with a single-minded effort to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , his decision was a gross betrayal of the essential decencies of public life . Upon few personal themes of public discussion is opinion so bitter or so divergent . I shall not be concerned here with the question of whether Mr. MacDonald was right or wrong in what hedid a few months ago . That is a question the answer to which lies hardly less in the future than in the past . For one 's judgment of his decision will depend almost as much upon its more ultimate consequences as upon the events which immediately followed it ; and these we do not yet know . I am rather concerned to depict the kind of man Mr. MacDonald is , to paint , so far as I can , a portrait of the personality which , Mr. Lloyd George apart , is perhaps as complex and intangible as any in the long procession of British Prime Ministers . Mr. Asquith , Mr. Bonar Law , Mr. Baldwin , these were men whose character was an open book in which the public could , without undue effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have not withheld their secret . Plain , direct , straightforward , they explain themselves . But Mr. MacDonald , like 141r . Lloyd George , is in an altogether different category . The very path by which he rose is out of the normal . He is not known to the multitude in the clear way in which his predecessors have been known . He stands aloof and apart even from those colleagues to whom intimacy might have been ascribed . He arouses affection and loyalty not , like Mr. Lloyd George , essentially with those who have to work closely with him , but rather among the masses to whom be is the orator of an hour . He is different to Americans from what he is to Englishmen ; and to Europeans , the view held of him is different again . To seize the essence of Mr. MacDonald 's personality is to win the secret of the most baffling figure in modern English politics . II The stages of his career are worth recalling . The son of poor parents , almost wholly self-educated , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morrow , the hard and casual life of the lecturerjournalist , he fulfils almost all the conditions of the log-cabin-to-WhiteHouse tradition beloved of American legend . He was one of the builders of the original Labor Party ; and the Liberal avalanche of 1906 swept him into the House of Commons . He became at once an outstanding figure in the Labor group . A striking presence , a voice that , at its best , is pure music , a rich emotionalism of utterance , a subtlety of tactics not easily learned in the wind-swept school of Socialist experience , no one could doubt from the first day that he was a front-bench man . He was not , perhaps , the easiest of colleagues . He did not pool his mind with his fellows . He enjoyed standing in that dark hinterland between parties , where the unspoken understanding , the unwritten agreement , the half-hint count for so much . He had an intellectual approach less direct , and more mystical , than was characteristic of his fellow-Socialists . He had a tendency to act alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations in which his colleagues did not share . His tastes were not theirs ; he had little of the easy and direct comradeship , the absorption of private in public personality , which is of the essence of the Labor movement . He was respected and admired ; he was never looked upon with the affection , or treated with the intimate confidence , extended to Keir Hardie or Arthur Henderson . On one subject his reputation was outstanding . He was a real specialist in foreign affairs . Widely read and widely traveled , he knew all that a man can know who is not in the inner secrets of foreign offices . From the beginning of his parliamentary career he spoke as one who saw the drift to war inherent in the policy of alliances . He was a pacifist ; and he was never subjugated by the narrow nationalist temper which swayed the larger part of the Socialist movement in August , 1914 . From its inception , he denounced it with a courage and a consistency it is impossible not to admire . He resigned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments . His speeches in the years of war read like a deliberate sacrifice of self upon the altar of conviction . Ostracized by public opinion , hardly heard even by his party , when he was defeated in the Khaki election of 1918 , it almost seemed as though his war record would be fatal to his re-emergence . He was out of the House of Commons for four years ; and that period is seminal to the understanding of his present position . Colleagues seemed to have taken his place ; his war record seemed a pledge of future unpopularity . When he tried , in 1921 , to return to Parliament for what was regarded as one of the safest Labor seats in England , he suffered ignominious defeat . His friends were few ; his reputation seemed tarnished . A new generation was arising in which his place seemed by no means certain . In those years of isolation he must often have reflected upon the price a man pays for steeling himself to resist the easy clamor of the crowd . He was re-elected to Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly different scene . The LloydGeorge coalition had broken up amid the contempt of the public ; the glamour of war had wholly gone ; the forces of liberalism were hopelessly divided . To the new Labor Party , reinforced by recruits to whom the war was proof of capitalist iniquity , Mr. MacDonald seemed the prophet of a new day . By a majority of two votes , he was elected leader of the party ; and that signal triumph was intended by his followers to mark their faith in the full vigor of the socialism he embodied . Within a year Mr. Baldwin precipitately dissolved the House of Commons in the unjustified belief that the country was yearning for protection . The verdict went against him ; and , as the leader of the larger party of the Opposition , Mr. MacDonald found himself , though in a large minority , the first Labor Prime Minister in the history of Great Britain . His ministry can not be termed a distinguished one ; though he made a considerable figure in it . As Prime Minister , indeed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of colleagueship . He showed no power of audacity . He had , in the domestic sphere , no instinctive grasp of policy . His measures seemed designed rather to persuade his opponents that Sneialism was not the menace they feared , than to convince his friends that it was a living principle of action . As Foreign Secretary , on the other hand , he was an instant success . It was not so much that he was responsible for any positive achievement as that he supplied an atmosphere of pacific emollience to a turbulent European situation . When his government was defeated , after nine months of office , lie had convinced the country that , in international relations at least , a Labor Ministry could maintain the traditions of British policy and even enhance their creativeness . His defeat in 1924 meant five years of opposition . They did not greatlyadd to Mr. MacDonald 's reputation . His period of office seemed to have changed the temper in which he approached affairs . His aloofness from colleagues increased . His great gifts of rhetoric seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and definite . He was impatient of criticism , even of discussion . He displayed a curious desire to pose as the man of the world ? the patron of art , the amateur of letters ; and he began to cultivate friendships with that British aristocracy which has so often softened the edge of politica ! conviction by its genius for absorption . In the general strike of 1926 , he cut a peculiarly pitiful figure . No one knew fully on which side of the fence he stood . No one was quite certain whether his attitude was a defense or an apology . There grew up in these years an increasing doubt of the tightness of his convictions . The men most alienated from him were the men who had made him leader ; curiously , the man most doubtful of his fitness for his post is one of his present associates in the National Government . If he retained his position , it was less from confidence in his capacity than from a doubt of his successor , on the one hand , and on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to deprive a man of his job . Five years of Tory rule always provoke the British people to indignation ; and Mr. MacDonald became Prime Minister a second time in 1929 , on this occasion , though with grave doubts on his part , with Mr. Henderson as Foreign Secretary . It should be said that no great administration was possible in the economic conditions he confronted ; but , foreign affairs apart , his record was a pitiful one . Some improvement in the Indian atmosphere must be partly laid to his credit ; but , with this exception , his one desire seemed to be the avoidance of experiment . His aloofness , his autocracy , his timidity antagonized colleagues and followers alike . Socially , he lived almost wholly apart from them . Politically , the principles of his party seemed without relation to the measures he was prepared to endorse . His barren inactivity in the face of grave crisis made critics like Mr. Lloyd George seem well to the left of his outlook . No doubt his spectacular tour in America was a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it came , was singularly barren of important results . In July , 1931 Mr. MacDonald had decisively quarreled with the Left Wing of his party ; the Trade Unions were angry critics of his inertia ; and , if the general run of his followers said little in public of their discontent , their private attitude was one of bitter disillusion . In the Cabinet itself , indeed , it may be doubted whether anyone save Mr. J. II . Thomas whohad never been a Socialist ? was a wholehearted supporter of the Prime Minister , And the latter showed a curious inability to accept with grace or pleasure the revelation that , so far from justifying his fears , Mr. Henderson had proved himself the most distinguished Foreign Secretary of modern British history . When the actual crisis came in August , 1931 , there was no colleague of Mr. MacDonald 's who fully shared his confidence or had real access to his mind . His main social relationships were outside his party . The main influences by which he was impressed were among the Court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet felt that he was separated from them both by policy and conviction ; others had some faint reason for believing that , while he thoroughly enjoyed the eminence of his great office , and not least its socialprestige , he was very weary of his administration . But none of them was prepared for the amazing maneuver by which he rid himself of them , and emerged as the leader of their opponents . None , either , could have foreseen the bitter contempt with which he assailed them in the subsequent election . Extraordinary events beget extraordinary actions ; but , in the whole spectacle of British history , it would be difficult save , perhaps , in the case of Strafford , to find a change of front so decisive or so complete as that which Mr. MacDonald executed . Nor was it made the less extraordinary by the fact that Mr. MacDonald insisted that he had not abated one jot or tittle of his convictions and that he looked forward to the hour when he could rebuild his relationships with the Labor Party , Nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great platform orator of the rhetorical school . In power of rich and emotional utterance , only Mr. Lloyd George can rival him at the present time . His speeches are rarely distinguished for coherent and systematic argument . They are eloquent perorations which state great platitudes with an almost theological enthusiasm . Indeed , it might well be argued that Mr. MacDonald 's hold over the populace is essentially that of a lay-preacher with an immense power of moral fervor . That is shown by his comparative failure , since the War , in the atmosphere of the House of Commons . Platform oratory is at a discount there . What moves men is rather the businesslike handling of facts , the art and thrust of debating argument , or , at its highest , that passionate statement of intimately felt conviction which is the key to great character . The House will listen to Mr. Churchill , Mr. Lloyd George , Mr. Maxton , Lord Hugh Cecil with an interest and an appreciation different in quality from that which it gives to Mr. MacDonald . As a force there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In large part , the reasons for this are to be found in Mr. MacDonald himself . He has no incisiveness of mind . He sees no question in sharp outline . It is never easy , from what he says , to be sure what he proposes to do . He will be vehement , angry , insistent ; he will bang the despatch-box with the air of one uttering immense truths . But when what he has said is analyzed it is never clear or direct or explicit . And this is an essential part of his temperament . It is part of his inability to admit men to his confidence . After a quarter of a century at the center of affairs , Mr. MacDonald remains a man with curiously few friends . He does not give himself to others . He remains always apart from them . He seems shrouded in reserves . He is not the kind of man with whom one gets at once upon terms of affection or confidence . That does not mean that he is not an attractive figure . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a cultivated person , whose ordinary conversation shows at once that he knows his way about the world . He is widely read , and his liking for letters is both wide and deep . He cares for art , and though he likes , a little amusingly , to pose as an expert connoisseur , he has undoubtedly a real love of beauty for its own sake . You can get him to talk eagerly about books or pictures or some cherished piece of old furniture , when a question about politics produces from him either an angry evasion or a passionate gesture of weariness which seems to suggest how anxious he is to be done with it all . He is , too , agreat lover of the country and of traveling . You see him at his best on an early walk on Hampstead Heath , when his mind is fresh , and he can talk about simple , ordinary things . He seems then a frank and direct human being in whose ideas and emotions it is easy to take an intimate share . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all or nothing . He can not bear his rivals about the throne . His jealousy is easily aroused ; and he can become almost feminine in his sensitiveness . He feels criticism acutely , and he has a curious power of retaining the memory of attack long after its consequences have completely disappeared . It is not easy to treat him as an equal . In the first place , he has a full sense of his position ; and , in the second , he tends to treat the man who argues for the sake of the case he has to make as lacking in reverence for his leadership . There is little , either , that is spontaneous in his relations . There is none of the give-and-take which makes political opponents in the House the best of personal friends . He is always on the lookout for inner meanings , secret enemies , dubious cabals . He can find intrigue in the most innocent malice . The result is that not even a quarter of a century 's membership of the House of Commons has made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His progress through the lobbies is never marked by the innumerable signs of real affection which George Lansbury , for instance , will receive on every hand . He is , moreover , a very difficult colleague . He is accessible only when he so desires . He keeps other ministers at a distance . He never seeks fully to reveal what he is thinking to them . They never have the sense that he wants to share in their difficulties or have that kind of general conversation after dinner , that dia. cussion over a week-end at Chequers , which makes the difficult business of government so much sweeter a task . Some of his Labor Cabinet never met him at all outside of official relations . Others had the sense that he was completely uninterested in , and superior to , what they were doing . One of the most eminent of his colleagues never dared , to my knowledge , to put to him a point of policy which he regarded as essential to the success of the late administration . In the Cabinet itself he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his prerogative as Prime Minister which could not brook the ardor of equal discussion , let alone challenge . He always irritated by his unwillingness to decide , his anxiety to postpone taking a step which meant definition of an attitude . He always impressed his colleagues as being weary of the interminable process of administration . He never spurred them on by encouragement . He never offered them that ardor which comes when a leader contributes the fighting spirit to his followers . He always seemed to assume that they were multiplying difficulties for him . None of them felt convinced that he knew MacDonald 's inner mind . His life , in a word , seemed remote from their lives . And this he emphasized by living completely outside the party in social relations . He became effectively a member of London society , and its standard of values seemed increasingly his own . He seemed thoroughly happy in the big social function ? an embassy dinner , a reception at one of the great houses , the private view of the Academy . The atmosphere of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed like meat and drink to him . It was in those circles only that he seemed at ease , and ready to unbend . One never heard from him the kind of talk which indicated that he remained a living part of the Socialist movement . One colleague of his of great distinction , one , moreover , who was not a workingclass member of the party , told me that in the two years of the Labor Cabinet he had no relations with his leader except for official purposes . Just as on his American visit he saw nothing of the Socialists of New York , so in London his essential contacts were with that aristocracy which has the wealth to make life a thing of grace . He could unbend to the miners in his constituency , to whom , and particularly to their wives , he has remained a legendary figure . But both to the Cabinet and to the Parliamentary Labor Party he ceased to offer proof that he was interested in them as persons . His affections seemed engaged in another world . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually can miss in him the very quintessence of the aristocratic temper . Graciousness in abundance , the habitual courtesy of the aristocrat , the power , where he wishes , to unbend in a kindly way to his inferiors , the power of condescension ? these he has in full measure . But he has the aristocrat 's keen sense , also , of the distance that ultimately separates him from other persons . He has that special vanity which consists in a consciousness of not being as other men are . He is uncomfortable with the uncouth , the ordinary , the things woven , or the people formed , of the stuff of everyday life . He can be enraptured by an aristocratic romantic like Sir Oswald Mosley ; he could never be interested in a proletarian romantic like Mr. James Maxton . He could be profoundly interested in a Tory intellectual ; he would usually dislike , and always mistrust , a Socialist intellectual . He could always find time to talk with foreign statesmen of opposing parties ; he would never be at ease with foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , moreover , a high degree of intellectual arrogance . Partly , I think , that is the outcome of a very real intellectual timidity . Pacifism apart , there are few subjects upon which Mr. MacDonald has really definite views . He is a free trader who has an open mind on tariff reform , a Socialist whose main bent is towards liberalism , who sees the unity of society rather than its differences , a religious man to whom dogmas are of little importance , a practical man with a queer streak of mysticism running through his nature . On most subjects he can tell you what he feels ; upon few can he tell you what he thinks . He likes to consider alternatives ; he hates to choose between them . And all this leads him , perhaps for self-protection , to dislike having about him naturally argumentative men or people with very positive convictions . They either make him unsure of himself or they drive him to commitments he is always anxious to avoid . He likes nothing so much as the reasons for doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds which explain his success in the Foreign Office . And his arrogance , I believe , is really a means of safeguarding himself from the pain which deliberate thought inflicts upon him . Mr. MacDonald and logic have never been on friendly terms ; and by treating it with hauteur he hopes to reduce it to a proper sense of its subordination . It is to that timidity , too , that I ascribe his curious hatred of contradiction and directness . He has never got on with blunt , straightforward men , who speak the truth that is in them . That is why there has never been a warm feeling in him for Mr. Henderson or Mr. Lansbury . That is why , also , he and Mr. Thomas , most labyrinthine of negotiators , have always understood each other in a quitespecial way . No one , I think , of politicians in the front rank has ever taken quite the pains Mr. MacDonald will take to avoid a discussion where compromise is difficult . One of the reasons he has never got on with the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do not hint indirectly what they want . They do not urge their views with a proper feeling of reverence . They do not indicate by word or gesture their sense that they are dealing with the Prime Minister of England . Mr. MacDonald is always clumsy in dealing with them because they are so much more interested in substance than in form . He has the sense , in a discussion with their leaders , that his back is against the wall . He hates the attitude which involves decisive speech of that kind . He is wholly alien in temper from that direct march upon the real which is the natural product of the trade-union atmosphere . One other small trait in Mr. MacDonald is worth noting in this connection . When the Labor government took office in 1924 , most observers , including , it is said , the King himself , expected that they would seek freedom from the heavy ceremonial of the Court . Not only did Mr. MacDonald make no such request ; it was clear that the protocol and the uniforms gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zest that stamped him as more royalist than the King . His feeling for ceremonial was , I think , one of the things which contributed a good deal to his separation from the Labor movement . For the latter is easy in manners , contemptuous of form , has a tendency to suspect those of its members who indulge in the pomp and circumstance of position . In the years from 1924 there grew in Mr. MacDonald an interest in the dignity of his position , a desire that his status as the holder of a great office should be recognized , which the habits of the Labor movement could not satisfy . He found the recognition in Mayfair ; it showed a regrettable tendency to be absent in the ardent discussions of a Parliamentary Labor Party meeting . And since Mr. MacDonald was not always very clever at concealing his disgust at its absence , he did not add to the strength of the bond between him and his followers . One other point in this context is of great importance . Mr. MacDonald is extraordinarily sensitive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Like most politicians , he manages to combine an appearance of indifference to its emotions with a passionate desire for its adulation . In this connection , the impact of the War upon him was , I think , decisive . He knew the horror of being an object of general reprobation . He was cut to the quick by the ostracism and anger he excited . His very reserve only made his wounds more difficult to heal . And the comparison between that experience and the same crowd 's unlimited respect for him as Prime Minister hit deeply into his mind . By August , 1931 , he had known three intoxicating years in which his every word was an event , his every movement a matter for chronicle . He was at the center of most great national ceremonial . Society was at his feet . Honors and decorations were his to bestow ; and the vast horde of those anxious to receive them were his humble suppliants so long as he held high office . The crisis of 1931 offered him the prospect of either continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going once again on his travels . To have resigned would have meant to array against him all the forces of business , the press , society , the power of which to destroy he knew so well . To stay in office meant that they would heraldhim as one who put nation before party , who showed a patriotism unique in British annals . The Palace could whisper that he was indispensable . Mr. Baldwin and Sir Herbert Samuel could place their services at his disposal . The man whom the whole nation seemed to despise in 1914 could , in 1931 , be widely accepted , by the very forces he had earlier scandalized , as the national hero . And it was for the kind of good opinion those forces could offer that he had , since 19e4 , become increasingly concerned . To have flouted them again would have been , for him , a new and unendurable Gethsemane . It is not , I think , an unfair picture of Mr. MacDonald 's perhaps half-conscious motivation last August to suggest that this keen sensitiveness to powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor movement , certainly , had no crown to offer him that would not have proved a crown of thorns . Looking back on his decision , it is difficult now to see how it could well have been otherwise . Granted his temperament , Mr. MacDonald , for the present , at any rate , is at ease in Zion . He has the gentlemen of England at his feet ; and there is no other class for whose opinion he is so concerned . It is known that he is specially regarded at Buckingham Palace ; and that is an influence to which he is peculiarly susceptible . Whatever his future , for the interests of big business he will always remain the hero of the crisis of 1931 , the man who threw the Labor Party out and replaced it in office with " safe " men . Even if he is ultimately displaced the Capitalist Press will always have a kind word for him on that account . Never again will he have to endure the bitter attacks of the War period . He announces himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known with his late colleagues . Mr. MacDonald seems to have found his spiritual home . The problem , indeed , is to explain how he ever came to be associated with the Labor Party at all . His leadership is easy to understand . His personal grace , the beauty of his voice , the thunder of his platform rhetoric , these , united . to a pacifist record which made him seem , to the Left Wing of 19V , the symbol of their own extremism , gave him an easy victory over solid , respectable , devoted , but uninspiring Mr. Clynes . His then supporters forgot certain significant things . His antagonism to the Liberal Party was largely the outcome of its neglect of working-class candidates , of whom he was one , in the ' nineties . He opposed the provision of free meals for necessitous school children , He attacked with fervor the establishment of trade-boards in sweated industries . His socialism , in a word , was never rooted in intellectual conviction . It was a passionate emotional dissatisfaction with a social order which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by his obvious gifts . He , the intellectual aristocrat , was driven by the accident of class and fortune to herd with the common people . No one can read his speeches without seeing that the root of them is a sentimental argument against the pain of inequality . No one , either , can read his books without realizing that their continuous insistence upon the organic character of society , the desire to transcend differences by refusing to recognize their reality , is nothing so much as a protest against an order which excludes him from its foremost ranks . Years ago , M. Vandervelde , the Belgian Socialist , wrote that Mr. MacDonald did not understand Socialism . That is , I think , true in the vital sense that it was never , for him , a philosophy so much as a platform of discontent . And when he mountedfrom that platform to the top of the political pyramid he found that sympathy with Socialism had disappeared in the ascent . IV What is Mr. MacDonald 's future ? He remains insistent that , despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that movement ; and some of the most intimate of his friends are engaged in a vigorous campaign to ensure his return . I do not think they will succeed . Pew people outside the Labor movement realize how profound is the sense of betrayal his action of last August has conveyed to the rank and file . At conference after conference , his former colleagues are bombarded with demands that the breach be regarded as a final one . Nor is that all . I doubt whether any of those colleagues would , after the experience of the last three years , find it easy to sit with Mr. MacDonald in another Cabinet , even if he were not its Prime Minister . For they would not feel that he meant what they meant , or that his words conveyed the implication that their words conveyed . They would mistrust the implications of his social connections . They would remember , not only the character of his election campaign , but the fact that he had been the head of a Cabinet which in the first few months of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellogg Pact , embarked upon widespread repression in India , surrendered to the extreme Tories on fiscal reform , and adopted a harsh and inquisitorial attitude to the unemployed . They would be unable to forget the difference between his profession of faith in the need for disarmament and his acceptance of a policy so conservative that Lord Cecil was unwilling to he associated with the delegation which recommended it to Geneva . It would be impossible for the Labor Party to regard Mr. MacDonald 's socialism as serious in the light of the actions of the Government he led. his return would , inevitably , I think , destroy any prospect of unity in the Labor movement . It is unlikely , either , that he will remain with the Conservative Party . For the latter , he has been merely the means to a victory from which a Protectionist policy could be secured . Once that is safe , they have little farther use for him . His friends and the Liberals take up room in the Cabinet which might otherwise be occupied by tried Conservatives ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform of the House of Lords , for instance ) upon which the Tories are anxious to embark . Sooner or later , perhaps within weeks , vital disagreements within the National Government are certain . The Liberals , in all probability , will resume opposition as the consequences of tariff policy become apparent ; and even if Mr. MacDonald survives their departure , his position will then rapidly become untenable . For he has himself made it practically impossible that he should stay . He has so emphasized the gulf between himself and Conservatism , the limited nature of the experiment to which he is committed , that it is doubtful if his reputation would survive the avowal that his future lay in membership of the Tory Party . Spiritually , he would not find the experience difficult ; tactically , it would destroy his influence among the people . His friends are threatening his creation of a Center Party if he is not allowed to return to Labor . They hint at his power to attract to himself the more liberal Tories , some of the Liberals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him in the crisis of last year . It is a pitiful calculation . Tories do not leave the most solid and substantial party in thestate ? the invariable alternative government ? for an experiment the success of which gives no promise of power , the failure of which would end their prospect of a career . Liberals are not likely to follow him in the making of a Center Party where they would not follow Mr. Lloyd George ; and they are still less likely to follow him as the tariff system goes into operation under his sponsorship . There is not a tittle of evidence to suggest that his formation of anew party would be followed by Labor secessions . If its unity survived the critical shock of the crisis itself unimpaired , it is not likely in the least to be shattered by an experiment dependent for its future on the dubious prospects of a single personality whose tenacity of principle it is entitled to doubt . Circumstances , I believe , are likely to force Mr. MacDonald into a very different direction . He may retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosebery , an elder statesman who makes ex cathedra pronouncements from time to time on large general issues . His interests in travel and the arts would occupy him comfortably ; and he would be sure of an honored place in that aristocratic society he finds so attractive . Or he may fall back upon one of the great positions of dignity ? the ambassadorship to Washington or the viceroyalty of India ? which do not involve the usual political commitments . In either , and preferably the former , he would find four or five years of useful occupation with those opportunities for graceful pronouncement ha so thoroughly enjoys . He may even ? though this is less likely ? remain an independent member of the House of Commons for one of those constituencies ? the Scottish universities , for example ? in which the ties of party allegiance are less tightly drawn than in the normal seat . He would make detached orations upon the great issues which arose less with a view to affecting their outcome than of making his semi-retirement touched with the spaciousness of one removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is difficult for anyone who shared in the high hopes of Mr. MaeDonald 's future when he became Prime Minister in 1924 not to be moved by the tragedy of his present position . He could have used the Labor Party to remake the foundations of England ; he has become the helpless tool of its essential antagonist . Most of the policy he now espouses is a direct contradiction of the essential ends to which he has devoted the major part of his life . The man who explained with passion the right of India to freedom imprisons by thousands those who took him at his word . The man who denounced the war of 1914 stands unprotesting in the face of an imperialism as menacing as any in modern history . The internationalist accepts without difficulty one more and vast economic barrier in the way of world-unity . The appointed leader of the working-class movement leads their hereditary foe to the battle . Not since Strafford has there been a change of front so decisive or so tragic . What is the cause of it all ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no man have his former followers given a loyalty so devoted or so unswerving . There may have been differences in outlook and emphasis ; not since the days of Mr. Gladstone has there been service so ungrudging . To part with such startling rapidity from men and women to whom he was the embodiment of hope and faith must have been , even for Mr. MacDonald , a dark and dubious adventure . It is not explained by simple patriotism , unless we assume that he thought himself indispensable to the government of Great Britain ; and that implies an egoism so unique as to unfit him for the post he occupies . It is not due to a sudden change of conviction ; for men 's convictions do not change overnight , and Mr. MacDonald himself has refused to admit conversion . I believe the essential cause of the position is the relation of Mr. Mac- . Donald 's peculiar temperament to the special environment of British politics . Timid , indecisive , vain of applause , he shrank from the price of unpopularity among a society he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lack of it . Its own faith in its standards gave him standards he could not otherwise attain . Its habit of accepting the facts of life without seeking to alter them saved him from the need to reflect upon principles which sought to change those facts in terms of a different social ideal . He had grown away from the people who made him eminent . He had lost the willingness to make their dreams the measure of his own .
