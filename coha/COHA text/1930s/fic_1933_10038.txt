" I 'll tell you what would be the good , " Doc said . " Those that know about herbs say there ai n't any herb much more important than MelancholyThistles . I ai n't tried ' em , but it appears to me this would be a good time to experiment with ' em . They say there ai n't anything in the world so good for curing melancholy . That 's why they 're called MelancholyThistles . " " Are they in the book ? " Cap asked . " Certainly they 're in the book ! " Doc fumbled in his canvas smock , brought out his Culpeper 's Herbal and removed it from its protecting stocking leg . " Here ! " he said . " Here it is ! " He read in a quavering voice : " ' Melancholy Thistle .. . grows in moist meadows . . . flowers in July .. . under Capricorn , and therefore under both Saturn and Mars . Saturn rids Melancholy by sympathy , Mars by antipathy ! ' " " Wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's all that about Slatterns ? " " Saturn ! " Doc said sternly . " Saturn ! " " Oh , " Cap said , disappointed . " I thought it was going to be some- I thing interesting right there . Go on . " Doc resumed his reading . " ' The decoction of the thistle being drank in wine , expels superfluous melancholy out of the body , and makes a man as merry as a cricket . Superfluous melancholy causeth care , fear , sadness , despair , envy and many evils more besides ; and seven years ' care and fear makes a man never the wiser nor a farthing richer . " ' " I ai n't got any Saturns or Mars 's or superfulous melancholic or none of those articles you was reading about , " Cap protested . Doc seemed surprised . " You ai n't ? How do you know you ai n't ? Maybe you just ai n't had enough trials to bring out your melancholy . " Cap 's reply was thoughtful . " No , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real hard luck , I might catch superfulous melancholic . " He seemed to toy with the thought . " I du n no : maybe I got just a touch of melan- ! cholic right now , seeing as how you insist on it so hard . Do you suppose if I put a piece of this thistle in the keg , it would work right on a man , no matter whether he had superfulous melancholic under Mars or not ? Do you suppose ' t would make him merry as a cricket if he had just light case of melancholic ? " " It stands to reason it would ! " Doc said . " If the book 's right , the less melancholy a man had in him , the merrier he 'd get . " Cap gave the keg a resounding slap . " Get a mess of thistles and ' pu ' em on to boil ! We 'll soon find out whether the book 's right or not !

Thus the pines had the look of enormous combs . We lashed these together in pairs , the butts of the branches mingled , so that we had two long ladders with irregular-spaced rungs . These we took to the pigeon-filled elms and stood against the trunks . By now it was almost dark , and the trees were impenetrable silhou- ettes overhead ; but when we loaded two muskets with small shot and II fired into those black shadows , they seemed to explode above us . A million pigeons , disturbed by the noise and the shot , flapped blunderinglyabout , struggling for new resting places . Out of each tree turnhiedtwenty or thirty birds , dead or wounded  --  not nearly enough , considering that those who needed them were numbered in thousands . But when the birds went back into the trees , they lit on the ladder rungs in such quantities that the timbers sagged . Reloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then when we fired , a torrent of pigeons cascaded down to thump and flop beneath the trees . By the time the cripples had been knocked on the head and thrown in a heap , the ladders were again covered with those stupid , fat , longtailedbirds , all of them near bursting from the berries they had eaten . To slaughter them in such numbers seemed sinful at first ; then it got to be like knocking apples from a tree . There was no way of telling , when we stopped for lack of small shot , how many birds there were in the four piles at the foot of the elms ; but they were mounded shoulder I1 high , and any one of the piles would have filled a good-sized farm cart . H A steadily increasing crowd of officers and men had come over from the camp , to see what we were up to . They stood around us in a half circle , their eyes glittering in the light of the fire we had kindled to make sure of finding all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eaten a square meal in months . One of the officers , a tall , thin , simple-looking lieutenant , came to Nason . " Name of Whitcomb , " he said , " attached to Burrell 's Connecticutregiment . Was you planning to eat all those yourself ? If not , I got a few men could use some . " He coughed and added , " I guess we all could . " " I guess so , " Nason said . " That 's what we 've been shooting ' em for . " Ile stared calculatingly at Whitcomb  --  at his broad shoulders , his light brown hair , his leather breeches , his long blue vest with capacious flask pockets . It was as if , almost , he had asked a silent question of Whitcomband received an equally silent answer that more than satisfied him , for he added , " Tell somebody to build twenty of these ladders tomorrow . Then everybody can live on pigeon stew . In case you do n't know it , the best way to eat ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beans ? " Whitcomb asked . He was as harmless and benevolentlookingas could be , and as innocent-appearing as though he scarcely knew what was being said to him ; but if ever there was a dare-devil , it was Whitcomb . We did n't know it at the time , however ; and from the way he said " Beans ? " we thought he must have come from a family that had religious scruples about eating them . " Plain white beans , " Nason told him . " You put a quart of beans in a kettle with some water and the breasts of a dozen pigeons and a little salt pork and an onion , and put another kettle over it , and bury the whole business under a fire all night . Then you got something . " Lieutenant Whitcomb swallowed . " So I 've heard tell . It must be nice if you got the beans . " " Well , " Nason said , " maybe we could find you some beans , even . What you better do now is have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can drag these pigeons to camp in three or four trips . " The lieutenant stared . " All of ' em ? We can have all of ' em ? " The half circle of human scarecrows scattered into the darkness , running . " Yes , " Nason said , " you can have all of ' em if you 'll do a little something for us in return  --  if you 'll find us some barges , so we can load i those timbers and get ' em to Skenesboro tomorrow for General Arnold . " When Whitcomb was silent , Nason added , " All these men here , they 're scouts for Arnold . It 's all regular and above board , only if we wait to get boats through ordinary channels , we may lose a week . " Whitcomb turned to look at the piles of lumber , which showed clearly in the light of the fire beside which sat Cap Huff and Doc Means , taking alternate sips from a tin dipper . " Barges ? " Whitcomb asked . " You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reminded Nason , would do as well . Whitcomb nodded . " I 'll get ' em for you . When things get a little quieter , I know where I can pick up all the boats you need . " Hopefully he added , " I aim to be a scout myself . I aim to scout around and get me one of those German soldiers  --  the kind that 's all weighted down with cutlery so 's he can only march two miles an hour . " He looked so helpless that we felt sorry for him . We took him to our fire , where Cap Huff and Doc Means , in a singular silence , removed the ramrods from over the coals and set our supper before us . The eels were juicy , having been cooked slowly , as should always be the case . Nason picked up Cap 's tin cup , filled it from the mixture in the kettle and gave it to Whitcomb . Then he filled his own cup , and so did the rest of us.  |p203Ca|p  watched us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ? " he demanded . " ' Tis n't bad , " Nason said . " What 's in it ? " " Thittles , " Cap told him . He hiccupped and tried again . " Thithlsh . " I le dismissed the matter with an airy wave of his huge hand . " Now look here , Stevie , wha 's use going to Skenesboro ? Doc'n I been talking , ' n ' here 's what we think . Le 's g'w'up to Eel Ox Nox tonight , juss us , ' n ' have a meeting of the Eel Ox Nox Club . Doc , he 's been elected , and everybody here can be members .

" Make him a non-resident member . " " Tha 's juss what we 'll do ! " Cap cried . " Make him a non-resonant member ! " To Nason he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevie , we would n't need to build a lot of row-galleys or nothin ' . Save lot of work , Stevie , and be great help to Arnold . " He leaned back proudly and surveyed us with a triumphant leer . " I do n't follow you , " Nason said . " Arnold 's orders were --  " " Listen , Stevie ! " Cap leaned forward to drop a confidential hand on ! Mason 's shoulder . " I 'll ' splain everything to Arnold . Arnold do n't listen to many men , but one of the things people look up to me for is how I talk to him . Listen , Arnold , ' I say , because I 'm an outspoken man ; and he always says , What you want ? ' he says . I never see him yet , I could n't go right up to him and have him ask me what I wanted . He ast me t hat once on the trip to Albany , juss on account of the way I was looking at him ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit looking at him that way . Thass how I stand with Arnold  --  juss like that ! " He interlaced the fingers of his two hands : then looked at them interestedlyand inquired , " How you unfasten your hands after you get ' em fixed that way ? Anyhow , it shows you the friendship between I an ' A mold . " Upon that his hands seemed to separate of themselves ; for he looked surprised . " There ! " he said . " They 've quit ! If it 's a sign me ' n ' Arnold ca n't agree about this matter , do n't worry ! Juss disregard his orders , an ' le 's get back to Eel Ox Nox , where it 's all nice , and close enough to the Bri'sh to borrow from ' em . I would n't ask for more obliging neighborsthan them Bri'sh when you want something . " A fresh thought seemed to strike him . " Stevie , " he said thickly , " all we 'll do is g'w'up to Eel Ox Nox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bri'sh and steal us some of their gerranals --  " " How 's that ? " Nason asked . " Steal their what ? "  | " Some of their gerranals , " Cap said , frowning . " We could tell the Bri'sh we juss wanted to borrow ' em . We could steal Gerranal Burgloyd and dress nice afterward , because he 's got fourteen suits of clot lift they 're carrying through the woods for him , along with what goes with ' em . Some of their other gerranals only got six or seven suits of clothesand only use two or three soldiers apiece to carry ' em . But le 's do n't hurt feelings by juss borrerin ' Gerranal Burgloyd  --  Burgoyle  --  alone . Le 's borrer all their gerranals . " Doc Means looked troubled and cupped a hand about an ear . never heard the term . What are these articles you 're talking about , Did you say journals ? " " Why n't you listen to what I say ? " Cap shouted angrily . " I said ' get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bri'sh with fourteen carts full of suits of clothes and hats , and four wagonloads of champagne and nap . kins , and two bottles of ink to write home to King George about what disgusts him . If we steal enough gerranals , Arnold would n't worry about boats , would he ? Because the Bri'sh would n't have nobody left to early nothing for , and they 'd go home . " He turned politely to Whitcomb . " You ' quainted with Gerranal A nold ? Greatest man ever was ! " Whitcomb stared gloomily into his empty cup . " Not personally . W all heard how he stole the communion cups out of the church up in Montreal . " Cap shook his head as if an insect buzzed about his ear : then , focussinga hard eye on Whitcomb , made as if to struggle to his feet . Nason pushed him back again and looked carefully at Whitcomb . " Lemme up ! " Cap said thickly . " I 'll show him who stole any cornmulioncups ! I 'll commulion cup him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll fight the British and no one else : no one else ! Understand ? " He turned to Doc Meant , " What was put in that rum ?

Lotta splerfrus liars , ' s what doctors are ! " Nason reached for the kettle and spilled its contents on the groun " That 's the place for it , whatever it is ! " To Whitcomb he said quietly : " Now here ! That 's not the first time we 've heard the story about Arnold stealing things from Montrea Where 's it come from : that 's what we want to know ! " " You think it is n't true ? " " We know it is n't ! What we do n't know is how any such stories camel to sift all through the army ! Who started them , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in Montreal ! They knew better , every damned one of ' em ! " " I guess there 's no call for profanity , " Whitcomb said coldly . " I 'm only telling you what I heard . " " Listen ! " Nason said . " If we ever lose Arnold out of this army , you 'll find plenty of cause for profanity ! You say you aim to be a scout ; but when I ask you where you got your stories about Arnold , all you can do is tell me there 's no cause for profanity . A hell of a scout , you 'd make . If somebody sent you to scout for Indians , you 'd probably come back with a hoorah 's nest . " Cap Huff hiccupped . " Took the words right out of my mouth , Stevie ! Feller like that , he 'll prob'ly resign from the army if somebody tells him all the Bri'sh are bastards ! " " That 's enough for you , " Nason told Cap . To Whitcomb he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll take it now . " There was a trace of surprise in Whitcomb 's voice . " I guess maybe t there 's something in what you say . Let 's see , now . Most of those stories about Arnold came from folks that got a good deal of sympathy for Colonel Easton and Major Brown . Appears to me I never heard anybodytalk so violent about anyone as the colonel and the major did about Arnold when they went through here . " " Where were they going ? " Nason asked . " Near as I could make out , " Whitcomb said , " they were going to Congress to complain about Arnold and try to get higher rank . " " Higher rank for Easton ! " Cap Huff cried . " What rank 's he entitled to ? Regimental wet-nurse ? " 4 Whitcomb shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't know anything about that . There 's a lot of New Hampshire officers been listening to Easton and Brown , on account of the things Arnold 's been saying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Hampshire officers do . There 's a good many of ' em think we 'd get along better if the war could he put in the hands of New Hampshire men , without too much interference from strangers . They 're the ones that tell you how Arnold did n't do anything in Montreal except steal . If Arnold ever gets into $ court-martial , he 'd better make sure there ai n't any New Hampshire men on the court . " Nason stared at Whitcomb and Whitcomb contemplated the fire , in which eel bones still burned blue . I pretended to be half asleep ; but I was a turmoil inside , wondering and wondering about the letters Ellenhad carried from St. John 's for Easton and Brown . I dared not speak , for fear I might somehow set Nason on Nathaniel 's trail  --  somehow involveNathaniel , and Ellen with him , in disaster. 2o6 RABBLE IN ARMS " I do n't like it , " Nason said . " I do n't like any of it ! There 's something queer in all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that make you say , This happened before . ' Ever since Arnold made his first attack on Canada , nearly a year ago , lies about him have poured out of Canada . They poured out of Quebec ; and now here they are , pouring out of Mont-real ! " " They 're scared of him , " Cap Huff said . Apparently the effect of the thistled rum was wearing off . " It ai n't worth lying about anyone unless you 're scared of him . " Whitcomb was thoughtful when he rose , and in his voice was a trace of discomfort . " I better go along with these boys and pick up the boats you need . " He slapped the remaining timbers calculatingly . " That 's good , " Nason said . " We 'll be obliged to you . " Then , as if to ease Whitcomb 's embarrassment , he added : " If you still want to be a scout , you 'd better get leave and come to Skenesboro , where we can say a good word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looked to be afflicted with something halfway between the yellow-jaundice and rigor mortis ; and the place caused so much anguish before we were finished with it that Doc 's description came to seem high praise . The southern end of Lake Champlain is a narrow appendix , more like a river than a lake . For twenty miles it holds the center of a pleasant valley ; but at Skenesboro a ragged limestone mountain rises abruptly in its path , and the lake , as if overawed , crawls into a rocky ravine and ceases to exist . The Philip Skene for whom Skenesboro was named was an English army officer who had married a rich wife and been granted thirty thousand acres of land at the tip of the lake , by the King ; but because of his loyalty to the English , he and his family had been arrested early in the war and imprisoned in Hartford . On the lower slope of the mountain , sheltered from north winds , stood Skene 's house and barn , built out of yellowish stone that did indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow lake-end and on a cove into which the waters of Wood Creek tumbled In a cascade of yellow foam . Wood Creek was more important than its name implied , for there was a sawmill , an iron-foundry and a gristmill at the falls , and the creek itself was the one natural roadway between Skenesboro and the south . Once past its cascade , travelers could row from Skenesboro to Fort Ann ; and Fort Ann was halfway to the Hudson . If we received supplies for building ships , they could only reach us by way of Wood Creek . Consequently Wood Creek , to our minds , was the very heart and forefront of Skenesboro . When , however , we rowed our timber-laden whaleboats into the rocky ravine beneath the limestone mountain , we were appalled . The gristmill and iron-foundry were empty and haggard-looking . Scattered among the trees were cabins in which lived Negroes imported by Skene from the Sugar Islands . Except for Nathaniel and Zelph , who waved us to a landing near the falls , Skenesboro seemed lifeless and hopeless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence a fleet208 RABBLE IN ARMSfor the halting of the British . Yet a fleet must be built , for in no other way could the British be stopped . I 'm often asked why the British should have waited for us to build a fleet : why they did n't row after us in small boats , if they were so d. termined to pursue us ; or why they took the trouble to row at all : why , in short , they did n't march immediately along the shore of the lake and scatter our sick and frightened army like a flock of pigeons . Or why , for that matter , they did n't bring down upon us the splendid fleet we had seen through the haze of Lake St. Peter while we lay on the sandbanksof Sorel . It 's no wonder these things are n't clear to all . Even such military experts as Lord Germain and his advisers saw no reason why their regimentscould n't march from Quebec to New York in a week 's time . Consequentlyit is not astonishing that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knowledge of ships and guns anal weight of metal . It 's for the sake of those fortunate souls who know nothing of wt that I tell here the things which seemed to us so clear and simple , bt might never have been seen at all if Arnold had not been there to u derstand them . In the first place , most of the British vessels we had seen at Soral drew too much water to enter the Richelieu . Those small enough t  --  sail up the river were obliged to stop when they reached Chambly rapids ; for ships can not climb rocky hills . They could not even be dragged around the rapids on wheels or sledges ; for the British tried it and failed . Therefore if the British wished vessels on Lake Champlain they were obliged to build them , or to carry them over the road in sections , as we had carried the ship timbers from St. John 's  --  a task as arduous , almost , as building them . But the Americans already had three vessels on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's men in May a year ago : the sloo Enterprise , captured by Arnold in his dash to St. John 's the same mont and the stout schooner Royal Savage with her twelve brass cannon , ca tured by Montgomery at St. John 's when he took it from the British i the preceding November , on his way to join Arnold at Quebec . The were in bad condition ; but they were vessels , and could quickly b made seaworthy by capable ship carpenters . Their guns , moreove were in place ; so if handled by seamen , and the guns manned by prope marksmen , nothing could compete with them except vessels equall well armed . If the British had tried to send an unprotected army dow the lake in canoes and bateaux , we could have sailed alongside them itp209these three vessels of ours and blown them to pieces at our ease and pleasure . And use the lake the British army must  --  not only use it , but gain complete control of it before they could send their army south to join I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no roads along the lake ; and even if there had been roads , the British would never have dared to march men and supplies along them  --  for one reason because they would have had to protect t heir line of march from attack , or had the line cut and be left to starve in the wilderness . Such protection would have required the use of all their troops for guard duty , and left none for fighting . For another reason , they would have been obliged to build a hundred and fifty miles of road , from St. John 's to Ticonderoga , across swamps and rivers , and through trackless forests . The roads would have had to be stout enough to provide passage for artillery , for the carts carrying wines , uniforms and household equipment for their officers , as well as ruin , potatoes and mutton for their soldiers , and to stand up under the burdenof their Hessians , each of whom weighed , Cap Huff swore , close to half a ton on the hoof . If , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been three years at it , and been eaten by mosquitoes a dozen times . Consequently there was no way out of it : the British had to use the lake for the transportation of their men and supplies , but they could n't use se it until they controlled it . The only way they could do this was by setting to work at St. John 's , building more ships than we could build , and doing it in a hurry , making it possible for their regiments to strike at us late in the summer , hack us to pieces and march down the Hudson to join Howe . There was no way of knowing how large a fleet the British would build at St. John 's ; but it would certainly be one that would give us plenty of trouble . They had everything with which to work  --  timber easily transported from the St. Lawrence ; a fleet full of sailors on whom to draw ; as many ship carpenters as they wanted from Quebec and Montreal and Three Rivers , as well as from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's ships that had driven us from Sorel , and as many great guns as they wanted , and above all as many naval officers as they needed to command their vessels when built . . . . We gave no thought to such things when we pulled our whaleboats bit- the cove of Wood Creek on that hot June afternoon , but were only filled with dry-mouthed wonder as to how to commence c , ir work.  | There we were , nine of us , in the whaleboats : Verrieul , Natanis , helpless-lookingDoc Means , Cap Huff , Whitcomb , Nason , Tom Bickford and that oddly garbed white Indian Joseph Phipps . On the shore stood Nathaniel and Zelph ; and so far as we could see , whatever fleet was built would have to be built by the eleven of us . Except for the timbers of the one vessel we had brought with us , we had nothing with which to work : nothing , that is to say , except a sawmill without logs , an iron-foundry without iron or workmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless Nathaniel and Tom Bickford and myself should be counted as carpenters , and perhaps Zelph , who had worked a little around ships . We had no canvas , no nails , no cordage . Barring the hatchets in our belts , we had no tools  --  no felling axes : no grindstones to keep them sharp : no adzes or hammers . We had no oars , no sailors , no money . And in spite of all that , we pointed out to each other likely locations for stocks  --  stocks for the vessels that must somehow be constructed oiitJ of God knew what . When my whaleboat slid into the shallows , Nathaniel and Zelph hauled her bow to land . " Zelph 's got two axes , " Nathaniel said . " He thinks maybe he can find more . A man came over from Albany this morning to say there 'd be thirty carpenters here tomorrow . He 's up at the barn , finding places for ' em to sleep . " Cap Huff waded ashore , his keg of rum cradled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thirty carpenters from where ? " " From Albany , " Nathaniel said . Cap Huff shook his head ominously . " Yorkers ! I better see about gettingus some place to live : some place where those Yorkers ca n't steal everything we got ! " He hurried away with his keg of rum , and with him went Natanis and Joe Phipps to hunt food for our suppers ; while the rest of us went to work . By sunset that evening , the timbers we had brought were stacked on either side of a rough staging hacked from the slopes of Wood Creek with Zelph 's two axes and our tomahawks , and lashed in place with wattape . We had cut blocks and placed them at the proper height and inclination . On these we had set the keel of the St. John 's vessel , erected her stem and sternpost and made six ladders to let us start work on the following morning with no loss of time . Nathaniel told me enough about Ellen to let me know she was comfortable in a three-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . He might have told me more if I 'd pressed him ; but this I would n't do , for I 'd made up my mind that her likes and dislikes were too violentp211and stubborn for me , and that the less I saw of her , the better off I 'd be . Since I did n't press him , he was full of a strange tale about the Negroesleft by Skene on his place : how they seemed to be entirely withoutbrains , knowing nothing and understanding nothing when he had sought their help in finding axes and other tools . Zelph , said Nathaniel , had sat down with a few of them , and played with his dice , and shown them how to play . They had played for hours . Zelph had lost nearly all his money . Then , suddenly and surprisingly , he had won it hack , together with two axes which Skene 's Negroes had unearthed from beneath their cabin floors . " I would n't be surprised , " Nathaniel concluded , " if those black men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wonder but what , if you and Steven Nason went and talked to ' em , we might find they had more than axes hidden away . " It takes a Negro , I knew , to understand a Negro . " Zelph , " I said , " if those black men of Skene 's have tools , we need ' em . You quit work right now and go to see ' em . I 'll give you till tomorrow night to get all their tools . If you do n't get ' em , we 'll tear down their cabins and dig up the floors . " Zelph fished his dice from his pocket , worked them tenderly in one black paw : then dropped them deftly onto a flattened pink palm . " Nick ! " he said . The dice showed a five and two  --  seven . Zelph laughed in a way that presaged ill for the belongings of Skene 's Negroes . Cap Huff , smelling strongly of rum , peered over Zelph 's shoulder . You ca n't do that again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dice . " How much you bet I ca n't ? " " I bet you a million dollars you ca n't . " " How much real money ? " Zelph persisted . " How much ? " Cap asked . " Why , ten dollars Continental . " Zelph shook his head . " Ten dollars Continental ai n't worth throwing for . " He again dropped the dice into his outspread palm . They showed a six and a one  --  another seven . Cap watched Zelph depart , his elbows thrust well out , after the manner of Negroes when they feel important . " By God , " he said , " it ai n't natural , the way those things act ! I 'll bet he does something to ' em , and I got to find out what ! " ... Cap had chosen one of Skene 's horse-sheds for our living quarters . He had brought hay from the barn and spread it on the floor , and in one corner he had buried his keg of rum . The horse-sheds faced the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off with uprights . Thus they were airy and cool212 RABBLE IN ARMSp212on hot nights ; and we could look out at our cook-fire from our bunks , which we built of logs along the sides and back , and filled with balsam tips . Thanks to the multitudinous thoughts that filled my brain that first night I could n't be comfortable in my hunk , but turned and fretted , wondering about tallow , spikes , cordage , files , bitts , adzes , seamen , belayingpins , pulleys and a million other things we needed . To think of any one thing we lacked was to think of a dozen other things , all equally unobtainable , and all vital to the building of a vessel . " What you breathing so hard for ? " Cap Huff asked . " One of the reasonsI was so anxious to come here was because I thought it would he quiet enough to let me catch up on my sleeping . " " If we had axes and could start getting out timbers , " I told him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't need bolts or half spikes for a week or so ; but we 'll have to have tools and stores before we can do anything about row-galleys . Two hundred miles those stores must come , from Boston and Salem , maybe , or even New Haven and Providence , over roads not fit to he called roads . Maybe there is n't any way we can get any of the things we need . " " Listen , " Cap said , " how long you got to be in the army to find out it ai n't no good to worry about getting something ? Either you get what you need , or you do n't get it . Most generally you do n't ! " Nason was more encouraging . " We do n't have to do everything ourselves , " he said . " Arnold must have written a million letters by now , asking for what we need . He never overlooks anything . He thought of Phoebe , even , and she wo n't disappoint him . She 'll find some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't he long before she 's here . There 's shipyards at Newburgh and Albany ; and Schuyler 'll make ' em let us have supplies . He 's as smart as Arnold , almost . There 'll be officers here , just as Cap Huff says , and they 'll have to do the worrying . All we 'll have to do is work on a vessel . " Somewhat easier in my mind , I stared up into the blackness above me , wondering and wondering how the miracle of a fleet could ever be accomplishedhere in the heart of a forest , where the scent of tar and seaweed had never penetrated . .. . A mist still hung over the lake when we went to work the next morning , long before sun-up . Before it had burned off , we had staked out the ways for six gundelos , each to be sixty feet long on a fifty-fivefootkeel . While we staked out the last of them , we heard the shouting of a noisy company on the Wood Creek road . They straggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , all in dusty brown , with wrinkledgray stockings and hickory shirts black beneath the arms and on the back with sweat . Felling axes were made fast to their waists . They carried bundles of tools wrapped in blankets . There were thirty of them ; .11 id their leader , a genial , stooped man with no teeth to be seen in his upper jaw save one yellow one , asked who was giving orders . I said quickly that I was . He took my word for it , which he would never have done if he had been a soldier . A soldier would have wanted to know all about it , and by what right I gave orders , and when and where I received my commission ; and until satisfied , he would have done nothingwhatever , not even though the British had been on the verge of overwhelming us. 13y midday we could hear the distant whanking of axes , and by midafternoonlogs were coming into the sawmill , thanks to the help of four horses Cap Huff had somehow persuaded near-by settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running , and those of us at the water 's edge worked to the rumbling clank of the treadway and the whining rasp of the saw biting into oak . In a week the quiet serenity that had once brooded over this small backwater had wholly vanished . Bateaux crawled in , both by lake and by creek , bringing a little of this and a little of that . Messengers , gray with fatigue and caked with mud , rode in from the Atlantic coast on lathered horses . To whom they reported , we had no idea . The place seemed to have no head ; nor did there seem to be need of giving orders . Every man , in those first days , did one of the thousand things there were to do , and the row of keels on the stocks somehow sprouted ribs and grew a skin of planking . Seeing that the gundelos were progressing , I took Nathaniel and Tom Bickford from their work and we set up stocks for two row-galleys ; for I hoped we soon might have both timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from Ticonderoga , and suddenly there was food to be had from them  --  real food , such as none of us had seen since we left home  --  beef , mutton , butter , cheese , greens by the boatload , aid best of all , punch and porter to slake the fires that burned within its after our hours of lumber handling , hammering , chopping and pounding in the sultry July heat . Ship carpenters appeared as though hatched out by birds . While we worked on our gundelo , short-handed , a new worker would appear besideus , sweating and cursing as if he had been there always ; and before we could ask him who he was , he would be gone and two others would have come to take his place.  |p214There  were fifty carpenters from Connecticut and another fifty fron Rhode Island . They had worked on privateers , and were contempt ' : ous of these little vessels on which we toiled : contemptuous of us , too because we worked for nothing , whereas they had been given fabulous , wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , hart i money , for each day 's work , some of them bragged , with a cow apiec to boot , and free food . It made no difference to me how much the carpenters received , so long as we got carpenters ; but Cap Huff felt differently about it . At night lying in his bunk , he complained bitterly . " Damn it , it ai n't reasonable for those people to get five dollars a day , hard money , and us not ge nothing but a chance to stop a cannon ball . We ought to take and d something , such-like as raising hell about it . " Nason rebuked him . " Be grateful , " he told Cap , " for the blessingyou'vegot . You ca n't do anything about the wages these carpenters get , so it 's no use fretting about it . " Cap kept on grumbling , however ; and he spent all his nights with Zelph , playing with Zelph 's dice . In a short time Skene 's barn was filled with workmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better quarters . From morning to night the place was a turmoil of hammering and shouting ; and in the cool of the evening , when the leaves hung dark and motionless , men brawled and howled and went stumbling down to the lake to splash and thrash in the milk-warm water . Into the midst of all this there came , finally , a terrible curse  --  a portly officer with a pot belly , pursed-up lips and a face the color of a crabapple , a sort of velvety reddish-purple . He came in a whaleboat , rowed by four men ; and to see us the better he stood in the bow of the boat , dressed in a blue uniform coat too tight for him , gold swabs on his shoulders like robins ' nests built out of tarnished gold thread . His ap pearance would have been more impressive if he had hidden the pipe that hung from the corner of his mouth  --  a big-bellied affair the shape of a Canadian stove , and even more smoky . I was unhappy to learn , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in ship building but in fighting ; that he was a Dutchman from Albany who signed his letters " Jacobus Wynkoop , Commander of Lake Champlain . " My unhappiness was greater on the following morning , when he came down to see us , his pipe sending up smoke that smelled of burnt feathers . He was accompanied by a young secretary who looked and acted uncomfortable , and clumsily bumped into and stumbled over almosteverything in sight . What Wynkoop saw seemed to cause him neither enthusiasm norp215disturbance until he reached the stocks for our new galleys . When he saw them , he blinked and sniffed , and shot a question at me that might have been in a foreign tongue for all I understood of it . I was saved mm embarrassment by the secretary , who asked the question again in English , saying , " What 's this here now ? " I said it was a row-galley , whereupon Wynkoop shook his head decisivelyand said , " Ve ke n't built ' em : ve ke n't built row-gellies ! Sdob id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " General Arnold specifically asked for row-galleys . He asked me to design row-galleys , so he 'd have vessels fit for maneuver-ing . " Wynkoop snorted . " Vat you going to fessen ' em togedder mit ? Sdring ? Vair 's der nels ? Vair 's der boldts ? Vair 's der sbyges ? Vair 's der sells and ricking ? " " Well , " I said , " we 're bound to get spikes and bolts sooner or later and I figure to get sails on ' em somehow . General Arnold wants rowgalleys . He told me --  " Wynkoop snatched his pipe from his mouth and glared at me . " CheneralArnolt ! I du n't gif a demn for Cheneral Arnolt ! He e n't der feller dot hess to vite dis vleet ! Id 's me ! " He thumped his chest . " Me ! Vite it , chess , and maneuffer it ! Id 's as issy to maneuffer a gundelo ass a row-gelly . Und ve ken built dree gundelos vile you 're drying to built vim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neider ! Zum ten Eel mit ! I vu n't heff it ! Nudding but gundelos I vu n't heff ! " So there was an end of our row-galleys . I wondered where Arnold was , and what he would say when he found I had n't obeyed his orders to build galleys ; but there was nothing to be done about it , for his orders had been superseded by Wynkoop 's . That 's one of the unfortunate but inescapable things about an army . IIa ! f the orders are given by men incompetent to give orders ; but for the sake of maintaining the discipline without which an army is worthless , the orders must be obeyed on pain of public disgrace or even of death . We went back to work on the vessel whose frame we had brought from St. John 's . Here , at least , was something so near finished that not even a Wynkoop would want to stop her . Since she was small , we had given her as much deck space as possible , arranging to rig her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight guns . Between the gun-ports we made oar-ports , five ports to a side . Thus in spite of Wynkoop 's . desire for gundelos , we had one row-galley after all  --  a sloop row-galley ; hilt a row-galley none the less . Her hull was so near finished that if we could have got oakum , we could have plugged up her seams somehowai6 RABBLE IN ARMSp216and tossed her into the lake so to lay down another vessel on her stocks . But having no oakum , we had to leave her as she was and work on her powder-magazine and fo'c'sle , which was like working in a hot corner of hell . Not content with stopping our attempt to lay down row-galleys , Wynkooptook carpenters from shipbuilding and tree-felling in order to build a fort and barracks for additional ship carpenters and the troops who were expected to arrive to man the fleet . The fort was a stockade that rambled over hill and dale  --  a stockade so long that a dozen regiments would have been required to man it properly ; and the barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discomfort to any so unfortunate as to live in them . Thus , although those of us who were left to work on the vessels did more and more each day , our progressbecame slower and slower , and our despair over Wynkoop greater and greater. * .. . It was not the stifling heat in the fo'c'sle of the unfinished rowgalleythat made me eager to escape from it and work on a gundelo , where I could be in the open ; but the fact that I could no longer keep an eye on the activities of Ellen Phipps . Each day , since our arrival in Skenesboro , she had descended the hillslopenear Skene 's big house , gone around behind the shipyards and come down to the lake , sometimes with her brother Joseph and sometimesalone . Each day she carried a small bundle with her , a bundle that held clothes ; and I could see her , at times , kneeling on the shore and scrubbing white garments against a rock , while Joseph sat idly by , fishing . Her every moment held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual ferment as to what she was doing , and why . I was restless if I could n't see her , and equally restless if I could . My curiosity extended even to Joseph Phipps and the peculiar garments he wore when with Ellen . He did her the honor to wear his green coat ; but beneath it he wore no shirt , nor did he so much as own a pair of pants . Thus he had the look of being naked  --  or would have had that look if his skin had not been as brown as a musket-butt from exposure to the sun . I am , I hope , tolerant of the peculiarities of others , but Joseph 's pantslessstate disturbed me . Something , I felt , should be done about getting pants on him . This feeling became stronger than ever after I had worked for two days on the fo'c'sle of the row-galley , and so been withoutsight of Ellen in all that time . I am free to say , now , that I recognizewhat lay behind this sudden dissatisfaction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , of course , the desire to say something , no matter what , to somebody who had recently been with Ellen : the vague longing to hear from her , somehow : to speak her name freely , even , as an easement for the emptiness within me . But like all people in my condition I could not , at that time , admit this , even to myself ; and it is possible that I might have said nothing to Joseph about his pantsless state except for an unguarded speech of Cap Huff . Cap had a habit of returning early from his work in the shipyard in order to dig up his keg of rum to see whether anybody , as he put it , had been at it . On such occasions he took Doc Means with him to do the digging , while he himself kept a look-out to make sure nobody spied on their activities . On returning from the shipyard , I found their labors had been successful ; for the two of them , squatted before the fire , were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasting of a small pig ; and while the pig sizzled above the coals , Cap , in his roaring voice , was singing the praises of Steven Nason 's wife , who was being anxiously awaited  --  not only by Nason , but by all of us , since she was expected to bring more ship carpenters to help us in our labors . " Yes sir , " Cap bawled , " she was smart , and it ai n't no good my telling you about it , because you ca n't get no idea how smart she was from what I say  --  not that I ai n't a powerful speaker ! She was smart , and she had to be smart to beat the hellcat that Nason was preossified in . " Doc Means blinked . " Pre-whatted in ? " " The one that had him engroppsed , " Cap explained . " For years he was engroppsed in this hellcat  --  she come from Arundel , too , though you 'd never a-guessed it when we found her in Quebec , smelling of perfume enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her off like a brick powder-magazine ! " Cap passed the tin cup to Doc and made a series of gestures with his vast palms , as though he caressedthe exterior of a giant hour-glass . He wagged his head , as at a dangerously pleasant recollection . " Yes sir ; she was an Arundel woman , too , same as Phoebe . We got all kinds in Arundel , like everywhere else . Women ai n't no different , wherever you are . They think the same things , and you handle ' em the same way . " " I s'pose so , " Doc Means sighed . " How was it you handled this hell-cat ? " Cap cleared his throat . " By God , she done a good deal of handling  --  herself ! Before we got through with her , she had some of us handled nigh into hell  --  her and that Frenchy she was living with up in Quebec ! It 's God 's wonder she did n't talk Nason into being a British major . You218 RABBLE IN ARMSp218ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! Called him a pheasant and told him to go back to his cesspool and eat fish-bones . " Doc Means passed the tin cup to Cap . " She sounds kind of talkative to me , " he opined . " No , " Cap said , " she did n't say much , but what she did say made you damned uncomfortable . " Cap growled and spat . " Pretty as a picture of Philadelphia as Seen from Cooper 's Ferry , too  --  big blue eyes , and yeller hair , and freckles like inside a lily , sort of , and a smell like deliciousflowers . Made you want to bite her , kind of . " He spoke with gusto , exclaimed " Hoy ! " enigmatically ; then drained the tin cup and licked his lips unctuously . " She thought she could do damned near anything with Nason ; but she could n't ! Phoebe would n't let her ! " He stared hard at Doc Means . " A hellcat : that 's what she was , and an Arundel woman , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all up and stuck a de ' in it : Marie de Something  --  Marie de Summlething  --  Subblething  --  don'tit beat hell how those Frenchies think up names you ca n't even remember , let alone pronounce ? " A picture shot into my brain with knifelike sharpness . I saw Nathaniel , in the box at Ranelagh , holding up a rosy , paper-thin slice of ham and pretending to read my father 's letter through it . I heard his voice , even : " Dated from Arundel in the Province of Maine , " he had said . Those were his first words ; and they had been heard by Marie de Sabrevois , blue-eyed , golden-haired , perfumed , with " freckles like inside a lily , " standing beyond our box in her dress of pink brocade , beside the silent , sleepy-looking Mr. Leonard . Mr. Leonard had volunteered , later , that they had heard what Nathaniel had said , and so had Marie de Sabrevois ; but she had denied any knowledge of such a place as Arundel . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . Cap 's jaw dropped ; he stared at me from round eyes . " That 's just what it was ! Where 'd you ever know that poison ivy ? " I contrived , somehow , to keep my face expressionless . " It 's a corn ; mon name in Canada , " I said . " There 's a place of the same name not far from Isle aux Noix . " Cap nodded . " It 's just as well you do n't know her . There was n't anythingthat hellcat would n't do ! She learnt it from the feller she lived with . He was her brother , she said . Brother hell ! No sir ! You 're well off not to know her ! She do n't like Americans , and she do n't like Arundel people , and she do n't like Arnold . " " Why not ? " Cap scratched his head thoughtfully . " Why not ? Well , she do n't likep219Americans because she used to be one herself and then stopped being ne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we killed the her she lived with . Leastways , it was Steven killed him , kind of by ccident ; but I say we ' because if he had n't , I 'd ' a ' done it on purpose ! " " That does n't account for her not liking Arnold . " " No , " Cap agreed . " Well , she do n't like Arnold because Arnold 's a  --  lend of Stevie 's for one thing , and because Arnold went up to Montn1 , years ago , and dragged her out of a convent to see if she was the tine one that used to live in Arundel , and by God , she was ! " Cap 's voice rumbled on , telling Doc about Phoebe Nason ; but I , obsessed at last of definite knowledge of the things I hitherto had merely suspected , went to my bunk and sat upon it , wondering what do . In my foolish pride , I had refused to ask , even , where Ellen lived . must see her , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to say to her could not be said in his hearing . It was only Joseph Phipps that I could trust to take me to her and make sure that saw her ; and at once I realized how I could turn Joseph 's lack of pantsgood account . I t was not long before Verrieul returned with Nathaniel ; and when errieul hurried in to get his tin plate and spoon and horn cup from beneath the blanket in his bunk , I caught him and told him he must interpret for me to Joseph on a matter as delicate as it was important . That was how the three of us came to find ourselves , after supper , out the base of the limestone mountain , looking down on the score of campfires that glowed along the edge of the lake , where the workmen had gone to catch and cook eels and hornpout , which bite better at night . " Now , " I said to Verrieul , who translated my words to Joseph in French , and gave me hack the answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your own good , and not to give offense . I hope you will under- ' land . " Joseph said that he understood . " When a man walks with a lady in my country , " I said , " it is considered proper for him to cover up his legs . Therefore I shall be glad to make a gift to you of pants , so that there may be no appearance of Impropriety when you walk with your sister . " " Ile thanks you , " Verrieul interpreted , " and he will be pleased to accept the pants . He prefers red ones . He says to be sure to have the pants made with a seat in them , as he wishes to cut out the seat himself . " " Cut out the seat ! " I exclaimed . " If you cut the seat from a pair occupants , they 're no pants at all ! " 220 RABBLE IN ARMS " But they cover the legs , " Joseph explained . " That is the only reason my people wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when trave ing through rough country , full of thorns . In warm weather , or in op country , pants are unnecessary , uncomfortable , and foolish . " " Foolish ! " I exclaimed . " Look around you at all these men . They 're from Albany and Rhode Island : from all parts of the civilized worl ' All of them wear pants ! Do you think they 'd all wear pants if the were anything foolish about it ? What do you think your sister would s , if I went calling on her without pants ? " Verrieul was slow in interpreting Joseph Phipps 's answer to this que tion , and they spoke back and forth until I became impatient at tl , delay . " Well , what 's the matter ? Ca n't he answer a simple question . l " Yes , " Verrieul said , " but your question put him in mind of soma thing else . He says your question does n't require an answer because is making no effort to persuade you to go without your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is for you to do as you please , without worrying about what he will think , or what his sister will think . He als says that yesterday , in passing the shipyard , his sister was unable to se you at work in your usual place , and spoke of it to him . Today she looke even more carefully to discover where you were working , and expresse surprise that you should be absent . She asked whether you had gon away , or had fever . Because of her persistence in speaking of the ma ter , he says , it is more than likely that she wishes to talk to you abo something . " " Well for God 's sake , " I said , abandoning my concern over Joseph pantsless state , " what made him delay telling me ? If I had n't had o. casion to speak to him , I might have been weeks learning about i This is a hell of a way to treat an important message ! There 's no thin , to be lost ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once ! " Even before Verrieul had interpreted my reply , Joseph Phipps w. off through the scrub that fringed the foot of the limestone mountai and Verrieul and I followed as best we could through the thick hot dar a ness of that July night . The house we sought was in a field  --  that I could tell from the sweet - smell of drying hay  --  and through the kitchen window we saw Elie seated at a table on which burned three tallow dips . Near her sat worn , stooped woman , her grayish hair slicked back on her head like thin silk . The two of them were sewing ; and Ellen , I could see , wa talking ; while , on the far side of the hearth , a man sat asleep in barrel chair . The man , Verrieul said , was the woman 's husband . When Joseph Phipps tapped on the window , the husband spran : from his chair and flattened himself like a squirrel against the chimneyRABBLE IN ARMS 221p221piece , reaching for the musket that hung against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood peacefully enough on the hearthstone , yawning and scratching the back of his neck . Ellen came to the window to peer out . Her brother said something in Drench . Her hand went suddenly to her throat ; then fluttered up to touch her brown curls , a touch behind and at the side , such as women find necessary , no matter how their hair is dressed . She came out , then , and stood in the doorway , a slender gray shape . " Ah , " she said , " it 's you ! " I put out my hand , thinking she might give me her own . When she did n't , I touched her arm , but she just stood there , motionless . I heard Verrieul 's and Joseph 's voices , speaking softly in Abenaki , as they went back through the darkness toward the lake . My hand that had touched her sleeve felt rough and clumsy . I waited for her to speak ; and the two of us were so long silent that I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " Joseph thought --  " I began , but the loudness of my voice , in the dark stillness , choked me and I was silent again . Ellen moved a little , and I imagined a heavy warmth came out from her and struck against me . " Evidently it was not important , what he thought . " " I came as soon as I could , " I said . " I did n't know  --  I was surprised  --  lie thought you wanted to see me . " She moved impatiently . " That 's true , in a way . I was very much put out because you did n't come here to inquire concerning my wishes . " " Of course , " I said , " I 'd have come if I 'd suspected  --  I mean , I was afraid you would n't be pleased if I  --  that is , I was afraid I would n't be t welcome . " " Not welcome ? Why do you raise the question of being welcome ? t I did not wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so that I might learn how long it would be before you proposed to send me to Albany . " I wondered how to speak to Ellen of the things Cap Huff had told me , and I could n't figure how to do it . When she spoke again , her voice was graver . " How long do you expect to be here in this place ? " " I do n't know . Until the fleet is built . " " And how long will that be ? " " Cod knows ! If we can get enough men from Maine , we 'll build it In a month ! " " Men from Maine ? " she asked politely . " I haves nothing aboutp222men from Maine to make me think they 're more capable than men from other parts of America . " I saw fit to ignore the implication in her words . " They know how to build ships , and that 's more than can be said for a lot of the men they 're sending us . If we get many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I see , " she said coldly . " So you 'd be willing to leave me here forever , too , if you ca n't get your wonderful men from Maine . I think you 've , forgotten I 'm to be sent to Albany when I can be sent safely . Since that 's now possible , why do n't you send me ? " " Ellen , " I said , reluctant to answer because of my unwillingness to hurt her , " this doorway 's no place to stand and talk . " " I 'm quite comfortable , " she assured me . " When am I to be sent to . Albany ? Does the doorway prevent you from answering a simple question ? " " No , " I said , " I can answer your simple question if you 'll answer one equally simple . What is it your aunt wants you to do in Albany , Ellen ? " " Ah ! So you 're at my aunt again ! " " Yes , I am ! Until I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm  --  well , I 'm afraid to have you go there . " " You 're afraid ? " Ellen asked softly . " You 're afraid of something that might happen to me ? " " Not exactly . Not in the way you mean . But I 'm afraid for you  --  afraid that innocently you might  --  afraid that through something you might innocently do --  " " What are you trying to say ! Do you think I 'll understand you better if you hem and haw ? " " Very well , " I said , " I 'm afraid you might innocently do something to hurt the American cause . " " I see , " Ellen whispered . " You know that I love my aunt , and you choose to think she 's a spy . " " Wait , Ellen ! You 've spoken of Marie de Sabrevois , again and again , as your aunt ; but in reality , she 's nothing at all to you . You know nothing about her . You do n't know where she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's true , is n't it ? " Ellen 's reply was quick . " Such a question is even more foolish than it is insulting . My aunt is the sister of the gentleman who purchased my mother and me from the Indians . He was a great gentleman , Henri Guerlac de Sabrevois . I ca n't remember my mother , or Monsieur Guerlac ; but my aunt Marie came to me , often and often , in the convent , to tell me how kind he was , and how generous and brave , and how he wished me always to be a lady , like my mother . "  |p223She  stopped . I was uncomfortable , not knowing whether or not she was weeping ; but when she went on , her voice was almost expressionless . " I 'll ask you to remember that I know nothing about you , and yet I 've trusted you , though you have n't been punctilious in repaying my trust . Therefore I see no reason why you should feel free to complain that I know nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educated all my life ! I ask myself why it is you should try to turn me against my aunt , who has been always sweet and always kind ; why you should say I know nothing about her . If you 'll think a moment , you 'll see that I know her brother was an officer in a great French regiment , the regiment of Beam . I know she loved and honored him . I know she was kind to me : kinder than anyone . What more is there for me to know ? Do you , perhaps , know more than that about your mother ? " I touched her arm again : felt for her hand and took it in mine . It was clenched and , in spite of the warmth of the evening , cold . " Ellen , you do n't understand . I 've heard things --  " She freed her hand carefully . " Heard ! You 've heard things ! I understandthe things you 've heard have not been reliable . I understand that if you wished to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know better what she is than anyone alive ! But you wo n't listen to me ! You try to poison my mind against her ! You try to poison your brother 's mind against her ! And I think I understand even more ! I think I know why you want to cast suspicion on her ! I think I know why ! " " You think you know why ? " I was stunned and laughed  --  harshly . " I see . You mean I 'm jealous of her as a man might be jealous of his mother-i n - law . " It was a shot that told ; there was silence for a moment . Then she said huskily , " Well , you promised to send me to Albany . Will you send me ? " " No , " I said , " I ca n't . It 's  --  well , it 's not safe . Ellen , I want you to listen --  " There was the sound of a light thump , and the click of a latch . I felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood of the door she had closed in my face . " Ellen , " I called . " Come back , Ellen ! " I held my breath and listened . Beyond the closed door I thought I heard faint footsteps , mounting a stair . I ran to the kitchen window . I t was dark . " Ellen ! " I called again . " Ellen ! " I stood there and stood there , strainingmy senses for a sound or a sign , but found neither . My lips were dry , and my back drenched with perspiration from the discomfort o my thoughts . How much , I asked myself , could I tell Ellen , even if she relented Marie de Sabrevois was using her : of that I was certain . What else she was trying to do , there was no way of knowing . . . . A hellcat , Cap Huf had called her . There was nothing , he had said , she would n't do . The house was dark and silent . I turned and took my bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the limestone mountain.  |p225TIE  sun , striking down on the deck and sides of the sloop rowgalleyon the following afternoon , made her into an oven hot enough to hake beans ; and I , helping to fit lockers in her powder-magazine , was more than half blinded by sweat . When I climbed on deck to clear the caked sawdust from my throat , the first person I saw , standing disconsolately among the litter of chips and shavings that surrounded the gundelo on the adjoining stocks , was the stooped , slick-haired woman I had last seen sitting across the table from Ellen Phipps . Distress was so marked , both in her attitude and the expression of her face , that I went straight to her . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . " Is anything wrong with Ellen ? " She eyed me doubtfully . " By your looks you 're related to Nathaniel Merrill . " " I 'm his brother . What 's wrong ? " " If you know where he is , you better find him . Ellen 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head . " Some time between sun-up and dinner . That cathen brother of hers , he was around , half naked ; and pretty soon ey went off together , same as always , and they never come back . " I would have spoken , but she forestalled me . " When she was n't back r dinner , I looked in her room . She tooken a dress with her , and the ecasins she made , and some night things . She ai n't coming back : It 's certain ! " Assuming a confidence I was far from feeling , I assured her Ellen as in good hands and would come to no harm . When the woman dged away , stoop-backed from her labors and apparently not even are of the hammering and shouting and half-built vessels that suruudedher , I went in search of Nathaniel on the run . He was , I knew , ' taring timbers for the last gundelo to be laid down , because I had urd him complaining to Verrieul that he was doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own job , which was not far from the truth . From the defiant look on his face , when I found him , I could see he ew what had happened . " Come down to the edge of the lake , " I said . " I want to talk to you . "  | He came quietly enough . We waded out to a boulder where we cool . sit and sharpen his axe with a flat rock . Thus we were free from inter ruption , and there was no make-believe to our work , since even still w were without grindstones , and our axes , as a result , duller than hoe most of the time . " Nathaniel , " I said , " Ellen 's gone , and Joseph Phipps went with her . Nathaniel scooped up water and trickled it on his axe-blade , but sal . nothing . " Since Joseph was subject to your orders , " I said , " I suppose you knew he was going , and with whom . " " Yes . " " Nathaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with care , " why did n't you speak to me before you gave Joseph permission to go ? You must have known that if I 'd wanted Ellen to go to Albany , I 'd have sent he myself . " Nathaniel laughed . " What was the use of speaking to you ? She wa bound to go to Albany . Nothing you could have said would hay . changed her . Why would n't she be bound to go to Albany , knowin : that the sooner she went there , the sooner she could get back to see to see her aunt . " " Oh , so that 's it ! After she goes to Albany , she 's going back to S. John 's . " Nathaniel was silent . " I begin to understand your willingness to have her go , " I said . do n't doubt you were eager to have her go , even , seeing that she cowl ' carry a letter to Marie de Sabrevois for you . " Nathaniel 's glance was hard and level . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 's the harm in it ? Ca n't you see the harm in it , witho my telling you ? Does n't it seem to you possible that you 've done dangerous thing ? That innocent child knows all we 've been doing he in Skenesboro ! And what 'll she do ? She 'll tell Marie de Sabrevois ! " . " Well , why should n't she ? " Nathaniel asked . His voice sounded ha strangled . " Why should n't she ? " " Why should n't she ? I 'll tell you why she should n't ! Do you kno who Marie de Sabrevois is ? Do you know what she 's done ? Who s was with when we --  " Nathaniel jumped up to stand over me , his axe in his hand . eyes were hot . " Sit down on that boulder ! " I told him . " What are you trying to Let all Skenesboro find out what a fool you 've been ? " Nathaniel seated himself slowly , his tanned face a sickly yellow .

" " Lower your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to have every Patriot between here and Crown Point know I 've got a traitor for a brother ! " Nathaniel shivered . " Now wait , Peter ! This is my country ! It 's as much Inc as it is yours . I was born in it and brought up in it ! It 's mine ! I love Just as much as you love it ! Do you think , for God 's sake , that somebody made a special deed of gift of it to you ? That you 're the only one ' titled to have affection for it ? " " Certainly not , " I said , " but --  " " Listen , " Nathaniel said , " it 's my country ! I would n't live anywhere c in the whole damned world if you gave me all of it !

From the way this army has been treated what we need is a rat-charmer to coax the rats out of Congress an drown ' em ! " " Now look here ! " I said . " Wait a minute ! You ca n't talk like that ! " Nathaniel 's voice trembled . " Why ca n't I ? I 'll say what I please about people who leave me i Canada with nothing but dried peas to eat and no rum to warm me  --  n powder to put in my gun in case the British catch up with me -- n clothes or shoes or medicines ! Is there anything too bad to say about those that sit at home , with full bellies and in comfortable houses , putting incompetent muttonheads over me as officers , like this Dutch don key Wynkoop  --  that expect me to stand up here sick and naked and fight the British with my bare fists ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I say they 're rats ; and I say the British 'll tear us t pieces as easy as they 'd tear a rotten sheet ! " " You 'll lower your voice , " I said , " or I 'll give you a thrashing ! " Nathaniel eyed me defiantly . " Ca n't you see ? " he pleaded . " Ca n't you see that all we 've got to do is wait  --  wait till we 're no longer shoeless powderless , shipless , naked paupers  --  wait till we 're stronger , so we cat laugh at England and turn our backs on her without forcing thousands t ( die of smallpox , and making other thousands starve to death , and stand ing still other thousands up to die in front of British muskets ?

" I stepped off the boulder into the milk-warm water : doused myself in it to soften the shell that seemed to have stiffened on me at m1 brother 's words . I could hardly think , let alone speak . I climbed back or the boulder , somewhat clearer-headed , to study Nathaniel . What I had heard was bad  --  bad ! Yet there was so much truth in it that I could n't let myself think about it . " Nathaniel , " I said , " it sounds to me as if you considered going over t the British . In that case I 've got this to say : I wo n't have it ! Before I'd --  " Save your breath ! " Nathaniel said . " I gave you my word I 'd go wit you , and so I will ; but I did n't give my word to stop having my own thoughts !

But keep your hands and tongue o ! me ; and what 's more , keep your slanders off Marie ! Otherwise I 'll do what you 're doing : I 'll follow the dictates of my conscience ! I 'll do what I think ought to be done , instead of what a lot of rats tell me I ought to do ! " I sat and stared at him . I could do nothing but stare , for his words had stripped me of all coherent speech . For a moment Nathaniel returnedmy stare : then he climbed off the boulder and went splashing toward shore . As I followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that I slipped and stumbled as I walked . What to do about Marie de Sabrevois was the question that engrossed I me . I longed to speak with someone about her ; yet I knew Cap Huff might somehow have been mistaken about her name . It was even possible that there might be two Marie de Sabrevoises . After all , there was e a settlement of that name , not far from St. John 's . And of course , I told t myself , it was possible that Ellen was right about her aunt 's goodness : s that Nathaniel was right about her purity and nobility . It was certain I could not talk about her to Nathaniel or to Ellen . It was equally certain that for their sakes I dared not speak about her to anyone else . Nor , I said to myself , could I prove what I knew about Marie de Sabrevois ; but know it I did ; and dodge and squirm as I might , there was no escaping It.  |p230GivE  a man enough work to do and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain about his food , for if he works long enough and hard enough , any food becomes savory , just as any bed feels soft and welcome . We had worked hard enough before Ellen went away ; but she was no sooner gone than the seeming hopelessness of the task that lay before us set us to working harder than ever , with Wynkoop ordering us to do something , and almost immediately deciding to have us do something else ; so that even had we possessed the tools and materials with which to build ships properly , much of our efforts would have been wasted . As it was , the vessels on the stocks seemed no further advanced , each day , than they had been the day before . Nothing existed for us save the building of ships : nothing else , it almost seemed , had ever existed , or ever would . To me , the marshes and the cool breezes of Arundel became misty memories : Ellen , even , seemed as remote as those long-gone days when I walked my own quarterdeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from Ticonderoga brought us diversified information  --  howPennsylvanians were fighting daily with New Englanders ; how General Gates , after replacing Sullivan as Commander of the Northern Army , had ordered the entire army out of Crown Point and back to Ticonderoga , giving Arnold the job of moving it back ; how Congress , early in July , had signed a Declaration of Independence , making us free and independent of Great Britain . What we wanted to know , however , was when in the name of God we 'd get blacksmiths , oarmakersand the million other things that we needed ; but they did n't know the answers . It was as Cap Huff said : a Declaration of Independ ence was a nice thing to hang on the wall , maybe ; but if somebody didn ' send us a few tons of spikes and oakum before long , the British would blow hell out of us , the Declaration and everything else ; so what was th use of mentioning a Declaration of Independence before we got a fespikes ? We had our first encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts from the Wood Creek road and the sound of a fife pla ing Yankee Doodle , extremely brisk and cheery . We ran down the hill ,  |p231d  so did most of the carpenters who were sitting around the new barracks and Skene 's barn ; for a fife was something we had n't heard for any a day . There , coming into the ravine , was a company of fifty , iiiging along in double file as fast and regular as soldiers , only instead muskets they carried axes . At their head was Dominicus Davis , the  --  st calker in our Arundel shipyard . Beside him , tooting the fife , was ti of James Gould 's children , though I could never tell them apart , he having had twelve by his first wife and eight by his second . I t was not Dominicus , nor the fife , however , that moved me , but a all flat-backed figure , marching beside the column and nearly at its ; nor did I recognize that figure until I heard Cap Huff bawling for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a moose to fall step beside it . It was Steven Nason 's wife , Phoebe . She wore tow-cloth leggins ked into moccasins and held up with a red sash over tow-cloth ' ; and her blue-checked shirt was open at the neck . A blue handrchiefwas knotted around her head ; and at her throat was a string of own beads . When she came nearer I saw that dust had caked black on  --  r lips , so I knew she had traveled hard through the hottest part ofe day . Nevertheless there was a cheerfulness to her smile that put me  --  mind of an eager spaniel : never too weary to be alert and gay . " I promised these men they 'd have the best there is , " I heard her tell p . " Find Steven and look after it , and I 'll see you after we 've reported d got ' em settled . " She left Cap and trotted ahead to the front of the line . I saw her hinting to Skene 's big house . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that greeted these welcome newcomers as . y swung up the slope . Just to look at Phoebe , later , as she sat beside our fire , eating Zelph 's e and catfish stew , was enough to hearten us ; but she had news that more heartening still . She had come by way of Rumford ; then had cut across to the Hudson I up it , so her charges might have good roads on which to make  --  ecl marches . " There were two regiments in Saratoga , " she said . " Connecticut regiants , with a brigadier general in command . " She eyed Cap Huff meanly . " They 're bound for here , so to stand guard over you and see you d to work , instead of spending your days in riotous living . " " Connecticut regiments ! " Cap growled . " Pirates ! They 'll be trying to off their clay coffee beans and wooden nutmegs on us ! " " Who 's the general ? " Nason asked  | " Waterbury , " Phoebe said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another general I never heard o . Why in God 's name do n't they send us a general that knows something somebody like Arnold or Schuyler ? " " I do n't know how true it is , " Phoebe said , " but Waterbury 's men clai they 're coming to join Arnold . According to them , it 's Arnold and Wat , bury who 'll be in charge of building the fleet . " " In charge hell ! " Cap muttered . " They ca n't chew hay and spit spikes and oakum , can they ? " More hopefully he added : " If that 's true about Arnold , maybe he 'll let us undress those two regiments , if they g. clothes , and calk the vessels with their pants . " " You seem to think , " Phoebe said , " that oakum and nails grow o trees down our way , and can be picked and sent up to you on five minutes ' notice . If I did n't know you 'd spent most of your life in Kittery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yours , that you must be some kin . of foreigner  --  most likely an Englishman . Oakum and nails are n't t , easy to find during the best of times ; and now that everybody 's got t privateering fever , you 're as apt to stumble on a hundredweight oakum as on a litter of sables . Do n't think you 're the only people in t world that have troubles ! You do n't know what trouble is till you st , interfering with somebody who 's making money out of the war ! " " Well , for God 's sake ! " Cap roared . " They expect us to fight for ' e do n't they ? " Phoebe ate the last of her corn pone and rose to her feet to re-tie h. red knitted sash . " I would n't put it just that way , " she said . " They do n't know any mo about war and fighting than a five-year-old girl knows about having baby . They know they 've got a lovely chance to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . What they expect is that somebody 'll keep the war from stopping till they 've made all the money there is . She added dryly , " Their idea of a nice war is one that 'll last about fifty years . " " The semi-circle of men , sprawled on the ground before our bun house , stared at her . Their eyes were glassy in the red glow of the coo fire . Nobody , seeing their tattered breeches , their stockingless legs , t shreds of cloth that hung around their upper bodies , masquerading shirts , could have dreamed that they were men who had known co . fortable homes and a decent way of life : that Nason owned an inn , an a good one ; that Verrieul had won the approbation of the president Dartmouth College ; that Tom Bickford had set his heart on being a clergyman ; that Whitcomb had been a justice of the peace ; and that myRABBLE IN ARMS 233 ) gather would even still be welcome in the mansions of his Salem classmates . We looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carleton called us in an open proclamation within that very month  --  " rebels , traitors in arms against their King , rioters , disturbers of the public peace , plunderers , robbers , assassins , murderers . " And not only had all this happened to us in three short months of war , but it was only by the grace of God we were not rotting with a thousand other smallpox victims in the dead pits of Isle aux Noix . " Fifty years ? " Nason asked softly . " They want the war to last fifty years ? It 's not quite that bad , I guess . " Phoebe smiled at him , a lop-sided smile , and twisted her fingers in her brown beads . " No , you naturally would n't guess so . I only mention it so on wo n't be impatient with those of us that aim to help you . There 's a Jot of talk , at home , about patriotism . If you believe all you hear , everyone 's a Patriot ; but when you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's another story ! Fifty ship carpenters marched up here with me to work on these ships , and only seven came  --  f their own free will , to help the army ! Only seven ! You could n't get the rest of ' em away from the privateersmen unless you filled their hats with money and gave ' em as much live-stock as Noah carried in the Ark . Dominicus Davis and my cousin Theodore Marvin , they came for whateverpay we want to give ' em , and they 'll ship on the fleet when it 's lady to sail ; but Enoch Cluff , from Wells , he would n't come till he 'd got fifty dollars hard money and nine cows , the cows to be let out to the persons that paid ' em , and doubled in four years ' time . Do you know bow many cows Enoch Cluff 'll have by the time this war 's over ? " Cap Huff heaved himself about , and produced from some portion of Is rags the stub of a pencil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe , " he said , " but you 're mistook ! Just let me have the names of the seven that come of their own free will . " Phoebe ignored him . " Why , we had to offer ' em more than money and cows . Money and cows was n't enough ! When we offered ' em money and  --  ws to come up here and help stop the British from splitting the in two , they shook their heads and said No , they guessed they 'd stay where they were , on account of their labor 's being so valuable to the country ! Valuable ! " She hitched at her red sash and shook her fist at Steven Nason . " Do you know what I 'd do in time of war ? I would n't let anybody  --  not anybody  --  makemore money than a soldier makes ! I 'd oblige every man to go in the army unless he could swear he was so poorly he had n't eatenit one meal a day for a month , and that a small one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't advise letting anyone off on that account . Half a meal a day is all you get in this army , and it ai n't harmed us yet . " Nason looked at his wife as though lost in perpetual admiration of her , which I think he was . " How 'd you contrive to get ' em to come , Phoebe ? " She tossed her head . " We scared the privateer builders ! We went to ' em and showed ' em what would happen unless they made sure we got ship carpenters . After we scared ' em , they told off carpenters to go to the fleet . Sometimes they even gave us the money to pay the wages the carpenters demanded . " " How 'd you scare ' em ? " " We told ' em the truth . Told ' em that if they did n't help us build a fleet on the lake , their privateers would n't ever make any money for them on account of not having any home ports to come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold all the ports in America , so there would n't be anything for the privateers to do but sail around in circles in the middle of the Atlantic . " Cap Huff looked at me . " I told you she was smart ! " Phoebe eyed him darkly . " That shows you what shipbuilders have come to on the coast . I would n't choose to see people in this section making fools of themselves in the same way . I hope I wo n't hear o anyone whining , or being afraid of shadows , or such-like nonsense . S. far as I can see , you have n't anything to be afraid of . The fifty shi. carpenters I brought up here today are as good ship carpenters as you 'll find anywhere , and I want ' em treated right , because the better they 're treated , the more work they 'll do . " She stared hard at Cap , who set up an unmusical humming , like an enormous bee . " What 's more , " she went on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two regiments of men that can handles felling-axes , unless they were brought up to he nursemaids or hair dressers , which they probably were n't . " " Felling-axes ! " Cap bawled suddenly . " Where do you think --  " HG breathed heavily and was silent when Phoebe brandished a brow forefinger in his face . " Twelve hundred felling-axes left Albany yester day , thanks to Schuyler , and two tons of oakum ! Let me tell you , too I 'd rather be you , sweating over nothing worse than how to build ship without spikes and oakum , than be Schuyler , and he responsible for getting the oakum and the nails ! Yes , and that 's not all ! Connecticut ma be full of pirates and wooden nutmegs and clay coffee beans , as you imply , but you can thank your stars for her governor ! He 's sending eigh hundred more felling-axes by way of Bennington ; and Waterbury 's men '  |p235claim  he 's sending the best privateer captain in the state to sail one of our vessels . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ate , and had a governor a third as able as Trumbull , New York could hip three Englands , all by herself ! " A soldier in a brown uniform with crossed belts came out of the darkssto stand on the far side of the fire . We recognized him for one of ose who had accompanied Wynkoop from Ticonderoga . " Steven anon , " he said . " Steven Nason hereabouts ? " Nason got up quickly . Phoebe moved close to him and stared at the soldier from behind her husband 's broad back like a child peering nand a tree . " Message from General Arnold , " the soldier said . He held out a letter . son took it , going down on one knee beside the fire to worry it openread it . Phoebe leaned against him and looked over his shoulder . When Nason rose slowly , Phoebe hooked a finger in his belt . " I could y here till you got back , Steven . I could stay here and sail with the -t . I can sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Start back early tomorrow morning . They need i at home . " " His eyes traveled from one to the other of us . Whitcomb jumped to his feet . " I ai n't much of a carpenter , and seeing how there 's so many Connecticutters coming up here , and seeing asI 'm a Connecticutter myself , it appears to me the thing to do is to t rid of a few Connecticutters , starting with me . " Nason looked unimpressed . " It was me that got you the boats for the ship timbers , " Whitcomb hided him , " and I was told that if I came down here , I 'd get to go out scout duty . That 's what your letter 's about , ai n't it ? " Nilson nodded . " All right : I 'll take you . Pack up . We 're starting north ight . " He himself followed Whitcomb into the bunkhouse , and oche went too , her finger still hooked in her husband 's belt . The rest of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homely things : how Nason 's mother had a felon on the third finger ofleft hand from jabbing herself with the scissors , but was otherwise 11 ; how the clog Ginger had eleven puppies , and two had been saved , h black with white waistcoats : how six barrels of herring had been ted for fear the winter would be a hard one ; how she had brought him woolen shirt from his mother and woolen stockings from his sister lie , and a package of needles , yarn and darning cotton from herself . " It does n't seem quite right , Steven , " we heard her say , " for you to 11 off like this before I have a chance to do your mending , even . "  | Nason laughed . " You 'll have enough of that , Phoebe , before you 're through . " " Well , " she said , " there 's generally something to be thankful for . Thank goodness I got here when I did ! Thank goodness I did n't get here two hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of knowing , for not even Cap Huff had a word to say ; but what I thought was that we , too , had more to be thankful for than I had hitherto realized.  |p237PhoEBE  's INFORMATION proved to be as accurate as it had been wel-. me , and in two days ' time Skenesboro was not only alive with Conecticutters ; but from a distance the little row-galley and two of thegundelos had the appearance of pale bee-hives a-swarm with bees . Men ung and crawled on them from bulwarks to keelson , plunking the newoakum into them with calking irons Steven Nason had made in Skene 's hi iron-foundry . General Waterbury , attended by Wynkoop , came down among us , a ay-headed man with gray sidewhiskers , walking with his left shoulder rust a little forward , as if pushing into a gale of wind . He was as old as y father , nearly ; and from the way he eyed Wynkoop , he was no moreuvorably impressed by this fresh-water admiral than the rest of us had  --  en . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-'reign language of his , telling about gundelos , and about some mighty  --  ave fighting he had done in the last war against the French. 1t seemed to me that Waterbury 's face , as he listened , grew grayerd grayer ; but he said nothing : just went pushing ahead , crab-like , his es darting quick glances at the partly finished vessels . There was a sour look about Waterbury 's mouth that should have  --  . en a warning to Wynkoop ; but being the sort of man he was , Wynoptalked on and on , making no effort to understand the things he w . Now I do n't know whether Waterbury sent for Arnold , sensing that ere would be grievous trouble and delay unless Wynkoop was resolvedentirely from the neighborhood , or whether Steven Nason , on resportingto Arnold , had told him how Wynkoop had insisted that only undelos be built and so spurred him to quick action . The fact remains that Waterbury was scarcely settled in Skene 's big house when a human  --  nnbshell burst in the middle of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time when we had left t . John 's , half a jump ahead of the British light infantry , that a bateau with a patched lug sail came running into the narrow end of the lake an the wings of a hot northwest wind . She headed straight for the fin- ished row-galley , veered sharply inshore and hit the shingle with a clatter . The lug sail came down on the run , and at the same moment the stocky , blue-clad figure of Arnold leaped from the bateau , ran limping to the galley , and , without bothering with a ladder , went up one of the posts of the staging hand over hand . He shot himself in over the bulwarks as easily as a boy vaults a fence , ran to the main hatch and peered down it : then turned to the quarterdeckwhere I , working on the taffrail , stood open-mouthed , wondering whether to tell him about the row-galleys now , or wait until later . He laughed silently , his teeth tight together . " Good ! A tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Any time , " I said . " Tomorrow . " " That 's right ! Get her in ! Where 's the plans for that Spanish galley ? " " In my bunk up yonder . " " Get ' em ! " he said . " Get ' em ! " He limped aft , down the steep slope of the deck , to stand beside me : hung over the larboard taffrail to squint forward : crossed to the starboardtaffrail and did likewise : then faced me and nodded approvingly . " Good ! " he said again . " Come up to headquarters , right away ! We 'll get at it ! " He sprang up on the taffrail , jumped into space , caught at the staging  --  and went down a post , hand under hand . Regardless of the questioning of the carpenters who swarmed aroun. me on his departure , I scrambled to the ground and ran for the bunkhouse . The very act of running brought home to me the difference betweenArnold and every other officer with whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed them . When Arnold gave orders , men ran to obey them . .. . The windows of the front corner room of Skene 's big house were open as I came up the slope , and Arnold 's high , rasping voice brought me up the steps in a hurry . In the corner room I found General Water bury , slumped in a chair behind a roughly made table , his lips pursed in a sour smile , while Arnold leaned over the table and thumped it with his fist to emphasize his words . At the end of the table sat Wynkoop , stolid and motionless , except for his beady black eyes , which fol g lowed Arnold 's movements as if hopeful of catching him in a blunder " Why , " Arnold said , as I came in , " if they 'd put a tenth  --  yes , by God a hundredth  --  of the effort into building this fleet that they do into build ing their measly , pocky privateers , we could blow Burgoyne halfway to Portugal ! "  |p239Ile  turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over his shoulder to Waterbury , he added , " This is Captain Peter Merrill of Arundel . He sailed his ern brig to Spain , and I figure on having him handle one of ours for us . " To me he said : " Where 's those drawings ? " I handed him what I had  --  drawings made on cartridge paper . He unrolledthem and spread them on the table in front of Waterbury , weightngthe corners with rocks ; then shot a quick glance at me . " As I understand it , " he said , " you have n't laid down any row-galleyst . No sir , " I said . " We started to do so , but there was n't sufficient martialto let us get forward with them . " There was nothing to be gained by telling tales on Wynkoop . Arnold Is a smart man , and a smart man knows what 's going on without being hl much . Arnold nodded . He went to stand beside Waterbury and study the ans . " Yes , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keel ought to be laid tomorrow  --  tomorrow ! " To Waterbury he said , " This is a Spanish galley , general . The Spaniards use ' em , and the Algerines too . Just fitted for it purpose , they are : short masts : lateen sails : a minimum of canvas and cordage to bother the landsmen that 'll have to sail ' em . We ca n't do any better so long as we 're forced to build small . " Wynkoop reached for the plans and drew them over where he could examine them .

" " Ve ken buildt four gundelos in der time it dakes for vun of dese gels , " Wynkoop objected . " Alretty ve got tree big wessels ! " Arnold balanced on his toes , pushing his lower lip out and in , as if cling a roughness on his upper lip . " Big ? " he asked politely . Then he laughed . " We 've got two schooners and a sloop , all mounting sparrow Ills ! Sparrow guns ! That 's how big they are ! Four-pounders and two -- pounders : that 's their armament ! What do you expect to sink with two-pounders , Colonel ? You could n't sink a washtub with two-pounders , notunless you boarded it and scuttled it to boot !  | " As for our gundelos , what good would they be against a vessel like this ?

" " Der more gundelos ve heff , " Wynkoop said heavily , " der more ve'l sgare der British . After ve sgare ' em , ve 'll heff to vight ' em on lend , enyvay . Loogit all der wessels der English het at Quebec , and der whol ding het to be zettled on land by Volfe , wessels or no wessels ! " Arnold glanced wryly at Waterbury , who scratched the corner of his mouth . To Wynkoop Arnold said : " I 'm glad you spoke of that , Colonel . I 've had occasion to give considerable thought to the manner in which Wolfe took Quebec . " He tapped the table . " Wolfe was n't the man that took Quebec , though he 'll always get the credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Charles Saunders , moving his fleet up river with every flood tide , and down river with every ebb , perpetually threatening to disembarkhis men here , there and everywhere , day and night . He wore Montcalm out . Montcalm was in a panic for fear of what Saunder might do . If it had n't been for Saunders , Wolfe would n't have had on . chance in a thousand of even reaching the Plains of Abraham ! Not one chance in a million ! " Wynkoop puffed and made sounds of expostulation . " If you want the real truth about Quebec , " Arnold said , " here it is : Wolfe should have been court-martialed for putting his troops where he did , and Montcalm should have been court-martialed for abandoning an impregnable fortress to fight in an open field ! " He laughed harshly . " Wolfe and Montcalm ! Montcalm and Wolfe ! Two blunderers ! It was Saunders and his sailors ! Saunders and his ships ! Saunders and his naval discipline ! D' you think either Montcalm or Wolfe could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors did  --  up all night : making sail ; shortening sail ; anchoring ; heaving up the anchor ; hauling around the yards ? Not by a damned sight ! They 'd have deserted ! Saunders and his sailors took Quebec , and the wrong man got the credit , as usual ! " Nothing that Arnold said , I knew , was making the smallest dent in Wynkoop 's stubborn Dutch mind , though it was the simple truth . Arnold eyed him narrowly and spoke cautiously . " In all likelihood , Colonel Wynkoop , this year 's campaign will be settled on Lake Champlain , and I take it that all of us want it settled conclusively in our favor . There 's only one way in which that can be done , and that 's for us to build a fleet superior to anything the British can build . That wouldn'tp241be difficult if we had the men and material , because there 's one thing the British ca n't build , and that 's a frigate . They have n't the depth of water to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the men and the supplies , I 'd build a 38-gun frigate , and the British could n't pass . Since it 's out of the question to get either the supplies or the workmen , we 've got to do the next best thing : we 've got to outbuild them , and it 's my Information that they 've already brought two schooners from the St. Lawrence to St. John 's in sections  --  schooners bigger than any of ours . That means we 've got to build vessels that can maneuver with their schooners . That means row-galleys , Colonel , and it means we ca n't delay any longer ! They 've got to be laid down tomorrow ! " Wynkoop settled himself in his chair as if he intended to stay there all day . " Cheneral Sguyler gafe me der commend of Lake Shemplain , " he said stolidly . " In dot gepecity I belief der broper wessels iss gundelos . I h Dey 're more mople , and petter aple to selegt der bettle ground . " Waterbury looked puzzled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ent so heffy . " " Mobile ! " Arnold exclaimed . " Gundelos mobile ? In dirty weather thy 'd be as mobile as lobster-pots ! " He glared at Wynkoop , his lips pressed tight together , his swarthy lace lumpy . Suddenly he smiled . " As senior officer at this post , " he said carelessly , " I order an immediate Council of War to consider the form of ship construction best adapted to our needs  --  the council to include all officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel . The council will be in order . General Waterbury , what are your views on the type of vessel that would be of greatest service to us ? " " Chust a minute ! " Wynkoop objected ; but his objection was unheededby Waterbury , whose reply to Arnold 's question was magisterial . " I 'm in favor of completing the gundelos now under construction , and In devoting all our efforts to the construction of row-galleys similar to this plan . " He slapped my drawing with his open palm . Wynkoop , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterbury and said , " Those are my opinions exactly , General , and since that disposes of the business before this Council of War , the council stands adjourned . Captain Merrill , lay down the keel of that Spanish galley tomorrow and remain in charge of her until she joins the fleet . "  |p42SKENESBORO  was an ante-room of hell in the weeks that followed ; and our labors turned into a confused and fever-ridden struggle such as sets dreamers to groaning in their sleep . Wherever Arnold could find a sea captain , he laid violent hands on him and hustled him to Waterbury , who put him in charge of the building of the vessel he was to command . He called on the regiments at Ticonderoga for seamen and marines ; and as might be expected , the ones sent were those who could best be spared  --  the sickly and contentious : the thieves and rascals : the worst clad and least trustworthy : men who looked unable to shoot , march or hand a sail  --  men so pocky and so vermin-ridden that to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor as they were , they were marvels of physical perfection by comparison with those collected in New York to serve aboard the fleet  --  or purchased , rather ; for the latter were raked out of alleys and gutters by the offer of a bounty ; and if ever there were human beings who deservedthe title of " sweepings of hell , " which one of our officers gave them , it was they . Like all such sorry offscourings , they held themselves superior to all other men in wit , wisdom and ability ; and when the barracks and the huts were filled with them , there were perpetual howlings and riotings , and fights of terrible ferocity , which nobody seemed able to quell . I longed , often , to see Cap Huff 's hulking figure charge into a brawling , cursing mass of those ragged , uncontrollable creatures , but he had gone away to Ticonderoga to testify in a court-martial which General Arnold had demanded so that Colonel Hazen might be punished for refusing to accept the supplies seized in Montreal , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine seamen to be sent to us , so far as I could see , came marching in through a thunderstorm one afternoon , headed by a quickmovingman with enormous arms : a man seemingly unable to look at anyone or anything without feeling the back of his neck and casting a quick glance at the sky . Nathaniel and I , working in the bow of our galley , found his appearance familiar . When he caught sight of us , hep243uu cc at the back of his neck , and raised a long arm in greeting . I remembered , then , that the same gesture had been made to us from the to.red rowboat we had picked up off Old York a mere three monthst was David Hawley , the Connecticut privateersman who had es  --  d from the Halifax prison , and rowed five hundred miles in a week . e were glad to see him ; glad , too , to have the Connecticut sailors had brought .

Ours , being the largest , had been named the Congress by , ld ; the other three were named for the three mainstays of the NorthArmy  --  GeneralWashington , Governor Trumbull of Connecticut ,  --  General Gates. ' he galleys were growing rapidly , though not as rapidly as they ' Id have grown if we had been free of the attacks of intermittent that laid workmen fiat on their backs by scores , their teeth chat-g and their faces as white and pinched as though the blood had drained from their bodies. here were times when , between our sick , the endless feuds among Pennsylvanians , Yorkers and New Englanders , and the heat and the mosquitoes , we were sure that none of the vessels would ever be hed. et the little Lee galley , built from the timbers we had brought from John 's , was pushed into the water and went off to Ticonderoga , unbedlasted , unmasted , ungunned  --  a raw hulk , rowed by a mob of Yorkersfouled their oars , cursed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red-headed Captain Davis . Davis gave us a as his craft moved slowly northward  --  a wink that indicated he was put-upon than he seemed . Ocher , captain of the Washington galley , stood with Hawley and watching the Lee pull out . Thatcher laughed ironically . " They got considerable to learn , " he said , " and I should n't wonder if Davis learnedHawley caressed the back of his neck . " You got to be charitable at a like this . You got to let ' em get aboard ship . When you get ' em , you can explain to ' em about not making unnecessary noises , and Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do . If you try to ex-n to ' em before you get ' em there , as I understand it , they mightwrite home to a Congressman about it , and you 'd get put in jail for con  --  unbecoming to something or other . " The gundelos Connecticut and Spitfire , too , were thrown in by main strength , they being too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Ticonderoga for guns , sails , powder , shot and t rest of their equipment . And so , in spite of everything , Arnold had the beginnings of a fleet two months from the day when we had started south from Isle aux Noir . Two months to a day had passed when Cap Huff returned fro Ticonderoga  --  a strangely mild and soft-spoken Cap Huff  --  with a m sage from Arnold . He drifted into our bunkhouse about an hour aft . sundown , as quietly as a shadow , and hoarsely whispered , " I got a me. sage for Hawley . Anybody here know Hawley ? " Nathaniel offered to get him , whereupon Cap said , " All right : tell In he 's got to go to Crown Point to take command of the Royal Savage Where 's my rum ? " Doc Means said somebody had discovered Cap 's rum and taken i but that there had been only a small amount in the barrel anyway maybe two quarts . " How do you know there was only two quarts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had other things on his mind . " Sit down , " I said ; " sit down and give us the news . You must be tir. after your long trip .

" He added absent-mindedly that there was no news . " No news ! " I protested . " What 's the reason Arnold sent for Hawley What happened to the captain of the Royal Savage ? What happened to Hazen ? Did n't you go up there to testify on the Hazen court-martial Where 's Steven Nason ? Where 's Whitcomb ? What 's the news of ti British fleet ? How many vessels have they got ? What are they doin How are our vessels getting along ? " " I need some rum , " Cap persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to try on those ship carpenters . " He seemed uneasy . " You ai n't heard anything about Whitcomb ? " We said we had n't . " Whitcomb killed a general , " Cap said . He looked behind him , the sat down close to the fire and asked softly whether anybody had a tout of rum  --  just the merest touch . Doc Means brought him a flask , and Cap drained it at a gulp . H hiccupped grandly , staring absently into the fire . " Whitcomb killed a general ? " I asked . " What kind of general did I kill ? "  | " Listen , " Cap said , " did any of you ever hear me tell this feller Whitcombhe ought to kill some generals ? " I said I did n't remember it . " Well , " Cap said gloomily , " he claims he got the idea from me , and  --  ing as how there 's hell to pay and no pitch hot , I ai n't had a minute 's ' ace for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him when I as feeling my rum a little .

The British , they claim it ai n't sporting , but I m't see why it ai n't . They 'd ' a ' killed Whitcomb fast enough , if they 'd tight him ! " Then he told us . Whitcomb and Steven Nason , sent by Arnold to nn ; hack a prisoner , had traveled all the way to St. John 's , circled the British camps and hidden themselves on the road between St. John 's  --  d Montreal . Whitcomb stayed in one spot for a day and a half , and at e end of that time a general came riding down the road on horseback. nee Whitcomb was afoot , he had no chance to overtake him : yet he independently longed to take back a general to Arnold . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder so not to stave him up too much . He did not , however , plug him hard enough , and the general got ay . As for Whitcomb , Cap said , the British learned his whereabouts d set guards across all the roads , in spite of which he came safely rough them and back to Ticonderoga , as did Steven Nason . " The British were awful mad , " Cap said , " but eight days later they re madder , because they had to bury the general . Here was this feller Whitcomb making the war so dangerous that not even a British General could be safe ! Yes sir : they 'd come three or four thousand miles light this war , and hired Hessians and Indians and everything , so to nke it a good one , and they certainly did n't propose to have the whole easiness ruined by this feller Whitcomb ! They got so nervous over Whitnib , they offered a hundred pounds to anybody who 'd get him , dead ali ve . " " How 'd you learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazen used to live in St. John 's , " Cap said . " One his acquaintances wrote him a letter and told him about it , and the thing we knew , all of Hazen 's friends were hollering about what a terrible thing Whitcomb had done . " " His friends ? Do you mean Easton and Brown ? " " Yes , damn ' em ! " Cap growled . " Easton and Brown and Wilkinson . You remember that little antimire Wilkinson , that little pissmire as was Hold 's aide in Montreal ? "  |p246We  said we did . " Well , " Cap said , " in the first place , he drinks . Yes sir ! If you let that damned little tit-pot smell the cork of a rum bottle , he 'd get drunk and blab everything he knew and a lot he did n't know ; so Arnold would n't have him around any longer .

They could n't been madder about Whit comb shooting the general if the general had been their own dear little sweetheart . It was all Whitcomb 's fault , they said , but it was all Arnold 's fault , too , for sending Whitcomb to Canada . Wilkinson and Hazen and Easton and Brown , they were talking about how Whitcomb was n't a gentleman , and ought to be turned out of the army . They 're afraid i he 's kept , the British army 'll look down on us for low , general-shootin : riffraff . I think they heard some Englishman say so . By God , there 's peple in this country that just ai n't right in their heads ! They 'll believe anything an Englishman or a Frenchman tells ' em : anything !

" Cap spoke plaintively . " Now you take this general that Whitcomb shot ! He would n't have died , ever , if one of those damned doctors had n't got hold of him ; so what 's the use trying to blame Whitcomb for it ! An . for God 's sake , what did they expect Whitcomb to do : wave his hand kerchief at this general ? If Englishmen want to be so all-fired sporting , why do n't they hang the doctor that could n't cure the general of plain ordinary gunshot wound in the shoulder ! " " How did Arnold feel about all this ? " I asked . " Arnold ? Why , Arnold felt just the way I did ! He knew the doctor done it . He never accused Whitcomb of killing no general ! Arnold 's a sensible feller ! He 's got more sense than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arnold said it was too damned bad Whitcomb did n't bring the general back . Whitcomb felt bad , too . He said he and Stevie 'd go up to St. John 's again and catch a couple of live ones . Yes sir : it certainly was a disappointment to Whitcomb . He said when h winged that general and saw him go riding off , hell bent , he felt as bad as he did the time he missed his first moose . Anyway , Whitcomb 's safe , because he 's gone back to St. John 's , where there ai n't nothing to worryp247hold. but the British ; but I ai n't going to feel safe till I get afloat  --  not Ill le Easton and Brown and Hazen and Wilkinson go snooping wind Ticonderoga , thinking up lies to tell about Arnold or anybody ut works for Arnold !

Hawley came out of the darkness , piloted by Nathaniel ; and at the ht of Nathaniel it occurred to me that here was a heaven-sent opunityto put him in a safe place by sending him with Hawley , who 1 ( 1 use him to good advantage . In Hawley 's company he would have occasion to see Easton and Brown ; and he 'd be free of this feverdenpest-hole in which we worked . " What 's all this about the Royal Savage ?

" Cap was indignant . " I never suggested nothing to Whitcomb ! I do n't ally know the feller ! What happened about Wynkoop was that when sold was all ready to have Hazen court-martialed , the court was eked with New Hampshire men  --  friends of Hazen and Bedel . They  --  jaded to everything Arnold started to do . Would n't admit his wit/nesses  --  would n't listen to Arnold  --  would n't do a damned thing ! Wh Arnold complained , they got all excited , and said they 'd never been insulted by nobody , not in all their whole lives , and if Arnold didn apologize , they 'd take their dolls and go home ! " Cap tugged at the collar of his shirt . " By God , if ever there was court that ought to have been shot , it was that one , starting with t president of it  --  Colonel Poor of New Hampshire !

" Gates dissolved the court , it ing made up of old women ; and if he 'd done what he ought to don he 'd ' a ' set ' em to sewing shirts and breeches for the fleet ! Then , on a. count of Arnold having done all the work on the fleet , and being t only officer fit to sail it and fight it , Gates put Arnold in command everything . He made Arnold admiral of the fleet , but he neglected explain it to Wynkoop so 's Wynkoop could understand it . The only w to make Wynkoop understand an order he do n't want to understand to open up his skull with a splitting wedge , and pound in the order wi a sledge-hammer . So Wynkoop , he just did n't pay no attention to nold . Seems as though he figured the Wynkoop family owned La Champlain , and nobody else had no business giving orders on it . when Arnold sent two schooners down the lake on a scout , Wynkoop lays the Royal Savage broadside to ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . Fires on his own ships ! " " Oh , here ! Here ! " Hawley said . " You do n't expect us to believe that " Listen , " Cap said , " maybe you 'll believe it when I tell you Arno climbed aboard the Royal Savage and cussed Wynkoop for ten minute without taking breath ; then put him under arrest and sent him back Gates , to be tied up where he could n't interfere with the war ! 1'h Wynkoop is a pig-nut  --  a Dutch pig-nut , twice as bad as an ordinary pigsnut .

The young maples were frost-nipped ; the heavy with the scent of dying leaves . Skenesboro was a desert of stun and scrub , stripped of trees for Wynkoop 's preposterous stockade a barracks , as well as for ships , stocks , cabins , firewood , oars .

Of all the vessels we had built , only five were left in Skenesboro : t four big row-galleys , crouched in a group , as if at bay at the bottom this devastated valley , and beside them a single gundelo , like the u weaned calf of one of the larger hulks .

She was n yacht ; nor was there anything about her that was beautiful ; but with he guns aboard , she would at least be dangerous . There 's one thing of which I 've been certain since those days : no tas is sufficiently difficult to baffle really determined men . Carpenters fell from the stagings , toward the end of our labors , struc down by fever . It was a common sight to see two men carrying a plan and for one to drop in mid-stride , as if sickness had leaped upon himp251se of us who were left were ragged skeletons , our clothes rottenperpetual sweating : our bodies covered with the sores and bruises sed by over-speedy labor with poor materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we could n't finish the last  --  e galleys ; and yet we finished two of them , if it was possible to call I , hulks " finished .

Smoke from cabins lay in the valley of Wood Creek , a pale shroud for the havoc had wrought . No admiring throng was gathered to see us slip away : two commissaries , some farmers , and a little knot of Negroes. my head were no heroic thoughts ; merely forebodings and darkforebodings as to Nathaniel : as to Ellen Phipps : as to what lay ) re us on these narrow waters , hidden in the chill mist that seemed e to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words Z 1ph , hack in the peaceful clays of long ago : " That 's the nice thing ut a war : there ai n't no regular work to do  --  only wear a uniform , k around a lot , and camp out .

A gill of ruin was issued to the rowers every two hours ; and while the mists of early morning still wreathed the dark h above us , we pulled into the narrow cleft beneath the heights of Tic , deroga to see a sight that looked like war indeed . All the waterways to north and south are pinched together at Tic deroga , as if some clumsy god had squeezed the end of Lake Geor and the narrowest portion of Lake Champlain between enormous gers . The earth is gathered up in abrupt folds ; the waterways t between them ; and overlooking the narrow channel are the gray wt of the old French fort . When we had come down from Crown Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fort had been a ruin , over grown and crumbling , and all the other hills were thick with trees . T place had been a wilderness , without a house or sign of life . Now , as our galley came slowly into that moat between the hills , t. fort 's gray walls had been rebuilt , and from its ports and parapets black guns protruded . Redoubts and magazines squatted on the rocks , a. sentries walked a score of posts . On our left , the shores of Mount D. ante were stripped of trees ; and the once-wooded heights of MoIndependence , at our right , had become a city of tents and cabins fro which the smoke of campfires rose to undulate in layers against the hiUnder the guns of the fort were docks ; whaleboats and bateaux by t hundred were stacked along the shore .

They 'll camp by themselves on the flats to t north until you 're rigged and ready to sail . " " I 'd like to keep ' em aboard ship , " I said , " so to get ' em accustom ; to the craft .

" " That 's too damned bad about the Pennsylvanians ! " I said . " Wha their objection to New Englanders ? " " They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indians " Well , for God 's sake ! " I cried . " Do you have to be elected to this wp253by the Pennsylvanians ? When did they decide nobody could fight the  --  ritish unless registered as gentry ? " I was furious to think that Pennsyliniansor anybody else should question Doc Means 's age or Zelph 's Ior , since either of them was as valuable as any Pennsylvanian I had er seen , bar none . Wilkinson raised his eyebrows . " I 'm not responsible for the way they el , Captain . But I am responsible for keeping order among the troops . Pennsylvanians are obliged to work with New Englanders , there 's always a fight , and somebody gets killed ; so take your men ashore under lard : then report to the general . " " To General Arnold ? " I asked . Wilkinson 's voice was chilly . " General Arnold has no authority at this ) st , as you doubtless recall , now that I mention it . General Gates is commander-in-chief of the Northern Army . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left us ; but his pomsity made no impression on Cap Huff , who emitted an unseemly noise between compressed lips , and hoarsely whispered , " Poop-head ! " By the time the galley had been made fast to the dock and the crew arched off to barracks by Tom , Verrieul and Cap Huff , shears had en set up for handling the guns , and a swarm of shipwrights , armor- , riggers and blacksmiths were hard at work . A company of York troops , lined up in a row , rolled 18-pound shot in man to man , moving them to a spot abreast of our main hatch , ) king and acting like children playing a queer game of marbles . Eight her ragged soldiers lashed a long 18-pounder to four poles , prepararyto bringing it aboard . I made myself as military as I could  --  a difficult task , since my townthsmock , long ago worn to shreds , had been replaced by a buckinshirt whose tails had been cut off to make patches for the shoulders ,  --  that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought from farmer , were too small , and for footgear I had only moccasins , since ors were impossible to get . I had a ribbon for my hair , however , and eph Phipps 's gold-laced hat , which he had let me have in return for a snuff-box . Wilkinson was waiting in the ante-room to the general 's quarters indethe fort on the hilltop ; the general , he told me in a hushed voice , us almost ready for me . I disliked Wilkinson for his unwarranted solemnity , but he was a aide-de-camp , able to look busy when doing nothing , even whileking a nap : able , also , to soothe impatient persons by leading them toink he was about to perform something miraculously important fortheir sole benefit . He was more profound over inconsequential matters than any man I ever knew  --  an excellent trait for a soldier , and one th brings higher rank to the person who practices it than mere bravery ability . It was a great boon to Wilkinson ; for in one year 's time he w @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ponderosity wi. which he delivered it that Congress made him a brigadier general twenty-one , when he deserved a brigadier generalcy about as much our village idiot . When Wilkinson ushered me in to see Gates , I found him fumbli nearsightedly among his papers . He was gray and stooped , with a s side-glance that returned and returned to the person with whom spoke . He looked crafty , as if hopeful of stealing up on a person thoughts , instead of asking frankly for them . Yet he was bluff and hear and seemingly eager to do everything possible to make things easi. for those who had to do the fighting . He got up to shake hands , quite as if my rank were equal to his ow then threw his arms apart in an old-womanish gesture , staring petulant at my clothes . " Captain ! Captain Wilkinson ! " he called querulously . " Here ! I wa . you , dear boy ! " Wilkinson appeared as neatly as though he had shot up through floor . " Now look here , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He flu his hands out before him , seeming to spill from them a burden of di gust . " A captain in our fleet , obliged to fight against soldiers like Carl . ton and Burgoyne in a teamster 's shirt and wearing tobacco-pouchonhis feet ! Now for God 's sake , Wilky , do something about it ! Get hi a coat somewhere ! Get him some breeches and stockings ! And try t. find some shoes for him . Damn it , Wilky , fix him up with some shoes ! Wilkinson looked dubious . " Yes , General , " he said soothingly . " Yo know such things are scarce : scarce ! " Gates 's reply was testy . " Well , of course they 're scarce , dear boy ! I they were n't , he 'd get ' em himself , would n't he ? Now look here , Wilky if you ca n't find clothes in the fort , go over to Mount Independence an talk to some of those York troops . They 've got clothes , some of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have money than breeches , an they 're no better with breeches than without ' em , so there 's no reason why we should n't deprive ' em . We 'll equip Captain Merrill out of th public funds : that 's what we 'll do ; but for God 's sake , Wilky , do n't brin : back clothes that are lousy ! They tell me all the York troops are lousy so if you get clothes from ' em , be sure to have ' em examined , especiall the seams . Have the seams well looked at , dear boy ! " In spite of Gates 's kindness , I could never think of him , after that ,  |p255exce|pt  as something of a fussbudget  --  too much of a fussbudget to be a N-I commander-in-chief . When Wilkinson had departed , grave and splay-footed , Gates sat rwn at his desk again and pawed among his papers . " Well , we thought ' d never get here in time to fight ! " He eyed me slyly over the tops of spectacles. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky to finish the cress and the Washington . " when 'll the Gates be ready ? " m a week , I hope , sir . " y cracky ! I hope so ! We need her ! General Arnold 's been making miserable for us , shouting for those galleys ! We get a letter from him y fifteen minutes . He wants those galleys ! " He poked irascibly ng his papers. hen does he expect to fight ? " whenever he has to , " Gates said , " and I do n't want you to lose a cite  --  not a minute ! We 're putting everybody to work on your galley I Waterbury 's . By cracky , it 'll be a shame if the Gates is n't fit toIt ! " Sir , " I asked , " what 's known about the British fleet ? Have they built vassals bigger than ours ?

( : , rtes pounced on some papers with a grunt of satisfaction . " Now It , here 's General Arnold 's requisitions . For your galley : two eightx , two twelves and four sixes . For the Washington galley , one eighth , one twelve , two nines and four fours . Right ? " " No sir , " I said . " The Congress galley can carry more guns . She ought have two long nines in addition to those named . " tes made the note on the requisition . I tried again to ask what gth the British would bring against us , but he interrupted me . " Acngto my understanding , all these row-galleys have an outlandishLanteen , " I said . " Two masts , with a lateen sail on each . " Gates shook his head . " Never heard of such a thing ! You 'll have to watch on the riggers and see you get what you want . Do n't spend mite here that you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sh come down from St. John 's , and catch Arnold without the ships counting most on ! " it. , " I said , " I 'd like to know whether I can depend on the servicesp256of one of my best men  --  Steven Nason . He went north on a scout a mu ago and --  " Gates stopped me with an uplifted hand : then rose from his desk went to the narrow window that looked out on the parade ground . sentries on the battlements were staring down at some common oh ) of interest ; and I could hear a confused gabbling and cheering . Wilkinson came into the room with an appearance of exaggera coolness , but his jaw muscles were throbbing . " Sir , " he said , " before crossing to Mount Independence , I ventu to prosecute my search for Captain Merrill's --  " " What 's that noise ? " Gates interrupted . " For God 's sake , Wilky , g. the point ! " " Sir , " Wilkinson said , " it 's a messenger from General Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window again : then turned an exaspera glare on Wilkinson . " What two officers ? " " British , " Wilkinson said . " Two British officers . It 's that Whitco again . Whitcomb took them . " There was disparagement and expolation in his voice . " Whitcomb ! " Gates exclaimed . " Whitcomb ! " He hopped slig ejaculating , " Ha ! Whitcomb ! Ha , ha ! Whitcomb ! " as if in uncontrolla delight . The gabbling and cheering grew louder . Through the window we soldiers sweep through the gate of the fort and spread out , fan-wise , the parade ground , to stare at three figures in the center . One Steven Nason . The others were blindfolded and wore gaudy scapgoats . Their waistcoats were scarlet as well , and their white breech snugly bound with black gaiters . On their heads were close-fitting e. of black leather with a metal plate sticking up in the front , as if to p tect their foreheads from bullets . They might have been snatcl straight out of St. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was as interested in them as was the crowd ; for they were the fi Britishers any of us had seen at close range . Gates fussed about his desk , straightening his papers . " Go hack your vessel , Captain , " he told me . " This is an omen ; a good omen ! Y asked me for Nason , and yonder he is , with conquered British  --  v pat ! very pat ! Yes , we 'll take it as a sign from heaven ! " He edged himself into his desk chair , looking up slyly . " That Wh comb ! " he said . He chuckled and chuckled , slapping his hands sof against his desk . " Now we 'll learn something ! Now we 'll learn wl they 're up to ! "  |p257I  WAS late that night before Steven Nason came to the officers ' quartersbeside the crew 's barracks ; but he could have delayed until daybreakand still found Cap Huff awake and waiting . In spite of his reckless and blustering ways , that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he behaved , in Nason 's absence , like a dog deprived of his master : he was forever wandering to the door to sniff the outer air , or growling to himself uneasily , or scratching himself out of pure fretfulness . He practiced dice-throwing with Doc Means , for both had worked interminably to perfect themselves in the finger-twists Zelph had taught them : twists that , if properly executed , caused the dice to fall as the thrower wished them to fall ; but he put no heart in his throwing  --  not even enough to curse when Doc beat him , which he seemed to do almost by accident , especially at such times as large sums of money were supposedly at stake . Since the day Cap had given Doc the pair of dice , Cap had become indebted to Doc in the sum of eight thousand dollars ( Continental ) . When Nason at last arrived , Cap was more than ever like an enoroilsclumsy dog , wagging himself before Nason , patting him with his uge paws , and almost panting with joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use his own words ) picked up four flasks of rum : and these he produced when Nason joined us . " Stevie , " he said , his big face glistening with apprehension , " I hope to od you 're through running around with this feller Whitcomb ! He ai n't safe feller for you to be with ! I ai n't had a minute 's peace since yoi I't north the second time , knowing the risks he takes . " Nason laughed . " Risks ! I suppose you were n't taking risks when you and Verrieul paid a visit to the British and came away with a keg a Ian ! " Cap was scornful . " That 's different ! We had to have that rum . Noxlv has to have British generals . Whitcomb thinks he has to have Brittish generals ; but that ai n't no regular human need , like rum or shirts , qI getting your feet warm . It 's just his imagination . Anyway , besides , we was n't hiding nothing , and we walked right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting around behind ' em and hiding in bushes , the way Whitcomb does . That 's something I just ca n't st Stevie  --  somebody hiding in the bushes and watching what I do  --  a ai n't the only feller that feels that way ! Hiding in the bushes is  | risky , Steven , no matter where it 's done ! " " Where 's our fleet , " I asked Nason , " and how 's it look ? " " It 's moving south , hunting for a likely place to fight , and it might look worse  --  lots worse ! General Arnold 's a seaman if ever I saw one , he 's got another seaman to help him . His name 's Wigglesworth . Hod colonel , but he used to sail ships for Nathaniel Tracy in Newbury '  --  I would n't wonder if Arnold and Wigglesworth are better than anyb. the British can produce . " Meditatively he added , " They 've got so smart men , though , the British have . They 've got a man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can turn into a keel-1 . in five seconds . " " How , for God 's sake ? " " There 's a little slot of a well in the center of it , " Nason said . " There board pinned in the well . If he takes out the pin , the board drops do and makes a keel , and then he can beat to windward . He calls it centerboard . " While I was storing this discovery in my mind for future referen Cap Huff snorted . " Hell , that ai n't nothing ! Anybody could ' a ' thou . of that  --  if he 'd ever just a-happened to think of it . " He was almost rig and I was surprised it had never occurred to anyone before . " Did you find out anything about the British fleet ? " I asked Nas , little dreaming he had acquired information of even greater moment me than the number of vessels we must fight . Nason nodded . " They 've got seven real vessels . They 're big , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell from where we were . Th. they 've got a lot of little gundelos , each one mounting a single hea gun . Six of the big vessels are in the water , and one 's on the stocks sti 1 Whitcomb says the one on the stocks was n't even started three wee ago . They must have laid down her keel after they saw our vessels . " " How many guns do the big ones carry ? " " We could n't be sure . There 's so many British troops around that it ' kind of risky to try to see all you 'd like to see . There 's women , too , an . children ! Their regiments brought three hundred women from Englan with ' em : camp followers . Nearly every soldier brought a dog , and som of the officers brought two or three . Seemed as if you could n't ge within a mile of the shipyard without falling over a camp follower o stepping on a dog ! To tell you the truth , there were times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster-backs from catching us. "  |p259That  ai n't such a hell of a lot of women ! " Cap said . " Only three bunI ? " Then he brightened . " What kind of looking women was they , mostly ? " ' anon ignored him . " So far as we could make out , the two biggest els were schooner-rigged . We could n't tell about the new one . She Iced deep enough to carry a lot of sail . If they started her less than  --  ' weeks ago , the way Whitcomb says , it 's hard to see how she 's going be of much assistance to ' em this fall . " breathed more easily , but not for long. ' ap eyed Nason coldly . " I s'pose you was hiding in the bushes when caught those two fellers . " Of course we were , " Nason said . " We went up past St. John 's , and on the Laprairie road , between St. John 's and Montreal . " Cosh ! " Cap cried . " Whitcomb went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes : he figured that was the safest place . He hid in same clump of bushes that he shot Gordon from . He said the place so well known that nobody 'd ever expect to see him there , and he right . " Cosh all hemlock ! " Cap bawled . " I would n't have nothing to do with her as reckless as that Whitcomb ! Who were these fellers he took ? " One was quartermaster of the 29th Foot  --  name of Saunders . Theher was his servant : a corporal . Not bad men , once they got broke to ways . " I s'pose they was born out of wedlock , " Cap said , " like so many in the British army . " When Nason eyed him sternly , Cap assumed a jovial air . " Listen , ie ; there ai n't no earthly use getting touchy over these fellers . There ' t nothing I can say about ' em , no matter how hard I try or how dirty lk , that 'll be half as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Prob'ly this Saunders offered you half a dollar to turn him e . " ' Well , " Nason admitted , " they offered us twenty dollars apiece to let em go , but we did n't see fit to accept . " 1 should hope not ! " Cap said virtuously . " They 'd ' a ' given you county money ! " " I doubt it , " Nason said . " They seemed good men : as good as you 'd at to meet . We had to swim across a couple of rivers ; they could n't for sour grapes , but they had no complaints . They did n't even nop ! ain when we had to go two days without food . " " Why would they ? " Cap demanded . " Would I ' a ' complained if I 'd been in their boots ? Not by a damned sight ! The recollection of whatp26o happened to that General Gordon would have kept me awful polite a helpful . " " I sort of hated to leave ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Some of the things they claimed to know about America would a most make you die laughing . Whitcomb and I , we had considerabl trouble keeping our faces straight . " Cap looked politely interested . " I s'pose they think we got six toes o each foot , and all our womenfolks follow the army , and it 's a half hour ' walk from Maine over into Virginia , and it takes a whole afternoon t row around Rhode Island . " " Yes , just about , " Nason said . Then he added something that mad my flesh crawl . " They think nobody in America can build ships exec people from Maine . They told us they knew we 'd never be able build a fleet that amounted to anything , because we could n't g enough Maine men to build it . " At this Cap slapped his huge thighs and bellowed mirthfully ; and a the sound of his laughter everyone laughed with him  --  Tom Bickford Doc Means , Joseph Marie Verrieul , and Nason too . They drank from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tears ran do their cheeks ; but I , remembering the thoughtless extravagance of m speech to Ellen Phipps , dimly sweet on the doorstep of the farm hoes in Skenesboro in the dark of a hot July night , found nothing at which to laugh . My lips stiffened with horror at this final proof of all I had long feared and known , but had refused to face squarely , as is the way with most of us . Hopefully I had told myself that I might be wrong : that Nathaniel might not be in danger : that there might be two Marie de Sabrevoises . Now there could be no more such hopes . I heard again the words of idle bombasto with which , thinking to bring a smile to her lips , I had replied to Ellen 's question as to how lung it would take us to build the fleet . " If we can get enough men from Maine , " I had told her , " we 'll build it in a month . " And when she had scoffed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with more than a little truth , " They know how to build ships , and that 's more than can be said for a lot of the men they 're sending us . " And now here were these words , these idle , jesting words , incapable of being uttered by any American in sober truth , brought out of St. John 's by two Britishers , one of them a high officer , free to have access to the highest . I knew exactly what had happened . Ellen , having performed her aunt 's commission in Albany , had been taken by her brother back to St.p261John 's  --  back to Marie de Sabrevois . No doubt , in all innocence , she had  --  ( tried letters with her from the Loyalists that infested Albany , making hideous for Schuyler with the same sort of lying rumors that had  --  ' en spread about Arnold . Reunited with her aunt , whom she loved and listed , she must have told her all that had happened during her tray-s - how she had almost been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine could be obtained to build the fleet . Possiblyhad said she feared she might be forced to remain there forever , citing for men from Maine who would never come . And Marie de brevois had told the British ! In no other way could my words haveshed the officer captured by Whitcomb and Nason ! I was right : I had always been right . Marie de Sabrevois was a spy . e had used Nathaniel and Ellen to further her own ends ; and thus information had been given to the enemy through Ellen 's act and ( nigh Nathaniel's. 1 was thankful for the dim light in our small cabin  --  the faint yellow me of a single candle , that cast fantastic wavering shadows of my companions on the rough walls ; for otherwise they must have seen in my cc that I was afraid . And I was afraid ; afraid of what would happen to Nathaniel and to Ellen if this knowledge , strangely shared by me with woman from my own town  --  a woman who had once attempted to Ice a traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left us in a week , a low craft , long and raking . Her d red sides and her two big triangular sails , with yards that slanted ha . ward like twin quill pens held by invisible hands , gave her a foreign so that she seemed out of place amid the flaming foliage of these rig : northern headlands . She might have been a pirate from Algiers , steal into the north on some desperate adventure , except for the ragged h of her twelve long sweeps . So roughly did these scrabble her over t water that she looked more like a giant red bug , confused by her o ungainliness . Why Waterbury , Captain Thatcher and I did n't become stark , staring lunatics in the week after her departure , I ca n't say . Everything went wrong . The Gates galley had failed to join us , for every last s carpenter in Skenesboro had fallen a victim to the flux and intermittent fever . Our own efforts to outfit our vessels seemed merely laughable , f most of the things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found were n't the right ones . Gates himself came down the to show us a despatch from Arnold , who had taken post on the weste or inner side of Valcour Island . The galleys , he insisted to Gates , m be sent  --  they must be sent ! When we heard Arnold 's peremptory words , we knew we must ma shift with anything we could get . We seized whatever we could la hands on : shouted ourselves hoarse for rope and more rope : for rammen and hand-spikes : wads , priming-wires , tubes : worms , ladles , gun tae les : for cartridge paper , sponges , grape shot , round shot : for breechin hooks , cartridge boxes , musket and pistol cartridges : for powder an more powder : for rum , provisions , extra spars , seizing , spun yarn , wat kegs . On the 5th of October Wilkinson brought us word that Arnold could wait no longer : willy nilly we must sail as we were ; so we worked a that night with blazing pine-knots lashed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valcour . After the blinding sweat , the unending turmoil , the ceaseless labor of the past three months , the silent reaches of this narrow lake seemed a part of some new land  --  unreal , even , with the endless ragged wall ofp263arrow-clad mountains to the east , and the glaring colors with which the ores were painted  --  the bands of golden yellow , blazing orange , silvery ( ' ens and blues , patched here and there with furry browns that hadlook of huge animals sprawled asleep among the rolling hills . Splatrdon the browns and golds were gouts and smears of crimson and , as if a stricken giant had tramped , bleeding , high and low , huntthosewho had come with guns and swords and axes to put the curse war upon him . I wished with all my heart that it might prove unreal indeed  --  that - might cruise on and on , out of these constricted waters and into the m sea , away from the raggedness , hunger , disease , cruelty , tumult I death that must come crowding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valcour lies halfway between Ticonderoga and St. John 's , on the w York side of the lake ; and by noon on that peaceful October Sun-v we raised the high hogback of the island . It looked , from a distance , o a shaggy prehistoric buffalo , standing belly-deep off shore to feed . I ' or a time I thought there had been a mistake as to the whereabouts the fleet , even though Waterbury , a mile ahead of us in the Washing- , held his course due north , straight into the insignificant passage wren Valcour and the mainland . I saw no fleet in the passage , nor anywhere near it . Then I saw Waterbury haul his wind . At the same moment a puff white bloomed amid the reds , greens and yellows of the island . Anotherwhite ball blossomed , and another , and the heavy boom of great its struck against us . By looking hard I found a mast . Then , as if that had been a key to a puzzle , a whole grove of them was visible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared on , saluting the Washington . She slid in among the sts . As her sails came down , she , too , seemed almost to vanish . The men , hunkered beneath our low bulwarks for the warmth de-d diem by their torn and scanty garments , grumbled among themyes. 1 think Cap Huff spoke an almost universal thought when he from the mainmast look-out steps with a thud that shook the arterdeck , declaring violently that you might as well cooper a fleet in hogshead as hide it behind an island where nobody could see it . Tom Bickford had been exercising the men on the furling and lashing lateen sails . He hurried back to the quarterdeck , his face all smiles. sir , " Tom said , " that 's the smartest anchorage ever I saw ! How 'd m like to have to root them out , Cap'n Peter ? "  | Nason turned on him . " Look here ! If you have n't anything good say , do n't say it . " " That 's right ! " Cap bawled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you got anything to say , say it  --  unless it ai n't fitten to say , as Ste says . " Tom took the tiller from the helmsman . " I better take her in , Ca Peter , " he said . " We would n't want to make any kind of mess : not wit everybody there watching . " He turned a puzzled gaze on Cap Huff . " S calm ? When was I sarcastic ? I do n't aim to be sarcastic about anybody " No , I s'pose not ! " Cap Huff said . " I s'pose when you called that t smartest anchorage you ever saw , you just wanted to utter a Christi sentiment . " " What 's the matter with the anchorage ? " I asked . Cap eyed me doubtfully : then turned to peer into the channel tween Valcour and the main . By now we were in it , almost , running fast before the smart south wind . With each passing moment we so more clearly how the fleet was ranged . Midway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South of the shoulder is a cup-shaped bay ; and it was across the moil. of the bay that the fleet was stretched in half-moon formation . " The matter with it ? " Cap asked . " Why , look at it ! How would th get out of that corner , if they had to get out in a hurry ? Consideri the sailors they 've got aboard , they 'd be too busy bumping into ca other and running ashore to do anything else . Do you think they could ever run out and chase the British ? " He laughed hoarsely . " I would n't be at all surprised , " I said . " Those vessels have been cru ing for a month . It does n't take long to make a sailor , not if you 've g. seamen in charge . A man soon learns the ropes , when he knows ho ' going to get a rap with a belaying pin if he does n't . If that 's your on ! objection to the anchorage , stop worrying about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cap said coldly . " Ca n't 1 s. what it is ? Once you 're in there , you would n't know what was happe ing anywhere ! You might as well be up on the Chaudiere as behind that island ! " " Not quite , " I said . " Not quite . I hate to mention this in your hearing but it takes a seaman to understand ships , just as it takes a tailor to make a coat . You pay eight hundred dollars for a keg of rum because Congress printed money without knowing anything about money . They printed it the way they 'd print newspapers , and that 's why it 's worth no more than newspapers . " Cap breathed heavily . " Newspapers ! Money ! Eight hundred dollars ! What 's that got to do with this anchorage ? "  | " It 's got this to do with it . That anchorage was selected by a seaman.Lookat it carefully . A squadron coming down from the north ca n't even e this fleet , not unless a scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaws of the crescent . " " Ai n't that just what I say ? " Cap demanded . " Wait . You do n't understand . The British wo n't move against us they have a favorable wind  --  a wind from the north . Once they 've ) t it , they 'll keep all their vessels together , probably , and expect to pd us lying out in the open somewhere . They 'd never think of looking here for us , because from the north this channel looks like nothing all . " Cap was exasperated . " That 's what it looks like , and that 's what it Do n't you think I can see ? " " All right , " I told him . " If you can see so much , you can see what 's to happen when the British ships go past the island . " Cap 's eyes wavered . " When they go past ! Once they 're past , they 're at , and they do as they damned please , do n't they ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man or a gun of their main force until they 're safe from our fleet . If their ships should go on to Crown pint without finding us , we could sail to the Richelieu and blow theiry to pieces ; so they 've got to find us and try to put us out of the way . They 've got to . If they come down from the north , and run past this land , and then discover us after they 've got past , they 've got to come Lek again . They 've got to beat back against the wind , into this narrow channel ; and with the wind against ' em they 'll have a hell of a time it . The island 's so high that when they get into the channel , their mind 'll be all whichway , and they 'll have trouble maneuvering . Godws how many ships they 'll send against us ; but no matter how manye are , we 'll have a chance against ' em , thanks to whoever picked anchorage . " Cap put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intolerantly , " Who do you think picked it ? When you see a good anchorage like that  --  so good that right the first minute a person looks ft he do n't see the virtue in it , and only finds out it 's good after he it out himself and has second thoughts that show him it could n't n better , why , what you go to look for in the man that picked it is tins ! Arnold picked that anchorage ! But I would n't have told it on if it had n't been a good one . Whenever you see brains used around Its army , you 'll find they belong to just only about three or four men : ore likely three . One of ' em 's Arnold , and one of ' em 's Stevie Nason ! mold and Stevie Nason is two of ' em , anyhow . " We had hauled our wind and were headed straight for the curved line of vessels . We were so close we could see the tattered coats of the crews that swarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every vessel was a fringe of inverted evergreens , a collar of spruce or hemlock , so that the fleet had a holiday flavor . Our own men lay aloft in the ratlines and manned the rails , waving their disreputable caps , so that there must have been a lively look to us as we came slashing down into the little hay . All the vessels of the fleet , when they left Skenesboro , had been unriggedand at loose ends , unballasted and ungunned , just short of total wrecks . Now they were shipshape and handsome , their canvas neatly furled and the new striped flag of the United Colonies whipping out from every masthead . It was a miracle , this crescent of fourteen armed vessels , their black guns staring open-mouthed at us  --  this makeshift fleet manned by half-clad landsmen , whose white skins showed through the slits in their beggars ' rags , but who still could swing their arms at us and howl a hearty welcome . A ball of smoke popped from the side of the Royal Savage . A torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish in the roar of the guns that saluted us and the thunder of our own replies , only to burst on us again as the smoke clouds drifted backward to cling in wisps among the pines and birches . A boat slid out from under the counter of the Royal Savage . In the stern sheets sat a stocky , broad-shouldered figure , brightly uniformed , ' , . all blue and gold and buff . It was the general . He pointed to the center of the line , making a circling gesture . I looked at Tom . He nodded . " She 'll go as she is , " he said . We shot into the middle of the crescent , like a rabbit plunging into a hole . Close on one side was the Washington , her yards already lashed and her sails brailed up : on the other side a gundelo with a single 12-pounder in her bows , two 9-pounders amidships , and a newly broached keg of rum in her stern . We were so close that the gabble of the crews was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heel and laid her between the Washingtonand the Royal Savage . " What 's the anchorage ? " I asked the quarterdeck of the Royal Savage . " Six fathom and good bottom ! " they shouted . By the time General Arnold came aboard , our anchor was down , our sails were clewed up against our two raking yards , and we rode as neatly between our neighbors as though our snub noses were made fast to the same boom . Nason lined up the men for the general ; and , considering that some of them were Bounty Boys who , less than a month before , had beenp267ed the very sweepings of hell , they made a smart appearance  --  as rt as any body of men can make when their breeches are in shreds their coats no better. he general was all business when he climbed over the side . He came stop before Nason 's marines , pushed his under lip out and up , and ' Iced himself with feet far apart . It was always hard to guess what as thinking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at scarecrows , his thoughts were usually miles away . " Good ! " he told Nason . " We 'll make something out of these men ! re 's a barrel of rum in my boat . Have it brought aboard . " e turned abruptly and came aft . " So this is it ! " he said , looking Tor to me . " You did better than I thought you would . This is n't 1 vessel ! " he 's a good vessel , " I said . " She 'll sail rings around the Royal Sao-nold laughed . " To tell you the truth , the Royal Savage is about as as they come . In a breeze she bumps everything in sight , larboard , board , dead ahead or dead astern . I made up my mind when you a mile away . This is the vessel for me . " He looked aggressive , as expected a protest. ou 've made no mistake , " I said . " She can sail , and I think these have learned to sail her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do both . " anon had come to the quarterdeck with Cap Huff . Cap spoke up ly . " General , that 's the first thing I taught ' em . Either you can the British , ' I told ' em , or you 'll fight me ! ' That was enough for they 'll be wildcats for fighting , General , if ever you show ' em any to fight . " think I can show ' em some , " Arnold said . " I wish I could be as sure lowing ' em some decent coats and breeches. " x face was lumpy . " Damn ' em ! If they 'd only give me what I ask there 'd never be an Englishman get as far as Crown Point , nots he floated there dead ! Ask for a frigate and they give you a Ask for sailors and they give you tavern waiters ! Ask for a thou  --  pairs of breeches and they send you a dozen waistcoats . Ask for  --  lies and they call you a thief ! " n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll fool We 'll fool ' em yet ! Try to keep the men supplied with rum , so they freeze . I 've asked for clothes , but I ca n't get ' em . " General , " I asked , " have you heard for certain how many vessels the sh have built ? "  | He stared at me , pushing out that under lip . " Look here : I 'll mo into this vessel today . What sort of quarters are there ? " " Nothing to brag about , " I told him . " There 's one big room aft , f. officers . I did n't bulkhead it , in case we had to use it for a hospit We sleep on the floor ; but there 's a mess table , and you could sleep c that . " " That 's all right , " Arnold said . " I 'll go back , get my things , and move right over . " Zelph came aft , tenderly carrying a round-bellied kettle . " Lobscous Cap'n Peter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thickest to scouse I ever see . We eat now , guess we better . " " Lobscouse ! " Arnold cried . " What 's in it ? " " Gennle , " Zelph said , " they 's twict as much in this lobscouse as even I got into the same size lobscouse before . They 's some ducks and so pigs ' feet an ' a big snapper turkle , biggern your hat , Gennle , an ' a peck potatoes , an ' a mess ship braid all busted up . Yowl " " Do n't keep that lobscouse out here in this cold wind ! " the gener said sharply . " Get below with it ! " To me he added , " After all , I wo n't need my clothes and papers . They 're better off in the Royal Sava where there 's a cabin to stow ' em . Now I 'm here , I might as well stayI think we looked surprised at this decision ; for he laughed . " Co come ! Once the wind changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to lose a minute getting at that lobscouse ! " In the cabin , warmed by a plate of lobscouse and a tumbler of run the general told us some things that opened my eyes . I 'd known he w a better leader than any officer in our army ; but now it dawned on m that he was something more . He was a great man  --  a great captain in whom burned a flame of genius : a flame that fevered and provok the brains of small , mean men , filling them with envy and malice . ' 1'h is something I can not explain : all I can say is that those who admire him and recognized his worth were generous gentlemen  --  Washingto Schuyler , Joseph Warren , Silas Deane ; whereas those who hated hi with undying bitterness were human shrimps  --  Easton , Wilkinson , Wykoop , Hazen , Bedel and others of whom I shall speak in due toursWhen he had been talking to us and we to him for a time aft finishing the lobscouse , he put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I guess it is n't necessary to feed you any pap . You'v been through the mill , and do n't have to be babied . I think I can do yo the compliment of telling you the truth . " " Cap Huff looked concerned . " It ai n't nothing serious , is it , General ? We ai n't going to get our pay or nothing like that , are we ? " " Certainly not ! " Arnold said . " All available money had to be paidp269the militia and ship carpenters . You do n't think there 'd be anything t over for such as you , do you ? You 're supposed to fight : not to go mind whining for pay ! You ought to know it 's the loud talkers and e light workers that get paid for wars : not the fighters . " ' Tin glad to hear it , " Cap said . " If all these men got paid , and I had take their money off ' em the way I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army and look after my estate . " He took a package currency from his brown frock and whacked it against the table . It is about the size of two Bibles . " Good ! " Arnold said . " If that 's ship workers ' money , accept my congratulations for a patriotic act ! Only do n't let it interfere with your ties ! That 's one bad thing about money : if a man has much of it , it 's  --  t to make him too careful when he gets into a fight . I 'd hate to see yone too careful aboard this vessel when trouble starts , though I want . precautions overlooked ! We 're going to need ' em before we leave is anchorage ! " Tom Bickford had a word to say . " We spoke about it coming in , General  --  about the anchorage . It 's as if you 'd had it made ! Cap'n Peter s saying they 'd have a dreadful time beating in here after you ! " The general slapped his knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank d for that ! We 've got one or two sailors aboard this fleet , but damned seamen ! Damned few ! Yes sir ! This is one anchorage in a million ! ore grooves in this lake , running in and out of every cove and around Terry island , before I found it . It 's the only place on this part of the h where they 'll have to hunt for us , and then have their noses bitten before they  --  before they --  " " Then they 're stronger than we are , " I said . " How much --  " " I did n't say so ! " he interrupted . " Do n't misunderstand me ! " He shot quick glance at me . " As a matter of fact , they are stronger : a little roger : not much , probably . " He dismissed their possible superiority fh a wave of his hand . " The point is that their strength has almost bankrupted'em . They thought they were ready to sail a month ago ! If y could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The war would have been over  --  Pht ! Like that ! " Ile shook his fist at us . " But they could n't sail ! They could n't do it ! tanks to your work in Skenesboro , gentlemen , they had to go to buildagain . When I sailed up to Windmill Point and let ' em see my , they had to lay down three more vessels , starting a month ago ; v of ' em a --  " Ile interrupted himself , " If I could have got the shipwrights , if I have got the stores and the men , I 'd have built a frigate , as I270 RABBLE IN ARMSP270wanted to in the beginning ; and then , by God , let ' em try to find a hole in the north gate ! " " You do n't mean to say they 've built a frigate in a month ! A frigate ! Why , a frigate could knock all of us to pieces in half an hour ! " " There you go , " Arnold said , " getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigate , even if they have got one , or a dozen frigates , for that matter ! What we care about is delay . Delay ! Why , look here ! Today 's the sixth of October ! There 's snow on the Green Mountains ! It 's cold ! It 's nearly winter ; and the British are n't started yet ! Before you know it , there 'll be snow on the New York be beaten by snow and cold , and they know it ! A little more delay and we 've got ' ern ! They ca n't get through ! We 're safe for nearly a year ! Delay ! Delay ! That 's all we want . Every day we delay ' em now is worth a month 's delay earlier in the season ! " He jumped up and banged his fists on the table . " What 's more , there 's no price too high to pay for it ! No price ! " Tom Bickford 's hands were clenched . Cap Huff hitched at his belt , then rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed , stared into space . Arnold , I saw , could have whatever help they could give him in purchasing delay . Arnold saw it , too . He patted Cap 's shoulder and smiled at the rest of us . " I 've got to row around the fleet . Keep after ' em : that 's the only way ! Keep after things ! Maybe you noticed : there 's only one thing wrong with this anchorage . " " It looks all right to me , " I said . " Trees ! " Arnold complained . " Those trees behind us ! When the trouble comes , those trees might put us in a box ! If you climb one of ' em , as I did , you 'll find you can look right down on the deck of this vessel . That wo n't do ! We ca n't have that ! Carleton might take it into his head to land a few scouts on Valcour ; and before we knew it , they 'd be up the trees picking us off ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise . Cut young spruces and fasten ' em , butts up , around your ship , outside the bulwarks , so they make a six-foot palisade . They 'll give you shelter from musket fire , and they 'll be discouraging to anybody who tries to board you ! " He gave us a confident nod ; and before we could do him the courtesy of rising , he had run up the companion ladder , as spry as a cat . He stopped at the top and looked back at us , his dark face framed in the hatchway . " Waste no time ! Get yourself ready ! All they 're waiting for now is a north wind ! That may start to blow tonight . "  |p271Not  until after he had gone did we realize that although he had talked as freely and easily with us as though he held no higher rank than ours , and was just our hearty comrade , he had n't told us the one thing we all wished most to know . He had n't told us how much chance we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon us hum the north . P273THE wind was in the north the very next morning , but it was wea and soft : not glittering and knife-edged from northern snows . Our bulwarks were high with the butts of spruces , their branches trimmed o on the inner side . Over everything there was a soothing scent of green ery reminiscent of home and Christmas . Arnold had us knock together a plank table on the quarterdeck ; an , there he sat , writing letters , issuing orders and watching every vessel i the fleet  --  especially the Revenge , which was doing guard duty , runnin down the channel , and then beating up around the outside of the islan. all her men on deck , and gun-crews at their stations with lighted . matches . Whenever the Revenge sheered in to report , Arnold had a look hawk-nosed fierceness that put me in mind of an eagle . Those pale eyes of his were sharper than an eagle 's . He had th Trumbull moved , for fear the Royal Savage would swing against her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lee . He watche them exercising the guns on the Washington and sent word to the fir : lieutenant that the guns were laid too high . He saw a boatload of pe tatoes rowing out from the New York shore , and nothing would do bt he must examine all of them , to be sure we were getting proper valueHe was as busy as a hen who has hatched out a brood of ducks , hr calmer . With all his peering about and giving of orders , the wort flowed smoothly and rapidly from his pen . He called to me , shook the sand from a letter and handed it over . I was to General Schuyler , complaining of the manner in which the fle was treated . The Atlantic States his letter ran expect this fleet to protect the from the British , and evidently they think we can do it by shoutin " Kohl " and making faces . Where in God 's name is the powder we shoal have ? Where are the blankets ? My men are sleeping on bare decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockings and breeches ? M men are bare-legged and bare-footed . I could make warmer clothes It them out of a lace curtain ! We 're expected to fight , but given nothingP273fight with . . . . Is it possible my countrymen can be callous to their ongs , or hesitate one moment between slavery or death ? . . . I have ceived your letter about Major Brown 's charges against me , presented Colonel Easton . I am at a loss to know where these tales originated . ou know the falsity of them , and so do the Commissioners of Congress , t I will take it as a favor if you will continue to deny them at every portunity . Arnold tapped the page . " It 's this last I want you to see . Did you hear  --  y of these slanders in Skenesboro ? Did you hear I robbed the citizens Montreal of their belongings ? " " Yes sir , " I admitted . " Those stories were going around as far back as ly . " July ! They 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an overstatement , " I said . " Some damned fool starts a rumor , it nobody believes it  --  nobody with sense . " The look in Arnold 's eyes was worse than distressing . " I suppose , " he id , " you never had occasion to suspect the source of these rumors . " " Well , sir , I heard Brown and Easton mentioned , just as in your letter . " Arnold waved a contemptuous hand . " No , no ! I mean where Brown -t his crazy notions . Somebody supplied him with them . He never ought ' em up himself ! He 's dull  --  a thick-witted ass ! I know him ! He rut to Yale when I was in New Haven . Twenty-seven years old , he as , when he graduated from college  --  a noisy oaf , all muscle and no . rain ! A great man in college , because he could kick a football over r college buildings ; but he ca n't think for himself , and never could ! Indignant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston Harr ! He called it contrary to law and order , and above all a great waste tea . It was n't till he heard other people talk that he decided it was a triotic act . No , Brown never thought up those charges ! My God , man ! isten to them ! " i le snatched a paper from beneath a stone on his table . " Wants me rested for following crimes '  --  hm , hm ,  --  ' subjecting him to serve in an inferrior rank '  --  inferior rank ! The muddle-headed blunderer ! Listenirpermitting smallpox to spread before Quebec '  --  who does he think am ? God , able to stop smallpox from spreading ? He wants me tried r ' plundering the inhabitants of Montreal to the eternal disgrace of e Continental Army '  --  I suppose if he 'd been in command he 'd sat still d let his men starve  --  and here 's a gem : ' for giving unjustifiable , cruel d bloody orders , directing the inhabitants of whole villages to be put death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe , age or He looked purely exasperated . " That probably refers to the time I ordered De Haas to run the Indians out of Canasadauga for being a party to the murder of four prisoners at the Cedars : that must be what he means , the jackass ! " And here 's the climax : I was guilty of great misconduct from th camp at Cambridge until I was superseded by General Montgomery Pointe aux Trembles , near Quebec ! ' God knows what that mea Maybe somebody told him I was misconducting myself when I got m feet wet crossing the Height of Land , and had the indescribable car lessness to let myself get shot in the leg when we stormed Quebec " Those things do n't sound like Brown to me ! Somebody 's been fillingBrown with lies , up to the muzzle . They sound more like that Frenchman in Quebec who made us think Natanis was a spy , so we 'd shoot him instead of using him for a guide . We damned near did it too ! " " Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back beneath the stone and half rose to pee toward the upper end of Valcour  --  looking , evidently , for the Revenge " Oh , it 's not he ! He 's dead ! Clever , he was , too ; but he miscalculate Nason 's powers . Guerlac , his name was . Did n't Nason ever tell yo about Guerlac ? " I shook my head . " No , " Arnold said , " I suppose not . I suppose he would n't . There wa a woman in it  --  one he 'd never talk about . Well , it could n't be Guerla because Nason killed him . That 's who it sounds like , though . I 'd give good deal to find out what 's behind all this ! " He gnawed his thumb , his eyes focussed on something miles away . " These charges sound like the ravings of an idiot : they 're so preposter ous I ca n't dignify them by taking public notice of them , any mor than Gates or Schuyler can ; and the hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe anything about a man  --  anything If these reports ever reach Congress , there 'll be plenty to believe ' cm Plenty ! And God knows what they 'd do ! They might put that old gray mare Wynkoop back in command of this fleet . They might let a French man have it  --  a Frenchman who would n't have time to fight because o having to tell everybody what a fighter he was ! " " They 'd never do that ! " I protested . He looked at me pityingly . " Congress would n't ? Why would n't they ? Look at what they have done ! Have n't they just made St. Clair a general , for God 's sake ? And for what ? For what ? Damned if I know , unless it was because he voted to abandon Crown Point , or because his name sounded French to ' em ! The way to get quick promotion in thisp275v is to go to France and take a French name ; then Congress would Ike you a major general . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho considered himself superior to General Washington . " It 's no laughing matter , " Arnold said . " They do n't care who they protect , so long as he 's no damned good ! " I told him I was laughing because of Dr. Price 's book , which contended that people who have a parliament that subjects itself to any hug of foreign influence are n't free at all . " Price on Civil Liberty ? " Arnold asked eagerly . " Have you got that I 've heard of it , and I 'd like to look at it . That 's the book supposedto be responsible for the signing of the Declaration of Independ-ence ! " When I produced my copy , he read a few words : then clapped it shut . " Of course ! Of course ! He 's absolutely right ! This government of Hors is n't a government at all ! " I Ic tucked it in his sash and got to his feet to study the sky . " South ! " h  --  exclaimed . " No British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wee around the island ! The prize 'll be a keg of rum ! I 'll pay for it Hot of my own pocket ! We 'll show Waterbury a thing or two ! " He rubbed his hands together , balanced on his toes as if bursting withergy . " I 'll sail this hooker , and we 'll drink the rum ourselves ! " . The next day was the 8th , and the wind was in the south again ; id there it stayed on the 9th and the loth  --  a gusty , moist wind outa heavy sky , moaning ominously in our top-hamper and sighing mournefully in our spruce-decked bulwarks . On the night of the loth the breeze fell . Arnold , stretched on our " hiss table , was wakeful and read Price 's book by the light of two candles . I was wakeful , too , so that I knew that we were in for a change of *rather . The wind was raw and smelled of snow , and it swung into the northeast just before dawn . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a blanket apiece . The mountains on the New York shore , on the morning of the 11th , loomed white against a pale blue sky . Down the channel between Valemirand the mainland rushed an endless procession of white-caps , all of them soiled-looking , as is the way of white-caps on fresh water . Arnold wanted his breakfast , and he wanted it in a hurry . " None of your humming-bird breakfasts , either , " he warned Zelph . " I 've got to hive something to stick to my ribs ! This feels like a busy day ! " Lansakesalive , Gennle , " Zelph said , " they ai n't nothin ' aboard thisvessel , only a pail of coffee an ' a nice slab o ' salt poke an ' that ship braid I cooked on shore yesdy . What you say , Gennle ; coffee an ' poker " Look , " Cap Huff said . " I saw you playing around with a twentypoundsalmon last night  --  a salmon the size of a shark . Where is itr " Salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salmon 's for supper . " " No it 's not ! " Arnold said . " It 's for breakfast . Make a quick chowder pork scraps , ship bread and potatoes . We 'll eat him now while we ' got a chance . " Zelph snorted . " Chance ! Chance ! That all we got , chance ! La around and lay around , not doing nothin ' : that all we do , Gennle ! " " You make that chowder ! " Arnold said . " Before you know it you have so much to do you wo n't even have time to say fish , ' let alo cook one ! " The general was right . We were finishing Zelph 's chowder when t whole fleet set up a tumultuous shouting , and we hurried on deck .. find every ship 's crew perched on the guns and in the ratlines , peen ' into the north . They were watching the Revenge , and from the mann in which she was tearing down to us , like a little old lady with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had news . Arnold took one look at her , then turned to Nason . " Run up a whi pennant , and while you 're doing it , pass the word to the Washington All captains aboard the Congress for a Council of War ! " Cap Huff let out a roar that turned every face aboard the Washingt in our direction . " Hey there ! Wake up ! Tell Cap'n Thatcher and General Waterbun they 're wanted for a Council of War ! " His voice , echoing from the cli of Valcour , frightened a fish-hawk from a towering pine and sent screaming into the north . " Send the word along ! Do n't be afraid holler ! " Arnold groaned . " That 's no way to speak to officers ! " he told C. , severely . " Holler ' ! Wake up ' ! Hey there ' ! " " General , " Cap said , " I ca n't keep military words straight in my hea but I 'll get those captains over here if it 's the last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let off a two-pounder with a thum came about in the gun 's white smoke , and dropped her jib . The captain shouted through a birch-bark trumpet : " They 've co around Cumberland Head ! The first one was a ship  --  a full-rigged shit 0 Arnold , astride our taffrail , raised despairing eyes to heaven . " A - you , you damned fool , " he growled , " you had to fire a gun ! Why did you put a match to your magazine , so they 'd be sure to see you ? " " A full-rigged ship , " the captain of the Revenge repeated , " and two schooners , maybe sixteen guns each ! " " Did they see you ? " Arnold shouted.  | " I guess not ! They did n't haul their wind ! " " Is that all you saw ? " Arnold called . " Three vessels ? " " That 's all I waited to see . One was a full-rigged ship ! " Arnold made a funnel of his hands . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the island . Understand ? Anchor where you can watch ' em . If they keep on going , let ' em go ! Understand ? " " I 'll let ' em go , " the captain said . " If they come about and start for you , " Arnold shouted , " fire a gun and make sail . Fire a gun and get back here with no loss of time . Understand ? When you 're seen , fire a gun , and beat back up the channel . Take your place in the line of battle . Understand ? The moment you see one of the enemy come about , fire a gun and get away ! " The voice of Captain Seaman came faintly to us against the wind  --  " Fire a gun  --  beat back --  " Arnold shook his fist at us . " Now , then ! Wet the blankets and doubleshotthe guns ! We 'll show these British there 's somebody in the world besides themselves ! "  |p277I  WATCHED the captains come over the side : David Hawley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington galley ; puckery-lipped Captain Warner of the Trumbull ; red-headed Captain Davis of the Lee ; General Waterbury , second to Arnold in command , gray and sober-looking , his left shoulder thrust forward , crab-like : ColonelWigglesworth , third in command , a stocky , sedate man with quick blue eyes that belied his sedateness and a nose so hooked that he had the look of an amused hawk . I knew him for a sea captain of ability , as , a sea captain had to be to sail one of Nathaniel Tracy 's ships . The others I knew by sight only : Captain Dickenson of the Enterprisesloop ; and the gundelo captains  --  Grant of the Connecticut , wearing a bearskin coat ; little Ulmer of the Spitfire ; Simonds of the Providence , pale and shivering with an attack of intermittent fever ; Reed of the New York , whose clothes , I suspected , were in worse shape than mine , since they were concealed beneath a linen overall ; Rice of the Philadelphia and Grimes of the New Jersey , captains who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; Sumner , of the Boston , a Bostonian with a thoughtful look frequently encoun tered in Bostonians , even when least thoughtful ,  --  good men , all ofd them , though some had never been beyond lobster soundings . With a full-rigged ship maneuvering against us , however , our sea faring knowledge would be of less account than our ability to keep ou heads above water . Our own vessel , like all the others , was a turmoil of preparation . Men ran among the guns ; casting them loose ; setting tubes , fuses , yammers , water buckets in place ; falling over the water buckets and each other . Cap Huff 's scarecrow marines were herded amidships , drawing the charges from their muskets and reloading . Cap himself lay full length on the deck , his head down the main hatch , watching the screening of the powder-magazine with wet blankets ; bawling directions in a voice that set the whole belly of the galley to booming . I followed my fellow-captains down the companion ladder . The cabin was dim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me thep279feel of standing within a drum that rumbled a hurried call to arms . " Come , come , gentlemen ! " Arnold said . " Find seats if you can ! " He , , at at the end of the mess table , gripping it as though to pick it up and I yang it on the floor out of pure exuberance . There was no doubting is cheerfulness . We found seats between the gun-carriages , or on them , or astride the guns themselves , as poverty-stricken in appearance as sardine fishermen . " Now then , " Arnold said , " you heard the Revenge : a full-rigged ship and two 16-gun schooners passed Cumberland Head . By now they 're abreast of us on the far side of the island . The rest of the fleet 's with ' em  --  no question of that ! It 's what I expected , gentlemen : what I figuredon ! They have n't observed proper precautions ! They 've over-rated themselves ! They have n't kept proper watch , and so they 're going by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done ? " There was some clearing of throats . " Quick ! " Arnold said . " They 're going by ! " Colonel Wigglesworth spoke up , which was proper , he being a young roan , if not the youngest ; and the youngest is entitled to speak first in a Council of War . " What 's your opinion , General ? " " You 'll have my opinion fast enough ! What 's yours ? " Wigglesworth coughed . " Pretty hard to beat this anchorage . We could fight ' em right here . " " If we do , " General Waterbury protested , " we 'll never get away if we 're outgunned ! They 've got a full-rigged ship , so I guess there 's no doubt they 're superior . A running fight , I say ! On the lake we 'll have u chance to haul out if we 're sinking . Why , we 're cornered , here . " " You want to fight ' em on a retreat ? " Arnold asked . Waterbury coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not save ally ? " The captains clamored among themselves . Their words were lost in the clattering and thudding on the deck above . Arnold stood up and thumped the table . The captains were silent . " A11 right ! " Arnold said . " That 's what some of you think ; and here 's what I think ! The object of this fleet is n't to save itself ! We 've got just one job  --  to keep the British from getting through to Ticonderoga and the Hudson on this campaign  --  to save the lake from them for this year . What happens to us does n't matter , as long as we keep them where they are ! If luck 's against us , which I trust under God it wo n't be , then we can talk of retreat , but not till then ! That 's my opinion ! " Let 's suppose , gentlemen , we abandon this anchorage and fight the British on a retreat . What have we got to do it with ?

" On the other hand , gentlemen , suppose we remain at this anchorage . The British go past us . The wind 's in the north . We 've got the weather gauge ! We can jump out at ' em , those that are fastest , chop up the slow ones and get back here to the anchorage ! " He banged a fist on the table . " Then let ' em come , by God !

Yes , and we can do it now ! Now ! Now ! " His voice rose until the air of the cabin seemed to shiver . He clenched his fist and shook it in our faces . " At this anchorage we can meet ' em with concerted fire ! I do n't care how strong they are ! I do n't give a damn how many officers , seamen and gunners they got from the St. Lawrence fleet !

If we ca n't , we 'll find a way of delaying ' em again  --  delaying ' em and delaying ' em , till we 've saved the lake ! " He dropped his head . His eyes were round and fierce . " I say fight ' em here and fight ' em now ! What have you got to say to that ? " Being New Englanders and sea captains , they had little to say . Most of them coughed dryly , waiting for others to do the talking . Colonel Wigglesworth slowly turned his sharp blue eyes and his hooked nose from captain to captain , like a watchful hawk . Then , to Arnold , he said : " It appears we 're all willing , General . " Waterbury rose from his bench and jerked his cap hard down over his ears . " That 's settled ! We 'll fight ' em here !

Then , gentlemen , a few of us ' 11 have to sail out and see what we can do . Unlesse do so , it may occur to the British to tack back to the northward and come down on us from the northern end of the channel . We don'tant that : so we 'll let ' em see us pop out and pop back again . Then , unless I 'm greatly mistaken , they 'll never think there 's any way of getting at us except to follow us in .

Good grief , Genal ! There ai n't time to think of any ! " He was nearer right than he knew . The words had scarcely left his ps when there was a distant thump ; a penetrating thud that fluttered r ' air in our crowded cabin . The British had sighted the Revenge and nne about in chase of her . We scrambled for the companion ladder . Arnold 's voice above us purred us on . " Hoist away ! Foresail and mainsail ! Haul aft the sheets ! ' lap on there and haul ! Clap on and haul ! "  |p281WE  WENT down in an echelon , our own vessel in the lead , hugging the Valcour shore ; the Washington a little behind us , nearer the center of the channel ; then the Trumbull and the Royal Savage , each farther to the rear and nearer the New York side . Because of the branches above their bulwarks , they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good ! " he said . " They look as i they could stand a power of pounding ! " He stood on tiptoe to peer at the point of the island . So far as I could tell , he was wholly unmoved at the prospect of going into battle . With me it was different , I am free to say . No gun had ever been fired at me with serious intent , and the prospect of having God knows how many fired at me before the day was over left me with a liquefied feel in my stomach . I was uneasy , too , because Nathaniel was in the Royal Savage instead of aboard our own vessel . I wanted him where I could watch him ; per . baps steady him if anything went wrong . To tell the truth , I felt that I had him to watch , I might be steadier myself . As we opened out the sweep of lake to the south , the men at tilt bow guns set up a sudden shout . In the same moment we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-rigged ship  --  a sloop-of-war  --  work back toward us on the larboard tack . When we cleared the sheltering shoulder of Valcour we saw two schooners , big ones , pointing toward us as if racing . They yawed as we came out and let off bow guns . I did n't even look to see where the shot went , for just then we passed entirely beyond the southern tip of the island , and the whole broad expanse of lake lay before us , swatting with craft of every size and shape , as a marsh pool swarms wit ) waterfowl when the moon is full in October . In a long line to the eastward , their shining sails half blending with the snowy whiteness of the distant mountain wall , a throng of gun boats were converging on us . They were gundelos , each with a singlo cannon in its bow ; but they were long guns and loomed up in that clear air , as big , almost , as the boats themselves.  |p283Towering  up above these smaller fry , like a goose among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , high-sailed , bristling with heavy guns . There was another large vessel : a sort of overgrown gundelo . We minted seven guns on her : great guns  --  more than twice as many as any of our gundelos carried . Behind this swarm of vessels moved a phalanx of bateaux and canoes , drifting slowly southward , waiting : biding their time . The canoes , even at that distance , looked monstrous . They had high bulging bows and sterns , and the paddlers were thick in them , like teeth in a jawbone . Vcrrieul , from his perch in the ratlines , shouted that they were Canots flu maitre  --  Master canoes . That meant Indians  --  hundreds of Indians . " Well , well ! " Arnold said . " So that 's what they were up to ! " He glanced over his shoulder at the other galleys : then stepped up on the bulwarks to have a clearer look at the armada of gunboats bearing down on us . We seemed to be the hub of a girdle of vessels ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gun-crews , at their stations , were understandably restless ; for the north wind howling in our top-hamper must have cut like knives ; and that rim of gunboats , their sails fang-like against the eastern shore , was n't soothing . They shuffled and shivered , these shoeless , red-nosed gun-crews . Their eyes and heads turned constantly from us to the onrushing Brit-Arnold made tapping motions with his forefinger and counted  --  " twelve , thirteen , sixteen , twenty , twenty-three , twenty-four --  " Twenty-four gunboats , I make it , " he said . " Maybe fifty bateaux with troops . Light infantry , probably . See what you get . " He took the tiller from me . Nason came aft . " Sir , the bow gun 's double-shafted . " Arnold nodded . " Try it once . Then take two gun-crews aft to the IQ shin guns . We 'll haul our wind and get the eighteen-pounders into flay as we go back to the anchorage . " He thrust out his lower lip . " They 've got a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many to run risks with . " Through our fringe of spruces I tried to count . One of the distant schooners yawed again , puffing out a cloud of white smoke . The shot struck off our starboard bow , a quarter mile away . It seemed to me too lose . I lost count , but contrived somehow to arrive at what I consideredfair estimate . " Twenty-two , I make it , " I told Arnold . The bow gun let off with a crash that almost brought us to a stop . " All right , " Arnold said . " Let 's turn . "  |p284Tom  Bickford ran forward , shouting orders . We hauled our crossed the bows of the Washington galley . She went off a little then rounded into our wake . The Trumbull and the Royal Savage ( H. the same , as pretty as a picture . In five minutes ' time the four of t were running back into the channel in the face of the sharp northeast wind , close hauled on the starboard tack . " Now then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try at those schooners . " We went into the cabin and set the cabin tiller in place . The schooners showed up bright through the cabin ports , like a sailor 's half-mod in a frame . Arnold rubbed his hands together cheerfully , and the gu crews , ranged around the two long eighteens , stared at him ope mouthed , as though they watched a figure in a play . He looked a little like that , too , with his hat cocked on one side , h handsome blue coat , half open over a long waistcoat of yellow fur , an breeches of buff deerskin . Arnold was always neat ; and being a ric man , with means to indulge his whims , he was always uniformed as soldier should be  --  but as few were , in our poor army . He was onethose persons who seem neat , no matter what they wear , and he too pride in his appearance . " If you 're going to lead troops , " he told me once , " you ought to to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he meant . In the fascinate stare of the two gun-crews there was something more than admiration for their confident , smiling commander . Like myself , they were su he 'd bring us safe through the coming battle . Arnold tinkered with the quoin beneath the breech of the larboar eighteen-pounder : threw his weight on the gun to raise the rnuzzlwrenchedat the carriage and said , " Off a little : off a little ! " I altered our course the merest whisker . Arnold nodded to the gun captain , who slapped his linstock again the breech . The cabin flooring jerked : the galley lurched : the gu roared and sent white smoke rolling and tumbling astern . Arnold ra to the other stern gun and struggled with the quoin . We heard a gun slam from the Washington : two thudded together from the Trumbull and the Royal Savage . Arnold peered through the port . " Missed ! " he said . He stooge , squinted , threw up his hand . The linstock slapped , and our heads ran with the crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned me on deck.A seaman in the main top hung over the edge to bawl , " Splinte under the schooner 's larboard cat-head ! " A voice far forward  --  the voice of Cap Huff , I would have sworn-P285outed " Rum ! " Another voice took it up , and another , until the whole orepart of the vessel was clamoring for rum . TI le galley stood up well to the cold north wind , slashing through the op with cheery chucklings . Far behind us the British schooner let off other gun . We saw the shot kick up a spout between the Royal Sav-e and the Trumbull . War , I thought , was n't so bad , after all . The Royal Savage seemed slow , but she was better built than our rough gals ; and I was glad Nathaniel could see a battle under such favorable circumstances . It could n't help , I felt , but give him a greater sense of loyalty to those for whom he fought . We were in the channel by now , close over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starboard tack , we could see the American et clearly , about a mile away . The wind seemed to jump from north to northeast : to eddy around . Our mainsail slapped against the mast , and the galley swayed . Arnold came beside me and felt the tiller . The men continued to shout +r rum . " I do n't like the feel of that wind , " I told Arnold . " It bounces off the Ifs . I think we ought to get the canvas off her when we 're in midchannel , and row the rest of the way . " " Do so ! " Arnold said . He stepped to the break in the deck and spoke a rasping , high-pitched voice . " We 're taking in sail . Then we 're row-g to our anchorage . All you 've got to do , to get that rum , is brail up  --  ose sails in a hurry and clap onto your sweeps ! " Under bare poles the galley moved steadily over the last half mile . c pursuing schooners had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were hidden from us . So , too , was the sloop-of-war . Except r the black smears around the mouths of the spongers and rammers , ho had rubbed their noses with powder-stained hands , and the salty ) wrier-smoke that clung in our throats , we might have been return-g from a pleasure cruise . The Washington and the Trumbull , following our example , furled eh- sails and crawled along behind us . The Royal Savage , having no rs , took in her square topsails , and continued to make short tacks mc ! cr her fore-and-aft sails . I was sure Hawley felt the same insecurity bout the wind that I had felt . That crescent-shaped line of vessels , absurdly enough , seemed like some to me , and I could n't get back to it fast enough . I thought of it a sort of shelter from the unknown . As we crawled slowly into place in the curving line of gundelos and schooners , the turmoil on our decks was deafening . To present our  --  roadside to the vessels in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a spring on our cable by making fast a line to the anchor , running it through a stern port so to haul ourselves around at right angles to the wind after the anchor should be let go ; also it was necessary to drop our boats over the side , out of the way of the enemy 's fire , and to move our heaviest guns to the gun-ports that pointed down channel . Since our seamen were still green hands , all this movement required more running , shouting and giving of orders than can be imagined . Yet Arnold seemed to find the uproar pleasing . He stood at the break of the deck , speaking mildly to those who came near him , telling them to take it easy : to take it easy . There was a confused shouting from the gundelos on the eastern side of the crescent . One of the tall black schooners that had pursued us had hove in sight at the far end of the channel . She let off three guns in quick succession at the Royal Savage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her near the Valcour shore . Arnold , watching her through our fringe of hemlock , shook his head . " Look at her ! Where in God 's name did Hawley learn to judge dis-tances ? " " She ought to make it on the next tack , " I said . " I hope so , " he said sourly . " All my papers are aboard her : all my accounts . My clothes , too . " As an afterthought he added , " She 'd better make it unless she wants an eighteen-pound ball in her tail ! " He beckoned to Cap Huff , who , now that the guns had been traversed , stood at the break in the deck , restlessly waiting permission to draw the promised rum . " One gill to each , " Arnold told him , " and mind you do n't help yourself too freely . " The Royal Savage came up into the wind . I tried to find Nathaniel on the quarterdeck , but could n't . The vessel made me nervous , hanging there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put your helm over ! Over ! Drop your anchor ! " " She missed stays , " Arnold said . " She 's gone . " I pulled hard with my stomach muscles , trying to help her around somehow . Her sails filled . She fell off and moved slowly to the eastward , close to the island . Then she stopped . Far away as we were , I could see her masts bend . She stood there , motionless : then canted over on her starboardside . , " She struck ! " I said foolishly . " She 's ashore ! " " That 's right , " Arnold agreed . In a thoughtful voice he added , " This is a hell of a time to lose one of your best vessels . " I muttered that it was the wind , and racked my brain for something I could do to help Nathaniel.  | " Wind be damned ! " Arnold said coldly . " It was rotten bad seaman-ship ! " Into our line of vision came one of the small British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck 's head . She bored up into the channel with the help of a lug sail and four long oars . Another slid from behind the , boulder of the island , beyond the stranded Royal Savage : then three in clump : then another and another . A boat put out from the stranded vessel , an anchor balanced across its bows ; so Hawley was sending an anchor astern , in the hope of warping her off . Nathaniel , I was sure , would be in command of the boat . The black schooner let off a gun . The shot landed close to the boat 's bows , sending a spout of water as high as the Royal Savage 's main truck . The boat capsized and the anchor disappeared . We could see men swimming back to the Royal Savage . Our marines , hunkered down in the shelter of the bulwarks , between the guns , scrambled cautiously to their feet to look . Cap Huff andii Steven Nason worked on one of the long eighteens , clewing it so that itbore on the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " No hurry ! You 'll have as many chances as you want before the day 's over : better ones than that ! " Beyond the black schooner the southern end of the channel was choked with gunboats , each with its single big gun . There must have been twenty-five of them . Of the ship there was no sign , nor of the other schooner , nor of the strange floating fort we had seen . Arnold limped up and down the quarterdeck , swinging his arms . " By George , " he said , his voice high-pitched and triumphant , " I believe the sloop-of-war fell so far to leeward she ca n't get in ! " The whole fleet lay in a frozen silence , as if struck with horror at the black schooner driving so implacably toward the Royal Savage . I knew the fleet was silent only because the captains waited for Arnold to commencefiring . By now it was impossible to fire , since the schooner was in hue with the Royal Savage ; and even had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own men . But the Royal Savage , canted though she was , could fire , and did Spurts of smoke jetted from her tilted side . The thud of the guns came slowly to us . Her guns were small , mostly four-pounders , and they sounded feeble , hopeless . There was something unreal and dreamlike about the scene . The tall black schooner came slowly into the wind , as if forced to do so by the guns of the Royal Savage . She fell off on the starboard tack  --  on a course that would take her across the front of our crescent and put her in a position to rake the helpless Royal Savage .   Arnold watched her come about : then limped from the quarterdeck and ran to the bow gun : a twelve-pounder . He stooped and sighted along it : pulled at it a little : then came back to the next gun and did the same . He laid all the guns of the broadside ; and to Nason , who stood by the sternmost gun , I heard him say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . Then keep on till you 're told to stop . " He had no more than spoken when the black schooner fired her broadsideat the Royal Savage . Smoke , trailing out behind her , gave her the look of a ghost-ship . Hawley had n't taken in his sails , probably thinking they might help him get clear of the land . We saw holes open in them . Her rigging flew apart , here and there , and a staysail came down on the run ; but one of her stern guns popped defiantly . It was sickening to see her chopped up . The very broadside whose smoke I still saw might , I knew , be the end of Nathaniel . Three of our guns let off together with a bellowing roar ; then all the guns of the crescent went into action . Confined , as we were , in a narrow strait , between cliffs and tall pines , the thunder of the guns was like a helmet of sound crushed down upon us . A thick fog of white smoke rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel , whirling and eddying , driven onward less by wind , it seemed , than by the stupendous roaring of the guns  --  a roaring that shook the planks beneath our feet . What the intention of the schooner might have been , I could n't tell . She may have thought to rake us all : then go about until her consort and the sloop-of-war could come to her assistance . Certainly she was passingacross our front with all sail set and no thought of stopping , when the treacherous wind turned against her . tiShe swerved surprisingly into the north  --  then into the northeast . As if 1 a blind crew had snatched her from the hands of those who sailed her , she came straight for the center of our crescent . Arnold jumped from the quarterdeck to join the men who pushed and milled about the **25;1699;TOOLONG . I would have gone too , except that Tom Bickfordand Verrieul had gone with Steven Nason to help lay the guns , leaving the quarterdeck empty of all officers but myself . I did what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four little swivels on our larboard taffrail . Amid the roaring of the cannon , the poppingof those swivels sounded like puppies yapping at thunderclaps . The schooner 's crew seemed impotent to bring her hack on her course . On both sides of her , and dead ahead , the water boiled and spouted , hurled upward by the hail of shot . Our cannon smoke d ift ' d down upon her , caught in her upper sails and blew along her deck . A gashP289opened in her mainsail , as if slashed by a vast knife ; her canvas flapped in the veering wind . She could have held no straighter course for the middle of our line if she had been drawn by a cable . Voices , shrill and piping amid the up-'oar , rose in exultation from our main deck . The swivel gunners tore at the ends of their cartridges with their teeth . The sweat ran down their faces , smearing the powder grains around their mouths into black daubs . I found myself tight-muscled and sweating with desire to see t hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covey of gunboats had come across the channel and opened all together on the Royal Savage . Their more distant bellowing joined with ours to make a diabolic din . I saw the Royal Savage 's fore-topsail lean : then crumple , swing down and hang motionless against her ratlines . Black dots fell to the water from the Royal Savage 's bowsprit . Her crew , or what was left of it , was abandoning her . My anxiety over Nathanielwas leavened by my overwhelming desire to see the end of the black schooner which still , miraculously , towered unharmed amid the shot-lashed waters . Arnold ran up the companionway . His buckskin breeches were sponge-smeared , his right eye circled by a powder smudge . " What 's she doing ? Anchoring ? " he asked . " We ca n't see for the smoke . " That was what she was doing , and when her anchor went over the side , it had a spring on it . A moment later her stern began to come in sight as the men clapped onto the spring and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get it , " Arnold said . He scratched his swarthy jaw and eyed the nearing gunboats . All of them , by now , had turned from the silent Natal Savage and were moving up , strange misshapen waterfowl , their long guns stretched forward like eager heads , bent on reaching their distressedmother , the black schooner . " What about the crew of the Royal Savage ? " I asked . " Their boat capsized . They had to go ashore . " " Yes , send our boat , " he said . " Send Bickford . No , I need Bickford to lay guns . We 've only got three men who can lay a gun properly . You 'd better send Verrieul . Tell him to take boats from the other galleys . Tell him to bring Hawley back here , and some of his men . Divide the others among the galleys . " He watched the black schooner swing slowly broadside to us , his swarthy cheeks vibrating from the unceasing explosions of our cannon . " We 'll need extra men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to the companionway . " Keep your eye on the dead and wounded . Get the dead overboard as fast as you can . The men don'tp290like ' em around . Oh , and take off their clothes before you put ' em ov the side . We 'll need ' em . " He ran back to the guns . Verrieul prowled up and down behind Cap Huff 's marines while Ca bawling his loudest , directed the activity of four sharpshooters , perched on the lookout steps of our stumpy masts . Ropes , encircling them a- the masts , made it possible for them to use both hands for loading a- firing . When I told Verrieul he was to lead the rescue party to the Boy Savage , he took affectionate leave of Cap . He must have thought I might never see Cap alive again . Verrieul picked out four seamen , and they ran aft to the boat , be over as if by the stupendous roaring of the guns . Above me I heard penetrating thump . I looked up . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked convulsively : then fell straight dow striking the deck with a crunching sound , and sprawled motionless , L limbs at odd angles , like a broken scarecrow . One of his arms was go at the shoulder , and from the raw socket gushed blood that tremble . with the trembling of the deck . It was Zelph . I stepped over the widening pool of blood , took him by the remaini arm and lifted him up . He opened his eyes , gasped for breath , an screamed . There was something unreal about the shrillness of t scream . It seemed impossible that it could have come from a pers. known to me . The Zelph with whom I had grown up was incapable making such a sound . He stopped , drew a shuddering , rasping breath , and screamed again Cap ran to me and got him by the feet . I took the front of his tattermoose-skinjacket , and we dragged him aft . We carried him into the dark cabin and put him on the table . gasped and screamed , gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that low-ceiled room , peeled back Zelph 's jacket to eye t ragged hole from which blood welled in dark jets . " For God 's sake , " I said , " tie him up ! " Doc , wiping his fingers on a piece of sacking , turned mournful cy upon me . " He 's gone . His chest 's caved in . There 's ribs in his lungs , a nothing to be done . Seeing you 're a friend of his , maybe you 'd like to help him get it over with . " " Get it over with ? Get it over with ? " " Every time he breathes , " Doc said , " he 'll scream . He 'll scream till n the blood 's out of him . He 'll scream a long time , maybe . You better I me help him . " " Help him ? Let you help him ? " " Yes , " Doc said . " With opium . Or a knife . A knife 's quicker . " We stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Doc said mildly . " The best and kindest . You go on deck , both of you . " Zelph screamed once more . The sound was horrible . Keeping tight hold of me , Cap turned me toward the stairs and pushed me on deck , into the thundering tumult that surged , like invisiblewaves , over the rim of spruce butts that ringed us . One of Cap 's marines , clutching his jawbone with a bloody hand , stumbled against us , moaning . " Here ! " Cap said . " What 's the matter ? " The marine removed his hand from his face to let us see a three-inch splinter protruding from his cheek . Cap 's comment was contemptuous . " What you going to the hospital for that for ? " " To have it took out , " the marine said angrily . " There 's only one way to take it out , " Cap said callously , " and that 's this ! " He seized the splinter and pulled . The marine squealed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinter . Keep it to show the folks at home . " He slapped the marine on the shoulder and pushed him toward the bow . " Go on ! Get to work , now ! Remember you ai n't allowed but one wound when you fight on fresh water ! " He turned to look at me . " You all right ? " We stared at each other . Behindus the cabin was like a tomb . P292THE black schooner was the Carleton , one of those transported in pieces from the St. Lawrence and put together again in St. John 's . The shipriggedsloop-of-war was the Inflexible , and the other schooner was the Maria , both brought to St. John 's in sections in the same way , and rebuiltthere . At moments when there were rifts in the clouds of smoke that jetted from a hundred cannon , we could see , at the far end of the channel , the Inflexible and the Maria riding at anchor like toy vessels , unable to beat up to us . There were seamen of distinction aboard those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of them equalled Arnold . In everything he did , Arnold outthought them and outplanned them , and it was n't his fault that he did n't , even with his inferior force , destroy them and get safe away . It was the fault of those Patriots on the seacoast , so busy building privateers that they had failed to give him the carpenters , seamen and supplies for which he had never ceased to ask . Arnold had said the British would not keep proper watch : would run past us ; and so they did . He said they could n't beat up to us in that narrow strait , and they did n't . He said that if they knew enough to sail around the island and come down on us from the north , they 'd be more likely to go aground on the shoals northwest of us ; but instead of sailing around the island , they lay anchored at the southern end of the channel , as if their brains had jellied . He said they 'd underrate us ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Pringle and Sir Guy Carleton . On the Inflexible was the Lieutenant Schanck of whom Steven Nason had told us : the one who invented the centerboard . In the Carleton schooner was Lieutenant Dacres , destined to command some of England 's greatestships , and Edward Pellew , who became Lord Exmouth , and destroyedAlgiers and commanded all of England 's squadrons . Yet all these splendid seamen from the grand British navy , and all the German artillerymen in the gunboats and all their twenty-four-pounders , which were bigger than any gun we had , were not sufficient to silence Arnold , or to overwhelm this ragged rabble at whose head he fought  --  those sweepings of hell who had been worthless on land but had , in less thanP293one short month , been pounded into usefulness by shipboard discipline . How it was that Dacres and Pellew and every other man aboard the Carleton schooner escaped being torn to fragments by the incessant batteringof our guns is more than I know . For an hour she lay there , broadsideto us and within easy gunshot , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her booms , shot away her running rigging , smashed her longboat , broke her gun-carriages , threw solid shot and grape shot against her until her black sides were scarred from stem to stern with yellow pock-marks . Up and down behind our guns went Arnold , a demon of energy . His face was smeared with powder smudges ; from his hat hung a strip of gold lace , ripped loose by a passing grape shot ; his shoulder was crusted with a smear of brown , the blood of a gunner shot through the throat as Arnold crouched beneath him to sight a gun . His biting voice , shrill and harsh , drove the gun-crews as though he lashed them with a whip . " Double-shot ! " he told them . " Double-shot ! Give her another ! We 've got her now ! Hurry it up !

" Whenever one of the three sternmost guns was loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun and Arnold ran to the carriage , sighting and wrenching ; giving the word to fire . As the linstock slammed clown and the gun jerked backward , Arnold was off again : up and down , making jabbing motions with his fist : urging the gun-crews on : urging them on . There was something about his violent determination that was catching . It was like a sort of flame , searing all those exposed to it . No longer were my nerves and muscles rigid with the expectation of death : I burned with an eagerness to see our shots go home against the black schooner . So hot was this desire that it parched my lips and tongue : singed my cheeks until they seemed half charred . I forgot , even , to watch the shore of the island for the boats that had gone to get Nathaniel and the rest of the crew of the Royal Savage ; for the black schooner was in trouble . Half her guns had ceased to fire , and she was listing  --  not much , but listing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the shouts and caperingsof their crews , that there was an advantage to be pressed . Their stupendous belchings became sharper and more hurried , or so I thought . We could see what had happened . The Carleton 's spring had been shot away , and because of it , she was swinging head to wind once more : swinging bow on , into a position where she could bring no gun to bear on us , and where we , for the same reason , could rake her with eve shot . The black schooner hung there , head on . " Sink her ! " the men shouted " Sink her ! " They cursed the schooner , as if she had been a disobedient dog . One of her jibs went up . It would not fill , but flapped and shivered i the northeast wind . An officer scrambled out on the bowsprit , seizes the stay and kicked at the jib to make it draw . He threw himself agains it , whipping at it with his body . The schooner hung there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist at the gun-crews , spurring them on : then turne , and came up the gangway to where I stood at the lee swivels . " Get m a bucket of water , " he said to one of the swivel gunners . To me Ii said in a strained , hoarse voice , " Let 's have some rum : rum all ' roun My God , I 'm dry ! " I sent Tom Bickford for the rum , and thought to myself that Arno. was a caution . Exertions , losses , disappointments , danger , death  --  noth ing seemed to disturb him . He looked at his shot-pierced hat , tore off th hanging piece of gold lace , winked at me , and dropped the hat to th deck while he pulled up his sleeves to rinse his blackened hands an face in the bucket of water the swivel gunner brought him . Flapping his hands to dry them , he stood on tiptoe to peer over th spruce butts at the black schooner . There was an oily glare to the wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it , and a pale su threw a silvery glitter in our eyes . From the position of the sun in th. south , the clay was only half gone . It seemed incredible that this cold be so , since the battle had only just begun . It occurred to me , then , tha the Revenge had warned us of the approach of the British fleet this ver morning ; and that warning now seemed something that had reached u long ago , in the dim past . The thought of Nathaniel came back to me with a sudden shock . I seemed ages since I had seen those small black figures moving ashore from the stranded Royal Savage . I climbed on the rail to look shoreward wondering what in God 's name could be keeping the boats that ha . gone for the castaways . I saw the splash of oars , then , close to the roebanks , and made out the boats , moving toward us at last . I turned to tell Arnold . Against the glare of that southern sun the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wind , still , unable to make sail . Around her the water foamed from the skittering of grape shot , or spouted up in liquid plumes at the impact of solid shot . On her bow.  |p295s|pit  the small black figure had ceased to struggle with the jib , and was eking its way to the tip of the jib-boom . " There 's a brave man , " Arnold said . " He ought to go far if he lives e minutes more . " The figure that stood so carelessly at the end of the jib-boom , with no apparent thought for the shot that howled around him , was , we later learned , Pellew . Two gunboats moved slowly towards the schooner 's laranrdbow ; and Pellew , clinging to the preventer stay , leaned far outaardto heave a rope to one of them . The boat crew snatched at it and pissed . Pellew drew it in , coiling it neatly , and threw it out once more . he boats turned and rowed off , dragging the Carleton 's head around at ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schooner crept from line of battle , listed over like a man who leans heavily to ease his rts . Arnold shook his head . " No use ; no use ! We ca n't sink her : not with pop-guns . She 's got some dead aboard , though ; and she 's out of e fight . That 's something . That 's something ! Now we can tend to those shoats . " Torn Bickford brought the bucket of rum and water and set it at the eak in the deck . The men crowded up to it , unhooking tin cups from it belts or drawing them from hidden corners of their garments . They re a motley company , in their tattered travesties of clothes . Splinters d gashed them , and the blood was caked brown on the untended atches . Some wore dirty , blood-stained rags around their heads : Hind arms and legs . Their faces were smeared with black : streaked th sweat and with the tears that powder-smoke had brought . Tom handed up a cupful . Arnold took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , smacked his lips and exhaled ecstatically . Arnold gave them a tight-lipped grin . " You fought well ! " he said . done well ! You 've outfought a British fleet ! There 's nobody that n say more ! See you keep it up ! " He drank his second drink . One of the ragged seamen shouted , " You done well your own self , Ginrall !  --  Cap Huff herded a handful of his marines to the rear of the tattered alp . " What was it he said ? " he bawled . " Hey , General , tell these fellers mine ! They got to be encouraged ! " Arnold laughed . " They do n't need it ! All they need is something to not at ! " ' 1'lie ragged group cackled and drank their rum . Their eyes glittered d were restless . They scrambled back to the guns , whose explosions , w that the Carleton had escaped , seemed labored ; more disgruntled.  |p296I  turned to look shoreward again . The boats which carried the Royal Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galley : the other holding a course that would bring her under our counter . The boatmen were rowing raggedly . Their heads were turned , not toward us , but astern ; toward the rocky , pine-clad shores from which they had come . Something , I knew , had threatened them . I called to Tom Bickford to man the shoreward guns . Arnold came to stand beside me , scanning the dense growth of spruces that rose like massed spears above the brown rocks . From halfway up a tall spruce a jet of smoke puffed out , turned a pale blue and vanished . Our shoreward bow gun let off with a bellowingcough . As if the gun had released a spring on shore , a dusky , reddish figure popped out from behind a tree . Near him appeared another : then two more . They seemed enormous ; too large , almost , for men , and the color of animals : of sleek young bucks . They capered and made gestures , and suddenly were gone , like demons dissolving into thin air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a lynx , squalling in the night from hunger or frustrated love . Arnold spat over the side and eyed me slyly . " I was afraid those hellionswould n't show themselves . " " Afraid ? " I asked . " Afraid ? " " Listen ! " he said . We listened , and again we heard those distant quavering howls : howls whose shrillness seemed to set insects crawling behind my ears . He jerked his head toward the sound . " Nobody 'll ever leave this fight of his own free will , not while those gentlemen are co-hooping and cohoppingaround on shore ! " He was still in a good humor when Captain Hawley , followed by Nathaniel and a dozen members of the crew of the Royal Savage , clamberedover the side and came aft to report . They were draggled and dirty , but unwounded . Not wishing to make an exhibition of myself or embarrass Nathaniel , I said nothing to him : merely eyed him severely when he winked at me , looking mightily pleased with himself . Arnold sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a hard eye on Hawley . " Well , you were n't much help to us . " Hawley shook his head . Being behind him , I could see his hands were locked together , and his thumbs digging at his palms . He felt badly : no doubt of that . " Why did n't you come about sooner ? " Arnold demanded . Hawley only nodded . I could see his throat muscles work . Arnold 's swarthy face was puffy , as if he was near exploding.  |p297Nathaniel  spoke up . " We 'd have gone ashore , even if we 'd been anchored . I never saw anything to beat her crankiness . " Arnold turned to him almost deferentially . " I suppose you did n't , by any chance , save my papers ? " Nathaniel looked horrified . " Your papers ! Were your papers aboard ? " " Every document that bore on this campaign , " Arnold said gently . ' AIl my accounts : that 's all . " Hawley cleared his throat and drew a long breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British --  " He cleared his throat once more , stared t the sky and tried again . " They had me in Halifax , General . I was n l anxious to fight ' em . Real anxious to fight . " 1 le stopped . I felt sorry for him . Arnold shook his head and turned way . " We figured on taking her again , " Nathaniel broke in . " We figured  --  n swimming out to her . We would have , too , only when we started ek , we found those red skunks had cut us off  --  hundreds of ' ern ! Thebiggest men I ever saw ! " Hawley fumbled at the back of his neck . His eyes were fixed on his  --  t , and his voice was indistinct . " I 'll board her now if I can get enough  --  as . I 'll get your papers for you . " Arnold jerked his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the oval Savage . From her canted side slow jets of smoke puffed toward hung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south ragged streamers . " See that ? " Arnold demanded . " They boarded her , and now they 're filling our men with our own guns ! " He seemed to fly into a fury . " By God , if I have to abandon a vessel , I see to it that nobody else gets her ! " e shook his fist at Hawley and Nathaniel . " Why did n't you set her ' re ! Why did n't you blow her up ? What in God 's name was the usemaking the British a present of a schooner and guns and powder id shot ! " Ile ran to the companionway . Steven Nason straightened up from the aftermost gun , his face a black mask except for his eyelids , which were till white . " Lay your guns on the Royal Savage , " Arnold shouted . " Iant every gun in this fleet laid on that vessel ! Send word along the tie ! They ca n't have her ! Blow hell out of her ! " All along the deck the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , to let them bear more easily. 1 u his eagerness to have the Royal Savage destroyed , Arnold seemed have forgotten Hawley and Nathaniel . On the side of the British line closest to Valcour , one of the British gunboats was in trouble . The men aboard her were scurrying like tor- tared ants . A puff of smoke rose from her stern , and two men fell ova board . She surged slowly and distressingly . A dark mass of smoke rose u from her , and riding on the smoke was a powder chest . The smo . glowed and burned at the base , and spread enormously , as if press . flat by the chest on its crest . It enveloped the boat . The chest pole sideways into the air , turned end over end , and fell into the lake . Wit the crash of the explosion came a tumult of shouting from our own an the British boats . The smoke rolled away from the gunboat , and we saw that not on had her magazine exploded , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved toward her , and she toward the One of her men , in the water , made clutching motions with his ban . and vanished . When I turned my eye shoreward for a moment , to watch for India I saw that Hawley stood alone , feeling his neck and staring up at t sky , as if the cannon that pounded on all sides of us were to be fou somewhere in the heavens . I went to him , suspecting that he was , in way , in greater distress than the British gunboat . At the touch of my hand on his arm he drew away , walked past and spoke to Nathaniel . " I got to take back the Royal Savage , " he s ' flatly . " If I can get the men , I 'll take her ! Will you go to take her ? " Nathaniel looked from Hawley to me . " You 'd better go , " I told h .. " You 'll be safer in a small boat than you 'd be right here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hemlo. screen on our taffrail , counting the shot-holes in our hull . When pulled his head back , he seemed to have forgotten he had ever spoken . sharply to Hawley . " Mark the holes , " he said , tapping Hawley on t chest . " Get ' em marked right away , and in an hour you can take yo men over the side and put on some patches . " " Sir , " Hawley said , " lend me three bateaux and I 'll take the Savag I 'll get my men off the other vessels and take her back . " Arnold eyed the western hills dubiously . A wall of dirty gray cloud had pushed up above them , and the sun had gone down into that dar ling shroud . The color of the lake had changed to that of the slates which we wrote in school ; and in the gathering gloom the puffs of smo  --  that jetted from our own guns and those of the British were shot with pinkish orange glare . The spruces on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black barrier behind us : a threatenin saw-toothed harrier . " No , " Arnold said . By the time you 've rounded up your attackers , P299it 'll be night , and I 'll need you right here . We 've all got work to do  --  less we want our bones to rest permanently at Valcour . " Hawley clasped his hands behind him . I marveled at the length of his s . His stubby fingers , twisting together , seemed to reach nearly to knees . " I would n't choose to have the charge of  --  the charge of cowstandagainst me . " ' Nobody 's accusing you of cowardice ! " Arnold said quickly . " If it 'll make you feel any better , take two boats and half a dozen active men try to get through her cabin windows just at dark . " P305WEN darkness came at last , we had fought for five everlasting hours . The Royal Savage was in flames , set by the British when they saw Hawley 's and Nathaniel 's boats approaching . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelter of the ship and the schooners , which lay at the entrance of the channel , watching our shot-torn crescent like three cats sniffing a basket of sardines . The ship , her view of us at last unobstructed by her own gunboats , fired five broadsides before night shut down . The solid shot screamed above us ; a few , almost spent , thudded against a hull with the sound of a gigantic horse kicking a cavernous barn . Such , however , was her distancethat we made no answer , but lay there licking the wounds we could see and hunting for the others whose existence we suspected . Notwithstanding our plight , there was something cheerful about thdarknessand its myriad of small sounds , after the uproar of the day . Nine wounded men were stretched aft of the main hatch , with a staysailover them . Three had lost legs  --  one close to the thigh ; and one was shot through the stomach , but he was out of his head and obsessed with the belief that he was building stone walls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had taken anything more nourishing than rum and water since the night before , and probably would receive nothing but water and rum for some time , they would all recover . Seven dead men had been thrown into the water and were already as good as forgotten , and the blood and litter had been swabbed from the decks . A score of seamen were over the side in bateaux , nailing lead over shot-holes by the light of the column of fire that whirled upward from the Royal Savage . We had twelve shot-holes , some big enough to put your head through ; and to get at two of them it was necessary to tilt the galley by traversing the guns . Cap Huff , red and noisy from rum , superintended the cleaningof the fore part of the vessel while Nason worked a crew on the pumps . Cap kept his men in a good humor by telling them how he planned to go ashore as soon as he had time and catch an Indian and roast him for supper .

The sound was like the squalling of distant seagulls. mold had called a Council of War , and he waited for it in the Iu , scratching away at a letter by the light of a smoky lantern . The in had been swabbed down after Doe 's labors , but it reeked of blood saltpetre  --  an odor that would cling to it for many a day. mold 's curly black hair was draggled , and his pale eyes sunken , lie was tilted forward on the edge of his bench , driving his quill . s the paper as though freshly risen from a nap . There were timeslie seemed to me to be made of steel , wire and teak , rather than and blood. veil when a blinding flash of light left the outlines of the stern win-s seared blue against my eyeballs , Arnold 's pen scratched on with-u break . " There she goes ! " he said . The flash was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It echoed from the cliffs alcour and from the New York shore , rolling from shore to island  --  back again in swelling waves of sound ; and through all its booming reverberating Arnold kept right on with his writing . Ic captains who had that morning assembled in our small cabin had an odd-looking lot ; but they were even odder now , as they came filing down the companion . Waterbury had hurt his back , so thatwas humped over like an old , old man , supporting himself on the Ile of a gun-swab . Burning powder had fallen on his coat , covering Ith neat round spots , not unlike the dapplings of a young fawn. lesworth , hook-nosed and sedate , had washed the powder from his but done it over-hastily , so that his nostrils were black , still , as as his ears and his neck , and the inner corners of his eyes , which him the staring look of a startled owl .

Since the Enterprise had been the right of our line , she had been close to shore , and those aboard bad seen more than they wished of the Indians.  --  y Jody , " Dickenson said , wagging his coat tail at us , " they lookedt feet tall , and they had black faces ! If I had n't known they were , I 'd have said they 'd been spewed up from the bottomless pit ! " v ( 1-headed Captain Davis of the Lee galley had a bandage around head : a bandage so caked with blood that his hair seemed pale beside it . Simonds , who had been white and shivering with ague wh we last saw him , was burning with fever now , and perpetually de ing his throat and muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit. out of his senses . Captain Rice might have been drunk , so thick was his speech : eyes were glassy ; and only the repeated nudgings of his friend Grii kept him awake . Evidently he had been badly shocked . Grimes smeared with blood from neck to knee , doubtless from helping wounded man . Little Ulmer of the Spitfire wore a bandage on his thigh . Sumner of the Boston had been deafened by the close passage of cannon ball , which had broken his ear-drums . Thatcher of the Wa. ington , Warner of the Trumbull , Reed of the New York and Grant the Connecticut were not to be seen . Arnold spoke impatiently . " We 'll wait no longer . I wanted to ma public acknowledgment to all of you together , but under the circumstances the missing ones will understand how it is . Gentlemen , y. fought well ! I 'm proud of what you 've done this day . I hope your co try 'll have the sense to be grateful ! " An epidemic of throat-clearing broke out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough boards on which they " Now , then , " Arnold said , " we 've lost the Philadelphia . Captain R tells me she sank half an hour ago . And we 've been so unfortunate as lose the Royal Savage "  --  he glanced quickly at Hawley 's rigid face -- spite of Captain Hawley 's effort to retake her . A brave effort , Capt Hawley : a brave effort against heavy odds . " Hawley made a strangled noise in his throat and cast a pitiful glance at Wigglesworth , who sat beside him . Wigglesworth nodded sober and said , " Good work . " " From the appearance of things , " Arnold said , " they were a lift more lavish in their attentions to General Waterbury and this yes . than to some of the others ; but none of us were overlooked , I suspect He hesitated . " Captain Reed of the New York sends me word thathis officers were killed , and Captain Warner and Captain Grant ha a few splinters in them , but the rest of us did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , General ? " Waterbury tried to straighten up . The effort made him groan . " 13 ' Captain Thatcher 's seriously wounded and the sailing master , too . first lieutenant and three others are killed . I 've got a twelve-pound. through my mainmast and God knows how many through the hull . sails are shot to pieces , so far as I can see . " Arnold disposed of Waterbury 's troubles . " I 'll give you Captain Ha ley . He 'll get sail on her if she 's got a rag to set . "  |p303Hawley  laughed abruptly . " I guess we can get some on her some-'w . Arnold nodded . " Yes , that 's right ! Get some on her , even if you have use the men 's breeches for sails , because we 're going to move . " Feet clattered on the companionway , and Tom Bickford 's face app'ared . " Fog ! " he said . " It 's drifted so thick we ca n't see the Indian es on the island . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold cried . " Just what we need ! I take it there 's me of you anxious to stay where we are ! " He opened his mouth in a de and silent laugh . General Waterbury spoke sourly . " If we can go , we 'd better . I do n't believe there 's a vessel in the fleet with fifty rounds left . I do n't believe could fight two hours more  --  if it was the kind of fighting we did to-Arnold 's eyes , in that dark cabin , seemed to absorb most of the light in our tin lantern . " Look at that , now ! Everything 's turning out just it should ! We 've got a northerly breeze still , a fog to hide in , and ere 's no moon till tomorrow . What 's more , none of us want to stay , and the British think they 've got us bottled up ! " Ile laughed again , that silent , open-mouthed laugh : then abruptly  --  came grim . " So we 'll get away ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em one y : we 've got to delay ' em some more !

We 'll do it , because they 'll never Beet us to do it ! " Ile banged his fist on the table . " By God , gentlemen , I 'd like to see the ' es of those British captains when they wake up tomorrow and find it noses stuck in an empty fox-hole ! " The captains chuckled . In a few short sentences Arnold had banished I their doubts and filled them with confidence and eagerness to be me . Ile took a paper from the table . " Listen to this , now , and for God 's ke make no mistakes . I want every captain to take the helm of his ii vessel , and I want each one of you to put his best officer in the nv with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through that British fleet without a sound : understand ?

We 're gone ! Our goose is cooked ! Understand ? " Nobody said anything .   " All right , then , " Arnold said . " I want each of you to put six stou men on your starboard bow with six spare oars . That 's to fend you o if you start to run ashore . Tell ' em to keep their mouths shut in case they have to do any fending , unless they want their gizzards blown out .

If he moves his lantern up and dow go straight ahead : if he circles it to larboard , steer to larboard : if t starboard , go to starboard . That 's easy enough , is n't it ? " The captains agreed that it was . " You 'll want one more lantern in your stern , " Arnold told the " Screen it well , so it can only be seen from dead astern . Then all that ' necessary is for those with square sails to set ' em , along with your steer ing sails , run before the wind , and follow the lantern . Those with latee rig need only the foresail . Understand ? " " Oars out or in ? " Hawley asked . " Be careful of your oars , " Arnold warned . " You 'll have to have ' e out , so to hold off in case you run up too close on the vessel in front o you ; but do n't use ' em till you must . And whatever you do , plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rattle if you need to us ' em . General Waterbury coughed dryly . " If they discover us --  " " General , " Arnold said , " I know the British pretty well . They don ' think much of us . They 're tired tonight  --  tired and battered ; and when Englishmen are tired and battered , they like to have a cup of tea or a quart of rum and go to sleep . Since they do n't think much of us , that 's just what they 're going to do , General . They 're going to sleep . I think we 'll go through them without the least trouble : without any trouble at all . " He stared around at us : then he , too , coughed . " If they should discover us , I know you 'll make it as expensive a discovery as possible . " He moved close to the lantern to read from the paper in his hand . " Here 's your sailing order . It 's the same order in which you now lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . Colonel Wiggles worth in the Trumbull will pass across your front at seven o'clock .

I sounded it myself . With this northeast breeze there 'll be waves on the rocks , and you can gauge your distance from them . " He read the order in which the gundelos and the schooners were to follow : then read it again , more slowly . " All clear ? " he asked . The captains muttered that everything was clear .   " Ile Washington and the Congress will bring up your rear , " Arnold d .

Arnold jumped to assist him , as spry as though weariness he were strangers. c laughed and winked at us , as he helped along his crippled second command . " A pleasant trip , gentlemen ! I trust we 'll meet soon at u Point . "
