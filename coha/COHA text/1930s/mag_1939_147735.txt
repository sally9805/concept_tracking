Nine years ago a band leader named Ben Pollack was drawing hot music 's purists to Chicago 's Southmoor Hotel . His band , a future who 's who of jazz , included a solemn , bespectacled clarinetist named Benny Goodman , a shockheaded , galvanic drummer named Gene Krupa , a rangy , adolescent trombonist with an Iowa accent named Alton Glenn Miller . As the years went by , and hot jazz built up from a provincial ripple to a national tidal wave , Clarinetist Goodman rode to shore on its crest and was crowned King of Swing . <P> For three years ( 1935-38 ) Clarinetist Goodman retained his crown . But by last spring a lusty group of pretenders was after it . Chief among them - was a youngster named Artie Shaw . Last March , while King Goodman and Pretender Shaw fought a battle of music in Newark , N. J. ( TIME , March 6 ) , a brand-new band was drawing some discriminating New Jersey jitterbugs to the Meadowbrook Club in neighboring Cedar Grove . Leading it was Ben Pollack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller 's was rated as just another good swing band . But last summer , when it moved to Westchester 's Glen Island Casino , things began to happen . Within five months Glenn Miller 's band was causing more rug-dust to fly , making more phonograph records , and playing more radio dates than Goodman and Shaw together . Last month the Chesterfield Hour conferred swing 's Pulitzer Prize on Miller by signing him up to take Paul Whiteman 's place , beginning Dec. 27 . Last week Trombonist Miller , now undisputed King of Swing , went back to play a week 's engagement , just for old times ' sake , at the Meadowbrook Club . <P> Glenn Miller attributes his crescendo to the " juke box . " which retails recorded music at 5 a shot in bars , restaurants and small roadside dance joints , and has become the record industry 's biggest customer ( TIME , Sept. 4 ) . Of the twelve to 24 discs in each of today 's 300,000 U. S. juke boxes , from two to six are usually Glenn Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little leery of his spotlighted throne . Says he : " I do n't want to be the king of swing or anything else . I 'd rather have a reputation as one of the best all-round bands . "
