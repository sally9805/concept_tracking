AS THE EARTH TURNS SPRING zorstuff with the feet of felt boots pulled over her shoes so that she scuffed when she walked . " Now ai n't t'is nice , " she demanded heartily . " Now t'is what I call nice . Seem t'at I ai n't seen no face but t'ese  --  , " she moved her free arm in a generous circle , "  --  for how long , I do n't know t'at . My , my . I guess you got big heart , great big heart . My , now I am please ; you come out t'is time of night for me , one you do n't know . You got ver ' big heart . " " Oh , we always give and take round here , " Jen said . " That 's how we manage . " She took the child capably and flung off a half dozen blankets from about his cheeks and neck . He had black eyes too ; Jen did not expect them in a baby and they seemed to pop out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same distortedmouth , hot face , and restless head of all the other croupy children she had known . " Yes , " she said . " Well , now , we 'll get right after this . It 's croup he 's got . " " Croup , is it ? " Mrs. Janowski asked respectfully . " My kids , t'e ot'er ones , t'ey not have t'at croup . " " It 's common in these parts , " Jen said . She laid the baby on the table and threw off her coat and cap , stilling him with one hand . " First thing , we 'll need this kettle full of boiling water . If you 've got other kettles , set them boiling , too . The more steam the better . Start up your fire good . And while we 're waiting for it , we 'll get some of this ipecac into him . " She shook the bottle . " It is n't a very nice job , " she said , " but it 's the onlyway , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . " Mrs. Janowski , back from putting on the kettle andstuffing wood into one of her stoves , stood with arms akimbo , her head on one side . " My , " she said agreeably . " I s'pose ! " And she continued to stand by , still agreeable , still helpless , while Jen dosed the child and made him lose his bit of supper and part of the phlegm that had caught in his throat , while wet hot towels were bound on his neck and chest , and while steam crept slowly through the big room . Jen was not surprised that she had no help ; not only Polish mothers stood aside to let her have her way with ailing babies . When the attack was over , she asked for clean , dry clothes and blankets , and dressed the little patient with as deft , sure movements as if his eyes , now growing sleepy , had been gray or blue . She was smiling as she held him out . " Now he 's coming , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him warm . He 'll be all right . If he ever has another spell , you do like this and he 'll come out of it . If you start soon enough , you may not need the ipecac , but it would be as well to keep some handy . When a young one goes to bed all right and wakes up hoarse and barking , you can be pretty certain it 's the croup . " " My , " exclaimed Mrs. Janowski , staring in admiration , only half listening . " Ai n't fat t'e great big heart you got . So good , I can not t'ank you . Sometime maybe you come in again , I fink so . " " Oh , yes , " Jen answered . " And you come over and see us . " It was the way she would have replied to any other neighbor . She put on her coat and cap and took up her kettle . " It 'll soon be good going now , and we womenfolks wo n't be kept so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his room , still in his corduroytrousers and high leather boots and plaid lumberjack , still with no hat . His shadow lay black across the path of lamplight . Jen had forgotten him . His comingreminded her of the children and she glanced about , seeing them all asleep in the beds that lined the wall . It was a wonder so much commotion had not roused even one of them . She supposed Mr. Janowski must sleep in the loft . After all , a barn was a strange place to live . " My Stan take you home okay , " Mrs. Janowski was saying , jogging the baby across her elbow . " You got t'e good heart . I ai n't forget . " " Take me home ! " Jen jeered . " There is n't a foot of the way between here and the house I do n't know like my own sinkroom . " " I 'll just go along , " Stan said . " It 's so muddy . " " He take you , " nodded his mother proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jen agreed . " Just as you say . " They went back through the fields and it was foggierthan when they came down . Jen had to lead the way , carrying the lantern , for she knew the lay of the land and could skirt the low spots . Stan 's step was deliberateand patient behind her . Once he said , " You do n't seem old enough to know so much what to do . " " Some people always know , " Jen said . " And other ones never do . " She had no thought of bragging , only speaking the truth , more to excuse herself . " Anyway , I 've brought up a big family . You learn things when you have to . " " That 's right , " Stan said . " That 's what I think . ISPRING 103do n't know much about farming , but I 'm learning . Now I have to . " " That 's it , " Jen answered . " It works out so . " She turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed her the kettle . For an instant the lantern lit up their faces , shining dimly between them . " If you get stuck , " Jen added , " maybe father can help you . He 's called a good farmer . " " I 'd say he was a fine one , " Stan told her . " It did a lot of good , your coming over . Mother did n't know much what to do . We sure appreciate it . " " You need steam to beat off croup , " Jen said . " And hot rags bound on wet . And ipecac if it 's bad . She 'll get the hang of it . It 's doubtful if it 'll come on again now until next winter , anyway . You folks go to bed and get some sleep . " She nodded cheerfully , went in , and shut the door . In her kitchen all was as she had left it . No one had awakened to wonder where she was . She hung up the coat and cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be washed . Minnie Foote 's clock on the shelf still awaited winding . Jen reached up and felt for the key where she kept it tucked under the paper . She turned it with long , slow movements , glancing about contentedly . This room felt good to her , returning . It always did , for it was hers ; with all that it held and all that it ever had held , it was hers . Even what she saw from the back window seemed a possession . She paused there , passing on her way to the stairs , having blown out the light . Always she saw the same woods and fields and sky ; always felt the same gust of cool air stealing in around the frame whenever she stopped to look out . She felt it now , and drew a short , I04 AS THE EARTH TURNSquick breath of satisfaction . This was something which she had and could keep , her kitchen and her back window . Softly she opened the stairway door , and softly crept up to undress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat atbreakfast before Mrs. Shaw and Bun were up . " John , you can drink more milk than that , " Jensaid . " You set still now and drink your milk . " " He 's in a hurry this morning , " Mark Shaw explained , glancing at John gravely . " What for ? What 's your hurry , John ? " " I got something , " John answered . " What ? " " Something out in the barn . " Jen studied him . Her face brightened slowly and she looked at her father . " The heifer 's come in ! " she said . " Got a heifer calf too , " Mark Shaw said . " A big one for a young cow . Marked just like its mother ; that streak down her back . " " Father give it to me , " said John . " It 's mine . I'mgoing to milk her when she grows up . Father says Ican . I guess she 'll give good milk . She 's a Jersey . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt she 'll be the bestmilker on the place . When did Polly come in , father ? " " Some time in the night . Late , likely . " " She 's all right then ? " " Seems smart . " Later in the morning Mark Shaw came out of theSPRING Io5shed pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with posts . The fence that divided the upper field from the pasture had to be built all new this year and because it crossed a high sandy stretch of land it could be done early . John ran ahead of his father to let down the bars , glancing back now and then anxiously toward the barn . It worriedhim to go so far from the calf , but he could not miss seeing the fence built ; it might be that he would even drive some of the staples for he was much bigger now than last spring and could feel a lump on his upper arm . " It do n't seem possible , " Jen thought , " it 's fencing time again . " A shout from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning away . Her father had put down the handles of the wheelbarrow and stood looking at the sky , his hat on the back of his head . John stood just so , too , his hands tucked inside the suspend , ers of his overalls . Jen saw the dark triangle they were watching and ran out into the yard . " My , ai n't they early ? " she cried . " You wo n't see much more cold weather now , " Mark Shaw said from the top of the hill . He stooped to his load . Jen twisted childishly from side to side within her apron , her fists stiffened against the seams of her pockets . It was a great day when the wild geese came back . No more winter ; no more frozen water , shovelling snow , frostbitten toes , blocked roads , snapping nails , croup , colds , or hot beach rocks in the beds . She could take off the blankets soon , and put on sheets ; they were much easier to wash . Wild geese brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the leaderio6 AS THE EARTH TURNSfollowed in perfect formation by ever-lengthening rows of his kind , and , after the last , spring blew along lightly like a blue train on a black gown , filling the sky . " Well , now I know what I 've got to do , " she said aloud . " I 've got to sow my seeds . " Bun and John had filled eight wooden boxes with sand days before . Jen brought them down from the shed chamber and put them on newspapers on the kitchen floor . She knelt among them and spread out small paper packages flowering with pictures of firm white heads of cabbage , of curly green leaf lettuce , of a smooth big tomato with skin as red as blood . The colors excited her , and the thought of how fresh , raw vegetables smell and feel , and the wild , woody taste of them . She tore off a corner of one envelope and sowed the contents in little rows she had made with her forefinger . The seeds were very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of the box when it was empty , to show what variety these plants would be . The Crisp-As-Ice lettuce was the best , she thought , but Ed liked the Boston Market ; it did grow ranker , but the leaves were not so tender . She worked intently , and when she had finished , lined all the sunny windows in the kitchen and shed-room with her boxes . Her finger nails were rimmed with black , her face smudged , as she stood looking down at them . " They 'll be ready to be set out towards the last of May , " she thought . " That 's full soon enough , the way cool nights hold on late years . They 'll get a good start . " She must sow her zinnias and pansies before longSPRING 107now , too , and repot her geraniums . Slips should be rooted for the box on the porch railing . After the wild geese came back , there was no time to waste . " Did you ever see the wild geese back as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in . " Not for years , " Mark Shaw said . As he wiped his hands on the roller towel he remembered another spring that they had come as early . The spring he built this house the wild geese went over almost as soon as he was able to break ground for his cellar . It brought an early season and a long hot summer , with a good second crop of hay and a big corn harvest . It did not cost him a cent to winter eight cattle and a P pair of horses that next winter . " Not for years , " he 1 said . " I never did , " said Jen . " It 's not common . " She put a dish of fried salt pork on the table , and potatoes in their skins , and steamed biscuit . There was not much in the house for a change , but in a few months now they would be having lettuce and peas and cucumbers . It did not seem long to wait . That night she knelt beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his stockings and undershirt , rumpled his head in her lap , and stood him on his feet naked and pink and shaking with laughter . She liked to make him laugh . " Look , father , " she cried . " Look how John 's shootingup ! See the muscles in his legs and arms . See how broad his shoulders are . Here 's a boy can load two bags of grain at a time before long , and throw an ox if an ox needs throwing . Here 's a boy for you . Look at that ! " Mark Shaw , bent to unlace his right shoe , spreadingIo8 AS THE EARTH TURNSthe toes of the other foot inside the brown stocking , looked out under his eyebrows at the small body lately grown so lean and hard . Yes , here was a boy for him , a fifth boy . One like this would not want to fly the sky nor bury his nose in books . One like this would not leave his riggings out to rust , nor talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would house himself and all he owned snug and watertight ; let horses draw his ploughs , hens hatch his eggs , and time divide his cream from his milk ; watch the seasons as they passed and know from each one what to expect of the next . A boy like this would listen , not too smart nor too impatient nor too proud to learn what his land could teach him as the earth turned slowly round the sun . " Stout hands , too , " Mark Shaw said approvingly . " And it takes stout hands to milk a Jersey clean . " IvFriday afternoon when Mark Shaw came from market he brought Ed and Margaret with him . Margaret sat in the middle on the edge of the seat like a little girl , and Ed drove the horse ; he had not held reins in his hands for more than a week . Mark Shaw took up as little room as possible , still a lion 's share , one leg dangling outside the wagon to leave space for the suitcases crowded in among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he carried vegetables to his customers . " Hello , there ! " cried Jen , running out , stove cloth in hand . " Hello , Margaret ! Did you have a good time ? Did you go to the theater ? Hello , Ed , you old nui-SPRING 109sance ! . . . How are you liking him anyway , Margaret ? Is he going to do ? " " Oh , he 's fine , " said Margaret , looking up at Ed as he dragged out their bags . Jen had never heard her speak so proudly before . " Do n't trust her , " Ed grinned . " She would n't dare say different . " They glanced about them with a kind of relief . Jen , sprinkled with flour as usual , Mark Shaw leading the horse away , the children hanging about eager but shy , the house , the barn , and the dip and lift of uneven ground reassured them . They had finished with the strange excitement of new clothes , weddings , and cities , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Margaret . " It 's apple dumpling , " Jen said . " Oh , is it for supper ? I love it . " " Of course it 's for supper . " Ed interfered from where he was attending to the small matter of John 's shyness with movements of his arms and prodding fingers . " Do n't you go spoiling my wife , " he said . " She 's got to make her own apple dumplings . " " Not to-night , I hope , " laughed Jen . " No , not to-night . Please , Ed ! " Margaret begged him . They looked at each other . Ed pulled her toward him , smiling across her shoulder at Jen . " What do you think ? Shall I let her off this time ? " " Oh , settle it between yourselves , " Jen exclaimed . She flounced away good-humoredly . " You big sillies ! " When she had gone , Ed kissed Margaret . He turnedher around until she could see the chimneys of theiriio AS THE EARTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whispered something , kissed her again , and took up the two suitcases in one hand so that the other would be free to hold one of hers as they went into the house . They seemed to have forgotten the children . " Well , is it settled ? " Jen asked with amusement , closing the oven door . The kitchen smelled of food as it always did , and of smoke and soapy water . The couch cover and pillowtops were stiff with starch . Mrs. Shaw came hurryingfrom upstairs , smoothing back her hair , wearing her best dark blue dress . The skin of her thin face seemed stretched with her smile . She enjoyed company in the house , and even Ed , always her favorite of Mark 's children , had become company now . " Well , you got back all right ! " She kissed Margaret self-consciously . " You must have had a lovely time up there . I 'm in hopes you 're going to stop to tell us all about it . " " Of course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the front room , Ed , and leave all your nice clothes where they wo n't get scented up . " When a Shaw first came home after being married , he always slept in the front room . Mark Shaw and Cora had , and George and Mil . Jen glanced after Ed curiously . She had to put her mind to getting used to him this new way , this older , better-natured , faintly triumphant way . It was good ; she liked it in a man ; but it was new in Ed . She hurried to bring out hog 's head cheese made from a winter butchering , to test her applesauce cake with a toothpick , to whip the cream and thicken the gravy and slice the meat and fry the carrots all at the same time . Mrs. Shaw brought outSPRING IIIher own silver and the blue glass dish from the sittingroomcupboard , trying them first one way and then another on the table . Bun scrubbed her face and John 's and brushed their hair , so unrelenting to the knots that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected . They must look neat and clean for Teacher ; that she was now Ed 's wife , too , concerned them little ; she was certainly Teacher . That night the Ed Shaws told what they had seen and done in Boston . Margaret described the churches , the Park Street , the Phillips Brooks , Tremont Temple ; she had never imagined so much stained glass , such great organs . Bunker Hill monument looked just like the pictures ; it was quite a climb to the top ; and it was strange to see the Old North Church and think of Paul Revere and his lanterns . Ed had been most interested in the water front , to watch the shipping , and in the Charles River Basin ; when people could make land out of water , they were doing something . You saw big crowds on Washington Street late in the afternoon ; folks were packed as thick as they could stand ; it was no wonder a man had to keep his biggest roll of money pinned inside his shirt . Trains went overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would cave in before long , have to , for the ground they stood on was nothing but a honeycomb . The Harvard Bridge was a fine bridge , though , over the Charles River ; white cement , handsome ; you could see it from the train . Margaret liked the college buildings over in Cambridge ; some of them had been standing a good while ; they had a collection of glass flowers , too , that you could hardly tell from real ; Mil would have liked them . II2 AS THE EARTH TURNSMark Shaw , in his chair by the back window , cleared his throat and said , " I never been up to Boston . " " You ought to go , father , " Margaret told him . She said the last word shyly . " You ought to plan to go up there some time . It is n't far as distances run now-adays . " It was as far as it had ever been to Mark Shaw . It was ninety miles . He shook his head , his arm lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he said . " I never was one for travelling around . " " You and I are old stick-in-the-muds , father , " laughed Jen . " Whatever comes or goes , you and I stay right where we started . " She rose to set back the singing teakettle and stopped by the couch where John lay asleep flat on his stomachwith his face buried in the pillow . She turned him over to see if he had suffocated , and he drew away from her , snuggling down again . " Stick-in-the-mud , " he mumbled unexpectedly . " Yes , you 're a stick-in-the-mud , too , " said Jen . " They ca n't even get you to go to the village unless father and Jen and the cows and the pigs and the hens will go . I never saw such a boy . Father , you take him along to bed now . It 's time we was all asleep . " " Well , now , I do n't know whenever I 've had such an interesting evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It ai n't often anybody comes in with as much to tell over . I could listen to it for a week . " " There , you see you 've got to stay a week anyway ! " Jen said , handing Ed a lamp , smiling at Margaret . Ed shook his head . SPRING 113'No , we 're going over in the morning . " " Well , come back nights " " No , we might as well get settled in . It 's well enough to be there handy . I 've got spring work to do . " " He 's going to take to-morrow and Sunday to help me get started in the house , " Margaret added . She lifted an eyebrow at him saucily . " He 's promised , and I wo n't let him off . " " Do n't you get fresh with me , young woman , " he told her . " Or I 'll put you into the field to work to pay me back . " He laid his free hand on her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed back her good-nights over his arm , and they went away together . Yes , Ed was married now . He had his own wife , his own house , his own spring work to do . He could not waste his time here , now that he was back from Boston . Mark Shaw lifted John off the couch , shook him gently , and led him upstairs . " Come , " he said . " You 've got to get to bed if you 're going to be up betimes . That calf of yours 'll need tending . " " She can stand up a long while now , " John mumbled , " and she 's only three days old . She 'll make an awful good cow . " " If she 's tended , " Mark Shaw insisted . " They need tending . " vThe sun rose farther toward the north and set farthertoward the south every day . Jen watched her cabbage , lettuce , and tomatoes , saw the first and sec-114 AS THE EARTH TURNSand leaves push up through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettuce crinkled , and the tomatojagged like a two-edged saw . When the fourth leaves came she mixed the richest soil she had with dressing from the stanchions and set out the little plants in other boxes , each plant two inches from the next . They had a brave look now . John tied a rope around the new calf 's head and led her , gangling , wondering-eyed , about the yard . " Hold up , " said John . " Hold up , Stripey ! " If she had had a white spot on her face he would have called her Star , but as she was , her name was Stripey ; she liked it well enough , and liked the feel of the soft grass under her feet . It made her want to prance , and John held her tightly , trying to be at once firm and gentle . Mark Shaw took a basket and went into the woods on a Sunday to get wild cherry bark . His knife slid under it carefully , swiftly ; he knew the way ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years before and laid in a stock every April since . The stout , bitter smell of it crept into the pores of his hands with the brown stains . Half-grown trees , now in new leaf , were all around him , with a small patch of threatening April sky overhead , and rough ground underneath for his feet to find their way by . " You got to learn the lay of the land , " he had told his boys . " You ca n't always depend on the sun to get you home . " He trod his unmarked path complacently , the basket on his arm , his head bent . White-blooming thoroughwort and pennyroyal from last fall hung , dry and brown , from the rafters of the open chamber . Jen would steep the three together in a kettle and set theSPRING 115tea away in two green bottles that had been his mother 's . The tonic had a bitter taste , but it was good for blood that got to running too thick in the spring ; it helped the liver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter stiffness out of joints . Most people nowadays had no time to search the woods and nobodyknew the herbs , which to use or where to find them , but went to drug stores , and likely paid a dollar for nothing half so good to clear the blood as thoroughwort . Mark Shaw could remember the time when the herbwoman in a town was busier than the doctor . " Thoroughwort for the blood , " old Miss Mindwell Holmes had told her neighbors , not stingy with what she knew . The Charles Shaws and the Abner Joys and the William Willys used to go together for wild cherry bark in the spring and made a picnic of it , but late years it seemed that only Mark Shaw went ; he never found a tree disturbed . All the woods had now was left for him , though they had as much as ever . It seemed a great waste . He settled his basket more snugly on his arm . " Hullo , Mark , " said Orrin Hale from his barn door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Shaw answered , pausing . " They ca n't make nothing that tones anybody up like cherry bark and thoroughwort and pennyroyal . Christina steep it for you , does she ? " " No , " Orrin said . " We do n't have it here . We used to . " " I would n't pass a spring without it , " said Mark Shaw doggedly . " It ai n't like that you buy in drug store bottles . You know what you 're getting . " He started on , but Mrs. Hale called to him fromi16 AS THE EARTH TURNSthe window where she sat rocking in her pink plaid gingham dress , out of respect for Sunday . " They did n't serenade Ed and his wife , did they ? " " No , " Mark Shaw answered . He looked at Orrin Hale , a gray , thin little man who used to play the fiddle at serenades and parties . " No , it takes more young fellows than we 've got now to get up a serenade . " He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know why , but he knew it was so . " A good thing , " said Mrs. Hale , " they did n't have a serenade . The works they used to have around a woman 's house was past all bearing . I never forgot the night twenty or more of them carried on here . " Mark Shaw remembered it too . He had been one of the twenty . " I hear Orrin and his mother 's boarder 's got spliced . We 'd better drop in there Saturday night and see what 's going on . " They brought their crosscutsaws and washboilers and guns and waited in the woods across the road until the Hale house went dark . They crept under these front windows here , sat on the door rock , climbed the apple tree , and began to make a thundering noise . Gus Larribee galloped round and round the house with a cowbell tied to his neck and the others whooped , " Orrin ! Orrin ! Your cow 's out ! " They climbed up over the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't you coming out ? Ai n't you coming out ? If you do n't come out and treat us right , we 'll be troublesome all night . " It had been fall , Mark Shaw remembered now , still and cold ; it almost seemed he could hear the voices . He shifted the basket of bark again . " I do n't know , " he said . " We did n't do no harm , did we , Orrin ? " SPRING 117 " God 's sakes , no , " answered Orrin cordially , as if his serenade had been only yesterday and some of his treat of cigars and candy still remained in the kitchen cupboard . Mark Shaw went on . As he climbed Old Joe 's hill a glittering trickle came running down the wheel track to meet him . He regarded it soberly , and its source when he reached it , a spring that bubbled out from under a rock and made a basin for itself in the reddish clay of the ditch . It was springy land all through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men laying a culvert between the road and the gate that led into their field . It was as well to have a culvert there and so keep out of the ditch mud in the rainy seasons , he , thought . Old Joe had tipped off loads of hay and wood here , time and again , for Old Joe was built a shiftless fellow , one that left all his problems to Providence and his wife . It was no way to get along , Old Joe 's . " Laying you a culvert , be you ? " he asked . The Janowskis looked up and straightened their backs . The old one was breathing hard and his little dark face looked pasty , but the young one grinned , pushing back his hat and wiping sweat with a muddy hand . " Trying to , " he said . " Been at it since early this morning . It 's quite a job when you 're not handy at it , but we ca n't haul through this ditch . " " No , " Mark Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The young one grinned again . " You lost your wind , pa ? " " I got wind , " the old one cried . " I ai n't got t'at118 AS THE EARTH TURNSgreat arms you got . I ai n't got fern big shoulders . I ai n't do t'is heavy work in my life , I do n't . " He looked at Mark Shaw fiercely . " I am tailor , one good tailor . T'is boy he bring me out here in t'is place . All he t'ink , farm , farm , farm . All he want , farm , farm , farm . I tell to you  --  " he took a blundering step . " You set your father on that rock there , " Mark Shaw told the young one . " He 's beat out . I 'll give you a lift on them planks . " " You do n't  --  " the young one began . " I 've laid a good many planks , " Mark Shaw said , " in my ' time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , when that was in place and nailed , of another . Together he and the young Janowski laid a firm , smooth culvert that would last , that would be saving horses ' backs twenty years from now ; they laid it slowly , silently , with care , while the old one leaned against a boulder , panting . When it was done , Mark Shaw took up his basket . " I 'm certainly much obliged to you , " the young one said . " It wo n't cost you much to put down a well anywherehere , when you 're ready , " Mark Shaw said . " It 's springy land all through . Early fall 's a good time to put down a well ; before fall rains set in . " He nodded and went into his own field . It was late enough in the year now so that grass was dry by midday . He would soon turn his ground , ploughing the hills this year for he expected rain , and sowing an acre or more of corn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the pasture before long ; May the tenth was the day . Mark Shaw walked briskly into his yard , his left arm bent across his back to grasp theSPRING 119elbow of the right which carried the basket of herbs . He liked to see a culvert where a culvert was needed , and the planks laid well. wOne afternoon Margaret hurried along the path through the meadows that cut off more than a half mile of the distance between her house and the school . She was later than usual about getting home for Bobby Carpenter had been kept after hours for his fractions ; his spelling , too . Poor Bobby seemed slower than ever now that he had two Janowskis in his class . Maria and Ellena were not only quick ; they were eager and attentive and ambitious ; they craved approval and would work tirelessly for it ; they were different in that way , as well as others , from any other children in the school . She hoped Louise would soon shake off that dreadful cough . Every pupil but two had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since Bun and Tom Austin had had it before , the school had not been closed . It seemed to Margaret that she heard more coughs than recitations lately ; somebody was always running to the window and being sick . It was restful to be walking out here by herself , to be going home , her footsteps on the path the only sound except the singing of the frogs . The sky was soft with a pale sunset and the air very still . Suddenly Ed stepped out of the bushes before her . She spread her hands and uttered a cry before she could stop herself , though she knew it was Ed and that he1rao AS THE EARTH TURNShad no patience with such silliness . She saw his smile drop away . " Why  --  " She tried to laugh . " You startled me for a minute . . . What are you doing ? Fencing ? I  --  see you 've got an axe . " " I was just looking them over , " Ed said shortly . He fell into step beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret ventured . " Pretty stout . " His face did not relax . She tucked her hand in his arm , but he made no place for it . They walked on silently . Margaret swallowed her breath , for Ed always glanced at her sharply when he heard her sigh , but it seemed hard that she could not have a pleasant evening after a long day ; it seemed as if Ed never forgave her anything , even what she could not help ; she was noticingthis already . She thought a month married was too soon to begin noticing things . At last Ed said , " I guess you 're tired out . " Then perhaps he was forgiving her , excusing her . She could not be sure from his tone . " Well , it is n't the easiest thing in the world to hear lessons and erase blackboards and hold heads all at the same time , " she began ruefully , half laughing . But Ed shook off her hand . Margaret looked at him in despair . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp against the sky , the skin of his forehead wrinkled . " Yes ; well . What are you doing it for then ? Who asked you to do it ? Anybody would think I could n't keep a wife , and when I got one she had to work out to help support herself . It 's something I never thoughtSPRING 121I 'd come to , having to let the neighbors believe I could n't feed my family " " Oh , Ed , you know it is n't that , " begged Margaret . " Everybody knows I do n't have to teach . It 's only just to finish out the year . You know how it was . The School Committee could n't get anybody else that had taught before , and I did n't want to see Bert Forrest have to repeat his grade how he 's just getting long division straightened out  --  Oh , Ed , you know how it is ! . . . And it does n't really tire me . I like it . . . . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to see that Forrest tribe learn their figures . And you want to see all them Polacks get through whooping-cough withoutturning themselves cross-eyed . And you want to help Mil do her spring sewing and cleaning . Besides that you want to make hot biscuit here three times a day , and mop up every track from off the floors , and God knows what else . Oh , no , you do n't want much beyond reason ; any man could see that . " They rounded the end of the house ; Ed set off toward the barn , his axe jerking sullenly at his side . Jen , who had lived with him all her life , would have smiled to see him , but Margaret , who had lived with him only a few weeks and was his bride , sank down on her doorstep and looked after him miserably . In the barn Ed spoke curtly to his horse . Margaret hid her face on her knees with a small , hopeless sound . The dark thickened . Wind clouds hid the stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went inside with sober steps . As she lit the lamp and tied on her apron she thought of her mother , wished her mother were alive . A mother was the only one who could be depended on to under-122 AS THE EARTH TURNSstand . Then Margaret smiled . She remembered that when she was small , she always turned to her father when her mother failed her , or seemed to fail her . That was a difficulty with having a husband ; he was the only one . Whatever he said or did , it could not be admitted to anybody else ; not by Margaret . She laid the table with her prettiest cloth and the yellow plates and green glassware . She fried potatoes in thin slices , very brown , and the meat separately , as Ed preferred it . The night was damp and cool ; she made cocoa with whole milk and whipped some cream to top it . She cut gingerbread in squares ; that should have dabs of whipped cream on it , too , when it reached the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been finished , not as Mil and Jen did . She paused to look at the gay table in the center of the warm , neat kitchen . She sniffed the rich , toasted smell of frying food . So far she had not failed as a housekeeper even if she was teaching . She could do both and do them well . If she did not wash so much as Mil or bake so often as Jen , still she kept clean clothes on hand and nobody went hungry . Besides , she did things nicely , as she had learned at normal school . The pea and onion and olive salad , now , on green glass plates in lieu of lettuce  --  Jen never would have thought of that . Any old bowl would have done for Jen . And Mil almost never had vegetables . That was why the children caught so many colds . Margaret ran upstairs , feeling suddenly light and happy again . In hers and Ed 's room she lit a lamp and brushed her hair before the big old maple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On it wereSPRING 123arranged many things of hers , and a few of Ed 's ; beyond the half-open closet door their clothes hung together . Behind her was their bed , their one window where the ruffled white curtain blew in like a dancing ghost at night ; sometimes she lay awake and watched it . She liked her own house , not only this room but every room in it . She blew out the light and let her fingerstrail along the wall all the way downstairs . It was sweet to be married . It would be sweet to be a mother . Already there was this possibility . She felt rich in sweetness and excited by a faint , not unpleasant fear of life ; it was a wonder she could ever have been dully miserable . When Ed came in , she stood by the stove , tall and pretty in a yellow apron and not unaware of it . You sit down as soon as you 're washed , " sh said . " I have to run down cellar after the cream at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " She was flushed when she slid into her chair . Stairs always made her breathless . She smiled at Ed . " I made some gingerbread , " she said . " I hope it 's the way you like it . It 's Jen 's recipe . It seems light and good to touch . " Ed passed his plate for macaroni and cheese , looking at her with a reluctant lighting of his eyes . Qualms had assailed him at his milking but he had beaten them off , and left his hair uncombed to irritate her because she liked him neat at table ; a lock of it stuck out now like a brown horn in the middle of his forehead . " Ed , " said Margaret , holding the plate , " I was n't going to teach after June , dear , but I 'll stop now if you really want me to . I 'll stop this week . I 'll let them get124 AS THE EARTH TURNS SPRING 125any kind of substitute they can ... I wo n't do anything you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and took the plate away from her and took a spoon away and pulled her up by her hands . He was grinning now , playing with her . " Sure of it ? " She rubbed her cheek against his chest , nodding . " Say it . " " Yes . " " All right , then . You can finish the term , but not another day after June . You 're my wife and you 're going to act like it , too ; see ? " " Not another day after June , " repeated Margaret . Her fingers lay quiet under his . She could feel his arms hard against her shoulders , his heart beating under her chin , his mouth grinning against her hair . It would always come to this in the end ; she must do as Ed wanted and do it happily , not complaining ; she must see things as he saw them ; for Ed there was only one way . It seemed easy now when he brought her to it by pretending he would force her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was exciting while it was part of love . She shook away the thought of what it would be to live with Ed if love were lost and there were no pretenses left between them . That was nothing she need ever know . " Not another day after June , " she said again , earnestly . VIIMark Shaw ploughed his fields . Ed came one sunny morning , left his wagon in the shade beside the road , and led Tommy through the yard with theclink and rumble of a whiffietree dragging behind . Bob was brought out of the barn and joined to Tommy by buckles and leather straps . " Get up , " said Ed . " Come . " The horses plodded away , their big feet sinking into the turf , the plough on its side at their heels . " We 'll start in here , " Mark Shaw said , " and break clean to the fence . " Ed nodded . " Come . Get up . " The horses surged forward . The point of the plow crept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it firm . The trail stretched back behind him , straight and dark , a grayish darkness not rich but faithful , running east and west over the hill . He would plant sweet corn on the high ground , and potatoesdown below . He walked with steady step , there and back , there and back again . Ed 's eye was true ; he had done well with horses from a boy ; the piece would be a hundred straight rows wide . John brought cold water in a can and stood by while they drank it . " Come . Get up , " said Ed . The blade of the plough was shiny now . It glittered , sliding in . John watched it fascinated , and followed after , seeing the pale roots of turned-under grass , the curling up of worms strange to the sun . Dirt filled his shoes , and Ed 's shoes , and Mark Shaw 's , seeping through their stockings , damp and gritty to their feet . The opening of the ground had changed the air . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thick with an opulent , fertile smell . " My , it 's going to be a great big piece this yenr , " thought Jen , glancing out . " They 'll be hungry enough when it comes dinner time . " She cut dough into dumplings for her soup . George ploughed alone . He always did . When he helped his neighbors he wanted pay for it , not theiriit126 AS THE EARTH TURNShelp in return . He held the plow with the reins looped around his neck , directing the horse with a pull now and then , and with his voice . If the edges of his piece were not quite straight , it did not matter ; the stuff would grow as well one way as another He had had enough of this trying for straight lines when he was a boy at home , before Ed grew old enough to drive the horses ; his father took too much pains with everything . The horse panted , lingered , stopped . George gave her her head and sat down under a tree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , and Kate was old ; her teeth were getting bad . Kate would not last much longer , and he ought to have a new horse , ought to have a pair , but where they would come from was a question . There was no money to be made by farming these days ; a man showed himself a fool to try it . George leaned against the trunk of the tree , resting on the small of his back , smoking . Here he was , thirty years old , with ten years of his life gone into this farm . The land had been run out when he took it , and it was not much better now . He needed more stock to fertilize it , but he had no money for more stock , and if he owned more stock he could not tend it ; he had all the chores he could get through with now . His father said a farmer could not afford to spend time off his place , but it took money to pay doctor 's bills , buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm could do to run itself and feed them and pay up the interest on the mortgage . " Let 's see . When is it that comes due again ? " George wondered , pressing down the tobacco in his pipe . He glanced briefly toward the house . Mil knewSPRING 127about such things and kept the figures . It seemed to him a woman 's business , doling out the money here and there . He could not see why it was some men took such a pride in keeping what they had . Like Ed , now ; Ed said his money was his own , but if a woman wanted some , she had only to ask . George puffed contentedly ; he had no time to bother with the figuring ; Mil would know . She would not cheat him either ; she knew better than that . He stretched and studied the sun , wondering whether it would pay to start the ploughing again until he had had his dinner . " George ! George ! . . . GEORGE ! " It was Mil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in her arms , waving something white over her head . George crawled to his feet and went toward her without answering . Something was the matter or she would not have called him , but whatever it was , he could not raise his voice to shout that distance ; only a woman could manage that . It must be the baby had swallowed something , but if she had , George could not help it . " George , hurry up ! Hurry up , quick ! " Mil was running to meet him , stumbling over the stones George never had time to pick out of his grass , the baby held carelessly under her arm . It was not the baby , then . It might be little George . Big George 's breath quickened ; not the boy ; if it was the boy Mil should not have left him to run off down here . Whateverit was , there was nothing he could do . Mil ought to know it . " George , ca n't you hurry a mite ? One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her calf and she  --  slipped  --  and she 's  --  down . She 's hooking  --  and  --  128 AS THE EARTH TURNSand plunging  --  awfully . I  --  I do n't know  --  I think her leg 's broke , George " Mil 's face was gray with fright and exhaustion . Her hair had shaken off its pins and streamed down her back , a long , thin , dark wisp . She half-sat , half-fell against the side of the hill and tried mechanically to still the shrieking baby , her eyes on George 's face . " Broke ! " George snarled . " You always think the worst . You 're always looking for trouble . " He hurried fast enough now , or as fast he could ; he was getting too fat for speed . Mil watched him disappear , and then sat on for a minute , opening her dress to the baby . It might be he was right . She tried to forget how the brown young cow had looked there , digging up the turf with her hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to right herself if she fell at a disadvantage . Mil rocked the baby gently , smoothing the bib away from the damp pink chin . The sun was warm and bright and the furrows George had turned looked like good soil ; he had not planted here for years ; it might bring a big crop for a change . She rose , still nursing the baby , and took the reins to drive old Kate home . The crabapple tree at the corner of the wall was full of buds , she noticedas she passed ; those apples made fine jelly if she could ever manage to get them cooked and strained and into glasses . Down across the flats she could see the flag waving cheerfully over Margaret 's schoolhouse . She ought to get out oftener , she thought ; it was bad for anybody staying in so much . As a girl , she never expected the worst , the way George said she did now . She had not expected to die when Esther was born , but before this little Vera came she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been shut up in a kitchen all winter would think a cow had to break her leg just because she fell . George was in the shed when Mil went by , standing on a chopping block and reaching up overhead . She stopped . " George  --  what is it  --  what are you after " It 's broke all right , " said George grimly . " It 's broke all right . " Mil took a fresh grip on the baby , and on the reins . A good cow was worth a hundred dollars , and Flossy was the best one they had . " Well , what can you do ? " Mil asked . " What  --  can you do ? " George stepped down from the chopping block with his gun in his hand . He ran his thumb along the barrel to wipe off the cobwebs and jammed a yellow cartridgeinto the chamber . " I can shoot her , " he muttered . " She 'll never amount to nothing any more . That 's the way a man gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mil stood still until she heard the reportof the gun . Then she had all she could do to hold old Kate , who did not like the sound nor the sinister smell ; it almost seemed she knew what lay ahead of horses when their teeth went bad . " Whoa , " said Mil , " whoa , girl , whoa . Whoa , whoa , whoa . " She did not know what they would do now , what would happen next . The three cows that were left would not make nearly enough butter to supply her customers , and if she lost them she would never get them back ; all the foreigners coming into the town , 13o AS THE EARTH TURNSthe French and Polish , were too eager for butter customersand would sell too cheap . If George took money to buy another cow he could not make this paymenton the mortgage as it came due ; with only three to milk , he could not meet the next one . Anybody could plan and plan , but there had to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there never was , not enough to use for getting more ; at least , not on the George Shaw place . The frosts came earlier here than anywhere else , unless George 's stuff was not so forward as it ought to be ; time and again they lost cucumbers , squashes , green beans , and tomatoesbefore they had taken a good taste . The lightningstruck their barn and if it had not been empty of hay , it would have burned to the ground . A plague killed off their pigs one fall and the very next spring the hens ran in circles and died . Now the best cow had broken her leg . " I 'm so thankful you shot her , George , " she called when she saw him , " instead of any other way . " She had not known this thought was in her head . Small , hot tears ran down her face . " She was an awful handsomelittle calf . I used to hold Georgie on her back . We 've got a picture of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said George . " Look out of the way . If you ca n't put up the horse , I 'll have to . I 've got my hands full all right , bleeding and dressing all that meat here almost into hot weather . I guess it 'll be a pretty time of year when I get the planting done . " It always was , but Mil did not think of it . She unhitchedold Kate from the plough with one hand and led her into the barn . George must have had a feeling for Flossy , she thought , or he would have knocked herSPRING 131in the head ; or maybe she had been struggling too much for him to get near to her . Well , it did not do for a man to have too many feelings . There had to be the kind a man was to deal with anything like this . She glanced gratefully at George 's wide , thick shouldersbent over the tool chest in the shed , but she moved rather faster as she passed him . The baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her diaper changed . Georgie , awakened from his morning nap , was howling , too ; the gun must have frightened him . It would be a job now to keep him from noticing what he was too young to understand . " What 's the matter , Georgie ? Stop that ! You did n't hear anything . It was a bad dream . Come downstairs and see little sister . She 's crying too . She 's hungry . If you 're hungry you can have some milk . Come along down . " But when he came she gave him a cookie instead . A little boy ought to have all the milk he could drink ; she knew that from her magazine ; but milk meant butter , and butter was money . With only three cows in the barn , she must be as saving as she could ; not that it would make much difference . She was tired of working and sacrificing for weeks to save ten dollars , and then losing ten times that in the instant that a cow broke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the children would like them as well , for they were crusty , but they did not have the goodness in them . " You stay in the sitting-room , " she ordered little George harshly . " If you come out here , I 'll whip you . Now do n't you dare ! " If he came into the kitchen he would see from the132 AS THE EARTH TURNS SPRING 133back window his father cutting a slash in Flossy 's sleek yellow neck and letting her blood run out and stain the grass . That night as Jen sat at supper she heard a car go past . Her eyes followed it , from time to time , until its headlights had crossed the swamp , disappeared in the walnut grove , and flashed out again on the hill near Ed 's house . She wondered who it might be ; there was not much travel over the lane at night . Later , as she sat by the window rocking , she watched it on its way back and saw it turn into the yard . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool of the evening . " Hullo , pa . " " Hullo , George . Well . Nice night , ai n't it ? " The car door banged . George came up and stood near his father , his foot on the step , his hands in his pockets . " I do n't know . I ai n't took time to notice . I never see anything beat it the way a man has to keep going twenty hours a day to get together something to eat . I ca n't make out what I 'm hanging around here for anyway . With all the chances there is for an ablebodiedman in the cities where he can get big pay for half a day 's work anybody 's a fool to keep at this . " George shifted his weight from his right foot to his left . " I just been telling Ed , we 're a pair of them all right . Not another young fellow in the place that growed up the time we did but what 's off somewhere getting together something without killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ; everybodyknows that . They 've got to do something for the farmers or they 'll be going hungry in the cities beforelong . Nobody 's going to stay out here and drag themselves to death for nothing . Look what Fred Tarbox down at the village gets for just handling over a pound of butter . I sell it to him for thirty-two cents and he sells it out for forty . Eight cents he gets just for passing it from me to somebody else , and see what a farmer has to put into it . Buy the cow and feed and grain and milk her , and make out the butter and cart it down " " Steady customers is better , " Mark Shaw said . George sat down on the step beside his father . " I lost a cow to-day , " he said abruptly . Mark Shaw turned his face toward his son . " The brown one with the light head , " George said . " Best milker I had . Three year old . Fell and broke her leg and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way it goes . I tell you they 've got to do something for the farmers or there 'll be trouble . We do n't get paid to take these chances . They 've got to make some laws . They think they know so much out there to Washington , they 'd better get their heads together " " Where was she ? " Mark Shaw asked . " My cow ? She was out in the back field . I had to turn them in there for a week or two ' dl the grass got up in the pasture . I 'm about out of hay . That 's the way it goes . Nothing lasts over from one season to the next . They do n't take account of how things are changing . It ai n't like it was when men of your age was getting a start . " Mark Shaw looked straight before him , a hand on each knee . " It 's always been so that a man ai n't no business turning cattle into the field , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cattle . There has to be hay enough to last ' til pasturing time , some way or ' nother . That 's a law they ai n't got to make in Washington . It was made before they got there . Mowing ground is soft this time of year and cattle ai n't got no business on it anyway . " " You want to lay the blame on me , " George said . " Well , I want you to know I ai n't to blame for the weather . Last year was a dry year and hay did n't grow . You know hay did n't grow last year . And was I going to let the animals get thin as rails waiting , just on the chance a cow might slip and fall ? I tell you , they 've got to make some allowance for things like this . They 've got to fix it so the farmer do n't have to stand his loss alone . Now , take that cow , worth a hundred dollars . I 'll get thirty for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've got to stand it . I tell you there 's got to be some laws . It ca n't go on this way with all the prices up but ours . They 've got to take account of farmers . " " A cow that 's in a barnyard twice a week through the winter never broke a leg when she was turned out in the spring , " Mark Shaw said . " It 's leaving them tied up so long that does it . And them that cut their hay when it was ripe last summer had enough to last them through . It would n't wait ' til the state road was built to Gypsum , though , the grass would n't . " He did not doubt George was right that farmers should be helped , but he knew they never would be . There was no help but hard work and painstaking and strength and willingness . Without these a man was not a farmer . Mark Shaw sat with his hands on his knees , looking out into the dark , smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wet leaves and the split wood of his pile . " You 're bound to lay the blame on me , " George said sullenly . He gathered himself up and went down to the car , cranked it , slammed the door , and rode away . Mark Shaw did not call him back , but sat on in the dark with the frog-song buzzing in his ears ; and fen sat at the kitchen window behind him , rocking quietly . " It 's too bad they 'll lose their customers , " Jen said at last . " We can spare them butter enough for that , " her father said . " I have some left over for the stores every week . " " It would n't be the same , " Jen said . " Mil has her ways of making out . Customers want the same . " Mark Shaw knew this . The townspeople who bought of George wanted butter of such a deep yellow color it must be stained with a coloring bean , and they wanted it strong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths . They would not like Cora Shaw 's clear , pale squares with only a dash of salt to bring out the flavor . If George carried Cora Shaw 's butter instead of Mil 's , his customers would begin to buy of the Polish and French farmers who hawked their produce along the streets like ragpeddlers , though Doctor Morrisonand the Fairlees bought Cora Shaw 's butter and praised it well ; it was her pride that the best people in the village bought it and would have no one else 's . George sold mostly at the little green houses near the shoeshop , but the money there was as good . " And any way you look at it , " Mark Shaw said , " he ca n't make out on a place that size without four cows . " Ir : 136 AS THE EARTH TURNSThe others were in bed , Mrs. Shaw to rest her head and eyes , Bun for punishment , and John because it was his time . The kitchen was neat and dim . The squeak of Jen 's rocker came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands folded in her lap . " He 'll have to have a cow from here , " Mark Shaw said . " We can spare the one-horned one . " " It 's Lois May 's , " said Jen . " Ma gets the money from her for Lois May . It seems too bad . " " He ought to have let them out to exercise , " Mark Shaw said . " I told him often . I could have let him had some hay , too , if he 'd asked . He did n't need to turn them out so early . " " She 'll likely have to come home , " said fen . " She 'll take it awful hard , to break off now . I do n't know what mall say . " " It 's just to tide him over , " her father answered . " I 'll tell him that . It 's just to tide him over . " He rose , stood for a minute drawing up his shoulders , and went toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed and sat down on the end of the couch to take off his shoes . It was full dark now . He and Jen showed in the room only as shadows against the windows . He felt his way to the chamber door and climbed the stairs slowly . Jen stayed in her chair , rocking again . She could see the stars coming out over the silent house , a new moon down in a corner of the sky , the outline of the pump and the ash tree and the end of the barn . The frogs were still singing as if nothing had happened . It was strange that because George had worked away so much last winter , because the snow in the barnyard had been so deep it would have taken him a long timeSPRING 137to shovel it clear , Lois May must come home from the city . Everything reached so far and touched so many people . Jen heard a stir of talk upstairs , growing higher and higher . She sighed and lit the lamp and stood by the table sorting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A knob turned . There were shuffling steps on the stairs . Mrs. Shaw came down in her white cotton nightdress , with unlaced shoes on her feet , her hair still pinned up as she wore it during the day but loose and sagging . " Did you hear ? " she asked . " Do you know what he says he 's going to do ? He says he 's going to give that cow to George , after he give it to me for Lois May and I been counting on it . I 've worked and slaved and saved to make a few pounds of butter fill out my egg money and keep her where she is . . . I want her to amount to something . I do n't want her back here hanging around . Nobody else cares what happens to her . She ai n't got nobody to lift a hand but her mother . Alls anybody else thinks of is farms and farmingand cattle and seed and dung . . . It 's going to drive me crazy ! I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! I 've got a few rights . He may think I 'll stand everything but I wo n't . What 's George Shaw ? Lazy , fat , long-tongued , empty-headed  --  your father says it 's just to tide him over . Well , I need every cent that cow will make to get the money ready to pay the school bill for the three months that begin in June . What 's going to tide me over ? And you know as well as I do , he 'll never manage to get him another cow , not as long 's he 's got this one ! " " I know it 's awful hard , ma , " Jen said . " I wish you would n't take it so . I know it 's awful hard . " 138 AS THE EARTH TURNSMrs . Shaw leaned against the table , clutching the nightdress together over her flat breast . Her eyes were red and swollen from pain , her mouth deeply indentedwithout the support of her teeth , her face crumpled and dark . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for George Shaw 's slovenliness ? " she cried . " He 's nothing to us . Why do n't your father give up one of his own cows if he 's so willing ? What does it have to be mine for ? He must think I 'm awful easy " " You know , " said Jen . " You know he ca n't spare but one off our own place . We have to keep our customers , too . He needs what the rest bring in to keep us going here . It 's the only way . He do n't want to , but George 's got little young ones , ma ; you 've got to think of them . " " I 've got to think of everything but what I want , have I ? It 's always been so . It 's what I want do n't count , for all I work my fingers to the bone . It 's puttingme out of my head , I tell you . I ca n't stand it any longer . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand it ! " She pushed by jen and went as fast as she could through the entry and across the porch , her shoe laces catching on the rough boards , and her nightdress blowing out behind her in the dark . Her steps were heavy , blind , on the turf of the yard . " Ma , " Jen exclaimed . " Ma ! " She started after hurriedly , and then paused . Softly she closed the outside door and turned out the light . It would not do for Mrs. Janowski or another passing neighbor to stand looking up here , wondering why the lamp burned so late , and then to notice a whiteSPRING 139figure in the orchard . She crept upstairs as quietly as she could , not to wake the children , and crouched by the window in her room . From there she saw her stepmother standing by the garden fence , bent over it , shaken with crying . Even the sound reached fen , a dry choking . Jen rested her forehead against the cool sill . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . Lois May would not go hungry if she did come home ; it was not so bad here , with summer coming on , for anyone ; there was nothing to cry about . She heard Mrs. Shaw coming in slowly , draggingone foot after the other up the stairs . " Did you get chilled through , ma ? " she whispered . " Shall I build up a little fire and fix you a hot drink ? " " No . Leave me alone , " the woman said . She looked very small in the full nightdress . " Leave me alone . That 's all I want . " She went into Mark Shaw 's room and closed the door . Jen knew her father was asleep for she heard him snoring . She placed her clothing neatly over a chair , one piece smooth above another , lay down on the bed , and fell asleep herself , her hand under her firm , round cheek . In the morning Mark Shaw drove up to George 's place with the one-horned cow tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll plant a good lot of them Kentucky Wonders , " Jen said . " That 's the best bean , I believe , ever I cooked . " " I 'm saving seven rows for them , " her father an-140 AS THE EARTH TURNSswered . " And poles all cut for them to run on , too . " " Lowe 's Champion is fine , though , for a bush bean . " " You ca n't beat Lowe 's Champion much , I always said . " Jen stopped in the shed to reach into the bags of seed potatoes her father had been quartering through the last week . They were withered and spongy , but in them she could see the hard , pinkish-brown fruit that they would bear . From this bag would come the round , red Pine Brooks Seedlings , and from those bags the Early Rose , long , crisp white potatoes with pink eyes . The Shaws liked the Early Rose the best of all . But somewhere here there was seed for the Late Rose , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It made an interest in the winter to try one kind and then another , to boil this and bake that , to see which kept its flavor and texture best and made good eating in the spring . " What potatoes are these ? " Mark Shaw would ask . " I got them in the arch , " Jen would say . " They 're the Gold Coin . Gold Coin 's a good potato . " But they liked the Early Rose best , for all around . " Did you save any seed of them big potatoes ma brought down from Kezar Falls that time ? " Jen asked , hearing her father behind her . " I planted them yesterday , " Mark Shaw said . " I let Ed have some , too . We do n't want to let them run out . Nobody else ever raised that kind around here . " He loaded two of the bags and some wooden measuresand a hoe on his wheelbarrow and called to John . Jen stood in the shed door and watched them go across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . None of the other children had ever been so faithful as John to the spring work , not one ; JohnSPRING ' 4 ' had something in him . It might not be that he helped much this year , but it was good for him to get the feel of the sun on his back and the loose dirt under his feet ; and next year this time he would be six , and after that , seven . " The ground is covered with dandelions , " thought Jen . " I must get me a knife and pail and dig a good mess for dinner . " She liked to walk through the grass in the morning , and reach down into the roots of things , tenderly and gratefully , to get food that cost nothing and was fresh and damp with dew . There was nothing better than wild greens in the spring . Toward the middle of May , Margaret spent a Saturdayin the field with Ed . It was not usual in Shaw women to work out-of-doors , but Margaret had insistedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chimney tops of their house were visible to them , nor the ridgepole of their barn . It was almost as if they had no buildings , but were a peasant couple travelled out to the solitude of their own plot of land . The lilac bushes by the fence were budded and the plum trees in full bloom . Strawberries had blossomed all along the edges of the ploughed piece . A bobolink sang in the marsh . Margaret walked first , in a short plaid gingham dress with no sleeves , dropping corn , and Ed followed , dropping beans . She could feel him , tall and steady , behind her . Sometimes he spoke . " There goes a bluebird . See him ? Over the hill now . " After a few rows he set down his pail of beans and began covering what they had planted , with the crisp sound of metal moving the soil . " Tired , puss ? " He142 AS THE EARTH TURNSasked her . She shook her head but he put his arm around her while they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , Ed . Just happy . " Ed grinned . This was life as he liked it , everything simple and in its place . They ate their lunch in the shade of a walnut tree on the side hill . Margaret had brought biscuit with home-cured ham between , hard-boiled eggs , and cake , and sweetened tea in glass bottles . When they had finished , Ed lay with his head in Margaret 's lap and she fingered his thick , damp hair , smoothing it back from his forehead where his hat had stuck it down . She felt at ease with him out here , more than she did in the house , much more than before they had been married . She knew him now , and all his ways , and how to please him ; it was not always easy to do , but she knew how . Ed lay relaxed , his hand unthinking against her , his mind wandering over this which stretched out for acres on all sides of his body and which belonged to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not so hard as they would have been to another ; they were his . He felt the softness of the grass , too , and knew that it would grow , that he would fill his barn with it by and by and the yellow sides of Jersey cows become sleek and round . " Sing me something , why do n't you ? " he asked . Margaret flushed . " Somebody might hear , " she said . " I could n't . " " Say one of your poems then . " " Oh , I could n't . " He lifted himself on his elbows and grasped her wrists . SPRING 143 " Say one ! " She said the first lines she could think of . " The lark 's on the wing , The snail 's on the thornAt the end she added , " I 'm not sure that 's right , Ed ! " " It 's good enough , " Ed said . " I know what it means . That 's what it 's for , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess so , " Margaret answered shyly . It was good to have Ed speak of poetry . She sat looking down at him , feeling him heavy and hot beside her , and wondered how women told men when there were going to be children , and what men did then . She had never talked with Mil of such things , for Mil had a bitter , shame-faced way about them , and all that Margaret knew she had read in books . It did not say in the books how a woman told her husband she expected to have a child , especially when she was not sure . Except in story books where the wife whispered , " I think I 'm going to have a baby , darling . Are you glad ? " Margaret could not speak to Ed like that ; she would feel queer . The word " baby " had too silly a sound to be said to Ed , and she never called him " darling . " To Ed it would have to be told as if it did not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it at all . She did not mind . To-day she was not in the least afraid . She felt strong and capable out here . Bearing another Shaw would be a fine thing to do . If he came as she expected she could bring him into the field next spring , and let him lie on a blanket in the sun while his father planted corn and beans in hills and covered144 AS THE EARTH TURNS SPRING 145them . She felt proud now that he had happened so soon ; she must be a natural mother . " Well , " said Ed . " This wo n't do the planting . " She walked back beside him to the piece and they worked steadily . She would be careful , she thought . She would eat the right things . She would nurse her baby and keep him pink and round . Her children would never go as Mil 's went so much , with dirty hair and uncut nails and ragged stockings ; she was thinkingalready of more than one , of a boy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish it Monday , if the weather 's fine , " Ed said . They stood looking back over what they had done . Margaret wondered if even now the kernels she had planted in the morning might be beginning to stir . If the soil was good they ought to be , she thought proudly . They went up the hill side by side , Ed pushing the wheelbarrow . The grass was tall enough to brush Margaret 's ankles as she walked . Carefully they followed the track they had made comingdown , not to leave two paths . The sun set in a burst of color as it had the night before and would the next night . It was a stretch of clear weather just now . A whippoorwill sang in the lilac bush . Ix " No , now do n't you leave off , ma , " Jen said when a fish peddler drove into the yard . " I 'll go . . . . None to-day , Mr. Robinson , but you might stop next time if you have a nice haddock just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave off for anything , ma , if you think there 's chance of getting them done . " Mrs. Shaw had been at work for days now , dyeingsheeting yellow and binding lengths of it with orange and white checked gingham once intended for a Sundayapron for herself . These were to be hung at the windows of Lois May 's room , and the best white woven spread put on the bed . The room was freshly cleaned already and a new rag rug laid before the bureau , the pink wash bowl mended , and two sepiatintedpictures , one of Cupid awake and one of Cupid asleep , hung on the walls . The pictures had been Mil 's contribution , sent over by Esther the day before , and leaving bare-looking spots on the faded , water-streaked walls of Mil 's own bedroom . " I wish I could do something more , " Mil wrote on blue-lined paper . " It 's such a shame , poor young one . " Mil wore a harried , humbled look these days whenever she saw any of the Shaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt George denied . " It 's awful handsome , ma , " Jen said . " It ai n't much , " said Mrs. Shaw , " put up against what she 's had . She 's wrote about them rooms of Lize 's , every one with curtains at the windows , and some of them silky stuff . " " I guess it 's nice , " Jen said . " Must be they ca n't see out much though . " She liked to see out . " It 's the way folks do now , " said Mrs. Shaw . " Folks that is anybody . " There was to be a company supper to welcome Lois May . Ed and Margaret would come , and George and Mil and the children . Jen had a piece of beef already boiled , waiting to be fricasseed , and she planned for smothered potato with onion in it , biscuit dropped from a teaspoon to make them small and pointed on146 AS THE EARTH TURNSthe top , well beaten sponge cake , and ice cream full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sweet mixed pickle , which Lois May had always fancied . It seemed too bad she must leave the school before she had finished , but there was no other way ; Ed and Lize had done what they could in the beginning ; a frantic letter from Mrs. Shaw to Ralph had brought no reply ; so Lois May would be home now in a few days . To Jen it was as simple as a storm or falling on an icy step or catching measles ; she had no capacity for resentingit ; there was left only to make Lois May 's comingas pleasant as possible , and so she planned for smothered potato and sponge cake and walnut ice cream , and made Lois May 's room clean and bright . It was she who had suggested the yellow curtains . And she thought of taking Bun into her room from now on . Lois May would be used to a bed to herself . Cleaning vegetables in the sinkroom , she sang cheerfully . It was the twenty-ninth of May with danger of frost past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crops were growing rank . Strawberries should ripen in another week or two ; the banks of ditches would hang red . Woods berries had blossomed thick , blueberries and raspberries , and anybody willing to go into the swamps would pick a bushel of huckleberriesin a day . There were " on " years and " off " years ; this was an " on " year . " So go to sleep , my ba-aby , my ba-aby , " sang Jen . From the open sinkroom window she could see the Janowskis at work on their planted piece . Stan had ploughed very nearly all of one field six weeks ago or more , and since then it seemed to Jen she never looked out without noticing three or four or five men , SPRING 147women , and children busy there . It was strange to see a woman and girls in the field except for a bit of cultivatingor to get green stuff fresh for dinner , but with so many at work on it , the Janowski piece was not only the largest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well along , as tendedlookingas Mark Shaw 's smaller one . The Old Joe place was turning out to be a real farm after many years of lying idle ; people stared at it as they rode past ; Mark Shaw watched its progress with level , approving eyes . " So go to sleep Bun came in from school , bringing the mail , a letter for Mrs. Shaw , and the newspaper . " There , this is from Lois May , poor young one . I suppose it says when we should expect her , " Mrs. Shaw said fretfully . " Now I should think Mil and George would feel fine to see her back here . I should certainly think they would . Bernice , could n't you get a pail of cool water from the well ? My mouth and throat 's terrible parched . " Jen sniffed the air made sweet by the drying swath of grass her father had cut to make a road to the vegetable garden . The apple trees were now in full leaf and full bloom , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate-colored gravestones settled at a slant into the lower corner of the field beside the lane . She could not read the names engraved on them , but she knew what they were . Joseph Watson , 1820-1891 , and James Watson , son of Joseph and Hannah Watson , 1844-1863 . The grave of Hannah Watson lay beside her husband 's and because she had died last , she had no marker , unless the pine tree growing there148 AS THE EARTH TURNSmight count as one . To-morrow two men would drive up and leave a basket of flowers and a flag for Joseph because he had fought in the Civil War , and for James because he had died on his way home from it , but they would not have anything for Hannah because she had only identified her son James one hot summer day on the platform of North Derwich station , and raised all the food her husband ate for the twenty years he sat in a chair in her kitchen , and done washings for Mrs. Hale to buy monuments for them at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if Jen found time to go down and set out the pansy plants in the ground , stray cows were sure to eat them off before the summer was over ; and the Forrest children would take the flags to play with . Nothing would interfere with the tree . " Well , now , here 's news ! " cried Mrs. Shaw . " Here 's a piece of news for you , Jen ! " She came hurrying to the sinkroom door , trailing yellow cloth behind her . Her eyes were shot through with triumph , her face tight with satisfaction ; she looked smaller than ever . " Lois May 's got a job ! " Jen put down her knife . " A job ! " " Yes , ma'am , she 's got a job ! Now ai n't that a young one , I want to know ? You ca n't keep that kind down so easy ! ... She says here she and Lize have been hunting ever since she heard I could n't send the money , and Tuesday night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , and goes to work Monday morning . Now what do you think of that ? " SPRING 149 " It 's fine , " jen said . " My , that 's fine . " " Ai n't that some of it ? " insisted Mrs. Shaw . " To get out and get herself a job where she wo n't be dependent on anybody ? She 'll get somewheres in this world , and you need n't think she wo n't . Spunk , that 's what she 's got , when she 's put to it ; all her father 's folks was just the same . " " It was Lize , being mad again , got her that job , " thought Jen . " Minnie Foote spunk found that job , if I do n't miss my guess . " Aloud she said , " I do n't suppose , then , she 'll get home ? " " She says here she wo n't , " Mrs. Shaw answered , her fingers twitching at the letter . " I want to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . She 's got now where she can show folks they ca n't hit out at her so easy . She 'll go ahead fast , you see if she do n't , and some that 's took her needs so light will see the day they 'll wish they had n't . . . I 'd just like to have seen her go in asking for that job ! " " I 'll bet she walked airy , " Jen laughed . Bun came in out of breath , slopping water from her pail . " What 'd you say , ma ? Ma , ' d you say Lois May was n't coming home ? ' D you say she was n't coming home ? " " No , she ai n't coming home , " Mrs. Shaw said . " Your sister ai n't so easy beat . She 's got herself a job without an education " But Bun was not listening . She turned tragic eyes on Jen . " Then wo n't we have the ice cream ? " she asked mournfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , we will , " exclaimed Jen with sudden resolve . " We 'll have a big supper just the same , and George and Ed will come , and their folks . " " I 'm awful glad this turned out so , " she thought , " for Mil 's sake . It 's always George gets them into trouble , and then she takes the brunt . " " I should think I could have up the curtains just the same , " Bun was saying , " now they 're about made . How would it hurt ? " She put on her sweet expression . " 1 like pretty curtains , too . " Her mother looked at her in surprise , her face softened . It seemed that Bun was growing older ; she might in time have nice ways like Lois May 's . " Well , there , " she agreed . " You can . I do n't know who 's got a better right . " " Whoopee ! " Bun said , relaxing . " And Jen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks now when nothing broke the even , steady progress of the days . Every morning the cows were milked a few minutes earlier than the morning before , for Mark Shaw rose by the sun , and old Lina 's sides were more distended for she had not given down for several weeks and would come in at mid-month with her seventh calf ; every one so far a son , poor Lina , bound to leave her with her bag still heavy for him . The chickens had longer necks and legs and stiff , new feathers patching their bare bodies ; Jen remarked it as she fed them , cracked corn instead of warm mush now . After breakfast the men found the corn each day grown taller in the fields , taking on a darker green ; Mark Shaw 's and Ed 's , which had been planted when the white oak leaf was the size of a mouse 's ear , would reach knee-high by the Fourth , which was as it should be . Peas trembled on the edge of flowering , slid into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The grass was tall enough now to lodge in a rain , but no rain came , and Ed taught John how to hold a wide blade between his153154 AS THE EARTH TURNS SUMMER 155hands but John could not make the whistling sound Ed made ; next year he would . The lilacs blossomed , the syringa bush at the corner of the house , the sweetwilliamand flowering almond in the garden . Every night the air was sweet , and every night dark came later , more birds shared the business of settling in their nests , the leaves were bigger on the ash and maple trees , making a stouter sound when the wind blew through them . In the afternoons Margaret went into the field behind the house and picked strawberries . They grew thick there by the fence and along the ditches , places where it did not break the grass for her to walk ; in the corner by the pasture the small , wild plants made a bed as if they had been planted , and she could sit down and pick quietly , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries with the other , dropping them into a blue-banded lard pail . " I wonder if I ought to eat them , " she thought , " now . " She decided against it , though she was feeling better than since the first of April ; quite well , in fact . Sometimesshe wondered whether it was wise to make all her decisions for herself , when this was her first time , but no one else knew of her condition . She turned away the word condition ; nobody knew yet that she was with child . Nor was that the way to say it . There seemed to be no way . The thing itself was so sweet , so secret , so terrifying , that human beings had no word for it . There were no words for the grass , except to tell its color , nor for the sun except that it was hot and bright ; and it was more than that ; the berries knew , lying here all day and all night while spring went by and summer came on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things , but only dimly felt them . She thought that it would be fine if she could have her child in warm weather , and be out here alone in the sun where nobody would know when she cried out ; if she could wash it herself in the pool of the brook under the hill and wrap it in a little blanket she had brought and take it out to where Ed was at work and say laughing , " Here is something for you . " She did not pity the Indian women who only stopped beside the trail and had their young and then went on ; she envied them ; but that might be because she did not know . In any case , there was no use in these thoughts , for her baby would be born at Christmastime , and even Indian women , she supposed , must have stayed by a fire in the winter . She thought of all the things that she had sent away for and had ready , the blankets , the silk-and-wool bands , the funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feathery powder puff in a blue celluloid box ; and she thought of what she would name it , if it was a girl . But she did not believe it would be a girl . She laughed aloud , and the sound frightened her . Early in June came the last day of school . On that day there was no studying . The children did not arrive until eleven o'clock , and by then the schoolroom had been turned into a party place , lavishly strung with yellow and white crepe paper and decorated with buttercups and daisies . A program of poems to be recited and songs to be sung lay in the exact center of each desk . The children , dressed in their best , stood on Margaret 's platform and made their contributions , 156 AS THE EARTH TURNSBun 's voice too loud and her manner too boisterous for the occasion , and Kathie Forrest whispering so softly of " vacation " and " summer days " and " birds " that no one could hear more than the key words . John and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janowskis had come as guests and sat in the front seats hushed with wonder at witnessing what took place in School . Margaret awarded a pocket dictionaryto Manuel who had not been absent all the term , and another to Bun who had not been tardy , and a picture of two gray kittens with blue ribbons around their necks to Betty who wrote the best hand . Then they sang a closing song and went out in the yard to eat their lunches together and finish with the ice cream Margaret had made and Ed had left , packed in ice , in the woodshed on his way to market in the morning . " Well , now , I guess that 's all for this year , " Margaret said . " Pick up your papers and put on your hats and get in line . Remember you 're going to sing Vacation time is here again , ' and go on singing and keeping step until by looking over your shoulders you ca n't even see the flag any more ! " But they were slow to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . " Come , children ; come . " " Well , " sputtered Bun , reappearing with a package under her arm , " well  --  we got something for you . Here ! " She stood a little before the others , her face hot with embarrassment , her braids frowsy from being tossed about in the heat , her new teeth very large in her small mouth . SUMMER 157 " You said we should n't ever give you nothing that  --  that cost , " she was panting , " and we did n't . It never cost anything . Nobody even knows about it but us . There 's one from every one of us , every single one . And I expect  --  I expect you 'll want to keep them because  --  they 're  --  very  --  good . They 're what we thought when we  --  when we  --  thought  --  about  --  you ! " She thrust the package into Margaret 's hands with energy , and because the fingers that had tied it were not used to tying , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Margaret knelt swiftly to gather them into her hands and saw the bits of writing that she knew , Manuel 's so big and blundering , Kathie 's faint and small , Betty 's even as the copybook 's , Harry 's with the b 's and k 's all made like h 's ; and she felt the yellow roughness of school paper and the crumpled stickiness of everything children handle . " My Teacher , " they had written . " My Teacher " " Why , this is lovely , " Margaret said . " Nothing could have pleased me so much . " She felt as if she might cry . " Now get into line , children . Va-ca-a-6m ti-ime is here again  --  ' Mark time ! ... March ! " When one group had disappeared around the turn and the other under the hill , she sat down on the step in the afternoon sunshine . Around the building ran a well-beaten path where sorrel would grow before September when boys would come back to race along it and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be here then . Her lap was full of the writing of children she would not teach again . She might never turn into this yard until she158 AS THE EARTH TURNScame to bring a son of her own . There was nothing of the work left for her except with the child who was coming and he seemed suddenly long on the way . She opened Harry 's blotted offering . " My teacher can singEvrything . She brings Pitures of thingsFor us to see . She is very very veryGood to me . " " I got a dictionary , " sang Bun , bursting into the kitchen at home . " Lookut . Is n't it swell ? That 's for never being tardy . Not even once ! " " Well , I should say , " Jen agreed . " Now , that 's handsome , do n't you say so , ma ? . . . Well , John , you old step-and-fetch-it , how did you behave at school ? " " He was good , " said Bun . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All of the rest of them talked out loud but John never . " " They give something to Margaret , " John said . " What was it they give to Margaret , Bun ? " " Oh  --  nothing , " Bun answered vaguely . She began to splash at the sink , singing and snorting as she scrubbed her face . IIToward the last of June 011y came home . At one time Jen had expected him on the tenth , when his examinations were over , but at the last minute he wasSUMMER 159offered the chance to work about the grounds during Commencement week , and afterward to help put the buildings in order for the summer session . " Can father spare me from the hoeing ? " he wrote Jen . " I hate to ask him but this is a good-paying job ; forty cents an hour for as long as I want to work . " " The weeds are not so bad as some years , " Jen wrote back . " Father says if you are here in time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut early , the grass has shot up so , and since it come off hot it will be turning yellow . We are fine at home and hope these few lines find you just the same . Lois May writes that she . likes it where she is . Lina has got a heifer calf . That makes two heifer calves this spring . Father give one to John and one to Bun . They are pretty tickled . Now you take care of yourself and do n't work too hard and it will be all right as long as you get here in time for the haying . " The night he came Jen was making biscuit for supper . As she straightened from sliding them into the oven , her glance passed the window and she saw him cutting across lots through the pasture , and stopped to watch him , smiling . That was 011y . He never walked with the firm , tranquil tread of his father and George and Ed , but moved jerkily , sometimes stumbled over rough places , for his mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had followed the cows up the lane in the days when what were now becoming John 's " chores " had been his ; how the young heifers would get away from him because he forgot to watch them close ; how he had stubbed his bare toes until they bled . Now here he was a grown16o AS THE EARTH TURNS SUMMER 161man in a neat blue suit and a stiff straw hat , coming home from college . It was a wonder what a few years would do ; and yet they had not really changed him , only put him in a place where he fitted . " Hullo , 011y ! Well , I guess you 're hot enough , walkingall that ways in this heat ! . . . No , now do n't you come in here where I 've got fire going . You step right into the kitchen and I 'll be there in a minute . " She baked in the shed-room now , and kept the kitchen stove cold except on cool , damp mornings . The change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shed-room she could get a quick , high heat but it never kept so regular for long , slow baking . The most that the family missed was her fruit cakes and it was probable they were too heavy for hot weather anyway . " Look out of my way , " said 011y . " This is just where I am coming . What you cooking  --  biscuit ? Let 's have one ! " " Oh , 011y ! ! They 're not done ! . . . You 'll burn your fingers ! There , what did I tell you ? " For 011y had shaken open the oven door with his knee and snatched out a biscuit , a big one , still spongy and white . It was so hot that he could not hold it , but had to keep tossing it from one hand to the other ; and there was no telling when he had washed his hands . He had not even taken off his hat . " You told me I 'd burn my fingers and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . Just the way I like them ,  --  rawish and chewy ! " " Not even any butter on it , 011y " I ca n't wait for butter . I 'm starved . . . . Say , butthis is good . I have n't tasted anything like it in months , and that 's the truth , fen . " Jen laughed with pleasure . It was like 011y to beI impatient and appreciative , but he talked more thanhe used to , and smiled more ; his eyes used to be serious but now they had a glint Jen could not describeto herself . " You 've picked up a saucy look down there to college , " she said at last . " I should n't wonder if you 'd need training before the summer is over . Now you get out of this shed-room as I told you and go wash yourself and change out of your clothes , or you wo n't get another mite of supper . Now you mind what I say . " " Oh , Jen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Well , you march , then , " she scolded contentedly . " And do n't forget behind your ears and up into the edge of your hair . You 're all soot off the train . " The next day he worked for twelve hours with his father in the field . He did not hold his hoe quite right , nor use it easily , but none ever set a pace that left him behind . At night he was exhausted , and could not eat much supper . Jen noticed but did not speak of it , and when she had finished the dishes she went out and sat beside him on the steps . He had a lonesomelook , she thought , sitting there in shrunken overalls and a black shirt opened down his lean , white chest ; he always did at home , for the children never followed him about as they did Ed , and Mark Shaw avoided the silences that fell between them when they were idle , though he liked to speak to him in passing and watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you think , " said fen , " we do n't make much of your coming home , after you 've been away six months ! Letting you work the whole first day - . " 011y lifted his head from leaning against the post of the porch and smiled . " I have to get my hand in . " He spread his palm and even in the half-light she could see the blisters on them . " That was no way , " said Jen disapprovingly . " I did n't think they 'd do that , " 011y explained , " after all the lawns I 've mowed , but of course it was a differentgrip . " " Was that hard work down there at college ? " Jen wanted to know . " Which ? " 011y asked .

" " I meant  --  whatever you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbly . " Mostly putting up bunting , " said 011y . " And takingit down again . And mowing lawns . No , that was n't hard . " After a minute he added , " It is n't any of it hard  --  when you feel you 're getting somewhere . " " Do many of them have to earn their own way , like you ? " Jen asked . She did not want 011y to seem less than the rest . " A good many , " 011y answered . " That 's what makesjobs hard to get . " Jen wriggled herself comfortably into the crevice between the steps . Jobs were hard to get , but 011y could get them . He had earned six hundred and tenSUMMER 163dollars beside going to school this year , she knew from the account book on his bureau ; that was more than George and Ed had done at his age with their full time . He was not big like them , but he had something in him ; Jen called it starch . " I meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " but Mil and two of the children are down sick . It seems to be kind of an epidemic going round . They had it down to Forrest 's this last week . Crampy pains in their heads and stomachs . " " They 're always having something up to George 's , " 011y said lazily , his eyes shut . " There , I know it , " sighed Jen . " I do n't see what 's the reason . If it is n't stomach upset , it 's sore throat or colds or ivy poison . I was up yesterday cleaning and baking and I told George if he 'd come after me I 'd go up for a while in the morning and take some cooked stuff . " " How is it you have to do everything ? " asked 011y . It always irked him . " What 's the matter with Margarettaking a turn ? " Jen was silent . It had come dark now . She could hear Mrs. Shaw singing to the children upstairs ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Bun chattered and would not listen , and John fell asleep before she was well begun . The bell of the heifer that was running wild through the summer tinkled in the marshes . " It is n't suitable , " Jen said quietly , " for Margaret to go where catching sickness is just now . I told Edso. " 011y whistled. 164 AS THE EARTH TURNS " They do n't say anything , " said Jen , " so we do n't . I just told Ed not to let her go up there ' til they 're over this and he said he would n't . Of course I may be wrong , but I do n't think so . " She turned her head and spoke into the dark window . " Father , what makes you set in there ? It 's real cool where the air gets at you . Tell ma to come out , too . It 's stifling upstairs . " A little later Mark Shaw and his wife brought their chairs and placed them on the grass before the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite plainly , and the outline of the house and shed and barn , and the trees of the yard and orchard . Mark Shaw and Jen sat much alike , bent forward with their knees apart , staring at the ground . 011y leaned , relaxed , against the post , his hands thrust into his pockets . Mrs. Shaw yawned and stretched her feet beforeher , letting them rest on the heels with the toes turned up . " Hoo-oo , hum ! " she said . " Nobody knows how the soles of my feet burn if I stand on them any time at all , like I did making out that butter . . . . There 's enough for your customers all right , Mark , and that 's a miracle , with one cow off the place and two calves sucking . " Nobody answered . It did not mean they had not heard , or were not gratified . " I see the peas are almost full a'ready , " Jen said dreamily . Mrs. Shaw slapped at a mosquito just as 011y did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said 011y . " Did you get yours ? " SUMMER 165 " I never do , " his stepmother answered . " Mark says I 'm too quick for ' em . Says I get there before they do . " Later Mark Shaw said , " You cal'late you and me and Ed can fill three barns this side of August , 011y ? " " Three barns ! " " George , he 's going to work over to Freeside for the Oakeses . They 've got sixty acres there of mowing land alone . It will take him six weeks anyway , he says , with favorable weather . " " What 's the idea ? We do his work while he goes earning ? " " Well , he 's got to let his place out to halves , " Mark Shaw said gently . " I thought with our crew we could do it as well as anybody . Bun , she 's going to tread the loads , she says , and John there , he 's going to do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , how ' 1l George get through the winter on a half a crop of hay ? " Jen exclaimed . " He thinks to buy , " her father told her . " Oh , yes , " repeated Mrs. Shaw significantly . " He thinks to buy ! " Mark Shaw made no reply to this . He sat on in the light of the moon , his big shoulders stooped , his thick hair standing straight up from his forehead , staring at the ground . 011y laid his cheek against the cool , painted post and sprawled along the floor of the porch , listening to the cowbell . " Sure , " he said . " We can do it all right . George has n't got much over there to cut if it 's like most years . We wo n't notice it , along with the rest . Ed 's crop as good as yours ? " " Full , " Mark Shaw said proudly . " Full as good , if166 AS THE EARTH TURNSnot a little mite better . He ploughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down and rain come just the right time . He planned it good . I do n't doubt there ai n't no better grass anywhere in the state . " 011y remarked the change in his voice and the way Jen 's eyes lifted and sought Ed 's light over on Walnut Hill . He smiled wryly in the dark , thinking of speeches he had made , comments he had seen on his examination papers , the scholarship he had won , even of money he had earned , and wondered what all that together would mean to his father beside one good crop of grass that Ed grew . He did not know what either of them was thinking , nor how their minds fumbled with pleasure in his willingness to help at home and with bewilderment at what he did while he was away , wanting to ask , and not knowing how . " Well , " 011y said , " I guess I 'll turn in . I 'm getting stiff sitting here . " As he felt his way through the dark kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expect approval ; the greater a man was the less he got of it ; that had been so all down through the ages . In a way it was good to be home , and he must not ask too much . He had his books . With Browning and Keats and Robinson on the table in his room , and Ridpath 's " History of the World , " Sullivan 's " Turn of the Century , " Ibsen 's plays and a new psychology text and Shakespeare 's complete works , a fellow needed nothing more except the time to read them . " His hands are covered with blisters , " said Jen softly . " I could n't keep him back , " Mark Shaw said . " HeSUMMER 167was bound to be even with me all the way , and he was , too . I never see such a boy . " " He ai n't strong , " said Mrs. Shaw . " John 'll be a good deal stouter at his age . " John was her son . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ought to work in easy , that 's all . You let him rest in the morning , Jen . " " I 'll let him rest ' til noontime if he will , " said Jen . The wind was freshening . It would be a good night to sleep . The heifer 's bell tinkled more and more quietly in the marshes . IIIOn Sunday the church at the fork of the road above George 's place opened for the summer months . The eight families in the neighborhood could not support a minister for the year round but they could pay one five dollars a Sunday to drive up from the village through July and August , and they did . The women had cleaned the building a week before and made a kind of picnic of it , eating their lunches in the shade at the back ; they had even painted steps and whitewashed fences and filled the hanging lamp with fresh oil . As Jen dressed for the two o'clock serviceshe recalled how neat and sweet-smelling the meetingroom had been when she turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water , the platform carpet turned and mended , the faded blue and yellow satin ribbons that marked the pulpit Bible rid of dust , the yellow wooden shutters closed to keep out the heat. 168 AS THE EARTH TURNS SUMMER 169 " Ma , " Jen called . " Ma ! You ready ? " " She 's out picking flowers , " 011y answered from his room . " Yes , she looks ready . " " You 're going , are n't you , Oily ? " Jen asked , after a minute in which she flung her bath water out of the back window , scrubbed the bowl vigorously , hung her towels to dry , and shook talcum powder over her shoulders. 011y had not thought of going . He had just finished with a year of required church attendance and now lay on his bed reading " My Last Duchess " in such a position that he could look beyond the book to where his stepmother in a green muslin dress went back and forth in the garden and Bun and John sat sedately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He liked the ease and quiet of Sunday , when even Mark Shaw only walked about his land with arms folded across his back ; there was time then to notice the clouds in the sky , the thinness of the maple leaves , the smell of flowers and hot grass , the sound of crickets and grasshoppers and of the brook running through the meadow ; and all these things he enjoyed . It was only the slavishness of farming that had driven him away . " Are n't you , 011y ? " " Oh  --  I guess not . " " Folks 'll be disappointed , " Jen said , buckling her white canvas slippers . " Several has spoke of seeing you this Sunday . " 011y rolled over on his back . He wanted to go , and did not want to go . It was pleasant here and his collar would be hot and the sermon would bore him . But once was the time Sunday was the day he waited for , the only time when he heard music and speaking ; until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when he was seven the Elder had put his hand on his head and said , " This is the one you 'll have to give to the Lord , Mark . He 's got gentle ways . " 011y had thought at first that being given to the Lord meant dying , and he cried in bed at night until fen heard him and made him tell her why and explained that it only meant being like the Elder . 011y chuckled . He wondered if she remembered that . . . And the people here must not think he did not want to see them , that college had given him a big head as some of them had prophesied . He stood up and began pulling off his clothes . " Well , do n't wait for me , " he called to Jen . " I 'll walk . I 'm not quite ready . " " In all this heat ? " " I 'll like it . You go on . " When he went into the church , Margaret had just finished playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing the congregation , her head bent slightly under her wide-rimmed pink hat , waiting for the prayer . 011y slid into a vacant pew on the west side ; few ever sat there , though the seats on the east were so full that people 's shoulders touched . He watched them from between his eyelids and found them as he had remembered . Mil and her children occupied the front pew , the one flanking the organ , and when Margaret had finished playing , she would sit with them . A Hattie Lord and her three daughters , Flora , Annie , and Sarah Louise had taken that place when first the church was built , for Hattie sang alto , and Flora and Annie strong sopranos , and it was170 AS THE EARTH TURNSboasted that Sarah Louise could take any part but bass , whichever was most needed ; they were sometimes called the Lord quartet . When Sarah Louise married she still sat there , and brought her two daughters , Mildred and Margaret ; Flora had shared it during her lifetime , but Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Margaret 's pew now as long as services were held in the church , and their children 's . Behind them were George and Ed and Jen , children of Minnie Foote , daughter of George Foote who could not sing a note , but had given the ground for the church . 011y could remember his mother herding them all into that second row of seats on the rare Sundays when she appeared at Meeting . The third was the Mary Eliza Shaw pew , and Mark Shaw sat in it for he was her son , and Cora Shaw because she had no place of her own here , and Bun and John because it was where they belonged . The Hales had their place , and the Forrests , the Austins , the Jellisons , the Grants , the Walkers , and the Carpenters . The Janowskis sat where they might , for they were newcomers ; there were seats enough . There were no rules about it . It was only that each one sat where his mother had trained him to go . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint still sticks , " 011y thought . As children all the Shaws had been supplied with folded papers to place at their backs as they sat down ; without protection they brought home pale green stripes across their shoulders . Elder Finnie from the village was a young man , fair-haired , hard-working , enthusiastic . He read with feeling , sang with fervor , preached with a terribleSUMMER 171earnestness . The congregation listened to him attentively , but kept their eyes on Elder Hobbs who sat , sweet-faced and calm , on the horsehair chair beside the pulpit , too old now to safely preach a sermon in hot weather , but by whose word they had all been reared , every one except the Janowskis and Cora Shaw . Mil and Margaret had known the time when , as they sat in the front pew , they watched him leaning toward them with his arm resting on the big Bible , an old , whitebeardedman even then , with a thick gold chain swinging across his snowy pique vest , and distinctly saw a halo round his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they saw it now ; it must be it was visible only to little girls ; she did not believe the Elder had lost it . She was glad he had lived to marry her and Ed ; it made her feel completely married . They rose and sang . " Brother Hobbs , will you pronounce the benedic-tion ? " It was good to hear the familiar voice . " I want first to speak a word to my Father , Who is here . . . Lord , we thank Thee for past mercies and ask boon for the future . Grant us hot , dry weather for the weeks of haying . Grant us the will and strength to labor in our vineyards , and give us to enjoy the fruits therefrom . But if this be not Thy will , and pests must come , and frost and storm , help us to know it is Thy judgment and to fear not , for Thou wilt provide . " Elder Finnie had not thought to include haying and harvest in his prayer , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took old Elder Hobbs to know the first need of the parish ; he had fields of his own . " In Christ 's name we ask it . . . And now may the Lord watch between thee and me while we are absent one from another . " Margaret played softly on the organ . In the hush that followed Elder Hobbs went along the aisles , shaking hands with the women , nodding at the men , patting the children on the head . This much at least he was not yet too old to do , and the ministers from the village always left it to him . " Well , Mildred , I 'm pleased to see you out . No wonder it 's hard for you sometimes with all the little ones . " He spoke in a half-whisper , smiling until his forehead shone . " Hullo there , son . God bless you , children ; God bless you . . . Mrs. Margaret , I enjoyed your music . Always enjoy your music . . . George . Ed . How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see your boy is home from school . That 's fine , that 's fine . May he use his knowledge in the service of the Lord ! . . . Your flowers were beautiful , Mrs. Shaw . You enjoyed the sermon , I know . . . Amen , amen .. . Bless you , my dear . . . Ah " When the Elder had passed by , the service was over . People gathered into groups or leaned across the backs of pews to speak with one another . Their voices were low , as befitted the place , but they talked of weather and sickness and children and the state of the roads . " Awful dusty , ai n't it ? " George said . " We 'll get a shower before night , " his father told him , " and lay the dust . There 's thunder in the air all right . " " It 's a scorcher , that 's sure , " Ed agreed . Margaret beckoned to 011y . Not only her hat was pink but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you been over to see us , 011y Shaw ? I 've looked for you every night . We have a fine place over there now and you 'll say so when you see it . " " You look fine , 011y , " Mil said , smiling faintly over her restless baby 's head . " I guess that college down there agrees with you . " " Well , you do n't , Mil . You 're awfully white and your eyes look bad , " Margaret said , turning toward her . " It takes a while to get over some of these upsets that 's going around , I guess . " " What do you mean , Mil ? You been sick ? " " Did n't Ed tell you ? " " Tell me you were sick ? " " Why , I was flat on my back four days and Betty and Georgie had it too . There was n't anybody to do a thing but Esther , and Jen come up twice . I sent word by George to Ed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you could n't get away . " " Ed Shaw ! Ed ! Why in the world did n't you tell me Mil was sick ? I might have gone up just as well as not ! " " Say ! " Ed exclaimed . " You did mention that to me , did n't you , George ? " " Ed 's awful forgetful , " Jen interposed . " I always noticed that about him . It 's a wonder if he gets you half you send to market for . " " But in the case of sickness ! " Margaret said indignantly . " Look here , " Ed told her . " You married me for better or worse , and the Elder 's here to prove it . If174 AS THE EARTH TURNSmy memory 's worse you 'll have to put up with it , and no fussing , mind . Wo n't she , Mil ? " " It 's all right , anyway , " Mil said . " We 're coming along now . George got us something at the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've made up my mind it done the business , that pennyroyal , father , just the same ! " " There ai n't nothing better , " Mark Shaw said . " You want to keep it on hand . " " He always sticks up for his herb tea , " smiled Mrs. Shaw . " There , I do n't know . It may be as good as anything . " " Well , so you 're ' round again , 011y , " Doris Carpenter said , lingering near him , holding her flowered chiffon skirts against the breeze that came in at the open door . " Yes , I 'm back , " 011y answered . He added , " What 's new up Penny Brook way ? " Doris worked for her uncle in his general store at Penny Brook fourcorners , but came home on Sundays . For years she and 011y had recited history and geography , arithmetic and spelling together , the only two in their class . She was older than he , and looked it more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five years he had spent in school . Her face was hard and saucy from amusing the men and boys who came to her to trade and talk . Women rarely frequented a general store . " Nothing , " she said . " Dead as dishwater . I doubt if I stay there much longer . I want to get into a city where there 's something going on . Winters up there are terrible . It 's worse than here . " " Do n't tell me that . No place is dead where you are , Doris . " SUMMER 175011y himself was surprised to find how easily it came out . He had no way with girls . At college he stammered when he tried to talk with them , and though in his room he thought of light remarks like this to make , he never found a place for them . He thought it must be Doris was accountable , that withouttrying she put him at his best . He warmed toward her . " Do n't tell me that , Doris . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quickly and down again , flushing , trying to laugh . It turned her young and helpless . 011y rememberedwhat had been forgotten for years , the day she used his sled at recess without permission and broke the rope , and how he raged , and she stood crying . He felt a growing sense of power and mocking male gentleness . " I 'll tell you , " he said . " You 'd better come home often this summer . " " You think so ? " she asked him , trying to go halfway , but uncertain . The men and boys who came to trade did not look like this one . " Yes , I think so , " 011y answered definitely . " It is n't going to be so dead here  --  now I 'm home . " He did not know what he meant by that , nor where to lead the conversation next , and so he left her . Filled with a strange expansiveness he made his way through the group by the door , nodding here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handing his family into a long , shabby wagon . His mother and father looked swarthy and foreign , almost grimy , and the children were too fat , too beady-eyed , too many of an age to seem natural to Derwich , but176 AS THE EARTH TURNSStan was only golden brown as if from a bright , heavy tan , and his neatly clipped hair , his blue serge suit , his quiet manner were all as smooth as Oily 's . " Well , hullo , " he said , shaking hands . " You home for the summer ? " " For the haying , " Oily answered . " You riding down ? " Stan laughed . His teeth were big and white . " No , no room for me . I always walk anyway , when there 's time . " " Same here , " 011y said . He had never felt so thoroughly male . The sensation possessed him , made his voice for the minute heavier . " We 'll walk together . How 's to meet the family first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stan said . " One of Mr. Shaw 's sons . The girl who came over to the baby is his sister . " " T'at girl ? " Mrs. Janowski cried . " Oh , t'at girl she one angel straight from heaven . T'at girl , I bless her every day . Some time I see her out . She always wave her hand . T'at girl she lovely one . " The introductions continued . The chatter grew . Jen , near-by , came over to pass the time of day and was surrounded . Mark Shaw bowed and spoke to any who would listen of the forwardness of the season and the fullness of the corn . The Elder paused among these new members of his flock with special greeting . The Austins , Grants , and Walkers drew near curiously , making the Janowski family the center of a considerable , not unfriendly group . From this Stan and 011y emerged a little later , two serious young men , and walked away down the sandy road , talkingSUMMER 177at first of weather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read . From the church steps Doris Carpenter looked after them , unconsciously but busily arranging her short hair beneath her hat . NThe next day was hot and bright , as the Elder had requested . " Well , boy , " Mark Shaw said to John at breakfast , " we 've got to get at this haying , but we ca n't do a thing ' til the scythes is ground . " John went with him to the grindstone under the ash tree and sat on a chopping block to turn the handle . Mark Shaw straddled the end of the bench and poured water on the stone , then held the scythe against it with the heels of his hands until sparks flew off . It took both John 's arms to move the handle and when it stood straight up before him he threw his chest against it to make it go down . Mark Shaw paused and felt the blade with his fingers . He reached for the water can and cooled the stone again . " Well , that side 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing out white on John 's face . The stone moved slower and slower . " Now you go down and count the hens , " his father said . " Make sure they 're all in the yard . They take to laying out in this tall grass so now I ca n't be sure , and I do n't want any legs cut off this haying time . You speak to Bun as you go by and say she can turn for me this next scythe . " " I could , father , " John said , wiping his upper li AS THE EARTH TURNSwith the back of his hand . " I could turn for ' em all , could n't I , if you wanted me to ? " " Well , there ai n't no need , " his father said . " I guess Bun can do a little something to help us out . And you 're getting to be a fine counter . " Bun came importantly and turned the handle very fast , rocking on her seat . " I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bet he could n't turn for two scythes , not to save his life . I could , though . I could turn for all you 've got . I 'm awful strong . " " Yes , you 're fine and strong for your age , " Mark Shaw said , looking at her . " But you go easy now . Go easy . We 'll get just as fur . " And he added , feeling the blade , " Girls has to be careful . " " Girls has to be ! " Bun exclaimed hotly . " Girls has to be ! Girls are just as good as boys ! ! ... What do girls have to be careful for ? " As her father moved stiffly off his high seat , he said , " Well . You ask your mother . " And before she reached the steps , hurrying on her curious errand , he called , " Get your cats into the house and keep the screen doors fastened . I 'm going to trim out around the house and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , while 011y hoed the potato piece and Ed 's mowing machine knives clicked busily on Walnut Hill , Mark Shaw patiently and carefully cut wide rings around the rose bushes at the end of the house , the syringa , the thick-leafed yucca , the firebush , the peonies , and the long , fenced-in garden where the pansies and sweet peas and poppies grew . Mr. Hale , driving his cows by , said , " You got aSUMMER 179slow job there ! I never could see what there is to flowers worth all the trouble they be . " " Well , I do n't know , " Mark Shaw said mildly . " Womenfolks set store by ' em . " He worked on , since 011y was there to do the milking , until supper time . Jen could hear his rifle slapping the blade as she went into the cellar for the Training Day cookies she kept on the swing shelf in a big brown crock . He must be hot , she thought . It was a sweltering day . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very bottom of the well ; it was cold as ice down there . Five years ago Mark Shaw had lowered that well to thirty feet below the surface of the ground ; it was his boast now that the place would never be without water unless a greater drouth than he had ever seen came on the land . " I 'm fifty-two years old , " he sometimes said , " and in that time there 's never been no dry spell fit to reach that deep . Thirty feet and four inches down , it is . I guess we 'll have water here as long as we want it . " The next morning , as soon as the dew was off , he rode into the field behind old Bob , shorts bags padding the seat on his machine . The blades of the knives were thin-edged and shining , and as he rode along the sides and ends of the mowing he left broad swaths behind him , lying flat and wavy on the ground . The strip that still stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying grass filled the kitchen and all the upstairs rooms . Jen sniffed it as she made jam of the last of the strawberries . Bun and John waited , avid for 011y to have raked this hay and tumbled it into stacks of which one was always left18o AS THE EARTH TURNSfor the children to play on ever since the time when George and Ed had been children here . " Now that 's yours , " 011y said that night . " Do n't tear down the rest . " They ran , Bun squealing , and jumped into the midst of it . " Will you leave one for Esther to play on when you go to hay at George 's ? " Bun called after 011y as he walked away . " For Esther and Betty and Georgie and them to play on ? " " Oh , I suppose so , " 011y said . " ' Cause George never does . Betty said so . She said he never does . They ca n't do anything up there . They never have any fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They never have any fun . They never have any fun up there . " When 011y had gone John said , " What did you whisper ? What did Jen and you whisper in the sinkroom , that time ? " " When ? To-day ? " Bun asked , after a minute in which she chewed grass hungrily for the sweet drop at the end . " That time when you would n't let me in . I tried to open the door and Jen , she held it shut with her foot . I could see her through the crack holding it shut with her foot . " " Oh . . . Well , nothing , " Bun said , now staring at the sky . " Only father told me to ask ma , and she would n't say , so I asked Jen . " " Asked her what ? Asked Jen what ? " " Nothing , I told you , " screamed Bun . " Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . " She gave a great jump and landed on her stomachSUMMER 181on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at John with gentle scorn . " Only you need n't think , " she said , " I 'll tread any more loads of hay after this than you will , even though I could . Girls have to be careful . " One evening late in the week as Jen stood in the sinkroom washing the supper dishes , she bent forward until she could see Mil 's light shining far up the road . A late shower coming up and the men hustling to get in the last load of hay on Ed 's place had delayed the meal . She knew that George had gone home late , too , from his work at the Oakes 's and supposed that Mil was washing her dishes now . Mil had no sinkroom , and it was hot in her kitchen on a July night to bake and eat and clear away . George ought to build on a lean-to , Jen thought . " There goes George down the road lickety-cut , " said Mrs. Shaw . " He 's got the back seat full of young ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My , it 's getting so we 're just about the only ones do n't have a car to ride in . " Jen glanced again at Mil 's light , and as she looked , saw it go out . No other appeared , in the front room or upstairs . As she finished her work , she considered this . It was a lonely place up there at the edge of the woods for a woman to sit by herself in the dark . And by good rights Mil should be wrapping her butter now , for to-morrow was George 's market day . " I believe I 'll walk up the road a little ways , " she said , sponging her face and neck and arms with cool water and white soap . " The mosquitoes have kind of had their day now , so anybody can venture out once182 AS THE EARTH TURNSin a while . Do n't you look for me ' til I get back . There wo n't anything hurt me around here . " She went quietly on rubber-soled brown tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padded through the pale sand of the main road . The dust from George 's wheels still hung on the air and made her cough . She walked swiftly , fanning herself with her apron , past the pool her father always drove through on his way back from church to cool Bob 's legs and let him drink , and across the planks that bridged the brook . In the woods it was too dark for her to see as far as her feet , but she knew every step of the way , even the ruts and the slope of the ditches ; and in the clearing beyond she could distinguish the roof and chimney of George 's house as it set back in the field on the left . " Mil ! " she called into the black doorway . " Mil ! It 's Jen ! I 've come a-calling ! " There was no answer but she knew Mil must be about for the door stood wide open off the stone door rock . She felt her way inside , and called again cheerfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she heard Mil 's voice beyond the back window . " I 'm here , " it said . " Out here . " Jen pulled open the kitchen door and stepped into the fenced-in yard where Mil made the children play to keep them out of the reach of passing cars . The road past George 's place was the only one leading to Mount Passy , the highest point of land in the county , and many summer people used it , driving up from the beaches in the afternoon . SUMMER 183 " Well , cooling off ? " Jen asked . " This has been a hot one . " Mil sat on the seat of the chair swing that hung from the apple tree . Her dress lay open as if to nurse , though the baby was at some distance from her on the grass . " No , " Mil said , " I do n't ever expect to be cool again . I come out here to see if I could get my head together . I 'm just about at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the baby . " You 've got your hands full , " she agreed . " I do n't see how you manage as well as you do . " She had often said this to Mrs. Shaw and Lois May when they remarked on the length of Georgie 's fingernailsand the dingy streaks on Esther 's head and the way the house looked if anybody went in unexpected . " I guess we 'd have hard work to do any better than Mil , the way she 's fixed . " " It makes a great difference , " Mil said , " since Margaret went away . " Jen nodded . " Margaret always takes an interest wherever she is . " " It was n't only what she done to help , " Mil said . " It was just her being here to speak a word to .. . What would you folks think if I was to leave George , Jen ? " Jen played with the baby 's foot . " Why , I guess you would n't do that , Mil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what I 'm going to do , Jen . I would n't have said it to you like that if I had n't pretty well got my mind made up . . . . It is n't George so much . It 's pretty hard to work myself to death and never get any credit , and be shut up in that184 AS THE EARTH TURNSkitchen washing and digging and have him come home at night and only find fault because there 's no hot bread . He might help out a little instead of makingeverything so hard . . . . But it is n't George so much . It 's me . I 'm getting so I do n't have any patience . It seems as if I cry more than half my time , Jen . I ca n't even stand to let the children have their pleasure . And I ca n't eat my meals . When George sets there and stuffs himself at night I ca n't force down a mouthfuland I just sit and watch him and hate the way he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gobbles " " There , I know it , " Jen said easily . " He always had a great appetite . " " It is n't George so much , though , " Mil said again . " It 's me . I used to want so many things when I was growing up , and it do n't seem it 's right I should never have them . I used to want to go to school , off , I mean , and learn the way to do things nice . I used to like to look at pictures in the magazines , and I do now ; maybe it 's foolish ; but people wearing good clothes and laughing together , and women driving cars , and children in real bathing suits , and houses with piazzas and curtains at the windows . I want all them things , Jen . I 'm not like  --  some folks . " " I know it , Mil , " repeated Jen . " Like me now . I 'm just as contented where I am as ever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . Maybe if I was to think how I should feel if I had to live like Lize " " Oh , you 're lucky , " Mil said bitterly . " You 're as strong as a horse and some way you can always make things go as you want them to . " She left the swing and took up the baby as if she could not bear to seeSUMMER 185Jen 's firm , square hand so deftly quieting it . " Well , I will , too . I can get along some way in a city place and George 'll have to manage the best he can . Esther looks after Georgie as well as I do now . " " You 'd have to take the baby , " Jen said . " You could n't leave her here not weaned . " " Of course I 'd take the baby , " Mil exclaimed . She rocked the child in her arms . " And it 's so hot now , " said Jen . " That 's what makes it bad . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It would be a pity if your milk dried up . " " It 's coming rich and good now , too , " Mil said . " But still not too rich . She 's gaining on it fast . " " All of them gained on it , " Jen reminded her . " Ma said the other day she never knew a woman that fed so many babies all so well . " " No stronger than I am , " Mil said . She sat down beside Jen and gave the child her breast . " It 's just a miracle , " Jen said . " . . . Dear little young one . She knows her mother all right . " They sat on together quietly . " If you could only make out to stay ' til fall and wean her , " Jen said , " I 'd take her over with me when you 're ready to go , and then you could have her when you got settled in . " " Would you ? " Mil asked quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can count on that . " Mil felt for a handkerchief and not finding any , used the baby 's dress . " You 're awful good to me , Jen , " she said . " You and all George 's folks . That was one reason I wanted to speak with you . If I left George , I would n't want186 AS THE EARTH TURNS SUMMER 187eo think  --  I 'd lost all of you , not having any folks but Margaret of my own , and she married to Ed ; if Ed did n't want her to , I 'll bet she 'd never speak to me again . " " It 's funny to see them , " Jen laughed . " The way he likes to boss her around , and the way she is so tickled to have him . " " It 's all right as long as it lasts that way , " Mil said . " If only a woman do n't get tied hand and foot by children before she can see how things are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby for a long time . " Jen did not answer . " But as I say , " Mil was going on , " I wanted to know how you folks would feel about it  --  if I did . " " Well , we 'd feel awful bad , of course , " Jen said . " I guess it would hit father pretty hard . He 's one that thinks something of a man 's keeping his home together , all ways ; and he 's fond of you , Mil . You and Margaret both . I have means of telling . You 're just as near to him as his own daughters , and if you was to go off , he 'd have you on his mind , how you were getting on and if you needed anything . . . . But just the same he would n't hold you back from where you wanted to go , if you were sure you wanted to ; he 's never done that with any of them . . . No , Mil , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in the fall you 're bound to go . " She sprang up suddenly . " I hear George . I 'll cut down across the woods . Some time it might be just as well he never knew I was here to-night . " But by running she came out to the road at thebridge before he reached it and stopped him there . Mil could not see the halted headlights from her place , and she would not be listening to the motor as Margaretwould if it were Ed 's . " Well , hullo , Jen ! What are you doing on the road this time of night ? " " Just walking to get cool . The young ones with you ? " " Yeah . They 're all asleep . I got to talking down at the village there with Charlie Perry . He 's the first one of the selectmen I ever knew to  --  " " George , " Jen interrupted him . She stepped up on the running board and took his arm in her stout grip . " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing Mil . You 'll have to take my word for it , and do everything you can to make things pleasant for her , and so 'll all the rest of us . She 's stood an awful lot for years now , more than she was built for . It 's took it out of her . Do n't you tell her you saw me ; now mind what I say . Just you do what you can andI 'll do what I can , everything we can think of . We'veprobably got ' dl fall . " She disappeared into the dark and left George tostare after her , not sure how she meant he might losehis wife ; which was as she had intended . Men triedto ease the last hours even of a horse , unless they werenearer brutes than she knew George to be. v011y spent less and less of his evenings at home . During the day he worked steadily in the field with Ed and his father , and sat at table with the rest188 AS THE EARTH TURNSat supper . But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard and up the road , sometimes stopping at George 's for a minute or two , though not often , and hardly ever even glancing up as he passed the Hales ' house or the Austins ' . He had no friends in the neighborhood ; to the people here he had always been Mark 's odd one who never had a word to say when he met anybody on the road ; handy with books he might be , they supposed , but unhandy with tools . He knew of prophecies that had been made concerninghim , how he would never get far enough , for all his studying , but what he would be glad to come back some day to live on Ed ; and these he did not forget , though he was grown now and something of a stranger and all whom he met were polite . Two Saturday nights he called in for Doris Carpenter at the big unpainted house on the hill above Austins ' , but he was cool , and reserved , while he waited , for Bill Carpenter , Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn of all 011y attempted as a boy ; his noisy cordiality now made no impression ; 011y 's memory was long in these things . " Come out and see my bus , " Bill said . " I got a good buy . It may be an old model but it 's got an engine like a bird , and I 'm slapping on a coat of paint myself . . . Do n't look bad now , does she ? " " Looks all right to me , " 011y answered shortly . " I do n't know anything about cars . " He strolled back to sit on the steps , making a pile of broken grass between his feet , whistling softly , while Bill was left to explore alone the intricacies of his engine . It was not until 011y had Doris to himself , sitting under the willows by the brook , or leaning over theSUMMER 189railing of the bridge , or walking across cut fields , that he began to overlook the fact she was a Carpenter , sister of Bill , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She became just any girl , and he a man , not only a quick-witted , clever , and sophisticated person come down out of his mysterious world to her simple one , but a creature strong enough and ruthless enough to take his own way . This feeling raced in 011y , a slim boy in dark shirt and drilling trousers , whenever he saw Doris Carpenter , though if he made up his mind even to touch her he never quite reached the point of doing it . He was aware that she wondered why he did not , and even this amused him ; so assured was he ; he did not care what she thought or what she wanted ; this was no girl for him except as she roused him to a new experience ; back at college in the fall there would be others , girls who knew as much of Greek and poetry and astronomy as he did , younger , prettier , gentler girls than Doris Carpenter , girls not so easily won nor held , but possessed of all Doris had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love walking out like this , " sighed Doris . " Say , but that moon is swell . . . Like to hear that water running , 011y ? I do . " " Doris , " 011y said mockingly , " you must be one of those natural-born Lovers of Nature . " " Well , I sure have always had an eye for pretty things , " Doris answered with complacency . She took everything he said as a compliment , perhaps because she was accustomed to a far less subtle type of abuse than his . This trait sometimes made him feel almost tender toward her , but then she would laugh too loud or look up in the bold , provoking way190 AS THE EARTH TURNSthat , while it quickened his excitement , at the same time turned him cool with distaste and seemed to justify him in whatever he might choose to do . None of the Shaws , not even Jen , would have known him as he was with Doris Carpenter ; he hardly knew himself ; when he had left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , with everybody sleeping in the farmhouses that he passed , he puzzled over it . This , he supposed , was manhood . The only family he ever cared to see was the Janowskis . He walked down over the hill and across the road and into the Old Joe field nearly every night except Saturday . Sometimes he went around to the back of the barn where the cows and horse were kept , and helped Stan with his chores . It was always Stan who did the chores at night . Manuel played with his sisters in the brook , all of them splashing and duckingto wash off the mosquitoes , all naked , fat , dark little bodies running in and out among the bushes . Mr. and Mrs. Janowski sat on the bench before that end of the barn in which they lived . Sometimes 011y waited with them for Stan and listened to the long , broken , noisy stories they told of the old days in Poland where Stan had been born , and of later days in New York where Mr. Janowski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the cleaning and pressing and Stan had worked in an American factory that turned out many million yards of cotton cloth every single day ; and where all the younger children had been born , one after another in rapid succession because , as Mrs. Janowski said , laughing , " I eat so much wit ' nut'in ' to do but set all time , t'em kids fey just come ! " SUMMER 191 " Tat was t'e way to live , " Mr. Janowski said over and over , beating his hands on the edge of the bench . " Out t'ere wit ' my needle I could do good , get money . We see t'e pictures , eein t'at move , every week , do n't we , mama ? We take fern rides , high up . T'e kids , t'ey see t'e zoo and so . . . T'at was t'e way . " " What way ? " Stan would ask , coming out at last to sit with the others where it was cool , nodding at 011y . " T'e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T'e city way . T'is place you bring us to , you make such fuss , where we get to here ? Poland , t'is might be again . Yah-h-h ! " Later in the evening , as it grew dark , the Janowskis had their music . Every pleasant night the other Shaws heard it in the distance and smiled at one another . " They 're going it again ! " But 011y lay stretched on the grass to listen while Mr. Janowski played tunes on his cheap , creaking fiddle , and his and Mrs. Janowski 's heavy voices rollicked through big , blustering songs in their own tongue . He never tired of it , of seeing the way their bodies moved to keep the time , the man 's thin and jerky , the woman 's broad and swaying . Mrs. Janowski rolled her eyes and laughed as she sang . The children came from the brook , still wet and only half-dressed , and did as she did , copying every movement and giggling at the end . When they quarrelled they fought until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the elders sang on as if they noticed nothing , or as if any kind of sound was good . Often Stan sang . When he did , he became suddenly like the others , as unrestrained , as ribald , as Polish , but his voice was smoother and more flexible19a AS THE EARTH TURNSas even 011y could tell . When he took up the fiddle he handled it more gently than his father did and the bow brought out more delicate sounds ; the songs he played were slower , quieter , sweeter , but still wild and foreign to 011y 's ears . He tipped his face toward the sky and 011y could see how soft it became , merry and tender , almost childish . It seemed strange that a man could look so . 011y wondered what Ed would say if he should see Stan playing his fiddle . He did not quite like it himself , and yet he did not know why , and always stayed to listen as long as there was anything to hear . Long after the children were huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played and sang and his father and mother hummed a broad , rich accompaniment , rocking , while 011y lay with his head buried in his arms listening , feeling a half a world away from the Old Joe place ; and the other Shaws , going to bed or half rousing from sleep , chuckled indulgently , " And still they 're at it over there ! " But one night Jen was up when 011y came home . It was very warm and she sat by the open window , a lamp on the sill , knitting white yarn into a long strip . 011y slackened his pace as he crossed the yard , regarding her suspiciously . It might be she had heard about him and Doris Carpenter ; the greater wonder would be if she had not , in a busy-tongued place of this size . His resentment against Derwich , against Doris , against his own restlessness grumbled in him , fused into the one violent conviction that nobody had any business waiting up for him ; he was not married ; a fellow had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . SUMMER 193 " Been over to Ed 's ? " Jen asked cheerfully as he was washing . He had not gone into the kitchen where she was , but through to the sinkroom from the entry . " No , " said 011y . " I just thought you might have happened to , " Jen said . " It 's some time since I saw Margaret and I wondered how she was . I wish you would some evening , 011y . You see so much more than Ed does . He always says she 's all right , but . still I wonder if he knows . " " We 'll be haying up by the house beginning tomorrow , " 011y yielded . " I 'll see her then . " " That 's so , " Jen agreed , brightening . " So you will . " She smiled at 011y . He sat down tentatively on the end of the couch , watching her . " Still at it , are you ? ' he asked . " Do n't you ever stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard . " Of course , " Jen said . " I 'm through now . It is too hot to work on white and keep it neat , but I kind of thought it was time I got something started . It 's going to be a little blanket when it 's done . " She folded the strip , patted it , and stood up to lay it safely on the hanging shelf . As she sat down again , the spotted kitten climbed into her lap and paced back and forth there , purring , lapping both himself and her skirt . She stroked him . It did seem as if her hands were never idle ; she wished 011y could understand it was as she would have it . She lifted her chin and drew in her lower lip to blow out the lamp . " A lamp 's a hot thing , " she said. 011y did not answer . In the dark she could not tell whether he nodded . It did not matter . A lamp cer-194 AS THE EARTH TURNS SUMMER 195tainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in freely and cooled the room . The kitten snuggled down , his nose damp against her fingers . " You probably wonder where I have been , " 011y said . Sparks darted off the kitten 's fur as Jen ruffled it . " Well " " You think I 've been after a girl ! " " Why , I do n't , either , " Jen declared . " I do n't know who you 'd bother with around here ! You 're not the kind that goes skylarking anyway . It was George we used to worry so about . My , the nights mother and I stayed awake listening for George ! The trouble was for a while he kept taking up with the wrong kind . You ca n't tell what a scrape some girls will get a boy into , through no fault of his own , if he has anything to do with them . That 's the worst trouble with that kind . " 011y could see her , as she sat , side to the window , plainer than she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand imbedded in the kitten 's fur , were serene , even complacent . The simple honestyin her voice shamed him . " No , " Jen said . " What I thought , I thought you must be off walking alone these nights , maybe planningout speeches for some of them debates . And it seemed kind of too bad you could n't content yourself to get some rest after working hard all day . I got to thinking about it . I thought maybe  --  some way  --  we was n't making you very happy here at home , and I kind of wondered if we could n't , if only we just went about it right . " She sounded reasonable , willing , quietly eager . 011ycurled inside himself . Again she set him to wondering why she saw everything so straight , was so secure and capable , while he was always fighting back at life , hurting himself and those for whom he cared the most . It was not strange she could not understand him when he could not understand himself . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and about this house , as Jen and his father always had ; it was a pleasant enough place . " It is n't that , " he said awkwardly . " I 'll tell you . I go over to the Janowskis ' . " " Do you so ! " Jen exclaimed with interest . " Well , now , you go over there ! To the Janowskis ' ! " She seemed surprised , but neither relieved nor annoyed . Her face turned in 011y 's direction . " They 're quite a crowd , " he said . He liked talking to somebody about them , especially to Jen . It made them seem more real , less like a queer dream he had over and over . " They interest me . I have n't had much chance to get used to people of another race . Come to think of it , until now there 's never been anybody but Yankees around here , except the woodchoppers . That 's unusual . . . . You know , fen , I 've never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinaman nor a Jap ! " " My land ! " Jen said . " I 'm sure I never did either . I do n't know what they 've got to do with the Janowskis . " She wanted to hear what they talked about over there , what Mrs. Janowski cooked , if 011y knew . But she would ask no questions . Let him tell it as he pleased . " Well , they 're Polish , " 011y reminded her . He drew196 AS THE EARTH TURNSin his breath as if to say more , and then broke it off . " Yes , but I guess Polish is different , " Jen said comfortably . The Janowskis were the people who lived on the Old Joe place now . They ploughed and planted and drove past the end of the lane every day . Their baby had the croup and their children went to school with George 's and the Forrests and the rest . There was nothing in that to make anybody think of Chinamen and negroes and give himself the shivers. 011y lay leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His thoughts seemed to be clearing before him , arranging themselves in their proper places and proportions . It was nothing new . Jen had always done this for him , all unconsciously , whenever he stayed near her long enough . " They have their own ways , though , " he said . He chuckled . " It seems as if they 've never learned to hold themselves in , the way we do , and do n't see any need of it . Stan does mostly ; he 's that much more American than his folks , and more grown-up than the kids , butwish you could see the yard full of them scuffling over there at night , and the old folks singing for all they 're worth , and smell the air that comes out of their door when its open , a clean smell , you know , but strong and heavy . " " Must be something she cooks , " Jen suggested hopefully . " Stan can really sing though , " 011y told her . " And play that old fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . You do n't get to know him in a minute but there 's a whole lot there . I tell him he ought to start in now and go to college , but he ca n't see it that way . He'sSUMMER 197a farmer . The rest of them would pull up stakes and move anywhere , any time , like gypsies , but Stan 's a farmer . " " Yes , " Jen said . " That 's what father thinks . " " He 's a great fellow , " 011y repeated . " There 's a lot to him . " " Seems as if you might bring him over here some time , and let us hear him play and sing , " Jen said . " I 'm sure we 'd be pleased . " " Would you ? " 011y exclaimed , straightening . That was what he wanted . He knew it now . To bring Stan Janowski over here and let him play his crazy tunes in the Shaw yard with Mark Shaw and Jen and John to listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the window looking on . Stan 's music would not sound crazy here . Nothing ever had . It would sound good , and 011y could make his peace with it , and definitely accept Stan as his friend . " Would n't you really mind his being  --  Polish , Jen ? " " There , Polish ! " Jen exclaimed 011y laughed aloud with pleasure in her , and with relief . " Then I will ! " He stood up and stretched , elaboratelycareless , feeling the cool air creeping up his thin , bare arms and into his armpits . " Now I 'm turning in . " " You 'd better , " Jen agreed . " Anybody needs their sleep . " When he had gone she felt her way across to wind the clock , and softly lowered the windows that faced the southwest and might let in the damp of a night shower . " I do n't believe there 's a thing in what Ed was telling , " she thought . " That 's just some of Bill Car-198 AS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every fellow must be after Doris , being as she 's sister to him ! " Before she put the kitten out , she stood for a minute holding him pressed against her cheek . His fur was thick and soft , his little body rocked with his song . She did not intend ever to be without a kitten in the house . VIFourth of July morning George , on his way to the Oakes 's , left Esther and Betty and little George to spend the day with Bun and John . They had each a package of firecrackers , two boxes of torpedoes , and a box of sparklers . And as Betty had to carry them all while Esther guided Georgie 's stumbling bare feet , she staggered under the precious load coming up the lane . Bun ran to meet them , less from affection than to see the supply of fireworks increased ; her crackers were gone already , having been fired off under John 's window at daybreak . " Oh , say , John ! They 've got an awful lot . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ? " " No , sir , she never , " Betty declared . " S-she never bought ' em a-t-t-tall . My daddy bought ' em ! He took us down to the village with him , and he took mama too and we all went , but he went into the store his own self and got these for us . And he got mama something . He got mama a box of writing p-paper . Pink ! I wisht you could see it , Bun . It 's as p-pink as anything . Mama 's going to write me a 1-1-letter on it and send it right through the mail . She promised . " SUMMER 199 " Oh , Betty , " Esther said , " you keep still . What makes you always talk so much ? " Esther 's neck was spotted red . She had never seen her father give her mother anything before , and it did not seem as if it should be talked about . " Well , here you are , " Jen called from the shed-room door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'll know what day it is . You girls better all take off your shoes and stockings just like John and Georgie , and be comfortable . Be awful careful not to stay too near the firecrackers when they go off , that 's all ; and now you have a good time . " She went back to her ironing , pleased to hear a crowd scampering round the house , to start when an explosion came without warning , to see the yard littered with ragged red tissue stamped in strange gilt Chinese characters and the wisps of white that marked where torpedoes had been . At noon she would give them biscuit and butter and bowls of new green peas and big molasses cookies and let them eat where the birds would clear away the crumbs . Children were no trouble to her ; two or five or an even dozen , it was all the same . At noon , when Ed rode by from mowing George 's high ground , Mil sat beside him on the wagon seat . She waved her hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken her a note from Margaret . " Mil , dear , Ed said Jen told him when he came back from putting the milk on the train this morning that the children were coming down there to spend the Fourth . If they are , why ca n't you come for dinner and stay the afternoon with me ? You can . Now come along . Every time I 've asked you you 've made someZoo AS THE EARTH TURNSexcuse ; and I think it 's a disgrace you have n't been inside my house once yet . Now if you do n't come to-day , I sha n't like it . You bring the baby and if you 've got any sewing , I can help you . I 'm going to have a good dinner ready , and I know you would n't want me to go to trouble for nothing . You telephone up to Oakes 's and tell George to stop here for you on his way home to-night . Now you come . Margaret . " The baby lay asleep across Mil 's knees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bonnet , gifts from Lize at Christmas time . Ed 's horse ambled gently along the clay road from cleared field to cleared field with stretches in between where the alders and birches closed in until they nearly blotted out the sky . Ed spoke to Mil politely of weather and crops and pointed out ripening berries with his whip . He said he was having a telephone put in ; the linemen were setting posts as they rode past . Mil felt secure and cool , confident that she looked her best in a green linene dress Margaret had made for her in the spring ; she laughed at Ed for keeping the horse so fat and asked if he fed her on butter . Years before she had teased George like this ; when she had been a girl people said Mil Ross was a great one for going on . It was strange how anybody let down and kind of gave up as she grew older . Margaret came running out . " Well , Mil , you did come ! Oh , I 'm glad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Anybody that can go other places can go to see her sister . What 's all this I hear about you and George gallivanting down to the village last night and sitting round talking ' til all hours , I should like to know ! " SUMMER 201 " Gracious , " Mil exclaimed , flushing , " we just went down to get the young ones some fireworks " Ice cream cones , too ! You all had ice cream cones ! ... Oh , I keep tabs on you ! " Margaret took the baby on one arm and led Mil with the other hand . Mil must see the house . She must get the view from the new roof windows , feel the mat of the overstuffed living-room set , see the linoleum in the kitchen , notice how high-posted the cellar was , how the piazza shaded the front room , in what good light the pictures hung . When they finally reached the dining-room , the table was laid with a red-andwhitechecked cloth and the gilt-rimmed china , and Margaret in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new peas ; plum sauce and cocoanut cake waited on the sideboard , and lemonadewith ice and mint in it ; Mil could see the green springs floating through the glass of the pitcher she had given to Margaret on the day of her marriage . " Well , what do you think of the ranch , Mil ? " Ed demanded . He pulled out her chair and pushed her into it and shoved her up against the table so close she could scarcely breathe . It was his way of showing his affection . " Is it good enough for your little sister ? " " As far as I can see , it 's good enough for any woman living , " Mil said . " But do n't you get rough here , or I 'll box your ears . I have before now and I meant it too . The way you used to chase Margaret when she was little ! Until she 'd screech and cry ! " " I guess you did n't box ' em hard enough , " Ed grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peg ? I 'm at it yet . " " I should think you were , " Margaret scolded him. 202 AS THE EARTH TURNS " Now haying 's begun I hardly ever get a glimpse of him , Mil . " When Ed had gone , riding on his mowing machine , to finish cutting the grass on George 's hill piece , Mil and Margaret sat by themselves on the porch , the house neat behind them , the fields patched green and yellow before , the baby playing on a shawl at their feet . " Have you heard about 011y taking up some with Doris Carpenter ? " Mil asked , dipping at once into the sweetness of whispering and nodding with another woman . " Bill 's had a lot to say about it to Ed , " Margaret answered . " I do n't believe it amounts to anything . " " I 'm sure I hope not , but he 'd better be careful , " Mil said darkly . They had brought out lemonade in tall glasses and she sipped hers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there to Penny Brook . I only hope she ai n't too smart for him . " " They have to be pretty smart to get ahead of 011y , " Margaret said . 011y had been the big boy in her school the first year she taught , and she still looked upon him as a favorite . " How are the children ? " she asked Mil . " It seems so long since I saw them . " " You ought to come up , " Mil said . " I do n't see what you have to tie you ... Oh , they 're all right , only Georgie 's had the pink eye awful bad . The girls miss going to school . They 'll be glad when it begins again , but I hate to send them to anybody but you . I think you 're foolish not to keep your school , Marg . It 's too bad to lose the chance to earn a little somethingof your own to do with . " " Well  --  Ed never liked my teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard for me to keep the two jobs going . " " Two ! " Mil exclaimed . " Most women handle a dozen ! No , it 's independence men wo n't have in women ; they do n't care about the jobs as long as they 're at home where nobody else can see them . " " What talk ! " Margaret said , wagging her finger . " I wo n't have it . It 's a wife 's business to be loyal ! " " Another job , " Mil said grimly . But after a minute in which she stared at the baby she finished with , " No , but I do wonder who they 'll get to take the school . First thing I know , Betty 'll be trying to act just like her , whoever she is . Betty 's the greatest little mimic . " " Oh , I know it , " Margaret said . " She was the best actress I had in the whole school . Esther is so dependablethough . I never saw a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I would a woman almost anywhere . " " She 's a good hand with Georgie all right , " her mother granted . " But then Georgie is an easy young one to get along with , Margaret . He 's got far the best disposition of them all " They talked on , rocking , of the children and the school and the neighbors , of sealing wax and cleaning powders and pudding recipes , of prices in the cataloguesand stories in the magazines and the costs of upkeep on a car . Between them they finished the baby 's first pair of rompers , made of stout blue cloth with a pink rabbit appliqueed on the front . They tried it on her and found it fitted , and Margaret kissed and cuddled her and carried her over her shoulder into the garden , where Mil picked sweet peas and pansies to take home. zoo AS THE EARTH TURNS " I mean to have a garden of my own some time , " she said , " but some way I never get to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , Mil , " said Margaret . She kissed the baby 's neck and felt its soft arms and legs through the thin romper . " You 'd think they were a garden if you had them , " Mil said , smiling indulgently . " Margaret , these hollyhockswill be budding before long . And what a bed of asters you 'll have here ! " Margaret was not thinking of hollyhocks nor of asters . She would keep her children as clean every hour of the day as little Vera was now , and never let their skin get chafed nor their hair dusty . She would teach them to like people , and to smile , and to wave good-by to Ed , and to say their names and where they lived very early . " Here comes George , " Mil exclaimed . " Wherever has the day gone to ? " " Where 's Ed ? " George asked , setting his brake with a flourish . " Get your stuff together and pile in . Jen wants everybody over there for supper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wondered if she would n't , maybe . I think I 'll take over the rest of my cocoanut cake . " They packed Mil 's sewing and the baby 's things . Ed came from the barn with brimming pails and Margarethurried to strain the milk and set it in the cellar . George took the baby while Mil climbed into the back seat of the car , not looking at either of them as he did so , but saving the strain on Mil 's back , however ungraciously . SUMMER 205 " What about our milking , George ? " she asked him in an undertone . " Oh , do n't you worry about that , " he told her . " You 're always worrying . " " Not to-day , " she said quickly . " Not to-day , I 'm not . I just spoke of it . " Margaret came in beside her , and the men swung into the front seat , drawing their legs after them . George lit his pipe and the good smell of mild tobacco drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove very fast for such a rough road ; the lurches made Mil and Margaret tumble against each other . Ed called back , " You still with us ? " The yard of the old place was full of children when they drove in . Red and white tissue still dotted the grass . The odor of slow matches hung about the steps . " Hullo , " Jen called from the shed-room . " You go right into the kitchen . It 's nice and cool there and we 're all ready to eat . " They sat around the table and helped themselves from platters heaped with crusty fried fresh fish , potatoes in their skins , pork gravy thickened with flour , peas left over from dinner , big hot biscuit , and cold johnnycake with sugar on it and thick yellow cream jen had skimmed from her last night 's pans . " Have some more , Ed ; you 've got to keep up with George , or nobody will . " " Hey , hey , what 's that ? " " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . Have another piece of fish . " " Thanks , I will . " George was proud of his appetite . Mrs. Shaw held the baby . " You do n't need to toost her , ma . " Jen filled the children 's plates and brought in more food from the kitchen , tousled the boys ' hair , and made Mil206 AS THE EARTH TURNStaste her jam . It was not plain when she ate herself , yet her helpings disappeared and she never hurried . It was as it had been on other Fourth of Julys . Mark Shaw , bent over his plate , could see out of the corner of either eye a circular row of young and older ones reaching around the table as far as his wife . At one time her face blurred because of the sun but then Jen rose and pulled down a shade . Now he could see them clearly , fourteen of them , safe and well , eating his food . Their voices reached him , their jokes and laughing , but he did not listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here ; he thought of Lize and Lois May , and Ralph . When the meal was over and the dishes were finished , the women followed the men and children into the yard . They sat on steps and chairs and sawhorsesfrom the shed , and the children lit sparklers and set them in the grass or ran about waving them above their heads , making fiery scrolls on the dark . " The potato bugs are an awful pest this year , " Ed said . His father told him , " We 've paris greened ours twice already here . " Margaret laid her arm across Jen 's knee . " Mil liked my garden , ma . I do n't know what she 'd say to yours . " Mrs. Shaw bridled . " Well , I do n't know . I wish you 'd come down and spend a day with us , Mil , and see if there 's anything you like . We could let you have some roots . " Mil laughed . " I guess I 'll have to stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his foot impatiently . " I do n't know where she gets the idea she has to stick in the house . I could bring her down here any morning . " Ed lounged on the step and felt for Margaret 's hand . 011y came upSUMMER 207the lane and into the yard with Stan Janowski . " Why , 011y ! " Jen exclaimed . " I did n't even know you 'd left . Hello , Stan . Ed , get Stan a chair . " Stan said in his slow , even voice , " I 'll just sit here . " Mark Shaw asked him , " Bugs into your potatoes much over there ? " Bun came running , her steps as heavy as a young colt 's . " I made my initials . Did you see me make my initials on the air ? " 011y said low to Stan as they lay together under the tree , " You know they 're getting up an ice cream supper up at the church . You going ? " Stan supposedhe would . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a great place for a feed . " Stan glanced at 011y sidewise . " Not taking your girl ? " 011y laughed . " I should say not . 1 ' 11 bet that girl would eat so much I 'd have to pay double for her . She looks like a big appetite . " He added , tearing up grass by the roots , " I do n't see her often now anyway . Looked like she was taking it too much to heart . You know how they will . " Stan said he did not know ; he was no heart-breaker . " Did you bring your violin , Mr. Janowski ? " Margaret asked . " The children have told me you play . " 011y answered for Stan , " His father 's using it to-night . " As he spoke , they could all hear the faint strains of Mr. Janowski 's music under the hill . Mil rocked comfortably . The last sparkler flickered out . " Well , " Mark Shaw said , lookingup through the leaves at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . The lightning will give us all the fireworks we 'll get ' til a year from now . " Margaret leaned against Ed . " Oh , I dread the thunder showers . " Mark Shaw 's head turned toward her . " Why , no , " he said gently . " You do n't want to dread them . They 're a real pretty sight . " 208 AS THE EARTH TURNS viaMrs . Hale , as president of the Ladies ' Aid , appointed committees to take charge of the ice cream supper . She stood up in church after the service was over and the Elder had made his rounds , and read off the names she had written on a paper . A painted silk fan beat rhythmically against the breast of her black silk coat as she read , and the pulse in her throat moved in and out the black velvet ribbon that bound it . " Solicitor , the president . Collector , Agnes Austin . Supper committee  --  Jennie Shaw ; that 's the beans and like that , Jennie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be sold separate , you see . Kitchen committee , Minnie Grant . Flower committee , Cora Shaw . Entertainment committee , Margaret Shaw . " She folded the paper with one hand and lifted her chin higher to finish . " The committees will feel free to call on them not named to do what will be needed . The money , you remember , is to be used toward the fund for shingling the church . We have thirty-one dollars on hand at present counting , and if the love of the Lord and all His works is in us , we should make up the needed sum this summer . " She sat down , breathing hard . " Amen , " said the Elder softly . " Amen , sister Hale . " " You did good , " whispered Bun across the aisle , smiling beatifically . " You did lovely , Mrs. Hale . I could hear every word . " That was what people said to her when she spoke in public . The corn grew tall and kept as fragile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The potatoes blossomed and the first cucumbers set on and the high-bush berries ripened in the swamps , ready for canning . Mr. Robinson , the fish man , bought huckleberriesfor twelve cents a quart and raspberries for fifteen , and paid twenty-two cents a pound for all the broilers Jen would dress and sell . It was as busy a time as any in the year , and nothing kept the men from their work in the fields except the dark , but the women washed and ironed and cleaned and baked and picked and canned and watered and nursed , and even raked after when sudden showers were coming up , and still somehow found time to cook extra and fancy food , to scour their silver and the washboiler in which the coffee would be made , to teach the childrenverses , and to decorate the meeting house and grounds with evergreen and crepe paper . They were the Ladies ' Aid . Of the men , only 011y made a contribution . Margaretasked him to give a speech for the conclusion of her program , to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to shorten the time he spent in the fields to be considering topics , rejecting , choosing , organizing , and working out figures of speech . Mark Shaw watched him turning hay with a freer , easier motion of his fork , and thought the boy had learned the use of tools at last , but it was only that he was twirling words and phrases so lightly in his mind that even his arms and hands responded . " I 'll tell them , " he thought , " what a good thing it is for everybody to find the place where he belongs ; how we ought not to expect one place to fit us all . " At night , hot as it was , he sat in his room and pored2Io AS THE EARTH TURNSover the outline he had made . Sweat running down his face from his forehead , he looked through his own books for suggestions ; and he looked through several volumes which had been his mother 's , flowery bindings with thin , finely-printed pages , and scattered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Derwich Democrat which told how Miss Eliza Shaw of Rumfret had spent Christmas with her father , Mr. John Shaw and family , of Branch Road ; how Edward Shaw , son of Mr. John Shaw of Branch Road , was recovering from a two months ' sickness with lung fever ; how Mrs. John Shaw of Branch Road passed away at her home , aged thirty-nine years and three months , a great loss to the community where her kind words and pleasant smile had endeared her to her neighbors . Jen must have put the clippings here for safe keeping . 011y smiled to himself . He had a different use for books than Jen 's , or his mother 's , or even Margaret 's . He was a lone wolf in this family . " I 'll tell them , " he thought grimly , " as parents , to look for individuals among their children . " And he wrote down , " Individ . Diff. , " in his outline . The afternoon before the church supper the last hay from the Mark Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only George 's low ground to be cut . Old Bob and Ed 's horse drew the loads , five of them ; Ed pitched on , Mark Shaw laid the hay smooth on the cart , and 011y raked after . Their black shirts and blue overalls and sneaker shoes , the only clothes they wore , except their broad , coarse straw hats , clung wet to their skins . When the fifth load reached the barn , Ed unhitched Tommy and drove home to his own place , leaving his father to pitch off and 011y to takeSUMMER 2IIaway . " Here she comes ! " Mark Shaw said , hurling up a great forkful . After that he did not speak , but the hay came with perfect regularity like the waves of the sea , and 011y snatched and tore at it , cobwebs swingingfrom the beams behind his head , the air stifling with dust . He would not make his father stand with fork poised , or lower it unemptied once it had been raised . He could take away what any man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaw said . " You 'd better come out through the shed , 011y . We 've built this up so you could n't reach the ladder . " He let himself down from the cart to the barn floor and walked to the door , wiping his face on his handkerchief . As he looked out over his fields , he saw them all cut ; the grass was dried , and hauled in , and put away for winter with hardly a drop of water ever having touched it . He sat down on the jutting stone of the foundation and stared straight before him , his eyes proud and content . At last he turned his head. " 011y ! You out of there ? " " Coming , " 011y said . He had lain for ten minutes in the narrow space next to the roof , writhing with cramps , but now managed to get through the door to the shedchamber . A little later his father heard him pouring water into a zinc tub . The shedchamber was the summer bathhouse . VIIIIn the little vestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , round tin cans of brown bread212 AS THE EARTH TURNSstill hot from the stoves of the women who had steamed it , potato and onion salad and lettuce leaves wrapped in damp cloths , cans of spicy pickles , and custard pie , blueberry pie , lemon , cream , and dried apple pie ; and she kept a fire over which to make the coffee . On the opposite side of the room Mabel Forrestcut the cakes , the fruited cake , the chocolate cake , the angel cake , the cakes with marble frosting and those with nuts on top ; and she told Mr. Hale and Agnes Austin where to put the ice cream freezers when they brought them in . There was vanilla , lemon , and banana ice cream , and Margaret had sent a chocolate sauce with hers . " They had it that way up to Boston , " Jen explained . " Sauce on the ice cream . According to their tell , it 's very good . " Agnes Austin , who had brought the lemon , wished she had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good recipe for lemon sauce . Outside the children ran and whooped among the tables and benches set about the yard , all except Manuel Janowski who was upstairs reciting his piece once more to Margaret ; his big voice boomed down through the register in the ceiling of the vestry . Mrs. Janowski , leaning against the sink , ready in a white all-over apron to wash any dishes that might be brought to her , listened in rapt satisfaction . He had a fine voice , Manny did . Mrs. Shaw sat on the stairs leadingup to the church , making buttonhole bouquets of pansies , lilies of the valley , and one zinnia for each , and thinking Margaret must be deafened by this time . She said as much to Mil , who was helping with the flowers , and Mil smiled and shrugged her shoulders . Mrs. Hale hurried from one to another , indoors and out , upstairs and down , considering this , explainingSUMMER 213that . Her small old face worked with eagerness and elation . She was the president . The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been president for twenty years continually . She knew what should be done , and who should do it , and the church would be shingled by fall ; the love of the Lord and all his works was in her ; and her skirts rustled busily through the doorways of his house . " My , " Jen whispered admiringly to Mabel Forrest , " do n't the years rest light on Mrs. Hale ? She 's never changed a mite since I can remember . " " She 's never changed a mite since she married Aaron , " Mabel answered . " Always up and going it , any place like this . She started Ladies ' Aid , you know . " " Yes , " Jen said respectfully . " She 's a religious woman . " Jen put wood on the fire and began dipping beans into the thick white vestry dishes with a blue enamel spoon . Her own beans were rich with slitted lumps of sweet salt pork and ruddy with mustard and molasses and long cooking , but Mil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar ; some liked them one way , and some another . Men 's voices sounded about the yard . The children lingered at the door and sniffed . The sun was going down . Jen dipped faster and faster , her face pink with pleasure and excitement . By the time she had filled a bowl for each table , and sliced the brownbread , and turned out potfuls of the coffee , Mil and Margaret and Doris Carpenter and the two Grant girls , who waited on the tables , were back for more beans . Jen attended to them again and again , and all she saw of the supper was a glimpse now and then , as she passed the door , of men and children eating2r4 AS THE EARTH TURNSheartily and laughing , sitting at long , heaped tables in the twilight . She ate only a taste now and then , as the other women did , a spoonful of Mil 's beans , a crumb of Mrs. Hale 's angel cake , a bit of Margaret 's sauce caught before it dripped off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Mr. Hale wants another plateful of your beans , Jen . He says that 's all he ever comes to a church supper for , to get some of Jen Shaw 's beans . " " Well , they 're all gone , but you tell him to try some of my custard pie . It 's just as good as my beans , you tell him . " The supper over , orders began to come in for ice cream and cake . Doris held the lamp by which Mabel Forrest looked down into the freezers and chose vanilla , or lemon , or banana . Jen 's fingers grew numb with packing and unpacking cracked ice . Mrs. Janowskiattacked a mountain of dishes , humming as she worked , her huge body filling the alcove where the sink stood until nobody could find room to help her . " You go ' long , " she laughed . " Oh , I do t'at . Oh , sure . T'at ai n't nut'in ' . " All the ice cream was bought and paid for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , and a crowd of young men and boys had come down from Penny Brook way with big appetites and with Saturdaynight wages in their pockets . By the time every one had finished it was black dark , and the women had to feel over the tables for the dishes ; two of Mrs. Hale 's teaspoons were not found . They might have fallen on the grass or been carried away as a joke by the Penny Brook boys who , as everybody knew , had no idea of manners , but Mrs. Hale held her headSUMMER 215high and said it did not matter ; she had twenty-four dollars and seventy cents in the plate she had passed among the tables , a better sum than she had expected . Now they must go to hear the speaking , all of them , for it was fitting ; they could finish the work in the vestry later on . Mrs. Hale went up the stairway first and the others followed , except Margaret who had gone long before to prepare the children . Mrs. Janowskicreakingly brought up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiling a proud , broad , dark smile . They sat in two rows at the back , the Ladies ' Aid . " They 've fixed it up nice , ai n't they ? " Agnes Austin whispered . Margaret heard her as she twined Betty 's shoulders with a chain of ox-eyed daisies , behind a sheet hung across the front of the platform as a curtain , and worked yet more carefully . The church did look pretty with the flowers and evergreen and braided crepe paper . Now if the children would remember their poetry and not be frightened and if they would bow low enough so that the bow would show  --  then if she should be kept from taking charge of the next concertin the parish , people might speak of this and say how good it was . She gave a daisy chain to Esther and one to Bun and one to Kathie Forrest ; they were to sing the welcome song together . " Now , I 'll play for you . You sing good and loud , wo n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . . . " Margaret stepped out between the curtains and down from the platform . The Penny Brook boys applaudedher . She flushed and tried to hide herself be-216 AS THE EARTH TURNShind the organ , though she thought she did look rather well . She was surprisingly healthy , and kept her color , and her eyes looked bright . Her wedding dress was still as crisp and snowy as before it had ever been washed , and the cape collar ruffled softly over her bare arms , but she could not wear it again after this ; at least not for months . She should not pump the organ , either , she supposed , but just this once it would not matter . She wondered if Ed , slouching in a dark corner , was looking at her , if he was proud he had married her , what he would say if he knew what she knew ; it was beginning to frighten her that she had not told him yet ; sometimes she even thought he guessed it . Her hands touched the cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've come " She heard the curtain swishing back and the footstepsof the children , even their breathlessness . " De-ear friends " All the children were joining in bravely . Everything was begun . Manuel would come next , and he had known his piece an hour ago . " Gee , I was scared , " Bun told Esther as they scuttled off the platform . " Were n't you scared ? Gee , I 'm alwaysscared . " The other children clapped , and the fathers of the children , and the Ladies ' Aid and the boys from Penny Brook way . There were not many entertainments to be enjoyed ; the audience was not critical . The doors and windows stood open and the air felt cool ; outside in the dark the fields had been cut and the second crop was growing ; in places corn was setting on . Harvest would soon be here and crops promised to be good as well as early . They all clapped until theirSUMMER 217hands stung , and settled back to await what would come next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was born in her ; Sarah Louise and old Hattie Lord had been just the same . Manuel recited " Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree " with only one prompting . Betty Shaw danced the " Summer Wind " to a sprightly tune that Margaret played , and as far as Margaret could tell nobody objectedeven if it was in the church , Betty 's slim body and small feet and the yellow curls that Mil had made of naturally straight hair blew so lightly about the place where the pulpit usually stood ; it could not be wrong , for the Lord Himself made dandelions and turned them into balls of fuzz . Norma Austin and her little brother did a dialogue . Bun spoke a long poem with bombast and great good humor . John followed her without warning and stood , and bowed , and solemnlyspoke the same piece as perfectly as she had . " Why , nobody ever taught it to him ! " his mother gasped . He went back to her and she held him close . Mark Shaw 's eyes dwelt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high sweet voice , and Betty pirouetted in to join her in the chorus with many airs and graces . Then the fourth Shaw boy went down the aisle . It had been announced that he would talk to-night on what he had learned at college about the new ways of education . Reading and writing and arithmetic were not enough these days , it seemed ; new-fangled ideas about the schools were going around . The women bent forward . He was a fine-appearing boy in his dark suit with the trousers creased and his white shirt and neat-fitting collar ; he seemed used to his218 AS THE EARTH TURNSclothes , too , and everything about him was very clean . Nobody could say that he was handsome ; he took after his mother , and all the Footes had big noses and long , narrow heads , but he had their smart look and a way of his own . The men observed him curiously ; this was Mark 's odd one . " My sisters think , " said 011y evenly , " that you would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young children , not the simple differences in height and weight , but the differences in intelligence , character , disposition and special gifts . It is a mistake to believe that any child can be made as ambitious as any other child , or as honorable , or as brilliant . Parents are given certain materials , and their part must be to make of these materials the most and best that can be made of them ; you can not do more , you must not do less . " He spoke clearly , easily , and forcefully . Though he held himself rigidly within bounds , it was plain that emotion colored much of his thought . He was too young , too intense yet to keep it out altogether ; the problems of the world seemed too vital to him , not only mathematical formulae . He knew this and crooked his lip , but eagerness still flooded his voice ; and if it had not , the audience would have ceased to listen ; none of his cold-blooded professors could have kept the Derwich farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay day and an ice cream supper . " It is important , " 011y said in concluding , " to look into your children , to recognize and use the differences among them , not to try to make them all the same , all like the one that happens to give you the most per-SUMMER 219sonal satisfaction . Parents should realize that children are not children long , but individuals always . And when they do grow up , do n't hold them back . Help them to understand themselves , and then let them go in whatever direction they choose ; even if it seems the wrong direction it is too late to teach them , then , and they must find it out ... " 011y glanced at the floor and up , half-smiling . " That is one good thing , " he said , " I grew up with  --  not the only one . But at our house , nobody is held back . . . And if the stuff is in us , we shall prove some day that  --  Mark Shaw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this . The next instant , as he turned to leave the platform , he was wishing bitterly that he had not said it . The personal had no place in a public speech ; moreover the Shaws did not speak even in private of such things . But people said he was more Foote than Shaw . Perhaps it was the Foote in him that had seen his father standing alone on the edge of the meeting , a silent man , well thought of but little known , and remembered the kind , puzzled , patient face with which he had watched four of his children go into a world he did not understand . For Mark Shaw the country outside of Derwich was shut off by hills he could never see over , and the language there was one he could not use ; unless the children were at home they were " away , " and more than that , switchboards , airports , colleges , bosses , salaries , courses , he could not grasp ; thinking of it bewilderedhim . But he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Foote , had suddenly felt obliged to say so . It was something no Shaw would have done . He slid almost miserably into his seat. 220 AS THE EARTH TURNS " That was great , " Bun told him , seizing him around the neck from the back . " I could hear every word . " " Why , it was fine , 011y , " Mil said . She was wiping her eyes unashamedly . " I declare , I 'd never have guessed that you could speak so . Shows how little we know our own , do n't it , ma ? " " There , I should say , " Mrs. Shaw answered admiringly . " I bet he has done a world of good by that talk . " " Oily , " Margaret said , touching his arm , " I  --  I ca n't tell you how splendid that was . And what you said about father ! . . . I 'm so glad you did , 011y . " He realized then that they had honestly liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole family was touched and proud , even George and Ed , grinning over their wives ' heads , but still he could not meet his father 's eyes . The little group broke away from him to let the neighbors in . " They 're making quite a piece of work over you all of a sudden , 011y , " Mabel Forrest said in her hearty voice , " but I always knew you 'd ' mount to something from the time you was a little whoppet . " Even two of the Penny Brook boys shook hands with him , hastily , sheepishly , withoutspeaking , as if they did not want to do it , but would not like to think that they had not . " That was a good talk , " Aaron Hale said . He had once told 011y he drove a horse the poorest of any twelve-year-old boy he had ever seen , but that opinion did not deter him now . " Good talk as ever I heard . " And Mrs. Janowski with the tears still streaming down her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear t'at . He t'ink our kids t'ey never care what a lot we do . I sure am proud my kids t'ey see you . Kids , t'ey need somebodySUMMER 221to look up to , I always tell . " For the minute 011y stood on a pinnacle , but he was well aware how short a time he would stay , let him but start to mow a field at George 's place , or even to build a yard for Jen 's chickens . He knew that each profession remembers its own heroes and forgets the rest ; here the need was for straight rows and swaths and truly driven nails , skillfulmuscles , a weather eye and a patient spirit ; this kingdom was Ed 's . Some other , if any , must be his . The women drifted back into the vestry . " Well , Jen , I guess you 're proud to-night , " Agnes Austin said . " You 've got reason to be . " " Yes , " said fen , her dish towel flying , " it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant 011y , " Agnes said . " How he 's changing ! I do n't doubt he 'll be a great man some day . And the way he spoke about your father . It ai n't many young men has such respect .

Come ! You ' most ready ? Father wants to get started home . " " Goodness , no , " Jen answered . " We 're nowheres near through here . You tell father to take the rest of you and go along . I 'll come when I can . " " Ai n't you scared to go alone at night ? " Agnes Austin asked . " Goodness , no , " said Jen again . " What would I be scared of ? And anyway , 011y 's somewheres around . He 's walking too . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EARTH TURNSUpstairs 011y helped Margaret to take down the curtains and put up the pulpit and carry away a litter of paper and daisies and cheesecloth . Margaret wished Ed were as thoughtful as 011y , as deft with little jobs , as attentive and appreciative . Now that it was all over she felt tired and heavy , all she wanted was to get home as soon as possible and take off the tight dress . It seemed like hours that she sat in the wagon , while 011y looked for Ed among the groups of men standingtalking and smoking about the yard ; she tried to curl up on the seat but it was hard and her feet felt swollen in her shoes . She even envied Mil when she heard her climbing into the car and George 's voice saying gruffly , " You done enough before . Let the rest of them clean up . " But when Ed came he was tall and broad and swung himself in beside her carelessly . His shoulder felt and smelled familiar , and a little way down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think to suggest her doing so , he would ease himself back to make her comfortable . Ed was her man . " Good night , 011y , " she said . " And thank you . " 011y was a dear boy , she thought , and forgot him . With skill Ed guided his horse through the crowd and along the edge of a steep bank , Margaret clinging to his arm. 011y became suddenly aware of someone beside him in the streaked dark and knew without looking down who it must be . " I guess you 're in awful demand here to-night . Poor little me , I do n't get as much as a look from you . Anybody'dthink we did n't know each other ! " " Well , we do n't , do we ? " SUMMER 223 " Why , Oliver Shaw ! " " I mean , " 011y explained , with an effort , " a fellow could n't get to know you in the little I 've seen of you , Doris . You 're too deep , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So that 's what you think , is it ? " Suddenly she slid her hand into his pocket beside his . He could feel the long , pointed nails and the grate of the multitudinous thread-like creases that covered her palm . It set his teeth on edge . He knew now why he had never touched her of his own accord ; she was not really clean , although she looked so . Not only this discovery annoyed him , but the consciousness that her eyes had clung to him all during supper and the evening , begging him to acknowledge her before the neighbors . " I 'm not so deep , " she was saying . " Honest , I 'm pretty nice ... If you 're going to take me home , let 's start . The sooner we leave , the longer we 'll have on the way , you know . Ever hear that before ? " She pressed her chin hard against his arm , and then he felt her look up . " Did you ever , 011y ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think about you . Stan Janowski 's waiting somewhere for me to go down with him . We came together . " " Stan Janowski ! ... You can just tell him , 011y . Tell him you 've got to take your girl home . " " Look here , 1 -- -2 ' " ' Cause you have , 011y . I 'm all alone . Bill 's gone long ago . I 'd be scared to death up through the pines . Honest I would . " " All right , " 011y gave in . " Come along then . " 224 AS THE EARTH TURNS " I 've just got to get my hat . You wait a minute . " While he waited , 011y took no time to look for Stan . He was too busy making plans of his own . When Doris returned , skipping playfully over the wet grass , his mouth was grim , his mind set . Even his words were chosen . He took her firmly by the elbow and guided her through the shadows behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past her house . " Oh , 011y , this is the quickest way ! " " Well , I have to get back . Stan 'll be waiting for me . " " Stan ! . . . And the grass is so wet ! My slippers are awful thin . " " You can change them as soon as you get home . It wo n't hurt . " After a minute she said softly , " Gosh , you 've got a swell hold , 011y . I bet you 're a swell dancer . " " I do n't dance at all . " Nor did he . But he would learn this fall . He would have learned before the date of the sophomore teadance . He believed that usually came between Thanksgivingand Christmas . " Say , 011y ! I 'll teach you ! " " No . Look here , Doris . " He slackened his pace . " I think I ought to tell you . I 've decided we 'd better not see each other any more . " She gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did he think he was talking about , he could n't shake her like that , a girl he had been out with four Saturday nights running , and more than one knew of it too . Her voice was shrill , vicious . 011y hoped it would not carry as far back as the church . He hated her . SUMMER 225 " Now listen , Doris . You do n't understand . " He spoke very gently and put his arm across her shoulders , urging her by the pressure to walk beside him , to lean against him . He had been right ; there was even a slight odor about her , other than the perfume . " You do n't understand . It 's you I 'm thinking about . I 'm determined not to ruin your life , Doris . " He told her she was lovely . He said there was no reason why she should not marry a man who could give her everything , furs and jewels and motors . He explained that he might never have enough money and a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever did , it would be many years from now and she could not afford to risk her youth and beauty in waiting . He told her that what she should do was to keep herself from the small-time men she met here and go to the city , as she had once suggested ; the city was the place for her ; the city would be her element . All this he said in a tender , reluctant , generous voice , his arm adding reassurance , and Doris listened . She softened , and wept , and brightened . When they stopped before her dark house she flung her arms about his neck and laid her head on his shoulder . " Oh , 011y , " she declared , " I guess you 're right . But whoever I get , I bet I 'll never get one that 's as sweet as you ! " " I know I 'm right , " 011y said . " And you 'll get one much better than I am , Doris . " It was just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Slowly he set her away from him , holding her wrists while he kissed her hair , and then turned and marched away into the dark . He hated himself now as much as he had hated her. 226 AS THE EARTH TURNSBut as he walked , his distaste fell away from him . If he had sacrificed something of straightforwardness , he had won a new freedom , a new confidence with girls , which would add to both his comfort and his pleasure ; and the tact with which he had extricated himself had served Doris well . His might not be the way of a minister or a Boy Scout , but it was the way of an intelligent man , an intercollegiate debater , a fellow who moved sure-footed in a slippery world . He reached the church and finding it deserted , strode on whistling . His legs felt long , his shoulders broad , his lungs strong , his mind facile . Lights in the windows that he passed reminded him of the ice cream supper and his speech ; he wondered if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an important fact to recognize . " Well , Jen ! You up still ? I thought father left early ! " " He did , but I stayed cleaning up . " " Walked home then ? " " Yes . " " Alone ? That 's too bad . Probably you thought I 'd be around . " " I thought you might . And Stan did , too . We were both hunting for you , and when we did n't find you , we walked down along together . " " He came on over here , then , with you ? " " Yes , he was bound to . I told him he did n't need to bother . " " Well , that 's decent of him . I appreciate it . " Stan was a splendid fellow , a real friend . Jen looked pretty in the new blue voile dress that crossed over her round breasts and tied in a bow at the back ; her braidsSUMMER 227 were pinned smooth and shone with life and cleanli- ness ; Jen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cool , and cheerful with the checkered tablecloth and the lamp with the white shade and the almanac hanging under the ticking clock . 011y felt all in a glow . " You gave as fine a talk , " Jen said , " as ever I heard in my life . " " Oh , that ! " said 011y . IxA little before daybreak the next morning Jen was awakened suddenly . She stirred and listened , and the sound came again . Pound , pound , pound on the front door . She sprang out of bed and snatched at her dress , holding it before her as she hurried sleepily down the stairs and fumbled with the key . " It 's one of the Grants , " she thought . Mrs. Grant had come there in the night several times during the last few years , panting , calling , knocking under Jen 's window . ( " Jen ! Jen ! Will you send somebody to tele- phone for the doctor ? The doctor ! And am you come over to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time no one spoke , and the knock had been repeated only twice . Jen felt thankful . The noise always terrified the children . Wide awake now , she shook the door until the key gave in the lock , and peered out into the sil- very dark . It was Ed who stood there . " What is it ? " Jen asked . " What 's the matter , Ed ? " She thought of Margaret . " I got a telephone call a few minutes ago , " Ed said. 228 AS THE EARTH TURNSHis voice was deep and sober . The birds on the apple tree behind him sang shrilly . Jen could not see his features . " Kind of bad news , Jen . " " What is it ? " Jen asked again . " It 's Ralph , " Ed said . " What 's he done ? " Jen asked . " Where is he ? " She could not have explained , even to herself , what was in her head to lead to those questions , and she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked them . " He 's down there in Hartford , " Ed said . " There 's been an accident . He 's hurt . " Margaret had told him how to break the news . " Say first that he 's hurt , Ed . It wo n't be such a shock . " " Do you know how bad ? " " He 's dead , " Ed said . He doubted now if Margaret 's way had helped very much . " He was killed . It happenedlast night . He and two other fellows he took up as passengers . " After a minute Jen asked , " He was in a plane then ? " " Yes , in a plane . They said it happened last night in the evening . It was a nurse from a hospital telephoned . She said they had been trying all night to find out who to get in touch with . She said it was n't his fault , any way . Everybody was satisfied of that , she made it plain . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had forgotten to hold her dress before her . It hung from her hand as she stood in her white cotton nightgown , barefooted , her hair in braids down her back . " I suppose you 'll tell father , " Ed suggested . He onlySUMMER 229glanced at her , and then back toward his team waiting in the road . " Wo n't you ? " " Yes , " Jen said . " I 'll tell him . " " I 'll wait out here , " Ed said . " I 've got my milk to put on the train . If he wanted to go down to see about anything , or to send wor " Yes , " Jen said . " You wait . I 'll speak to him . " She went back up the stairs . Ed heard her open a door and say gently , " Father ! Father , you awake ? " Then he sought his cart , and sat hunched on the seat of it in the gathering light , the reins buckled and unbuckledbetween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his hat , came out of the back door and along beside the house . Mark Shaw stopped at the fence and rested his hands on it . " You tell them , " he said , " to send the boy home . " " Anything else ? " Ed asked awkwardly . He changed the position of the milk cans . " No , " Mark Shaw said . " I do n't see as there is anything else . You can tell them to send the boy home . " He turned away and then turned back as Ed clucked to his horse . " You tell them , " he said , for the first time unsteadily , " we 're expecting of him . " The next few days were hushed and strange and very busy . Jen tore the paper off the parlor walls and washed the ivory paint and put on new paper that had been waiting in the shedchamber since the spring , buff color with a neat gray figure . She sponged the carpet and rehung the pictures , one a crayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lize ; they were twins and both wore wide , white collars stiff with starch . She washed and mended the lace curtains and. 230 AS THE EARTH TURNSthey hung very full and rich . When the men brought in a big cedar box and placed it on a table between the windows she thought it was a fine , clean room for anybody to come into . She stood watching , quietly wiping away tears with the corner of her apron . " You 're certain you want it here ? " the undertaker asked in his soft , considerate voice . " It is n't usual to put a coffin before windows , Miss Shaw . " " That 's where we have it , though , " said Jen . " That 's where we had mother . " " You know it does n't seem best to open the coffin ? " " Yes , " said fen . " We know about that . It 's all right . " She touched one of the silver handles and said smiling , crying , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as good as any ? " " It 's plenty good enough . It 's neat and tasty , " the undertaker assured her . " It 's what you selected , " he added . " Yes , " Jen said . " That 's the way it seems to me . Kind of tasty . " She stood looking at it . " Now , " the undertaker suggested , " wo n't you set down a minute , Miss Shaw ? There 's a number of things we have to see to . " He wanted to know how many would come to the funeral , how many chairs he should bring , who would preach the sermon , whether she wanted singers , what floral pieces he should order for the family , who was to dig the grave , whether there would be a second serviceat the cemetery . Jen listened and answered carefully . No one doubted that it was her place . Mrs. Shaw was busy making over the black clothes she had worn when her first husband died and cutting new things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You see Jen . She 's tending to it . " He wentSUMMER 231into the field with his hoe as usual . There was no improprietyin this , only the furore of ploughing or mowingwould have surprised his neighbors ; nothing new could be begun , but what was started must go on . And he was of no use in the house where Jen cleaned and waked and Mrs. Shaw sewed and the cedar box in the parlor had its cover fastened down . " What is it ? " John asked Bun , peeking fearfully through a crack of the door into the still room . " It 's Ralph . " " Is Ralph in there ? " " Why , sure he is , " loftily . " Why do n't he come out ? " " He 's dead . " " Ca n't you come out if you 're dead , Bun ? " " ' Course you ca n't ; what do you think ! " " Ca n't he ever come out ? " " Of course not . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jen put John to bed he would not let her go . He kept calling her back to bring him a drink , to turn the light higher , to listen while he whispered to her ; he clutched her tight . " I wisht Ralph could come out , " he said . " Come out ! " " Come out of that box . " Jen thought swiftly , tired as she was . " Ralph is n't in any box , " she said . " Foolish ! " " Bun said he was . " " Well , he is n't . He 's off up in the sky somewheres Do n't you remember the way he went the last time hr was home ? Up in his airplane ? " " Ed and Margaret went , too , " John said . " Yes , " said Jen . " And they came back . But Ralph232 AS THE EARTH TURNSdid n't . He kept on going . Why , you could n't get Ralph into any box . He 's too big ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed her . " It 's , " Jen began bravely , " well , I guess it 's kind of something to say good-by to . Because he went so quick and we did n't have time to say it to him . We would n't want not to say it at all , would we ? Father especially would n't . You see , once Ralph was a little boy like you , and father 's going to miss him ; of course he 's been away a long time but father could always look ahead to his coming back , and now we know he wo n't come back any more . So we 'll have to be awful good to father for a while , you see , John . We 'll have to " She sat on the edge of the bed , rocking him in her arms , her tears wetting his hair , and already he was sound asleep . She smiled down at his eyelashes . The days were full of crying and smiling , but it would not do for babies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was all the Shaw babies , from George down , and she rocked him tenderly . Downstairs Mark Shaw and 011y sat alone in thekitchen . Mrs. Shaw was stitching in the sitting-room . " You been in ? " Mark Shaw asked out of the silence . 011y glanced up and shook his head . " We might go in , " Mark Shaw said . He went with slow steps past his wife , through the long front entry , and into the parlor , holding a handlamp. 011y followed him . They stood looking down into the blank , shining surface of the coffin . Behind it the white lace curtains stirred in the air from the open door . " Seems strange , " Mark Shaw said , " it 's so that we ca n't look at him . " He cleared his throat . " Seems asSUMMER 233if it would kind of help to look at him . Would n't it , 011y ? " 011y could not answer . His father stood there with the lamp in his big hand , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled . " He was a good boy when he was a young one , " Mark Shaw said . " I guess he was quite a flier , too . I do n't know much about such things , but I guess he was a good one . He had a knack with anything he tackled . Sometimes I get to thinking , of course , what if I had made him come home . I guess I could have . " 011y muttered something and moved toward the door . His father 's voice made him stop . It broke twice , humbly . " That 's what you said , though , was n't it , 011y ? You said  --  they had n't ought to  --  be held back " " God , father ! " 011y said . He went out and walked in the fields for hours , and the second crop of grass was drenched with dew . The next day Lize and Lois May came home . Two cousins from Haverhill came down , and a friend of Ralph 's from Hartford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Grants came . The yard was full of automobiles and carriages . The Shaws sat in the parlor , and the others in the sitting-room . The old Elder took his place in the doorway between to preach his sermon ; "  --  for it is soon cut off , " was his text ; and Margaret and Mil sang two hymns as they stood in the alcove under the stairs . After the singing the undertaker in his black coat read names , two by two . The Carpenters first , then the Forrests , then the Austins , and so on up to Mark Shaw and his wife last . It had been Jen 's wish to have the neighbors ' 234 AS THE EARTH TURNSnames read . " It is n't usual , " Mr. Anderson had told her , " to call any but the relatives . " But Jen had insisted . " We did for mother , " she said . " They 're ' most all some connection , one way or another , them that has lived here a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sat watching them as they passed by her to the front door , her face serene ; this was no time to cry , before so many ; the house looked neat and good and she felt proud of it ; the coffin was nearly covered in hothouse flowers , roses and delphinium and lilies and carnations ; they made a handsome sight . The undertaker read her name with 011y 's and she went out in her black dress and hat . The line had formed and she and 011y took their place at the head of it . Mark Shaw and his wife came and stood before them . Four men brought out the cedar box with all its flowers . The procession walked slowly down through the field to the little cemetery on the hill in the pasture . As the old Elder prayed beside the open grave , Jen could hear the children playing over in the grove where they had been sent . She hoped John was playing with the rest . " And so it is with Thee , " the Elder said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . Amen . " They walked back , disorganized . At the house Jen and Mrs. Shaw and 011y talked with the men and women , and shook hands . Lize and Lois May set out sandwiches and pie and cake that Jen had ready , and asked the guests to refresh themselves ; they would be late home to their suppers . But Mark Shaw had stopped at the shed for his hoe and gone , still in his best suit , to the field . His head barely reached above theSUMMER 235rim of the hill , jerking with the movement of his shoulders as he worked . " You 'll have to excuse father , " Jen said quietly . " He is n't just himself to-day . " xThrough August the sweet corn ripened and string beans were ready for picking . Mark Shaw and Ed and 011y finished the haying in George 's marshes , and three barns were full . Fall apples hung red and greenish-yellow on the trees . At night the yards and lanes were powdery with evening primroses , and poppy petals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer sweetness and hung heavy , fruity . John learned how to bring a stream of milk from a cow 's full bag . " That 's the youngest , " his father said , " that ever one of mine has done it . " One day the Shaws drove to tide water , and the children waded and the men caught alewives while the women sat in the shade and talked and spread out lunches . The fields were green again , the corn grew tall enough for children to hide in , the house smelled of sugar and spice , and early potatoes ripened . This was August like last August and like other Augusts that had gone before . Whatever else might change , the seasons kept their course . Pages 236 , 237 Deleted ( blank except : FALL ) FALLI66 O N'T you have an idea , " said Jen , " it 'll take itself out in talk ? " Stan shook his head . " No . I think they 'll go . . . . My father 's going to Boston next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; he may know of something . The papers say business is improving everywhere . . . He might as well . He 's no good here .

He heard about a tailor once that did . It 's always worried him . " " Well , I could give him hold of a needle , " Jen said , " if that 's all . " She shook her mending bag and a heap of riddled stockings , torn overalls , shrunken petticoats and buttonlessundershirts came tumbling into her lap . She laughed across it , and Stan laughed back , but did not speak . He sat quietly at the end of the stove , watching her hands feel through the pile to sort out what would239240 AS THE EARTH TURNSbe needed first . She took up a darner from which nearly all the varnish had been worn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; it slid into her father 's brown sock with a rasping sound and could not have been used with silk , but she had no silk in her bag . Now , as she worked , Stan could see only her braided hair , the round end of her nose , her shoulders and upper arms , one hand arched above a yawning hole , and her feet in their shabby , broad-toed shoes , each set firmly on the floor a little apart from the other , making a hollow between her knees to cup the heap of clothing . Beyond her , rain beat against the window . Otherwise there was no sound during the long pauses in their conversation . Jen 's fingers flew evenly at their weaving , and Stan watched them , stroking his soft wet hat with one hand as he held it in the other . " My land , I should think your mother 'd hate to go , " said Jen . " With so many young ones . Up to Boston . This time of year . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's what she wants . She 's lonesome here . She always has been . It does n't suit her . . . It does n't suit either one of them . " Jen took scissors by the points and pounded her darn smooth with the handle . " It suits you , do n't it ? " she asked . " Yes , it suits me fine . I always knew it would . I 've wanted to get onto a farm ever since I could remember . I like this town , too . I like the people . At first , you know , I thought they were going to hold out against us , but almost everybody acts all right now . . . I know it 's due a good deal to you folks here . I appreciate it .. . Yes , this suits me fine . " FALL 241 " Well , it 's something , " said Jen , " if one is satisfied . " She took up a small pair of overalls and snipped the frayed edges of a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clung , Stan noticed . She reached into a basket on the table for a piece of blue drilling , lifting her arm so high that Stan could see the under side of it ; that side was softer and whiter than the top . She settled back in her chair and set swift , not too small stitches around the patch ; it was the wearing quality she thought of , not beauty . " I do n't quite see , though , " Stan said , " how I 'd managealone . If I stayed here after they went . " " Oh , yes , " said Jen . " You could . Father did . He shifted for himself a year or more before he married mother . It 's wonderful what men can do if they have to . " " It is n't that so much . Not the house . It 's not much of a house to keep . . .

Potatoes are so plenty everywhere . " " She wants a lot . She wants a bathroom . " Jen dropped her hands . " A bathroom ! " " She wants furnace heat and linoleum on the floors ... You see , she had it in the city . She wants a car to ride hi . " " It is n't reasonable , " Jen told him . " You just getting started . " She went back to her sewing . Stan watched her . He had never talked with anybody else who let his mind travel its careful way , did not hurry him or excite him ;
