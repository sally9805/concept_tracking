txt Rescue accomplished , with thirtythree of the crew of fifty-nine aboard the Squalus saved , the navy settled down today to the more tedious task of salvage of the $5,000,000 submarine . There was a slackening of the feverish tempo that had prevailed since Tuesday noon , when the sister ship Sculpin reported that one of the newest and finest of the navy 's submarines was lying on a bed of mud off the Isles of Shoals thirteen miles south-southeast of here with her after compartments flooded . The crew on the Falcon , turning from rescue to salvage , was working steadily to take advantage of excellent diving weather which may break at any time , but the men were no longer under the pressure of having lives at stake . Even the salvage work was of a preliminary nature because no decision had been reached as to method . The officers were awaiting a decision from Washington from the Bureau of Naval Operations . Commanders A. R. McCann and A. I. , technical experts from the scene , were flown from the navy yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two Methods of Salvage There are two possible operations . Divers could seal the thirty-oneInch induction valve , the failure of which is believed to have caused the disaster , and all other openings in the hull and then air hoses on the Falcon could be used to blow out the water and permit the crippled ship to rise of her own buoyancy . It is a tricky and delicate operation to maintain a proper balance between positive and negative buoyancy so that the ship would not rise so fast as to be damaged . By the other operation , pontoons , huge floating tanks equipped with sets of valves , would be lowered in pairs alongside the stricken ship . They would be made fast and then the water would be expelled to provide the lift needed . This operation might take weeks . While this method is slower , the other is more risky . Rear Admiral C. W. Cole , commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard , returned to the rescue scene this morning , after a night ashore during which he got his first night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington that the Bureau of Naval Operations had decided to leave the method of salvage to Admiral Cole , navy officials here declared that they had received no information , nor could they confirm a report that Admiral Cole had decided to use pontoons . At the scene of operations it was also said that no decision had been made . Naval opinion here , however , inclined to favor the pontoon method . Survivors Enjoined to Silence All except three of the survivors of the accident were released from the hospital today . The three held for further observation were : Lieut . ( J. G. ) John C. Nichols , gunnery and torpedo officer , Chicago . Charles S. Kuney , yeoman , second class , Tulare , Calif . Charles A. Powel , radio man , second class , Leesville , La . They were suffering from slight bronchial inflammation and are to be held until there is no danger of pneumonia . The men left the hospital tinder strict orders not to discuss the accident with any one outside nor among themselves . Their testimony will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be convened here . No date has been set as yet . The men were warned that they would be severely disciplined for any infraction of the injunction against talking about the accident . While the naval inquiry is pending there has also been some discussion in Washington of a Congressional investigation . Representative George W. Bates , a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee , came here from his home in Salem , Mass . He said that he had flown over the scene of the wreck , but wanted a closer inspection of operations . He was sent out to the Falcon to get a first-hand view . Mr. Bates said that the navy was to be congratulated on the splendid job it had done in the rescue . None of the bodies in the afterchamber of the ship has been recovered . Divers were at work , but they spent their time fastening " down " lines and clearing the decks , while they awaited word from Washington on the method of salvage to be adopted . A mass funeral has been proposed for the twenty-six men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to this suggestion because of the hysteria it might develop . He has spent much of his time consoling widows and bereaved relatives and caring for the effects of the men who were lost . Clearing Deck of the Squalus There was no abatement of activity on the Falcon while the technical experts threshed out at the council table in Washington the complex problems of salvage . Radio antennae and similar encumbrances must be cleared from the deck of the Squalus , leaving it as sleek as the back of a whale , except for the hump . of the control tower and periscope . With a bright sun sparkling over a calm sea , diving conditions were ideal and the men were being swung over the side . one after another . As soon as a diver or a pair of divers came up and went into the compression chamber the diving crade was swung over the side with another man , copper helmet and cyclops eye glinting in the sun . The platform resembles a swing which might be used by the child of some fabulous giant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side until they are lowered into the water by the boom . The first permanent descent line , the guide which the divers used for their drop into the dark depths to make sure that their heavy leaden shoes clump onto the solid steel of deck plates and not into the sticky blue mud , was fastened around noon . It is believed that several such lines will be attached . With tons of water pressing down upon them the divers require great stamina to perform the slightest tasks and they face jobs which would be arduous , in some instances , on the surface . For instance , it was considered remarkable that Martin Sibitzky , the first diver on the deck of the sunken submarine Wednesday afternoon , was able to attach the " downhaul " for the rescue chamber in twenty minutes . His task was to slide a shackle over a ring on the deck , clip a bolt through and tighten the nut . The downhaul line was attached to the shackle . He spent an hour and fourteen minutes under water , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former standards , which are being upset on this job . Sibitzky , a boatswain 's mate , first class , was the first diver to reach the submarine . The first diver at the scene was Frank P. Miller , a former navy diver living at Portsmouth who volunteered his services , but he did not go down because the yard here was not equipped for handling a diver at the depth of 240 feet . Ten Pontoons Are Tested While work proceeded at the scene of the wreck , preparations went forward here at the navy yard for the salvage job . Ten pontoons , towed here from New London and Brooklyn , were taken into a basin just outside the drydoek and tested . They look like huge floating gasoline tanks , but they are equipped with numerous valves so that they may be filled with water and sunk alongside the sunken vessel and then pumped full of air to provide the lift which the boat needs to free itself . The hose inlets and outlet valves are sufficient to control the rate of rise of the submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel pops to the surface like a cork released from a bottle under water the salvage job will be lost . The ship at the bottom is under a pressure of 105.6 pounds a square inch at the 240-foot depth . If brought up rapidly , without allowing time for the inside pressure to adjust to the lessened outside pressure , the ship would open at the seams and again fill with water . For the conference on salvage methods Commander McCann , who developed the escape chamber to its present efficiency , and Commander of the Construction Corps , were flown to Washington from here in a navy seaplane this morning . They were among the technical board which met with Admiral Cole last night to discuss the problem of salvage . Captain W. F. Amsden , yard captain , took cognizance of rumors regarding sabotage and issued a statement in which he said : " Despite the reports in certain papers of the press , there is no evidence at this time to substantiate any rumor of carelessness or sabotage . " Naval officials at the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there had been any carelessness on the part of the crew of the Squalus or any sabotage . They wish to withhold judgment until the ship is raised and the cause definitely known , and Captain Amsden 's statement was mild in comparison with what some officers have ex -- pressed privately . In reply to requests Admiral Cole made the following statement : " There is little to add to the information already disseminated . Realizing the tremendous littered of our people in their navy and the general humanitarian temper of the nation , we have endeavored to keep the press informed of every event as it occurred . " The press has cooperated magnificently and I know our people join with us in appreciation of their efforts . " The rescue operations . have been completed and we are now devoting our energies to raising the stricken ship and return her to her place in our line of defense . We hope to be successful .
