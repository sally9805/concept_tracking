One afternoon last week conferees of Senate and House came to agreement on the Revenue Act of 1936 . It was not the law proposed in general terms by President Roosevelt on March 3 , not the bill cavalierly passed by the House on April 29 , not the bill passed after more careful examination by the Senate on June 5 . It was a brand-new tax bill , concocted in conference , a cross between the House and Senate bills . Day after its birth the hybrid bill was rushed to the House floor . No copies of the conference report had been printed . All that Representatives knew of it was what oral explanations their leaders gave . So weary were they , however , that they laughed , applauded , made speeches showing that they really did not know what they were voting on , then passed it , 221-to-98 . More deliberate was the Senate : 3 hours were devoted to debate . Senator Byrd of Virginia and other opponents who had studied it , explained with fatigue how bad they thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 hours after it appeared in the world the Revenue Act of 1936 became law . <P> Chief feature of the original House bill was that it virtually abolished all corporation income taxes save undistributed profits taxes , thereby encouraging dividend disbursements , placing the Government 's income-tax burden squarely on individual taxpayers , avoiding , in theory at least , cumbrous double taxation ( on corporations and again on stockholders ) . <P> Chief feature of the Senate bill was that it reduced the undistributed profits tax to a size where it would not greatly harm corporations which needed to lay by reserves out of profits , would not unduly discourage the creation of surpluses as cushions against depression . <P> The Act as passed doubled up taxation worse than ever , not only retained the old corporate taxes virtually in full but also abolished the normal tax exemption ( 4% ) which individuals could claim in regard to dividends . It allowed no exemption from the undistributed profits tax on any portion however small of a corporation 's profits retained for reserves , set the tax on undistributed profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the law : <P> Normal tax on corporations ' net income : 8% on the first $2,000 , 11% on the next $13,000 ; 13% on the next $25,000 ; 15% on all over $40,000 . <P> Tax on profits not distributed as dividends : 7% on the first 10% of total profits retained ; 12% on the next 10% ; 17% on the next 20% ; 22% on the next 20% ; 27% on the last 40% . Banks , insurance companies , corporations under contract to pay no dividends and corporations under contract to repay indebtedness out of current revenue will be exempt from this undistributed profits tax . <P> Individual income taxes : unchanged except that the normal tax exemptions on dividends received are abolished . <P> Capital stock tax : reduced from $1.40 to $1 per $1,000 with no change in excess profits taxes . <P> Special undistributed profits taxes on personal holding companies : on a scale from 8% on the first $2,000 to 48% on amounts over $1,000,000 . <P> Windfall tax ( to recover processing tax refunds ) : 80% . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , coconut , palm , etc. , etc.
