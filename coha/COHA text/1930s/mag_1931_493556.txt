A Postcard from Moscow P BY THE BOOTSTRAPS. ? When the Bolshevist revolution took place in 1917 , about one Russian in each three could read and write ? or pretended that he could . On top of all their other troubles , therefore , the Communists have faced a heroic struggle for literacy , since the sort of society they envisage is impossible without it . Already a great part of this work has been accomplished , if their figures are to be accepted ( and see no reason for doubting them ) . Under the Five Year Plan they are proceeding with redoubled energy , and they hope and expect to reach the goal of approximately complete literacy within a few years . Russia has burst out in a rash of new schools , both for children and adults . With the former , the two-platoon system is widely used , not because it is considered desirable in itself , but because ( as in New York City ) there are not enough buildings to Permit each child to go to school all day long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galore , emergency schools in the villages , special Communist-party schools , some of which are of university rank . Adult education , of course , is not confined to reading and writing . Everybody in Russia is studying something ? foreign languages , engineering , a new trade or technique . The desPerate shortage of trained personnel of all kinds is an encouragement to such work , and technical institutes are growing up everywhere to meet the demand . The Soviet educators have scoured the world for new pedagogical methods in the training of children , and the ideas of Dr. Dewey and other adl'ocates of free education have had much influence on them . At one time the Dalton Plan was widely used , though it has now fallen into disfavor . The Present method of training the younger children seems at first glance to have much in common with American progressive schools ; in theory , at least , the children educate themselves while the teacher is present as a combination of referee and informa- tion bureau . But even as in American schools , this Charming theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something learned . It is also subject to the very important qualification that the aim of Russian education is at present not free development of a free personality , but the production of good little Communists who will play their part in a revolution which , far from being ended , is in the Russian view no more than well begun . As far as curriculum is concerned , the school begins with the future , goes on to the present , and uses the past chiefly and briefly to drive home the sins of capitalism and Tsarist autocracy . Whatever may be said of other things going on in Russia , the communization of the schools is certainly 100- percent successful . Ten years hence , the generation which will just be coming upon the stage as adults will be as loyal to Marxian principles as are perhaps 5 percent of the total population today . Not so different. ? Enemies of the U.S.S.R. of course hold up their.hands in horror at what they call turning the schools into propaganda machines . But for consistency , they should be equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists , as I for one am heartily sick of hearing , have a religious devotion to their doctrine ; and no religion which amounted to anything has ever failed to insist on rearing its young in its own way . How long would an orthodox Jew last , in the United States , if he preached his doctrines in a Catholic parochial school ? How does the Russian policy differ from that expressed by the anti-evolution law in Tennessee and several other states ? Answer : in its efficiency . The Russians simply do a better ( a more ruthless ) job of the same sort . With a journalist 's luck , I arrived in Leningrad on the day when the U.S.S.R. took the most important step regarding education in several years . Primary teachers were put into the first category , the top of the heap in Russia , receiving equality with the all-important factory worker . This means that ambitious young men and women will again seriously consider a career in education as a possible alternative to one in industry ? something they have not done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise wages : the primary-school teachers will henceforth receive about ninety rubles a month . At the nominal exchange rate , this is $47 ; but as I suggested in a previous article , money rates mean next to nothing in Russia . As a member of the first category , the Russian teacher will buy his goods at lower prices and from larger stocks , as well as having a dozen other varieties of special privilege . More than shooting. ? In considering the Rus , sian educational system , the Red army must not be overlooked . In theory , every youth must serve two years , beginning at twenty-one ; but if , before that time , he has acquired a fairly good education , one year of his service is remitted . Most of the re . cruits , of course , are peasant boys who are illiterate or almost so ; and their two years in the ranks are made the occasion for a highly concentrated educational effort Not only are they taught to read and write , but they are given a trade ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that even if they are not loyal to the regime when they go in , they are aggressively so when they come out . A feature of the Russian education which is coming to be of vast importance is the application of " aptitude tests " and the subsequent shaping of each child 's training in the light of their results . Broadly speaking , the choice of an occupation is already much more the result of these tests than of casual individual preference or family tradition . The examinations are given as early as the age of eight , and are repeated from time to time throughout the school course ; at several places in the curriculum an opportunity is made for selected pupils to be drained off into special vocational schools , where they will stay for varying periods depending upon the nature of the vocation in each case and the special abilities or disabilities of the individual in question . These tests are given and the findings followed , not only in choosing workers for industrial occupa- , tions , but for the arts . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and those who receive high scores are drawn off into special institutions where they are educated , entirely at the cost of the State , if that is necessary , to become the composers and performers of music for the next generation . American musicians who have had the chance to see the workings of this scheme in detail , and to hear the new music which is being composed under its auspices , are enthusiastic about it to the point of frenzied jealousy that there is no equivalent at home . Words , words , words. ? As might be expected , the educational effort has been accompanied by an enormous increase in the consumption of books , magazines and newspapers . The circulation of dailies seems to be limited only by the amount of print-paper available ; and to an American this fact is doubly remarkable in that the contents of these journals , devoted so largely to the technical progress of the Five Year Plan , seem about as thrilling as an average issue of The Engineering News-Record . " Wall newspapers " hang in every factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , for instance , in the Moscow rescue home for prostitutes ) , and have a combined annual circulation which must run into billions . Magazines cir culate in relative abundance , but they are not the miscellaneous repositories with which we are familiar at home . They resemble much more our trade and technical press , being devoted to special interests of special groups . This is also more or less true of the books and pamphlets which issue from the presses of the State publishing trust in enormous quantities . Many Americans were doubtless startled when Boris Pilnyak , the Russian novelist , remarked in the course of his recent visit that he was probably the richest man in the U.S.S.R. Nevertheless , the statement might easily be true . Russian artists of all sorts are paid on the piece-work basis and have been since long before the system was generally introduced into industry and recognized in Stalin 's famous speech of five months ago . An author of books or composer of music gets royalties just as in America ; an artist or sculptor is paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is able to drive , which depends , again , upon his reputation and the intrinsic merit of his work . The payment made to Russian authors is in sharp contrast , it must be noted , with that given to foreigners whose works are translated and published . Except in a few cases where a writer has been able to drive an individual bargain with the State publishing house , these works are pirated without corn pensation ? a situation which few Russians will defend except upon grounds of temporary necessity , and one which seems likely to be remedied before very long . The Communist goes to the p/ay. ? Russians have always been fond of the theatre , and have suffered no diminution of their allegiance . All the old playhouses are open , and many new ones , and they are packed to the roof every night of the week . The Moscow Art Theatre continues to do the work which has made it , by general agreement , first in the world . I am assured that the ballet has suffered no impairment since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for me one of the great emotional experiences of a lifetime . The opera is equally nurtured and with equal result . Even the semi-amateur performs ances of the workers ' theatres , and such propaganda vaudeville as " The Blue Blouse , " are full of individual bits of impersonation any one of which , in America , would , probably make its creator famous for life . In the Art Theatre , ballet and opera , the mas terpieces of the past continue to be given in the traditionail manner ; but the new plays are of course i prmarly propaganda to help carry on the warfare against all enemies of socialism and the Five Year Plan . The argument as to whether the finest art is possible under these circumstances is one which will very likely last forever ; and I have neither space nor inclination to enter upon it here . The six or seven plays and motion pictures which I have seen , in which propaganda was the dominating element , were certainly thoroughly inferior from evert ' standpoint except that of general tempo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad art in America when there was no intention to propP gandize for anything except more money at the ba% of Some of the ablest Russian playwrights and tion-picture producers are solving ( or evading ) the . the problem by writing in historical terms either of October , 1917 , revolution or of previous abortive attempts at revolt in Russia 's long , bloody history . Thus , one of the finest pieces in the present rePel ; tory of the Moscow Art Theatre , " The Armoreci Train , " deals with an incident in eastern Siberia at the time of the counter-revolutionary efforts of Kolchak . It is a rapidly moving melodrama : Red partisans throw themselves on the railroad track to prevent the passage of the Whites ' military train , Japanese spies ferret out a Socialist commissar and shoot him , a Canadian soldier , captured by the Reds , is about to be executed when , although he speaks no Russian , he reacts properly to the magic name of Lenin ; and so on . The play is better than it sounds in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Theatre it becomes an unforgettable experience .... The same trick of offering revolutionary history is performed much less happily in a number of recent motion pictures dealing with various peasant revolts of the past three hundred years . Those Which I have seen were unspeakable in story , direction , acting and , above all , in lighting . However , one new picture which I have been unable as yet to see , dealing with the life of the " wild boys " of ten years ago , has elicited frenzied enthusiasm not only in Russia but in Germany . Museums for dead capitalism. ? The foreign visitor to Russia notices at once the long line of empty , or almost empty , shop windows : even those institutions which are still open have so few goods that the Russians have nicknamed them " museum stores " ? " You just go in , look around a while , and come out again . " It is , however , absurd to sup-Pose that these empty windows are indicative of the economic difficulties which are being experienced . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer uses these places . The great bulk of the goods go to the cooperatives , the factory stores and other special depots , and are handed Over to the customer as fast as they come in . When You think about this , you realize that shop windows Piled high with purchasable things , such as are universal in America and other capitalist countries , are actually a terrific economic waste . Goods worth many millions of dollars remain on display , sometimes for long periods , serving primarily as a mere advertisement of themselves . Russia 's boarded-up or empty shop windows represent the elimination 91 ! all that loss of interest on capital investment . 0 be sure , she will experience some of it again When she gets back from a scarcity to a surplus , ewnomy , but even then , her waste will probably be out a tiny fraction of that seen in those lands which are still ( at least partially ) addicted to laissez-faire , Thee Soviet government , in its present endeavor t , e1 lure in foreign visitors and obtain their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created a situation which to the tourist seems like madness , the it is in fact perfectly sensible . He visits h e free public market and sees gloves , for instance , or ( and actually being bought ) at $5 or $6 a vthe a n ' ( ten or twelvF rubles ) ; and then he goes into Torgsin " stores , which now exist in all the Prin ? , eiPai centers , and finds every sort of merchandise on sale in large quantities , at reasonable New York prices ? but for foreign currency only ; no rubles accepted . He pays " Intourist , " the highly efficient Soviet travel bureau , perhaps $15 a day for his visit , which includes among other things room and board in an excellent hotel ; and then he adds up the prices ( in rubles ) of what he eats in the dining-room and discovers that a ! a carte the meals alone would cost him perhaps $30 or $40 a day ! Does this mean that the ruble is inflated within Russia as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be bought for 10 percent of its nominal value ? Not necessarily ; a ruble in Russia is just as hard to earn as fifty cents in America . What it does mean is that the tourist is placed , temporarily , in a preferred category of the population , both when he buys food in the hotel and when he shops in " Torgsin . " But the Russian who , with rubles , eats in the same hotel or buys gloves in the free market , is sharing in the extremely limited quantity of things left over after the great bulk of the population has had at least its most urgent needs satisfied on a rationing basis . The new paradise of tourism. ? More than 5,000 tourists visited Russia this summer , 90 percent of them Americans . Next summer it is expected that the number will be at least twice , perhaps three times , as large . Those who feel a little squeamish about coming to a country where so many persons are underfed , lest they take sustenance from the mouths of the hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar spent in Russia by a tourist makes it possible for the government to forgo the export of a dollar 's worth of produce ( much of it food ) which can then be released for consumption by the Russians . Railroad travel is quite as easy and pleasant ( if you stick to the main routes ) as it is in western Europe ; hotel accommodations are perfectly comfortable . The diet offered to the petted tourist is far better than what the average Russian gets ; and while it is still a little plain and monotonous , it involves no serious hardship . The art treasures of Moscow and Leningrad are incomparable ; the museums which record the life of Tsarist days have unbelievably rich collections , while the contemporary museums which tell the story of the revolutions of 1917 , Lenin 's life , and so on , give a panorama of current history which to the average American is far more interesting than the dead glories of Versailles and Sans Souci .
