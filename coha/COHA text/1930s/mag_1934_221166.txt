" If the day 's markets had declined-if they had merely continued to stand still . . . Wall Street would not have been surprised , " rumbled Alexander Dana Noyes , venerable financial editor of the New York Times , in commenting on last fortnight 's election reactions . " What actually happened on the New York Stock Exchange would hardly have been predicted . " <P> What happened was a sudden upward surge in both security and commodity prices that gathered momentum day by day . The Stock Exchange had not one but two 1,000,000-share days , and by the end of the week the Dow-Jones industrial stock averages had climbed to the highest level since last June . <P> Old Mr. Noyes , who seldom draws his historical parallels from any period later than the 1870s , balanced his explanation for last week 's bullishness not on the possibilities of an inflationary Congress ( see p. 12 ) but on the " not at all ungrounded belief that this period 's recovery from depression has pursued the general path marked out by previous experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
