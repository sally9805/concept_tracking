One day I received a note from Mr. Henry White , asking if I would allow him to take me to see some of the historic places in Paris , of which he had a most interesting knowledge . As a young man he had been secretary of our embassy there . While we were going from one place to another , he asked if he could talk to me as a friend instead of as a member of the Peace Commission . " Why , of course , " I said . Then , in his courtly manner , he turned to me and said : " Dear lady , then I am going really to avail myself of that permission and tell you a few of the jealousies and sore spots in the commission to which , I think , by a word to the President , you can bring balm . The first one is that Lansing is terribly sore because the meet  --  ings the President attends are held in Colonel House 's suite instead of his . Since he is the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right ; for he is being ignored . Also all the newspapermen , in quest of in  --  formation , are told by Gordon Auchineloss to see his father-in-law , Colonel House . " M ORE and more was the President caught up in the train of work until , after the Peace Con  --  ference opened , on January IS , 1919 , I scarcely saw him except at meals . My time was filled , at first , with visits to canteens , places of recreation for soldiers . hospitals and rehabilitation centers for broken bodies . Returning from such a visit , I found the door of the President 's study open , and there on the floor were spread maps , and on their knees before them were my husband and three or four experts , trying to work out new national frontiers made necessary by the war . They called to me to come in , and I said : " You look like little boys playing a game . " My husband replied : " Alas , it is the most serious game ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my estimation , the future peace of the world . " The days and nights went on with unceasing work for him . The meetings of our commission at the Hotel Crillon wore begun , in some way I do not know , in the rooms assigned to Colonel House , and so they contin  --  ued to be held there for several weeks , // I told Mr. White that these things were so small that . I was sure they had never entered the President 's mind , but that I knew he would appreciate his thought in telling me of them , and he would look into them . " Yes , " Mr. White answered , " they are small things , but Lansing is a small man , and sometimes personal vanity makes or mars the success of large affairs . " I begged him to feel I would always welcome his confidences , knowing they came from interest and friendship . I waited until the following Sunday afternoon , the one holiday of the week for my husband , to tell him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ings , I can hear his voice now as he replied : " Why , I am very sorry about that ; it never occurred to me , and I am quite sure it never did to House . " He then added : " I will see that it is changed , for White is right about it . " I then told him about the newspaper matter , and to that he said , " I have been working out a plan in my own mind . It is this : I have decided to ask Mr. Hay Stannard Baker , for whom I have the highest regard , to act as an intermediary between our commission and the other press representatives . It is highly important that the right news be given out , so I am going to ask Baker to accept this posi  --  tion , and come to sea me every night at seven o'clock , when I will go over with him everything that has transpired during the day , telling him what is fin  --  ished and what is unfinished business , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers , but that questions still under discussion be omitted . " This plan was followed to the letter ; Mr. Baker never failing to appear at the stroke of seven ; often having to wait an hour , or even more . Thanks to Pocahontas I ALWAYS tried to be at home and ready for din- t ner in time to attend these interviews . In this way I kept in current touch with the work of the confer  --  ence , and this made it unnecessary to burden my weary husband with questions . Mr. Baker kept up a fire of questions and never was satisfied until he had each point clarified . So it was a stimulating half hour . Mr. Wilson inaugurated these meetings purely out of justice to Secretary Lansing and to compose any difference that may have threatened to arise between him and Colonel House because the newspapermen seemed to prefer the latter as a source of news . In the President 's mind was not the least suspicion that Colonel House 's sessions with the press were deliberate on his part , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that of his colleagues . It was about this time that I made the acquaint  --  ance of the old Duchess of R. The title is one of the oldest titles in France , the dukedom at that time being held by a little grandson around seven years old . His father had been killed in the war , leaving the elderly duchess alone in a great house in the old aris  --  tocratic quarter of Paris . Like so many courageous Frenchwomen , she had opened her beautiful home as a hospital . This gives you the picture of the duchess as it was given to me by the Serbian Minister , M. Vesnitch , who had sent me an urgent note begging an immedi  --  ate audience . M. Vesnitch had headed the Serbian Mission which had come to America after our entry into the war . On our arrival in Paris I felt we were already good friends , but could not imagine what he wished to see me about in such haste . With many apologies and real embarrassment , he told me the following : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and had the honor of taking in the Duchess of R. I asked her if she had met the Presi  --  dent and Mrs. Wilson , and to my great surprise she answered : ' No , and I do not want to meet them . Paris has gone mad about President Wilson and I am sick of hearing about them . What are they ? Only ordinary Americans , with no claim to aristocracy or title . ' Oh , ' I said , ' duchess , there you are wrong . for Mrs. Wilson is directly descended from a princess ; her grandmother seven times removed was the great Princess Pocahontas . I have just returned a short time ago from the United States , and there I read all of this in a paper , which I kept and can show to you . ' ' Why , ' said the duchess , ' this is very important , and I knew nothing of it at all . Of course I must go and call on Mrs. Wilson at once and give an entertain  --  ment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that is the reason I begged that you see me ut once , that I could tell you about this , so that you will be sure to receive the duchess when she calls . " Alas , the grand lady had already come and written her name in our hook , but I had not seen her , and so I had to confess this to him . His face was tragic at this information , for he sincerely thought he was put  --  ting me in touch with what he considered a great social opportunity . I warmly appreciated his interest and friendship , but I could not help being amused just the same . After he had gone , I made an amusing story of the incident to tell my husband , adding that , as my mother was then living at the Hotel Powhatan in Washington , I thought I would get a picture post card of it and send it to the duchess as the photo  --  graph of " my ancestral palace , now used as a hotel for war workers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow laughed and said : " Please wait until I finish this job over here before you play jokes on any French lady . " 4 Duchess of the OW Regime FEW days later Mrs. Wallace , wife of our Amer -- LA ivan Ambassador , gave a reception for me , ask  --  ing principally French ladies . Presenting them in her easy , gracious way , she brought forward one who was not very tall , inclined to stoutness , and dressed in black far from modish . As she said : " This is my friend , Mrs. Wilson . . . . The Duchess of R. , who says she is very eager to meet you , " the lady fixed piercing black eyes upon mend looked me over from tip to toe . Then she curtsied as though I had really been of the royalty . She said she had heard much of me through a friend who had been in Amer  --  ica , and wished to give a dinner for the President and me on any night . we would name . I thanked her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working so hard we had to give up all dinner parties unless they were official . " Oh , " she said , " then you , madame , must come alone . " I explained that I did not dine out without Mr. Wilson . The duchess said she was " desolated . " Then suddenly she smiled and said : " Oh , but I learn that you visit the hospitals . " " Yes " I said , " I do . " " Voile ! " she cried . " My house is a hospital , so you will come now ? " I saw that Pocahontas , my " royal " ancestor , was fighting hard for my social prestige , so replied : " will , with great pleasure , do that . " " Yes , " she said , " I must have you under my roof ; please write me a day when you will come . " I asked Miss Benham to send a note saying I would be glad to come on the following Tuesday . Miss Benham came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and we entered a charm  --  ing garden completely hidden from the street by a high wall . As the motor swung around the driveway , the door was open , and on the bottom of the three steps stood small boy in black velvet with a wide lace collar , holding in his small hands long sprays of pink apple blossoms . Behind him stood a cardinal of the church in his gorgeous red robe , and grouped about were the duchess and the ladies who comprised her staff of nurses  --  all dressed in white , with long veils , and no color save the Red Cross on the band that held the veils . As I stepped from the limousine , the little duke knelt on one knee , kissed ( Continued on Page az ) explain how he sold the liquor to buy her a doll , why , maybe they 'll be a little easier on him . " In spite of her disapproval , Miss Hans accompanied them . And , as they approached the courthouse , she actu  --  ally thawed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said surprisingly . " And it will be a lesson to him anyway . " They were admitted to a small and stuffy room in the basement of the courthouse , foul with stale tobacco odors . There they sat . fidgeting , for perhaps half an hour . Then u short fat man entered with a bunch of papers under his arm . He sat at a table and fussed importantly with the papers . Next came the magistrate , a skinny old man , noted locally for his irascibil  --  ity . He seemed quite unconscious of the kids ' hostile glances , but glared at the fat man as though he were the cul  --  prit . Big Joe grew suddenly pessimis  --  tic about the chances of moving that old coot to pity . Folks said that the only fun he got out of life was hanging heavy punishments on the local petty malefactors . There was certainly no sunshine in his soul , like the hymn said . Finally , Uncle Pete entered , es  --  corted by the detective and the local constable  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Babe and nodded to Big Joe . His was the only friendly face in that cheerless little room . Little Joe , who had expected to seo Uncle Pete in striped prison garb , was disappointed to behold him in his own clothes . His sodden glance rested list  --  lessly upon the family , sitting tensely in the front row of chairs . " Hello , Uncle Pete ! " Babe called softly , but the magistrate froze her with a frown . The fat man read the charge and Uncle Pete 's response was an unintelli  --  gible mumble which the magistrate took to he a " Not guilty " plea . The detective presented his ease  --  how and when and where the accused had sold him the liquor . " What right had you to be asking people for liquor ? " Miss Hans burst out indignantly . " On Sunday too ! " " Order ! Order ! " chirped the fat man . " You 're just one of these  --  stool  --  doves , " cried Miss Hans , as though a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Pete . " Silence ! " cried the magistrate in his thin , raucous voice . Unperturbed , the detective pro  --  duced the bottle he had bought from Uncle Pete , and at the sight of it Miss Hans gave a startled gasp . Will you be good enough to con  --  tain yourself , madam ? " rasped the magistrate . Will you be good enough to taste what 's in that bottle ? " cried Miss Hans . She was trembling with excitemerit in her suddenly adopted role of Portia . The magistrate took the bottle and held it curiously to the light . It was still full . He removed the cork and sniffed the contents warily . " What in the aiteh is this ? " he de  --  manded angrily of the detective . " The celebrated potato liquor , " said the detective , grinning brazenly . But he took the bottle back and sniffed it in his turn . He winced . He tipped the bottle and took a taste of the contents , which he instantly spat out , shuddering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  vited . " It might be good for what ails you . " Uncle Pete was finally aroused , his professional pride stung to the quick . " Isemme see that stuff , " he grunted , reaching for the bottle . " See it ! " bellowed the detective . " I 'd like to pour it down your throat ! " The magistrate banged angrily on his desk . " The case is dismissed ! " lie snorted , and added sarcastically : " So far as know , there 's no law against selling castor oil . " " What 's he mean , Pop ? " Little Joe whispered hoarsely . " He 's goin ' to let Uncle Pete off . " " Hooray ! " cried Little . foe . The magistrate scowled . The fat man blew his nose . The detective glared angrily at Uncle Pete . Only the constable was grinning broadly as they made their triumphal exit . Uncle Pete did not join in their exultation . Rather , he seemed like a man who has suffered a mortal injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you been meddlin ' with my potato licker ! " " Just that one bottle , " Miss Hans answered defiantly . " I found it in the root cellar . I poured out the liquor and put castor oil in it . And it 's lucky for you that that was the bottle you sold . I recognized it as soon as I saw it , " Somewhat mollified , Uncle Pete climbed into the democrat . Several miles out of town , he began to chuckle wheezily . " Heh , heh ! " he giggled finally , " That cop paid two dollars for a bottle of castor oil . Was he dumb ! " " Plumb dumb ! " Big Jois agreed . " I 'm sure glad Uncle Pete got out of jail , " Babe said . " Now he can go to Sunday school with us next Sunday . " " Da  --  dang tootin ' , " said Little Joe . Amid the rattle of the loose tires on the democrat and the " snick ! snick ! " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hum that hymn they sang at Sunday school : " There is sunshine in my soul to  --  day ? ' ' He thought it was kind of a nice hymn . He thought that sometimes even Uncle Pete had sunshine in his soul . ( Continued from Page 21 ) my hand and presented the blossoms . Then the cardinal held up his hand in silent benediction , after which we were greeted by the duchess , who presented her friends . After we had been to the wards and greeted the soldiers , we went into the large dining room , where a table was spread for tea . To my surprise , I was the only person seated , everyone else standing , as in the presence of royalty . Certainly M. Vesniteh had impressed the duchess , and I shall always recall that afternoon as a unique experience , and treasure a real regard for my hostess , whom later I learned to know better .

This half-Indian boy returned to Virginia with his father , where he married and where hundreds of his descendants remain , bearing such family names as Archer , Bolling , Branch , Cabell , Grayson , Harrison , Randolph , Robertson , Skip-with , Tazewell , and many , many others . My own line of descent fol  --  lows : The grinding work of the conference went on day after day and late into every night , the only rest for my hus  --  band being Sunday , when he dismissed every care , slept later , and often went in the motor for a long drive with me . The French papers and people kept commenting on the fact that be did not go to see the devastated regions , and M. Jusserand visited us nearly every day to urge his going . My husband had followed all this terrible destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own eyes would have been only a tangi  --  ble verification of what he already knew . Add to this that he was working eighteen hours a day , and was eager to finish and get home , where the country must readjust itself to the normal con  --  ditions of peace . When we first readied Paris , his hope had been to get the major terms of the Peace completed , so that when he came home for the closing of Con  --  gress in March , 1919 , it would not be necessary for him to return to Paris . The month lost after our arrival , he felt , was a great waste , and so he was driving every hour to try and make up this loss . His one hope was to get the confer  --  ence to agree on the inclusion of the Covenant of the League of Nations as part of the treaty . Through this instru  --  mentality he felt that any unwise or unjust terms of the treaty itself could and would be adjusted in the future . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international disputes , providing pacific means of settlement , as men could meet and talk over their problems as neighbors . Many books have already been written of this tense period , dealing with M. Clemenceau , an avowed cynic , distrustful of humanity 's ability to rise to unselfish heights ; with Mr. Lloyd George , a political weathervane , shift  --  ing with every wind that blew across the Channel , lest it affect his personal fortunes ; with Signor Orlando , whose ear was ever to the ground , for fear that Italy should not get all she hun  --  gered for . I will not go over that ground , but try to show what I saw with my own eyes . Amid all those com  --  plexities my husband stood practically alone , with very lukewarm support from some members of his own com  --  mission , such as Lansing , who , over his own signature , has since admitted that he accepted a place on the commission knowing ho was antagonistic to prin  --  ciples which he would be called on to promulgate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let defeat turn him aside as long as a remnant with which to carry on was left .

All I could do was to try and ' ' soothe him with a finer fancy , **27;1543;TOOLONG . " It was at this time that the pressure was strongest for him to visit the de  --  spoiled areas . Finally , from sheer weariness , he said he would go . It meant giving up his one day of rest , for he would not postpone the work of the conference longer than one day , that being a Saturday . We were to be back late Sunday night . Our first objective was Rheims . At the door of the great cathedral we were met by the old priest who had stayed on with his distraught people all through the awful bombing raids . He was very frail looking , and wore a black cassock and one of the flat black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color being gloves of crimson silk much too large for his slender hands . A light snow was falling , and it drifted silently down through the great holes in the roof . Pointing to them , he said , in tones as tender as a mother 's speaking of an injured child : " lVly cathedral stood through three other raids with  --  out . any bad harts , but the fourth one she could not withstand , and this broke her . " The few people who were left in the town were now coming out of the great wine caves which had become homes to them , and a dreary picture they made . Women with shawls over their heads and thin shoulders ; men in shabby clothes ; all their faces pinched with cold and hunger . From there we went to the Chemin des Dames and to Soissons , finding the town virtually deserted . On leaving , we took the regular road out , but were soon warned to go no farther , as an am  --  munition dump had been accidentally set afire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the streets , which , a few minutes before , had been almost depopulated , alive with French troops . They swarmed about our ear in the friendliest way , one soldier shout  --  ing that his comrades believed the pease Mr. Wilson was fighting for was not the peace their own government was trying to gain . They called for the President to speak . Where , we asked , had these soldiers been when we were in the town before ? In their billets , they said ; their officers having ordered them there on hearing that the President of the United States Was coming . As soon as our car had dis  --  appeared , for good , as they thought , the soldiers were set at liberty . " But fate has stepped in , " the spokesman said , and brought you back to us . " In these illuminating circumstances , there was nothing the President could ikay except to thank the men for their welcome .. The incident affected Mr. Wilson profoundly . So French soldiers , the men who had saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tact with the author of the principles on which the fighting had been brought to an end . It was of a piece with the re  --  fusal of the authorities to permit the working women of Paris to see him , and the dispersion of the countless multi  --  tude gathered in Rome to hear the President . On the ride back to Paris that night my husband was thoughtful and de  --  pressed . The President still hoped to get things far enough along to obviate the , necessity of a second trip to Paris fol  --  lowing his return home for the closing of Congress in March , 1919 . As the days rolled on , this became a vain hope . So we made plans to go , calculating on an absence of a little more than three weeks . This brought to my husband 's mind , the question of who should be in charge of the United States delegation during this absence . Mr. Lansing was next in official rank , but by this time the Pres  --  ident had begun to feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the League ideal . At one time Mr. ' Wil  --  son considered asking Mr. Lansing to resign . He discussed this with Colonel House and with me . There were many reasons against such a course . The dis  --  ruption might hinder rather than help . 9n the end it was decided that Mr. Lansing should remain as the titular ad interim head of the American Com  --  mission , though the actual authority should be in the hands of Colonel House . Up to this time , Colonel House had been of inestimable help to the Pres  --  ident . He had worked with and for him . But the one thing which had dis  --  turbed me was that Colonel House so seldom disagreed with my husband . Of this I had spoken to Woodrow , saying : " It seems to me that it is impossible for two persons always to think alike , and while I like Colonel House im  --  mensely , I find him absolutely colorless and a ' yes , yes ' man . " The Messenger of Peace My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is altogether true . You forget that It is my constitutional duty to form  --  ulate policies and take the responsibil  --  ity for them . House thinks straight , and can gather public opinion and get the real views of men in a way that is impossible for me . I consider one of the greatest handicaps of this office is the fact that few people are natural or frank with a President ; they seem to ? feel they must flatter and fawn . So House brings to me something I can not get in any other way . " I reminded my husband of the Colonel 's behavior with reference to the railroad message . From that day on , I had been inclined to question the worth of Colonel House 's services as an adviser . In public life , however , one often is obliged to use the instrument ' adiest to hand . Since 1916 , when the Iden first began to take shape in my husband 's mind , Colonel House had been a firm believer in a League of Na ? 1 tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's though t on the subject . The immediate fight was to incor  --  porate the League Covenant into the body of the treaty . With this done be  --  fore he sailed , my husband could lay the tentative draft before the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate , get suggestions for amendments and bring them back to Paris on his return . Thus Mr. Wilson saw a really fortunate cir  --  cumstance , after all , in his journey home . He explained to me that he wanted to put everything squarely be  --  fore the Foreign Relations Committee , and that it would tie natural for the senators to wish to study the first draft and make their own suggestions . The President was sure he would be able to accept any changes they desired . On February 14 , 1919 , he was to make his plea before the full Peace Conference for the inclusion of the Covenant of the League of Nations in the treaty , and by the votes of the del  --  egates that great question should he decided . And that night we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Claws Of course , I was eager to be there to hear him , but as the meeting was for members only , this seemed impossible . Mr. Wilson always stood away from asking favors for himself or for anyone close to him ; so I would not add to his cares by repining over my disappoint  --  ment , but went to our dear Doctor Grayson and asked if he thought it would be very dreadful if I should ask M. Clemenceau if there was any way in which I could be admitted . The doc- tor said he , too , was crazy to go , so if I would let him ask the Tiger , saying he came from me , he was sure the old Frenchman would try to arrange it . Before doing this , though , I decided to ask my husband if it would in any way embarrass him should my request be refused . He thought it over a mo  --  ment , and said : " In the circumstances it is hardly a request ; it is more a com  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That being the case , then I shall certainly make it . " I said , and he looked up from his desk and laughed : " Willful woman , your sins be on your own head if the Tiger shows his claws . " " Oh , he ca n't , you know ; they are always done up in gray cotton , " I an  --  swered , referring to the gloves Clemen  --  ceau wore , even at table . The meeting was in the great Room of the Clock , in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and under the huge timepiece from which it takes its name was a long table for the heads of the commission . The other delegates occupied seats with desks or tables in the main part of the room . At the far end , facing the clock and the conference table , heavy red brocade curtains concealed a small alcove just large enough for two straight chairs , and seemingly made for eaves  --  droppers . When the conference assembled , hidden away in that tiny place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had been told we must be in our places before any of the delegates came , to keep quiet , and to stay until all had gone , before we came out of hiding . Doctor Grayson said that . the old gentleman had added that if our presence were discovered , he would have the wife of every delegate pester  --  ing the soul out of him . So we were in honor bound to follow his directions . It is proverbial that the French hate drafts . Therefore every window was closed tight and our retreat grew stifling 84 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January IL 1536 behind the heavy brocade , but . I for  --  got it when the preliminary work , last  --  ing an hour , was over and my husband rose to speak . He was exactly opposite us , and as every eye was centered upon him , we ventured to part our curtains enough to see the whole scene . It wits a great moment in history , and as he stood there  --  slender , calm , and powerful in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all depressed countries  --  men , women and little children  --  crowding round and waiting upon his words . He rarely made long speeches , and this was no exception . I could see it had made a great impression , and I longed to go to hint and tell him all I felt . Then the ballots were placed before the delegates . After the usual proced  --  ure , which takes much time , the result was in favor of the measure . The mem  --  bers rushed to grasp Mr. Wilson 's hand . In the general noise , we felt free to stretch our muscles , for we had been motionless nearly four hours . A Vision of the Future Once outside the building , we were only a part of the crowd that always stood there waiting . Presently I saw the familiar blue ear bearing the Presi  --  dent 's seal . It was not in motion , so I knew my husband was waiting for me . Oh , how glad I was to find hint and tell him all the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned back in the car . " Are you so weary ? " I asked . " Yes , " he answered , " I suppose I am , but how little one man means when such vital things are at . stake . " Then continuing : " This is our first real step forward , for I now realize , more than ever before , that , once established , the League can arbitrate and correct mistakes which are inevitable in the treaty we are trying to make at this time . The resentments and injustices caused by the war are still too poignant , and the wounds too fresh . They must have time to heal , and when they have done so , one by one the mistakes can he brought to the League for readjust  --  ment , and the League will act as a per  --  manent eleariughouse where every na  --  tion can come , the small as well as the great . " Then turning with one of his radiant smiles , he said : " It will be sweet to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that I have kept the faith with the people , particularly with these boys , God bless them . " I saw he was deeply moved , and we sat silent until the ear turned into our gates and the soldiers stood at salute as we went in . In a few hours we drove to the rail  --  road station , where the usual official party was gathered and the train of the French president awaited us . A crim  --  son carpet was spread , and with much kissing or my hand and clicking of heels and speeches and band music , we were on our way to the U. S. A. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt were among those who came back with us , and we found them very delightful companions . We landed at Boston on a marvelous day , February 24 , 1919 . Gov . Calvin Coolidge and his stuff escorted us through the cheering throngs to Me  --  chanics ' Hull . This reception almost equaled those abroad  --  perhaps not so picturesque , but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd grew quiet , only to break out again when he heartily endorsed the League of Nations . My husband was deeply gratified by this . If Boston was a rep  --  resentative audience , the pulse of the nation beat steady and true for what . the President was working to attain . In response to Governor Coolidge 's introduction , the President made a vigorous address and got a real ovation when he finished . A review of news  --  paper comment indicated that Bos  --  ton 's enthusiastic reception expressed the preponderant sentiment of the na  --  tion . On reaching Washington , the first thing my husband did was to in  --  vite the Foreign Relations committees of the Senate and the House to meet with him at the White House . At that conference he discussed the rough draft of the Covenant , which had been accepted as a part of the treaty , and asked for any and all comments and suggestions . Many were made , and all thoroughly talked over . As a whole , they were not , I think , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NI ; limitted to him in writing , so he would have them in proper shape . When the meeting was over , he told me , as nearly as I can remember , the following : That he had addressed himself to Senator Lodge , of Massachusetts , say  --  ing : " Of course you understand , sen  --  ator , I will have to go buck to Paris and resubmit this to the conference , for while it is not essentially changed , it is not what they accepted the day I left ; and I have some pretty stubborn men to deal with . However , I am going to do my best. , and if this draft as it stands is accepted , do you think it will go through the Senate ? " Mr. Lodge replied : " If the Foreign Relations Committee approves it , I feel there is no doubt of ratification . " " Very well , then , " my husband an  --  swered , " I consider that , armed with your approval , I can go back and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Lodge bowed his head in assent . As I now look back over twenty years and review the words of Senator Lodge ? " If the Foreign Relations Committee approves it , I feel there is no doubt of ratification " ? I read into it a very subtle difference from its ap  --  parent rimming . Certainly the facts justify the impression that he already intended to block ratification , in the committee and on the floor , for he at  --  tacked the League in it speech two days later and a few other senators chimed in . Nevertheless , us far as anyone could judge at the time , this opposition did not represent the sentiment of thc country . Mr. William Howard Taft had just finished a long speaking tour in favor of the League , and believed the people were for it . The press of the country confirmed this opinion . On the night of our return departure for Paris the President answered his critics in a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York . I have heard that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft interrupted a vacation ordered by his physician , to preside . The former President took up the objections to the League one by one , refuting them so masterfully that my husband after  --  ward told one he wondered what would be left for him to say . The reception given my husband exceeded that in Boston , which , after a week of sniping at the League , was doubly heartening . When the band struck up Over There , he said that he would not come back " until it is over , over there , " and when he did come back he would bring a League Covenant that the American people could continue to support . Behind the Scenes As soon as the President had finished speaking , Mr. Cleveland 1/ . ' Dodge , Woodrow 's lifelong friend and class  --  mate , and I made our way backstage . We found my husband facing Mr Tumulty and looking very grim for on who had just received such a heart  --  warming ovation . " No , " he was say  --  ing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that time the rest of them want to come , I will receive them ; if not , I will go to the dock . " What had happened was this . The President had been asked to receive a group of Irish-American leaders who wished to present a paper . He had con  --  sented to do so , with the proviso that Daniel F. Cohalan should not accom  --  pany them . During the vrtri. , Cohalan had been a great disturber . Never  --  theless , the committee had shown up , headed by Cohalan . Tumulty was urg  --  ing the President to relent . " Oh , gov  --  governor , " he pleaded , " this will make a Continued an Page 861 8ti ( Continued from Page 84 terrible impression on his followers . " Cohalan was an influential political leader . The President took out his watch . " That 's just . what I want it to do , Tumulty , but I think it will make a good impression on decent . people . " It was then of ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tumulty re  --  luctantly departed on his errand , and in less than five minutes lie was show  --  ing in the committee minus their leader . As such things often happen , being leaderless. the mission stood awkward and embarrassed , and though my husband tried to put them at their ease , his eyes were blazing- at the trick they had tried to perpetrate by having this man run in at the last moment . They soon slunk away , and we imme  --  diately left for the steamer , having to run to get aboard in time . Mr. Dodge was so emotional that he kissed me good-by , saying : " God bless you for taking care of this great man that the world needs . ' . As on the previous voyage , marines patrolled the deck outside the windows of our rooms , marching back and forth , day and night , with their guns ready for use . It was monotonous and deadly dull work . One night I was awake and , missing the even sound of the feel that had become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very young boy leaning against the rail , with gull at rest , sound asleep . " Poor fellow , " I thought , " let him sleep . " Just then I saw , at the other end of the deck , the officer approach on his round or inspec  --  tion . I knew that if the boy were dis  --  covered asleep , the penalty would be severe : also that if I spoke to awaken him the officer would hear . So quickly I gave a loud attempt at a sneeze , which had the desired effect . The young marine jumped , seized his gun , and like a machine operated by a spring , re-slimed his mar  --  h . The officer along and said kindly : " Not catching cold , are you , soldier ? " The Turning Point Back on the ship , my husband was as happy as a boy . We used to walk I he deck together . " It is beyond human power to satisfy everyone , " he would say . " So the &est; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange as that may seem ; for only so , with give and take , can we come to an agree  --  ment . As the United States wants nothing , we are in a wonderful posi  --  tion , but by the same token my task is harder , because all these oppressed peo  --  ple look to me to fight for them . God knows I wish I could give them all they hope for , but only He himself could do that . " The usual official party came aboard at Brest , and among them we were sur  --  prised to see Colonel House . My hus  --  band said that if I would do the cour  --  tesies to the French people , he would go to his compartment and talk to Colonel House and get in touch with what had been done at the conference while he had been away . I look back on that moment as a crisis in his life , and feel that from it dated the long years of illness , due to overwork , and that with the wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that have demoralized the world . The welcoming officials said their speeches and departed . Passengers went to bed . My husband and Colonel House talked on while I waited in my adjoining stateroom . It was after mid  --  night when I heard my husband 's door THE SATURDAY open and the Colonel take his leave . I opened the door connecting our rooms . Woodrow was standing . The change in his appearance shocked me . He seemed to have aged ten years , and his jaw was set in that way it had when he was making superhuman efforts to control himself . Silently he held out his hand , which I grasped , crying : " What is the matter ? What has happened ? " My husband smiled bitterly . " House has given away everything I had won before we left Paris . He has com  --  promised on every side , and so I have to start all over again , and this time it will lie harder , as he has given the im  --  pression that my delegates are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his compromises is that , with a hostile press in the United States ex  --  pressing disapproval of the League of Nations as a part of the treaty , he thought it best to yield some other points , lest the conference withdraw its approval altogether . So he has yielded until there is nothing left . " I was speechless , knowing the fact to be that the great majority of the press was for the League . Bursting with in  --  dignation , I stood holding my hus  --  band 's hand . Before I got , myself together , he threw back his head . The light of battle was in his eyes . " Well , " he said , " thank God I can still fight , and I 'll win them back or never look these boys I sent over here in the face again . They lost battles , but won the war , bless them . So do n't be too dis  --  mayed . " We sat down and talked until early morning . Back in Paris , this time in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without an hour 's delay , lay about him to win back what . Colonel House had surrendered . The chief com  --  promise yielded by the Colonel af  --  fected the League of Nations , which now was in danger of being dropped from the treaty and pushed off into the vague future . Many insiders thought the League dead . Culling Mr. Ray SLannard Baker to the house , Mr. Wil EVENING POST sun issued , through him , a. statement to the press  --  dispassionate , but unmis  --  takable and firm : " The decision made at the Peace Conference in its plenary session , January 25 , 1919 , to the effect that the establishment . of the League of Nations should be made an integral part of the treaty of peace is of final force , and there is no basis whatever for the reports that a change in this de  --  cision was contemplated . " The statement caused a sensation . " All to do over again , " my husband had said to me on the night we arrived . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the English papers had taken up the cause of the opposi  --  tion to a moderate , workable peace , and to the League . Partisan opposition was increasing at home . In addition to his fight to keep the Covenant of the League in the treaty , the President had also to procure amendments to that in strument to allay critical opinion at home . Not all this critical opinion was hostile . The President was in communi  --  cation , by letter and by cable , with Mr. Taft , whose attitude was helpful and understanding . He believed some of the changes advocated by friendly home critics in truth unnecessary , but lie urged their acceptance to strengthen the League 's case in the face of the hostile opposition . To satisfy home demands without impairing the League 's structure was one task . Another was to meet foreign opposition , particularly that of cynivid old Clemenceau . Sessions. lasted fur into the night . The President grew thin and gray , but there was no resisting his determined purpose . Under this ter  --  rific ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not a severe at  --  tack of grippe laid him low , the fight would have gone on without respite . When the dread disease struck , there was little reserve to light with . He was too ill to rise from his bed . However , things were at such a crisis that lie would not relax his personal hold . ' rak  --  ing advantage of the President 's di  --  lemma , Clemenceau had pressed his January 511 , 1939 demand for an uncollectible sum of reparations , and the Italians their claim to Fiume . The President op  --  posed both . With these great interlocked ques  --  tions hanging fire , Mr. Wilson sent word that unless Clemenceau , George and Orlando were afraid of the disease , he wanted them to meet in his room , as usual . This they did , while Doctor Grayson and I sat outside fum  --  ing , for the President was sapping every drop of vitality left . Then came a night of burning fever . Finding the chest was involved , Doctor Grayson forbade further work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly spent , fitfully asleep . Getting better , the President insisted on knowing what had gone forward while he had been incapacitated . Alas , his absence had been again taken ad  --  vantage of . The news that came to him was so grave that we trembled for the result . But instead of causing a re  --  lapse , it stiffened his will . Silently I sat beside his lied . At length , he said : " 1/ : - . all the rest . of the delegates have deter  --  mined on this , I will not he a party to it . If I have lost my fight , which I would not have done had I been on my feet , I will retire in good order ; so we will go home . Call Grayson for me , please . " di Paris Battleground When Admiral Grayson came in , the President said : " Grayson , I wish you would send word to Captain Mc  --  Cauley that I want the George Wash  --  ington put in shape at once for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to make the trip . " As soon as the news got out , the beads of commissions began rushing t our house , consternation written o their faces . From a standpoint . of health , Doctor Grayson felt it unwise for the President to see them . As my husband was now eager to get away as soon as possible , lie accepted the suggestion of his phy  --  si  --  lan . Though it was riot done for that reason , this had the effect of further exciting the conference . Failing to see the President , statesmen , big and little , began to write him letters , beg  --  ging him to remain and holding out hopes for an adjustment of conflicting views , Clemenceau , Lloyd George and Orlando , for all their aggressive desires to get everything for their own coun  --  tries , gave proof that they respected and trusted Mr. Wilson ; particularly was this true of Orlando . Once more it was plainly demonstrated that without the President and the light he was making for a just peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise . The small nations looked to him as their one hope . Mr. Wilson did not want , or intend , to leave Paris if there was still a fighting chance for terms he could sanction . So the order regarding the George Washington was rescinded . Within a. few days the amendments to the League Covenant were adopted . Mr. David H. Miller , legal adviser to the American Commission , has left an account of one of the meetings at which this occurred . I will quote Mr. Miller . " At the close of the debate , President Wilson replied to the French in all extempore speech ? of witching elo  --  quence  --  a speech made after midnight , which left the secretaries gasping with admiration , their pencils in their hands , their duties forgotten , and hardly a word taken down .
