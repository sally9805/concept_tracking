Anyone delighted by the richness of British character could find it served up on a heaping platter in the House of Commons last week , steaming with honest emotion , thick with puzzlement , piquant with paradox and much like the late Diamond Jim Brady 's favorite fish sauce which was so good that " if you poured some of it over a turkish towel , you could eat it all . " Epicures for this sort of dish , Edward of Wales and the Soviet Ambassador sat down , elbow-to-elbow , just above the House of Commons ' clock . <P> A stinking piece of fish indeed lay beneath the sauce . At home and overseas the nation was seized by a conviction that in the behavior of His Majesty 's Government there were elements of treachery , cowardice and stupidity . This was an impression created by the building up of layer on layer of popular impressions . <P> Traditionally the Conservatives headed by Stanley Baldwin are the Party in the United Kingdom least sympathetic to the League of Nations . A nationwide peace ballot proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic to the League . When as Prime Minister it became Stanley Baldwin 's object to win the General Election , his outstanding campaign move was to convince the electorate that the Baldwin Cabinet and the Conservative Party had become highly sympathetic to the League . They had not only become highly sympathetic , but they also gave the further impression that if they won the election they would bend every effort to securing a major triumph for Geneva by contriving ' ' through the League of Nations " to main tain the independence and territorial integrity of Ethiopia . Strong was the popular impression that no solution which did not remove the last Italian soldier from Ethiopian soil would be countenanced by His Majesty 's Government . <P> The election was won . Shortly afterward " The Deal " to make peace by dismembering Ethiopia was agreed to in Paris by British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) . It was approved by the entire Baldwin Cabinet . It was officially presented at Geneva by the British Minister for League of Nations Affairs , Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the Ethiopian Government by the chiefs of the French and British diplomatic missions , together with urgent advice that it be accepted by Haile Selassie and Benito Mussolini . It was published as a White Paper with the imprimatur of King George . Was this treachery to voters who believed His Majesty 's Government had pledged themselves to act otherwise ? <P> The Deal was concluded only after weeks of British resistance and only after Italian threats to attack British war boats in the Mediterranean were common knowledge . In consenting to the dismemberment of Ethiopia while being threatened by Mussolini , were His Majesty 's Government cowards ? <P> When the moral stench against them grew insupportable . His Majesty 's Government accepted the resignation of Sir Samuel Hoare last week , although he had done nothing except on their prior instructions and with their subsequent approval . In sheltering themselves by means of a scapegoat were His Majesty 's Government cowards ?
