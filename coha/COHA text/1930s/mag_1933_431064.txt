 | My Mixed Marriage Condensed from The Atlantic Monthly George E. Sokolsky Recently I heard a clergyman and a rabbi debate on the everlasting subject of intermarriage- miscegenation , the elect like to call it . The clergyman was for it , the rabbi against it . It was impossible for me not to be facetious . " What , " I asked , " do these gentlemen , who have married their own kind , really know about intermarriage ? Do they know the unspoken thoughts of those who have crossed national and racial and even color barriers ? Do they appreciate the problem of the child ? " Well might I ask such questions , for mine is the most mixed of marriages . My wife is Chinese . My own people are Polish Jews . My wife was born in a British colony and educated in England ; her cultural heritage is British . I was brought up on the East Side of New York , and educated in New York 's public school system until I went to Columbia University . We met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three years we debated the question of mixed marriages Three years we argued our prospects of success . We had nothing in common except an affection for and a faith in each other . Could such a marriage succeed ? Everyone said it must fail . Shall I ever forget how a kindly friend sat before me for hours recounting the probabilities of failure ? " If you do not succeed in life , " he said , " your friends will say that it is your Chinese wife who keeps you down . And you may come to believe it . If you succeed , you may not be willing to admit that a Chinese wife helped you . " Then we were married-she , Chinese , Christian , British ; I , Polish , Jewish , American . Ten years have now passed , and we have both reached the same conclusion : that marriage is essentially a matter of readjustment-the more sensitive the individuals , the more delicate the readjustments . The elements which make for success or failure in a mixed marriage are primarily those which determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice , brutality , deceit - these make for failure in any marriage . The " mixed " characteristic plays no part here .  | Of course in a mixed marriage there are special stresses . Most marriages between a Chinese and a " white " woman have been unsuccessful because the problem is seriously complicated by the intricacies of the Chinese family system . The wife finds that she has to adjust herself to her husband 's relatives , to his mother in particular . If she lives with the family - the usual practice in China - she faces problems of differing customs and habits , to which she may never adapt herself . If her husband was married in childhood , as often happens , and he has failed to tell her about it , she soon discovers that his people look upon her as a concubine , and treat her according to that status . If she lives a Western life , she is often too expensive . If the father is paying the bills of the entire family , as Chinese fathers not infrequently do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Environmental differences do make adjustments more difficult in mixed marriages . But failure comes more often from deceit and ignorance than from any inability of races to blend . American girls who marry Chinese students often imagine that their husbands are wealthy . One Chinese boy , when he was a student in this country , gave the impression that he was a prince , and the American girl who married him was shocked to discover in Shanghai that he was only another young man looking for a job . Deception , poverty , and disappointment wrecked that marriage , but in such cases it is not the mixture , it is the lies , that make for failure . In a mixed marriage there can not be the usual traditions . You start out by trying carefully to make up your mind just how much you can take over of your partner 's attitude toward life . There may be such fundamental questions to decide as that of table manners , the precedence of husband or wife , the handling of family money , the attitude toward relatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband may not understand his wife 's expenditure of money to help old friends in need . He may apply the rule of " every man for himself , " while she applies the social concept of group responsibility . Such differences in tradition must be met and solved . But the most pressing problem in every intermarriage is the child . Not only does he face the possibility of a confused home training , a drawing hither and thither in education and religion , but he encounters a sentimental prejudice among other children , and even adults , which may develop in him a racial in-  | feriority complex so deep as to ruin his personality . His greatest danger comes during puberty when he may grow to hate his parents for having involved him in confusion , and , later , his first love affair may leave him with psychological scars that never heal . As we faced this problem , we were well aware , even before the child came to us , that the task of bringing him up would involve a large measure of character building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal pride so that he might withstand the buffets of a prejudiced world . We felt that our bay would have a more even chance in life if he were to develop artistic traits . In the rough competition of business or politics , his racial origin would surely prove an impediment . In the arts , nothing really matters but ability . Who cares that Fritz Kreisler is an Austrian , or that Paul Robeson is a Negro ? In the arts there is genuine democracy . Yet no parent can say to his child , " My boy , go forth and practice the arts . " The hidden qualities of genius , the lust for music , for color , for words - these must dawn within the consciousness of each individual . What fathers and mothers can do , however , is to be vigilant , providing the child with an atmosphere and environment to stimulate whatever talents he may possess . The first duty of the parents is to make the child realize from infancy that there is nothing extraordinary about him . The recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commencing with the time when the child begins to ask questions , when he notices the difference between blond hair and black , patiently , carefully , the story of his racial origin should be unfolded to him-not nationalistically , not as a problem , but as a story in which he is an incidental character . The heroine of such a tale should be his mother . That attitude will strengthen his faith in her and in himself . He will feel that it is quite all right to have come out of her race . It will not matter what others say-he will know better . As the child grows older he can not help noticing that in many respects he is not like other children . Then it is that sympathy and understanding on the part of parents must play the role of corrective . He must not be coddled because he is different . He must learn that all human beings face special problems . Some are too rich , others too poor . Some are too beautiful , others too ugly . Some are lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden so that it  | does not become an impediment . Above all , one must not make the burden the principal concern in life , so that nothing matters but to carry it . This explanation must come to the child at an early age , before some unsympathetic nurse or some ridiculous relative spoils the picture . With our boy , I find it easy to point out that a friend of his is very good-looking but has no money . " That is too bad , " I say . " Maybe he wo n't be able to go to a good school . Well , you do n't always have everything . For instance , there is the little girl in the next block who has two fathers , one in New York and the other in Baltimore . She likes her father in Baltimore better because he was her first father . But he went away , and her mother got her another . Well , you ca n't always arrange these things . Still , you 're pretty lucky . You can go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . But you will not always have everything you want , and maybe there will be some trouble for you some day . You have to be a pretty good fellow to stand up under trouble . Good fellows shake off troubles . " If there is a genuine religious difference between the partners of a mixed marriage , their children are pretty certain to grow up in an unhappy environment . In our case , we have decided to tell the boy that he is a Jew , but to make no fuss about it . Jews who " pass " to some more popular religious group do not solve any problems by mere dissembling . The easiest way to avoid the suspicion of imposture is to stand up as you are . If , later in life , the child of a mixed religious marriage wants to choose for himself , that is another matter , but the lot of an Episcopal Cohen is too trying to wish on any child . I have tried to deal with intermarriage unemotionally . There have been tragic failures ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my advice . She wanted a page out of my experience . I could only tell her what I have written here . Then I added : " If you were to marry the boy who sat next to you at college , you might be happy , and then again you might be the one who , out of every six or seven , is divorced . If you marry this man ( an East Asian ) because of novelty , it will wear off . If you love him and he loves you , then allow yourself a sure interval before you have a child . If , after that interval , you still love each other , go ahead and rear a family . " But would that advice not also apply to marriages which do not involve racial , cultural , or religious differences ?
