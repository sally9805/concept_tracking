One morning last week Secretary Ickes decided to have a look at his Interior Department . At random he walked down a corridor in his shirt sleeves and poked his head into an office . A young man was sitting with his feet on a desk reading a newspaper . <P> " Is that the way you work ? " asked Mr. Ickes . " I do n't do that myself . " <P> " And who in the hell are you ? " asked the employe innocently . <P> Into another office popped the Secretary and found a man who had taken off his white shoes and was cleaning them . In another he found two girls playing dominoes . He stopped to talk to the soft drink concessionaire who , without recognizing him , admitted that he did a good business because people could loaf a while at his stand . Mr. Ickes turned up at the cafeteria next morning shortly after 8 o'clock and found 100 or more employes still eating breakfast. * <P> Thoroughly upset by what he found on his tour of inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department auditorium one sweltering afternoon . Those who could not crowd in stood in the corridors and listened by loud speaker . Said Secretary Ickes : <P> " I do n't want you to take me for a scolding stepfather . I have failings myself and try to understand others . In the last week ... I passed certain divisions and my heart was warmed by the air of activity . . . which they exuded . I passed others where employes were reading papers and still others where feet were on the desks . . . . <P> " I always have had an aversion to gentlemen-and this applies to ladies also - sitting with their feet on desks . I know that some , in defense of the proclivity , say they can think better , but I wonder what they are thinking with . <P> " I could cite one instance where six gentlemen were sitting with twelve feet on the desks apparently having a gorgeous time . <P> " And personally I like to remember the days when women no more thought of putting on their make-up than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was such a rush of unbranded mavericks at 3:30 that they knocked down a woman on the staff and were in such a hurry that no one stopped to pick her up . Let 's add on 30 or 45 seconds to get outside and refrain from committing mayhem on the unwilling body of any individual . <P> " Please give me full time for full pay , " he concluded and looked at his watch . It was not yet 3 o'clock . " And now all Public Works employes can go home for the day . " There were 6,893 loud and long ap-lauses . <P> &Instead; of using daylight saving time , the Interior Department goes to work at 8 a.m. , quits at 3:30 p.m. during the summer .
