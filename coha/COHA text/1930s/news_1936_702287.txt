Edgar Hoover , their chief , and 100 patrolmen and detectives surrounding the flat at 304 West 102d Street early this morning . For thirty-five minutes , after firemen trying to put out the blaze started by tear-gas bombs had been driven to cover , Brunette exchanged shots from a hall closet with the Federal men , armed with submachine guns , and the police , while the flames roared from furniture and draperies in the room in which he had been trapped . Bullets tore at the wall surrounding the closet from the stairway ? above and from the stoops of apart- ? ment houses across the street , where the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had outposts .

Not until his ammunition began to run low and the flames crept closer did Brunette surrender . At last , at 2:05 A. M. , after he had fired more than fifty rounds of ammunition , he came into the hall . At the sight of the forlorn figure , clad in a sweater and with a battered slouch hat perched on his head , his hands upraised in surrender , the firing stopped .

Detectives James Cotter and James O'Brien of the West 100th Street station received information from a girl living on West 106th Street that Brunette , for whom the FBI had sent out an alarm in the case , could be found at the 102d Street address . The G-men were notified and yesterday morning Mr. Hoover , director of the bureau , brought twenty-five agents to New York to effect the capture .

Mr. Hoover planted his operatives in the vicinity of the house and in the upper floors of the five-story apartment building in which Brunette 's apartment was on the ground floor .

The battle opened while the flames spread to furniture in the room at 1:30 o'clock . While radio cars and emergency wagons were speeding to the scene , firemen under Deputy Chief Lawrence Fischer , called on one alarm , came rolling into the block . Heedless of the situation , the firemen set up aerial ladders so that residents on the upper floors , if the flames got worse , would not be trapped . With this done , the burst of shots from the room and from the shelters of the agents forced them to seek cover in the vicinity while they watched the flames , unable to do anything to check them . When the flames had spread around the room so that he could no longer remain inside it , Brunette retreated to the hall outside , finding shelter in a closet just outside his door .
