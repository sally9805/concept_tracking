Tampa , cigarmaking gateway to Florida 's west coast , has a reputation for lawlessness and corruption entirely out of proportion to its population ( 100,000 ) . There one chilly November night nearly two years ago a police squad burst into a private home without benefit of warrants , seized the leaders of a tiny group of reformers , whisked them off to police headquarters where they were booked for " Communism . " They were released with alacrity . Three of them were then escorted to waiting automobiles , driven into the country , flogged , tarred , feathered and left in a swamp . One of them , Joseph A. Shoemaker , partially paralyzed , so mutilated that one leg had to be amputated , died nine days later . <P> Political Tampa had little expectation that the murderers would ever be punished . Backed by a potent roster of labor and liberal groups , Socialist Norman Thomas nevertheless set up a " Committee for the Defense of Civil Rights in Tampa . " Eleven men , including the police chief , were indicted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floggings fell , jumped or was pushed to his death from the window of a Tampa hospital . A onetime justice of the peace also at police headquarters that night died suddenly and mysteriously . A Tampa Ku Klux Klansman implicated in the case was declared a suicide , though his wife called it murder . <P> The first trial , held under a change of venue in the little town of Bartow about 48 miles east of Tampa , was a broad education to Northern reporters , particularly representatives of the radical Press . Wires were tapped , rooms searched , frame-up attempted . At least one had the novel experience of being shadowed in his leisure moments by the defendants , who were free on bail . Presiding Judge was Robert T. Dewell , a corpulent Yaleman ( Class of 1911 ) , who was overwhelmed with appeals for impartiality from fellow Yalemen in the North . Five defendants were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping . <P> On appeal the Florida State Supreme Court threw out the convictions on the ground that evidence on a conspiracy count had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , this time on charges of second-degree murder , opened in Bartow last fortnight . Following the dictates of the higher court Judge Dewell ruled out all evidence leading up to the time the victims were released at the police station . Thus the prosecution had to build its case on the recollections of the two survivors , Eugene F. Poulnot , head of the Florida Workers ' Alliance , and Samuel R. Rogers , a onetime physician who now practices tree surgery .
