At the age when the average U. S. moppet is getting a tricycle from Santa Claus , the average Norwegian child is getting a pair of skis . In Norway children start to ski when they are 4 , can usually jump 60 ft. when they are 8 and 150 ft. when they are 12 . To encourage the sport , the Norwegian Ski Association each year gives 5,000 pairs of skis to children who can not afford to buy them . <P> So it is not surprising that the best ski jumpers in the world are developed in Norway . Last week , when 9,000 ski enthusiasts gathered in the little town of Brattleboro , Vt. to witness the ski-jumping championship of the U. S. , the entry list looked like an Oslo telephone directory . Sprinkled among the Class A competitors were a few native Americans but the majority were Norwegians sojourning in the U. S. A dozen or so were topflight , but the performer the crowd had really come to see was Birger Ruud , the No. 1 product of Norway 's extraordinary ski-training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping mouths it watched jumper after jumper slant through the air-eight with leaps of over 200 ft. - but it was 130-lb . Birger Ruud who made the spectators gasp with his prodigious and perfect jump of 216 ft. , a whizzing arc ending with the wood slapping evenly on the hard snow . <P> It broke the hill record by 19 ft. and clinched the championship with a total of 229.8 points ( based on best distance and form in two jumps ) . Six out of the first ten placed were Ruud 's countrymen . <P> Winning championships is an old story to Birger Ruud . Olympic jumping champion twice ( 1932 and 1936 ) , and world champion thrice , he has competed in 200 meets , placed 190 times , won no times , broken 50 records . His older brother , Sigmund , won the U. S. championship while on a visit last year and placed fifth last week . The Brothers Ruud are-next to Sonja Henie-Norway 's greatest athletic pride . Born in a little silver-mining town of Kongsberg near Oslo , which has produced more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little Birger Ruud won his first championship when he was seven years old . Since ski jumping is a matter of confidence and body control , Birger Ruud , like all Kongsberg children , supplemented winter jumping with summertime diving to keep in trim and help develop good technique . The Ruuds have a younger brother , Asbjorn , 18. who has already outjumped Birger . This is Birger 's second visit to the U. S. and this trip is his honeymoon . When asked if he can speak English , his answer is " a little . " Those two words are practically the limit of his English vocabulary .
