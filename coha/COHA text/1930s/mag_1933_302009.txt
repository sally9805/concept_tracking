No Federal Reserve System has Canada . Nor has she thousands of small banks like the U.S. Instead she has but eleven big banks with 3,500 branches scattered the breadth of the country . <P> Half a century ago , Canada passed a law requiring that her banking statutes should be inspected and overhauled every ten years . They were so overhauled in 1880 , 1890 , 1900 , 1913 , 1923 . Due again to be revised this year , they were fuller than ever before of political dynamite . Battered by Depression , Canada was ripe for change . Her prairie provinces , after years of low grain prices and inspired by the New Deal across the border , were ready for political revolt . The C.C.F. ( Cooperative Commonwealth Federation , nicknamed " Cocofed " ) , a radical organization not unlike the U.S. Farmer-Labor Party , was preparing to raise hob . Canada 's banks had stood unharmed through the Depression , but the West was bitter against them for not lending more money at lower rates . Bank scandals in the U.S. prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposals were made for " nationalization of credit " to take the power of making loans away from the banks , turn it over to the Government . <P> Rather than draw a new banking act under such circumstances , Canada 's conservative Premier Bennett got the Canadian Parliament before the end of its record 7-month session to renew Canadian bank charters for one year , postpone a new banking law until next session . He promised during the Parliamentary recess to have a special commission study Canada 's banking , currency and coinage . Last week that commission was at work in Western Canada . <P> First a day 's session was held at Victoria , then a two-day session at Vancouver . The Government of British Columbia asked politely that the banks should be more liberal in their loans , asked that the province and cities should be allowed to borrow directly from the Dominion instead of through the banks . Some businessmen complained that loans were hard to get , because they must be approved by bank officers in the East . Bankers denied this and representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decorum was preserved until an Irish-Canadian barrister , Gerald Grattan McGeer , K.C .. representing the Vancouver Trades &; Labor Council , got the floor . For three and one-half hours he harangued the Commission , lambasted Canadian banking as a " credit racket ' ' which was strangling commercial life . He told the Commission that it was " trying to patch up an oxcart instead of buying an automobile " ( i.e. nationalizing credit ) . <P> The hearings were Canada 's equivalent of the U.S. Senate 's bank investigating show , but they promised to be a far different kind of affair . After Parliament adjourned in May Premier Bennett , rich and pious Anglophile , often mentioned as candidate for a British peerage , was in London at the Economic Conference . There he got a famed Scotsman to head his banking commission : Hugh Pattison MacMillan , Baron of Aberfeldy .
