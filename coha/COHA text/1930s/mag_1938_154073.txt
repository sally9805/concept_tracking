First reports of a devastating fire in one of the many Leftist munitions plants established in Barcelona 's suburbs leaked out of Spain last week through Perpignan , France . The fire and the resulting explosions were said to have killed 400 persons . Many workmen , thinking an air raid was on , took refuge in the plant 's basement , where they were smothered . There was a hint that a Rightist espionage agent had been responsible for a telling blow to the Leftist munitions supply . Another version was that a careless laborer simply dropped an explosive shell . <P> The news having reached the outside world despite the vigilance of Leftist censors , the Leftist Ministry of National Defense next day saw fit to issue a statement " correcting " the report of widespread damage and huge casualties . Correction : only four were killed , only 19 injured , the material damage was slight . New York Timesman Herbert L. Matthews , who investigated the fire on the spot but was unable to cable the details abroad , agreed with this version . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
