Last week gloom enveloped Camp LaGuardia ( for homeless men ) in Orange County , N. Y. Reason : the 60 pedigreed rabbits , which New York City 's Department of Health entrusted to the campers for breeding purposes last fall , had produced only 100 bunnies suitable for the municipal culture of pneumonia serum , thus blighting the department 's hopes of shaving its annual $24,000 rabbit bill . Said Chief Rabbit-Keeper William Hodson , commissioner of Public Welfare : " I have been feeding them almost nothing but hormone extracts . <P> They are a disgrace . " At the same time enthusiasm marked the 40th convention of the Society of American Bacteriologists in San Francisco . For 38-year-old Dr. Walther Frederick Goebel of the Rockefeller Institute Hospital announced that he had produced artificially a successful pneumonia antigen . ( An antigen is a substance which stimulates the organism to produce antibodies ; a serum is a blood constituent in which antibodies have already been produced . ) The Goebel antigen is a combination of egg white and an acid obtained by complicated treatment of cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) with water . <P> Large-scale production of the antigen , agreed the enthusiastic bacteriologists , would be cheap , simple and eliminate the necessity of using rabbits .
