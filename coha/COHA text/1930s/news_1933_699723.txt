txt Pullman Economies . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Pullman Company is working the " economy racket " overtime . Riding on the New York Central train No. 6 , from Chicago to New York , today , it was noted in the car I occupied that between time of departure and 8:30 P. M. only one towel was permitted on each of four racks in the washroom at any one time , and these , naturally , were promptly used up . Having occasion to dry my hands during the afternoon and finding no towel , I rang for the porter , who , in response to my request , pointed to a box on the wall bearing the label of a paper towel and said that the customers were supposed to use that . Until the Pullman Company sees its way clear to pass on to its patrons some of the savings accomplished by such ulterior practices , I refuse to participate in their economy move .
