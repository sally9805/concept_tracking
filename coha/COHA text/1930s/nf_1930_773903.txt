txt // per cent drop in voltage . This holds true up to about ten per cent voltage drop , and there is a corresponding increase of about three and one-half per cent for voltages above normal up to a voltage rise of about ten per cent . This relation , as well as those between potential , and efficiency , power , current and resistance , is shown in Fig. 21 . It is interesting to note that the curve of per cent lu mens with per cent voltage follows rather closely the equation 1 y = 3.79x2 ? 3.97x + 1.18 . The variation in life with voltage is about fourteen per cent for each one per cent above or below normal ; however , this figure holds only for small variations , be-coming greater with decreasing voltage and less with increasing . With the series or constant-current type of lamp , the effect of current variation on the life and lumens output of the lamp is of chief importance . For instance , a one per cent change from normal current causes approximately a six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent change in life . The conse consequences resulting from variation of the voltage or current and the great importance of correct adaptation of the lamps to the circuit conditions and of the proper maintenance of constant rated volt-age or current are evident . For standard lighting service , nearly all lamps are rated as for 110 , 115 , or 120 volts , with a tendency to standardization on the 115-volt rating , which gives its name to the class . They are also made to a limited extent , less than three per cent , for voltages from 220 to 250 , and in increasing numbers for 30 volts , all gas-filled , to be used on so-called country-home or farm-lighting systems , and for 32 and 64 volts for train lighting . For projection work the gas-filled lamps are made with a filament concentrated into a par ticularly small space . They run at an efficiency higher than that of any other incandescent lamp , and consequently , as stated above , have a shorter life , 50 to 800 hours , depending upon the kind of projection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sizes up to 1000 watts for 110 volts . An especially efficient lamp for motion-picture work requires 30 amperes at 30 volts . The lamps so far considered are known as " large " lamps to dis tinguish them from miniature lamps , which are now made by the // millions and are used largely for automobiles , for flash lights , and for signal lights , though great numbers are used for other purposes . They are all of relatively low voltage , and range from about % candle power , as used for some medical instruments to 32 candle power frequently used for automobile headlights . The 21 candle power size is generally used for the latter purpose . ' The smaller , miniature lamps are of the vacuum type , but the larger ones are gas-filled . All of the tungsten lamps have practically identical characteristics on direct and on alternating current . ' In closing this treatment of incandescent lamps , a brief discus-sion of the economics of the subject will be in order . The fact has already been mentioned that an incandescent lamp may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate it , and also that a carbon-filament lamp can never , under normal conditions , be used economically . The cost of light per lumen-hour furnished by a lamp is determined as follows . The lamp is assumed to burn a certain number of hours , t , and to give an average lumen output of L , during that period , and to have an average cost for power of C cents per hour . Also that the cost of the lamp is c cents . Then the total output will be the product of lumens and hours or Lt lumen-hours . The energy input will be the product of watts and hours or Ct . The total cost of the light output will be the sum of the cost of power and the cost of the lamp or Ct + c . Thus the cost per 1000 lumen-hours will be the total cost , divided by the lumen-hours over 1000 , or Next compare the cost of light using a carbon-filament lamp with that using a 25-watt tungsten-filament lamp . Assume a life of 1000 hours for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 0.01 cent per watt-hour . The carbon lamp might cost 10 cents , and give 200 lumens for a consumption of 60 watts . Its power cost during its life would then be 60 X 1000 X 0.01 = 600 cents or $6.00. // Adding the ten cents cost of the lamp and dividing by 200 gives the cost per 1000 lumen-hours as 3.05 cents . Expressed as an equa-tion this is The tungsten lamp costs say 23 cents and gives 200 lumens with a consumption of 24 watts . It should be remembered that these are average values during life and are , therefore , based on 87 per cent and 91 per cent respectively of the initial lumen and efficiency values . The cost of power for this lamp is 24 X 0.01 X 1000 = 240 or $2.40 . Adding the cost of the lamp , 23 cents , and dividing by 200 gives 1.32 cents per 1000 lumen-hours . The equation for this is A little figuring will show that a considerable bonus would have to be given with the carbon lamp to make the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same method is applied to determine at what point in its natural life a lamp should be taken out of service . The cost per 1000 lumen-hours is calculated on the assumption of a working life of say 500 hours , 600 hours , 700 hours , etc . At first , owing to the part played in the total cost by the cost of the lamp , these values decrease with increased length of service . This part , however , becomes smaller and smaller , while the lumens and the efficiency are decreasing . These conditions result eventually in a minimum point on the curve of cost with life . The life corresponding to this minimum is that at which the lamp should be taken out of service . Upon such calculations the standard life of 1000 hours for incandescent lamps is based . 29 . The Electric Arc . When a small break is made in an electric circuit carrying current , an arc tends to occur in the gap . Such an are was the basis of the first electric light , and is still an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other special applications of electric light . A certain minimum potential difference between the electrodes is necessary in order that even a very short arc may be maintained . With direct current this varies // from 36 volts I for carbon to 13 volts for mercury , but with alter-nating current the necessary voltage across the arc with the mer-cury arc runs up to 5600 . The arc will pass freely at a low voltage with the mercury as the negative 2 electrode but will not pass in the opposite direction until the higher voltage is reached . This phenomenon is shown in the curves in Fig. 22.3 It is made use of in the mercury rectifier.4 It will also be noticed that as the temperature of the arc decreases , this rectifying effect increases . The curves indi-cate further that carbon is the only one of the substances shown that can be used in an alternating-current arc . When the mercury arc is used on that system , it includes rectification and operates as a one-way arc . A stream of molecules is always leaving the negative electrode // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristic spectrum of the material and hence determine the color and light-giving properties of the are . Hence there is obtained , the mono-chromatic or one-color yellow-green of the mercury are and the white of the iron-titanium are , also known as the " magnetite " are . In each of these cases the positive electrode is of a material different from the negative , and the latter determines the color of the arc . The potential difference between are electrodes is made up of a con stant which is characteristic of the electrode material and which is approximately the minimum potential difference at which the are can be maintained , plus a part which is directly proportional to the length of the are and inversely proportional to the square root of the current through the are . ' Investigations of the theory of the are now being made ( 1929 ) are likely to modify this statement . Unlike a solid resistance , however , the are takes a smaller po tential difference as the current increases . Where arcs are op erated in series , and a constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , however , a constant potential is applied to such an arc , without other resistance in series with it , a short circuit ensues . Hence , where are lamps are operated in parallel on ordinary lighting circuits , it is necessary to use a resistance or inductance in series with the arc . This is called a " ballast . " 30 . Arc Lamps . Except in the case of the mercury-arc , at least one of the electrodes is consumed continually while the lamp is in operation . Therefore some device , either manual or automatic , must be provided for maintaining the electrodes at the proper dis tance apart . It is also necessary when starting the are to break contact between the electrodes . This process is called " striking the arc . " These two functions are performed by an electromagnet , the armature of which is connected , generally through a lever , with a clutch which grips and lifts either the electrode , or a rod which carries it . In the case of the series or constant-current lamp there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the circuit in case of the sticking of the electrode , or the occurrence of // any other accident which would open the circuit within the lamp . This mechanism and the circuit diagram . for the magnetite are are shown in Figs. 23 and 25 . Carbon arcs used for projection purposes are often hand operated . 31 . The Carbon Arc . The are between carbon electrodes , though now seldom used for ordinary illumination , is still the standard light-source for long-distance projection . The are-stream of such an arc is itself practically nonluminous , and the very efficient light which the are gives is due to the high temperature to which the carbon tips are raised by the current passing between them and the arc-stream . The positive electrode , in the case of a direct-current are , reaches a much higher temperature than the negative , ? about 3500 ? centigrade . It was this high temperature that was used for volatilizing the calcium fluoride or other salt used as a core or impregnating material in the flaming-arc lamps mentioned in ? 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 volts . While the current in arc-lighting cir-cuits seldom exceeded ten amperes , that used for projection pur-poses varies from 20 to 250 amperes , or even more . In the open // carbon are the electrodes are consumed rather rapidly by oxida-tion so that they must be replaced at intervals of only a few hours of operation . The are has the effect of hollowing the positive carbon into the form of a shallow cup , covering nearly the whole of the end of the electrode . This is known as the positive crater , on the surface of which the highest temperature is found . In projection work this whitehot surface is directed toward the lens or reHector so that a large fraction of the generated luminous flux is used ; to keep the negative electrode tip from cutting off the light emitted by the positive crater , the car- bons are set at an angle instead of in line with each other . 32 . The Magnetite or Luminous-Arc Lamp . This is the only are with solid electrodes that is at present in use for illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See ? 123 . ) Figure 23 shows the mechanism of a recent type of the magnetite are lamp and Figs. 24 and 25 , a complete lamp and the electrical connections . The negative electrode is made of a mixture of magnetite ( or magnetic oxide of iron ) , titanium oxide , and chromium oxide with a little flux . ' The titanium oxide is the principal light-giving constituent , and gives to the are a brilliant spectrum with many bands and lines well distributed throughout the entire visible // range . Thus the effect produced is that of a continuous spectrum closely approximating to average daylight or white light . The iron oxide is used to provide a base or medium of good conductivity , and the chromium oxide , to steady the are and reduce the rate of consumption of the electrode . By varying the proportions of these three constituents a wide range of life-efficiency values can be obtained . The present commercial range of efficiency for the 6.6-ampere lamp is from 20 to 26 lumens per watt ; by the use , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 125 to 225 hours per trim is obtained . The mixture of oxides is packed into thin steel tubes under great pressure as high , in some cases , as 200 tons per square inch ( 28,200 kilograms per square centimeter ) and then the round tubes are again pressed so as to give them a square cross section . The positive electrode is a relatively large copper rod , the temperature of which does not get very high . Thus nearly all the light comes from the arc-stream itself , which , because of the character of its spectrum , has the white appearance that has added so much to the popularity of this lamp for street lighting . The luminous character of the are also gives a good light distribution similar to that of the incandescent lamp . The fact that the upper electrode is consumed so slowly makes the location of the are in the globe nearly stationary . It thus facilitates the use of light-directing devices , such as prismatic refractors and small aluminum reflectors , which are placed just above the arc . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp must be operated on a direct-current circuit . This is usually provided for by a combination of a transformer , which changes the usual constant potential alternating-current supply to a constant current , and a mercury rectifier , which then changes the alternating current to a direct current . 33 . The Mercury-Arc Lamp . Although the mercury are is entirely inclosed in a glass tube and consumes very little of the electrode material , it is nevertheless a true are . The tube , having had the air exhausted and the mercury introduced , is filled with mercury vapor at very low pressure . When the arc is operating , // the current is maintained by a stream of electrons or negative ions from the cathode or negative mercury pool to the anode or positive terminal . At the same time a lesser stream of positive ions is moving in general direction toward the cathode . Frequent collisions take place causing a multiplicity of paths , but the general direction of the flow is as stated . These phenomena are characteristic of the conduction of current through gases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool with such force that the temperature at the hot spot is raised to a point where the mercury is vaporized and , passing into the tube , forms a gaseous path for the are . The violence of the impact of the ions is also noted in the minute crater on the mercury surface at which the arc makes contact with it . The mercury-arc lamp consists of one or two glass tubes from 22 to 50 inches long ( 56 to 127 centimeters ) and generally one inch ( 22 centimeters ) in diameter . At the lower end is an enlarge-ment , which contains the negative electrode in the form of a pool of mercury , from which the lamp terminals conduct the current . The tube is fitted at the upper end with one or two positive elec-trodes of iron ; it is inclined about seven degrees from the horizon- // tal . An alternating-current lamp taking 450 watts and 3.8 amperes at 110 volts is shown in Fig. 26 . When the are is not passing , the vapor has a very high resistance ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the are . The simplest one is to tip the tube to a horizontal position . A thin stream of mercury running along the bottom then closes the cir cuit between the electrodes , and when this breaks , the are starts and stretches out between the ends of the tube as the lamp is tipped back into its operating position . The are may also be started by an induced high voltage discharge , which is the method most used at present . The high voltage needed to produce ignition and thus to start the mechanism of the arc-stream is obtained by suddenly breaking a current through a shunted coil having a high self-inductance . I This same coil is kept in series with the lamp dur ing operation and serves to steady the flow of current . The mag netically operated switch which performs the sudden opening of this circuit is itself a small mercury-arc tube in the lamp housing . When the lamp is not lighted , this tube is horizontal , so that its terminals are short-circuited by a thin thread or bridge of mercury along its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main tube , and also includes a magnet , which , when energized , tilts the starting tube out of its horizontal position . When the switch is closed , a current passes through the starting tube and through the tilting magnet . The latter revolves the starting tube around an axis at right angles to its length and thus breaks its mercury thread , the rupture of which very quickly opens the circuit . The presence of the self-inductance then causes a great rise in pressure across the main tube and thus starts the arc within it . Because these lamps have the usual volt-ampere characteristic of arcs and are always used on constant potential circuits , a ballast resistance , or in the case of alternating-current lamps , an induc tance coil is always provided . This inductance reduces the power-factor 2 to about 85 per cent . // For alternating current a double voltage autotransformer I is used with its middle point connected through the inductance to the negative terminal of the lamp . There are then two terminals at the upper end , one connected to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first one , then the other of these terminals becomes positive . Thus one is always positive relatively to the mercury , so maintaining the arc . It will be noted that this lamp is in reality a mercury-arc rectifier of special form . The wiring diagram for such a lamp is seen in Fig. 27 . The are fills the whole tube and on account of its great lightgiving area it affords a well-diffused light of low brightness . Its color is characteristic of the mercury spectrum , with its large predominance of yellow-green and with practically no light from the red end . Indeed it is almost monochromatic and has the advantages and disadvantages of such a light . Because of the optical characteristics of the eye such a monochromatic light // focuses more accurately than does white light and thus makes the images on the retina sharper . This gives an advantage to such a light for the observation of very fine detail . The predominance of the short wave-lengths in the mercury-arc light enables better vision in the case of very low light-intensities , either from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of both . On the other hand , the fact that all colors except green are more or less distorted and that red is practically absent is a serious handicap to the mercury light wherever the observation of color is of any importance . In many types of industrial lighting , how-ever , this color modification does not seriously affect the usefulness of the illumination , and this is the field in which this lamp finds its principal application . The fact that most of the radiation from the mercury are comes in that part of the spectrum to which the eye is most sensitive 1 increases the effectiveness of this lamp . As the light is strong in actinic radiation , z it is extensively used in photog raphy , in photographic reproduction , and in blue printing . Sev eral tubes are often mounted side by side in a frame . The commercial lamp is always equipped with a trough-shaped reflector having usually a white enamel interior . A fluorescent 3 red paint containing the substance rhodamin , has been used here , which , by increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red into the emitted light . The initial lumens given by the mercury-arc lamps , as manufac tured by the Cooper-Hewitt Electric Company , are 5970 for alternating current and 5500 for direct current ; the lumens per watt are 13.3 for the former and 14.3 for the latter . There is a decrease in the lumens to about 80 per cent at 2000 hours and to 68 per cent at 4000 hours.4 The direct-current lamp may be used on voltages of from 100 to 125 . The alternating-current lamp may be adjusted from 93 to 127 and from 186 to 254 volts . // A mercury-arc lamp in a tube made of quartz was introduced from England in 1910 . It was operated at a much higher tempera ture and with an efficiency of about 26 lumens per watt . It never came into general use as an illuminant , but on account of the large flux of ultra-violet light , I it has found a place as a laboratory source of such rays , and also for water sterilization , and therapeutic applications . The great interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a narrow band of radiation near 0.3 micron in the prevention and cure of the disease popularly known as " rickets " is adding to the importance of the quartz-tube mercury-arc. 2 34 . The Gas-Glow Lamp . When a high-voltage alternating potential is applied to terminals set into the ends of a tube contain ing a gas under a definite low pressure , a small current passed through the tube produces a glow which may be used as a source of light . The glow is of varying color depending on the gas used . Such lamps are also known as " gaseous conductor lamps . " The Moore-tube lamps mentioned in ? 23 contained nitrogen gas.3 The tubes were 1 inch ( 4.4 cm. ) in diameter and as much as 200 feet ( 61 meters ) long in some cases , and gave about 100 lumens per foot ( 330 lumens per meter ) of tube with a net efficiency of about 7 lumens per watt . It is stated that about four miles ( 6i km. ) of these tubes were installed . Shorter tubes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volts for such a lamp , which was obtained from an individual step-up transformer located close to it . The tube was usually mounted near the angle between the walls and ceiling . An ingenious device provided a continuous and reg ulated supply of nitrogen gas to the tube . The power-factor was about 75 per cent . The further extension of the use of this source of illumination was stopped by the advent of the tungsten lamps with their higher efficiency . When carbon dioxide is used in the tube , an efficiency of about half that with the nitrogen is obtained . The light , however , is then // a very close approximation to daylight . This formerly created a considerable market for these tubes in short lengths which operate at a low efficiency but give the quality of light desired for color matching in dye works and similar industries . Gas-filled incan descent lamps with blue glass filters are now generally used for this purpose . Neon gas , ' one of the rare atmospheric gases , is also used in this way . The color given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very satisfactory for general illumination . The striking character of the color however is making the neon tube increasingly important for use in electric signs , as described in ? 157 . To obtain the characteristic orange color of neon , this gas must have a very high degree of purity . An admixture of even one per cent of nitrogen for instance , will result in radiation completely dominated by the latter gas . Therefore especial care must be taken to eliminate the nitrogen and other gases contained in the walls of the enclosing tube . The voltage needed per unit length of these tubes is only from one-third to one-half that required for nitrogen tubes . Also the luminous flux is about 330 lumens per foot ( 1100 lumens per meter ) ; that is , about 33 times that of the nitrogen lamp . The lumens per watt are about 25 , making it one of the most efficient light-sources now in use . As in the case of the mer cury are , the monochromatic character of the neon light , both makes the lamp useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to distinguish fine details . ' Other colors of light may be obtained by combining gases and by the use of colored glass in the inclosing tubes . Thus blue may be obtained by a combination of mercury vapor with neon or argon gas , and green by the use of a greenish-yellow glass tube with one of the above combinations . Developments in this field are rapid and it seems probable that lights of other colors will come into use . 35 . The Low-Voltage Gas-Glow Lamp . The gaseous-con ductor lamps , hitherto considered , all require a very high voltage for their operation . It is thus necessary to provide special high-voltage transformers for them . D. McFarlan Moore , to whose // efforts , through a period of over thirty years , the development of gaseous-conductor lamps has been principally due , has succeeded in producing lamps of this type , which can be used in ordinary lamp sockets . These lamps promise to become important factors in some applications of light . Descriptions of several types of such lamps have been published . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illumination , one described by Mr. Moore in 1923 is perhaps the most promising . ' In general , when electric current is passed between two electrodes z through a rarefied gas , glows appear around each terminal . That around the negative terminal 3 appears at a lower voltage . The positive glow requires a higher voltage and gives much more light . The high-voltage lamps already described depend upon the positive glow . It is possible , however , by combining a very short starting distance between positive and negative electrodes for the initial generation of electrons with a relatively long path for the con tinuing operation of the lamp , to obtain at only 115 or 230 volts a considerable positive glow . In this lamp the principal positive electrode , which is tubular , has a much smaller negative starting electrode separated from it by only about - 614-  inch ( 2 millimeter ) while the principal negative terminal has a corresponding positive starting electrode . These terminal cylinders are connected by a curved tube of small diameter , within which the glowing discharge takes place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en-closing bulb filled with neon gas at a pressure of 20 millimeters . This lamp however , is still in the experimental stage . Another type 4 of gaseous conductor or corona lamp , which may be operated on a 115-volt system , has in one of its forms two par allel magnesium wire electrodes about one-tenth inch ( 0.25 centi meter ) in diameter and one-fourth to one inch ( 0.6 to 2.5 centi meters ) long . These electrodes are spaced about one thirty-second inch ( one millimeter ) apart , and have a resistance of several // thousand ohms mounted in the base and connected in series with the filament . The bulb is filled with low-pressure gas , consisting mainly of neon and helium , though the latter is in the nature of a rather harmless impurity . When an alternating voltage is applied to such a lamp a very small current flows , even as low as 0.001 ampere in one case , and a " close fitting envelope of yellow-reddish light " surrounds each electrode . This is the " negative-glow " and alternates so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous at both . With direct current , only the negative electrode is luminous . These lamps consume from about one and one-half watts to as low as one-tenth watt . Thus , especially in the smaller sizes , the cost of operation is negligible . Such lamps therefore make good indicators for the location of room switches , and to show whether circuits to flatirons and other heating devices are closed . The larger lamps are useful for indoor signs , for illumination of house numbers , for night lights and for other uses calling for small lightsources . The use of these lamps as flashing road signals is considered in ? 153 . The fact that the light of the gaseous filament lamp varies instantaneously with change in current makes this type of lamp ideal for use in television , that is in seeing moving objects by wire . The fact that there is no time-lag so that the light coincides exactly with the current-flow makes this type of lamp essential to the transmission of moving pictures . Much larger lamps are being made for this purpose with light-producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 cm . ) . CHAPTER IV LIGHT MODIFICATION 36 . General . With the light-sources of earlier generations it was customary to utilize the light just as it came from the candle or oil lamp . The great brightness of modern electric lamps , however , as well as a more general appreciation of the characteristics of good illumination , has led to the extended use of reflectors , globes , and other devices designed to modify the effect produced by the light . Indeed it is a good general rule that a modern lightsource should never be used for illumination without some lightmodifying accessory . These devices depend for their action on the three phenomena , reflection , absorption , and transmission , as briefly described in ? ? 9 and 10 . Upon these phenomena also depend all distinctions in appearance between surfaces as to shade , color , and texture . A more detailed study of these effects is therefore in order at this point . 37 . Reflection of Light . As indicated in ? 10 , of the two types of reflection , diffuse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proportion of the light falling upon any diffusing surface which it reflects , determines the shade of the surface , that is , whether dark or light . The phenomenon of diffuse reflection may be explained by considering the mat surface as made up of a great number of very small specularly reflecting particles directing their reflected beams in all directions . If a completely diffusing surface were illuminated , it would appear uniformly bright from all directions . The candle power in any direction would therefore be proportional to the apparent area of the surface as viewed from that direction ; that is , it would be proportional to the cosine of the angle which the line of sight makes with the normal to the surface . Practically , however , most apparently depolished or mat surfaces are really far from being completely diffusing . It is usual therefore to find that a surface appears brighter 66 // along the line of specularly reflected rays than toward other directions . For this reason ordinary black paint or black cloth is often unsatisfactory where it is desired to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photographic cameras and other optical apparatus . Black velvet , because of the projecting fibers , gives the lowest reflection at large angles of incidence . Its reflection factor may be as low as one half of one per cent . The same principle is applied by the use of diaphragms to optical instruments : by these diaphragms the light rays are entirely cut off from the visible reflecting surfaces . The converse of the above principle states that in the case of a completely diffusing surface , its brightness is proportional to its illumination , regardless of the angle from which the light comes . This is important in the case of the measurement of illumination where some or all of the light-sources produce rays which make large angles with the normal to the lighted surface , that is to the normal to the transmitting or reflecting test-plate of the illummom-eterl or photometer . While blotting paper and specially depolished glass are fairly accurate in this respect , they are far from perfect , so that where the illumination comes largely from light which makes a small angle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to use test-plates which are compensated by allowing some of the light to come also to the underside of the test plate . This lack of complete diffusion leads to the recognition of two ad-ditional types : mixed reflection and spread reflection . The former is the effect obtained from most polished or glossy surfaces such as // polished wood , china , enamel , or glazed paper , where part of the light is reflected diffusely , while part is reflected specularly , and so shows an image of the source of light . This is illustrated in Fig. 28 . In spread reflection there is a decided directional tendency , close to the angle of the specularly directed beam ; that is , the surface appears much brighter when looked at from that direction , but no image of the light-source is discerned . This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 29 . Examples are depolished metals , aluminum paint , and a water surface slightly roughened by the wind . The reflection factor , as explained in ? 10 , is the ratio of the light reflected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various materials and surfaces are given in Tables I , II , and III of Chapter I. In selective reflection , discussed at length in Chapter XV , surfaces reflect more of one wave-length than another ; upon this phenomenon depends the color of an object . 38 . Transmission of Light . This has been defined in ? 9 . Among all transparent and translucent materials , glass is of the greatest importance in lighting , because of its use for lamp bulbs , windows , etc. ; the translucent forms , that is the diffusing and re fracting glasses , present the most interesting problems . The use-fulness of such glass comes , as indicated above , from its ability to diffuse the light falling upon it , thus decreasing its brightness and giving the other advantages described in ? ? 58 and 59 . When the light is transmitted without appreciable diffusion , the exact image of the light-source is visible and the surface of the transmitting material does not itself appear bright . When diffusion exists , the // whole surface becomes a secondary source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear a bright spot on the glass in the direction of the light-source , with the brightness decreasing as the distance of the point observed from this bright spot increases . The better the diffusion the more uniformly bright will the surface appear . This effect may be seen to a greater or less extent in the case of most of the globes used as light-sources . Generally a high degree of diffusion is not compatible with high transmission , but with a given transmission great differences in diffusion are found in different kinds of glass . Diffusion in transmission is generally obtained by one or more of five methods : first , by using a material such as paper , fabric , or opal glass , which is homogeneously translucent ; second , by sus-pending in a clear glass , small opaque white particles , from one to another of which the light is reflected as it passes through ; this is known as suspension or alabaster glass . Diffusion of sunlight by clouds takes place on the same principle . The third method depends upon a roughening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of which are popularly known as " frosting . " The fourth is by the use of larger irregular reflecting surfaces in the forms known as " stippled , " " pebbled , " " Florentine , " or other similar designs . ' The fifth method depends on carefully designed prisms , the angles of which are such as will break up the rays and distribute them in all directions . Such glass is known as prismatic glass . Two of these methods are sometimes combined ; for instance a fine velvet frosting may be used with the prismatic glass , or a light opalescence with stippled glass . Under illumination the ap pearance of diffusing glass made by either of the first two methods is quite different from that made by the third . Generally the opal , or suspension glass , is of fairly uniform brightness over its whole surface , even if quite thin ; and if it is thin enough , the filament of the inclosed lamp will show through as a more or less faint , reddish line . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the light-source and shades off rapidly toward the edge . This appears as a diffused spot even if the glass is only lightly etched and the form of the filament can not be distinguished . // The roughened glass , when exposed , has the serious defect of col lecting more dust and being harder to clean than the smooth opal escent glass , or than the coarser irregular surfaces of the last two types . 39 . Refraction.I The prismatic glass is particularly interesting because of the care that has been taken in its design as well as for the results obtained . It depends upon a particular phase of transmission , known as refraction . This principle is applied not only for diffusion but also for re-direction of light from globes . When a ray of light passes at an angle through a surface which separates two transparent media of different densities , as for instance , air and water , or air and glass , it is bent out of its path , and follows a new one , making an angle with the former , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inclination at which the ray strikes the glass . This phenomenon is called refraction . It is due to the different rates at which light travels in media of different densities . It is illustrated in Fig. 30 . Since air and glass have quite different densities , refraction between them is quite marked , and this is made use of in many applications such as the lens of the telescope and microscope and the prism of the spectroscope . If the two surfaces of this glass are parallel , the ray is bent back to its former direction on leaving the glass . If , however , the surfaces make an angle with each other , the ray can be bent permanently as in Fig. 30 . If the prisms are rather low , rounding , and of varying curvature , or in other words if the glass is fluted , light passing through at different points will be refracted in differLIGHT // ent directions , and diffusion will result . See Fig. 31 . These bent rays will come to the eye from a wide angle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , by making the prisms horizontal and giving each the proper cross section , the rays from different parts of the glass can be bent so as to leave the surface in one definite direction as desired and approximately parallel . This makes possible a high degree of control in the distribution of the light . See ? ? 58 and 59. 40 . Total Reflection by Prisms . In the last section two applications of prisms , diffusion by means of low rounding prisms , or cylindrical surfaces , and re-direction by prisms of carefully designed form , were suggested . Another optical phenomenon , known as total reflection of light by prisms , is also applied in the case of reflectors . It can be shown by the formula for the angle of bending derived in ? 147 that there is a definite angle at and beyond which light reaching a surface of a less dense medium can not pass through the surface but must be reflected back into the denser medium from which it comes . By covering the outside surface of a clear glass reflector with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the light , being about as effective as though the reflector were silvered . If the vertices of the prisms are slightly rounded and fillets are placed in the depressions between them , a small amount of light will be transmitted directly through , lighting up the outside of the reflector and the ceiling above it . These effects are shown in Fig. 32. 41 . Absorption . All the radiation which falls upon a surface and which is neither reflected nor transmitted , is absorbed . This means that it is changed into heat , thus raising the temperature of the absorbing body . A familiar example of this is the difference in the heat-absorbing quality of black and of white clothing . Most // so-called opaque bodies of any considerable thickness absorb all of the light that is not reflected , since in such materials light will be transmitted only to a slight depth before being absorbed . In-deed , the percentage of light absorbed is proportional to thickness in all bodies . As has been already mentioned , there is no appreci able light at a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of illumination , absorption plays two important roles . In the first place it determines the darkness , that is , the proportion of black and white of a surface ; and in the case of colored bodies , selective absorption , the converse of selec tive reflection , determines the color . See Chapter XV . In the second place , it determines the efficiency of globes and of reflectors and reflecting surfaces , such as ceilings . It also determines the effectiveness of lamp shades and screens . In the case of opaque reflectors , absorption has a reciprocal relation to reflection ; it is determined by the character of the surface and by the material only in so far as this establishes the color or the degree of polish obtainable . In the case of translucent materials , the absorption has a wide range , even for light colors . Glass such as is used for reflectors and globes can be made so that the absorption is very small , often below ten per cent ; even as low as two per cent has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , calls for research and skill , and it is not at all representative of most of the glassware on the market . Low absorption can be obtained either with opal glass , that is , glass of a homogeneous white material , or with suspension glass , in which small , white , reflecting particles are suspended in a clear medium . Also either of these materials can be adapted to give any ratio of transmission to reflection . Thus one may have such a ratio as low as one to ten or as high as two and one-half to one . Higher ratios than the latter could be made readily , but they would not be satisfactory in globes or bowls from the point of view of diffusion . Absorption due to dust and dirt on glass and on reflecting sur faces is the principal factor in light depreciation and determines the frequency of cleaning needed . See ? 71 . Absorption , due to // filament material deposited on the bulb , has much to do with the decrease in the lumens and in the efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light . The preceding sections have presented several cases where light rays are deflected from their normal straight-line courses by the effects of reflection , refraction , or diffusion . It is evident that the distribution of the luminous flux which is produced by a given light-source , equipped with a device producing one or more of these three effects will be determined by the surface and the shape of reflecting devices and by the transmission and shape of refracting and diffusing devices . By the proper selection of these factors , a wide variation in the character of the distribution is obtainable . One extreme of this variation is the case where as much of the flux as practicable is directed into a single narrow cone or beam . This is light-projection and by means of it , candle powers hundreds and even thousands of times that of the original source may be obtained , though only within a very small angle . The theory , characteristics and applications of light-projection are considered in detail in Chapter XIV . For the present it will suffice to call attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 a satisfactory proportion of the luminous flux from a light-source may be obtained in a conical beam , and by proper design and adjustment the spread or angle of such a beam may be varied from a fraction of a degree upward . To get good results in light-projection the luminous area of the light-source should be concentrated to a small diameter . Such concentration is inherently characteristic of the electric arc , which therefore lends itself particularly well to projection work . It is also possible to keep down the effective diameter of the luminous area in incandescent lamps by special arrangement of the filament . In comparing the use of reflectors and lenses , it may be noted that while the former are much more efficient and generally less expensive , there is necessarily a considerable amount of stray or " spilled " light , coming directly from the lamp , which in some cases is objectionable and may be eliminated when a lens is used . // 43 . Distribution Curves . Every light-source gives a characteristic distribution of its flux which depends upon the shape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any form of light-modifying device is used , this distribution is changed , often very considerably . The practicability thus to adapt a light-source to particular applications is an important element in modern lighting . To represent and specify the light distribution of a light-source or luminaire , a distribution curve is used . This is a polar curve which is determined by laying off along each radius the candle power as given at the appropriate angle . As the horizontal distribution of most light-sources and luminaires is approximately uniform , often only one half of the curve is given . Figures 42 and 43 show characteristic examples . Such curves are used for several purposes . An inspection of the curve indicates the general character of the unit and facilitates a decision as to the suitableness of the light-source or luminaire for any particular application . In making calculations of the illumination at particular points , the candle power is obtained from the distribution curve for the appropriate angle . Again the total number of lumens , and hence the mean spherical candle power , can be calculated from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted however that the area of such a curve is not proportional to the lumens produced . CHAPTER V THE MEASUREMENT OF LIGHT AND ILLUMINATION Introduction . Real knowledge of a physical phenomenon does not progress far until measurement of it has been undertaken . Photometry , or the measurement of light , is a large subject , and its discussion fills many books . Here it will be considered briefly and only in so far as it has immediate application in connection with the study and practice of illumination . The measurement of can dle power has occupied the attention of physicists for more than 160 years , but it is a much shorter time since the Weber portable photometer , the first important instrument , primarily for the measurement of illumination , was developed . The Principle of the Photometer . ' For commercial photom etry , the photo-electric cell is rapidly replacing the human eye ; however , the use of the photometer , which compares vis ually the illumination from the unknown source , or the illumina tion which itself is to be measured , with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all light-measurements must be referred . To make this comparison , either the unknown , or the standard illumination , or both , - must be varied in a determinable way . This adjustment can be made by one or more of several methods . Some of these are continuous , others stepwise . By far the most important of the continuous methods is the variation of the distance of one or both of the lamps from the comparison screen , that is , the screen upon which the comparison is made . Another continuous method which is used in the Marten photom eter involves the polarization of the light from the two sources and then its interception by crossed Nicol prisms 2 which can be // rotated so as to produce a balance between the illumination from the two sources . Among the stepwise methods are two which are in general use . These are the sectored disk 1 and the absorption screen of known constant . The former is used on bench or stationary photometers only . It depends upon the fact that when a disk from which several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path of one of the beams , the luminous flux passed through it is reduced in proportion to the ratio of the degrees of the disk cut out to 360 degrees . Thus if there are four sectors each of 22z ? or a total of 90 ? cut out , the resulting illumination will be 90/360 or one-fourth of that produced by the unmodified beam . By combining two sectored disks , superimposed one upon the other , different ratios can be obtained readily , and thus lights of various and much higher candle powers can be conveniently compared with the standard lamp . The rotation must be so fast that the eye will perceive no flicker . This will vary with the illumination : for one foot-candle ( 10 lux ) 40 flashes per second is sufficient . Speeds above the critical value make no difference in the results . Calibrated absorp tion screens are much used in portable photometers . For instance , with a screen passing one-tenth of the light and which can be placed in one or the other beam at will , the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times the range of the scale readings . Such screens are available to 1/100 or even higher ratios . Most photometers , then , combine the continuous-adjustment method by changing the relative distance to the lights with either the absorbing screen or the sectored disk . Colored filters of glass or gelatin also are used to make the color quality of the screen illumination from different illuminants correspond more closely . ' ' The determination of the absorption constants of these color-filters must go back to comparison by the eye , but much more care can be taken in calibrating one screen than in making each of the many comparisons which the screen would facilitate . Such cali brated filters can be obtained through the Bureau of Standards and other testing laboratories . // When a balance has been established between the illumination from the unknown lamp and that from the standard lamp , the inverse-square law gives the relation where X is the unknown candles , I the standard candles , and dx and d2 the corresponding distances between the photometer screen and the two lamps . If the photometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the candles can be read off directly . The exactness of visual photometric measurements is limited by the sensitiveness of the eye to differences in brightness ; which is somewhat less than one per cent for fields of moderate brightness . This sensitiveness is considerably less , however , if the degrees of brightness compared are very low . The accuracy of the measurement may be affected unfavorably by assuming the inverse square and cosine laws . The errors due to these assumptions , however , are small if the distance from the light to the photometer screen is not less than 10 times the major diameter of the light-source and if the rays fall approximately normally upon the screen . If , however , the light-source has large dimensions , as in the case of a translucent globe or a mercury-arc tube , or if part or all of the light comes to the screen at a large angle of incidence , as in measuring the illumination on a street , surface , the errors due to the assumption of these laws must be given careful consideration . Personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable errors in the observations , especially where there is a difference in the color of the light-sources compared . As indicated in ? 52 , the calibration of the standard lamp and its maintenance requires particular care . The great variation of candle power even with small changes in voltage ' indicates also the importance of accurate standardization of the electrical instruments employed . Taking all sources of error into account , it is practicable to maintain an accuracy of within one or two per cent for lights of approximately similar color.2 // In contrast with these difficulties experienced in the practice of visual photometry , the recently developed methods which use the photo-electric cell make the determination of lumens or candles entirely dependent upon the measuring of a current or upon reduc ing a current to a minimum value . These methods already have been adopted to a considerable extent in commercial photom etry . The photo-electric cell ' consists of a spherical bulb similar to an incandescent lamp . The interior surface of this bulb is first silvered and then coated with an " alkali metal " such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter metal . An opening or " window " is left in one side to admit the light which is being measured . This surface is connected electrically to one terminal of the cell while the other terminal is connected to a metallic plate inside the bulb . The cell is filled with an inert gas , such as argon , at a low pressure . A rather high potential of , say , 100 volts is ap plied across the terminals of this cell . When light enters the " window , " ionization of the gas takes place and a minute current passes between the terminals . This current is too low for conven ient measurement , but may be increased by a suitable amplifica tion system to a useful value . Several methods for the application of the photo-electric cell to photometry have been suggested and are in use for commercial measurement . In one method , " the first to be put into practical use , a device is employed which illuminates the cell alternately with the rays from the two light-sources . A pulsating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal . This is applied to the primary winding of an electric transformer and the resulting variation in the intensity of the magnetic flux pro duces an alternating current in the secondary winding . This alternating current can be detected easily and the point when the // adjustable illumination becomes equal to the standard can be determined by the decrease of this current to a minimum . Other systems also have been devised in which one or two cells are used with suitable electric circuits to take the place of the human eye in obtaining a balance between the light under test and a standard lamp of known candle power . ' Ideal conditions for photo-electric photometry , however , call for a cell which passes a current directly proportional to the illumina tion falling upon its light-sensitive surface . With such a device all that is required for the measurement of candle power is such a cell combined with proper electric circuits , including amplification if needed , and a current-measuring instrument of suitable range . Such a system may be calibrated to read directly the candle power of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The improvements already made in the photo-electric cell are such that , with a light amber filter , a degree of accuracy satisfac tory for commercial photometry is easily obtainable by these direct-reading methods . The filter is necessary because the photo-electric cell does not show the same sensitiveness to radiation of different colors as does the human eye , that is , it does not have the same " sensibility curve , " 3 though in its most suitable forms it ap proaches this curve quite closely , being somewhat more sensitive to the shorter wave-lengths or blue radiation . In addition to giving greater speed , the direct-reading method eliminates the photometer head , carriage , and bar used in devices for comparison with a standard lamp . The maintenance of a work ing standard lamp is also made unnecessary . On the other hand , greater care in keeping the working voltage constant is required . All photo-electric methods make unnecessary the darkened work ing room and greatly decrease the strain upon the operator . The skill required of the operator is not so great . For commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being measured , the advantage of such photo-electric methods are quite obvious . // 46 . Bench Photometers . The simplest photometer , and one that anyone can construct easily for himself , is the Rumford shadow photometer . A rod is placed between the two light-sources and a white screen , and the lights are so located that the shadows of the rod cast on the screen by them are adjacent to each other and are equally illuminated . The distances to the screen are then the d , and di of the formula . Such a device , however , is good only for rough comparisons . A somewhat more accurate device , though a very simple one , is the Bunsen photometer . This is shown in Fig. 33 . In this , as in all the later bench photometers , the two light-sources are placed at the ends of a track , upon which runs the comparison device or " photometer head " mounted upon wheels . In this case a paper disk , the center of which has been rendered translucent by means of paraffin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cov ered frame and at right angles to the light rays . This housing has openings at each end to admit the light and in the front side for observation . Through this opening the two sides of the disk can be seen simultaneously in two mirrors , also mounted in the housing and set at suitable angles . Much of the light which falls upon the central treated portion is transmitted , and when the appearances of the two sides in the mirrors are identical , the candle powers of the two light-sources are equal . The box can be turned over , end for end , so that any inequalities in the reflection factors of the two mirrors or of the two sides of the paper are compensated for by taking two readings , one on each side , and using their mean value . // If the absorptions of the transmitted and of the reflected light are the same , the inner and outer portions of the disk will appear of equal brightness when equally illuminated . Such an arrangement is known as an " equality of brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lummer-Brodhun , one form of which is illustrated in Fig. 34 . The object of this device is to show images of the two sides of a photometer screen simultane-ously and in close juxtaposition . These appear either as a disk surrounded by a ring , an equality of brightness type , or as two adjacent half-disks , Fig. 35 , in which each half-disk shows a small area within itself , RI or LI , which L is illumi-Hated by the other lamp . This latter arrangement is known as the contrast type , and especially for slight difference in color is more accurate than the equality of brightness type . The spots , Li and RI , in the centers of the half-disks , are given a little less light than the screens , SI and S2 . In this case instead of equal brightness , equal contrast between the adjacent surfaces is obtained in order to establish a balance between the light-sources . Not only is this type more accurate when the color of the lights is not exactly the same , but its use is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated fields are obtained by the optical system of reflecting and transmitting surfaces shown in Fig. 35 , for the contrast type . // The prism R has total reflecting surfaces at RI and R2 but at LI and L2 it is in optical contact with prism L , and the light is not reflected but passes on through . On the other side , the light from source L passes directly through at LI and L2 to the observing telescope , while at RI and R2 it is reflected back . Thus the portions of the field RI and R2 are illuminated from the source R , which is here supposed to be the weaker , while the portions LI and L2 are illuminated from the source L , which is taken as the stronger . The box is reversed , end for end , to compensate for inequalities , in the same way as with the Bunsen photometer. 47 . Photometry of Colored Lights . The accuracy of photo-metric measurement depends upon the closeness with which the equality of brightness or identity of contrast of the two parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for skill and practice even for lights of the same color , where the parts of the field appear identical when the brightness is equal . When , however , the two sides are of different colors , the deter mination depends upon the judgment of the observer as to the brightness of two adjacent fields of different color . This is much more difficult , and the judgment of different observers , or even of the same observer at different times , is likely to differ consider-ably . This is especially true when the color difference is great , as in the case of comparing light from the mercury are with that from // the incandescent lamp . Such measurements are called " hetero chromatic " photometry . The use of colored absorbing screens or color filters to assist in such measurements has been mentioned in ? 45 . Another method involves the principle that if a photom eter field is alternately illuminated in rapid succession , with lights of different color , there will appear through the observing telescope a flicker if the two lights are of different intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , the flicker will become less and finally disap pear altogether unless the lights are of widely dif ferent color . The point where the flicker disappears or reaches a min imum is taken as that of equal illumination . A photometer designed to make use of this principle is known as a flicker photom eter . Various devices have been developed for this purpose , and descriptions will be found in works on photometry . A recent and much used type of flicker photometer I is named after its in ventor , E. F. Kingsbury . It is illustrated in Fig. 36 . In the telescope-tube of this photometer is a rotating prism , driven by a little motor , as shown in the figure . By the refraction of this prism the line of sight , when looking through the telescope , is bent slightly away from the axis . Then if the prism is revolved , Journal of the Franklin Institute , August , 1915 , p. 215. // this bent portion of the line of sight swings around the axis of the tube and there appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band or broad ring . This ring will be concentric with the field illuminated by the two lamps which are being compared . If alternate quadrants of the field are illuminated separately , by two unequal light-sources under comparison , alternating fields differing in intensity , or color , or both , are seen in the telescope , and if the rotation is fairly rapid , a flickering effect is produced . The illumination of alternate quadrants by the two lamps is ob tained by a system of prisms similar to those of the regular Lum mer-Brodhun sight-box . If the speed is increased the flicker due to difference in color will first disappear , and then at a considerably higher speed the flicker due to difference in intensity will go . In the use of the instrument , the greatest sensitiveness is obtained by revolving the prism just fast enough to eliminate the color flicker . Then the relative illumination from the lamps being com pared is varied till the flicker due to intensity is eliminated . It is assumed that with the flicker reduced to zero or a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the relation of their candle powers is calculated from the dis tances to the lamps by means of the inverse-square law . Near the eyepiece in Fig. 36 is seen the housing of a miniature lamp which illuminates the white-painted interior of the eyepiece tube . The flickering field thus appears as a small disk in the middle of a large area illuminated to nearly the same degree of bright ness . Especially when lights of great color-difference are compared , the intensity-ratio which gives minimum flicker will depend upon the level of the illumination and upon the frequency of the light alternations . ' This is an inherent disadvantage of the flicker pho tometer , but changing the conditions under which the measurement is made will also alter the results obtained by the direct-comparison method , and the successive readings under the same conditions are much less concordant than those obtainable with the flicker photometer.2 Furthermore , it is not certain that results obtained // by the latter method are essentially more correct than those ob tained by the flicker method . For cases where the difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two methods is not serious . For large color differences , it would appear that agreement between different groups of observers could be obtained only through standardizing the conditions under which measurements are to be made . With the flicker photometer as with the direct-comparison method , determinations by different individuals differ considerably and representative data can be secured only by averaging the results obtained by several ob servers.1 48 . Portable Photometers . While the bench photometer is essential in work with light-sources and is necessary for standard ization purposes , the portable photometer is a tool much more ex tensively employed by the student of illumination . As explained in discussing the bench photometer , the candle power of an un known light-source is determined by comparing the illumination produced by it with that from a standard lamp . A portable pho tometer is set up so that the illumination which it is desired to measure , can be compared with that produced by the standard ized lamp in the photometer . Such a comparison can be made in either of two ways . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of the light entering the photometer-head from outside . The instrument is set so that this white glass receives , in the proper plane , the illumina tion to be measured . In the other method , a diffusing disk of white and highly reflecting material , usually white glass or blotting paper , is placed at the surface where the illumination is to be measured , and the light reflected from it is permitted to enter the photometer tube and come to the Lummer-Brodhun prisms . Each method has its advantages , though the reflecting disk is often more convenient . // Most portable photometers are built along much the same lines , differing only in arrangement and detail . Each has a LummerBrodhun head mounted at one end of a short tube or box . Provision is made to move back and forth in this tube a small standard lamp , with a pointer , which shows its position on a scale graduated in foot-candles ( or lux ) . Light from this lamp reaches one side of the prisms in the head , while that from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the methods described above . An electric meter measures the current or voltage of the lamp , and a resistance is provided to adjust it . When the current // has been adjusted to the proper value , as determined by the calibration described below , and a light balance has been obtained , the pointer on the scale gives the value of the illumination being measured . Two portable photometers of this type , now in general use in the United States , are described below . The Sharp-Millar portable photometer has been longest available . ' It is inclosed in a rectangular wooden box , as seen in Fig. 37 . The lamp is carried in a little car ; this is pulled back and forth between guides by a cord which runs over the axis of a regulating knob . An ingenious system of screens moves back and forth with the car and cuts out reflection from the sides of the box . These features of the photometer are shown in Fig. 38 . The absorbing screens are inserted or removed by turning a knob within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used with a white-glass cap or a separate reflecting disk . It is made in two sizes ; the larger , 28 inches ( 71 centimeters ) long , the largest and probably the most accurate of the portable photometers here described . The Macbeth photometer , shown in Fig. 39 , has a round tube about ten inches ( 25 centimeters ) long , at the end of which the // Lummer-Brodhun head is attached . The lamp is carried on a rod that slides in and out of the tube and is graduated in foot-candles . A special control-box contains dry cells for the lamp , a milliammeter , two rheostats , and a two-way switch . The latter , together with one of the rheostats , is for use in calibrating the working standard by means of a specially mounted standard lamp that accompanies the instrument . The photometer tube is held in the hands and is generally used with a white-glass reflecting disk , though it can also be used with a small , white-glass cap . Small ab sorbing screens can be inserted through slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portable photometer for the measurement of illumination is made easily by comparison with the illumination produced on its test-screen when the latter is placed at a known distance from a standard lamp . This standardized illumination , of course , is calculated by dividing the candles of the lamp by the square of the distance . Thus , if the candles be 32 and the distance // be four feet , the illumination will be two foot-candles . The index is then set at the proper point on the scale , in this case " 2 " , and the current through the working standard lamp of the photometer is adjusted up and down until a brightness balance is obtained in the photometer . The average of several such readings should be taken . When the current through the working standard lamp has been adjusted to the value found in the calibration , and a balance is obtained on the photometer screen for an unknown illumination , the value of the latter will be indicated by the position of the index on the foot-candle scale , as long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisable for best results . The foot-candle meter operates quite differently from other in struments for the measurement of illumination . This meter is illus trated in Fig. 40 . It is inexpensive and so simple to use , that it requires but little experience or technical knowledge to get satis factory results with it . Already it has done much toward popular izing quantitative ideas with regard to illumination . It is well adapted to use by factory or store managers , inspectors , and others responsible for the maintenance or use of lighting installations . A small standard lamp is mounted in the end of a rectangular tube 74 inches ( 19 centimeters ) long and is regulated and adjusted by a rheostat and meter ; it is operated with a three-cell flash-light battery , located , with the light-box in a bakelite case with dimen00 MODERN LIGHTING sions about 4 X 8X 1 z inches ( 10 X 20 X 4 centimeters ) . The bottom of the light-box has a slightly inclined mirror . The top has the illumination-comparison device . A row of small holes extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a piece of cardboard , which has also a foot-candle scale running parallel with the row of holes . These holes in the cardboard are covered with translucent paper through which the light from the standard lamp shines ; it is bright at the end next the lamp and with decreasing brightness toward the other end . When the voltage has been adjusted to bring the needle of the meter to the calibrated mark and the case is set so that the scale on the punched cardboard is lighted nor mally with the illumination which is to be measured , the holes at the end next to the lamp will appear brighter , and at the other end , darker , than the illuminated surface . At one point the brightness of the holes will be the same as that of the adjacent reflecting surface . The scale reading at this point will be the desired illumination in // foot-candles . The range of the scale is one to fifty foot-candles ( 10 to 500 lux ) . By adjusting the voltage to other points on the scale the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/100 . With this instrument the accuracy of the results will usually lie between 10 per cent and 15 per cent plus or minus . While this is a large error , there are many cases where such an accuracy is sufficient . 49 . Distribution Curves . As applied to light-sources , all of the instruments so far discussed measure candle power in one direction ; one such mea urement therefore does not give a complete specifica tion . If , however , the lamp is continuously rotated about its axis at a low speed , just sufficient to eliminate flicker , an aver-age reading for the angle at which the axis is inclined will be obtained . This speed ranges from 80 rev-olutions per minute for small lamps to 20 for large ones . Thus , if the axis is at right angles to the bar , an average horizontal value will be read . If the axis is tilted to 45 degrees with the tip of the lamp toward the photometer-head an average value for the 45-degree angle will be obtained . A rotator for this purpose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of angles , for instance , every 15 degrees , the data for a distribution curve will become available . Such curves are shown in Fig. 42 . ( A ) represents that for an unmodified Mazda C lamp and ( B ) for the same lamp equipped with a focusing prismatic I reflector ; Fig. 43 shows a curve for an open carbon are . // The lumens and the mean spherical candle power can be calculated from the distribution curve by one of the methods given in the next article . 50 . Calculation of Total Lumens and hence of Mean Spherical Candle Power . ' The mean spherical candle power is not , as might at first sight appear , proportional to the area inclosed by the distribution curve , but must be obtained from the curve by a somewhat complicated procedure . In Fig. 44 let R be a radius of a sphere surrounding the light-source at 0 ; let this radius make an angle a with the horizontal ; let the elementary solid angle , da . be represented by POQ . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc , PQ , around the vertical diameter , MS ; hence PQ = Rda ; also the area of the zone = PQ X 2 7rr = Rda X 2 7rR cos a , since r = R cos a . This quantity , 27rR2 cos a da , divided by R2 , is equal to 27r cos ada , and is the elementary solid angle . The product of this and I , the average candle power for this angle as ob-tained from the distribution curve , gives for the solid angle , da , between a2 and a , , dF = 2714 cos a ( la and hence the total flux is // This expression can not in general be integrated but if the whole angle from a = ? 7r/2 to a = + it/2 be divided into n equal angles , then , as an approximation , the flux for each zone is But t a =7r/n ; hence The total flux , F , may then be expressed approximately as Thus if 12 zones of 15 ? each be taken , this summation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle power values of the corresponding zones must be multiplied to calculate the lumens of the respective zones . These zonal fluxes are then added to obtain the total lumens of the light-source . These constants for 15 ? zones are given in Table X. // It will be noted that the factor is least at 72 and at 1722 de grees and greatest at 822 and 972 degrees from the perpendicular . An examination of Fig. 44 will show that the solid angle and zonal surface generated by revolving S 0 T is much less than that gener ated by S'O T ' . Indeed , the ratio of their solid angles is 1.64/0.214 , or 7.6 to 1 . This is the ratio of the weighting constants by which the average candle powers are multipled . Again , a high average candle power for the 822 degree zone means a much larger contribution to the total flux than does the same candle power at 7 degrees . This explains why in Fig. 42 the curve B for the downward concentrated light , in spite of its large area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmodi fied flux of the bare lamp . In this case the small area for the bare lamp indicates about 2570 lumens , while the large area for the reflector unit gives about 2250 lumens . Another method for calculating the lumens is that of using equal solid angles or zonal areas instead of equal revolved angles . The vertical altitudes of such a series of zones are all equal . In this case the total lumens will be 47rla , where la is the average of the illumination values for the zones used . One set of angles for such equal-area zones are , in degrees from the perpendicular , 24 , 41 , 54 , 65 , 75 , 85 , 95 , - 105 , 115 , 126 , 139 , 156 . These are angles corresponding to mid-altitudes of 12 equal-area zones . Evidently the mean spherical candle power will be obtained from the lumens by using 12.6 as a divisor. 51 . The Spherical Photometer . ' The method of obtaining the lumens of a light-source by determining the candle-power distribu tion curve and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for making this determination . It is , however , quite tedious and fortunately needs only to be used originally in stand ardizing lumen-standard lamps . Then to obtain the lumens of an unknown light-source , it is compared with a lumen-standard by means of the spherical photometer or integrating sphere . This is also called after its inventor , the Ulbrich sphere . One of these is shown closed in Fig. 45 , and opened to change the lamp in Fig. 46. // A sphere of large diameter , as compared to the diameter of the light-source , is painted on the inside surface with a nonselective white paint of high and permanent reflection factor and high diffusion . A hole in the side of the sphere is covered with white glass , which may be the cap of a portable photometer . Within the sphere is suspended , somewhat above the center , a socket used first for the lumen-standard and then for the unknown light-source . A small white screen cuts off the direct rays of the light-source from the white glass test-plate . With this arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proportional to the total lumens of the light-source . In Fig. 47 let the circle be a great circle of the sphere . Consider the illumination at B received by reflection from an element of the area dA located at A. Let I denote the candle power of dA regarded as a light-source , and b the illumination at B received from dA . Then because a = 0 and 1= 2 r cos a . Since this equation will hold true for any two points on the sphere , it follows that the illumination at every point produced by reflection from every other point is constant and the same . The illumination at every point due to light once reflected is thus proportional to the total flux of the light-source . The same reasoning applies to second and successive reflections . Thus the total illumination at any point due to reflection is proportional to the flux and may be used as a measure of it . This does not apply to light received directly from the light-source , which varies for different points and must therefore be screened off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The applicability of the theory of the Ulbrich sphere to the actual apparatus is somewhat affected by the absorption of light by the screens and by the nonluminous parts of the lumina.ire ; also by the lack of perfect diffusion of the painted interior surface . However by using the substitution method and by taking other needed precautions the errors can be reduced to negligible values . ' // The calibration of the sphere is accomplished by the substitution method . A lumen-standard is placed in the sphere , Fig. 47 , in place of the " tested lamp , " and the current on the photometer lamp adjusted so that a balance is obtained at a Ionvenient multiple of the lumens given by the standard . With this current maintained the photometer then will balance at the correct lumens of any unknown source that is substituted for the lumen-standard . It is usual to have a second lamp in the sphere also screened off from the test-plate , to which lamp the current can be temporarily switched , measured , and ad-justed . This lamp is then used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Six feet ( 2 meters ) is a usual diameter for general use , but for small incandescent lamps a 30-inch ( 75-centimeter ) sphere is sufficiently large . Provision must be made for the conven-ient introduction of the lamps to be measured and also for entrance in-to the sphere for paint-ing and other work . An important apple-cation of the sphere is its use as an absolute reflectometer . For this purpose a sphere about five inches in diameter , painted white inside , and arranged for use with a portable photometer , is employed . ' This combinaMEASUREMENT // Lion makes practicable the easy and accurate determination of the reflection factor I of any given surface , no matter of what character or how located . One of these sphere reflectometers attached to a Macbeth photometer is shown in Fig. 48 . In Fig. 49 is a side view of the instrument parallel to the plane of the tube which carries the small lamp used to illuminate the surface under test . This tube is mounted at an angle so that by turning it around on the radial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the test-piece or upon , the inner wall of the sphere at the right and about 90 ? away from the test-piece . It will be observed that the test-piece is located against a hole at the bottom of the sphere and that it forms practically a part of the wall itself . The photometer is directed to measure the brightness of a spot on the inside wall . This observed spot is screened from the test-piece but is not screened from the spot , which is directly illuminated by the light when the light tube is turned toward the sphere wall . The observed spot is at 90 ? from each of the above light-reflecting spots . Two readings are taken , one with the reflectometer light directed upon the test surface , the other , with it turned toward the spot on the sphere wall . The // ratio of these two readings is the reflection factor of the test sur-face . This is shown as follows : Let m = the reflection factor of the inside surface of the sphere and F , the luminous flux received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor of the surface under test . In the first reading , since the observed spot is screened from the test-piece , light reaches the former only after being reflected once from the test-piece and one or more times from the inside of the sphere . Thus the illumination will be proportional to that is to On the other hand , the light from the illuminated wall spot in the second reading is not screened off from the observed spot ; thus the illumination from the source is proportional to The quotient of these is evidently x , the desired reflection factor of the test-piece . It is evident that this result will not be affected by the character of the reflector , whether specular , or diffuse , or of an intermediate character , since in any case the total reflected flux is measured . The reflection factor obtained in this way is of course that for the color of the light supplied by the instrument lamp , ordinarily that of a gas-filled incandescent . By using an auxiliary concentrated beam of light , this same instrument can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the same general principles as the Ulbrich sphere has been developed by Frank A. Benford.2 This consists of an hemisphere with white interior . The photometer tube is attached at a hole in the center of the hemisphere and a small spherical mirror placed opposite this point concentrates the luminous-flux reflected from the interior of the // hemisphere upon the photometer plate and at the same time screens it from the direct rays of the lamp under test . This device shows less error due to absorption of light by nonluminous parts in the case of large luminaires than with the complete sphere . Such light-sources are placed in the plane of the opening of the hemisphere . The integration of the light in a searchlight beam is also performed to advantage by projecting it into such an hemisphere . 52 . Photometric Standards . As the name of the unit of lightintensity indicates , the earliest standard of light was a candle . It was natural that , when other illuminants began to replace the candle , their luminous intensity should be specified in terms of the familiar light-source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photometry as a more exact science , it was found that even at its best the candle was a variable standard . Other flame lamps then were introduced as working standards , though a candle of specified dimensions , composition , and other characteristics still theoretically remained the fundamental standard . With the improvement of the incandescent lamp it became evident that with the aid of precision voltmeters and ammeters , much more reliable and reproducible standards could be made from such lamps than in any other way . After much conference and comparison , a certain arbitrary value of luminous intensity approximating the average value of the former standard candle was selected as the " international candle . " This was agreed upon by the United States , England , France , Italy , Japan , and many other countries , but not by Germany , which adhered to its own former standard , the Hefner . This is 0.9 of an international candle . The Bureau of Standards at Washington and the similar standardizing bodies of the other countries mentioned , each has a group of standardized lamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is maintained . Comparisons among the lamps of each group and occasional comparisons between the different groups insure a practically unchanging standard of luminous intensity the world over . From these lamps , by . means of the distribution-curve method , another group of lamps is standardized as lumen-stand102 MODERN LIGHTING ards . These in turn are used in spherical photometers to produce lumen-standards for general use . An important part of the work of the Bureau of Standards is the supplying of incandescent lamps for use as standards of candle power and lumens to manufacturers and to users of lamps . The cost of such lamps is so small that at least three should always be kept on hand for intercomparison and checking . It is preferred practice to supply candle-power standards for use in rotators in order to avoid possible changes in candle power which are due to change in the shape of the filament . Since , when operated at a fixed voltage the candle power of a lamp is continually decreasing , primary standard lamps should be used only for the standardization of secondary working standards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare them for standardization , lamps are run for from 50 to 100 hours . This carries them past a period when their candle power often changes rapidly and irregularly . This operation is called " aging . " Since the candle power of a standard lamp is determined by the voltage and current , and since a small change in voltage or current makes a much larger change in candle power , it is obviously important that the accuracy of the meters be thoroughly established . It is well to read both current and voltage , as this furnishes checks upon both the instruments and upon the constancy of the resistance and thus of the performance of the lamps . CHAPTER VI LUMINAIRES AND LIGHTING SYSTEMS 53 . Introduction . From the use of the candlesticks and whaleoil lamps of our grandfathers to the array of systems and devices used to-day in connection with lighting is a long step to take in three generations . No comprehensive discussion of the subject may be attempted here , and the reader who is interested in going more deeply into it is referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footnotes . Particular attention is called to A Code of Luminaire Design , a committee report published by the Illuminating Engineering Society ; and also to the Transactions of that Society . 54 . General and Local Lighting . The first and most important classification of interior lighting is into general and local . Lighting is local when the lamps are placed close to the objects to be illuminated . By this method high values of illumination may be obtained over small areas with the use of small lamps . Until recently the high cost of light and the small size of ' light-sources made this the only practicable illumination for fine work . This system is now generally suitable for use only where a small number of well-lighted points in a room are needed or when very high intensities are required for extra fine work . There is danger of excessive contrast with the surrounding area , and of glare , especially when many lamps are used . Even so , as will be explained later , there are many locations where the best effects are obtained with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform illumination over the whole area of the room by means of luminaires placed near the ceiling . The development of large light-sources with low operating cost has made this system generally practicable for rooms where numbers of workers are distributed over the floor . 103 // Some of the advantages of general lighting over local are : the whole floor is illuminated so that work can be done at any point ; troublesome shadows are eliminated ; danger of glare is reduced ; the luminaires are up out of the way of breakage and theft ; the large lamps are more efficient , and the light is whiter ; there are fewer lamps to clean and maintain , and the cost of replacement is less than where many local lamps are used ; the appearance of the room is better . General lighting is , of course , the only method of lighting cer tain classes of rooms , where numbers of people gather , such as auditoriums , hotel lobbies , railway stations , schoolrooms , and many other places . With regard to the degree of uniformity de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum value of illumination on the desks in a schoolroom shall not be more than four times the minimum . The minimum is of course to be not less than the lowest value which is approved for the given case . Combinations of local and general lighting are made in two ways . First , where high intensities , such as 25 foot-candles or more ( 270 lux ) for extra fine work like engraving or watchmaking have to be provided , special local lamps very close to the work and carefully shaded , are used . Again , where some point in a room needs a par ticularly high illumination , the luminaires on the ceiling may be rearranged or increased in number over that point . 55 . Direct , Semi-indirect , and Indirect Lighting . Among light ing installations are found two diametrically opposite methods . In the one , the light from the lamp and its associated opaque re flector is all thrown directly upon the surface to be illuminated . In the other , the light from the lamp and its reflector is first thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the surface where it is used . Between these two extremes are found gradations of relative proportions of light received directly and by reflection . Dr. Luckiesh has 1 suggested a terminolLUMINAIRES // ogy giving the percentage of downward-directed luminous flux followed by the percentage of upward-directed , as specifying the character of the luminaire . Thus for the opaque , downward-directed reflector this ratio would be 100-0 , while for the opaque upward-directed it would be 0-100 . If the luminaire is a downward-directed translucent reflector , this ratio ranges from about 80-20 to 60-40 . An inclosing globe makes the ratio about 50-50 usually with the first figure the greater , while an inverted translucent re flector generally gives between 35-65 and 10-90 . The common naming of these systems is not very logical from the point of view of the results produced . The method which throws all the light upon the ceiling is definitely and appropriately named the indirect system . The method which uses an inverted translucent reflector , with or without a clear glass top , is called semi-indirect , while all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view of the percentage specification suggested above , the indirect system gives 0-100 , the semi-indirect , generally between 10-90 and 35-65 , the direct , generally between 50-50 and 100-0 . These relations are illustrated in Fig. 50 . In comparing the use of these different systems for general lighting , the surroundings and the conditions under which the system will operate , will have great influence upon the decision . In a building where the ceiling is necessarily so dark that it is use-less to try to light it up , an opaque downward-directed reflector will of course be used . Many mill-buildings are examples of this . Where , however , the ceiling can be kept nearly white it is generally conceded that at least enough light should be thrown up so that the upper part of the room will not appear dark . As will be explained // later , wherever appearance is important , glass generally is used , and the style of unit will depend upon individual taste and upon the need for avoiding downward-directed brightness . Luminaires throwing more than half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still more , indirect units , should never be used unless the ceiling is of a light color , preferably a very light yellow and unless it also can be kept reasonably clean . These types also demand a high grade of maintenance for the luminaires themselves because their position promotes the collection of dust . The usual low brightness values and good diffusion of the semi-indirect and of the indirect systems are generally pleasing , though there is a possibility of overdoing diffusion to the point where there is not enough shade and shadow . The unilluminated lower side of the indirect unit is not always pleasing , but this objection is absent where the indirect lighting is from concealed sources . For these types of lighting sufficient space between the ceiling and the lamps to give a good spread to the light is very important . The greater this distance , the more uniform will be the ceiling illumination . This makes indirect units suspended from the ceiling impracticable in low rooms . It is quite possible to get excessive brightness on the ceiling if the lamps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by supporting the indirect units from the floor in the tops of portable lamps , on furniture , or on ornamental columns . This is well illustrated by Figs. 57 and 58 , which show a room lighted by an ordinary table lamp and then by the same lamp with an inverted reflector in the top of the shade . For good appearance , the cut-off shadow on the walls or ceiling should not be sharp . It is generally better if it can come just at the edge of the ceiling . // 56 . Classification of Luminaires . While not complete , the following classification will give a general survey of the field : // 57 . Opaque Reflectors . Opaque reflectors used for general lighting are suitable for very dark ceilings , and ceilings high above the luminaires . They are used frequently in other cases because of their cheapness and durability . Where there is much light-colored material in the room , enough light may be reflected by it , so that the ceiling will not appear too dark . Generally , in rooms used for industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome this disadvantage an enameled steel dome with openings in the top , which are covered with diffusing glass may be used . In order to give satisfaction from the point of view of glare , the reflector rim must come down far enough below the lamp , that is , the " angle of cut-off " must be great enough , so that those luminaires which ordinarily come into the field of view will not expose the filament . The angle of cut-off is defined as the angle between // the horizontal and the highest ray from the filament which just clears the edge of the reflector . This is shown in Fig. 51 . It has been found that an angle of 171 degrees is satisfactory in this respect . A much greater angle than this results in loss of light through cross-reflection within the bowl and reduces the horizontal component of the flux , which is generally needed to illuminate vertical surfaces . Because of the less amount of internal cross-reflection , a rather shallow reflector of large diameter is more efficient than a deeper one of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The large diameter also makes visible at small angles with the horizontal more of the interior surface , and thus gives a greater horizontal component . As a result of these advan-tages the large-diameter reflector known as " the dome " is generally superseding the small , deep reflector known as a " deep bowl . " Evidently the requirement with regard to cut-off eliminates the flat or shallow reflector from good design . This preference for a large diameter has given an advantage to the metal over the mirrored glass reflector for most cases , since the cost of glass goes up rapidly with increased diameter . // On the other hand , this advantage , so far as efficiency is con cerned , is partly offset by the higher reflection coefficient of the mirror surface , the per cent of the produced light that leaves the reflector being 70 as against 75 for the steel dome , and 84 for the extensive type prismatic glass reflector . The 75 per cent for the steel dome given above is for a high grade of enamel . Evidently the efficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this surface . On account of the importance to industrial and similar lighting of this type of reflector , a set of specifications for them was drawn up by the Engineer ing Department of the National Lamp Works of the Gen eral Electric Com pany . These include such items as a min imum diameter of 12 to 20 inches , a maximum angle of cut-off of 171 ? , a minimum reflection factor for the en-amel of 70 per cent , and other features . For such a reflector , the trade letters " RLM " was copyrighted , and only manufacturers whose product comes up to this standard are given permission to employ this trade name . The name is now extensively used and guarantees to the user a high-grade reflector . One of these provided with a diffusing white-glass neck to throw some light to the upper part of the room is shown in Fig. 53 , while still another type , fitted with an inclosing globe of diffusing glass and known as " glassteel " is shown in Fig. 54 . The use of any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciates so rapidly . The angle reflector , as its name implies , is designed to throw the light to one side . It is mounted frequently along the walls of mills // and shops , and is useful especially where light is needed on some particular vertical surface , as on the front of a row of furnaces . The more specular the reflection , the more accurately can the flux of light be controlled as to direction and distribution . With a mat interior , the shape of the reflector will have little effect on the distribution . Small reflectors of aluminum or plated metal are often found on lamps used for local lighting . Perhaps they should be classed as shades rather than reflectors , because the interior finish generally becomes tarnished and is seldom effectively repolished . In such cases , however , there is frequently too much contrast between the brightly lighted area and the surroundings , so that the loss of some of the light may not be a serious matter . The inverted opaque reflector for indirect lighting is a somewhat special case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that small silvered glass reflectors closely fitting the lamp and coming but little above the filament are generally used . These are usually concealed from below by an ornamental metal bowl that plays no part in the illumination . Sometimes this bowl is of dense opal glass with a special small lamp above it to light it up . 58 . Translucent Reflectors . This type combines transmission of light with reflection . Unless a material with a glazed and permanent surface such as glass or porcelain is used , it is better to classify it as a shade rather than a reflector . Even if a material with a porous surface is of light color to begin with , its reflection factor will rapidly decrease because of physical and chemical changes , and because of dust and dirt which can not be removed easily . // The characteristics of the glass used for reflectors have been discussed in the last chapter , as was also the phenomenon of total reflection , which makes possible the use of clear prismatic glass . The possibility of controlling the relation of the reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct reflectors , is much more so with semi-indirect bowls . The efficiency of the unit is dependent upon this control , since the downward-transmitted light , not having to suffer reflection loss at the ceiling , is all effective for illumination . Again , the brightness is determined by this same downward-directed flux , which , therefore , must be held to a lower value than otherwise might be desirable . A 35-per cent transmission is already the limit of satisfactory brightness . Thus a compromise between brightness and efficiency must be made . For further data on brightness of luminaires see ? 11 . With translucent as with opaque reflectors , the ability to control definitely the direction of the reflected light depends upon the character of the surface . Thus the prismatic reflector , in which the reflection is almost entirely specular , gives the best control . It can be designed to concentrate the light , as in the focusing type , or to spread it widely , as in the extensive type , or to give it only a moderate spread , as in the intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reflector , the prisms here serving simply to produce total reflection . 59 . Globes . A globe may be looked upon as a translucent reflector closed at the bottom . Its greatest advantage over the reflector is the elimination of high brightness in the downward direction . The efficiency of the best opal globes is approximately the same as that of deep-bowl opal reflectors of medium density , which is about 82 per cent . The materials are the same as those used for reflectors . Here , however , the object is to have a large proportion of the light transmitted , and as little as possible reflected . Part of the light that is reflected from the inside of a globe will leave it at another point , but part must be reflected a second time , and so on indefinitely . Every time reflection takes place , some of the light is absorbed . A good globe , then , is one in which a large fraction of the // light passes through the glass the first time it strikes it , but which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a minimum variation in brightness between different parts of the surface . To accomplish these two ends calls for much skill in glass making . The ratio of the least bright to the bright est square inch maybe taken as a measure of the quality of the diffusion of a globe or reflector . With globes showing equally good diffusion the absorption may vary from 15 per cent to as much as 50 per cent . In con sidering efficiency , the absorp tion by the holder and by other metal parts must be taken into account . By providing a good reflecting surface at such points several per cent in the net effi ciency sometimes may be gained . Some control of the direc tion of the flux of light from a white-glass globe can be ob tained through the relation of the horizontal and vertical di mensions . Thus a globe with a long vertical dimension will give a horizontal component somewhat greater than the vertical , while a flat globe of large horizontal dimension will give a vertical candle power nearly double the horizontal . Prismatic glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vertical set to produce diffusion and a horizontal set , of which each prism is especially designed , to redirect the light by refraction into the desired direction . In globes for interior lighting the vertical diffusing corrugations are on the inside , and the horizontal directing // prisms on the lower part of the outside . The upper part is provided with totally reflecting prisms , as seen in Fig. 55 . In refractors for street lighting there are two separate glass bowls , one inside the other . The inner one is smooth on the inside with the horizontal directing prisms on the outside , while the outside bowl has the vertical corrugations on the inside and offers a smooth exterior . These two bowls are held together by a cap and are supplied with dust-tight gaskets . A prismatic unit is thus produced which is smooth , both inside and out , as in Fig. 56 . In the example here shown , the use of vertical directing prisms instead of the diffusing corrugation , is illustrated . By this means an asymmetric distribution for street lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe is the only practicable method of considerably increasing symmetrically the horizontal component of the luminous flux . The ventilation of globes used with large lamps has received considerable study , and it is now well established that it has no appreciable influence upon the temperature of the lamp filament , that it may actually raise the temperature of the socket through transfer of the heated air to the upper part of the luminaire , and that at times it considerably in-creases depreciation through influx of dust-laden air . The aim at present , therefore , is to have globes as dust-tight as practicable . 60 . The Esthetic Aspects of Reflectors and Globes . In con nection with globes and translucent reflectors consideration of aesthetic effect first comes to the front . With white-glass reflectors // and globes , however , the aesthetic quality is negative rather than positive . Such a luminaire may be designed so that it does not particularly detract from the beauty of an office , a store , or a schoolroom , but it hardly will be counted as a work of art , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In at least three cases , however , reflectors or globes do enter well into the field of sthetics . The inverted translucent reflector for semi-indirect lighting , flashed 1 white on the inside for reflection , tinted , or decorated on the outside , and with an artistic suspension , is capable of very beautiful effects . Occasionally a suspended lantern may qualify as both efficient and artistic , though usually beauty comes at the expense of efficiency , and sometimes the device becomes only an internally illuminated work of art with negligible light-output . Such an object is worthy in proportion to its artistic merit alone . The third case is that of the portable luminaire with a reflector similar to that described above for semi-indirect lighting , but set to direct the light downward . It would appear that this type of table lamp which gives the efficiency of a good reflector with artistic external appearance has not been developed as much as it deserves . Such a reflector must be of low transmitting characteristics . Only as much light should be transmitted as is necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the point of view of the production and use of illumination , shades and screens which do not combine also the function of reflectors have little or no cause to exist , but from the esthetic standpoint they may be amply justified . Indeed one hardly would find upon the market a device claiming to be a shade or screen , as distinguished from a reflector , which did not make claims to artistic merit . On the other hand , it probably would not be an overstatement to say that many thousands of dollars worth of light is wasted every year through the use of devices , that whatever they may be called , deserve no other name than screens . Attention already has been directed to the small metal reflectors with painted or plated interior , which , // after some months of inattention , largely cease to fulfill their original purpose . Another common source of loss is the scrap of paper or other material that is hung on to the bare lamp to protect the eyes of the worker . In either case a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighting system would give improved illumination at less cost . However a shade or screen of art glass , parchment , or silk , which has a really beautiful design and coloring , may justify itself as a work of art , even if it provides for illumination only a small fraction of the light produced . More money often is spent for objects of art which add less to the beauty and charm of a room than does the really artistic luminaire . There is , however , nothing impracticable about lighting any room where only a moderate general illumination is required by the use of shaded portable and wall brackets , especially if a little indirect illumination is provided from some concealed source . In this connection mention may be made of a portable luminaire which combines a highly efficient indirect-lighting reflector in the top with an artistic shade , lighted with one or more separate lamps below the indirect unit . By this device either or both indirect and direct light can be obtained at will , and by using more or less of the lower lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade may be produced . This luminaire is shown in Figs. 57 and 58 . Portables are further discussed in ? 115. 62 . Luminaires for Two or More Separate Lights . Such luminaires had their natural origin long ago in the days of very small light-sources , where a considerable amount of light could be obtained only by the multiplication of lights . It is told that in 1817 a celebration of Washington 's birthday in Washington Hall , Philadelphia , had for illumination , two thousand wax candles . Because of the pleasure , somewhat barbaric , which the eye takes in a multiplicity of small light-sources ; occasionally , because of the real artistic value that is attained by their use ; and sometimes because the sale of brass is more profitable to the arbiters of fashion in luminaires , than is the sale of glass , this type has outlived the practical need for its use . Unfortunately many of those who // make this type of luminaire , and more who sell them , have little knowledge of , and less interest in , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this statement . As the design of such luminaires is really a question of art and not of illumination , little need be said of them here , further than to emphasize that the principles that have already been laid down hold for each individual light on such a luminaire . Also , from the point of view of illumination , two common shortcomings may be mentioned . One is the use of insufficiently shaded lamps , so that objectionable glare is produced . Frosting is not enough protection for the modern incandescent lamp . Where the candle-type of socket is used , this fault can be remedied very well by the use of small tinted candle shades . The second fault lies in the use of the chandelier , which placed in the center of the ceiling produces a hopeless situation from the point of view of both the usefulness of the light and the aesthetic effect of the room . 63 . Introduction . The quantitative design of lighting installation is of very recent development . Until the coming of the highintensity illuminants of the present day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find their way about but not much more . With local lighting the problem was to get the work close enough to the light so as to obtain the necessary illumination . Any man 's judgment was as good as the next man 's with regard to the design of his lighting . The idea of calculation in connection with illumination thus has been slow of adoption . At present , however , it is gaining ground more rapidly , and there is reason to hope that to another generation the words lumen and foot-candle will sound less strange than they do to the ears of to-day . 64 . The Point-by-Point Method . The point-by-point method depends upon two laws of light that have been discussed in ? ? 7 and 8 ; these are the inversesquare law and the cosine law . Applying these to the calculation of the illumination produced by a light-source giving C candles upon a surface at distance D and normal to the ray of light , as in Fig. 59 , we have the illumination I = C/D2 . If the 121 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of incidence ( 3 , as in Fig. 60 , then , according to the cosine law , I = ( C/D2 ) cos ( 3 . The candle power to be used must be obtained for the proper angle on the distribution curve of the lamp or luminaire employed . Where the illumination sought is that on a horizontal surface at distance , d , from the perpendicular under the light , and when the height of the light above the surface is h , as in Fig. 61 , then evidently D = ' Vh2+d2 , cos ( 3 = h/D , and another is that of street lamps where there are no illuminated buildings to produce reflection ; others are head lamps , searchlights , and flood lights . With these projection types , the law holds only near the center of the beam . ' Where there are several light-sources , their combined illumination is equal to the sum of their separate values . For obtaining the illumination over considerable areas this method is tedious , even when reflection conditions make it possible . 65 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for general illumination , depends primarily upon the law that one lumen per square foot gives an illumination of one While this law applies theoretically only to point sources , it holds within a satisfactory limit of error for any distances greater than ten times the diameter of the source . The method is accurate , however , only when there is no reflection from surrounding surfaces . This condition greatly limits its usefulness as a practical method , since there are few cases where reflection may be ? neglected . One well - know n case is the photometer-bar ; // foot-candle , ' or one lumen per square meter , an illumination of one lux . It also makes use of the fact that a given type of luminaire , installed under given conditions as to the ratio of room-height to horizontal dimensions and as to the reflection factors of ceiling and walls , can be counted on to deliver a rather definite percentage of its total lumens to the working surface below . This percentage ratio is called the utilization-coefficient . It is further discussed in 66 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed illumination is then as follows . The area to be lighted in square feet , multiplied by the specified illumination in foot-candles gives the net lumens to be furnished . This , divided by the coefficient of utilization of the luminaire which it has been decided to use , gives the total lumens to be provided by all the units . The coefficient used must be based on conditions of mini-mum efficiency . Since , due to dust and dirt , the light given by any luminaire falls off continually until such time as it is cleaned , it is necessary to install enough additional lamp capacity to compensate for this reduction in light-giving power . For this purpose a factor 2 greater than unity and generally lying between 1.3 and 1.5 is used as a multiplier . This is the depreciation-factor . The product so obtained is then the total flux to be developed . Next must be decided the number of luminaires that are to be used . This must be great enough so that the illumination produced will be satisfac torily uniform . The flux-of-light method is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always important and may be , as in cases of industrial lighting , the dominating factor . Complete data on this point are not available , but one authority gives ratios of spacing distance to height above the working plane for different types of units as follows : dome re flectors-1.2 ; inclosing glass units or globes-1.0 ; semi-indirect and indirect-1.0 to 1.5 , depending on the fineness of the work to be done . It is usual to assume the working plane at " table height " or 22 feet ( 75 centimeters ) above the floor . If higher benches are to be used , the proper figures for their height should be taken . The degree of uniformity evidently will depend not only upon the // type of luminaire but also upon the character of the ceiling . Thus , before the spacing is determined , the mounting height , or for indirect units , the ceiling height , must be settled . In high rooms , the mounting height should generally be not less than ten feet , ( 3 meters ) above the floor . Higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increases the permissible spacing or gives more uniform illumination . For the sake of appearances , especially in high rooms , it is often desirable to drop the luminaires two feet ( 60 cm. ) or more from the ceiling . As the height of the room increases , the drop also should be increased , but it should be not more than about 20 per cent of the height . In addition to the requirement for uniform illumination , the plan of a beamed ceiling and the dimensions of the room are fac-tors in deciding the number of luminaires . It is of course better from the point of view of uniformity to have too many rather than too few . With the help of the lamp data given in ? 28 or in lists obtainable from the manufacturers , the size of lamp can be deter-mined , based on the quotient of the total lumens required , divided by the number of lamps . To express the preceding discussion in the form of an equation , we may write 66 . The Coefficient of Utilization . As stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to total light produced . Extensive tests 1 have been carried on by Messrs . Ward Harrison and E. A. Anderson to determine the values of this coefficient for a considerable number of luminaires and under a wide variety of room dimensions and wall-reflection factors . For a given ceiling height the coefficient of utilization increases with the horizontal dimension of the room ; for small rooms it increases rapidly ; for larger rooms it increases more slowly . This is due to the fact that in the larger room relatively less light falls upon the walls to be absorbed by them . For given length and width the // coefficient decreases with increased height at first rapidly , then more slowly for high rooms . This decrease is due to the fact that the flux , especially in a small room , does not follow exactly parallel paths . The illumination , however , is far from according with the inverse-square law . Thus in one case , with an RLM opaque reflector , increasing the height from six to twelve feet ( 2 to 4 meters ) decreases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent for dark-walled rooms . Table XIII gives examples of coefficients of utilization for several typical luminaires and for various dimensions of rooms and values of reflection coefficient . 67 . Components of Depreciation . Depreciation can be resolved into four components : ? decreased lumens of the lamp itself , dirt on the lamp , dirt on the globe or reflector , and dirt on the ceiling . As explained in ? 24 , the lumen output of all constant-potential lamps decreases rather uniformly . This is unavoidable , and during the life of the lamp results by itself in a depreciation-factor of about 1.25 for Mazda B and 1.10 for Mazda C lamps , which must be combined with the components due to the dirt . Dirt on the lamp usually should not be a serious factor on account of its protected position . This statement evidently does not always apply to the case of indirect and semi-indirect luminaires . What dirt there is on the lamp , however , is particularly troublesome because all the light must pass through it ; observation will show that many lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on the globe or reflector will produce very different results , depending upon its location and also upon the surroundings of the luminaire . Thus , on the top of a reflector hung under a dark ceiling , dirt would produce little effect ; this also would be true when the dirt was on the underside of a dense semiindirect reflector . Again , the character of the dirt is sometimes important . For instance , dust on an open prismatic reflector will affect its efficiency but slightly , while oily dirt will reduce it considerably . In general the part in the depreciation-factor which the globe or reflector will play is dependent upon three things : first , the condition under which the luminaire is operating as to dust and dirt , second , the type of luminaire , and third , the economic period // between cleanings . An extended study I of this subject by Earl A. Anderson and James M. Ketch showed variation in depreciation for different locations with different types of luminaires summa-rized in the following table : Some tests 2 made in school buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used , gave depreciation-factors over a three-month period varying from 1.30 to 1.65 ; this depended upon the location and whether the building was new or old . Different types of luminaires were tested in the clean , dry , factory room mentioned above , over a period of four months , and the following depreciation-factors , among others , were found : Deep bowls , dense opal glass , prismatic glass , and enameled Table // These figures show not only the variation with different types of luminaires , but also very clearly the bad effect of the unnecessary ventilating holes sometimes placed in the bottom . They also show the increased depreciation resulting from the bowl-enameled lamp in the RLM dome , and the lower depreciation where semiindirect units are covered with clear glass . It will be noted that in the latter case the reflected light passes through only one top layer of dust and the direct light penetrates one thin bottom layer . On the other hand , if there is no cover , all the light passes through one layer on the lamp ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the bowl twice , while the direct light passes through this layer once , as well as through the thin bottom layer . 68 . Economic Cleaning Period . The preceding section discussed the effect of location and of type of unit on the depreciationfactor . There remains to be considered the matter of economic period between cleanings . It will be assumed that a regular system of cleaning is carried out , designed to give illumination at minimum cost . This , however , is not the usual condition . One authority has estimated that more than 30 per cent of the light produced in the United States is wasted needlessly through lack of attention to maintenance . This means a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars . While such a loss is evident , it is also apparent that too frequent cleaning would entail loss through excessive labor cost . There must be then some period of cleaning for each case , which will result in a minimum cost for light . Evidently this will be longer for lower depreciation rates , as well as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily accessible or of high wages . The period also will be longer as the cost of electric power and of lamps becomes lower . This discussion always assumes that the minimum value to which the illumination falls is adequate ; that is , that the proper depreciation-factor has been applied in designing the installation . The determination of this economic period is complicated by the fact that the rate of depreciation is not uniform . Thus in the case of the Columbus Schools the depreciation during the last fifteen weeks was approximately equal to that of the first three weeks . In the case of large installations , however , the // effort needed to make an economic study of this period can be amply justified . This may be done by plotting two curves , one of the annual cost of light lost against the length of cleaning period , the other , the corresponding annual cost of cleaning . Where the sum of these is a minimum , the abscissa gives the length of the economic period . 69 . The Ceiling as a Part of the Lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the lighting system , it must be remembered that all the light from an indirect reflector has to reach its destination by way of the ceiling and that even with a globe , almost half of the light is intrusted to its reflecting power ; therefore it does not seem unreasonable to include the ceiling in the lighting system . The extent to which the ceiling , and to a lesser degree the walls , take part in supplying the illumination to the working surface obviously varies greatly with the type of luminaire used . This is well shown in the table of utilization coefficients in ? 66 . Thus , with very dark walls , changing the ceiling from a 70 per cent to a 30 per cent reflection factor , makes practically no change in the light from an RLM dome , but about 15 per cent decrease for a light-density opal reflector , 20 per cent decrease for a flattened globe , and 60 per cent decrease for an indirect reflector . If these figures be taken to represent darkening due to dirt , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1.25 , and 2.5 for the effect produced by the soiling of the ceiling alone . Similar data can be derived from the tables to show the effect of the walls . Such data demonstrate the importance of careful attention to the maintenance of the reflection factor of the ceiling by means of periodic painting and cleaning . There are two quite distinct causes for the decrease in the reflection factors of painted surfaces ? a change in the paint itself and the collection of dirt and dust . The change in the paint varies with the composition of the paint and is said to be due principally to the inevitable yellowing of linseed oil when used as a vehicle for the pigment . When some other vehicle is used , this depreciation is not always so rapid . The collection of dirt and dust is not affected by the composition of the paint except as this determines
