T HE attitude of the average American toward Cuba 's troubles is the attitude of the newspaper reader whose views can not crystallize because he lacks assimilable information . Because we have intervened before , the possibility of being obliged to intervene again can not be ignored . It is safe to say that the American people at large do not approve of our looking for trouble in other countries . We have more than enough problems of our own to solve . If we are to carry the benefits of the New Deal beyond our boundaries , it should consist of minding our own business instead of making ourselves unpopular with our neighbors . The newspapers for months have carried more cabled news from Cuba than at any time since the Spanish-American War . Indeed , so much has been printed that people are confused by what they read rather than enlightened . President Roosevelt 's desire to do everything possible to win the good will of Latin America accurately reflects the wishes of the majority of Americans . We do not want Latin America 's hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider are : Does the anti-American feeling , which , we are told , is general in Latin America , also exist in Cuba ? If Cuba has grievances , what are they ? Is American intervention today either desired or feared by the Cubans ? Is it necessary for the protection of American life and property in Cuba ? Is Cuba 's economic plight as serious as the holders of sugar stocks and the Cuban propagandists would have us believe ? Is Communism spreading in Cuba , as reported ? Does Cuba have a race problem ? To obtain answers to these questions direct from Cubans and to check up on those answers on the ground , it was necessary to go to Cuba . There is no question that our financial interest in Cuba is much greater than the average American realizes . We have invested there almost . $1,500 , - 000,000 . More than half of it is in sugar properties . More than $600,000,000 are invested in real estate , railroads , public utilities , in various industries , mines , tobacco , commercial enterprises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excess of 3100,000,000 of various Cuban bonds . Under normal conditions , the capital thus invested in a foreign country should return better than 6 per cent per annum  --  that is to say , around $90,000,000 a year . We are opposed to helping out the big New York banks responsible for the Cuban loans , after the revelations in Washington . But no country on earth can view without . concern the loss of an income of $90,000,000 or more a year by its citizens . Nations have gone to war for less . Aside from all moral or legal reflections based on the caveat emplar formula , it certainly is not good business to treat lightly the prospect of seeing this investment become a permanent loss . The loss would not fall on a few rich speculators in Wall Street , but on many thousands of Americans who hold Cuban securities of all kinds . Considering the shrinkage in our income from investments at home , the resumption of returns from our Cuban investments would help greatly . Do n't forget : More than $90,000,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write off our losses and keep out hereafter . During the decade preceding our stock-market crash , we sold to Cuba an average of between $150 , - 000,000 and $200,000,000 a year in goods . At the peak , in 1920 , our exports exceeded 3395,000,000 . In 1926 , our sales to Cuba amounted to 3160,000,000 . In 1932 , they were barely $28,000,000 . For exports everywhere to drop because of the world depression was to be ex-pected . But experts assert . that the magnitude of the Cuban decrease was due to a shortsighted tariff policy on our part . By combining the losses of income from our investments and of the profits from our exports , we get a sum great enough to pay the interest on some billions of our newly created bonded indebtedness , which has to come from American taxpayers . The Cuban problem , therefore , touches the American pocketbook to an extent not realized by many . There is also the sentimental side to our relations with Cuba . The Cubans assert that it is not sentimental enough to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foster child , separated from us by a scant ninety miles of sapphirine sea . From time to time , our own economists who study our pension figures remind us that we are paying close to one hundred millions a year because Americans fought that Cuba might be free . That is why Cuba 's problem has never ceased to be , at least in part , America 's . We inherited it as we did other headaches when we decided to take up the white man 's burden in the Philippines and elsewhere . Our disinterestedness has been questioned , but there has never been , in our time , any real desire for annexation or for a protectorate . Imperialism was not even a name to our Navy at Santiago or to Dewey at Manila . It was not Imperialism that made a Rough Rider president of the United States , or that induced American investors to part with $1,500,000,000 of their savings in Cuba . But Latin American stump speakers always harp on " Yankee imperialism . " What the Cubans Think of Intervention I INTERVIEWED all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in December . With the exception of a few radical politicians , all the white and near-white Cubans that I spoke to denied that there was any anti-American feeling in Cuba . They said : " Not at all ! On the contrary ! " And immediately proceeded to tell me that the misdeeds of the Gran San Martin government made it the inescapable duty of the United States to end the despotism . Clearly , therefore , it was not that they loved Americans more but that they liked the student government less , and saw no other way of ending the rule of a clique that governed at the point of the bayonet . Negotiations , diplomatic and otherwise , had failed . When I asked why they all wished me to report that most Cubans demanded intervention , but invariably declined to sign their names to a petition asking for it , they answered that it would not be prudent to do so  --  and that the actual government had no right to proclaim impossible laws  --  unconstitutional measures in the form of presidential decrees by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonentities willed it . Cuba was being pushed over the precipice by inexperienced hot-heads who knew nothing of statesmanship. less of business and still less of Cuba 's real problems . Every chance of recovery , I was assured , was being killed by the ukases of a smirking czar . If I were a Cuban , I dare say I also would advocate intervention as the only way to solve the problem of the supporting troops . Without the army , the government could not last a week . That is how they felt about intervention . A few politicians , better psychologists than the pauperized merchants and the starving planters , suggested that instead of intervention  --  a word of sinister connotations  --  what Cuba really needed was our " friendly coLiperation . " Mr. Sumner Welles , our ambassador , anxious to avoid anything that might wound Cuban sensibilities , contrived to put an end to the intolerable conditions under Machado by " inducing " the former president to resign . The conventions were observed . All shades of political opinion in Cuba shared in what was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessor of a historical name , a man of unblemished reputation , became the provisional president .. Spanish America applauded amazedly . Never before had American diplomacy showed such tact and big-sticklessness south of the Rio Grande . For once , no fault was found with the friendly offices of the poker-playing Colossus of the North . It looked , in August , as though Cuba 's troubles were over . All parties were represented in the new cabinet , and the New Deal , direct from Washington , was to be a square deal . Cubans ceased to kill and be killed , and began to hope . The hope lasted three weeks . The September revolution overthrew the Cespedes government . It was the work of quick-witted anti-American students who saw that the door of the palace was open and walked in . They cleverly turned a mutiny of soldiers , who did not wish to have their pay cut , into a means of defense and offense , without which the student rule could not last a week . Why Washington . Says " Hands Off " rr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass into inexperienced hands , knowing what harm hot-headed youngsters and Communistic doctrinaires could do , expected the United States instantly to resent the deliberate flouting of its wishes . But Washington , desirous of avoiding , at any cost , intervention in Cuba on the eve of the Pan-American Conference in Montevideo , contented itself with not recognizing the least representative government ever inflicted on a Spanish-speaking country by a half dozen theorists and a mixed-color army . That was the one time in the history of Cuba when the United States not only was justified in intervening but was morally bound to restore order , dozens of Cubans told me . I agree with them . Dr. Ramon Grau San Martin , the pet of the students who advised him , was chosen president by the revolutionary junta . I suspect that the one alert mind of the little group  --  Sergio CarbO 's  --  recognized the practical value of having an impractical physician for a figurehead . The role of vocal savior came easy to a middle-aged doctor . After the attack on the officers at the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both of which places prisoners were shot down in cold blood after surrendering , I heard everywhere : " This government is worse than Machado 's . Why does n't the United States do something now ? " Even while insisting that there is no hatred of Americans in Cuba , which is not 100 per cent true , all sorts of Cubans blamed Washington for permitting the daily shootings and bombings , for the Communistic decrees that made economic recovery impossible . The American ambassador did his best to help Cuba without recourse to armed intervention . But it is only fair to say that however freely they may express their doubts as to the sincerity and practical value of our friendship in a real crisis , I did not find in Cuba such Yankeephohia as an American finds in Mexico  --  which , in one hundred years , has found many good reasons for hating the gringo  --  or , until the other day , in Argentina , where no cause whatever has existed . Haiti , for instance , can not possibly love us and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where our leathernecks have had to do a little shooting . Friendship for the Americans is professed , officially , by republics that have sold hundreds of millions of defaulting bonds to American investors , but the people of those countries love us about as much as we love them ; which is fair enough . Every Cuban who could talk , and there are no mutes in Cuba , made it clear , at least to me , that the one form of American participation in strictly Cuban affairs of which they could approve consisted of helping the " outs " against tyrannous " ins . " Perfervid opposition to American ingerencia , by which they mean Yankee intrusion into their domestic affairs , has been the perennially popular hokum of all political orators from the birth of the republic . The Platt Amendment gives to the United States the right to intervene for . . . the maintenance of a government adequate for the protRetion of life , property , and individual liberty . . . . " No Cuban politician or officeholder has ever felt sure of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every administration keep uneasy eyes on Washington . The official friendship of the United States was considered indispensable to holding office until some of those in the present governing group shrewdly realized that Uncle Sam , in the person of Franklin D. Roosevelt , actually meant it when he said there would be no intervention unless American lives were lost . That is why the Grau government saw no reason for asking our permission to do what they wished . The more anti-American things they did the more there would be for the United States to undo ; and the more that had to be undone , the greater would be our disinclination to interfere . The more radical members of Grau 's cabinet resigned because the trend to the left was not decided enough . When Washington intimated that the Platt Amendment might be repealed , the reds went back to office and to unchecked Communism . The tirade of Senor Giraudy at Montevideo against our alleged intervention , which consisted of the ambassador listening to the complaints of all classes of Cubans , did not mention the undeniable fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government that . rose to power with the aid of an army of mercenaries . As this is written , it looks as if the Platt Amendment were to go . President Roosevelt has so intimated . One of the real economists in Cuba was good enough to talk to me at length about Cuba 's grievances , actual and imaginary . " You may Lake my word for it that the better classes of Cubans are sincerely pro-American . This does not mean that they believe in annexation , although quite a number think it must come to that some day ; but they are fully aware of the many advantages that would accrue to both countries from a closer and friendlier understanding . You will also find many who , because they can not grasp our own economic problems in their completeness , place the entire blame for all our troubles on your Government . Again , there are other Cubans who seek political popularity by that insincere form of patriotism which consists first of picturing Americans as our enemies and then of opposing every form of American interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I INKING Cubans admit that many of the 1 . troubles for which the United States is blamed are of our own making . Concessions and contracts awarded by Cuban governments to American corporations were not obtained under duress , but simply because our own politicians grafted . The few genuine anti-Americans , on the other hand , insist that our troubles do not arise either from our own grafters or from our business losses . They go back to the very beginning of the change for the worse in our political , social and economic conditions . They compare Cuba with Ireland under absentee landlordism at its worst . The operation of Cuban plantations and mills by foreign capitalists who do not live here  --  first under Spanish rule and later by stock manipulators in New York  --  is at fault . The evil has been aggravated by the economic dependence of Cuba on the American market and by the Platt Amendment , which has made our politicians forget the welfare of Cuba because of their need to have iufluential friends in Washington in order to remain in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the transfer of the land from individual Cuban owners to huge American companies . This has created labor conditions so appalling that for a parallel we have to go back to the days of Negro slavery and coolie labor . They claim Cuba today has but two classes : The exploited and the exploiters . The exploited are the native Cubans . The exploiters ( 72 THE SETURDAY EVENING POST January 27,1954 just desperation on his part , but anyway he wanted to invest it all in a theater venture . I went to work on him tike a cyclone . For a while it was touch and go between The Royal Box  --  that was the name of Coglilan 's play  --  and a play that somebody was trying to persuade Liebler to invest . in , starring Go-Wan-Go-Mohawk , the Indian mail carrier , but he finally decided that . Coghlan was a much more dignified proposition  --  which the Lord knows he was  --  and Liebler Co. came into existence . Coghlan 's great prestige was of course , a lot of help in getting together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly long enough to get us to Washington for the opening . It was a grand play and great performances were given , but business was so bad in Washington that when Mr. Erlanger heard of our misery he wired me a considerate offer of a job as advance man again . Friendly people were careful to tell me I was a fool not to take it , but Liebler and I insisted on keeping The Royal Box out on the road for three weeks more , heaven knows how . Then Liebler begged us a three weeks ' booking at the Fifth Avenue Theater in New York , and we trailed into the big town about licked to a frazzle . Right away , of course , the way things often used to happen , the blessed play was a huge success  --  or rather Coghlan was . In three nights we were playing to capacity and Coghlan was proclaimed everywhere the finest actor on the American stage , which he undoubtedly was , although the newspapers bad taken a long time to discover the obvious fact . Scenes Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famine as that play turned out to be . Just when we 'd made up our minds that there were millions in it , a deputy sheriff , the first one of a flock , walked into the box office and attached the receipts for a board bill of Coghlan 's dating back to the time earlier that year when he'd. eloped with a girl named Kuhns Beveridge and married her . It took the wind out of me  --  I 'd been hoping that I 'd seen my last of deputies  --  so I went tearing backstage to have it out with Coghlan . There was only one way to impress him  --  burst in , shout at him , swear at him , get the whole thing off your chest and then exit as fast as possible  --  if you let him get a word . in edgewise he was certain to make a fool of you with his most convincing arguments . I was just . in the mood to do it up brown and I started down the side aisle to go behind the stage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best scene in the play it . was  --  and by instinct I pulled . up to keep from distracting the audience . By the time the curtain came down I 'd forgotten all about any sheriff trouble  --  I just stood there and gaped over Coghlan 's magnificence ; I even joined in the applause . That was the kind of actor he was  --  he could hold me tighter than a dozen deputies could , and yet I 'd seen him play that scene twenty times and knew it backward . I have seen all the great ones of my time and worked with a good many of them , but Charles Coghlan , whose name had formerly always appeared in small type in the billing below Rose COGHLAN 'S , was the greatest . He had everything . He 'd taught Rose all she knew . His invariable rebuke to an actor who was n't reading his lines right was , with a grin : " So like my sister Rosie ! " His sheer ability made it possible for him to get away with murder when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister in Wilde 's A Woman of No Importance one year , but had to leave the rehearsals for a while when the newspapers got too inquisitive about his sensational elopement , and what with honeymooning and such , he did n't remember so very much about the play when he finally turned up in it again . In the scene where the illegitimate son  --  Aubrey Boucicault played the part  --  pleads with his father  --  Coghlan , that was  --  to marry his mother . " You will marry my mother ? " says the boy  --  Wilde had writ ten a couple of hundred words for the father 's answer . The first night Coghlan appeared he just looked at Boucicault for about twenty seconds and then stuck his monocle in his eye with : " I beg your pardon ? " Boucicault took a long breath , and with quite a pause after each word , spoke his line again : " You will marry my mother ? " " Yes , " says Coghlan with a grunt , " but it 's so damned conventional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I say ? " he replied . " Damned long stupid speech ; simply could n't learn it . " That line stayed in the play for the rest of the run . Because of Coghlan 's old debts , we continued to have a steady procession of deputy sheriffs at the box office who endeavored to lick up every cent we could make . We thought we 'd be rid of trouble when we took the play on the road , but Coghlan was famous for being completely indifferent to money . His hotel bill of seven or eight hundred a week put profits out of the question . I know it sounds incredible again , but we really did n't mind very much . He was such a magnificent actor and such an overwhelming person that we were more than paid in full by the sheer joy we took in being associated with him . Those were the days when you could feel that way about the great actors . Still and all , that kind of payment could n't be entered on the books , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke as before . It was tantalizing to have achieved success in everything but profit  --  tantalizing but hopeful to so optimistic a young ass as I. So I played the same system again and bet on another of my admirations when the chance came along  --  Viola Allen , this time . I 'd been crazy about her ever since I 'd first seen her as a child of sixteen playing Esmeralda . Just to give you an idea  --  she is the only important living actress who has never appeared in any but a star or leading lady 's role . When I saw in the indispensable papers that she was leaving the Empire Theater and plan-mug to star on her own , it was good enough for me . This time I was stepping out . When she got my note , she asked me to come and see her ; she was a polite woman . I got . a shoe shine on the way , figuring it might prove a good investment  --  otherwise I was a little seedy , but not conspicuously so . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $6.75 in my pocket was my total capital . Long afterward Viola Allen told me that all the time she was listening to my spellbinding account of what . we would do she couldn't. take her eyes off the high lights on my shoes  --  no doubt she was hypnotized . It seems , too , that my confidence impressed her . She asked me : " How much money are you prepared to lose on the venture , Mr. Tyler ? " ? you see , all the other managers had been telling her they 'd lose any amount to establish her  --  and all I could answer was : " Why , I do n't expect . to lose any . I expect to win from the jump . " It . was no salesman 's line  --  we had to do just that or we were sunk . Dramatizing a Best Seller So we signed a contract on the strength of my forced optimism and started looking for a play . Plenty of plays , but none good enough for us . Finally she mentioned a dramatization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one of the year 's best sellers . I 'd read the book , of course , and had a huge respect for its success , so we had the play in and looked it over . When she said she thought it had possibilities , but would need a lot of reworking , I agreed again . Then we  --  principally she  --  figured out the necessary changes , and it was deCided that she would go to England and put them up to the author . That suited me . She was a very famous and highly intelligent and uncommonly beautiful lady , and I was nobody  --  besides , she had the price of the trip and I had n't . Back she came with all the changes as we wanted them and Hall Caine himself in tow . At first Caine could n't get used to Pullman sleepers . He went to bed in the sleeping ear with everything on but his top hat . Not a jarring note came up until after rehearsals started , however  --  then appeared that faint , troubled look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mentioned . I knew that look only too well  --  I 'd met it often before  --  it meant they were wondering just how much cash there was behind the thing . Not that they said anything  --  their manners were too good  --  but they looked at me . At . length they inquired ever so gently when we were going to open in New York and where . Being the last person who could answer that one , I tactfully dodged the issue . I did n't know anybody who would let us have a New York theater , and I could n't blame them . The only thing I could think of was to go round to Mr. Erlanger and tell him my troubles and ask if he would n't like to have a look at the play . After all , his mere presence at a rehearsal would buck the whole cast up immensely ; he cuainnegsanbedgahne ltiokerdolli.t. and lie bought a third interest in it , and from then on n If now was thirty-odd years ago , I would n't have to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Albany , we broke the house record in Washington , and when wo into into the Knickerbocker Theater in New York we went like a house afire , in spite of the press , which damned us thoroughly , particularly the play  --  Willie Winter on the Tribune called it " The Christian Pill . " Between the third and fourth acts on the opening night I tore myself away from the cheering audience long enough to drop into the box office . I wanted somebody to congratulate me and convince me it was all real . There I found the whole theatrical syndicate sitting in a sort ' of choked silence  --  Charles Frohman , Al Hayman , A. L. Erlanger , and Marc Klaw . Nobody was saying a word , there was nothing to hear but the cheering from inside . Finally All Hayman , Al 's six-foot brother , walked in and said : " Boys , it 's a bigger hit than The Little Minister . " That was their biggest success and to have their biggest success outdone by an independent unknown like Liebler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my first burst of delirium I remember I bet Hayman an overcoat that we 'd play to $15,000 a week as long as we stayed . / won that bet . Good Lord , we won everything . The Christian netted us something like half a million dollars before we were through with it . And the next morning Liebler &; Co. woke up besieged by a whole world that had never before heard of them . Agents , actors , managers , playwrights came swarming round to stand with their hats off and their eyes bulging . We were in . Thousands of dollars began to sprout at the bottom of the weekly balance sheets , thousands on thousands of dollars , and it kept up till we were drowned and gasping . Why , when the company opened in Boston , the following spring , there was a line three times round the block waiting for seats , and the treasurer of the theater fainted from overwork . It washed me clear off my feet . About the only person who could sympathize with the way I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweep . I think the only thing that saved my sanity after the opening was those newspaper reviews that called us so many names  --  they were the only normal touches in a world gone crazy . For years I 'd been telling myself that something like this was going to happen , but I 'd never more than half believed it  --  just daydreaming or nervous habit . or something to keep going on . And now the whole blessed thing had blown up right under my nose , and it was weeks before I could even live sociably with the idea that I was n't somebody else . I did n't know what to make of it , but my creditors did . You bet they did ! cuzaz Pa GREZ.VAINCE , 9 are chiefly American corporations . What native capital there is works hand in glove with the Americans . The investment of some $1,500,000,000 by Americans in Cuba is the popularCuban ( Continued measure of the imperialism that all Americans insist does not exist .. " Before and during the Dance of the Millions , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Page 9 ) worked by calonos who hired men to grow and cut cane which they took to the central , or mill . They were paid according to the market price of raw sugar . About 65 per cent of their land was devoted to sugar . The rest of it was used by the colonos and their workmen to raise food  --  vegetables , pigs , cattle , plantains , chickens , eggs , and so on . From these , the Cuban workers were able to Live between cane crops . Today the Cuban sugar worker can no longer be self-supporting . The high prices during the boom made the colonos plant all the land to cane , with the exception of what was absolutely needed for pasture . Today they can not work the land that formerly fed them . Moreover , the big e , entrales , or mills , of immense capacity , controlled by American corporations , to insure rin adequate supply of cane , started the plantation system . The companies built barracks for the men they hired during the zafra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crop was gathered . Moreover , your experts installed labor-saving machinery and improved technical methods which eliminated many workers and increased unemployment . The laborers the companies imported from Haiti and Jamaica and did not deport , as the law demanded , have competitively forced wages down to as low as ten cents a day . They starve between crops . " Mistakes thus have been made by shortsighted Cubans , but the blunders of the Americans in Cuba  --  bankers and managers and governors  --  are much greater . The appalling shrinkage in the market value of American-owned Cuban securities is not exclusively the result of the world depression . Your promoters paid much too much for our sugar properties . Perhaps they hoped to sell Cuban sugar securities in Wall Street at still greater profits . A stock that sold for as high as $112 on the New York Stock Exchange , later was not wanted at fifty cents a share . There is a long list of similar stocks . " The Sugar Debacle " Your greatest banks sent down to us agents who were not bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ascertain the true commercial situation here or the industrial possibilities of this country . They literally forced money upon the Cubans ; insisted upon lending much more than the borrowers needed  --  always on sugar . They knew nothing about . the sugar industry . Corporations paid high for land which they need not have bought at all under the colono system . Much of the money received by Cubans from these sales was used to build magnificent palaces in Havana . Cubans , like other Latin Americans , do as they have done for hundreds of years . They consider real estate  --  land , houses and mortgages  --  as the safest of all investments . The fact that some Cubans were overpaid for their properties does not help the thousands of colonos and workers who are starving today . The abandonment of a tried system has meant misery for the masses , whoever may be at fault . The plantation system was an American innovation . " In South America , insurance companies backed by foreign capital have done very well . In Cuba there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone are responsible for the fatal increase in the Cuban production of sugar . They shortsightedly made Cuba definitely a one-crop country , depending upon a one-market industry controlled by them . Your investors lost their hundreds of millions and the Cubans their living . " Then you have the excessive rates of the American-owned railroads and the docks and ports , and the merging of public-utility companies into a monopoly , made possible by our politicians . The Chadbourne Plan was another mistake of the American bankers , who wished chiefly to protect bad loans made on sugar collateral . It saddled on our country a debt of $42,000,000 , which has necessitated oppressive taxes . They should have arrived at a mutually helpful understanding with your own sugar producers and they should have fought the Hawley-Smoot Bill , which was devised to help Americans . As a natural consequence of that measure , the production of sugar increased in the United States and your insular possessions , but it killed Cuba . Before the war , raw sugar paid one cent a pound duty . Since 1930 it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure that the duty adds $250,000,000 to your annual sugar bill , with only a slight benefit to American producers . But it also has meant a huge bonus to Puerto Rican , Hawaiian and Philippine growers . The exports of American goods to Cuba , which , during the boom year , 1920 , amounted to over $395,000,000 , have shrunk to $28,000,000 in 1932 . The sugar production from beet and cane in the United States was 23 per cent of your total consumption in 1922 , 14 per cent in 1927 and only 22 per Cent in 1932 . You have your insular possessions to blame for that . Cuban sugar fell from 55 per cent in 1927 to 30 per cent of your total consumption last year . On the other hand , the production of sugar in your island possessions , which , in 1923 , was only 19 per cent of your consumption , ten years later , aided by your tariff , grew to 47 per cent . " Cuba has the best sugar soil in the world . It can produce cheaper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the United States  --  which can never produce all the sugar it consumes . The world production of sugar increased from 20,875,000 tons when the World War began to 28,752,000 tons in 1931 . Cuba , which produced about 3,000,000 tons in 1914 , developed , by reason of the reduced production of beet sugar in Europe during the war , a capacity to produce as high as 5,523,000 tons in 1925 . Our output remained at about 5,000,000 tons yearly until 1931 . In 1932 it dropped to less than 3,000,000 tons . Our annual sales to the United States , which were well above 3,000,000 tons for the years 1922 to 1930 , dropped to 1,762,000 tons in 1932 . The sugar consumption of the United States rose from 5,000,000 tons in 1922 to more than 6,000,000 tons in 1932 . You will see , therefore , that Cuba is selling less than one-half of what it formerly produced and you are using much more than before . " What High Duties Have Done " Expressed in dollars , in 1026 Cuba bought $160,488,000 worth of American goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Hawaii , $76,262,000 of American goods . In 1932 , Cuba bought $28,775,000 ; the Philippines , $44,987,000 ; Puerto Rico , $48,780,000 ; and Hawaii , $58,50-1,000 . The shipments of sugar from your insular possessions to the United States increased from 1,668,789 tons in 1926 to 2,976,381 tons in 1932 , and your sales to your insular possessions decreased from $229,649,000 in 1926 to only $152,271,000 in 1932 . Consider what your high sugar duties have done . Your purchases of sugar from your insular possessions increased by 1,307,592 tons per annum , while your sales to them at the same time decreased by $77,378,000 . In other words , 2,976,381 tons of sugar front Puerto Rico , Hawaii and the Philippines came in duty free , and they 74 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 27. 1934 bought $77,378,000 less of American goods . In the case of poor Cuba , the shipments to the United States dropped 2,231,633 tons and in consequence , you sold to us 5131,713,000 less of American goods . The more you buy from your insular possessions , the less they buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent . of perhaps 540,000,000 a year , you lose three or four times that amount of trade with Cuba . Does that give work to your own mill workers and factories ? Does the shrewd Yankee trader exist only in your fiction ? " Cuba does not ask for her sugar to be admitted duty free . But if you will increase the quota that Cuba is allowed to send to you , say , from the proposed 1,700,000 to 2,500,000 tons . you will receive more than $30,000,000 more in revenue from duties and resume your enormous business with the country that you are now ruining at such a high cost to yourselves . It is not for a Cuban to criticize the behavior of Congress . Secretary Bull wants to develop trade with Latin America . What 's the matter with little Cuba , where American investments are three times greater than in big Brazil ? " Cuba 's Chief Grievance " Statistics , being bare bones , are dry . Negotiations for a new marketing agreement , fixing the quota allowed to Cuba and to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been fair to Cuba . At every step Cuba 's needs have been ignored without correspondingly proportionate advantages to your agriculturists or taxpayers . Cuba has no vote and no voice in the decisions of your Congress . Your investors and your manufacturers will lose hundreds of millions by unfairness to Cuba. , as , for instance , in underestimating your yearly consumption in order to keep down the Cuban quota . It is a long story , and it is the basis for Cuba 's chief grievance today . " On the other hand , it is only fair to admit that some of our economic difficulties have a domestic . political origin for which no American can be blamed . What the Volstead Act did to demoralize your people , the national lottery of Cuba has done for us . Our presidents have made it the chief corrupting medium . It has been used to influence our Congress and our politicians . Political corruption always spreads through all classes of society . It has done so in Cuba . " Apart from the immorality of encouraging gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . During the boom years , 1919 and 1920 , when the average price of tickets was thirty dollars , the lottery collectors made more than 512,000,000 a year . " The government retains 30 per cent of the par value of all tickets sold , and 70 per cent of the receipts are distributed in prizes . The 30 per cent that went to the government never figured in the budget . The government estimated the operating expenses at $1.80 per ticket , but no itemized account has ever been published , because they consisted of salaries paid to unnecessary employes who voted right and obeyed orders . I can not give you statistics about the class of people that chiefly buys tickets or who the prize winners are , but it is obvious that all money obtained from lottery prizes comes from the many and goes into the pockets of the few . Players never figure mathematically What the chances of winning are , but even if the lottery tickets were sold at par , or twenty dollars per ticket , the player pays too much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used to raise money , where the public is made to pay more for tickets than the official government price . As a vicious substitute for taxes , there is nothing to say in favor of the lottery . As a corrupting influence , it , has done much harm to our people . You could stop it. , if you really had Cuba 's interest at heart . " Still another Cuban cancer is the army . It has cost us about 814,000,000 a year in cash and a great deal more in bad government . In a military sense , Cuba is in an exceptionally fortunate position . Our only frontier is the deep blue sea . We have no neighbors to arm against and , therefore , no need of either a standing army or of compulsory military service . Our permanent treaty with the United States compels you to protect our territorial integrity . It is the least you can do when you deny us the right to declare war on any other nation . The Cuban army must , necessarily , always be a mercenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have suffered has been made possible by the existence of the unnecessary army . As an instrument of downright oppression , it was first used by Machado . Today , the present nonpolitical government has been kept in power by the army . It would fall if that support were withdrawn . Machado , compelled by his growing unpopularity to lean more and more upon an armed force , saw to it that the soldiers not only received good pay but received it punctually . Other government employes did not . Cuba 's army is merely a Prwtorian Guard . Many of us have felt that the fundamental error in the American mediation that ousted Machado was in not insisting then and there that the army be reduced to a safe figure . What the better element wishes is to have a smaller national constabulary or rural guard , for the enforcement of order in the interior . The money saved could be spent in useful public works . Without the army we might hope for a truly representative government , which we do not have today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many Cubans in Havana assert that they had no race problem , until I realized that they really meant there was no danger the colored vote would ever be strong enough to dominate the political situation . A country with more than one-half of the population Negro or negroid is bound to have a race problem . Our own Southern States do not fear Negro domination , but they have a serious-enough problem as it is . Precisely the same is true of Cuba , where , of late , there has been an obvious turn for the worse . Cuba 's Negro problem began in 1524 . It was continuously aggravated by the feet that the slaves were treated like worthless animals , and because the color line in sex relations was not drawn then , and is not now . Negro revolts are an old story in Cuba . The last serious uprising occurred in 1912 . A Negro senator , Martin Morua , who later became a member of Gomez 's cabinet , had the law passed that bears his name . It prohibited the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who felt that an exclusively Negro political party had absolutely no chance of success and that colored voters would be better off if they identified themselves with one or the other of the old parties . Since Machado 's fall , and especially after the recent overthrow of President Cespedes , the blacks grew bolder . Last November I saw bands of unemployed Negroes every day roaming the city of Havana . They slept in doorways . They moved into the empty houses of former - Machadists , knowing that the government would not dispossess them . The police told me that these Negroes begged and stole with a boldness they had never before displayed . While I was there , whenever there was a parade or a strike or any form of commotion in the street , I saw Negro bands following and shouting as though it were their show , ready to loot as they did during the memorable days in August when the Machadissts ' homes were plundered . In the news reels shown in the United States , this colored rabble was unfairly represented . as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The starvation wages and the increasing unemployment , made worse by the presence of thousands of Haitian and Jamaican Negroes imported by sugar companies to work in the mills and on the plantations  --  men of a less pacific temper than the native blacks  --  intensified the gravity of the situation . The colored population of Cuba hope for much from the Grau San Martin government , which is maintained in power by a mixed-color army against the wishes of a large majority of the Cuban people . During my stay in Havana , a detachment of soldiers marched past the American Club . A burly Negro , a corporal , seeing a group of Americans looking out from the balcony , yelled : " Get inside ! " and fired two shots at the white Americans who paid no attention to him , narrowly missing some of them . It may be he missed them intentionally . A law was decreed compelling all employers to have at least 50 per cent of their help Cuban . The Negroes insisted it meant that 50 per cent of all workers everywhere must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chaotic condition that prevailed in the country district in September and October improved somewhat in November , but the Grau government 's trend to the left makes white Cubans fear that conditions will grow steadily worse . A real Cuban-horn banker that I found in Havana has had the advantage of having spent years abroad . He told me : " I think I am able to take a detached view of conditions . I believe that the Negro problem here is serious . It is difficult For me to understand the willful blindness of so many of my white friends who deny that one exists . I tell them all the same thing : It is my firm conviction that the day is not far distant when there will be only two political parties in Cuba , the annexationists and the blacks . The present . government , which is really directed by two Communists , is maintained in power by an army that is not white , commanded by a chief of stall ' who is a mulatto . The chief of police is also a mulatto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power under the so-called authentic revolu-N m. aoneogrr Negroes ifs disorderly du Igeundehecemoknesdtrin all aLion . The soldiers see nothing and the Negroes are growing bolder and more exigent . It is bad enough to mix black and white , but red and black is a worse combination . " The average Cuban , undoubtedly having in mind the dictionary definition of the word , also denied that real Communism existed in Cuba , even though the government grew more anti-ea pietistic by the minute . It is probably true that most of the alleged Communists among the natives would not grasp Lenin 's ' doctrines . Even advanced - Socialism is difficult to teach to illiterate masses ; but at the rate the government is walking toward Moscow , the arrival may be nearer than Cubans think . For years the Communistic spirit has been developing in Cuba , just as it has in Mexico and Panama and Chile and other places ; for all that. , in Cuba the Communistic organization has not yet risen to the dignity of a recognized or powerful political party : Being essentially agriculturists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the contention that Cuba was immune to the Red plague . The transfer of the ownership of so much cultivated land to foreign corporations , followed by the unemployment due to the slump in the sugar market and the coalescing despair of the thousands who suffer hunger , has made it easy for professional propagandists to proselyte . Today the most influential officials no longer deny indignantly that they are Communistic . They feel that they can remain in power only by enlisting the aid of the discontented masses . The first so-called Communistic disorders arose from the general belief of the starvin gworkers that , once Machado was overthrown , living conditions would automatically and instantly improve . Instead , they grew worse , and the disappearance of the iron hand encouraged them to attempt . what they would not have dreamed of doing while Machado ruled . They became bolder with the rise to power of the present government , which declared itself to be free from all taint of Machadism , Yankee imperialism and other anti-labor " isms . " Bands of self-styled Communists , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid by Moscow , began to loot , unchecked . The plundering of the palaces of the Machado clique in Havana taught the masses what they might safely do when the police looked the other way . Hungry mobs would go into a plantation , devour everything there that was eatable and move on . They would take possession of a mill , eat up all the supplies at the stores and march on to the next , their numbers increased by the men who had worked at the last . place the mob looted . Foreign Agitators The agitators were foreigners ; Spanish , Russian and Polish , all of them old hands at it . They do not find it difficult to convince unemployed or underpaid workers that they are entitled to much more than they get . The Spanish agitators , speaking the language of the natives , have done the most effective work . Some of them have been at the game a long time , not only in Europe but in South America .

THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page 741 day compulsory and nationalized industry by making it obligatory to employ 50 per cent native Cubans . The incapacity of Cubans for self-government has long been recognized . This must necessarily be true in a country where the vast majority prefers to talk rather than act . This initiative-killing trait is the reason why owners and managers of industrial or commercial enterprises have found it advisable to hire foreigners for executive positions , not because they are foreigners but because they possess the executive and organizing ability lacking in so many Cubans . The " 50 per cent native Cuban " law was intended to remedy what the incompetents and the unemployed called an intolerable condition .

As this article is written , they seem to have gained more influence than ever . Guiteras , the Secretary of the interior and of War , and Batista , the head of the army , have more than once refused to obey the president . He ca n't oust the head of the army . Cubans have had very little experience with organized labor .
