Because of the apparent value of their maggots in medicine , Department of Agriculture entomologists last week zealously bred two of the more than 30,000 kinds of known flies. * The entomologists were laboring at the instance of Dr. William Stevenson Baer of Baltimore . Dr. Baer , is clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at Johns Hopkins and orthopedic surgeon of a half-dozen Baltimore hospitals . <P> When he was surgeon general of the orthopedic section of the American Expeditionary Forces ' medical service , he noted a strange coincidence . Many a shell-broken soldier lay unattended in the fields until his lacerations were alive with maggots . Every one should have died of blood poisoning . But , remarkably , many recovered quickly . <P> For a decade Dr. Baer pondered the coincidence . Medieval doctors , he knew , used to , apply maggots to festering sores , a gross , unlearned practice long abandoned . But maggots are scavengers of the offal they live in . Might it not be that the maggots in his War cases ate up the infected tissue debris , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which stimulated the growth of healthy tissue ? <P> Two years ago he decided to experiment on stubborn cases of osteomyelitis . Osteomyelitis is an infectious inflammation of the bone marrow or of the marrow and the bone . The bone rots , and then adjacent flesh . It is more common in children than in adults . It is difficult to cure . If unrestrained it may kill quickly or may last for years . The usual treatment is to cut out the decayed bone and flesh , often repeatedly . <P> He developed a method of sterilizing fly eggs in mercury bichloride solution and incubating them until they hatched into sterile maggots . The Department of Agriculture 's job is to develop a method of quantity production . The flies used are the bluebottle ( Calliphora erythrocephala ) and the greenbottle ( Lucilia caesar ) . <P> Warranting the labor is the fact that Dr. Baer has treated 300 cases of young and old osteomyelitis with his maggots . Every one of the children and four out of five of the adults were cured . <P> <P> *Insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . Entomologists discovered some 8,000 new kinds last year , have classified about 500,000 kinds , estimate that two to ten million kinds exist . True insects have three parts to their bodies-head , thorax , abdomen-and three pairs of legs and , usually , two pairs of wings attached to the thorax . Smallest insects are 1/100 in. long , scarcely discernible to the human eye . There is a chunky beetle ( Macrodontia cervicovnis ) 6 in. long , and some stick-insects reach 13-in. in length . Insect with the greatest wingspread is the moth Erebus agrippina , spread 11 in . But a fossil dragon fly had a 2-ft. spread .
