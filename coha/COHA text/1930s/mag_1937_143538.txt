For nearly two years a lithe , quick-moving , tousle-headed U. S. citizen has been nosing around Europe 's airways , his half-hostile eyes alert to see every new aviation development . Anxious to honor the world 's most famous flyer , foreign governments and companies withheld little from Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh , reserve Army flyer and unsalaried technical adviser of Pan American Airways . Returning fortnight ago " for Christmas , " Colonel Lindbergh landed with probably more complete information of Europe 's air plans , particularly those of Imperial Airways , than any individual on this side of the Atlantic . Last week , after three days of conferences with Colonel Lindbergh in Manhattan 's Chrysler Building , Pan American Airways quickly called for bids on plans made last April for up to twelve Yankee Clippers of breath-taking size- stipulated that preliminary general descriptions and sketches be submitted to Colonel Lindbergh by March 15 next year . <P> P. A. A. wants from the eight leading U. S. firms that build big airplanes a machine delivered within three years that will fly 5,000 mi. non-stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a payload of 25,000 Ib. in which is included full day and night accommodation for 100 passengers , crew of 16 , mail , baggage and express . Six months from now if Colonel Lindbergh and P. A. A. are still interested , $35,000 will be allotted to cover the cost to the builders of further estimates . As nothing a third the size has ever been constructed in the U. S. , airmen last week dazed themselves with such speculations of the completed ship as its wing spread , 200 ft. ; fuselage , 200 ft. by 25 ft. ; weight , 200,000 Ib. with six engines each 2,000 h.p . Only the memory of P. A. A. and Colonel Lindbergh 's plans for the first Clipper six years ago-then dubbed " impossible " and called the " flying miracle " - saved the idea from being utterly fantastic .
