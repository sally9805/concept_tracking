Women and children , 12.000 of them , stood in crowds all day long before Madrid 's railway station last week to be herded into trains and sent off to Valencia and safety . All night long picks and pneumatic drills echoed in the streets . Spain 's Radical Government was digging trenches , building pill boxes for the bloody last battle with the Whites which was coming as inevitably as Death . As soon as the street trenches were finished they were manned with taxi drivers , shop clerks , bricklayers , shoemakers , who were ordered to stay at their posts , eating and sleeping there until the attack on Madrid should come . A rigid 11 p. m. curfew was clamped on the capital . Every light went out . even privileged newshawks being forbidden in the streets . For a few paralyzing hours word flashed through the city that White bombers had broken the rail line to Valencia . that Madrid was completely cut off . German and Italian aviators , the only people on the Iberian Peninsula who seemed to know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Madrid-Valencia line in their strafing for Spain 's Whites , but 90 minutes later traffic was resumed . <P> In the mountain passes to the north of Madrid , where the improperly trained conscripts of White General Emilio Mola have been brawling with the even more improperly trained Government militia for three months , cold rains turned to sleet , then to snow , choked the mountain passes . <P> Sloe-eyed , soft-spoken Generalissimo Francisco Franco of the White Armies , realizing the difficulty of moving on Madrid through the Guadarrama Mountains of the North , transferred his headquarters within easier distance of the main line from Toledo to Madrid . Government troops , disorganized and poorly led , made brave counter-attacks that got nowhere , abandoned well-constructed trenches for villages impossible to hold , were shot down in their tracks while retreating , and occasionally deserted in groups .
