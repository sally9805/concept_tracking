One hundred of the 174 girls at smart Ethel Walker School in Simsbury , Conn , sat supping one night last week in the school 's big , square " Four Corners " dormitory . All at once there were uneasy stirrings . At a crisp command the girls arose , marched out on the lawn . While teachers called the roll they watched flames writhe and shoot through " Four Corners . " It soon burned to the ground and with it the belongings of 40 of the younger Walker girls-green wool and cotton uniforms , white crepe de chine evening dresses , riding habits . They had no place to sleep ; nor did 80 other girls . For two days prior " Beaverbrook , " a stately brick building that contained classrooms , offices , dining room , sleeping quarters , had been gutted by a brisk , suspiciously sudden fire . Most of Miss Walker 's girls had to be put up that night at an inn , a country club , in homes in Simsbury and Farmington . <P> Daughters of Jays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Walker 's strict , impersonal , well-regulated school . Day after the second fire , family automobiles rolled into Simsbury to fetch the girls home . But Dr. Earle Terry Smith , husband of Founder Ethel Walker . announced that he had obtained the use of the country club on Fisher 's Island off New London , that the school would carry on there until June . Meantime State police and constables guarded the school property . The fires ( loss $300,000 ) had both been started in windward corners of basements . Not only that : within the past few weeks five other fires had been discovered , snuffed out in time . Clearly it was arson , with suspicion pointing at a discharged school employe
