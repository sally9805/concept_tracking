A scientist who tricks Nature-for sound scientific reasons-is bushy-thatched Dr. Gregory Goodwin Pincus , formerly of Harvard , now of Clark University ( Worcester , Mass . ) Some years ago Dr. Pincus accomplished the first fertilization of mammalian ova in vitro-a polite way of saying that conception took place in a glass vessel . He took ova from a doe rabbit , sperm from a buck , mixed them in a culture flask , implanted the fertilized ova in another doe which , at term , produced a fine litter ( TIME , March 12 , 1934 ) . Since then the scientist has been able , by skillful coddling , to keep fertilized ova alive for ten days in vitro before implantation in the mother . <P> Last week Dr. Pincus exhibited a further marvel-a fatherless rabbit , born from an ovum which had never encountered the male fertilizing element at all . This process , called parthenogenesis , occurs naturally among certain insects , has been artificially induced by man in sea urchins and frogs , but never before in a mammal . Dr. Pincus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fertilize the ovum , and his canny microsurgical technique got the egg well started toward normal development in the host mother 's reproductive tract . <P> Normally the male spermatozoon is what determines the sex of the offspring . If the spermatozoon has a male-determining chromosome pattern in its nucleus , the sex will be male ; if not , female . Since there was no spermatozoon in the case of the fatherless rabbit , therefore no male-determining pattern , the Pincus rabbit is a female . She seems to be perfectly normal . Mated to an ordinary buck , she produced a normal litter . These bunnies are the first in rabbit history with no maternal grandfather . <P> Naturally a swarm of newshawks , callous to the delicate distinctions of science , bore down on Dr. Pincus to find out how soon mammalian parthenogenesis could be applied to humans . The scientist dodged these embarrassing queries . A spokesman for him huffed : " Dr. Pincus ' work will make possible certain manipulations and experiments which will aid in the study of cellular and biological growth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with human beings . This work will in no way affect the manner of living or customs .
