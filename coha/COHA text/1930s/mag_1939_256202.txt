Most audacious of astronomical showmen is James Stokley , director since 1933 of Philadelphia 's Fels Planetarium . Big , stooped Mr. Stokley ( rhymes with Annie Oakley ) this week arrives in Pittsburgh to become director of the Buhl Institute of Popular Science and Buhl Planetarium ( to open this fall ) . <P> A planetarium picture of stars in the night sky is breathtakingly spectacular at first sight , monotonous after repetition . Stokley , the greatest showman in planetariana , provides variety to keep planetari-addicts coming in . Three years ago he depicted the " End of the World " -a huge moon drawing close to Earth after millions of years , eventually breaking up and showering Earth with its fragments . Stuffy astronomers were shocked by this fiction but Stokley defended it as a product of imagination " guided by a knowledge of exact facts . " This month Fels visitors were treated to an imaginary trip to the present harmless moon-takeoff in a rocket ship , sound effects , landing in a lunar crater-were even given " tickets " for the voyage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a conjunction of three planets occurred which may have been the guiding star of the Three Wise Men , was no Stokley invention . It was originated as a Christmas program by Director Philip Fox of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago , but Stokley improved on it , added music , a crche , soft lights , a cardboard tableau of the wise men . <P> Born 39 years ago , the son of a Philadelphia umbrella maker , James Stokley is a jack of all sciences ; puttered with chemistry and photography in boyhood , studied biology at the University of Pennsylvania , took an M.A. in psychology , taught general science in high school , wrote science articles for newspapers . In 1924 he met the late Dr. Edwin Emery Slosson , famed chemistry popularizer , who hired him as a staff writer for Science Service . As a Science Service writer Stokley hopped over to Germany to get his first look at a planetarium . He was thrilled . Since then he has directed two solar eclipse expeditions and two years ago , on a freighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witnessed the longest total eclipse of the sun ( 7 min. 6 sec. ) seen by man in more than 1,200 years . <P> When Soapmaker Samuel Simeon Fels financed a planetarium for Philadelphia , Stokley was the man to run it . <P> Mathematician Albert Einstein , Musician Jos1 Iturbi and erudite Baseballer Moe Berg ( Phi Beta Kappa ) saw their first planetarium shows to the accompaniment of Stokley 's deep , well-modulated lectures . Baseballer Berg became a frequent visitor , once herded all his Boston Red Sox teammates . into the Philadelphia tabernacle of the stars . <P> There are four planetariums already operating in the U. S.-the Adler in Chicago , the Pels in Philadelphia , the Hayden in Manhattan , the Griffith in Los Angeles . All were financed in whole or part by philanthropists . So also is the new Buhl in Pittsburgh , financed out of a $13,000,000 legacy left to the Buhl Foundation by Henry Buhl Jr. , founder of Pittsburgh 's Boggs and Buhl department store , who died in 1927.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
