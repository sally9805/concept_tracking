Last week was a busy one for Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt . For seven years the First Lady has left citizens bemused by her energy , her speeches , her candor , her clubs , her charities , her children , the range of her interests , the breadth of her sympathy , and the way she got around . She has been less like the traditional First Lady than like the busy mistress of some great estate , with the whole U. S. as the household . Upstairs , downstairs , morning to night , seven days a week , with never a cross word , she has noted spots of dust on the chandelier , the need for paint on the outlying houses , that dust accumulating in Oklahoma , those new curtains for San Francisco . <P> The U. S. , at first astonished , then annoyed , then amused at her flying trips to coal mines and reclamation projects , has gradually settled back like some impressed but comfort-loving onlooker , to wonder how she found time to do it all . <P> Busy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> To Washington Junior Leaguers she suggested that women who work and do not need their pay should use their money to increase jobs . <P> To 500 women attending the Household Employment Symposium at Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hotel , she urged that domestic work be put on a professional basis . Most fluttered guest at the lunch was one Mildred Stewart , a maid , who sat between Mrs. Roosevelt and feminist Author Fannie Hurst . Mrs. Roosevelt listened to Miss Stewart 's speech : " As trained workers we do n't feel we have anything to gain from a union ... we have discussed the advantages of social security but we have n't fallen for the arguments of either C. I. O. or A. F. of L. organizers . " <P> Guest of honor at a dinner at the Astor Hotel given by The Churchman , Protestant <P> Episcopal magazine , which gave her its annual award for " Promotion of Good Will and Understanding Among All Peoples , " she heard herself praised for her " genius of goodness , " heard even more hearty praise from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried , to see what was happening to youth and the Dies Committee . Trouble began long ago . If the whole U. S. is considered the great house of democracy , then Martin Dies has been like a newcomer who believes he has uncovered a terrific scandal in the family . Said he rudely : Why , the place is full of Communists . Liberals hush-hushed , feared a Red-hunt , kept saying Martin Dies had made a mistake-he should be after Fascists , not Communists . But when the Dies Committee began to talk about U. S. youth , found youth organizations mixed up with evil companions , hinted that youth had been out all night with the Reds , could no longer tell right from Red , Mrs. Roosevelt rushed to youth 's defense like an outraged mother hen defending her chick 's good name . <P> Summons . It was five o'clock in the afternoon , and Mrs. Roosevelt was having tea in Manhattan with Frances Williams , 25 , administrative secretary of the American Youth Congress , when a telegram arrived . It called for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to testify before the Dies Committee , to appear at ten the next morning . American Youth Congress has had Mrs. Roosevelt 's support from the start , and she has denied that its leaders are Communists. * <P> But this looked like the biggest attack so far .
