txt The necessity of adding 1,132 patrolmen to the Police Department personnel to provide adequately for public safety was stressed yesterday by Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine at a hearing before Leo J. , Budget Director . Such an addition to the force is essential , the commissioner asserted , to provide for the safety of the public , especially in the parks . In Central Park , he declared , conditions are so bad that " even strong men " are not safe there at night . His plea for additional park policing was strongly supported by Mrs. Arthur Hays Sulzberger , president of the Park Association ; Allyn R. Jennings , general superintendent of the Park Department , and by representatives of several other civic and governmental agencies . The Police Commissioner 's warning of the unsafe conditions in Central Park came after Mr. Jennings had described park vandalism , which , he said , causes upward of $500,000 a year damage . " There are some things infinitely more important than vandalism , " said Mr. Valentine . " It is almost impossible adequately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are so many places of concealment . " It is unsafe , sometimes even in daytime , for a woman . Nor are men , not even strong men , safe in Central Park . Similar conditions obtain in Morningside , Mount Morris and Riverside Parks . These are our great care . Our constant worry is that we will have a homicide in these parks , and we have had them . " Mrs. Sulzberger urged additional police in the parks to safeguard women and children . The Police Commissioner , echoing this view , added : " The possibility of an atrocious crime in the parks is always present . When a little girl is missing from her home for even a Short time the first thought that occurs to her mother is that her child has been horribly mutilated . " Mr. Jennings pointed out that vandalism rarely occurred in sections of parks where policemen are stationed on fixed posts . As an example of the vandalism , which aggregates $500,000 a year , he cited thefts of doorknobs from Central Park and of copper sprinkler heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkler-head stealing was so persistent , he added , that finally the Park Department had to rip up the watering system . Shrubs and Trees Ruined " We have to repair 6,000 benches a year , " the park superintendent told the budget director . " Damage to shrubs , flowers and trees is enormous . Heads and arms have been taken from pieces of statuary in the Rice Playfield , and bayonets have been stolen several times from the Seventh Regiment memorial on Fifth Avenue . " Every year , he added , about 250 acres of lawn have to be reseeded as the result of vandalism , an operation which costs the city some $200,000 a year . " Everybody realizes that more police would cut the loss to the city , " interjected Mr. . To this Mr. Jennings assented . He added that it should be remembered that recreational facilities in the city have been tripled in the last two and a half years . In spite of this , he pointed out , the Park Department is asking for only about twice the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentine asks $58 , - 132,439 for the coming year , against a 1936 allotment of $54,527,803 . Of the increase , $2,595,309 is sought for personal service , or salaries . Of the personal service increase , by far the larger part is asked to permit the naming of the 1,132 additional patrolmen at $2,000 a year salaries . Such an addition to the force would cost $2,697,656 , but since 562 will be replacements the net increase would be $454,290 less . It was pointed out by the commissioner that the full quota of patrolmen authorized by the Board of Estimate is 17,253 and that even with the addition of the patrolmen sought the uniformed force would still be 1,295 below authorized strength Valentine Asks 105 Captains Mr. Valentine asked that he be allowed the full quota of 105 police captains and urged too that funds be provided to staff lower grades fully . " I want to see all vacancies filled from deputy chief inspector right down to patrolman , " he said . " It is impossible to police the city with an inadequate number of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago are now thriving communities which need policing . Each has its main street . its markets and its shopping center . " In addition , there are a couple of hundred playgrounds which have been opened . These include parks and parkways , bathing pools and recreational facilities . " Mr. asked if there was any basis for statements made by budget critics that the police could operate on the 1918 appropriation . " We just could not run the department , " replied the commissioner . " You ca n't go back five years , let alone eighteen years , not in this city . In 1918 there were 150,000 registered cars in the city ; today there are almost 1,000,000 , not including the cars of visitors and transients . " In 1918 the Police Department had 180 pieces of motorized apparatus ; today there are more than 1,100 , and that is not enough . You ca n't police this city of 7,000,000 people today without automobiles and radio cars . If you did n't have radio cars you would have a new police commissioner every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Valentine explained . The two heavyweight prizefights recently held at the Yankee Stadium , he said , called for assignment of 585 men to the stadium and 250 more as a reserve held for emergencies in the Bronx County Courthouse . " Of course , there was no need for the reserves because a holiday and carnival spirit prevailed in Harlem after the last fight , " he said , " but you can never tell when there 'll be trouble if the decision is the other way . " The budget director also beard the application of the city 's Law Department for $1,808,661 for 1937 , against a 1936 allowance of $1,687 , - 981 . Most of the increase sought was for salary increases , all of them for lower-paid members of the office staff .
