txt Will . Ragers Again at Sea And Apparently Not Happy To the Editor of The New York Times : SS . ILE DE FRANCE , Jan. 31 . ? I was sentenced to the disagreement conference for duration of its existence , but I got time off for good behavior and am now out here on the ocean on the great French boat . Not only ca n't speak French but ca n't even pronounce the name of the boat . Going to be a lot of guessing games on when I feel well enough to go into ? the dining room ( which has n't been yet ) . Me and this Ocean just doret , got along . That 's all there is to it Next year 's disarmament conference got to be held in Claremore . Our team at the conference looked awful good . They had teen holding skull practice among themselves every day , They are working up a lot of defensive plays among them to offset the trick plays of some of those other teams . Stimson is about the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knute Rockne to go . Good night . I got to lay down . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
