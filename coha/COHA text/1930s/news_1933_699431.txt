txt Indications that President Hoover was seriously considering another message to Congress , based on the failure of the Democrats to sponsor legislation toward a balanced budget , and perhaps censuring the Democrats for their failure to accomplish tangible results in the short session , increased late today after President Hoover conferred with Secretary Mills and J. Clawson Roop , Director of the Budget . No.admission that such a message was forthcoming would be made by Mr. Mills when he emerged from the conference , but he said yester- I day that a message would do much to clarify the tangled fiscal situation . Asked if the message would be sent early next week , Mr. Mills replied that he did not want to say what the President planned or to give a " bum steer " to his questioners . He said that fiscal affairs , " as of today , " had been discussed in view of the reductions made in the few appropriation bills already passed by the House , but which have yet to be acted upon in thee , Senate . Hoover Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappointment of the rejection of his consolidation plans for various bureaus and agencies , in order to effect an unestimated saving during the present fiscal year , and more keenly the failure of Congress to take definite steps toward overcoming an estimated deficit of $490,000,000 apart from debt charges . He is said to feel that failure of legislation to balance the budget and overcome the expected deficit will seriously affect the credit of the government . During the week he has confererd many times with Mr. Mills and Mr. Roop , and other Cabinet officers have presented him with additional fiscal data to which he has devoted considerable attention . Another factor which was said to influence an early message is that President-elect Roosevelt is expected here late next week for a series of conferences with Democratic leaders . Should President Hoover early in the week take Congress to task with a. frank revelation of fiscal affairs as they exist at this time , his supporters argue that it will have the effect of forcing the President-elect and Democratic leaders to a more strenuous effort toward increased revenues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit such a message at an early date , and the Republicans believe that he will be justified in blaming the Democratic leadership for failure to put for- ward a definite plan for balancing the budget , inasmuch as the President 's appeals have been ignored . But they also remark that a nonpartisan statement of the actual condition of the Treasury and the future outlook would have equal effect and at the same time avoid partisan ill-feeling . Two Proposals Are Advanced . Two proposals for balancing the Federal budget for the next fiscal year , one in Congress and the other from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States , were advanced during the day . More than $1,000,000 would be arbitrarily cut from the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 under a resolution introduced in the Senate by Senator Tydings , Democrat of Maryland . The Committee on Federal Expenditures of the Chamber of Commerce , in a report by Matthew S. Sloan , chairman , recommended reducing governmental costs by $800,000,000 or more , largely by eliminating many payments to veterans and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping for 1933-34 routine appropriations of $534 , - 000,000 for payment on the principal of the national debt ; the remainder of the saving would come out of general appropriations at the discretion of the Senate Appropriations Committee . Although Mr. Tydings introduced the resolution without comment , it is understood to have the backing of a considerable group of Senators . Speaking on the floor , Senator Lewis of Illinois especially commended it , recommending that the Interstate Commerce Commission be abolished and its functions transferred directly to the Federal courts . Senator Long of Louisiana commended the movement as a departure from what he termed the current practice of Congress in " pecking at the edges " of Federal expenditures . Commerce Chamber 's Proposal . The Federal expenditures committee of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States came forward with suggestions for economies which , the committee held , were substantially greater than are contemplated in the " lame-duck " session . In a statement for the committee to the chamber 's board of directors , Mr. Sloan , as its chairman , put the possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of this magnitude , Mr. Sloan contended , would obviate the necessity of adding new taxes to balance the Federal budget in the fiscal year 1934 . The largest single saving recommended by the committee was $400,000,000 in veterans ' benefits . This could be done , the report said , without denying generous compensation to men who suffered disabilities resulting from the war or to dependents of those who were killed . The whole amount would be afforded by cutting off grants for non-service connected cases . The committee called attention to the fact that the budget message recommended a cut of only about $87,000,000 in this field . As the next largest economy , the committee urged the elimination of $250,000,000 for construction and public works , as recommended in the budget . The report re-emphasized the contention of the administration that the public works program was speeded up to an abnormal pace as a relief measure , and that the question should not be viewed from any longer range than obtained when the speeding-up process was started . For the remainder of the proposed saving the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Federal expenditures by virtue of the national emergency and further curtail expenditures in the several departments . The program would allow an increase of $66,000,000 in public debt charges and still produce a net saving of $804,000,000 . Mr. Sloan , in making his report , stressed the proposed additional cut in veterans ' benefits . He asserted that the reduction as proposed by his committee in this one item alone , plus the general economies recommended by President Hoover , would balance the budget . " Cutting of expenditures is a difficult and painful task , " Mr. Sloan said . " The Federal budget must , however , be reduced to a level in keeping with the reduced national income and that of individuals and corporations . " The public is demanding reductions . The President has recommended substantial cuts . Congress is indicating that it is economyminded . The present offers an unusually favorable opportunity to secure the necessary economies . The process should be completed now and the budget balanced by reducing expenditures. "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
