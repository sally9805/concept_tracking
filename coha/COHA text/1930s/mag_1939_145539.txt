The American Way ( by George S. Kaufman &; Moss Hart ) . After getting almost as much ballyhoo as a World 's Fair , Kaufman &; Hart 's monster " spectacle " opened last week with a cast of 250 . Against the animated background of an Ohio town , it tells the life-story of Martin and Irma Gunther ( Fredric March and Florence Eldridge ) from their arrival as immigrants , through joys and sorrows , poverty and wealth , until Martin is killed by a Nazi Bund while trying to prevent his grandson from joining it . <P> The story of the Gunthers is wholly symbolic . Real hero of the play is the American outlook , its love of enterprise and liberty . This is an inspiring theme . But working crudely , emotionally , in headlines , Kaufman &; Hart over-sentimentalize their theme . Canny showmen , they know that if , as Dr. Johnson said , patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel , it is also one of the first salvations of a box office ; that mother love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great art but also the surefire cliches of popular entertainment ; that a cavalcade of the past-Bryan and T. R. , the Wright Brothers and Lindbergh , hobble skirts and high-buttoned shoes-is a perfect ace-in-the-hole . <P> The American Way has nostalgic , exciting , touching moments . But in its sheer emotionalism , it parallels a cinema spectacle , vintage 1924.
