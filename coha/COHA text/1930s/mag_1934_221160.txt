Before the Revolution of 1917 Russia knew its Sergei Vassilievitch Rachmaninoff chiefly as a composer who patterned himself after Tchaikovsky and wrote gentle , nostalgic music according to 19th Century traditions . The U. S. knows Rachmaninoff best as a pianist , a career forced on him by exile and the loss of his fortune . But in his quiet unpublicized way Rachmaninoff has gone on writing music . In Baltimore last week a Rapsodie which he composed last summer was given its premire by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra .
