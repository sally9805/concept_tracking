The following note was received from the Italian Amabassador , Augusto Rosso , by Secretary Hull : Sir : With reference to your note of May 28 , containing a statement of the amounts due from Italy under the provisions of the debt agreement of Nov. 14 , 1925 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my government has instructed me to address to you the following communication : " By the token payments made on the 15th of June and on the 15th of December , 1933 , the Italian Government has shown its good will and at the same time the limitations imposed upon it by the actual situation . " This situation , both in the economic and financial , fields , not only has not improved since then , but has become even worse . In fact , while tariff barriers and other hindrances to the exchange of goods , which is the chief source of international transfers , have further increased , there is practically no hope that Italy may be able again to collect those payments from German reparations which in 1925 have been taken as a basis for determining Italy 's ability to put aside and transfer the amounts indicated by the debt agreement of Nov. 14 , 1925 . " The Italian Government , which has always been and is still willing to acknowledge its obligation in view of a final settlement , would have been prepared to reaffirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been informed , however , that , under a law recently enacted , the nations which do not make full payment of the amounts due on the 15th of June will be considered as being in default . " In these circumstances and since , for the reasons mentioned above , the payment and transfer of the full amount due on the said date can not be effected , the Italian Government regrets to have to abandon the intention of making a token payment . " Th4 Italian Government feels confident that , when the question might be re-examined by the two governments , the very foundations of the settlement of November , 1925 , will , in the light of the new situation which has developed since then , help to bring about a satisfactory solution .
