Ninotchka ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) reveals the moral , political and sartorial bankruptcy that ensues when a female Bolshevik is exposed to the bourgeois perils of running water , Melvyn Douglas and Paris . Unlike most pictures about Russian Reds , this one is neither crude clowning nor crude prejudice , but a literate and knowingly directed satire which lands many a shrewd crack about phony Five Year Plans , collective farms , Communist jargon and pseudo-scientific gab where it will do the most good-on the funny bone . <P> During one of those shortages of cash that seem to be chronic in the planned economy , Moscow sends Comrades Bul-janoff , Iranoff and Kopalski to Paris to sell confiscated jewels . Though at first they ask , " What would Comrade Lenin say ? " about stopping at a swank hotel , the answer soon comes clear : " Comrade Lenin would say , ' The prestige of the workers must be upheld . ' We can not go against Comrade Lenin . " But they hastily order " the smallest , dirtiest room in the hotel " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She is an unsmiling young Russian , with a delightful Swedish accent , who announces that love is a chemical reaction , wants to know at once how much steel the Eiffel Tower contains . At Count Leon 's ( Melvyn Douglas ) smart bachelor apartment , Ninotchka shocks his staid old butler by asking , " Does he beat you ? " and by urging that all wealth be shared equally . As the butler indignantly refuses to share his lifetime savings with his bankrupt employer , she says : " Run along to bed , little father . " When the Count makes love to her while a traffic cop is tooting his whistle , grimly scientific Ninotchka asks : " What is the interval between his whistles ? " Her disintegration begins when she discards her semimilitary outfit , buys the most becoming hat she can find , which looks like a horse 's nose bag inverted . <P> Though the comedy becomes somewhat chilled when the comrades return to Moscow , there are such inspirations as a parade on the Red Square with marchers stolidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes in Ninotchka 's small apartment whose limited lebensraum she shares with a girl cellist , a beefy Russian streetcar conductress of the kind Poet e. e. cummings called " non-men , " and a dark , dumpy little man who plods silently in &; out- " You never know whether he is going to the washroom or the secret police . " <P> Garbo , who plays her first full-length comedy with iron , Bolshevik disregard for glamor , in a khaki uniform and middie blouse , succeeds in the difficult task of making her tight-lipped fanaticism funny without making it ridiculous . Even her change of heart is winning and plausible . But why she should change under the impact of Melvyn Douglas is one of those things even the genius of Karl Marx could not explain . <P> Good gag : When Ninotchka asks , " Are n't you in love with our Five Year Plan ? " , cracks Melvyn Douglas : " I 've been in love with that Five Year Plan for the last 15 years . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
