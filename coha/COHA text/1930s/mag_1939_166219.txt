Since Hitler began persecuting Jews and Japanese began killing Chinese , millions of peaceful people have been fighting the losers ' battles with boycotts . Fortnight ago U. S. Department of Commerce breakdowns of 1938 foreign trade figures measured the boycotts ' success . Last week , to stimulate revival of trade , Germany set up a German-American Chamber of Commerce of the Pacific Coast in San Francisco ; and in Chicago the German Consul General for the Midwest revealed he was trying to barter German machinery , harmonicas , barbed wire for several hundred thousand tons of U. S. lard . <P> The Department of Commerce figures showed that U. S. imports from Germany had dropped from $78,100,000 in 1933 ( Hitler 's Year One ) to $64,500,000 last year , a fall of 17% . During the same period imports from Belgium rose 44% , from Norway 16% , from the United Kingdom 6% . Last year ( first full year of the war in China ) U. S. imports from Japan fell from 1937 's $204,200,000 to $126,800,000 . <P> Granting the general decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange restrictions , boycotters nevertheless claim much credit for these whopping trade losses . That credit must be divided between 1 ) the uncoordinated efforts of millions of individual shoppers , and 2 ) the organized activity that stems chiefly from two groups : the Joint Boycott Council ( of the American Jewish Congress and Jewish Labor Committee ) and the American Boycott Against Aggressor Nations ( onetime Committee for a Boycott Against Japanese Aggression ) . <P> By &; large , boycotting has been ineffective against producer goods such as German chemicals , iron pipes , tools , wire , certain kinds of industrial machines . Results show most clearly in consumer goods like gloves , furs , toys . In Manhattan , with the biggest Jewish concentration in the U. S. , Macy , Saks-Fifth Avenue , Gimbel Bros. , Lord &; Taylor , Franklin Simon , Bloomingdale , B. Altman and many other stores have stopped carrying German-made merchandise . <P> To boycotters such facts are reason for gloating . Not to be overlooked , however , is the fact that foreign trade is a give- &-take; affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new German-American Chamber of Commerce of the Pacific Coast pointed out that German purchases of U. S. dried prunes and apricots had dwindled from 33% of the total exported in 1929 to 8.8% in 1937 . And the lard dickerings demonstrated how U. S. farmers are suffering from the drop in German trade . In pre-Hitler years Germany often bought as much as 30% , of U. S. lard exports ; last year Germany bought only 7%-and last week U. S. loose lard was at the lowest price in over four years ( 5 a lb . ) . <P> Although Germany now needs lard desperately and the U. S. has a glut , it was by no means likely that a deal could be arranged . Last week several packers announced that they would sell their lard for cash only .
