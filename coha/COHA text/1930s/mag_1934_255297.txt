Lost Horizons ( by Harry Segall and John Hayden ; Laurence Rivers , Inc. , producers ) . What a hotel was to Grand Hotel , what a dinner was to Dinner at Eight , Heroine Janet Evans ( Jane Wyatt ) is to Lost Horizons . In this play the dramatic assembly of heterogeneous people and events begins after she commits suicide because her lover deserts her . In the next scene Janet Evans arrives in a lobby next to Heaven and begins to read the histories of the lives which would have been bound up with hers if she had stayed on earth : a disheartened Kansas City playwright ; a female derelict whose seducer has abandoned her in Montreal ; a cardsharp and the banker 's daughter he is scheming to marry ; a young socialite condemned for murder ; a Manhattan play-boy and his mistress . Only in Act II , when she comes to read the projection of her own life as she should have lived it . does her role in their miscellaneous affairs become apparent . <P> She would have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party after the opening night in Atlantic City , the brother of the Montreal derelict would have recognized in the cardsharp the villain responsible for his sister 's disappearance . The playboy would have fallen in love with Janet Evans and this , by a roundabout chain of circumstances , would have saved the life of the convicted murderer . So carried away is Janet Evans by these glimpses into her discarded future that she is horrified when the Kansas City playwright , who would have been her husband , walks into Heaven 's reading room and fails to recognize her . <P> The patness of Lost Horizons ' plot is impaired by the complicated temporal sequence of its 20 scenes , the over-intricate arrangement of the characters . But if Lost Horizons is not likely to be a satisfactory successor to The Green Pastures in Laurence Rivers ' ( Rowland Stebbins ) series of supernatural moralities , it will not be any fault of its leading lady . Jane Wyatt contrives to spill none of its spiritual qualities while adding considerably to its physical appeal . <P> If she succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of the hollow tradition that cheap theatrical boarding houses , one-night stands , hardships in stock companies and the pangs of poverty are indispensable incubators of talent . She was born 21 years ago near smart Tuxedo . N. Y. Her upbringing in horsy Dutchess County was well calculated to make her think of the theatre as a place into which nice people do not venture until the middle of the first act . Her first experience in drama was playing Shylock at fashionable Miss Chapin 's School in Manhattan . <P> After a decorous debut party in 1929 and two years at Barnard , Jane Wyatt did her best to conform to the routine for stage beginners by making the round of theatrical offices . The round lasted only until she reached the office of Charles Hopkins who promptly engaged her for an ingenue role in Give Me Yesterday . One season in stock , at the commodious summer theatre in Stockbridge , Mass. , a few more appearances in Manhattan , prepared her for Hollywood . In her first picture ( One More River ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her second , Great Expectations ( see p. 58 ) . <P> She prefers cinema to the stage , belongs to Colonial Dames of America , likes riding and roller-skating in Central Park , never misses Sunday mass.
