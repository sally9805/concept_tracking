txt Twenty thousand workmen celebrated Groundhog Day yesterday by hacking at New York 's glacial covering , with no prospect of a break in the weather to help them . The day 's average was 18 degrees above zero with low mark of 10 degrees at 4 A. M. and high mark of 25 degrees at 4 P. M. Normal for Candlemas Day is 30 degrees . ' The Weather Bureau predicted slightly warmer weather for today . Snow was headed in the general direction of the city out of the Tennessee Valley , but whether it would come all the way was doubtful . The rivers were heavy with floating ice . One great floe smashed the tug President below the water line at the foot of Jay Street and let the water in . The President was deserted by her crew of six , on orders , but was hauled up by a sister tug , the Timothy J. Sullivan , after she had settled four feet into the water . Groundhog Routed Out . The city , more or less eXcustomed to the cold after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Groundhog Day if the radio had not jammed the tradition into its ears . It was done by continuity writers , cooperating with officials of the Bronx Zoo . They got no cooperation from the groundhog , thcigh . He was embittered and sullen about the whole business . In the first place , he was hauled out of his warm cage in the small mammal house at 2:40 P. M. because that was the time set in the National Broadcasting Company schedule for his appearance . Keeper Herbert Kafka carried him out into the open air and into a small cleared space in the snow , where reporters , camera men and radio announcers had assembled . A radio timer stood by with a stop watch . At 2:40 he waved to John B. Kennedy , radio announcer . Mr. Kennedy stepped to the microphone . " Good afternoon , all , " he chirruped , ' with the traditional good cheer of radio announcers . Animal Distinctly Disapproves . The martyr woodchuck ground its ' teeth , threw him a nasty look and shuddered . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the script ) , " where 's this groundhog we 've come to interview ? " Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars , curator at Bronx Zoo , read from script , too . " Right here , in his Winter home , Mr. Kennedy . He 'll come out in a minute . " " How on earth can he breathe in that deep burrow ? " What burrow ? The sad little woodchuck threw a piteous glance at Kafka . In former years some pretense at reality was made , by actually stuffing the woodchuck down a hole . But not yesterday . " That 's just how he does breathe , " said Dr. Ditmars ( from the script ) . " The ' ground contaIns enough oxygen for his requirements through the winter . " The woodchuck looked wistfully at the warm interior of the small mammal house , closed his eyes miserably , and shivered . Probably Was a Shadow . There was a lot more of the dialogue , the sum of which was that groundhogs are really no good as weather forecasters . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shadow and was ducking back in the hole . He was in Kafka 's arms all the while . Mr. Kennedy ? " Is it going to be a long Winter and a cold Spring ? " The script called for " sound from groundhog . " They got it . Kafka pinched the woodchuck . That was followed by more cute dialogue . And every time the script called for a squeak the woodchuck was pinched again . In four minutes , though , it was all over . The woodchuck got a piece of banana for posing for the photographers and was put back in his cage . Avery Plotz , who pretends to know animal speech , insisted last night that he heard one of the other woodchucks ask the martyr ' chuck how the weather stunt had come off ; whether Spring was just around the corner . " I think so , " yawned the martyr ' chuck . " The radio announcer saw his shadow , but he did n't cluck into his burrow . " Then he rolled up and fell asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the official groundhog for that Arkansas city died of the heat . Because the other animals were shivering with cold the keepers put on more heat . It was too much for the groundhog.
