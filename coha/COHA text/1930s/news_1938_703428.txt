txt With the statement that " there can be no compromise . with a p cancer , " Homer Martin , resident of the United Automobile Workers Union , second largest C. 1 . 0 . affiliate , declared today that his organization was determined to wage a finish fight on Communists and all " disruptive elements " who seek to utilize their membership for political and . other extraneous purposes . Mr. Martin spoke at the concluding session of the Tamiment Economic and Social Institute , devoted to discussion of problems of labor and recovery . At the same time he held out an olive branch to the American Federation of Labor , saying his union would not fight any efforts on the part of A. F. of L. unions to 9rganize the unorganized , and ? predicting that peace would eventually come between the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . as a result of the good will that has been developing among the rank and file of both camps . He refrained , however , from discussing any immediate official moves for peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States Department of Labor , - ap- ' pealed ' for peace between the American Federation of Labor and the C. 0 . as essential to the interests of both labor and industry , as well as to the public interest . " Forces Beyond Control " " The A. F. of L.-C . I. 0 . fight is fundamental and personal , " Mr. Steelman said . " Due to forces ' which no individual can now control , it will be some time before the split is entirely healed . Meantime , extreme bitterness is . generally waning . There are , of course , exceptions  --  harmful exceptions where extreme individuals do injury and embarrass not only their own union but the labor movement in general . It would be to the advantage of labor as a whole , as well as to industry and the public , if the feud were brought to the speediest possible conclusion . " Referring to the recent expulsion of five officials - of the United Automobile Workers and their im- ' pending trial on charges of disruptive activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize control of the uniorr , Mr. Martin assailed the Communists and their allies as enemies of tire organization . He scored particularly those whom he held responsible for provoking unauthorized strikes . The union can not survive unless ' such strikes cease , he warned . " We have affidavit proof that certain - international officers and representatives ordered certain . units of our union to strike . in violation of their agreements , " Mr. Martin said . " There is no place in the ' labor movement for men who will not live up to their agreements , for those who make laws and then refuse to abide by them . The labor move- merit can not survive unless , by its own discipline and laws , it can establish for itself a position of responsibility in the community and to employers . " Those who violate the laws of the union with impunity and contracts made in a democratic way with employers are enemies of organized labor and not its friends . There is no place in the union for those who place the welfare of alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the elements he assailed controlled only twelve of the 500 locals of the United Automobile Workers and that he and the officers supporting him have already received pledges from 200 of the locals declaring that " there can be no peace with a cancer . " " They have pledged every dime and every dollar they have to the building of a labor union that will be free and have the respect of the community , " Mr. Martin said . " Our fight to build such a labor union , not a political union , has just begun so far as we are concerned . " While defending the sit-down strikes that marked the early history of the United Mine Workers as legitimate measures of defense against what he characterized as a concerted effort of the employers at that time to prevent ' organization and collective bargaining by resorting to violence and other , illegal methods , Mr. Martin indicated that there would be no more sitdown strikes if the workers are not frustrated in their demands for collective bargaining . " Neither sit-down strikes nor any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of collective bargaining and the practices of ' democracy , " Mr. Martin declared . Predicts Ford . Organization The automobile union chieftain made a plea for extension of labor organization and collective bargaining as factors for recovery , and predicted that Henry Ford 's plants would be organized before long . " My guess as , to whether . Henry Ford will recognize the union ? - is that he will , because the workers of this country have become convinced that collective ' bargaining is not only a right but a necessity , " Mr. Martin said : " No permanent recovery is possible until labor has a sufficient share with . which to buy back what it produces . And this can be obtained only by collective bargaining . " Mr. Martin 's remarks on the prospects of peace between the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . came in response to a question from the audience when he declared that " our union is not going to fight the organization of workers but will cooperate with unions in the A. F. of L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit and other cities outside the automobile industry and have turned them all over to the appro7 priate A. F. of L. unions , " he said . " Peace between the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0 . will come eventually as the spirit of cooperation and good-will develops among the unions themselves . This is the surest way to peace . " Mr. Steelman expressed opposition to proposals for incorporation of labor unions and compulsory arbitration . Incorporation of labor unions , he said , was " a lot of nonsense . " " It will not solve any problems , " he added , " for labor is already , responsible under the law . Incorporation of labor unions , sending agitators to Alaska , as suggested by Mayor Hague , and any other methods implying the use of force , such as compulsory arbitration , will never settle industrial disputes . It is the habit of consultation that needs to be vigorously fostered , for ultimately genuine industrial peace in a democracy is not created by the setting up of machinery , but is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Ultimately , what brings genuine industrial peace is not the letter of the law but the attitude of mind of workers and employers toward each other , and their will and ability to understand one another . " Mr. Steelman pointed out that , contrary to other and older industrial countries , collective bargaining in the United States is now only in the early stages of its development on a wide national scale , and predicted that ? with the extension of its acceptance and application the number of industrial conflicts ? here would diminish , as it has elsewhere . He cited England and Sweden as examples . 5,006 Strikes Are Cited " We are just now coming to recognize collective bargaining , " he said . " In other countries , where I the second or third generation are working under the system of collective agreements , strikes and lockouts are almost negligible as compared to this country where , last . year , we had almost 5,000 strikes and lost over 28,000,000 man- ' days . " Mr. Steelman spoke of the effective , work being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , saying that during the past eleven months it has handled over 2,000 labor disputes , involving more than 1,200 , - 000 workers , and averted more than 300 threatened- strikes . In an address dealing with the work of the International Labor Organization , Professor Samuel Mc-Curie Lindsay of- Columbia declared that economic recovery was possible only on the basis of international understanding and agreement . He ridiculed the various efforts now being-made to solve the economic crisis through programs based on narrow nationalist aims and methods as doomed to failure . Nationalism and dictatorship , he said , " are played out . " Professor Lindsay believed that concerted international efforts could bring about recovery on the basis of adjustment of prices , wages and profits in a manner that would maintain living standards at an even world level and would permit their gradual improvement . This is not an iridescent dream , he said , " if we can mobilize- the brains and genius for organization , democratic spirit and teamwork of the American - people : " -         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
