The stock question which reporters ask and diplomats evade is : " War ? " <P> In Washington at a State Department press conference last week correspondents nearly fell out of their chairs with astonishment when aged Acting Secretary of State Robert Walton Moore , a diplomat of the old school who normally would be the last person to become loquacious about War , suddenly offered to let himself be quoted on it at length . <P> " I decline to believe that any war involving the leading European nations is about to occur , " cried Mr. Moore with an emphasis which suggested it took effort to decline to believe . " I decline to believe , " vehemently continued the Acting Secretary of State , " that any such adventure in suicide is imminent ! On the contrary , I am convinced that the leaders of those nations , knowing what a perhaps fatal blow another extensive war would be to the fabric of European civilization , will find some common-sense method of adjusting all controversies . Of course all the world would be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <P> Since between the British Foreign Office and the U. S. State Department many intimate personal and individual ties exist , Secretary Moore , as some of his quoters wrote in their dispatches , was perhaps doing his personal best to encourage Britain and France , discourage Germany , Russia and Italy with regard to the efforts of these five states last week in Spain 's " Little World War , " as diplomats were now calling it . During the week journalists of the French Radical Popular Front , which supports the Cabinet of Socialist Premier Lon Blum , launched daily rumors that German troops were arriving in Morocco at Ceuta , only 14 miles across the Straits from Britain 's Gibraltar and " within canonading range ' ' . In London these rumors had galvanic effect . The nervous Duke of Windsor 's nervous intimate friend , British War Secretary Alfred Duff Cooper , who has said in a public address that he considers it his duty to " frighten people out of their wits " with the dangers of War ( TIME , June 22 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferred with burly , square-jawed French War Minister Edouard Daladier , an ambitious politician whose critics have for years implied that he wants to make himself France 's Radical Dictator . <P> After M. Daladier had received Mr. Duff Cooper and the Englishman had read in virtually the entire French press increasingly alarming reports of " Blond Moors " ( Germans ) at Ceuta , he was reminded at the French Foreign Office that not only the Treaty of Versailles but many another bars Germany from Morocco . Simultaneously a French Foreign Office spokesman , not permitting himself to be named , told correspondents that " France will go to any lengths to protect her interests in Morocco ! " To Morocco soon will go M. Daladier and generals of the French G. H. Q.
