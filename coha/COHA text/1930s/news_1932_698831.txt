" " Today this city is unable to meet its natural , proper obligations , " he said . " This investigation  --  and I do n't say it as a criticism , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is some evidence  --  has done much to undermine the value of New York City securities and has done much to make it difficult to market them .

" The Mayor acknowledged that his " day in court " " had not all been pleasant ; but asked the members of the committee to accept his apology for any discourtesy of which he might have been guilty .

" He told them that if they would look to the charter they would find ways to repair it and to repeal the countless sections that put upon the city expenses it could not escape . He assured them that his time and his - efforts as well as those of all the " key men of the city " were at their disposal to discuss constructive changes to the end that the city might be administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " key men " the Mayor said : " The sooner you call them the better , because you have had them disturbed , you have broken down the morale . " " I do n't say this critically , " he added . " It is a fact . You have today most of the records of this city and left most of the departments anemic so they were n't able to carry on . You have records in your committee that the committee counsel can not completely read in the next three years . " THE MAYOR 'S STATEMENT . The full statement of the Mayor follows : I do , however , without criticism and without any hope of interfering with the deliberations of the committee , prefer to say to you that I did recognize , when the resolution was adopted creating the committee , that there was open to the Legislature a great field to do public good , and the practices , or rather the procedure of the committee , its rulings , its apparent motive , its political injection , its personal assaults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , at least ; but I would like to say to the chairman that I hope that time is not far - distant when either through counsel , or otherwise , your committee will give its attention to the reconstruction of an archaic , worn-out , overlapping , out-of-date charter under which complaints- are frequently made , Mr. Chairman , and I make this statement to you publicly at this time , that the cost of the Municipal Government has mounted , and the best evidence of that will be found in a reading of the figures . This committee had an excellent opportunity during the last year and this year to meet the crisis that is now upon the taxpayers of this city . All the criticism , or most of it , that has been leveled against the City Administration for the cost of government can be traced to the mandatory legislation that came from the Legislature , written in the Charter of the City of New York . Blames the Committee in Part . Today the city is unable ' to meet its natural , proper obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a criticism , I will not charge it was purposely done , although there is some evidence  --  has done much to undermine the value of New York City securities , and has done much to make it difficult to market them . But , let us be done with it all . I have had my day in court . It has n't all been pleasant . If I have irritated the committee and if I have appeared to have been annoyed myself I ask you to accept my apology for any discourtesy that I might have been guilty of . You will appreciate , I think , that I am a bit human and I am subject to human emotions . especially When I am forewarned for twelve months that I am going to be put on the spot . However . let us be done with it , if you are through , and if not , just as soon as you are through , let us be done with it and get down to curing the infirmities in this unworkable charter that makes the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which as a result has become a burden on the taxpayers on this city that Is almost unbearable . " Look to Charter , " He Says . We are told that taxes can not be paid and the expenses of the City Government can not be met . Look to the charter . You will find ways to repair it and repeal the countless sections of chapters of State laws that amend and put expenses upon the city of New York that we can not escape from . That is something ? to do . I do n't care how long the period takes . I hope with the close of the two national conventions in Chicago we will be through with . some of the politics . We may not , but let us both hope that the time is not far distant when we will be through with the personalities . the political ambitions , the political vindictiveness. the partisan differences , and let us do something for the taxpayers of the city of New York without asking them to live on headlines . What I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for your courtesy , and say I am open when you get ready to do this , all the key men of this city are at your service , and the sooner you call them in the better , because you have had them disturbed , you have broken down the morale . I do n't say it critically . It is a fact . You have today most of the records of this city and left some of the departments anemic so they were n't able to carry on . You have had records in your committee that the committee counsel can not completely read in the next three years . But you have them . You have kept unofficial records over night . The only point I want to make is that when all this is done , I am hoping , and at the same time assuring you that with every resource I have  --  ply time , my efforts ? are at the disposal of the committee , if they want them , to discuss constructive changes for the City of New York through its of. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am confident of the result , that taxes will be reduced and this city can be administered on a more economic financial basis than it now struggles to do , hampered by a charter forced upon the City of New York from time to time in amendments by men who do n't know the difference between uptown and downtown .
