On the 114th day of this year 's Spanish Civil War , the Radical Madrid Cabinet were driven to flee from the capital last week by the conquering White Armies of singularly humorous and carefree Francisco Franco , a commander who even in the darkest days of his campaign surprised correspondents by keeping up an ebullient and ever-smiling mien to be compared only to that of President Roosevelt . <P> The grim and intense proletarian defender of Madrid , Premier Largo Caballero , and his Cabinet climbed into automobiles , drove rapidly away to Valencia on the seacoast 24 hours after he had declared , like a Chinese general : " Under no circumstances will I abandon Madrid alive ! If the insurgents break through , I will shoot myself . " <P> Arriving in Valencia , 190 miles from Madrid , the Radical Cabinet manifestoed that they had " sacrificed everything to efficiency .

When a wave of advancing Moors were suddenly faced by Red machine guns which popped up out of a trench they simply flung themselves prostrate and waited calmly . The White artillery " bracketed " by dropping one shell behind and another in front of the Red trench , got the range and then blew Reds methodically to bits until survivors ran up white flags .
