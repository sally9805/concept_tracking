txt Charges of entrapment were made against the National Labor Relations b o and at a house committee hear ing today . Eviden c e was p r e s ented that NLRB and CIO officials plotted the strategy which involved the Inland Steel company in its controversy with t h e government over the National Labor Relations act . N a t h an Witt , Nathan Witt. secretary of the labor tioara , was summoned to the- witness chair . Into the record went a memorandum , identified by Vitt , in which he told of a conference with Philip Murray , vice president of the C. 1 . 0 . and chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing committee , and Lee Pressman , general counsel for the C. I. 0 . The conference was held on June 3 , 1937 , and pre-dated by nine days the issuance of a- complaint against the Inland Steel- company . It told in detail of the method by which the- company was to be-proveked into an attitude which - would justify issuance of the complaint . - WitL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , member of the committee , said the evidence ' indicated entrapment of the company by the board and C. 1 . 0 . Representative Harry N. Routzohn R. , Ohio termed it a conspiracy , Vitt defended himself and the board , asserting such conferences were legal altho the act specifies that the board shall have no jurisdiction in a case until after a charge has been filed . 1 ; Witt is the $7,500 a year official whom William M. Leiserson , newest member of the board , ' is seeking to oust , asserting that the secretary has usurped authority and is responsible for most of the board 's troubles . Witt described himself today as 36 years old , a New York City taxi driver who went to Harvard law school , got a degree in ' 1932 , and obtained in 1935 a lucrative position with the Roosevelt administration . Board Authorizes Conference . The conference with the C. I. 0 . representatives was directed by the full board , Witt testified . His memorandum to Charles Fahy , general counsel of the board , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Murray ; chairman of S. W. 0 . C. , and Lee Pressman , ' its general counsel . We explored the situation as it concerns Republic , Youngstown , and Inland Steel , the three companies which are presently being struck by S. W. 0 . C. The principal thing in which S. W. 0 . C. is interested is a quick decision from the board as to whether a written agreement is required if the parties come to an understanding after negotiations , " Since the presentation of . the question to the board is tied up with the question of majority . I explored the latter question first with Murray and Pressman . It then developed that in the case of Inland , S. W. 0 . C. claims to represent a very large majority of the workers , roughly about 85 per cent . It also developed that S. W. O. C. is prepared to disclose its membership lists in the case of Inland . . Tells C. I. 0 --  What to Do . " This being so , 1 Suggested that the quickest way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modify its approach on the majority question and instead of asking bargaining for its own memo bers only , ask- for exclusive bargaining on the basis of its claim to majority representation . " At the same time it could ask for negotiations looking toward a written agreement . All- other things being equal , Inland probably would refuse the request on the ground that collective bargaining dees not require a written agreement even if the parties come to an understanding on the provisions  --  as - they apparently have in this case on the basis of the CarnegieIllinois agreement . - " If at the same time as it makes the demand , S. W. 0 . C. also offers to prove to Inland before- the CVII. ference that it . represents a ma ! ' . * . ity , then Inland 's refusal to negotiate on such a basis would lead to a claim by S. W. 0 . C. that the act had been violated . Prepare for Complaint . " After - checking on this with Mr. Edwin Smith a member of the labor board I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch with Van A. Eittner , the S. W. 0 . C. director in Chicago , and he is checking his books to see whether they are in shape for presentation to the company . If they are , S. W. 0 . C. will make a demand on Inland in the above terms and upon refusal will file a charge . " Upon Mr. Smith 's suggestion , I have been in touch with Sol Dorfman regional board attorney in the Chicago office and he is holding himself open to work on the case . I have already outlined it to him and he is proceeding to get the commerce facts regarding the company . As soon as he does he will draft a complaint so that it will be ready for issuance upon charge being filed . " In the meantime it would be very helpful if the economic staff began immediately gathering material on the question of written agreements so that we could have such material ready for the hearing and for the decision . " Goes Ahead as Planned , This strategy went ahead as planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A memorandum on June 9 from Witt to the labor board informed that Dorfman had reported from Chicago that the steel company would not make a signed contract because the act did not require it . The company was willing to meet with the S. W. 0 . C. at any time for collective bargaining purposes , it stated . The memorandum stated that the S. W. 0 . C. would file a charge with the Chicago office and that a complaint against the company was in readiness for issuance . " Thus the case is proceeding along the lines indicated in my memorandum of June 3 , " Witt noted to the board . Questioned on Elides . " Do you think you were acting within the scope of your authority and your acts were those of a fair , impartial official of the United States ? " Witt was asked by Committee Counsel Edmund Toland. " 1 was not binding the board , " said Witt . " The whole C. I. 0 . strategy was discussed by you , " remarked Hellcat . " Do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them into a situation where.y a complaint would be issued ? " " I do n't think so , " replied Witt . " As a lawyer , did you ever hear of champerty , the stirring up of strife illegally ? " asked Routzohn , " I think this constitutes a conspiracy , " Lengthy Hearing Held . Lengthy hearings were held in the summer of 1937 before a trial examiner , Charles A. ' Jima , on the Inland Steel case . Wood 's attitude , while he was conducting these hearings in a quasi-judicial capacity , was shown in letters to the board . He scoffed at the evidence produced by co. pany lawyers and used obscene phrases in reference to witnesses for the company . " I 've just returned from an evening session at which respondents the company tried to pull some more of their rough stuff , " he wrote in August , 1937 . " They were all set to stage another scene with loud wail . ing of unfair hearing and succeeded only in making themselves ridiculous . " Personally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I am a little afraid that the courts on appeal will be much impressed with the total number of witnesses . " On Oct. 11 , 1937 , the case was transferred for hearings before the board itself . A final order against the company was entered more than a year later , Nov. 12 , 1933 , and an appeal is now pending in the federal courts . C. I. ** Tieup Aired . The morning session of the commit . tee hearing was occupied by more testimony from Philip G. Phillips , regional director of the board at Cincinnati , concerning the connections of the communist party and the C. I. 0 . in that city , Yesterday the committee heard evidence that the board ordered the prosecution of an unfair labor case because C. I. 0 . leaders said they were obligated to communists . Repeated questioning concerning this incident brought from Phillips today the statement that a communist is entitled to the same protection from the Wagner act as members of other political parties unless he is engaged protection , " the witness said . Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remarked Chairman Howard W. Smith D. , Va. , " that the communist party is a party whose principle is to foment trouble in the United States and to bring about a revolution as exists in Russia . Is it the position of the labor board to employ a man who advocates those principles ? " Phillips again said that he did not believe under the Wagner act that an employer could deny employment to a man simply because of his political belief .
