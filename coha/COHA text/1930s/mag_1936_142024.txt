In Chicago last week the directors and principal stockholders of Spiegel , May , Stern Co . Inc. , mail-order house , sat down in a buff-paneled room a mile west of Comiskey Ball Park to approve three timely measures : 1 ) a five-for-one split in the company 's common stock , creating 1,265,000 shares out of 253,000 now outstanding ; 2 ) an extra dividend of $2 a share on the present common ; 3 ) a change of their corporate name to Spiegel , Inc . Each in its own way , these three acts celebrated a remarkable feat of applied business science . It was applied in 1932 with the result that Spiegel 's has earned as much in the past four rocky years as in the 27 years of its previous mail-order life . <P> Like many another U. S. business , Spiegel , May , Stern woke up in 1932 with a bad hangover . From 1929 to 1932 it lost $2,575,000 . Unlike its big neighbor , Montgomery Ward , it was shackled to no failing chain stores , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandising methods . Spiegel 's needed brains . For $100,000 a year , Ward 's acquired this necessity from U. S. Gypsum Co. in the person of Sewell Lee Avery . Spiegel 's found it in the family . Modie Joseph Spiegel Jr. , ten years out of Dartmouth , had been making money in the apparel department when most other departments were falling fast . Big , jovial Board Chairman " M. J. Sr. " gave him the job of general manager . <P> Energetic Modie Jr . decided Spiegel 's required housecleaning . In place of the 2,700,000 catalogs which had been sent out hit or miss in 1929 , he made up a more selective list , 900,000 shorter , on which he began to double the returns . The money he saved on publishing he spent on fancying up the catalog , testing products and types of illustration and copy . He created a department to study the costs of business getting , cut them down to about 5% of the price of each item compared to the usual 10% in mail-order houses . He discovered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stoves , tires , men 's clothes . And he developed Spiegel 's two cardinal policies : 1 ) sell everything on credit ; 2 ) sell more goods to fewer customers . <P> Time payments , Modie believed , kept the name of Spiegel 's sweet in the customer 's mind . So also did supplements to the old half-yearly catalogs , and other literature which he mailed out every ten days or so . More remarkable was Modie 's minimum sales policy . Because it is obviously cheaper to service a few large accounts than many small ones , Spiegel 's now refuses cash orders under $5 . The average sale in a mail-order house is around $3 . Spiegel 's sales average $15 . <P> The company now has 1,400,000 regular customers and fills about 3,000,000 orders a year . After a loss of $300,000 in 1932 it made $1,317,716 in 1933 , $2,749,362 in 1934 , $2,331,800 in 1935 , and will make an estimated $2,700,000 this year . Spiegel common stock , which faded to 62 in 1932 , was selling last week at $113. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
