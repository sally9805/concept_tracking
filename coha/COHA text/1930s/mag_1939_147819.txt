Every year , to save their lives from cancer of the larynx , 400 people in the U. S. have their Adam 's apples removed . The stump of windpipe which remains is turned over and pulled through a hole in the front of the neck , at the point where a collar button usually rests . Through this hole larynx-less patients ( mostly men ) do their breathing . But they can not talk aloud , for their breath gushes up in a storm from their lungs , whistles out through their necks , and first requirement for speech is a vibrating column of air in the throat . They sometimes manage to produce a squeaky whisper , using only their mouths and palates . <P> A few bold patients taught themselves to speak by swallowing air and belching it out in grunts , but until Temple University 's Dr. Nathaniel Martin Levin built belch-talk into a system , most larynxless men could never hope to speak again . During the past three years , brief , brisk Dr. Levin has taught 30 men belch-talk . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days to learn , is most successful when started right after the operation . A patient swallows air through his mouth , pushes it right out again with his abdominal muscles , chops it into speech with his teeth , tongue and lips as he expels it . Easiest type of word to learn is one like " church , " formed with teeth and lips . Hardest is a guttural sound in the back of the throat , like " gang . " Belch-talk is easy to understand but so husky that patients are often asked if they have a cold . <P> Among successful belchers in good society : a New York lawyer who argues cases in court , a Philadelphia magistrate , several teachers . During the past month , Dr. Levin , with Dr. Chevalier Lawrence Jackson , has shown belching sound films before the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology , the American College of Surgeons . Last week in Manhattan he disclosed to Lawyer Arturo Alessandri , ex-President of Chile , this interesting fact : patients who lose their larynxes do not lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they make the same mistakes .
