Two LOVES I HAVE-Clara Longworth de Chambrun-Lippincott ( $2.50 ) . <P> The plain man-in-the-street sometimes feels that William Shakespeare never existed at all as a real person , or that perhaps he actually was Francis Bacon or an incarnation of Ignatius Donnelly in disguise . Most experts agree , however , that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon was the Shakespeare of the Plays and Sonnets which are still the highest peak in the jagged outline of English literature . But there remain many mysterious gaps in Shakespeare 's personal history . Who , for instance , was the famed Dark Lady of the Sonnets Bernard Shaw and the late Frank Harris " proved " she was Mary Fitton , maid-of-honor at Elizabeth 's court . Countess de Chambrun ( Cincinnati-born sister of the late Nicholas Longworth ) thinks the Dark Lady was Mistress Nan Davenant , wife of an Oxford innkeeper . <P> Countess de Chambrun bases her romanticized tale of Shakespeare 's career on " two score years of personal research , " which includes a knowledge of the latest diggings among Shakespeare 's bones . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Chambrun portrays : perhaps Shakespeare really was mixed up in Papist alarums and Essex ' plot ; perhaps he went to Scotland and had a fine clack with King James . But Author de Chambrun , though she is a bright lady and writes a conscientious romance , has not the vivifying touch . Readers will get more of an inkling about Shakespeare the man in reading three of his sonnets than by attending 30 such fancy-dress parties as Two Loves I Have .
