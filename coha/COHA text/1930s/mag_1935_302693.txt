Few U. S. industries can collect from their customers year after year an admission fee for the privilege of inspecting a product they wish to buy . Yet last week in Manhattan tens of thousands shuffled in line to pay 75-the price of a Broadway cinema ticket-to see the U. S. automobile , Model 1935 . <P> Sponsored for the first time by local dealers , the 35th annual New York Automobile Show was , for the first time in years , a dignified affair . The crowd went in larger numbers than ever before . Private hotel shows were banned by mutual agreement . In some 200 forms they saw the burnished , bulbous , gleaming thing of beauty that is a modern car . <P> Ahead of the Industry was what even-one , from Henry Ford down , agreed would be a better year than last ( see p. 59 ) . Behind was a year that had all the fixings of prosperity but little of the turkey . Production of passenger cars and trucks in 1934 was 2,885,000 units , up 45% from 1933 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 589,000 units , up 65% . Yet profits failed to keep pace with volume because of higher prices for labor and materials . Average automobile costs last week were estimated to be 18% above a year ago . <P> The so-called independents were still independent despite persistent rumors of corporate flirtations ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) . And they were still scrapping for a 10% slice of the market left them by the Big Three . Only Franklin had fallen by the wayside within the year . <P> During the twelve-month the U. S. spent $2,200,000,000 on motor vehicles , tires , parts , accessories , and $2,700,000,000 on gasoline-a total of $4,900,000,000 , about one-tenth of the national income . Deaths by automobiles last year rose 16% to an all-time record of 36,000 . <P> The New Cars that the motormakers of the land assembled in Manhattan last week looked more alike as a group than at any time since the turn of the Century , when all cars looked like buggies . For what it may be worth-and there is no agreement on its value-streamlining in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radiator grilles Vshaped and sloping , rears smoothed out in sweeping lines . Bodies were longer and wider , motors more economical . <P> Automotive engineers worked most of the year on riding quality . The mechanical feature of last year 's Show , independent front-wheel springing , was abandoned by some makers , improved by others and in a few cases developed for the first time . A number attacked the riding problem from the point of view of weight distribution by moving the motor forward . Free-wheeling is on the decline , and dual-ratio axles or over-drives permitting slower motor speeds at high road speeds are on the rise . More powerful brakes require less foot pressure . Crankcases are ventilated , generators larger to carry the load of radios and heaters . Prices are generally unchanged but several manufacturers have added lower-priced lines of the same name . <P> Auburn brought three lines to show , led by a yellow sport roadster with exposed exhausts and a supercharged engine . Guaranteed speed : 100 m.p.h . Long and handsomely streamlined , the Auburns looked as if Errett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift and flashy market , as he did to his great profit in the first years of Depression .
