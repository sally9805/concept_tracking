The Perfect Specimen ( Warner Bros. ) experiments with the solemn hypothesis that a boy may be nurtured to-all-round perfection in a sort of social vacuum ; but that when he is tested against assorted worldliness he will relapse into human frailty . Irish Cinemactor Errol Flynn , a godlike young man of limited acting ability , performs the title role , and in demonstrating his perfection is at one point required to take most of his clothes off. * In this picture he labors under the screen name of Gerald Beresford Wicks , who has been schooled in all the arts and sciences by a bossy grandmother ( May Robson ) , to fit him for the Wicks fame &; fortune . His planned life gets out of hand when Mona Carter ( Joan Blondell ) crashes her car through the Wickstead fence , discovers the perfect specimen testing a Newtonian theory by falling out of a tree . With very little urging , Gerald reacts like a perfectly normal and admirably coordinated human . He pursues Mona , impresses her by flattening a tough guy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers ' picnic , goes to work as a mechanic , conducts a merry courtship while Grandma Wicks and the nation 's police beat the bushes for him . Set-tos with such surrealities as mad Poet Killigrew Shawe ( Hugh Herbert ) and the truckmen give Gerald 's education the final polish . He goes home , gives tyrannical Grandma Wicks a piece of his mind , decides that Mona knows best . <P> <P> The Great Garrick ( Warner Bros . ) . As different from the cinema 's typical period romance as champagne from sack , Ernest Vajda 's figmentary episode in the life of 18th Century Play Actor David Garrick fits the Hollywood gag into the elaborate frame of Georgian humor . Garrick , who played Macbeth in the uniform of a Hanoverian general , might have enjoyed this modernization . He probably would have chuckled at his 1937 impersonator , debonair , English Brian Aherne , stealing scenes from noted Scene-Stealer Edward Everett Horton , but would certainly have advised some rewriting in the interest of pace . <P> The Vajda story has Garrick invited to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him there flies the rumor that he is coming over to teach the Frenchmen how to act . The angered members of the French company prepare an extravagant hoax , take over an inn Garrick must stop at en route , man it with players from their troupe .

Horton ) affect serene indifference to the staged hubbub . <P> When a frightened young woman ( Olivia de Havilland ) arrives with a fluttery story about a wrecked coach , Garrick accepts her as part of the plot , grandly surrenders his rooms to her . While he feigns concern for her safety and distress during the continued ructions , he decides she is a very bad actress .
