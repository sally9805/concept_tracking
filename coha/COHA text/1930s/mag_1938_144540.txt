The House Naval Affairs Committee last week set May 16 as the day it will begin hearings on Representative Emanuel Celler 's Pan American Broadcasting Station Bill . This measure would : 1 ) authorize the Navy Department to construct and operate a $700,000 Government broadcasting station ( with $50,000 for annual maintenance ) with power and equipment adequate not only for short wave broadcasting to South America but for the whole U. S. ; 2 ) instruct the Commissioner of Education to provide programs of national and international interest , running the full educational and entertainment gamut covered by commercial broadcasters . <P> Representative Celler comes from Brooklyn , and so has a very real and very natural dread of Naziism . Fundamentally he designed his bill to provide the U. S. with means of competing with short-wave propaganda regularly broadcast for the past four or five years from Europe 's totalitarian countries . Of the 30-odd bills pending in House &; Senate to muscle Government further into radio , the Celler Bill is closest to the hearing stage and is , therefore , hated &; feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio industry already provides ample technical and artistic facilities for South American propaganda broadcasting . In spite of Representative Celler 's contention that one Government station will scarcely interfere with the 728 private stations now licensed in the U. S. , what particularly pains the broadcasters is the idea of domestic Government broadcasting . It sounds too much like the yardstick principle which is currently turning utility men 's hair snowy white . <P> Therefore , with the Celler Bill hearings about to open in Washington this week , the QRX signal to stand by hummed through the U. S. radio industry . A more important fight than was ever put on the air-the match between the two great opposing philosophies of broadcasting- was about to begin . In this corner-the legislators and Government officials who look on radio as too vast and permeating a moral instrument to be left ungoverned by the body politic , too valuable a natural resource to be left free from State control . In that corner-the private broadcasters who have an estimated $150,000,000 invested in plant , who last year made some $140,000,000 from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whole nation . <P> This week 's fight will have the additional flavor of a return match , for Government and private broadcasters have crossed gloves off &; on for 26 years . <P> 1912 to McNinch , The 1912 Radio Communication Act antedates the birth of broadcasting . The license plan adopted at that time was a system of registry for the three radio groups then active : the Navy , private companies engaged in ship communications and the small group of early-bird amateurs . Anybody who applied got a license . Its issuance was part of the job of the Secretary of Commerce , a very small part until 1920 when KDKA ( Pittsburgh ) applied for the first wireless telephone broadcasting station license . The Secretary granted it a wave length of 360 meters , continued issuing other stations licenses on the same wave length until 1923.
