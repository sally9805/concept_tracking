In 982 A.D. a fleet of little dragon-prowed ships with red sails moved slowly westward from Iceland . Somewhere in the grey Atlantic their Norwegian outlaw leader Eric the Red expected to find a new land . North Atlantic gales blew up . Many a little ship foundered , its red-bearded vikings drowned stolidly in their iron helmets and shirts of mail . But Eric sailed on until he came on a mountainous waste of land . Four years later he sailed there again with 14 shiploads of colonists , survivors of 25 ships that had tacked away from Iceland . Not because his new land was briefly luxuriant in summer , but because " people would like better to come there if it had a good name , " Eric the Red called it Greenland . When his colonists looked at the miserable winter waste they howled " Swindle ! " He dumped them brusquely ashore just the same . <P> For three centuries Greenland was a republic . In 1261 it became a Norwegian colony and a government ship went once a year to Greenland ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman found only graves and Eskimos in Greenland . The Norse skeletons showed the effects of scurvy and rickets . In 1721 a Norwegian missionary tried again to make Greenland a white man 's land , and Norway began to ship its convicts to Greenland . But in 1814 Norway lost Greenland . It was done by an Irishman 's " lie " that last week reverberated through Norway and Denmark . <P> King Frederick VI of Norway &; Denmark , having sided with Napoleon , was forced to cede Norway to Sweden . At the peace table it was read , " King Frederick cedes the kingdom of Norway with all its dependencies . ... " A smart Dane put in quickly , " excepting Greenland , the Faroes and Iceland . " An Irishman named Edmund Bourke added , " These colonies have never belonged to Norway . " In 1814 Norwegians , rankling at Sweden , scarcely noticed the lie or the loss of Greenland . They continued to hunt and seal on its gloomy eastern coast . The Danes claimed only the west coast . Greenland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly decided all Greenland was worth having . Like an ant with a dead beetle , it claimed sovereignty over an area 50 times as big as itself . Startled were Norwegians who had always quietly thought and quietly said that eastern Greenland was theirs . They began to remember Eric the Red 's drowned vikings , the seals and the lie , began to mutter that Norway had been put upon . <P> In 1931 Norway 's little-known Arctic Council of peppery explorers warned Norway that Danes were planning to explore East Greenland , secure it for Denmark ( TIME , June 8 , 1931 et seq . ) . Acting quickly , Norway sent half a dozen men to plant the Norwegian flag among the sad-eyed Eskimos and puffins on a 350-mile strip of the eastern coast which they named Eric the Red Land . A year later another Norwegian expedition " seized " ' more of East Greenland . <P> Denmark 's rage at this " impudence " was not softened by the fact that Denmark had ruled Greenland philanthropically at a loss . It could easily have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration except for some 300 Danish cryolite miners . Its policy is to keep Greenland safe for the " kindhearted , trusting Eskimos . " To keep Eskimos happy , Denmark now furiously claimed every foot of Greenland .
