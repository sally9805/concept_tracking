 | My Child Was Crippled Condensed from The Forum Anonymous DALINE was nearly two years old before we knew definitely that there was something wrong with her . At first she seemed to be just a healthy , bright infant . When she reached the end of her first year and showed no interest in trying to walk we did n't worry . But as the months wore on and still the baby made no effort , I took her to a pediatrician who told me that the child had probably received a head injury from the instruments used at birth , resulting in a spastic condition affecting the lower limbs . An orthopedic surgeon verified this diagnosis and told me frankly that , while spastic conditions often responded to treatment and surgery , they were never completely curable and that to some extent Adaline always would be crippled . My first reaction was a fierce determination to shield my weakling , to make up for her disability by an overflowing love that approached hysteria . I almost resented my other children because they might lessen the completeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remembered one home where an invalid was made the central figure around whom the family life revolved . The constraint on the well members of the family was appalling and the effects upon the invalid far from desirable . With so grim an object lesson in mind , I decided that my task was , first of all , to keep a normal , happy home , so that my three able-bodied children might have a sound environment and my handicapped child the outlook of a person normal physically . I would do all I could to see that her life was as full as it could be made , but Adaline would have to adapt herself to the world , since the world would never conform to her limitations . I put Adaline 's case in the hands of a leading orthopedic surgeon . He first operated on her when she was five . During the following 11 years his treatment changed Adaline from a child who could scarcely walk at all , who , as an adult would have been barred from almost every normal activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wears no brace , and can go anywhere alone , although she can not dance or participate in active sports . Such progress did not come overnight . It took four painful surgical operations , various types of massage and physiotherapy treat-  | ments , endless special exercises . The results from these exercises were imperceptibly slow and had to be pursued with unfaltering perseverance . I set aside a certain hour , never permitting anything to interfere , and during the remainder of the day we did not even mention those exercises . My husband and I made it a rule never to discuss in the family circle Adaline 's treatments and operations . We never behaved as though the surgical operations were spectacular events . The result was that Adaline and her two brothers and sister took the whole business with amazing juvenile composure . When Adaline was in the hospital the children took her toys and games , but all emphasis was placed on how glad we should be to have her home , never on how much we pitied her . The greatest difficulty came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their head-shaking after each operation made me want to strangle them . They always exclaimed , " another operation ! " Their tone implied that we had tried surgery once , and , since it could work no miracle , we should abandon it . As long as a lame child can get about to play at all , he seems pathetic neither to himself nor to his youthful friends . Time and again I have felt positively humble at the philosophical wisdom with which Adaline 's contemporaries disposed of her limitation : There were certain things Adaline could n't do , but that need n't matter too much , because there were other things she could do . When they organized games they gave her the parts she could do . When she fell , as she often did , they asked , " Are you hurt ? " And when she was n't , things went on as before . I kept an ample supply of games Adaline could enjoy , but I had also a table tennis set , three pairs of roller skates , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never was guilty of saying , " Oh , now , do n't play that ; play something Adaline can enjoy too . " Knowing that she would sorely need both physical and mental courage , I carried on an unobtrusive campaign to release Adaline from fear . The first step was pets ? kittens and dogs . When she was eight we bought a Shetland pony . Adaline did n't ride very well , of course , but her control over that docile beast gave her added self-confidence . When she was 12 she was taught to swim . She 's no wonderful swimmer , but she 's capable of taking care of herself in water . And when she was i6 she learned to drive an automobile . Often we harbor the erroneous impression that a lame child is essentially a saint . But a lame child has just as much talent for selfishness , conceit , untruthful-  | ness , or any other unpleasant characteristic as a robust child . Adaline was no better and no worse than my other children , and I insisted upon exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , in our home it has always been understood that each child puts away his playthings . Adaline loved dragging out every toy in the place and she hated clearing up after her play . Often I should have liked to put things away for her , because the actual work of putting them away required a lot more physical effort from her than from the others . I did n't succumb to this mistaken kindness . I believed that Adaline should have the same responsibility that the other children shouldered . Here , again , relatives disapproved of my Spartan attitude . My mother said , " If she were my child , I 'd give her anything she wants ; there 's time enough later on for her to suffer . " In other words , let her grow up a spoiled hellion and , when she 's an unbearable adult , she can find out to her sorrow that the world wo n't give her everything she wants just because she 's lame . Adaline was nearly 10 before she could go to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that many interesting doors would always be closed to her , I was watchful to cultivate any special talents and interests she displayed . I saw to it that she had piano lessons , took her to children 's concerts , bought her records of the simpler symphonies , and a child 's book giving the stories of the operas . The only definite talent Adaline evidenced was in drawing . She did so well that I had trouble with her adult relatives . They decided she was a genius and began to point out the various geniuses who had had maimed bodies ! I am extremely unsympathetic with such attitudes ? I wanted Adaline to draw merely because she enjoyed it . If , later on , she could do something special with it , all right . But I was n't going to permit her relatives to oblige her to be an artist . Relations grew pretty strained over- this point just as , when Adaline came out with a high I.Q. in some intelligence tests at school , I had difficulty in restraining two of her aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had the best brain in our family . It was not until late adolescence that Adaline 's lameness appeared truly tragic to her . Of course this was the time Adaline should have started going out with boys ? and did n't . There were several who liked well enough to come in and work algebra problems with Adaline or play cards with her . But taking her out ? a date ? was another question , and missing out on the complete social popularity  | any young girl desires was a bitter dose to her . There was almost nothing I could do to soften this blow . Let her popular sister see to it that Adaline had dates ? Often my older daughter , in perplexed distress , asked if she should do this . My answer was an emphatic negative . I knew that Adaline would see through any such plan and that it would hurt her pride . There was only one thing I could do , and that was to try to prevent the sensitiveness Adaline was acquiring from coloring her mental outlook . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable rival was a pretty girl who was one of the school 's social lights . Adaline 's gloating at victory over this girl was alarming . " Why are you so glad to win over Lucille ? " I asked . Taken off guard , she answered exactly what was in her heart : " She may be the most popular girl at school and all the boys may be crazy about her , but I showed her that she ca n't have everything . " That was all I needed . I had the long talk I 'd been waiting for . I told Adaline that she must not let a lame body result in a lame mind , that her true victory would come when and if her reactions to life were those of a person without any physical disability . When I finished I was n't certain I 'd done any good . But I soon saw that I had . I believe that afterwards , Adaline never made faces at anything until she felt convinced that her attitude was not prejudiced by her handicap . Secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought financial independence would give her an assurance nothing else could . But when my frail one , at the end of her second year at the university , announced that she 'd prefer to go to New York for six months of art work and then on to Paris to study design for a year , I was left mentally gasping . At the age of 20 she no longer felt the need to be near a protecting arm . This was a little more than I had bargained for . But I turned a deaf ear on my maternal instinct and the incredulous indignation of relatives , and helped her carry out her plans . She had not been gone a month before I knew from her letters that her battle was won . Away from her family for the first time in her life , she was making friends , confident that they could like her for herself alone . Whatever social inhibitions she had harbored were dropping away . I shall always remember how very casually she wrote , " I went this evening with a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No further explanations , but she wanted me to know . The year in Paris accented this healthful freedom . She had so many interests that there was no time to  | worry over those doors that must always be closed to her . When she returned , she was as poised and assured as any young woman of 22 could possibly be . Today , at 27 , Adaline does hard work that she enjoys in the interior decorating department of a large store . She 's extremely capable in both her business and personal life . She is n't married but she has had proposals , and she will probably marry within the next few years . I feel saddened over nothing about her except the remembrance that I was not wise enough to find some way to make happy those years of her late adolescence . Not long ago we were in a group where a thoughtless person referred scornfully to somebody as a cripple . Afterwards I mentioned to Adaline the pain the remark had given me . She looked at me in astonishment . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph for me . The man who said that is n't intentionally unkind ; he had forgotten all about my lameness . " She was right . He had forgotten . And so do many people forget , because she forgets it so superbly herself .
