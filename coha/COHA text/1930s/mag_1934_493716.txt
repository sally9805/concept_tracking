The truth is that James was running counter to the main stream of English fiction of his time , emphasizing form in a period when the novel had become hasty and sprawling , and little more than a department of journalism , advocating the consci ? ous isolation of the artist when his colleagues were becoming entangled in the political confusions of Fabian socialism , and , finally , insisting that his char ? acters be aware , highly developed , conscious indi ? viduals at a time when English fiction was being swamped with its countless portraits of immaturity and frustration . In this last , I think , can be found the deepest reason for the revival of interest in his work . The impulse that was apparent in James 's day in the work of Maugham or Bennett has come to its logical flowering and we have had too much of a fiction that presented the world in terms of child ? ish groping or of bewildered acquiescence to events . James 's characters may indeed be too subtle , too aware , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelists are frequently just as unbal ? anced , though on the side of dulness and passivity . Consciousness , " finely aware and richly responsi ? ble , " was James 's one absolute ; his attention in any situation was focused on the individual who felt that situation most deeply . Ethics were subordi ? nated to awareness ; cheats and liars were welcomed to his novels , but only if they knew what they were doing : I never see the leading interest in any human hazard but in a consciousness ... subject to fine intensification and wide enlargement . It is as mirrored in that con ? sciousness chat the gross fools , the headlong fools , the fatal fools , play their part for us ? they have much less to show us in themselves .... This means , exactly , that the person capable of feeling in the given case more than another of what is to be felt for it , and so serving in the highest degree to record it , dramatically and ob ? jectively , is the only sort of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapen , or , as we say , give away , the beauty and value of the thing . If that text had sunk more deeply into our literary traditions we might have been spared some of our epics of bewilderment , some of our prose celebra ? tions of spinelessness and fatigue . Our proletarian novelists , for instance , might be induced to part company with that story about the defeated strike as seen through the eyes of one of its more back ? ward victims , and take up the more dramatic issues of leadership , of organization and strategy , as visu ? alized by the most highly developed individuals in ? volved . For although James seems to provide a whole arsenal of argument and illustration for the critics who advocate the conscious isolation of the artist from political and social conflicts , his deepest meaning is reserved for those who hold more revo ? lutionary philosophies . They can understand his attitude toward his own class , and perhaps add the indignation that he never expressed ; his " hierar ? chizing " of characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts of class and political consciousness . The question of technique is another matter , but it can be said of him , as it can not be said of Proust and Joyce , that the tech ? nique he developed is equally good for both sides . THE WORKERS ' BILL , introduced into the last Congress as H. R. 7598 by Con ? gressman Lundeen of Minnesota , has ac ? quired a new significance since the Conference on Economic Security , called by the Secretary of Labor in Washington on November 14 , proved to be the occasion for the President to set severe limits to the administration 's program for social insurance . It does not appear that the legislation likely to be proposed will touch the real issue of present unemployment . In fact , the President said , regard ? ing the recommendations on social insurance that he has promised to make to the incoming Con ? congress : On some points it is possible to be definite . ' Unem ? employment insurance will be in the program . .. . This part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no less important that all **30;350;TOOLONG funds be held and in ? vested by the federal government .. . . It must be financed by contributions , not taxes .... We must get them those now on relief back into productive em ? employment , and as we do so we can bring them under the protection of the insurance system . Thus insurance is not to apply to the present unem ? ployed . Old-age security and health insurance are postponed for further consideration , and the " first task " Is stated by the President to be to get the economic system to function so that there will be a greater general security . Everything that we do with intent to increase the security of the individual will , I am sure , be a stimulus to recovery . Therefore , as in the past program of the New Deal , restoration of business is the point of attack , rather than income , which appears to be the decisive factor in the maladjustment between production and consumption . The depression is not merely the downward stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? come of the American people . Hitherto recovery from the low point of a cycle has come about through some stimulus to start purchasing . Scarcity of goods in consumers ' hinds after a period of suspended buying has been met by lower prices or favorable conditions for credit at some strategic point in the production cycle . But naturally this conjunction results in recovery only if there is in ? come in consumers ' hands to be drawn out by such a stimulus to purchase ; and this income must bear some effective relation to the capacity for immediate output in response to the expectation of revival.The failure to achieve recovery after the stimulation to produce in the early summer of 1933 revealed the crisis in income . Today the difficulty in " pumping credit into business " further reveals that business needs , not credit but customers . The crisis is in the market ; and behind the market , with its effort to attract buyers , is the crisis in the people 's income . It has declined as a whole , and its losses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulk of the necessities of life . This crisis in income challenges at once the older forms of social insurance that were initiated in European countries in earlier periods of economic development . Essentially the idea of insurance is to lessen losses by sharing them , drawing on a com ? mon pool of resources . By the law of chance , these losses do not all happen to all individuals at once . Thus the common pool diminishes the individual burden by distributing it in a group and by provid ? ing for it in advance . Needs are measurable for a group that are not exactly predictable for the in ? dividual . Thus insurance applies to death payments foreseeable through measuring the average expec ? tation of length of life . Less exact and therefore always more expensive and less secure is provision for losses due to sickness or accident . The smaller the group covered , the more difficult it is to predict losses . The larger the number of individuals ex ? posed at a given time to the hazard , the more ex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less secure the insurance . Hence actuarial insurance , in a technical sense , applied to unemployment arising out of industrial depression breaks down when unemployment attains mass proportions . If the insurance has been in the form of reserves in an individual establishment , large or small , reserves are speedily exhausted . If it has been a fund covering all establishments in given industries and based upon contributions from government , employers and employees , as in Great Britain , reserves last longer but must likewise be exhausted in the effort to compensate all at once the unpredictably large number of individuals who are simultaneously affected by a hazard not properly insurable in the old sense of counting on the escape from the hazard , at least at a given time , of enough individuals to divide the loss when it occurs to others in the group . Facing this situation , some exponents of social insurance in the United States say : Do not expect unemployment insurance to do more than its past forms have accomplished . Let reserves be set up to be drawn on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual of not more than ten weeks , sixteen weeks or six months in the year . Let the benefits be limited to individuals with a given length of employment in the state or in the establishment in the preceding year . Let the scheme cover only certain industries and occupations , excluding , for example , farmers and agricultural laborers , pro ? fessional workers of various types and the self-employed ; and excluding , too , the present unem ? ployed from all benefits until they are again em ? ployed and again laid off . All these limitations come about primarily be ? cause the old concept of insurance as protection against a risk measurable in advance breaks down as each recurrent industrial depression becomes more widespread and more intense than could have been predicted from any past experience . Under the pressure of mass needs , the older types of social insurance in England or in Germany have been found wanting and have had to be supplemented by the government . The " uncovenanted " benefits in England are an example . The fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met even limited needs offers the only satisfactory hope of meeting fully the same needs that lie beyond the limits . The worker whose unemployment benefit stops after fourteen weeks and who is then without any income finds his problem of loss of work and wages merely post ? poned . The actuary may explain to him that in ? surance , by its nature , can not cover all his needs . The answer of the masses is that government and industry must meet those needs in some way . The unemployed prefer fixed insurance , as a right , to relief , which they know by experience is uncertain and subject to change irrespective of need . They are using the term " social insurance , " preceded by the adjective " genuine , " to define the obligation of government and industry to compensate for losses through unemployment that is beyond the control of the workers , individually or collectively . This is essentially the significance of the ' Work ? ers ' Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill . The bill is brief and in its present form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principle and policy than an orthodox measure with proper safeguards against the risks of unconstitutionality . It calls for " insurance for all workers and farmers , unem ? ployed through no fault of their own , in amounts equal to average local wages . " It sets as a minimum $10 per week plus $3 for each dependent . It asks for administration through " unemployment-insur ? ance commissions composed of the rank-and-file members of workers ' and farmers ' organizations , " and provides for control by these groups " under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor . " It declares it to be " the sense of Congress " that the funds shall be obtained " by taxing inherit ? ance and gifts and . . . individual and corporation incomes of $5,000 per year and over . " All workers and farmers are covered in all occupations and for all time lost , and the usual provision is included that payment of insurance shall not be withheld because of refusal to work in place of strikers or at less than normal or trade-union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Secretary of Labor is directed to establish similar social insurance to compensate for all loss of wages due to part-time work , accidents , sickness or maternity . It is unnecessary to pause over some of the tech ? nical defects in the drawing of the present bill . Changes may be made in this respect when it is introduced into the next Congress . Its significance rests upon this different concept of social insurance which it embodies as compared with the traditional proposals growing out of European experience and the modifications of these that have been put for ? ward in American programs . Virtually it declares that mass unemployment must be met by mass com ? pensation . Mass provision by government and in ? industry to provide for mass insecurity is the new definition of social insurance . The demand is put forward that compensation shall be sufficient to pre ? vent the lowering of standards of living . There should be no contributions from workers , since such contributions are essentially a deduction from work ? ers ' income for living standards and compel workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are beyond their control . The source of funds should be such as to be least likely to be directly transferred to the consumer in higher prices which , again , lower workers ' stand ? ards of living . Hence the source should be an in ? come tax , not a tax on payrolls , which would be a direct item in cost of production . In other words , what is demanded is that the economic system as a whole , through taxation , should provide compensa ? tion for unemployment , primarily by diverting funds from channels otherwise leading to new in ? vestments , to purchasing power for wage earners and salaried workers , who would spend the money for immediate necessities of life . Can the government and owners of wealth pay the bill ? In effect , the answer of the masses is that , given so great a productive capacity that goods must be destroyed , it is a reasonable demand that the unemployed be given the purchasing power which , as the surplus of resources shows , has not been paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods produced . From this point of view , unemployment insurance is a kind of deferred wage bill . As such , it is to be administered by workers for the same reason that they control their own wages after they are paid . What is involved , then , is a new statement of policy . It is conceivable that Congress should be called upon to make some such legislative declara ? tion as the following : It shall be the national policy , in the interest of the general welfare , to prevent the disastrous results to family life and individual health and wellbeing due to involuntary unemployment and consequent loss of income by workers , in whatever industry or occupation they are employed ; and to prevent the obstructions to interstate commerce which arise out of the inability to maintain a proper balance between consumption and productive capacity during periods of mass unemploy ? ment . To the end of preventing the lowering of stand ? ards of living and the disturbance of industry due to lack of purchasing power , a nationwide system of social insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes and divert them into pur ? chasing power for the necessities of life of those who derive their livelihood primarily from wages , salaries or self-employment . Incidentally , it is fairly well established that Congress has the constitutional right to formulate public policy , and that these declarations of public policy are not subjects of judicial review . It is note ? worthy , moreover , that the setting up of a social-insurance system that would conform to such a national policy need not in itself carry an appropria ? tion . It could be a claim upon the national govern ? mental budget , in the same class with the other divisions of the government . When the national budget is passed each year , the extent of unemploy ? ment would determine the appropriation . The challenge is a bold one . Obviously it cuts across bankers ' demands for restoration of a more restricted governmental budget . But it establishes that the bankers could , if they really wished it , get credit into circulation . A bold stroke that diverted frozen credit into consumers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of " recovery " than a balanced budget and an effort to persuade industry to assume more debts . Here a word of caution is necessary . It is by no means certain that this distribution would actually result in eliminating unemployment , for something more than purchasing power is needed to make the productive machinery run smoothly and without interruption . Economic security is probably unat ? tainable except in a planned economy . But that is another story . Social insurance can not ensure recur . ity ; it can only ensure compensation for insecurity , At any rate , it should be emphasized that the Workers ' Bill proposes to put expenditure for the necessities of life on an organized basis of compen. sation for unemployment , to take the place of the uncertainties of relief . Paradoxically , other forms of unemployment insurance are not intended for the present unemployed , and for the future unemployed it is easy to foresee the point at which they would break down when reserves were exhausted . Though the bill has been supported by the Com ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which Communists have a leading place , it has nevertheless enlisted support in workers ' associations of no political affiliation . All the political parties , in fact , now advocate at least the principle of unemployment insurance . Nor is it only industrial workers who are demanding in ? surance . The Interprofessional Association for Social Insurance has adopted basic principles essen ? tially in accord with the Workers ' Bill . This spread of support to include workers of various political convictions and in all occupations is likely to extend further as other measures prove disappointing in their limitations . A widespread people 's movement seems likely to develop over the bill . Already a call has been issued for a National Congress for Unemployment and Social Insurance to be held in Washington , January 5 , 6 and 7 . While opening the Congress to consid ? eration of other bills , the call embodies the basic principles expressed in the Workers ' Bill . It is the economic crisis that has brought this metamorphosis in the basic concept of social insur ? ance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands by the unemployed . EWA ? tially the demand is for a periodic redistribution of national income in proportion to the extent of un ? employment at a given time , diverting funds from higher incomes to workers ' purchases . It does not call for a change ha the economic system , but it certainly sets up a challenge to its power to protect the general welfare against the hazards of inse curity . . HE SIGNS his name P. L. Bergoff and does not like to tell you his first name because his first name is Pearl and he thinks it is a hell of a name for any man to have . It makes him sound like a sissy and the business he is in is not a sissy business but all you have to do is to look at him to know that if anybody thinks he is a sissy that person is making a big mistake . He is short and chunky and was n't a bull for nothing and when you look at him you know he is a very tough little guy indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is powdered with freckles and if you saw him com ? ing toward you with one of the baseball bats he supplies his guards when they are out breaking a strike you could not be called a coward if you started running the other way . A little while back he called his business the Berg-off Detective Agency but now he calls it the Bergoff Service Bureau . His business is breaking strikes . He is the Number One strike-breaker in the United States and he is very proud of the fact that he has broken some of the biggest strikes in the country . He is a big business man , with an organization that spreads from Maine to California , and he dresses like a business man but he does not look like one . He always looks like a little tough guy who would he more at home in a fighter 's dressing-room at the Garden than at his desk in his offices on Fifth Ave ? nue . When he talks his mouth goes up at one corner and what he says is worth listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other man in the United States , " he says . " I 've had 10 , ? 000 men on my payrolls . Some of the biggest men in the country have come to me for help . " He is very proud when he says it , and his big diamond ring sparkles with the pleased gesture of his hand , but he is not just talking big and blowing off . What he says is true . In 1920 , for instance , the Erie Railroad called on him to break the strike of its shopmen . He supplied the Erie with some 6,000 men and was paid around $2,000,000 for the job . In 1916 he was hired by Theodore Shonts , president of the Interborough Rapid Transit in New York , to break the subway strike . The take on that job was $1,000,000 and he says it was worth every cent of it . These are but two of his many clients . Among the others have been the B.M.T. , the Postal Telegraph Company , the Chi ? cago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he also says with pride , the people he worked for were very pleased ... and , in substantiation of their pleasure , he produces documentary evidence . This evidence , in the form of a hundred or so letters from satisfied customers , is kept in a little black book . The little tough guy handles it with a reverence you would not expect him to show . Here is his life 's work ? the testament of his service to humanity . He turns the letters , thumbed and worn with fingering , tenderly and gently , with the air of a man reliving his past . Occasionally he stops to read one of them . . . a paragraph of thanks , a phrase of gratitude . " All these are big men , " he says , " the biggest men in the country . You 've got to deliver the goods to get letters like these . Here ... listen to this . And here 's something else . It 's a letter from Senator Edward I. Edwards of New Jersey . Look , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So it is . At the top of the page is the seal of the United States and at the bottom is Senator Edwards ' own signature . It is a letter of recommendation from one of the Senator 's friends . It introduces the little tough guy by name and then it says : " I believe him to be thoroughly able , finally , to carry out any contract into which he would enter . He is a man of considerable means and I believe he is thoroughly dependable. "
