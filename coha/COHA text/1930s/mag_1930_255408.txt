Zane Grey , wild west novelist , owns a large ranch on the rim of Arizona 's Tonto Basin . On his ranch he had fat pigs . Last year Novelist Grey discovered that roving bears were hugging many of his delectable pigs to death . Since it was two weeks before the regular bear season opened , he wired the State game warden for special permission to do a little shooting . The warden refused . Later , although Novelist Grey pays taxes on two pieces of Arizona property , the warden would not issue to him a resident hunting license . <P> Last fortnight , after having thought the matter over for a year , Novelist Grey decided that he had been insulted by this refusal , so grossly insulted that he would never go back to Arizona again . He said he would not even write any more of his famed Arizona stories ( Under the Tonto Rim , Roping Lions in the Grand Canyon , etc . ) . He charged neighboring hunters with spreading untrue , derogatory tales about his sportsmanship . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game has been five bears , three bucks and a few turkeys . I have written 15 novels with Arizona background . Personally it cost me $30,000 to get material for one book alone-To the Last Man . My many trips all over the State have cost me $100,000 . So in every way I have not been exactly an undesirable visitor . Nevertheless I have been grossly insulted . . . lied about . . . and otherwise alienated . This has hurt me so it has taken me a year to speak of it . ... But this is not the only reason I shall not write any more about Arizona . . . . The Game Commission and the Forest Service have gone over to the commercial interests . . . . The Grand Canyon on the North Rim is a tin-can gasoline joint and the hunting season is a shambles .
