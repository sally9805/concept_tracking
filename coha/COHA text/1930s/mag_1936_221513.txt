Before Prohibition , for somewhat similar reasons , both distilleries and schoolhouses closed down in summer . Most whiskey , like most learning , was produced in winter , left to mellow through the hot weather. * Distillers counted whiskey 's maturity in summers because they thought that season gave whiskey its best bouquet . Last week this old-time cycle came back into the liquor business for the first time since Repeal . National Distillers , No. 1 U. S. whiskey producer , announced that seven of its nine distilleries had been shut down until October . With heated warehouses , National 's decision had nothing to do with summer 's effect on whiskey 's flavor . Reason given was that National plants , after running continuously since Repeal , needed overhauling and replacements . Plain fact was that National , like the rest of the industry , feared overproduction . <P> In the liquor business , overproduction really means not just overproduction but more overproduction than seems advisable . From Repeal to June 30 , 1934 , total U. S. production of whiskey was 62,352,666 proof gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1935 , production was 149,112,923 gal. , consumption 50,780,940 gal . In the six months ending December 31 , 1935 , production was 96,363,859 , consumption 36,242,929 . Any other industry which deliberately produced three times as much as it sold-and went on doing it for two and a half years-would be a business madhouse . But after Repeal the new generation of liquor makers had to build up stocks where no stocks existed . While battling for the market with cheap whiskies and blends , they stored away much of their output for aging , kept their eyes on the day-around 1939-when they would have enough good bonded whiskey saved up to offer at low prices . Entering the field at Repeal with more than half the liquor then available in the U. S. , National Distillers kept a long lead in whiskey stocks , had 43,000,000 gal . of whiskey aging in its warehouses last Jan. 1 . In volume of business , however , National 's lead has been taken away by aggressive Schenley Distillers whose 1935 sales were $63,000,000 compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction has lately grown that whiskey 's necessary overproduction has reached its limit . With an all-time record output of 22,000,000 gal . in May , U. S. whiskey stocks for the first time mounted above the pre-Prohibition peak to a total of 281,208,000 gal . At the same time , withdrawals of whiskey for consumption declined 5,390,000 gal . in April to 4,760,000 gal . in May . At this rate , total whiskey reserves at the end of 1936 might be as high as 380,000,000 gal . <P> * Whiskey sales , as well as production , have always slumped in the hot months , gin sales traditionally rising . To improve whiskey 's standing as a summer drink , Calvert Distilling Co. last winter dispatched an expedition to the Amazon ( " Green Hell of Guiana " for advertising purposes ) , equipped with " dermatherms " and plenty of Calvert whiskey . After sitting around in the jungle drinking Calvert for six weeks the expedition returned with figures showing that skin temperatures were to 1 lower after " ingestion " of the whiskey .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
