When it met in Atlantic City , N. J. last fortnight , the Eastern Conference of the Methodist Protestant Church had only one big item on its agenda : to declare itself legally dead . The M. P. Church , split off from ordinary Methodism for 111 years because of doctrinal disputes and a rooted antipathy to bishops , had rejoined it last spring , thus helped to form the nation 's biggest Protestant sect , the new Methodist Church ( TIME , May 8 ) . For 16 M. P. churchmen from southern New Jersey , this merger was newfangled and nefarious . For the record , one of them asked the conference whether it " is still the Methodist Protestant conference , or is it now a Methodist conference ? " Informed that it was the latter , the 16 arose , marched out of the room singing Blessed Assurance , whose chorus goes : This is my story , this is my song , praising my Saviour all the day long . <P> The 16 dissenters forthwith rumped themselves , declared the rump a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning bishops , they issued a statement accusing Methodist Church leaders of denying the Virgin Birth and inspiration of the Scriptures , of espousing " modernism , radicalism and communism . " The ranks of the dissident M. P.s shortly swelled to 37 ministers and congregations . And they had the small but strengthening assurance that M. P.s elsewhere had done what they were doing : in Mississippi , 47 ministers bolted the Methodist Church ; in Michigan , 18 ; in Georgia and South Carolina , a handful . <P> Last week Dr. Ernest Gladstone Richardson , new Methodist Bishop of New Jersey , appointed new pastors to 35 of the 37 " vacant " M. P. pulpits . He pronounced the experience " most trying . " For on Sunday the 37 diehards , backed by their bristling flocks , took their stand for Methodist Protestantism , made ready to repel invaders . This they accomplished peacefully , however . In most of the churches , new pastors courteously claimed the pulpits , were courteously refused , departed quietly-or even remained to hear a diehard 's sermon .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
