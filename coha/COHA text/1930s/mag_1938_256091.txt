Last week Neville Chamberlain returned from his Scottish salmon-fishing trip . The fishing had been poor but London toy-shops sprouted timely little booted Neville Chamberlain dolls holding a rod &; reel in one hand , a little sign saying PEACE MAKER in the other . <P> The London affiliate of the Gallup poll found opinion in the British Isles 57% " satisfied " with the Chamberlain foreign policy . Simultaneously U. S. citizens were Galluped in the same direction , favored the Prime Minister by 59% , although only 30% thought the Chamberlain " peace " permanent . <P> Digesting these signs and portents , the Prime Minister convened his Cabinet- with two vacancies-and began to chart the Speech from the Throne to be delivered November 8 . This is the annual state-of-the-nation speech of His Majesty 's Government , and since His Majesty 's Government have vital interests in every part of the world , it behooved Mr. Chamberlain to look about him far &; wide . <P> From Berlin arrived Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson , who sat for Britain on the Commission of Ambassadors which settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best he could say was that whereas at Godesberg the Fhrer demanded 12,000 square miles of Czechoslovak territory , Germany has now received a grand total of only 10,885 square miles . More heartening was word that Germany would like to cut in with Britain on the forthcoming U. S.-British trade agreement . Germany would take what U. S. and Dominions raw materials Britain could not absorb , pay the British for it with German machinery , chemicals , optical goods . <P> From Paris came Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps to report on significant developments in France . Ever since France embarked upon a " New Deal " policy under Leon Blum ( TIME , June 15 , 1936 et seq. ) , the Conservative British Cabinet have assisted French moderates like Premier Edouard Daladier in their efforts to bring France back from the Left to the Centre . <P> When the French Chamber , directly after M. Daladier returned from Munich , voted him decree powers running until November 15 , this reversal began in earnest and by last week there was plenty for Sir Eric to report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 40-Hour-Week Law in " industries vital to national safety . " He has broken with the Communist Party , formerly a pillar of the French Popular Front coalition , to the delight of Berlin . And Premier Daladier has recognized the Italian conquest in Ethiopia by appointing Andre Frangois-Poncet to Rome as the first French Ambassador ever accredited to " Emperor Vittorio Emanuele . " All this meant that France had been scared into swerving Right . <P> Britain , too , was busy courting the dictator powers , to the approval of U. S. Ambassador Kennedy . It was significant that King George &; Queen Elizabeth lunched the Italian Crown Princess at Buckingham Palace last week-something which would have been unthinkable before the Big Four got together at Munich . <P> This week Britain 's attention shifted to far-off China where Japanese bombers attacked the tiny British river gunboat.
