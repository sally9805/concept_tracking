Biggest professional organization in the U. S. is the National Education Association , which numbers some 225,000 ( four-fifths women ) of the nation 's 1,000,000 school teachers . But teachers , who in many communities are expected to be politically as well as physically chaste , seldom raise their voices outside the classroom . Consequently they are perennially startled at the bold talk that springs up at the N. E. A. 's annual conventions , attended chiefly by the outspoken fringe . <P> Last week the 1,680 delegates and 12,000 visitors who arrived in Manhattan for the 76th N. E. A. convention and incidental sight-seeing were embarrassed by even bolder talk than usual . Before the meeting began , a teacher tossed a firecracker at the American Legion ( see col. 2 ) . At an opening session , New York University 's short , blunt Professor Alonzo Franklin Myers proposed that U. S. teachers discuss with their pupils , as study materials on dictatorship , the recent testimony of Jersey City 's Mayor Frank Hague on suppressing opponents ' speeches . Wriggling under such naming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable ( though some cheered ) when Professor Goodwin Watson , of Columbia 's Teachers College , praised the cooperative achievements of Soviet Russia and sneered at New York City 's World 's Fair as " ballyhoo for business , a coming to gigantic life of the advertisements in the expensive magazines . " <P> By week 's end the teachers had watched a host of speakers shake scolding fingers at foreign dictatorships , had heard themselves nominated for the job of immunizing the nation against emotional propaganda . Thereupon the delegates adopted a resolution urging the President and Congress to " work intelligently , cooperatively and unselfishly for world peace . " <P> The convention also : <P> Elected big , sandy-haired Reuben Taylor Shaw , a Philadelphia high-school teacher , as its president . <P> Listened to a pronunciation bee in which ten teachers took part and everybody flunked . Words flunked : dioceses , cantatrice , Nabuchodonosor , a fortiori , conchoidal . <P> Heard a remarkable report on experiments that proved intelligence is affected by environment . Psychologist George Dinsmore Stoddard , director of the Child Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) illegitimate children of feeble-minded mothers and laboring fathers , after being placed in good homes , turned out to be bright children ; 2 ) apparently normal youngsters , kept in an overcrowded orphanage , " deteriorated . " <P> Awarded its highest honor ( life membership in the N. E. A. ) to 19-year-old Virginia Sappington , a $70-a-month teacher in Piety Hill School , near Chetopa , Kans. , who last March herded 21 children into a ditch and saved their lives before a tornado made splinters of the school building . <P> But the N. E. A. was not yet ready to adjourn . Out it marched to the World 's Fair , busily abuilding , made an honorary life member of onetime Teacher Eleanor Roosevelt . Presiding over the convention 's final meeting , Mrs. Roosevelt introduced the main speaker . Said she : " It is the privilege of a presiding officer to make a speech . I will not avail myself of that privilege . May I present the President of the United States . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
