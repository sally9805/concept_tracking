Rheumy-eyed Prince Saionji , the tottering Last of the Genro ( Elder Statesmen ) again had to rack his withered old brains last week . He and the Sublime Emperor faced another assault by Japan 's big navy jingoes . Some 60 officers of the Imperial fleet , all potent sea dogs with the rank of captain or higher , had just laid reverently but firmly before the Throne a petition dangerous as dynamite . They asked the Son of Heaven to tear up in his infinite wisdom the chief naval treaties to which Japan is a party and to demand naval equality for her with the U. S. and Great Britain . Though addressed to His Majesty , the sea dogs ' demands were really aimed at the Premier , a sea dog himself . Admiral Viscount Makoto Saito . He promptly invoked a convenient fiscal scandal ( the Vice Minister of Finance had been in jail on charges of bribery since mid-May ) and the entire Cabinet resigned , leaving everything in the lap of 85-year-old Prince Saionji . <P> Normally the leader of the Seiyukai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament , should have been asked to form a cabinet last week , but Japanese politics have been decidedly abnormal ever since naval petty officers assassinated her last civilian premier , the Hon. Ki ( " Old Fox " ) Inukai two years ago ( TIME , May 23 , 1932 ) . This crime and other " purifying assassinations , " all supposedly performed by patriots , are considered to have put corrupt politicians " on probation " - with no prospect of getting the Government out of the hands of the military for the present . Thus last week Premier Saionji had to advise the Emperor to choose another fighting service premier , another admiral or general . Courageously the Last of the Genro advised and the Son of Heaven appointed as Premier about the least quarrelsome sea dog to be found in the Imperial Navy , Admiral Keisuke Okada , retired . <P> As his first official act last week Admiral Okada ordered opened up in the Premier 's Official Residence the room in which " Old Fox " Inukai was done to death . Furnished in Japanese style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may squat as their forefathers did . Since the assassination squatting has been taboo , with Premier Saito using chairs and tables in the new style rooms of the Official Residence . Last week Premier Okada went enthusiastically back to squatting . He called back to their portfolios the outstanding members of the Saito Cabinet except famed Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi in whose department the bribe scandal had occurred . By no means in disgrace , venerable Mr. Takahashi was able to slip in as the new Finance Minister his devoted henchman Mr. Sadanobu Fujii.
