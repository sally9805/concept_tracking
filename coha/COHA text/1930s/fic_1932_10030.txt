advantage of his clearer vision , he was beginning to regret the opportunities he had missed in the past as well as those he would have to forgo in the future . The situation was nothing less than tragic . Life owed him many unclaimed women . The reprehensible blood of the elder Van Dyck throbbed rebelliously in his veins . " Miss Bryant , " he said , protecting sections of his features behind a letter , " I wish you would toss on your hat and buy half a dozen pair of stockings at one of the smarter shops in the district . Would you mind ? " Miss Bryant certainly would not mind . She would be glad to go to even greater lengths for Mr. Peter Van Dyck . She would , however , have been interested to know what clearly impure motives lay behind this unexpected request . From the little she could see of Peter 's features she was convinced they did not belong to a thoroughly honest face . " Have you any particular shade in mind , sir ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Peter . " Er  --  oh , yes , of course . Naturally . " He laughed for no reason . " Flesh , " he announced , coloring slightly . " I mean all shades . You know . All the fashionable shades . Youthful . They 're for my Aunt Sophie . She has rather silly ideas  --  ambitions , one might say . " " Oh , " said Miss Bryant . " So they 're for your aunt . " " Yes , " retorted Peter . " I said they were for my aunt . Why ? Is it funny ? " " No . Oh , no . Not at all . I was wondering what size stockingyour Aunt Sophie wears , that 's all . " " Any size I give her , " replied Peter , striving to maintain a casual note in his voice . " I should say about the same size as that Josephine Duval or any other girl her size . " " I think I understand , " said Miss Bryant thoughtfully . " I was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the young lady several crisp notes . " And while you 're about it , treat your own legs to a pair on the house , " P51he added . " Fine feathers make fine birds , you know . Ha , ha ! Capital ! " With her employer 's false laughter ringing in her ears , Miss Bryant departed , wondering why she had never suspectedhim before of being mentally unsteady . These old families got that way in spots . Too bad . When she had successfully fulfilled her mission and deliveredthe stockings to Peter , he summoned his secretary . Although she had flatly announced her intention of never entering his office again , Josephine Duval appeared almost immediately . " What improper suggestions have you been making to that Bryant thing ? " she demanded . " She 's gone light in the head all of a sudden . " " I know nothing about that , " said Peter . " She struck me as being an uncommonly sensible and willing young lady . " " Willing , no doubt , " snapped Josephine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of that laugh , " said Peter , " as well as the coarse implications behind it . Here are half a dozen pairs of stockings  --  pure silk stockings  --  all silk stockings , in fact . Yank a couple of them over your legs and let 's hear no more on the subject . This has been a fruitless day , and it 's not going to get any better . " Josephine took the extended package and tore off its wrappings . For a moment there was silence in the office as she examined the contents with an experienced and rapidly calculating eye . Presently she turned and looked darkly at Peter Van Dyck . " And for this , " she said , " I suppose you expect to own me body and soul . " " I 'm not interested in your soul , " Peter informed her curtly . " Oh , " said Josephine , momentarily nonplussed . " All right . It 's a bargain . We 'll let it go at a body . "  | " I have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied uneasily , " but I strongly advise you to hold everything . And please get it into your head that I have no desire to own either your body or your soul . " " How about a little loan ? " Josephine suggested . " Will you now go away and stop talking wildly , " said Peter . " After all , I am your employer . You 're supposed to be working here , you know , and not paying me little visits throughout the day . " Josephine looked at him furiously . " You 're going to own my body , " she said between her teeth , " if I have to ruin yours in the struggle . " " An edifying picture , " Peter dryly observed . " However , I shall keep on the alert . " " If they were n't pure silk I 'd cut these stockings to ribbons . " " Glad you like them , " said Peter mildly . " If I were you , I would n't carry them about with me in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em down here , " she declared , thrusting the six pairs of stockings down the front of her dress , where they produced an interesting , not to say scandalous effect . " If you go out there in that condition , " observed Peter , " people will do more than talk . They 'll swoon in your face . Even I , in full possession of all the facts , can not suppress a pang of uneasiness . " " You 're responsible for my condition , " she flung back . " Granted , " replied Peter reasonably . " But I 'm not responsiblefor what others might erroneously conclude wasyour condition . " " Anyway , here I go , " said Josephine . " We have a secret between us now . " " It looks as if we have a great deal more than that , " Peter replied  | " Nobody will notice anything if I go like this , " the girl explained , placing her hands across her stomach . " Oh , no , " agreed Peter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of playfulness , that 's all . Please hurry . It upsets me to look at you the way you are . " At the door Jo turned and glanced back at him . " You ca n't tell me , " she said , " you did n't have something else in your mind when you gave me these . " The door closed behind her , and Peter leaned back in his chair . He was wondering himself exactly what he had in his mind in regard to Jo Duval . Time passed while Peter sat thus steadily accomplishing nothing . He had contributed very little to the success of the Van Dyck coffee business that day . Presently he stirred and reached for his watch . After thoughtfully considering the time of day it announced , he compared it with the clock on his desk . To make assurance doubly sure , he rose and , opening the door , glanced at the office clock . As he closed the door he got the impression that Betty Bryant was studying him with new interest . Perhaps there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , he stood looking down on the narrow street . People were already turning their released expressions homeward . They were looking forward to a few hours of personal living , a few hours of individual freedom . Five p. m. was for them a daily declaration of temporary independence . Not so for him . He had to go home presently and let that damn cat out of the bag . He would much rather wring its neck . Was he not voluntarily thrusting his own neck into a noose for life ? It was still not too late . Why not take a ferryboat to Staten Island and live among the trees somewhere ? Why not cross a bridge and lose himself in a swarm of unfamiliar streets ? Why not scuttle through a tubee nd seek oblivion in a waterfront speakeasy ? There were anyn umber of things he could do . As he stood there by the win- dow , he became uneasily aware of the fog drifting through the street . Figures of men and women were cutting through it , zigzagging past one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side streets . Boys were whistling . Boys always were . Why ? Why were they always whistling ? From two rivers came the haunting voices of ships  --  tugs , liners , ferryboats , yachts going up to pleasant moorings . Foggy as hell somewhere . What sort of mooring was he going up to ? An anchorage for life . Maybe something would happen . Lots of things could happen in a fog . He turned from the window , walked slowly to the hatrack , and collected his hat and stick . As he bade his office staff good-night , he felt he was saying good-bye . Josephine Duval had already gone . The subway crowd was familiar , but not friendly . It was composed of individuals , each having tenaciously held ideas about his or her place on the platform . They knew where they wanted to go and how they wanted to go there , and nothing was going to stop them or change them or soften them . Looking slightly pained , Peter Van Dyck , with a delicate but nevertheless protesting arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train in which he stood tightly wedged , suffering from a loss of both dignity and breath . He decided he was lucky to lose no more than that in such a frenzied stampede . " If you do n't stop doing that to me , " said a woman 's voice somewhere in the neighborhood of his chest , " I 'll slap you in the face . " Peter 's first reaction was to glance nervously about him to ascertain if the entire car had overheard the woman 's intentions . Then he spoke in a low , reassuring voice in which was a note of appeal . " I 'm not doing it , " he whispered . " Do n't tell me that , " said the woman . " Ca n't I feel ? There you go , doing it again . You 're getting a lot for a nickel ride , mister . "  | " My God , " thought Peter , striving unsuccessfully to removehimself from the woman , " what a thing for her to say ! " Crouching over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madam , I ca n't help it . I 'm " Do you mean you 've lost control of yourself ? " the woman 's voice cut in . " No , " he protested . " I ca n't think of what I 'm doing . " " I do n't like to think of what you are doing , " the woman continued . " Lay off , that 's all . Do you want me to scream for help ? " Straining his neck down and to the side , Peter succeeded in getting a glimpse of his accuser . It was as he had been suspecting for the past few moments . She was there  --  Jo . Peter did not know whether to be relieved by this or alarmed . " Do n't go on like that , " he pleaded . " Do n't you go on like that , " she told him . " Should be ashamed of yourself . Of all the things to do . " " But what in God 's name am I doing ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be even more embarrassingthan to submit to it , " she told him with elaborate dignity . " It ca n't be as bad as all that , " he said . " I 'd hate it to get any worse , " she replied , " at least with so much public about , I would . " " It is too close for decency , " agreed Peter . " You seem to find it so , " she retorted . " Suppose they knew at the office ? " " Knew what ? " " Never mind about what . You know perfectly well . I hate that sort of thing  --  that type of man . " " So do I , " replied Peter earnestly . " The very idea is revolting to me . " " ' Then obviously , you do n't believe in letting your left hand know what your right hand is doing , " she retorted.  | " Both of my hands are busy , " he declared . " Do n't I know that ? " said Jo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allowed to travel in the subwayduring rush hours . " " What did you do with the stockings ? " he asked her , hopingto change the subject . " You could n't get closer to them unless you put them on , " she assured him . " Then they 're still in the same place ? " " Either there or hanging on my backbone . " " How ghastly ! " " It 's your fault if they are , " she replied . " Do you still intend to go through that mock engagement announce-ment ? " " Why not ? " demanded Peter . " Should n't think you 'd have the nerve after this ride . " " Do n't be silly . " " I 'm not being silly when I tell you , " she replied quite seriously , " that I doubt very much if you get yourself engagedtoday . " Peter glanced quickly down into her upturned face . In her eyes he read an expression of grim determination . For some reason her portentous threat or warning did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter received it almost with a feeling of relief . In fact , he found in her words a fragile straw of salvation . If it would have served to delay the formal betrothal announcement , Peter would have welcomeda localized earthquake . So far as his engagement to Yolanda was concerned , he found himself strictly neutral . He was on the fence . It was not as if he wanted to call the engagement off definitely and forever . Peter simply did not know . Why had they not gone through with it several years ago , instead of waiting until the idea had grown stale ? No . Yolanda had wanted to travel on the Continent unattached.  |p57She  had wanted to develop her art . She had wanted to enjoy her position as a much sought after debutante . She was one of those young ladies who wanted Life with a capital L , yet who would not know what to do with it should it come to her . She had wanted ever so many things and she had got all of them . And in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting capacity safely packed in ice . She was such a glittering , assured sort of person , so certain to be right , so well versed in all the social amenities . She would be quite a comfort when people called , as they inevitably would call , in droves  --  dumb , well-dressed , well-nourished , chatty little droves of really nice people . Peter wondered unhappily in his increasing morbidness what they were going to do with all the people who called . Where were they going to put them ? How deal with them ? The years ahead presented themselves to Peter as pillars in an endless hall lined with nice people who shook hands and chatted delightfully about non-essentials . And all the while he was puzzling over these things , Jo was looking up into his troubled , rather sensitive face from beneath the heavy lashes of her amused but devoted eyes . " Hang it all , " he said at last , " why do you like me , anyway ? I should think you 'd fall for a truck driver or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those great big silent chaps who make the maximum amount of empire tin the minimum amount of words . The movies are full of them . Look at me  --  I 'm virtually a physical and mental wreck . Might just as well be an idiot . I catch cold almost always , my nose gets red in the winter and even worse insummer  --  frost and sunburn vie for honors  --  I probablyore enormously and , as you know for yourself , I do n't even know how many pairs of drawers I 'm wearing half the time , ' Whereas during the other half I daresay I 'm not wearing any drawers at all . I 'm quite impossible any way you look at It . "  | " I realize all that , " she said , " but I bet you know a lot of dirty stories , and I fairly wallow in those . " Peter groaned spiritually . This creature was beyond belief  --  literally incredible . And to think that he had been in the same office with her for three whole years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same demoralizing influence . Perhaps that accounted for the old gentleman 's perennial bloomings . " Furthermore , " the girl 's voice continued , " professional wrestlers and strong men and those silent birds you mentionedare notoriously moral . They hold deep-rooted convictionsand have exceedingly piggish ways . Now you  --  you 're quite another proposition . Without realizing it you are so morally flexible that you must have been born corrupted . I 'd much rather live amid physical ruins than stagnate amid moral perfection . " " Your sentiments and opinions do us both credit , I 'm sure , " observed Peter Van Dyck . " What sort of life are you planning for me to live with you  --  one of pillage , rape , and arson ? " " Pillage and arson , perhaps , " she said briefly . " The other will not be necessary . " " Are n't you getting off soon ? " asked Peter . " Yes , " she replied as the train lurched into Times Square . " Right here . Good-bye , for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm on your side . " Peter 's gaze followed her through the door of the train and out onto the platform . As she looked back at him Josephine decided she had never seen a more lost and miserableexpression in any man 's eyes . Being of a primitive nature , she still had room for pity . Her scheme for helping this man and at the same time helping herself crystallized there in her mind as Peter 's train drew out . Tossing herp59shopping expedition to the winds , she boarded the next uptownexpress . On her way to 72nd Street she revolved many desperate remedies in her mind . At the same time she found occasion to congratulate herself for having come to a decision while still in the subway , for thus she had saved the price of anotherfare . Jo was passionate about everything  --  even thrift.  |p60Little  Arthur in Quest of DrawersLITTLE ARTHUR 'S AGGRIEVED MEDITATIONS ON THE GREATERadvantages enjoyed by second-story men in providing themselves with the drawers of others had led him far afield . As a result of these meditations he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the professional limits of his calling . Having established the fact that Central Park was virtually barren of loot of the smaller species , he found himself this afternoon wandering watchfullythrough the streets of the West 70 's , his disarmingly mild blue eyes constantly on the alert for a convenient house to second-story . Once he had selected a suitable subject for his nefarious project , he had certain ideas of his own in regard to carrying it to a successful conclusion . After tentatively weighing the pros and cons of an areawaythat impressed his sensitive nature with its unmistakable air of good breeding , Little Arthur proceeded down it until it eventually terminated in Martha , one of the trimmest of the Van Dyck maids . The kitchen being unchaperoned at t lie moment , Little Arthur with his usual subtleness prevailed upon Martha to invite him in for a cup of tea . He achieved this by convincing the guileless maid that in him she was beholdingnot merely one of the offshoots but absolutely the very flower itself of depression . Presently , seated at the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were bending their heads prettily over the tepidly glowing allurements of a spurious ruby ring . " Would n't be a bit surprised , " Little Arthur admitted softly , " if that gem had n't belonged in its time to one of them far-Indian potentates . " " No ! " exclaimed young Martha . " You do n't mean ter jay ? One of them redskins like ? " " I low should I know , " put in Little Arthur , " not ever tightly having seen the color of this here potentate 's skin ? May have been red . May have been brown . May have been as White as the back of me hand . " The back of Little Arthur 's hand somewhat spoiled the effect of this ill-chosen comparison . " That far-Indian potentate would n't have been so white ,  |p62at  that , " remarked the maid , Martha , prompted no doubt by that nasty streak which lies ever close to the surface in all members of her sex . Little Arthur delicately removed his hand from the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the hand of an honest man , at any rate , " said he with a note of bitterness . " Mean ter say this old potentate 's hands were n't strictly honest ? " Martha 's large gray eyes grew larger and a little frightened . " I keep telling you I never met this here far-Indian potentate , " Little Arthur protested , amazed by the hopeless irrelevance of the feminine mind . " But you know how them potentates arc . " " No , " the girl admitted quite frankly . " I do n't know much about potentates . How are they , now ? " " Well , " replied Little Arthur , heartily wishing he had never brought up the subject , " you ca n't quite say how they are . They sort of take things when they fancy ' em  --  like women and gold and jewels . " " Maybe this jewel belonged to one of this potentate 's women , " said Martha in an awed voice . " Think of it ! This jewel being on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need to wear much more than that . " Little Arthur embodied his disapproval of the trend of the girl 's remarks in a slightly offended cough . " I hope , " he replied , " that the lady who wore that ring was a step above a harem hussy . " " What 's a harem really like , mister ? " Martha asked him wistfully . " I 've often wanted ter know . " A gentle pink was finding its way into Little Arthur 's ears . The conversation was becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain . Once more he endeavored to signify his disapproval through the medium of an especially refined cough.  | " Should n't think you 'd want to fill your head with a lot of truck like that , " he observed with some severity . " But I do , mister , " pleaded the maid . " Go on and tell me . The movies make ' em fine . " Fearing lest refusal might endanger the outcome of his enterprise , Little Arthur compromised with his scruples as have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt . " Well , " he began , " a harem , properly speaking , is sort of like a nursery only for grown-ups , yer understand . It 's a place where you sort of have fun in and lark about . " " I knew you had fun , " admitted Martha innocently , " but I 'd never heard about that nursery part before . Sounds kinda dull . " From beneath eyebrows arched in pain , Little Arthur distastefullyregarded the girl . " It 's like that , " he said shortly . " Dull . Now about this here jewel . I " Always thought I 'd like to join one of them harem places , " Martha interrupted dreamily . " Dancing all day and resting on piles of pillers .. eating fruit and drinking wine and telling great big naked slaves to get a move on with them fans . Flies tickle something fierce when you ai n't d ressed for ' em . " Little Arthur 's eyes were almost bulging from his head . " Just a minute , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his alarming companion . " Let 's get back to this here potentate 's jewel . " He had no intention of allowing the situation to developy further along its present lines . He had insinuated himIfinto the good graces of this girl with a definite objectIn view . He had staked his professional reputation to prorewhat he firmly believed to be the most personal articlea gentleman 's attire . It was far beyond the scope of hisOperations to jeopardize the integrity of his own in so doing . To victimize the maid was one thing . To become her victim was quite another . He would leave that sort of conduct to his betters . " All right , mister , " said the girl . " What about that jewel ? " " Now you 're talking , " replied the little man , allowing a note of approval to rob his voice of its former austerity . " I 'll let this jewel go for less than nothing because of the tea and all . " " And how much is that in money ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he confided . " And I should be shot for doing it . " Not for a moment suspecting how thoroughly the artful little man deserved to be shot , Martha rose from the table . " All right , mister , " she announced . " I 'll run upstairs and get my purse . " " Where 's that ? " he demanded . " Servants ' quarters , " she told him . " Top floor . " This suited Arthur 's plans to perfection . " Do n't be long , " he warned her as she turned to the servicestairway . The moment the sound of her tripping feet had died away in the upper regions of the house , Little Arthur deposited the ring on the table and silently hastened up the stairs . Attainingthe second floor with a thrill of elation , he crept up to the nearest door and listened . Then , like a half-starved shadow , he faded noislessly into the room . It was a large , pleasant room  --  a man 's room , he was quick to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossing swiftly to one of these , he looked out to ascertain the easiest means of exit . There was no easiest means of exit . It was a sheer drop to the street from every window . At that moment he heard the knob of the door turning . Little Arthur could not recall ever having listened to a more unwanted sound . Ducking round a table laden with bottles and a siphon , hep65secreted his small person with the deftness of desperation behindone of the portieres . To have been released from his present predicament , not only would he have willingly sacrificed his prospects of ever obtaining the drawers of others but also tossed his own into the bargain as a gesture of good will . Peter Van Dyck , ruffled by the world in general and the subway in particular , slowly entered the room . Little Arthur , catching a furtive glimpse of his expression , decided that here indeed was a man who would regard none too favorably any slight familiarity from a member of the criminal class . Why had he , Little Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so long and well ? Why had he allowed shallow frivolity to cloud and confound his discretion ? All the drawers in all the world were not worth the anxiety he was experiencing there behind that curtain . Suddenly the small , unhappy man caught his breath . Good God ! What next ? The owner of the room was actually undressing . Could he be going to bed at this hour ? What a glutton for sleep ! But some men were like that , only they seldom stopped to undress . It was shoes and all with them . Suppose this chap took it into his head to sit up and read ? 1 lc himself was given to that small relaxation after a difficult day . He might be forced to remain concealed until he fainted from sheer exhaustion . Little Arthur was becoming panicstricken . While this scene was working up to its inevitable climax , Josephine Duval was resolutely ascending the front stoop of the Van Dyck residence . Just what she intended to do when she got inside , she had not the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most successful opportunists . Somethingwould be sure to turn up . Something always did . Buthat turned up at first was not any too reassuring . This was . less a personage than Sanders , the Van Dyck butler . " Would you mind telling your mistress , " said Jo , neatly slipping past the great man , " that there 's a lady calling on her who is in an interesting condition ? " Now this form of announcing herself , especially in view of the fact that it was entirely misleading if not worse , might strike some as being particularly ill-advised . However , Jo found herself in the position of one suddenly called upon to speak when there is absolutely nothing to say , and so she very wisely decided that it really did not matter much what she said so long as she said something  --  anything . Furthermoreit can not be denied that her opening speech was not without an element of surprise . Even the impeccable Sanders found the information difficult to take in his stately stride . " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note off key . " Has my mistress any special reason to be interested in your interesting condition , may I ask ? " " No , " snapped Jo , " but her nephew has . And while we 're on the subject you might as well know that I 'm not a madam yet . I 'm still a miss , if in name only . And you 'd better carry on with a click . My condition grows more interesting by leaps and bounds . Soon it may become engrossing . " Sanders had encountered many extraordinary young women in the course of a long and inactive career but never one quite so buoyantly extraordinary as Josephine . She impressedthe astonished butler as being actually exuberant over a situation which any properly constituted girl would have considered , if not desperate , at least disturbing . " I quite understand , miss , " he replied soothingly . " If you 'll pardon me a moment I 'll withdraw to consult  --  2 ' " And if I 'm not here when you get back , " Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nearest river  --  which one is that ? " " The Hudson , miss , " said Sanders hopefully . " About three blocks over to your left as you go out . " " You 're almost too eagerly explicit , " Josephine observed as the butler turned a dignified back and departed.  |p67As  soon as he had gone , Josephine looked quickly about her . From a room opening off the hall about ten feet away came the hum of conversation . Also the sound of clinking glasses . The cocktail-tea party was already getting under way . Josephine was greatly interested . She yearned to see everything  --  how these people lived and what they intended to do to Peter , who by now had become in her illogical mind irrevocably her man . Regardless of the laws of decency and self-respect , she must prevent this engagement . The door to what appeared to be a clothes closet presented itself as the most obvious means to this end . As she slipped into this closet and closed the door behind her , she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal announcement of Peter 's betrothal to that snake-hipped Yolanda Wilmont . The closet was fairly commodious , but without light . Innumerable unseen coats were hanging on all sides of the girl  --  fur coats , storm coats , top coats , motor robes , and dusters . Thinking how grandly the rich lived , she disappeared behind the coats and temporarily withdrew from active participation in the destiny of the Van Dycks . Abovestairs , in his room , Peter was wondering if the shower bath he fully intended to take was going to improve matters any . Did condemned men take showers before they faced the firing squad or marched to the chair ? The only condemned man he knew anything about was himself , and what little he knew about him was hardly interesting enough to be told . However , things might be worse . He was not actually getting married today . There was always poison as a last resort . He wondered whether he should take it himself or give it to Yolanda . And while these speculations were passing through Peter 's mind , equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the hall below and looked round for signs of the vanished Jo . Presently he shrugged his shoulders as if to dismiss the incident . Evidently the young lady hadp68decided in favor of the river . Under the circumstances that was probably the most tactful arrangement for all concerned . In spite of her bold manner the young woman must have had some sense of the fitness of things . Had he said the river was three or four blocks over ? He did not quite recall . Too many things to think about . By now she should be quite definitelydrowned if she had not changed her mind . She had seemed like a determined character , if a little callous . There were other things to be done . Cocktails to serve . Sanders moved away , leaving the hall deserted . Several times while undressing , Peter had approached dangerouslyclose to the curtain behind which Little Arthur stood concealed . Altogether too close for the peace of mind of that small pickpocket . Now that his uninvited host was completely naked , there was the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . That was what Little Arthur would have done had he been in the same condition . Maybe the rich were different . Maybe they did not care . If he could only create some diversion , thought the man behind the curtain , some little distraction sufficient to occupy the other 's attention long enough to enable one to get out of that fateful room . What could he do ? Peter had turned and was looking intentlyat the portiere . Had he noticed anything , any slight , betraying movement ? Little Arthur broke out into a gentle sweat . Those eyes  --  those probing eyes . As soon as Peter looked away , the pickpocket 's arm slid from behind the portiere and withdrew with the siphon . Little Arthur had not the vaguest idea what he intended to do with the bottle , but at least it was better than having nothing at all , better than facing with bare hands an infuriated and naked property owner . Once more Peter 's eyes strayed toward the portieres . Why did he look at that one portiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes . He did suspect something . He actually knew something . Once more he was approachingp69the portiere . He was halfway across the room , and naked as a primitive man . Little Arthur was as much unnerved by what he saw as by what he feared . His grip tightened on the object in his hand . Two thirds across the room Peter stopped and , turning his bare back , reached down and meditatively scratched his leg as men will . This was a trick , Little Arthur decided . No man , unless fired by some sinister determination , would permit himself to appear in such an unfavorable light . Furthermore , the rich , if they took advantage of their opportunities , should have no occasion thus to scratch themselves . Little Arthur was not to be deceived . This was a trick . If Peter Van Dyck had been hoping to rattle the small criminal , he had virtually succeeded . To witness these preparationswas even worse than facing the attack itself . It was at this moment that Little Arthur was seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents of the siphon on the exposed back of the busily scratching man . It was an impulse not difficult to understand . Virtually everyone is visited by it at least once in the course of his life . Some persons never outgrow it . To them a siphon and a naked back mean only one thing immediate contact . At the moment Little Arthur had not sufficient mental stamina to resist any impulse . He raised the siphon , drew an accurate bead on the exposed surface , then pressed the lever . The liquid missile splashed smartly against Peter Van Dyck 's back and broke into little cascades along the ridges of his spine . The effect was instantaneous . Peter snapped erect and looked wildly about him . Astonishment , shock , and indignation fought for ascendancy in his eyes . But his gaze encountered nothing enlightening . For a moment he feared for his reason . Was it possible that in his spiritual turmoil he had imagined himself under the shower ? The water trickling down his flanks annoyed but reassured him . Then anger mounted within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense , especially a nude Van Dyck . The perpetrator of this outrage against his privacy and person must be concealed somewhere within the room . Probably behind one of those portieres . Almost slithering with excitement , Peter warily advanced upon one of the hangings . That he had selected the wrong one did not rob his activities of interest . Little Arthur was interested and also a bit relieved . As a matter of fact he was even faintly amused . The idea of a naked man stalking an empty portiere had its lighter side . As Peter , quivering with purpose , sprang upon his portiere , Little Arthur , quivering with no less purpose , sprang from behind his and sprinted to the door . Reaching this before Peter had time to turn , the flying pickpocket dashed out into the hall and slammed the door behind him . The sound of the door brought Peter back to action . Passionately cursingthe portiere , he sped across the room and threw open the door . The intruder was gone , obviously having succeeded in putting the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter was right . Little Arthur , tossing discretionto the winds , had nipped down the first flight of stairs that offered itself to his frantic feet . For a brief moment Peter hesitated in the doorway , then , adding decency to discretion , he tossed them both to the winds and took up the chase . On the landing he ran into Martha . " Gord , Mr. Peter ! " she gasped . " Whacha doing ? " " Running , " said Peter briefly . He had no time for explanations . " I should say , " murmured the maid after his bare back . " Running wild like Adam hisself. "  |p71The  Loquacious ClosetPETER 'S DESCENT INTO THE FRONT HALL FORTUNATELYwent unnoticed . More guests had arrived , and more guests were due to arrive . It was this latter possibility that brought I'ctcr to a full and blinding realization of his position . For the first time he saw himself as indubitably he would appear in the eyes of others . He saw himself not as an innocent man seeking justice , but simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests at the doors of his ancestral home . The picture was somewhat too vivid for his nerves . He delivered the soul of his craven attacker into the arms of divine retribution and flung himself into the clothes closet a split second before Sanders appeared to answer the summons of the doorbell . Reaching out in the darkness , Peter 's hand groped horrifyinglyover a face . Now this is a decidedly disagreeable experience , perhaps one of the most disagreeable in the world . It is especially so when one is under the impression that there are no faces about . Even married people , after long years of propinquity , are frequently revolted when in the still hours of the night they inadvertently extend a hand and find themselvesfumbling drowsily with the face of a mate . The same holds true even of one 's mistress . One receives quite an unpleasant shock . With other parts of the body it is not so bad , but with the face , yes . It was certainly so with Peter . Had it not been for his nakedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was far from well . " Who arc you ? " demanded Peter , his voice hoarse with consternation . " I 'm Little Arthur , " chattered a voice in the darkness . " You know , mister , the guy you was chasing . " If it had not been for the fact that every instinct in Peter 's being cried out against further association with any part of Little Arthur , the man would have been strangled there and then in the blackness of the closet . " Sorry I squirted the water on you , mister , " the little dip began in mollifying accents . " It does n't matter really , " said Peter with false politeness . " I was going to take a shower anyway . May I ask , though , what you were doing in my room ? "  | " I 'm a burglar , " replied Little Arthur , too depressed to be other than truthful . " But I was n't looking for anything valuable . Only a pair of drawers . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And to think that just this morning I had more drawers than I needed  --  more than I could comfortably wear . What are you doing in here , Little Arthur ? " " The same thing as you , sir . Keeping out of the public eye . " A moment 's silence , then Peter 's voice , nervously : " You seem to be in front of me , and yet I distinctly feel you breathingheavily on my back . How do you manage that ? " " I 'm not doing it , mister , " said Little Arthur . " I ai n't got strength enough left to do any breathing at all . " " No ? " replied Peter , turning . " That 's funny . Oh , my God ! I 'm surrounded . " He had thrust one of his fingers into Josephine 's mouth , and she had instinctively bitten it for lack of anything better to do . " Remove your finger from my mouth this instant , " she gabbled furiously . Peter 's hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here with Little Arthur ? " he demanded , nursing his damaged finger . " I had n't thought of doing anything with Little Arthur , " Jo retorted . " Do n't even know what to do with myself much less with anyone else . He must have come in here after me . " " The dirty little crook ! " said Peter . " I 'll strangle him with these two bare hands right here in cold blood . " Little Arthur closed his eyes , yet still saw two bare hands floating through the darkness . " Go on and do it , " urged Josephine . " There are too many of us in this closet already . " " I do n't want to be in here alone with you , " Peter told r . " And the dead body of a criminal , perhaps . "  | " It wo n't make any difference so long as the body is good and dead , " Jo explained . " Oh , what a terrible woman ! " Little Arthur chattered from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't know why you followed her in the first place , " said Peter . " I wo n't ever again , " vowed the little man . " Did n't even know she was here . " " He 's a nasty little liar , " whispered Josephine . " He deliberatelycame in after me . " " Do n't you believe her , mister , " Little Arthur pleaded . " She 's trying to turn you against me just as we were getting along , like . I know her game . " " Shut up , you rat ! " the girl flung at him . " I 'll claw your wicked tongue out . " " Do n't let her at me , please , mister , " Little Arthur put in . " She wants to get us both in trouble . " " We arc in trouble , " Peter reminded him . " Terrible trouble . Suppose someone should come barging into this closet ? " " I 'll swear I was lured in , " said Jo . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , " she answered readily . " Would n't speak well for your morals , " he snapped . " Nor any better for yours , " she replied . " But if you don'tlike that , I 'll say that the two of you dragged me in . " " Would n't put it past her , mister , " warned Little Arthur . " She 's a bad one , she is . Glad I ca n't see her . " " You horrid little crook ! " shrilled Jo . " Where do you get off ? " " I 'll have to ask you both to shut up , " said Peter . " You 'll be having the whole damn house in . " " Oh , dear , " murmured Jo . " Here I am cooped up in a closet with a naked man and a thief . I do n't know which way to turn . " " Well , do n't turn this way , " said Peter . " And how dop75you know I 'm naked ? Oh , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been thinking it was mine all the time . I 'm so upset . No wonder you know how I am . " In the darkness Jo laughed evilly . " I saw your impassioned entrance , " she gloated . " If you do n't keep your hands off , you 'll see my impassionedexit , " he retorted . " All women seem ter be loose , " muttered Little Arthur moodily , his thoughts reverting to Martha and the harem . " Were n't like that when I was a boy . " " You 're no bigger than a nipper now , " retorted Jo . " Perhaps not , " said the pickpocket , " but I got more sense . Why do n't you keep your bold hands off the gentleman ? He do n't understand your common ways . " " I 'll make them unmistakable , " said the girl . " What are we going ter do , mister ? " Little Arthur asked hopelessly . " There ai n't no good in her . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me into this . " " No , I did n't , " the pickpocket protested . " I was trying to get away and you insisted on following me . " " Naturally , " replied Peter . " Must have wanted me mighty bad , " observed LittleArthur , " to have followed me in your condition . " " I wanted to kill you , " admitted Peter , " and I 'm not at allsure I wo n't . " " Do n't think about it any more , " said Little Arthur soothingly . " My , you 're thin , " said Jo in a surprised voice . " Take your hand from my ribs , " Peter commanded . " 1 lave n't you any shame ? " " No , " answered Jo promptly . " Not since you started in . This morning in the office you try to take off your drawers . On the way home you practically assault me in the subway. nd now to cap the damn climax you follow me nakedlyp76into a dark closet . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you act like that ? " " Is that right , lady ? " asked Little Arthur , thinking that indeed he had got himself into bad company . " Did he do all them things , taking off his drawers and all ? " " Sure , I 'm right , " said Jo . " It was just his drawers this morning . That seemed to satisfy him . Now it 's all or nothing . Do n't know what he 'll think of doing next . " " Hope he stops thinking altogether if he 's going ter carry on like that , " said Little Arthur , making no attempt to disguise his disappointment in Peter . " Someone will have to do some inspired brainwork to think us out of this place , " Peter announced to his unseen companions . " Does your spine begin there ? " Josephine suddenly asked in an interested voice . " No , " replied Peter passionately . " That 's where it ends . " " Oh , " said the girl rather hurriedly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your hands to yourself ? " demandedPeter . " Thank Gord it 's dark in here , " murmured Little Arthur . " I would n't know where to look if it was n't . " " Throw the little beggar out on his ear , " urged Jo . " Think I 'll get out myself , naked as I am , " declared Peter . " It 's better than staying in here and being explored like a map . " For some minutes Sanders had been evincing an unusual interest in the closet . Aunt Sophie , sailing from the drawing room with a group of guests at her elbows , chief among whom was Yolanda , actually saw the man with his ear almost if not quite pressed to the door . " What on earth are you doing there , Sanders ? " she inquiredfussily . " You look as if you had seen a ghost . " Sanders nodded his sleek head wisely . " I believe I 'm hearing them , madam , " he vouchsafed inp77a low voice . " This closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nonsense ! " the splendid lady tossed out . " You 're running down , Sanders . Closets do n't talk . " " This one does , " Sanders assured her . " It carries on a **25;1383;TOOLONG in as many different voices , madam . One sounds strangely like a woman 's . " " What ? " exclaimed Aunt Sophie . " A woman in that closet ? That is queer . " " Perhaps Sanders had better look , " Yolanda Wilmont suggested . " Sneak thieves , you know . " " Sneak thieves are not given to holding animated conversationsin closets , " objected Mr. Prescott Gates who , becauseof his remote connection with a law firm , felt that his knowledge of sneak thieves was more extensive than the others . " We 're not acquainted with the habits of sneak thieves , " Yolanda contributed coldly . " However , I do believe that closet should be investigated . There are several valuable furs inside . " " By all means , " agreed Miss Sophie Van Dyck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , when Sanders endeavored to carry out this order , seemed inclined to argue the point . For several momentsit quivered elastically like a thing of life and purpose in the hands of the butler ; then , with a groan of utter despair which sounded hollowly in the hall , it flew partly open . Sanders recoiled as if from the pit of hell itself . Instantly the door closed of its own volition with a bang of remonstrance . Inarticulate sounds issued from the closet , sounds of whining protest . " What on earth is it , Sanders ? " Aunt Sophie demanded in a strained voice . " Sounds like an animal . " " Must I say , Miss Van Dyck ? " asked Sanders in a corneredvoice.  | " Certainly you must , " she retorted . " What would Mr. Peter think if he came home and found his closet full of strangers ? He dislikes things like that . " Wondering in a dazed sort of way what things could be even remotely like the things he had momentarily glimpsed , Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , What 's inside ? " Yolanda Wilmont asked insistently . " Well , madam , " said Sanders reluctantly , " there seems to be more in there than valuable furs at the moment . Looked like quite a gathering to me . " " Tell them to come out this instant , " Miss Van Dyck commanded . " I 'd hardly suggest that , madam , " said Sanders in a shocked voice . " Here , Sanders , " put in Prescott Gates . " I 'll handle this situation . I 'll jolly well make them come out , whoever they are . " I strongly advise against it , sir , " said Sanders . " Not with the ladies present , if I may say so . " " What on earth , Sanders ? " exclaimed a young and rather swagger looking maiden whose eyes gave the impression of having seen about all there was to be seen in life . " Just for that I 'll never leave until that closet has given up its dead . " " Why not tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascadesof lace , " exactly what you saw , and then let us decide ? " " Yes , " agreed Aunt Sophie . " We 're growing decidedly impatientwith all this beating about the bush . Speak up , man ! " " Well , " began the butler in a voice of academic detachment , " you see , there seems to be an entirely naked gentlemanin that closet " " Impossible ! " exclaimed Miss Van Dyck . " I very much wish it were , madam , " Sanders continued piously . " But that 's not all . This gentleman has either beenp79undressed by a lady or , having undressed himself , is about to undress her . " " Need you be so graphic ? " inquired Yolanda . " The picture was remarkably vivid , " explained the butler . " I wonder where they think they are ? " Aunt Sophie wonderedaloud . " Certainly not at a private reception , " observed the lacy lady , regarding the door with thoughtful eyes . " That is , not at a nice reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet ? " Aunt Sophie continued , bemused . " Practically anything by now , " said the girl with the worldly eyes . " Especially if the gentleman has succeeded in carrying out his intentions . " " You mean in that closet ? " Yolanda demanded incredulously . " What 's wrong with the closet ? " demanded the other girl philosophically . " Many have managed with less . " " What a shocking situation ! " murmured the lace-bedecked lady . " Should n't something be done ? Ca n't you speak to them , Sanders  --  admonish them ? " " Certainly , madam , " replied Sanders , his suavity regained . " How would you suggest wording it ? " " Why , tell them to stop , of course , " Aunt Sophie snapped irritably . " Stop what , madam , " the butler inquired . " You can be most exasperating at times for a man of your age , Sanders , " Miss Van Dyck complained . " Tell them to stop whatever they 're doing . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not sure just what they are doing . It would be pure speculation . " " Not so pure at that , " put in the girl , " but it does seem logical , does n't it , Sanders ? " " I must confess , Miss Sedgwick , " said Sanders with becomingmodesty , " I have never been in the same situation . "  |p8o  " No more have I , " the girl retorted , " but I can use my imagination . " " I wish you would n't , " Yolanda remarked frigidly . Mr. Prescott Gates now felt called upon once more to displayhis greater knowledge of the seamy side of life . " If they are professional sneak thieves , " he advanced weightily , " I hardly think they 'd endanger their chances by that sort of nonsense . " " What sort of nonsense ? " Miss Sedgwick inquired with disarming innocence . " And what makes you call it non-sense ? " " Do n't answer her , Prescott , " said Yolanda . " And all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in a tragic voice , " God only knows what is going on inside that closet . " " Perhaps only God should know , " replied the stout lady with the resignation of a true believer . " I have an idea , " Miss Sedgwick offered . " Perhaps a man and wife wandered into that closet and not being able to find their way out became so exhausted  --  you know , so discouragedabout it all  --  they just decided to go to bed . " " Do n't be childish , Madge Sedgwick , " Aunt Sophie scolded . " Well , at least , I 've got ' em married , " said the girl . " That 's more than any of you have done . " " You said a gentleman , ' Sanders , " Aunt Sophie went on in a worried voice to the butler . " Are you sure he was a gentleman ? " " That 's difficult to tell , madam , " said Sanders . " He did n't have a stitch on . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without any clothes on there 's not a scrap of difference between a sneak thief and a gentleman . " " I should think all naked men would look a little sneaky , " the lady in lace unhelpfully contributed.  | " There should be some distinction , " Miss Van Dyck protestedindignantly . " Yes . It would be convenient on occasions to be able to tellat a glance , " Madge Sedgwick remarked as if to herself . " What did he look like , Sanders ? " Yolanda Wilmont demanded . " Did you recognize his face ? " " I did n't see his face , Miss Yolanda , " the butler explained . " What did you see ? " asked Madge with lively interest . " His back , miss , " said Sanders . " He turned it rather briskly , I thought . " " At least he had the instincts of a gentleman , " remarked the stout lady . " Oh , I do n't know , " Madge Sedgwick countered . " Even a sneak thief might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? " Prescott Gates inquired . " I got the impression I 'd seen her before , sir , " admitted the butler . " Looked very much like a young woman who was here a little earlier announcing she was in an interesting con-dition . " " Sanders , you keep the most extraordinary things to yourself , " Aunt Sophie said with severity . " Do you mean to say you put this person in that closet to bear her child ? " " No , madam , " Sanders smoothly replied . " I rather concludedshe 'd left to commit suicide . She was inquiring about t he rivers . I gave her adequate directions . " " Maybe she came back to find out which was the deepest , " Madge Sedgwick suggested . " Heavens on earth ! " exclaimed Aunt Sophie distractedly . " What are we going to do ? Here we have a naked man in the closet and a woman going to have a baby or commit suicide or something even worse . Prescott , you 're a man . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for a policeman , " Mr. Gates replied with surprisingdecision as he hurried to the door . " Should think a preacher or a doctor would do betterp82according to the circumstances , " Madge flung after him , but Mr. Gates was already gone . " That tears it , " whispered Peter Van Dyck to his companions in the closet . " That unweaned ass has gone to get a cop . " " Gard ! " breathed Little Arthur . " There ai n't a pair of drawers made that 's worth a pinch . " " Ah , " came the voice of Josephine , " how about mine , Little Arthur ? " " Make her stop talking like that , mister , " the small thief asked in an injured voice . " We 're in a very bad spot . " " Do n't tell me , " said Peter . " I know it already , and I 'm going to get out of my section at once . " " Do n't mean ter say you 're going out there in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man inquired in an awed voice . " Almost , " Peter told him . " With the addition of this coat . " Fumbling in the darkness , he seized the first coat his hands encountered and squeezed himself into it . Fortunately for Peter 's self-assurance he was unable to see how he looked . He was wearing a fur coat belonging to his Aunt Sophie . It was short but luckily full . " Wait a second , " said Josephine . " You 're not going to leave me alone in here with that dip . I 'm going to disguise myself , too . " " No fear , " shot back Little Arthur . " I do n't associate with the likes of you . " " Oh ! " cried Josephine , enraged . " I 'll strip him to the buff . " " What 's that ? " asked Arthur anxiously . " I do n't know , " the girl replied , " but it must be awful . " " Will you two please stop bickering ? " cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm ready , " said Jo . " Go right ahead . I defy recogni-tion . " THE LOQUACIOUS CLOSET 83 " What have you got on ? " Peter was interested enough to inquire . " Goggles and a long duster , " the girl said briefly . " Let 's change ? " Peter suggested . " Too late now , " she told him . " We 've got to hurry right along . " " Do n't leave me here alone , " Little Arthur pleaded . " I 'd like to leave you lifeless , " Jo informed him . " Almost wish you would , " bleakly Arthur replied . The policeman , followed importantly by Prescott Gates , arrived just in time to witness the emergence of Peter Van Dyck . What struck the officer as being especially remarkable about this odd affair was the length and bareness of Peter 's legs . In real life Peter 's legs were not really so bad . Though long and slim they were at least not distorted . They were just ordinary male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , however , protruding as they were from a woman 's fur coat , they fairly screamed for attention . The officer 's eyes responded . He could not recall ever having seen such peculiar-looking legs on either man or beast . In spite of this they seemed to carry their owner along busily enough as he made for the front staircase . Behind him trailed a strange object which at first glance did not appear to be entirely human . Josephine in goggles and duster hurried to the front door , where she was stopped by the officer , who told her , " Oh , no , you do n't ! " in what can only be described as a nasty voice . Little Arthur , apparently preferring arrest to being left alone with his thoughts , brought up a shrinking rear . Walking nervously on tiptoe , he started to follow Peter . Aunt Sophie 's voice stopped him . Aunt Sophie 's voice stopped everyone , in fact . " Peter ! " she cried . " Peter ! " " Yes , Aunt Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely with his attire and which almost stupefiedthe policeman , who had expected something entirely dif- ferent from such an object . " Yes , Aunt Sophie . Were you calling me ? " " Peter , " continued the outraged lady , " what in the world have you been up to ? " " Nothing at all , Auntie , " he assured her , growing more uncomfortably aware of a sea of upturned faces . " Merely getting ready , you know . Making little arrangements . " " Is that person following you ? " Miss Van Dyck demanded , pointing a quivering finger at Little Arthur , shaking as unobtrusivelyas possible on the stairs . Peter started visibly . He found himself extremely nervous . " What person ? " he gasped ; then , glancing back and encounteringthe mute appeal in the miserable little creature 's eyes , his heart melted . " Oh , that person , " he said hastily . " Yes . He 's following me  --  how do you do , everybody . " Here Peter thought it best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Sophie , " he hurried on . " He 's following me . I asked him to . I Ic 's helping me to get ready . My new valet . Do you like him ? " " Decidedly not ! " exploded Aunt Sophie . " He has the face of a born criminal . " " Say , " put in the policeman , " how many more of you are there in that closet ? " " What , officer ? " said Peter . " How many more of me are there in that closet ? No more at all . I 'm the only one . " " Does your nephew happen to be nuts , lady ? " the policemanasked Miss Van Dyck . " No , " Yolanda answered for the stunned woman , " but I fear he 's suffering a little from overwork . " " Thank you , Yolanda , " called Peter with a fearful smile . " But if you want to know , I 'm suffering hideously from overexpos ure . " The coat ! The coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . Look out ! " Peter snatched at the coat in the nick of time , then wavedp85lightly to the girl , who of all the group had not averted her eyes . " Thanks , Madge , " he called . " Would n't want that to happen . " " I was n't anxious about it for myself , " she replied . " I was thinking of your aunt and Yolanda . " " Thanks , " Yolanda told her . " We are quite able to think for ourselves . " " Oh , very well , " said Miss Sedgwick . " I do n't care if he takes it off altogether and dances like a savage . " " No doubt , " said the other sweetly . " If it 's all the same to you ladies , " called Peter , " I 'd prefer to keep it on . And I do n't feel like dancing . " " My stockings ! My stockings ! They 're gone ! " burst suddenlyfrom the object behind the goggles , making a frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-flight at the end of the officer 's arm . " None of that , " he said rudely . " You 're staying here . " " Oh , am I ? " Jo replied , dealing him a clever Gallic kick . " I want my stockings . " " Ah-ha , " observed Madge Sedgwick , triumphantly . " Then he did undress her . " Probably because they assumed it to be a part of a policeman 's duty , no one seemed to pay the slightest atten-t ion to the officer doubled up in anguish . That is , no one save Little Arthur , who , for the moment forgetting his own troublesin the presence of those of the law , was laughing weakly upon the stairs . " Did it hurt much ? " solicitously asked Peter , who from his Olympian heights had witnessed the incident . " Hurt ? " gasped the policeman , stung by the inadequacy of the word . " It 's ruined I am to the grave . " " See what you 've done to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josephine clawing in the closet.  | " Ca n't help that , " she answered . " No low cop can come between me and my stockings . " " Oh , this is too disgraceful , " Sophie Van Dyck informed all present . " Too disgraceful for words . " " Not disgraceful enough for my words , " muttered Josephine . " Ah ! Here they are  --  my stockings ! " As the girl rose with a wad of stockings in her hand , Sophie Van Dyck directed on her the full force of her attack . " Young woman , " she demanded , " did you tell my butler you were going to have a baby ? " " After being cooped up in that closet with your naked nephew , " Jo replied indignantly as she stuffed the stockings back in their tender concealment , allowing one of them to dangle untidily down the front of the duster , " after being in there like that , I would n't be a bit surprised if I had a male quartet . Would you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this discussion . " May I ask if you have anything on beneath that duster ? " she asked . " What do you think ? " replied Josephine . " What has he got on beneath that fur coat ? " As she pointed to the odd figure on the stairs , everyone looked up and decided it did not have much . Before the direct fire of so many calculating glances Peter shrank a little . By this time the injured officer had discovered he could stand erect . " What are you laughing at ? " he demanded reproachfully of Little Arthur . " At them , " said Little Arthur , pointing to the legs above him . " What ! " cried Peter , turning fiercely upon the pickpocket . " You lying little " Do n't say it , mister , " Arthur pleaded . " I was n't laughing at all . "  | " You 'll be hysterical when I get you up before the boys , " the assaulted policeman promised him . " Aunt Sophie , " Yolanda said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . This has spoiled everything . " " I agree with that , " Aunt Sophie replied . " But just the same we 'll carry on as if nothing had occurred . Take our dear guests back to the reception room . " " Hoorah ! " cried Jo , tossing up her arms , the hands of which lay concealed well down in the sleeves of the duster . " You 're saved , Peter . You 're saved . " " Saved for what ? " he asked her . " Another day ? " " For us , of course , " she replied . " For me ! " " A living death , " he answered . " Gard spare you , sir , from that one , " put in Little Arthur piously . " No matter what you 've done . " The bell rang , and Sanders , as if arising from a long illness , admitted several guests . With startled eyes they regarded the group on the stairs , then transferred their gaze to the enigmaticfigure lurking within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like a strange bird from behind a pair of goggles . " What 's that ? " asked a tall gentleman , his face growing pale beneath a fresh massage . " Do n't know , " gasped a lady with him . " It 's awful . And Peter Van Dyck is almost . . . " Her voice trailed away . " It 's charades , my dear " Aunt Sophie smoothly explained . " It 's been such a lark , Yolanda , take them directly to the drawing room . Cocktails . " Yolanda did . " Now , young lady , " Aunt Sophie continued severely , " your conduct has been most disgraceful . I do n't know what to do with you . Obviously you are a thief  --  perhaps even worse . You must leave this house at once , quietly and without furtherviolence . You will , of course , leave our stolen articles behind . "  | " They 're not so hot , anyway , " said Jo . " And they 're not stolen , " called Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking a little lonely in the great hall . " I 'll explain everything , Auntie . You see , I 'm sending those things over to one of my friends . He 's going on a trip . Wanted to borrow them . Sent one of the maids  --  a fresh piece , I admit  --  but that 's how she got here . " " But why is she wearing them in that ridiculous fashion ? " Aunt Sophie persisted , her curiosity overcoming her eagernessto believe in any comfortable explanation . " Oh , that , " replied Peter , thinking quickly . " More convenient , you know . Does n't have to carry them . Perhaps it even amuses her . " " Well , it does n't amuse me , " declared Aunt Sophie with conviction . " Come , Little Arthur , " said Peter . " Get me ready . " He paused and looked back at Jo , who had snatched off the goggles and was standing gazing up at him like a child about to be sent to bed ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to sleep alone . " Good-bye , mister , " she said . " And thanks for all the things you 've done  --  even though you should n't have . " Jo made sure that Yolanda , emerging from the drawing room , overheard her parting remark . " Hold on ! " cried the officer . " Do n't I make no pinch ? " " Pinch yourself , brother , " said Jo . " You 're sleeping on your feet . " The front door closed behind her.  |p89Six  Characters Embark in a FogWHEN PETER VAN DYCK CLOSED THE DOOR TO HIS ROOMaction was accompanied by such violence that Little Arthur , doglike at his heels , barely escaped bisection . Unlike  |p90a  dog , however , the small , dishonest man emitted no yelp of protest . He merely stood looking at the door and thought of the policeman whose indignant voice still sounded discordantlyin the hall below . " Sanders , " he heard Aunt Sophie saying , " take the officer to the kitchen and provide for him properly . Perhaps a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pain . " Little Arthur 's heart sank . Retreat was cut off in the rear . Ahead of him lay a decidedly delicate , not to say dangerous , interview . Squaring his thin shoulders , he raised a timid hand and knocked . " Come in , you criminal ! " a hoarse voice shouted . " Since when have you troubled to knock on doors ? " Automatically the shoulders resumed their former droop of nervous exhaustion as the criminal entered the room . " Since when have you troubled to knock ? " the voice repeateddisagreeably . " Answer me that . " Arthur noticed with increasing dread that the owner of the voice was drinking whiskey straight in great gulps . " Always knock , mister , " he muttered . " Outa hours , that is . " When not calling in a professional capacity , " Peter added sarcastically . " That would be silly , " said Little Arthur on the defensive . " You malignant germ ! " replied Peter , his throat working horribly , Arthur thought , as whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  worse than louse ! " " Mister , " protested Little Arthur , for some strange reason feeling more hurt for the other 's lack of refinement than for any reflection cast on either himself or his habits , " is that a nice way ter talk ? " " Perhaps not , " said Peter after a moment 's reflection . " There is n't any nice way to talk  --  not to you . " p 91 " But I 'm only a pickpocket , " the man modestly explained . " This was my first second-story . " Peter gulped down some more whiskey while considering this statement . " How do you mean , " he asked , " your first second-story ? Are you trying to confuse me ? " " No , mister , " said the little dip , " I 'm giving it to you straight . This is the first time I ever done a second-story . I was only after some drawers  --  an old pair or so . " " You lie , " Peter told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear my drawers . They 'd hang all over your little wizened legs . " " I ai n't perticular , " Little Arthur said stoutly . " Scrunch ' em on somehow , what with a pin or a string or an old nail , for that matter . " Peter thought this possibility over while absently redonning his recently shed raiment . " You must be mad about drawers , " he admitted at last , " and I do n't care a damn if you are . Might be much worse . As a matter of fact , some nice , clean persons might even consider it creditable , Little Arthur , for a man to risk losing his shirt for the sake of a pair of drawers . But I , who do n't care a snap of my fingers about either shirt or drawers , ca n't sec it in that light . " " That 's a powerful queer-looking pair you got on now , " vouchsafed Little Arthur . " Orange stripes , no less ! Ca n't say as I 'd care a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? " Peter remarked coldly . " Well , I 'd like to know who sat you up in judgment on my drawers ? You never had a pair of silk drawers on your mean little shanks in your life . Not real silk , " he added , his thoughts reverting to Josephine Duval . " No , mister , " Little Arthur agreed . " I wear regular drawers  --  men 's drawers . After taking a pike at them things ,  | I can see that all my trouble has been a sheer waste of time . " " Just for that , " said Peter , with a whiskey glitter in his eye , " I 'm going to make you wear a pair of my drawers , the funniest pair I 've got , and believe me , I 've got some funny ones . Much funnier than these , " his voice trailed on as he rummaged busily in a bureau . " Ha ! This pair 's a humdinger . A regular scream . You 'll go well in these . Wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red and purple grapes  --  bunches of ' em . A cute idea . " He turned with the garment to confront the stricken eyes of the petty felon . " Down with those trousers , " he grated . " Yank ' em off with a snap . " " But , mister , " objected the shocked man , " I 'd have to undress naked to put them things on . You see , I wear allovers like  --  long legs and all . " " Eh ? " said Peter . " Oh , all right . That does n't matter a bit . You can drag ' em up over your long ones . Make it snappy now . " " That would n't look right , mister . " Arthur 's voice was eloquent with reproach . " You 're going to wear these drawers , " Peter told the pitiful object , " if I have to disjoint you to get ' em on . Hurry up , man . Do n't make me lose my temper . " " If you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " I think I 'll lose my mind . " " You 'll lose more than that if you do n't , " Peter snapped , taking a step towards the man . " Oh , Gord , " whined the unfortunate creature , hastily removing his outer garments , " all this terror and disgrace just because I got a yen ter feel clean ! " " You do n't look so hot , yourself , " Peter assured him as he contemplated the homely lines of the battered union suit . " From the back you look simply shocking  --  worse than I ever thought a man could get . "  |p93Little  Arthur spun round as if stung . " Cut it out , " he said in some confusion . " Now yank these on right over them , " commanded Peter . " Anything to blot out that awful sight . The back especially . " Little Arthur yanked them on , and Peter was vividly remindedof a medieval court chamberlain who had fallen upon evil days . A knock sounded obsequiously on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxed to its utmost to restrain a slight outcry . All the human side of the butler cried out to inquire what inconceivable events were taking place in this room . However , his professional ethics forced him to present a passive face . In his eyes alone could be detected a faint gleam of revulsion . The expression in Little Arthur 's eyes as he stood like a shamed maiden in a slave market , as well he might in his weird attire , defied all description . This was because Little Arthur , realizing the delicacy of his position , had bashfully lowered his gaze . Sanderscleared his throat behind a large fat hand . " Beg pardon , Mr. Peter , " he murmured . " Is this the new valet ? " " The very newest , Sanders , " replied Peter . " I 've been trying to get some conception of how I look in my own drawers . Never had the opportunity before . What do you think of them , Sanders ? " " Very nice , sir , I am sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The background is a trifledingy . " " Oh , that 's all right , " remarked Peter airily . " We can remove the background and have them washed . " " Burned , " suggested Sanders . " That ai n't nice , " broke in Little Arthur with a sob inhis voice . " Call that there copper and let him take me away . " " I was instructed to inform you , Mr. Peter , " went on thebutler , disdainfully disregarding the little crook , " that Missp94Yolanda and your aunt await your presence below , sir . It is almost time to call the motor if you intend to cross by ferry . " " Why the ferry ? " demanded Peter . " Miss Yolanda finds the tube rather common , sir , " said Sanders , and God only knew what the man was thinking . " She has decided objections to the ventilation . " Peter took another drink . " Little Arthur , " snapped Peter , suddenly brisk , " pack a suitcase for me  --  not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , mister ! " protested the pickpocket . " Pack it like I am ? " " Certainly , " replied Peter . " It will amuse me while I 'm dressing . And listen to me , Sanders . Tell Miss Yolanda with my compliments that if she does n't like the tubes she 'll have to bear with the subway downtown . I wo n't drive or be driven in traffic on a night like this . " " I quite understand , Mr. Peter , " said Sanders , and with a lingering glance at Little Arthur quietly withdrew . " You oughten ter have let him see me like this , " cornplainedthe little man in the large drawers . " It 's more than flesh can bear . " " I think Sanders stood it admirably , taking you all in all , " asserted Peter , " which is the only way to take you . Step lively with that packing . " Half an hour later Peter and Yolanda left the Van Dyck residence on foot for a week-end in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as well as he could under the weight of two suitcases . Peter was a little drunk and Yolanda a little peeved . Peter 's explanations of his conduct had been almost incoherent . He had expected her to take too many things for granted . Still , until the country had recovered somewhat from its protracted attack of melancholia she saw no advantage to herself in precipitat/ing an open break with her fiance , who was indubitably more than enough mad . As long as coffee remained in popular favor , she would put up with his eccentricities  --  humor them , in fact . " The rest will do you good , " she told him as they walked to the subway . " I never find these house parties in the least way restful , " replied Peter complainingly . " They wear me down a lot . " " I know , my dear , " she said tolerantly , " but one must be seen . Especially persons in our position . Ca n't afford to stagnate , you know . Must carry on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean going to house parties , dinners , dances , and all ? " incredulously Peter asked her . " Obviously , " she replied with the superior patience of a higher being . " What good does that do ? " the man wanted to know . " Keeps society on an even keel . Offsets the influences of radicalism  --  communism , " she assured him without batting an eye . " Shows the nation at large that the real people are not taking seriously all this talk about depression . " " Strikes me as being a bad excuse for doing even worse , " observed Peter . " And as for stagnation , that 's all you do at these house parties  --  stagnate . Not that I object to that , but I prefer to do it in my own home . " " You 're such a child , " said Yolanda , tapping him lightly on the arm . Peter 's reply to this was rotten but inaudible . From the shadows of a building a small figure in a ridiculousduster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Arthur had lurched by with his burden , the gure discarded the duster and became an exceedingly wellbuiltyoung woman . With a set face and a determined eye Josephine Duval proceeded to stalk her prey . She was bound for New Jersey herself . She might just as well kill two birds with one stone . And if she did not succeed in killing them , she could at least make them quite uncomfortable . Josephine had a lovely body , but her mind was altogether bad . An ideal combination . Ahead of her Little Arthur stumbled through the fog blowing in from the river . He was wishing he had the courage to drop the bags and run , realizing with a pang of regret that he could not make his escape with them . That same evening Bishop Waller was gratified to discover that both God and his own inclinations coincided in calling him and his newly acquired jaegers to the state of New Jersey . Accordingly he decided to answer this call in person as well as in jaegers . Furthermore it was his ecclesiastical preference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he earnestly hoped would be less crowded than the tubes . " And Blakely , " he told his man , at the same time striving to tune out of his voice an overtone of mundane pride , " be sure you put in an extra pair of those new jaegers  --  the spring-weight ones . " Blakely had hoped to be permitted to pack a pair of these new jaegers . He admired them tremendously . In fact , in his quiet humble heart of hearts he almost found the hardihood to wish that he too were a bishop so that he might be able to wear drawers similar to the man he served . " They 're an excellent pair , sir , " he observed as he reverentiallycarried the new jaegers to the suitcase . " An excellent pair , if I may say so . " " Certainly , Blakely , " beamed the Bishop . " By all means admire the drawers . " He found himself greatly pleased . Crossing the room , he stood for a moment by his man and admired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued pontifically . " Honestly made and generously fashioned . I find them exceedingly comfortable . " " I 'm sure you must , sir , " agreed Blakely , his eyes involuntarilystraying to the lower half of the Bishop as if endeavoringto visualize the ineffable comfort enjoyed by this man of God . A few minutes later Bishop Waller departed . Stepping into a taxi , he instructed the driver to proceed with judicious perseveranceto a downtown ferry slip . Then , with a clean conscience and a contented mind , he settled back in the cab and awaited future developments . Bishop Waller had not long to wait . The future developed almost too soon . At about this time Aspirin Liz , after a dust-mottled sort of day , felt herself deeply stirred by a craving for beer  --  beer and a little companionship over a table unspoiled by a cloth . She desired to relax for a while with the knowledge that a bar was within easy call , that she had merely to press her finger lazily on a bell to have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay to overflowing . In her youth , when she derived both pleasure and profit from her figure , she had sedulously aschewed beer . Now , when her once lovely body had become an expense without compensation , she indulged it affectionately for the sake of what it had been . She gave it beer up to and sometimes past the limits of its ample capacity . With grim satisfaction she plunged into it great sides of corned beef rising like rocks of Gibraltar from choppy seas of cabbage . She talked to middle-agedladies of similar tastes , and discovered that , no matter how dissimilar their lives may have been , their interestsin life were basically the same  --  a little rest , a little peace and quiet , food , drink , an audience , and a room of one 's own where one could remove in comfort one 's stays and shoes.  |p98For  Aspirin Liz the most satisfactory escape from the solitude of her four walls lay on the opposite bank of the Hudson . It was her custom occasionally to take a ferry headed for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of several waterfront cafes in which she was both known and admired for her true worth  --  a good , solid , level-headed woman with a sincere fondness for beer and a capacity to hold it . After a day devoted to aspirin , the retired model felt she owed herself beer . And this is an excellent way to feel  --  one of the most satisfactory feelings extant . Many persons want beer , and almost as many drink beer , but it is given to few  --  and then very rarely  --  to be convinced that not only do they want beer but that they actually deserve beer , need it , in fact . Therefore , it was with a feeling of rectitude almost approachingthe self-sacrificial that Aspirin Liz prepared her face , adjusted her hat , shrugged her hips into proper working relations with her corset and , after looking both for and into her pocketbook , departed in the direction of the river . Thus it came about that the same ferryboat was enabled to set at naught the various plans and prospects of a diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ferryboat to mingle the interests and alter the destinies of persons whose lives had hitherto developed along seldom-intersecting paths . And as these several characters converged upon this ferryboat , the fog blew in their faces and blanketed their lungs . Figures swift with purpose lived jerkily for an instant in the eyes of others , then faded out . Trucks tunneled through wet fluff and dragged a hole behind them . Sound and light were muffled . Distance ceased to be . Each man carried with him the boundaries of his universe . Out there on the river a little hell of whistles dwelt in the heart of the fog . The ferryboat drew out . Mist rolled down on its exit . Ap99sharp report and a spit of fire . Then fog where a figure had stood  --  a half-crouched shape peering in the direction of the ferryboat now unseen . There were very few passengers who ascribed the report of the gun to a cause other than the back-firing of an automobile . Little Arthur was not one of these. 4p100A Shot in the ArmIT REALLY DOES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired , save for the fact that it caused Little Arthur to fall promptly to the afterdeck of the outgoing ferryboat and to remain there , to all intents and purposes aA SHOT IN THE ARM IOIp101dead pickpocket . And let it be added that no one was more convinced of this fact than was Little Arthur himself . To begin with , the day had proved too much for his delicately organized nervous structure . Add to this a frail body and two suitcases , and it immediately becomes evident that Little Arthur was in no condition to stand a great deal more of anything . In short , this pocket edition of petty larceny was through  --  a broken reed . At the same moment that his newly acquired valet fell to the deck , Peter Van Dyck lurched a little as a stinging sensation manifested itself in his left upper arm . This he promptly dismissed in favor of peering down into the face of the stricken man . It was not much of a face to peer down into  --  in truth , it was a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the unprepossessing expression Little Arthur turned to the world , it was obvious he had been mortally wounded . But what creature in the world was so lacking in aspirationas to want to wound Little Arthur ? At his most vigorous moments the small felon was only half alive . This did not mean that the man responsible for his death would be regarded by law as only half a murderer . Not at all . Peter in his heart swore that if he ever discovered who had fired the shot he , Peter Van Dyck , would make it his business to see that the wretch was regarded as being something more than a murderer . In the short time Little Arthur had been with him , Peter had formed a sort of watchful yet commiserating attachment for this unreliable visitant from the underworld . It was one of those inexplicable affections that defy all natural laws , because it was far from natural to be fond of Little Arthur . Most people found it impossible . But Peter was not like most people . He was a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time much better . They had been through a lot together in a few crowded hours , he and Little Arthur . They had suf-pIO2fered much . Side by side they had passed through humiliationand public disgrace . With a sudden pang Peter thought of the drawers he had forced upon the now lifeless legs . Then came another thought  --  a worse one . What would the undertaker think about those drawers ? Would the man be able to survive the shock ? Would he be able to approach those drawers in a purely professional capacity or would he consider them in the light of a personal affront ? No undertaker , no matter how case-hardened , would be able to regard them with indifference . No , those drawers presented a problem . Peter felt a little responsible . Life was funny  --  always letting one in for things . While these thoughts were flashing through his mind , a small but keenly interested crowd had collected round Peter and the fallen man . Peter knelt down and began to examine him . There was no mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who pipped him , mister ? " asked a man 's hoarse voice . " Who did what ? " Peter inquired . " Pipped , " replied the voice . " You know  --  gave the little bloke an airing . " " If you mean who murdered this poor devil , " said Peter , strongly objecting to the speaker 's language , " I would n't be surprised if it were you . Gave him an airing ! Is that any way to speak of a man shot down in cold blood ? " " Where 's the cold blood ? " another spectator morbidly wanted to know . " There ai n't a speck on him , " announced still another spectator disappointedly . " Not a speck . And blood ai n't cold to begin with , even a silly-looking geezer 's like that . " Peter was moved to reply . " Do n't let 's go into the temperature of his blood right now , " he observed with what he hoped was withering sar-pI03casm . " You 'd look silly yourself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , mister , " answered the other . " I 'd look plain scared . " Dismissing this person as unimportant , Peter endeavored to turn Little Arthur over to ascertain if he had been shot from behind . Once more he felt a stinging sensation in his left arm . " Yolanda , " he called , for the first time remembering his fiancee . " Would you very much mind giving me a hand with Little Arthur ? He 's been shot . " " I would n't touch Little Arthur with a pair of tongs , " Yolanda coldly replied from the outer fringe of the crowd . " I am waiting for you to take me to my seat . " " I 'll help you , " said a familiar voice , as Jo knelt down beside him . " Are n't you strong enough to turn the little blighter over yourself ? " Peter tried without success to conceal his relief when his worried blue eyes looked into the warmly brown ones of Josephine . " I 'm strong enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get you , mister , " the girl replied in a voice that denoted long years of close companionship . " Let 's go . " " This is n't a sporting event , " said Peter . " Do n't be so snappy about it . You 'll roll him off the boat . " Together they turned the still figure over . Peter was unable to find any sign of bullet marks . He had been cowardly enough to leave the trousers for Jo to examine . This did not appear to gag her in the least . Several heads were peeringdown interestedly over her shoulder . " From the holes in them pants , " said an awed voice , " it looks like he 'd fairly been riddled with bullets . " " Must have been a machine gun that pinged him in the pants , " another observer declared. pI04Peter also objected to the use of the term " ping . " However , he refrained from protesting , realizing that these callouspersons must have cut their teeth on lethal weapons and played tag with machine-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , " said Jo in a brisk voice , " the bullets must have balked at his drawers . From the littleI can see , I do n't much blame them at all . " " Those are my drawers , " objected Peter . " What are your drawers doing on him , mister ? " a deeply interested voice inquired . Peter looked pained . " Does it matter , " he asked , " what my drawers are doing on this man ? He 's been mortally wounded . That 's what mattersnow . Whether my drawers are off or on him makes absolutelyno difference . In fact , " he added with a touch of bitterness , " it does n't very much matter if he 's wearing any drawers at all . " " Well , a guy 's got to wear some sort of drawers , " retorted the rebuked spectator in an injured voice . " Not the sort I sec bits of , " objected another . Josephine 's calm voice cut short Peter 's reply to this fresh insult . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions ? " she asked . " There might be some life left in the little crook yet . " They returned the body to its former position and looked at it with baffled eyes . Peter 's left hand brushed against the pale face . Instinctively he drew his hand back . Little Arthur 's face presented a red smear . " Gord , " a voice whispered , " the little feller 's just beginning to bleed . How do you make that out ? " " Ai n't bleedin ' from no hole , " said another member of the helpful gathering . " Must be bleedin ' through his pores . " " How do you mean , " a third voice inquired , " bleedin ' through his paws ? He ai n't no dog . "  |p1o5  " Did n't say he was a dog , " the second voice snapped back . " Do n't have to be a dog to bleed through your pores . " " But you got to be an animal , " the other announced triumphantly . " I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the pores of his skin , " the second speaker replied somewhat wearily . " Never knew skin had no paws , " said his stubborn opponent . " You keep thinking of dogs ' paws , " the second man repliedalmost pleadingly , " while all the time I 'm talking about skin pores  --  tiny little holes . " " Well , why do n't you say little holes , " the persistent party demanded , " instead of using a lot of foreign language ? " " Would you believe it possible ? " Peter asked Josephine in a low voice . " And in the presence of death , at that . " " The trouble with you , " said the girl , " is that you let yourself get dragged in . You 're just as dumb as they are . Help me -- She stopped suddenly and looked at a dark stain on the left sleeve of Peter 's coat ; then her eyes sought his hand . Hood was dripping slowly from his knuckles . For a moment her hand flew to her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly , trying to keep her feelings from floodingthrough : " You 've been shot in the arm , Mr. Van Dyck . " " Me ? " inquired Peter . " That 's odd . My arm does feel a bit funny now that I come to think of it . " " What I want to know , " put in a fresh voice , a rough argumentative voice , " how can this guy bleed when the other idler 's shot ? " " Perhaps the bullet went clean through the little feller , " spectator explained , " stopping on its way first to kill him , d then bunged into this other bloke . " " Knew it was n't his paws , " an all too familiar voice putpI06in . " He ai n't shot at all . Them holes in his pants are just natural holes , worn out , like . " " Mean to tell me , " another man demanded , " this big guy gets shot and the little one falls down for him ? It ai n't rea-sonable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the first voice cried excitedly . " Was n't talking to you anyway . Just making a harmless suggestion . " " You mean useless , " sneered the other . By this time it was Peter 's turn to become indignant . He looked darkly upon the recumbent form of Little Arthurwhile Josephine did things to his arm . " Then that dirty dog of a thief , " he said as if to himself , " has been having a nice long rest while all the time I 've been shot in the arm and feeling sorry as hell for him . " " If you will select your valets from the scum of the underworld , " Josephine told him , looking closely at Little Arthur , " you must expect things like this to happen . " " Nobody could have expected this , " said Peter . " Say , mister , " put in a voice admiringly , " you must be pretty used to bullets if you do n't know when you 're shot . " " Either that or he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd damn well know if I was shot . " " I damn well wish you were , " grated Peter ; then , turning to the girl beside him : " I 've a good mind to pull down his trousers and see if he has n't been shot . Something 's surely wrong with him . " " Go on , " replied Jo . " Pull his trousers off for all I care . " Whatever the part of Little Arthur it was that remained alive must have been the modest part , for at the mention of his trousers his hands clutched them firmly and his eyes snapped open . " None of that , " he got out weakly but distinctly . " Them pants are up for good . " " Ai n't you even shot , buddy ? " a voice called out. pI07 " How do I know ? " Little Arthur answered . " I heard a shot and felt its breath . " The interrogator laughed ironically . " I guess you 're O. K. , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel a shot 's another . You just fainted from fright . " " Oh , yeah ? " retorted the small man , sitting up with an indignant snap . " Well , this shot did n't sound like no lullaby to me . It did n't exactly croon in my ear , if yer get what I mean . You 'd of fainted , too . " Little Arthur turned a pair of injured eyes on Peter , whom he regarded in the light of a patron and protector , but he found scant comfort in that quarter . " If you 've settled your discussion entirely to your own satisfaction , Little Arthur " Peter began coldly . " Oh , I do n't mind the likes of him , " the recovered crook assured Peter . " That 's good , " continued Peter with false solicitude . " But as I was saying , do you think it would inconvenience you too much if you got yourself to hell off that deck and looked for those two bags ? " " Ca n't you hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " was the pickpocket 's reasonable suggestion . " Little Arthur , " replied Peter , a feverish glitter burning In his eyes , " I 'm afraid you do n't quite understand the position . By rights I should be lying down where you are and you should be where I am . In other words , while you have been taking your ease on the flat of your back I 've been &lowly; bleeding to death looking for your wound , you Craven-spirited , low-down , grubby little snatch-purse . Is everything quite clear ? Get up , damn your eyes . " Little Arthur rose hastily from the deck . " Mean ter say you 're shot , mister ? " he asked nervously . " Sure , I 'm shot , " growled Peter , " and have been shot ever cc this ferryboat shoved off a couple of days ago . "  |p1o8  " Then why are you standing up on your feet ? " the small thief incredulously inquired . " We all ca n't lie down on our backs , " Peter told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Find those suitcases and come inside . I 'm getting weak . " Before they moved away , Josephine found an opportunity to add to the pickpocket 's mental unrest . " And if anything happens to Mr. Peter , " she assured the small man , " anything serious , that is , you 're going to spend the rest of your life flat on your back in jail , and I 'm going to put you there . " " Gord , lady ! " said Arthur . " Do n't feel that way . I ai n't done a thing . " " No , " she replied coldly , leading Peter away . " And you look as if you never will , you dip . " Yolanda met them at the entrance of the women 's section of the cabin . " It 's taking terribly long to get across , " she complained ; then coolly surveying Josephine : " You have met a friend , I see , Peter . " " Do n't you remember me ? " Jo asked her sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your fiance was nude with me in the closet . " " Heavens ! " exclaimed Yolanda . " I should think you 'd be ashamed to admit it . Are you really going to have a baby ? " " Several , I hope , some day , but not today , " said Jo . " You see , Miss Wilmont , your quondam fiance has been wounded . " " Why do you say quondam ? " asked Yolanda . " Mr. Van Dyck is still my fiance . " " You mean  --  after all that went on in that closet ? " " Would one of you mind taking a look at this arm ? " Peter edged in weakly . " Just a minute , " retorted Yolanda . " What did happen in that closet , now that this woman has brought up the subject ? I insist on knowing . " pI09 " In detail ? " Jo inquired . " Do n't be common , " snapped Yolanda . " I demand a plain statement from Mr. Van Dyck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her charming shoulders , " we might as well confess , Peter . " She turned to the waiting girl and extended her outspread hands in a helpless gesture . " The usual thing , " she said . You know  --  the usual thing . " " I think I do know , " replied the other , " but I certainly did not know it was the usual thing . Is she speaking the truth , Peter ? " " Well , did n't you see for yourself ? " Jo cried in exasperation . " He was as naked as a coot , was n't he ? What else but the usual thing ? " " It might be usual with you , " said Yolanda , " but I did n't pink it was with Mr. Van Dyck  --  especially in a closet . Is it , Peter ? " " Eh ? " asked Peter . " What 's that ? Oh , no . Certainly not . Most unusual in a closet  --  almost unthinkable . " " There you are , " said Josephine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unusual , but only in a closet , mind you . " " I want to sit down , " said Peter . " Are n't either one of you ping to do a thing about this arm ? " " I 'll look after you in a minute , Peter , " Yolanda told " No , you wo n't , " said Josephine . " After all that has passed between us , that is my privilege . " " My dear young woman , " replied Yolanda , " you have no official standing . " " I can hardly stand at all , " said Peter . " I 'm going to sit down before I fall down . " Finding a place on the long seat , he sank wearily down ide a stout , neatly arrayed woman with an anticipatory pression in her eyes . Although Peter did not know it atmoment , this woman was thinking entirely in terms ofpIIObeer . So engrossed had she been in her thoughts , so spiritually steeped in beer , as it were , she had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nose its way across the fogpiledriver . Beneath her breath the woman had been humming " California , Here I Come "  --  an old favorite with Aspirin Liz . Peter 's near collapse on the bench beside her drew the thoughts of the bemused woman back to her present surroundings , which were not nearly so congenial as those of a waterfront cafe . She gave the wounded man a quick survey , then turned halfway round on the bench and faced him . Her eyes were fixed on the dark , moist stain on his sleeve . Liz promptly drew the logical inference . Here was a wounded gunman who with the invariable delicacy of his kind refrained from drawing attention to his little contretemps . From the appearance of this gunman , racketeer , gangster , or whatever his class or creed , Aspirin Liz concluded that his present contretemps was something more than a little . The man looked downright bad . Aspirin Liz , with the quick comradery of her training , was worried about him . " In trouble ? " she asked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement to guilt . " Yes , " he muttered . " Terrible trouble . Shot in the arm . " " Are you asking for a shot in the arm ? " Liz asked him . " Or have you been shot in the arm ? " " Yes , " said Peter . " I 've been . Never take dope . " " Good , " replied Liz . " That 's one thing you 've missed , anyway . " " What do you mean ? " demanded Peter . " Did you take me for a dope fiend ? " " Never can tell , " said Liz . " Ought to do something about that arm . " " What should I do about it ? " asked Peter . A SHOT IN THE ARM III " Take it out of its coat sleeve and shirt , for one thing , then take a look at it . " " In front of all these people ? " " Why not ? Never been in your shirtsleeves before ? " " Much less than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours . " You might not believe me , madam , but I 've been dashing about naked . " Liz 's opinion of the man underwent a quick change . " Oh , I see , " she said . " That explains it . Then you 're not a gangster ? " " Certainly not ! " indignantly . " Sort of shot in the line of nobody 's business , " said Liz . " In the pursuit of pleasure , so to speak . Are all husbands born with Bats ? Come on . Off with that coat . " " It was n't that , " complained Peter as she helped him to Slip out of his coat . " Not what you mean at all . " Josephine and Yolanda , having succeeded in giving each other thoroughly bad tempers , presented themselves before peter at this moment . " What did I tell you ? " demanded Jo , pointing a finger at peter . " There he goes again . Getting undressed already , and I bet he has n't known the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Peter . " You 'd rather let me bleed to death than stop telling lies . " " I see you brought your trouble with you , " observed Liz in level tones . " Those two your molls ? " " Not both of us , " said Jo promptly , with a nod indicating Yolanda . " She is . I 'm just his fancy lady . " " What am I ? " Yolanda demanded . " It does n't matter , " replied Aspirin Liz with an amused pnile . " I do n't care if you 're a couple of nuns . This man 's born wounded . You can wash your dirty linen later . " " Dirty linen ! " put in Yolanda disdainfully . " Peter , am I So be insulted in your presence ? " pII2 " Yes , " said Peter , disgusted . " You are . I 'd like to do it myself . " " You have , " replied Yolanda . " And speaking about linen , " Jo tossed in , " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this . " That , " continued the girl , " should be enough to convince you of the irregularity of our relations . They 're not linen , his drawers . They 're silk  --  all silk with orange stripes . Look for yourself , if you do n't believe me . " " Is that true , Peter ? " Yolanda demanded . " Oh , I do n't know , " he answered distractedly , flinching beneath the investigating hands of Liz . " Maybe she does and maybe she does n't . I forget myself . Why do n't you drag my trousers off and get my damned drawers witnessed by a notary public ? " " Apparently , " remarked Yolanda , " you do n't care what woman undresses you so long as you get undressed . " " No , " gritted Peter . " I like myself that way . " At this moment an impressive gentleman in clerical attire introduced himself to the contentious group . " I was told a passenger had been shot , " he began as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any help ? " " Well , " Jo replied , favoring the Bishop with a glowing smile , " he 's not quite ready to be buried yet , but if this boat does n't land somewhere soon you may have the pleasure of chucking him out at sea . " Bishop Waller permitted himself a faint smile , then stooped over and examined Peter 's arm while Aspirin Liz looked at him with respect bred of the awareness of a slightly dappled past . Soon the two of them were working in completeaccord to staunch the wound and bandage it , Liz acting in the capacity of water carrier to the man of God . When it came to procuring a bandage she promptly solved the difficultywith a coy look at the Bishop . " I can see those two ladies do n't wear them , " she saidp113reprovingly , " but I do and always have and always will . Here goes . " Turning her back on the Bishop , who in justice to his exalted spirit was not at all interested , she did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquiring scrutiny of several dozen passengers who sat patiently following her movements with the dull curiosity of accepted with a word of dignified commendation , then bound Peter 's arm . " Under the circumstances , " he said when his task was finished , " this is about the best we can do , but the moment you get ashore , sir , I strongly advise you to see a physician to guard against infection . May I ask how the unfortunate accident occurred ? " " Merely one of the commoner risks of contemporary life in America , " said Peter . " A stray shot , you know . " " Exactly , " replied the Bishop . " Today one can hardly telephonewithout having the booth shot from around one . " He seated himself beside Peter with the air of a man both able and willing to watch the whole night through . " Most people in telephone booths deserve to be shot , " Josephine declared . " It 's the only way you can get ' em to come out . " Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had frequently felt that way himselfabout people in telephone booths , but had never gone so far as to put his feelings into words . " Of course , " he said judicially , " one 's attitude may change considerably according to whether one is doing the telephoningor the shooting . " " That 's so , " replied Jo . " Had n't thought of that . " The Bishop 's smile embraced her . " Of course , my dear , " he said . " Such minor considerations escape us all at times . "  |p114Hardly  had the Bishop rounded off his sentence as such gentlemen will and must , when the ferryboat fairly tore its heart out in a protesting blast against fate in the guise of fog . As the engines sent chills along its timbers the reversed propellers bit back into the hidden water . From dead ahead came the answering scream of a half-crazed whistle . Danger ten feet off . Passengers ran to look at it , faces pressed against the windows . Eyes too filled with the wonder of ignorance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting smoothly . . . then a soft , silly bump , a mere touch in the fog . " Well , your reverence , " said Aspirin Liz , " there 's one of those minor considerations we did n't quite escape . " " Bishop Waller , madam , " the excellent man informed her calmly . " Episcopal bishop of the Eastern States . And should this present consideration prove a little less minor than we would like it , let us face it with the fortitude and courage of true Christians  --  civilized Christians , that is . " Even at this serious moment Bishop Waller insisted on stressing that nice distinction existing between civilized Christians and savage ones  --  those who always wore drawers and those who gleefully discarded them after the closing hymn . A small figure between two suitcases was taking up a great deal of room as it staggered across the cabin towards Peter Van Dyck . " Here 's your bags , mister , " gasped the pickpocket , supportinghimself between them . " Thank you , Little Arthur , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy to dress before sinking , I fear . " " Are we doing that ? " the small man asked in an even smaller voice . " You had best prepare yourself to meet your God either now or a little later , " Bishop Waller told the pickpocket in a gentle voice.  | " If you do n't mind , your honor , " Little Arthur chattered , " I 'm going to pray to God to meet Him much later  --  with all due respect to Heaven and Himself . " " You 'll never meet Him at all , you thing ! " Josephine assured him . " Peter , please do something , " Yolanda burst out . " My nerves are on an edge . " " Do n't worry , " said Liz brightly . " They might be all wet , you know . " " Ugh ! " gasped Little Arthur . " What are we going to do ? " Then a great voice drilling down through the fog toldLittle Arthur in no uncertain language exactly what to do.  |p116Bad  Talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU BOOBY ! " BOOMED OUT the great voice , making an unpleasant evening even more unpleasant . I16pI17 " Seafaring men have such unbridled tempers , " mildly observedthe Bishop . " I 'd hate to be called a booby even in a fog , " Peter declared . " It 's a word to which I strongly object . Seems to strike at the very roots of one 's being . " Apparently the skipper felt the same way about it . " Who the hell are you calling booby ? " he cried from the hidden aloofness of his little pilot house . " I 'm calling you a booby , " answered the other skipper across the milling fog . " You 're a booby yourself , " retorted the defender of the ferryboat , seeing no reason to improve on the word . " A blundering booby at that . " " Call me a booby ! " almost screamed the other voice . " I 'd like to cut you in two . What do you mean running into an ocean liner , endangering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by picking on a ferryboat carrying American citizens ? " demanded the local skipper , introducing an international flavor to the dispute . " Your passengers do n't count for a damn , " he was informed . " They 're dirty commuters . They are n't even human . " " Is that so ? Well , so are yours . You 're all boobies  --  the lot of you . " A clatter of protesting voices burst through the fog . One shrill , ironical voice made itself disagreeably articulate . " You can drown commuters by the handful , " announced this voice , " and the world would be better off  --  much better off . " This time the commuters ' voices shattered the fog with indignant discord . " Your passengers are a lot of pleasure-loving swine , " ' creamed the skipper of the ferry , his voice rising above the disgraceful din.  | " Will you keep that rabble quiet ? " came the voice of the liner 's skipper . " Ca n't hear a word you say . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft 's skipper . " Why do n't you fumigate ' em ? " The reception of this crude suggestion by the passengers of the liner was deafening . Obviously they were infuriated far beyond the bounds of good taste . The ferryboat jeered triumphantly , and the word " immigrants " found immediate favor , also such terms of endearment as wops , kikes , bolshies , anarchists , reds , and a few others that will not bear repetition . In the midst of this hubbub the voices of the two skippers could be distinguished passionately cursing the passengersthey had so recently been defending . Gradually the voices died exhaustedly away so that the respective representatives of the opposing ships were enabled to continue insultingeach other in comparative peace and quiet . " An edifying way for ships to act , " observed Peter , " when fogbound far at sea . " " If you do n't take that waterlogged louse of yours away from my ship I 'm going to run you down , " the voice from the liner shouted . " I 've got a peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hell , " the ferryboat replied . Upon hearing this , the peace delegation apparently became so warlike it had to be roundly cursed back into silence . Aspirin Liz , with the light of battle in her eyes and closely supported by a quivering Josephine , made for the head of the ferry . The others followed the two women . " Go to hell , you ! " shouted Aspirin Liz as soon as she had taken up her station . " We 've got a bishop of the Episcopal Church on our boat and if you do n't believe that his name 's Waller . " " My dear ! My dear ! " protested the Bishop . " Do n't use my name in all this fog . " " What 's wrong with your name ? " snapped Jo , thenp119shrieked through her hands at the opposing ship . " His name is Waller  --  Bishop Waller . Never heard of Bishop Waller , you big stiff ? " " I 'm doing the shouting , lady , " the ferryboat 's captain called down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's the twelve apostles , " the seafaringskipper blasphemously retorted . " Go tell him to wailer in the waves . That 's where he 'll soon be and you , too , you Jersey broad . " " My God ! He called me a broad ! " cried Josephine , white with rage , then furiously to the fog , " Shut up , you lily . " " What ! " screamed back the fog . " Me , a lily ! I 'd like to come down there and punch you on the nose . " " A most violent character , " objected the Bishop ; then , suddenly losing his ecclesiastical calm : " Take your vile craft out of the way , you zany , and let God-fearing people proreedin peace . " " Yes , " yelled Aspirin Liz . " Get a move on . I want some beer . " " Who the hell cares about you and your beer ? " the liner flung back coarsely . " All you 'll get is salt water and lots of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily ! " sang out Jo . " Think up another name . " " Oh , my God , " came the voice of the distracted skipper , and Peter in his mind 's eye caught a glimpse of weatherbeatenfeatures distorted with impotent rage . " Oh , my God , " came the strangled voice . " If I could only come down there and pull your nose . " " Oh , my dear , how vicious ! " Josephine tossed back girlishly . " We 're thumbing our noses at you , in case you ca n't see us . " " Make that woman stop , " called the liner 's captain , appealingdirectly to the commander of the ferryboat . " Byrights she should be put in irons for calling me such names . " " Oh , you lily ! " yodeled a chorus of voices through the fog , a group of truck drivers seeming to be especially gifted at this form of derision . " You 're forgetting to sound your whistle , sir , " the local skipper pleasantly reminded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll report that little neglect of duty . " " I 'm forgetting I 'm a human being , " the voice came back wildly from the liner . " I 'm forgetting I 'm an officer and a gentleman . I 'm forgetting I 've got a soul . " The last word rose in a howl . " I 'm mad . I 'm going mad , I tell you , " it resumed . " Going mad alone in the fog . " A burst of maniacal laughter followed , then a snatch of demented song . " All alone on the telephone , " quavered the voice of the liner 's skipper . " Sleep , sailor , sleep all alone on the telephone  --  ha , ha , ha ! " The climax was a volley of incoherent obscenities , which ceased suddenly as a new voice was heard , a quiet , reasonable , cultured voice . " Sorry , " this voice sang out , " but our skipper has just lost his reason or had a stroke or something . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too bad about your old man , " answered the ferryboat captain . " Merely having a bit of a jaw-back . I swear to God I do n't know where we can be . " " Might be off the old Rock herself for all I know , " the other replied hopelessly . " Sounds like open water to me . " " Are you anchored ? " asked the ferry captain . " Been anchored for hours , " he was told . " Well , I have n't got any anchors , " declared the skipper of the ferry . " Wish you had one round your neck , " a vulgar voice observed weightily , " an ' that you was right with it forty fathoms deep . " " Pipe down , there ! " cried the cultured voice . " I say , Captail , would you care to tie up ' longside of me ? " " No , thanks , " replied the other . " I 'll go smousing round for a bit yet . Might find something . Hope the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for me , " Little Arthur surprisingly shouted , " a ocean-going liner should n't have a weak-minded skipper . " " Shut up , you worm ! " snapped Jo . " You would pull a wisecrack just when we were getting nice and friendly . Do n't you realize you are n't good enough to insult even a body-snatcher ? " If the skipper of the liner had been incapacitated , his passengersstill remained loyal . As the two ships parted company in the fog their insults fell thick and fast . The ferryboat did not remain silent . Foul words and frantic filled the air . " If an angel should appear now , " remarked the Bishop with a sigh of regret , " I very much fear he would mistake the earth for a region far below . These maddened voices in the fog sound like spirits in torment . " " How long have we been afloat ? " Peter asked a little wearily . " Nearly two and a half hours , " replied the Bishop glanc-g at his watch . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not interested , " Jo retorted , then considered him with sudden interest . " Come here , Little Arthur , " she said at Litt in a dangerously honeyed voice . " I want to have a friendly talk with you . " " Are you sure it 's friendly ? " he asked with justifiable susion . " I 've had more than enough trouble for one day . " " There 's not going to be any trouble , " Josephine assured n . " You 're going to like this . " or a few moments they conversed earnestly together ; n , with a backward glance at the others , wandered incntlyoff in the direction of several trucks hunched in the m of the traffic alleys filled with fog and the fumes of . Peter and his companions returned to the relative cour-t of the cabin . A trifle depressed after the excitement used by the recent encounters , they sat down and con-. stinted the faces of their fellow passengers . Those faces werepI22 a study in conflicting emotions . They furnished ample food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperatingconditions . Peter 's brain was working dreamily on the borderland of sleep . His head felt hot and heavy . There was a throbbing pain in his arm . So many interrupted lives , he mused . So many routines broken . Wives waiting all over New Jersey . Dinners getting cold . Children staying up for Daddy , then going to bed withouthim . Mothers glancing out of windows and running to front doors . Little speeches of greeting being rehearsed . Furious little speeches  --  perfect gems of sarcasm and sweet recrimination . " No , dear . Little Junior could n't wait up until dawn . Sorry , but if you must stop off at a speakeasy , you 'll have to do without your son . Of course , it does n't matter about me . I have n't counted in years . Do you find it close in here , dear ? I 'll open up all the windows so the neighbors can enjoy your breath , too . No . Do n't try to get around me . Keep your horrid hands off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to prefer their company to mine . " Peter 's thoughts veered off at another tangent . He was convinced that the little chap with the pinched face across the way was making up a lie already . Years of experience had taught the man that his wife would never believe the truth . He must perjure his soul to keep peace in the family . He must tell a lie to give her the pleasure of catching him in it . If he told the truth and stuck to it , the lady would feel herselfinjured . She always felt injured . She was born with an ax to grind with life in general , and he had been feeling its blade for years until he was chipped away to his spiritless soul . That quiet-looking fellow a few seats away seemed actually to be enjoying the situation . He was probably welcoming this fogbound interlude in his unadventurous days . Doubtlesswished the ferryboat would never find its rightful slip . Peter felt that the man hated that ferry slip , had been hatingpI23it night after night , week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was popular when life was unable to dig up anythingbetter than a couple of ferry slips with uncongenial destinations at either end . But there was a person eager to get home . Newly married , Peter placed him . Probably a baby on the way . No word from his wife for twelve whole hours . The poor devil was too nervous to sit down . Kept walking about and doing silly things with his hands . Aimless things  --  futile gestures . And all because some unremarkable girl in some equally unremarkabletown in New Jersey was about to add her even more unremarkable contribution to an already overcrowded world . But none of it seemed unremarkable to this young fellow . Neither the town nor the girl nor the baby . Life for him was touched with wonder . For him there was a zest in things . Peter decided that if he had the chap in his office , he would give him a worth-while raise . There was a pretty girl who had had about enough of fog horns for one night . Probably worked in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long . Some day she would probably contribute to the world 's population . Funny thing , that . She would grow old and change and look different , and years from now another girl looking not unlike her would come there and sit in that same seat . And the whole thing would begin over again . Just like a picture with the same picture in it and the same one in that , only a little smaller , going on forever . Peter wondered drowsily if he were growing a little delirious . Snatches of conversation kept getting mixed up in his mind . Why was he leading these people 's lives for them , herring the things they said , imagining their thoughts ? The world was being eaten up by fog and driven mad by fog horns . A detective story would go well now . Somebody should be murdered . Somebody almost had been murdered . A few inches to the right with that bullet , and he would notpI24 have cared whether the boat made land or not . Where would he be now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice to the whistles ? That girl down the line  --  what was her trouble ? Why that bitter expression ? She was getting along in years now . Already that deadly look of efficiency , that expression of command , was stealing into her face . Perhaps she had passed up a date to spend the week-end somewhere with her boss . Maybe her last chance  --  her last chance to find out about a lot of things , to experience a lot of things . When she reached home tonight  --  if she ever did  --  two old people would be waiting there for her . A little worried always . Always a little fearful . Something might happen to this girl of theirs , this girl growing old like themselves , yet still almost as inexperiencedas the day when she was born . Family loyalty and self-sacrifice could be carried too far . Always was . This girl would never add to the world 's population , and she damn well should . Someone should seduce her  --  make a mother out of her , give her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but then there was always someone . Peter 's brain was once more snatching conversations from the air  --  Hello , J. B. How 's tricks ? Reached your quota yet ? He 's a **26;1410;TOOLONG man . Must be a nice guy . Thought you always rode up with another party  --  tall , dark feller . Usually do . He 's a **30;1438;TOOLONG man . Must be a wonderful guy . The little lady all right ? Nervous  --  this depression . Have to send her to Lakewood . Mine , too . Got to pack her off . Women ca n't stand depression . Nobody can . Depression 's bad for the country . That 's what I say . See that guy over there ? He 's a **29;1470;TOOLONG . Must be a washout . Where does he get off to carry a cane ? There 's a pip  --  what a leg ! Know her ? Oh , you do  --  any good ? I should tell you . Hoover 's a gentleman , at any rate , not a goddam red . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pete . Been punching my ticket forpI25the past seventeen years . Got a piece I want to read . Bedtime stories ? Right . Tell ' em to the kiddies . Nothing like kiddies . She has got a swell leg . The synthetic snatches faded away . Peter 's head sank rower and lower . Aspirin Liz collected it and propped her wellpaddedshoulder against his cheek . Close to the surface of consciousness Peter slid along through the fog . In the meantime Joe and Little Arthur were lurking round the trucks like wolves round a wagon train . They were inspectingthe trucks with careless-seeming yet calculating eyes . Each truck was wondered about , each truck peeped into , poked and felt . Their hands were furtively caressing . Little Arthur 's favorite truck gave promise of fancy groceries . He opened a knife in his pocket , looked quickly about him , then operated on the truck with the skill of a surgeon on a mere appendix . Jo 's hands were darting into another truck . Jo believed in bread . She succeeded in snatching cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver . Little did . Joe care whose personal property it was . She had to provide for her own . " This is the first time I ever stole a chicken , " Little Arthur whispered , pointing to a bulge in his coat . " Put it back ! " said Jo . " Put it back . The damn thing will quawk all over the ferry . " " It ai n't that kind of a chicken . " " Mean it 's a dumb chicken ? " " No , it 's a dead chicken . " " But raw ? " asked Jo . " Very , " admitted the crook . " Cold and raw . " Jo thought rapidly but effectively . " Come , " she said at last . " There must be a fire in the engine room . We 'll borrow a chunk of the ship 's fire , but listen , Little Arthur , let me do the talking . " " Do n't I know ! " the little chap replied . " I 'd never try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thief , " said Jo almost tenderly . A few minutes later some passengers were slightly interested in seeing two figures , crouched as if in pain , move swiftly to the small door of the engine room and neatly disappearbehind it . Jo descended a short steep metal ladder , regretting the while the absence of an audience below . She felt sure that had the engineer been present he would have granted her every wish . Men were like that  --  foolish . A blackened face seated on a box rolled two white eyes at her from behind a stanchion . " Hello ! " said the face . " What 's up ? " " Nothing much , " replied Jo easily . " I 'm the daughter of a ship 's captain myself . " " I 'm not a ship 's captain , lady , " the face replied , " much less his daughter . " " Do n't be silly , " said Jo . " I want to cook a chicken . " " Oh , yeah ? " the face grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that the bird you want to cook ? " The face pointed at Little Arthur . " No , " said Jo . " Hell is n't hot enough for that one . " " It 's too noisy here , " the dip complained . " What do you want to do ? " asked Jo . " Sing ? " " No . It hurts my ears . " Jo turned away from Little Arthur and considered a small black door , through the edges of which gleamed a frame of fire . " Might cook it in there , " she remarked . " To a cinder , " grinned the man . " Might fix something up . " " Sure , lady . What do you think this is , the Ritz ? " " Slip me that chicken , " said Jo . Arthur produced the chicken as a magician produces a rabbit and handed it to Jo , who in turn passed it to the man with the black face . " Pretty slick chicken , that , " allowed Jo.  |p127When  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a good chicken , " he agreed , holding it out to Jo . " I do n't want it , " she told him . " Put it on some fire . " " Listen , lady , are you nuts ? " the man asked . " Certainly not , " the girl replied . " Why ? " " Nothing , " said the man . " Only I was afraid you figured yourself home in your own kitchen and had mistaken me for your cook . " " You do n't look a bit like my cook , " said Jo . " You 're much nicer . " " Come on , quit your kidding ! " The man looked pleased . " Ca n't you cram it into some fire ? " asked Jo . The man looked at her and grinned . Then he spat copiously . After that he got up . " You 're a funny sketch , " he said at last . " This chicken all ready ? " " Do n't know , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You look at it . " The man thereupon elevated the chicken and sighted through it , one white eye professionally closed . It was not a nice scene to witness under the most favorable conditions , but in that engine room and done by a man with a black face it was almost more than Little Arthur could bear . He closed both his eyes . " What do you see ? " the girl asked breathlessly . " Wish I could see land , " said the man . " We seem to have t that . Even the fog horns are getting scarcer , but I 'll .. , k your chicken for you , lady . " ' Chat 's swell , " said Jo . " You 're a good egg , chief . I 've a sick man up there . He 's been shot . " " Heard about that guy , " the chief replied as he movedsearchingly about the confined area . " Sort of queer thing , that . And all the time there 's some man sitting quietly onis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shows. pI28You never can tell . Who 'd ever thought I 'd be cooking a chicken in a fog ? " " Ai n't he even going ter wash it ? " asked Little Arthur . " What for ? " asked Jo . " We 'll burn the dirt off . " Little Arthur shrank even smaller . " Always like my chickens washed , " he muttered . The black-faced man had found what he wanted . It was a pan  --  a large pan . This he filled with glowing coals upon which he placed another and smaller pan . " Ask him to dust the ashes out , " urged Little Arthur . " Will you be quiet ! " said Jo , who was by now greatly interested . From a suspicious-looking can the chief poured some water into the smaller pan , plopped the chicken in it , then covered the whole affair with a galvanized washtub . " Would n't want no better oven than that , " he remarked , surveying his rude creation . " Who would n't ? " muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jo admiringly . " Have a hunk of cake . " She produced a box of cake from beneath the duster she had managed to retain and tore off the cover . " Just a little , " said the chief . " Go on . Take a lot . " He accepted the cake and munched . " Good cake , " he observed . " I like cake . You know  --  good cake . " Little Arthur decided that here was a man who would be at home in any surroundings . He was the same as a dog or any other animal . His reactions were the simple ones of the brute . The girl was like him . Little Arthur , to show how much nicer he was than his companions , produced his knife and cut himself a slice of cake . " Nice , ai n't it ? " said the chief , rolling his eyes at the little man . " Orange icing 's good . " pI29Little Arthur waited until his mouth was clear , then spoke with marked distinctness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's sticking on your chin . " " What ? " asked the black faced man . " The crumbs , " said Little Arthur . The man once more laughed coarsely . " If that 's all , " he got out . " Bah ! " " That 's not all , " replied Little Arthur meticulously . " There 's bits of waste and coal dust and oil . " " I guess that chin can stand it , " the man remarked , not even taking the trouble to wipe his chin . " No doubt , " agreed the pickpocket , " but I almost ca n't . " " What do you mean ? " the other demanded truculently . " Oh , nothing , " said Little Arthur , " only there 's a lady resent and you ai n't doing yourself justice with that chin . Looks like an ashcan , it does . " " Oh , all right , " the chief grumbled , looking furtively at osephine , now seated on the box by the chicken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a wad of waste from his pocket and drew it across his chin . " ' That makes your chin look better , " said Arthur , " and the rest of your face worse . " " Do n't mind him , " Jo put in . " I like your face as it is. is take a look at the chicken . " With a steel rod the man raised the washtub . Three pairs of eyes were fastened on the chicken . " Smells good , " said the man . " She 'll be done pretty soon flow  --  sooner than in a regular oven . " She was . The chicken was done , or partly done , in a surprisinglyshort time . The man with the face refused . " No , thank you , lady , " he protested . " I put on the feed bag before we shoved off . Take her up to your young man wit h the compliments of the chef . "  |p130For  some reason Jo blushed . She realized she was blushing , and that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never thought of herself as having a young man . With her it had always been grabbing off a guy or being grabbed herself . She had never had a real , acknowledgedyoung man for herself . Hers had been the easy-come , easy-go type . For a moment she caught a mental image of Peter 's pale , bony face with its sardonically set mouth and mild blue eyes full of vagrant fancies . God knows what he actually thought of her . She had not tried to show herself in an any too favorable light . Making herself impudent and more than plenty tough . True , he was n't quite a young man , but then she did not care much for that sort . There and then amid the smells and grime of the ship 's clanking bowels she knew that Peter meant much to her and that she was going to make herself mean even more to Peter in spite of all the Yolanda Wilmonts in the world . But perhaps he was dead by now . She had forgotten about his wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out a hand to his . " Got to hurry . Grab that bird , Little Arthur , and come right along . " " Here , " said the man with the black face , producing a thick cup , and tipping the gravy from the pan into it . " Here . Might as well take this along . It 'll strengthen the young feller up . " " God bless your black face , chief , " said the girl as she turned to the ladder . " You 're white , clean white inside . " " I know that poem , too , " cried the man , as if someone had touched a button somewhere concealed about him . " I can say it all by heart . " " Wish he had n't said that , " thought Josephine as she toiled up the ladder . " If Peter knows that poem I 'll eat this chicken myself and throw the bones in his face.  |p131Dinner  Is Served " LISTEN , PETER , " SAID JO A FEW MINUTES LATER . " DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wince . His arm was bad . Little flames of pain licking stiff flesh.  | " What 's that ? " he asked , blinking at the girl . " Do I know any what ? " " Poetry , " said Jo . " You know . Like Milton or Ogden Nash ? " " I ca n't quote a line written by either gentleman , " Peter told her . " Did you wake me up with the weird hope that I 'd say little pieces for you ? " " No , " went on Jo , " but if you 're sure you do n't know any poetry and you swear never to learn any , I 'll give you a cup of chicken soup and a chunk of the chicken from which it oozed . " " I do n't know any poetry and I never will , " said Peter in a disgusted voice . " I do n't feel at all like poetry unless it 's composed entirely of bad words . " " Good ! " exclaimed Jo , then hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know anything about the mighty God that made you and you 're white , clean white , inside ? " she asked , watching his face anxiously . " No , " said Peter , " and I doubt very much if I am . Got a lot of different colors inside . So have you . " . " Let 's not go into that , " Jo hastily put in . " Here take this soup and get that inside . Little Arthur , break out your magic knife and carve that ruddy chicken . I 've got some cake and a small ration of coffee . " She produced the cake and thermos bottle . Little Arthur placed the chicken between Aspirin Liz and the Bishop , then attacked it with his invaluable knife . Peter sat drinkingan exceedingly pungent liquid which was nearer to chicken grease than chicken soup . However , it was hot and had food value in it . The other passengers looked on with expressions ranging from greed and envy to revulsion borderingon nausea . The little group , through lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rough in its dealings with the chicken . Even Bishop Waller went at his section with tooth and nail . Yolanda strove to be daintyp133about it and nearly lost her share as a consequence . Soon she was gnashing away as cheerfully as the rest of them . " My dear , " said Bishop Waller after his portion had disappeared into the pontifical belly , " my dear young lady , how did you manage the chicken , may I ask ? " " We stole him or her , " Josephine replied . " Little Arthur and I. " The good Bishop thought this over with a slight frown on his fine face . At last his expression cleared , and he favored Jo with a smile . " I am glad I asked that question after rather than before eating , " he admitted with happy sophistry . " It was a delicious chicken in spite of the irregular circumstances surrounding Its getting . But perhaps the less said the easier digested . " " Was it already cooked ? " asked Aspirin Liz . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down in the engine room . There 's the sweetest man there with a dirty black face and grimy hands . He helped us cook it . " " Oh , dear ! " murmured Yolanda , looking as if she had been poisoned . " A dirty black man ! " " Only his hands and face , " Jo protested . " Do n't know  --  bout the rest of his body . May have been as white as yours , if that 's saying anything . " " It 's saying too much , " Yolanda retorted . " What did you cook it in ? " " A couple of old ashpans , " Jo informed her . " My word ! " said Yolanda , looking at the others with round eyes . " Think what we have inside us besides chicken ! " " A lot of satisfaction , " Peter put in , " where before there Was nothing but craving . Good work , Jo ! Our tame thief is a credit to his profession . " " May I ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to this seemingly harmless little chap as being a thief and a criminal ? " " Because he is , " Jo answered proudly . " A regular thief . "  | " Only a pickpocket , yer honor , " Little Arthur protested . " Just pockets , yer know . Little pockets . Never much in ' em . " " But you take what little there is , do n't you , Little Arthur ? " Jo insisted . " Nobody ever minds much , " he answered . " Nobody has much these days to mind , " Aspirin Liz observed . " You 'll have better and bigger pockets to pick before you die , Little Arthur . " " I 'm thinking of giving it up , " he declared . " Now that I 've met a holy man  --  a real , live bishop , that is . " " Splendid , Little Arthur ! Splendid ! " cried the Bishop . " I 'm gratified my presence has done some good . You might celebrate your career of regeneration by returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for the time out there on deck . I 've been wondering which of you had it . " " Honest , " said Little Arthur , producing the watch from a side pocket , " that watch had just gone clean out of my mind . " " Very little can go clean out of your mind , " Aspirin Liz assured him . " Honest , now , " the small crook repeated . " Honest . I mean it . The Bishop should n't take out a valuable watch like that in a lot of wet fog . It 's fairly criminal , it is . He 'll spoil it . " " It was most unwise , I 'll admit , with you around , " said the Bishop with a benevolent smile as he courteously accepted the watch . " However , all 's well that ends well . ' We 'll say no more about it . " " Thank you , yer honor , " said Little Arthur gratefully . " Your extensive acquaintance with judges , I imagine , has led you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not judge men professionally , Little Arthur . Rather , I endeavor to save them . Privately , I have my own opinions which , I am sorry to say , are not high  --  far , far from high . I am not yourp135honor . ' If you insist on a title I might bear up beneath the weight of your reverence . ' " " Thank you , yer reverence , " said Little Arthur . " Nicesoundingname , that  --  yer reverence . Never liked yer honor ' much . Always meant worry and trouble and a lot of " Lying , " Jo helpfully supplied . A large , rough-looking person wearing a strangely ingratiatingsmile had been standing for some minutes gazing down from his impressive height upon the remains of the chicken . It speaks well for Josephine Duval 's character that she never suspected anyone of being really bad at heart save herself , and she rarely if ever thought much about that . A few other passengers had gathered unobtrusively round the outskirts of the large , rough-looking man . " Young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respectful admiration , " that was a mighty slick trick you did with that chicken . How did you manage to work it , if I may be so bold ? " Flushed with triumph , Jo turned to one whom she fondly believed to be her latest conquest . " You 're right it was a slick trick , " she told him . " When it comes to the survival of the fittest you ca n't afford to stand on ceremony . " " I should say not , " the man replied , a little overenthusiastically . " What did you do , miss ? Let me in on it . " " What did I do ? Why , I helped myself , of course , " she asserted . " And this little beggar helped me . " " I found it , " Little Arthur proudly declared . " Oh , " said the man , beaming so energetically he looked as If he were going to explode . " So you found it . Now that is good . " His voice dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it , miss ? " he asked . " That would be telling , " Josephine hedged . " Go on , miss , " the great man almost whined . " Why not toll us ? We 're all hungry , too  --  like yourselves . "  | " I suspect the integrity of that large individual 's motives , " Bishop Waller murmured to Peter . " There 's an air about him , " agreed Peter . " A faint suggestion of menace . " Jo looked undecidedly at the man for a moment , then her impressionable French heart melted . Besides , it would cost her nothing . Furthermore , she decided , when a man as big as this one got hungry all over he was a danger to his fellow men until glutted with food . " Well , I 'll tell you , " she began . " There 's a boob of a truckmanaboard this ferry A spasm of terrific emotion passed over the great man 's face . " Yes , miss , " he broke in , his voice trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said a boob of a truckman . Hear that , everybody . Ha , ha ! A boob of a truckman ! That 's good ! Oh , that 's very good ! " Pleased by the reception of her words , Josephine endeavoredto better them . " Yes , " she continued , " a regular boob of a truckman . Must be a poor fish " Ha ! " cried the great man . " A poor fish , eh ? So he 's a poor fish no less than a boob ? " Jo nodded quite seriously . " Yes , " she said . " Do you know what he did , the sap-head ? " " What did he do , lady ? " the man whispered , as if he were having trouble with his throat . " Tell us what the sap-head did . " " Why , he left his truck unguarded , " replied Jo . " That 's what the sap-head did  --  just strolled off and left his truck flat . " " And what did you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " broke in Bishop Waller , " I strongly advise against any further exchange of confidences . "  |p137But  the Bishop 's cautious admonition came too late . Jo was in full cry . " What did we do ? " replied the girl . " Why , naturally , we helped ourselves . Little Arthur there yanked out his knife , cut a hole through the canvas covering , and reached out a chicken just as easy as taking a rabbit from a hat . And the funny part of it is the half-wit who 's driving the truck is n't any the wiser yet . When he discovers that hole I 'd like to take a look at his face . " An amazing transformation had taken place in the great man 's features . They were congealed now in an expression of superhuman malevolence in which a smile of tremendous bitterness cracked about his bared teeth . Outside of the movies Jo had never seen such a face , such an evil , sadistic mask . The man was wheezing as if someone had kicked him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he gasped ; then , squatting with surprising agility , he flung out : " Then take a good look at it . This is his face , see  --  the boob 's face , the face of the poor fish  --  the  --  the  --  the  --  " his voice broke in a sob of rage  --  " the face of the sap-head . Take a good look at it . " But Jo had looked at the man 's face once , and it was the last thing in the world she wanted to do again . It was nothing to see , that face . As a matter of fact it was too much to , see . The girl closed her eyes , but that awful face still hung suspended in her memory . Then the face moved and brought its baleful influence directly to bear on Little Arthur , who recoiled in mortal terror . Still squatting and with hands extended , their fingers suggestively working , the owner of the lace drew near to Little Arthur . In a surprisingly short space of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal as well as rear end at a high rate of speed . With an effect of complete finality the small man made alarge noise as he hit the deck and remained very muchthere.  |p138Then  , as if what had already occurred had not been sufficientlysurprising , an even more surprising element literally mingled itself with the situation . Before the great face had time to pick up Little Arthur and do some more things with him , Bishop Waller , with a roar of righteous indignation , launched himself in defense of his so recently acquired convert . It was a magnificent and inspiring spectacle . It became even more stupendous when the bared ecclesiastical head establishedresounding contact with the ungodly abdomen of the truckman and sent him crashing to the planks . Outside , the fog horn told the fog what the ferryboat thought of it , waves splashed against the sides , and ghostly voices drifted past , but within the cozy cabin the trackman lay stunned while Josephine and Aspirin Liz took up positions and stood waiting for the kill . In the meantime the highly edified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive his truck to its destination , made a general movement in its direction . One can gain no true conception of the rugged determination of commuters , of their resource and clever teamwork , until one has witnessed them in concerted action . Respectable husbands and fathers  --  not to mention business executives , clerks , and stenographers  --  literally swarmed all over the truck . Men accustomed to the feel of golf clubs now swung chickens aloft with equal dexterity . The backbone of the nation was looking for its grub and finding it in lavish quantities . Presently other trucks were attacked by fresh detachments of commutersunable to find standing room on the original one . Everyone seemed to have entered into the spirit of the occasion . Everyone was alert and eager , ready to do his or her bit . Outcries of gratification could be heard as new discoverieswere made . In vain did the drivers of the trucks protest . They were borne down and walked over by the sheer weight of numbers . It was upon this scene of pillage and confusion that thep139originator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension he saw several figures , each provided with one of his chickens , dart through the small door leading to the engine room . It was enough to drive the past from his memory . The present was allimportant . With a wild cry he sprang to his feet and staggered to the defense of his truck which , by the time he reached it , contained little to defend . Bishop Waller with a sigh of relief sank back on the seat and received the congratulations of the party . Loudest among these were those of Little Arthur , now partially recoveredfrom his cataclysmic contact with the deck . " I do n't know what has come over me , " the good Bishop observed rather sadly . " It must be this fog . First I lend my voice to an already sufficiently undignified and acrimonious dispute with an unseen ship , then calmly enter this cabin and assault one of our fellow creatures after having devoured his property . I have forsaken God , I fear . " " But what that monster was doing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced consolingly . " You arrived in the nick of time . I was nearly jarred out , I was . " " Granted , " responded the Bishop , " I had some slight provocation , but Little Arthur , for all of that , it would gall inc immeasurably to lose my chance of salvation through saving your wicked life , as invaluable as it may be to you . " Not knowing which end of this observation to accept , Little Arthur maintained a discreet silence . In the meantime the situation was developing in the engine room . The man with the black face was telephoning passionatelyto the captain . " Yes , sir , " he was telling him . " They 're stealing all my fire , every blessed damn coal . " " What do they want with your fire ? " the captain wanted to know . " It ai n't as cold as all that . "  | " They 're trying to cook some chickens , " the black face roared . " Where did they find the chickens ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that ? " screamed the engineer . " And does it really matter ? Maybe they flew aboard . " " Did you say chickens ? " asked the skipper . " Sure they 're not seagulls ? " " Think I do n't know the difference between a seagull and a chicken ? " the other end of the wire inquired none too pleasantly . " Not saying you do n't , " said the captain . " But a seagull and a chicken might look a lot alike when they 're skinned or unfrocked or whatever they are when all their feathers are off . " " They look altogether different , " said the engineer with cold dignity . " And the word is plucked ' in case you want to use it sometime . " " How do they intend to cook these chickens ? " asked the captain , a note of real interest creeping into his voice . " Fricassee , " howled the engineer , his black face becoming swollen with anger . " Not a bad way , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , Charlie , "  --  and here his voice took on a persuasive note  --  " you see , Charlie , I 've been thinking . We 've been a long time without food . The way things stand I do n't know where the hell we are and where the hell we 're going , and as long as that fire ai n't doing us any good we might as well be using it for something . What do you say , Charlie ? " For a few moments Charlie was unfit to say anything . " I say , " he managed to get out at last , " that my engine room ai n't no damned galley for a flock of commuters with their goddam chickens . That 's what I say . " pI4I " But listen , Charlie , " said the skipper , trying to reason with the man , " fricasseed chicken 's mighty nice eating when it 's properly done . " " Should we be worrying about fricasseed chicken , " demandedCharlie , " when it looks like the fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well gnaw on the chickens ' bones first , " came the philosophic voice of the skipper . " Gnaw and let gnaw , say I. How about it , Charlie ? " For reply the telephone broke into an incoherent babble . The skipper hung up the receiver , called a weary-looking deckhand , and went below to deal in person with the situation . It was a strange scene indeed that greeted the skipper 's gaze . Had it been not quite so small , the engine room or stokehold of the ship would have called to mind a prairie dotted by the fires of early American settlers engaged in cooking their rude evening meal . Perhaps it was because the place was entirely treeless that the captain gained this impression . One glance was sufficient to convince him it would he difficult to find a more unusual situation on any ferryboat anywhere . Commuters , squatting in all positions , were holdingchickens or various parts of chickens above piles of glowingcoals . So frequently were such figures encountered that tile captain found it difficult to walk without stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an appetizingaroma of sizzling fowl . It was enough to make his eyes as well as his mouth water . In a corner of the compartmentthe engineer was standing with a newspaper raised between himself and his uninvited guests . After his conversation with his superior officer he had apparently lost all interest in what was going on in his engine room . " Hello , Charlie , " said the skipper smoothly . " Catching up with the news , I see . " pI42 " Why not ? " replied Charlie over the rim of his paper . " You seem to care more about chicken than running this here ship . I 'm interested in racing , myself . Picking tomorrow'swinners . " " Well , " observed the skipper , " from the way it looks now you 'll have to cable in your selection from mid-Atlantic . I do n't even smell land about , but I do smell chicken . " He smiled engagingly down upon his passengers . " You 've taken things into your own hands , I see , " he continued in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what we 'll do . If you provide us with a brace of chickens , we 'll let you continue cooking yours . " Several chickens were immediately produced and offered for the inspection of the skipper . Selecting two promising specimens of looted fowl , he turned to the newspaper . " Charlie , " he began , " what do you know about cooking chickens ? Here are two beautiful birds . " " Everything , " replied Charlie surprisingly . " Slip me those chickens and I 'll show these home-loving train-snatchers how to cook . I do n't care what happens to this engine room any more . " He rigged up his odd-looking oven and put the chickens through their paces . As he watched the expressions of envy on the faces of the pioneers gathered round him , his annoyancedied away and he felt himself a little consoled . " Ca n't you cram just one more in that contraption ? " a voice asked wistfully . " My fingers are better done than my chicken . " Good-naturedly the black-faced man complied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stokehold on his way to the pilot house he was gnawing on a chicken leg and carrying various carefully selected parts in his other hand . The driver of the assaulted truck followed the happy man 's progress with gloomy , misanthropic eyes. pI43 " Gord , " he muttered , " what a trip this turned out to be . Even the captain himself is no better than a thief . " Quiet water and moonlight and a world lost in fog . I lardly anyone awake now . A few shadows by the rail . Sleep had overcome the commuters , their stomachs no longer empty . Back in the cabin they , the commuters , were draped and crumpled about in fantastic shapes as if a spell had been laid upon the ferry , it 's passengers turned to inanimate objects , inanimate save for the noises they made in their sleep . These are never attractive . Moonbeams strained through fog  --  an eerie effect . It was like living inside a huge halo , its edges washed by black infinity . The ferry glided smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white circle . It was as if New York had been packed in cotton and magically removed . There was no New York , no Jersey shore , no open bay dashed by the prows of ships . Only fog horns sounded remotelyin the darkness , and the occasional warning clang of a bell . " Sounds like a cow out there in the fog , " said Peter to the girl leaning on the rail beside him . " A lonely cow with a bell on grazing among the waves . " " The old girl will get all foggy inside , " said Josephine poetically . " Maybe we 're scaling a Swiss Alp and are coming to a pasture . " " Would n't mind that in the least , " said Peter . " But would n't I be a drawback ? " she asked . " A sort of depraved lady fly reclining brazenly in the ointment ? " Peter looked down into the face upturned to his . Full lips a little moist , and shadows round the eyes . Somehow she contrived to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch felt.  | " You 're more like a wicked spider , " he told her thoughtfully . " A dangerously attractive spideress . " He heard her laugh softly and did not dislike the sound . " I cling to the words attractive , ' wicked , ' and dangerous , ' " she said . " They are more than I usually get from you . How about going inside and lying down ? " " A dangerous spideress would make a suggestion like that , " he observed . " I mean on opposite sides of the ship , " she assured him . " Under the circumstances your interpretation would be mad-ness . " " Then I say , no go , " he said . " My head feels too giddy to park itself anywhere at present , and this damn arm keeps on throbbing . I like it out here with you . " " Mean that ? " " Yes , strange as that may seem . " " I do n't think it 's so strange . After all , I 'm sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being nice , Jo . You 're not at all that way . You 're really a very bad girl . " " That 's how I mean , " she agreed . " I 'm nice and bad . " " Just plain bad , " he said . " Why did you tell Aunt Sophie and Sanders and all those people that you were going to have a baby by me ? " " Well , are n't I , sometime , maybe ? " she asked . " I thought I could read the writing on the wall . " " To begin with you 're not , " said Peter , " and in the second place if you were going to have one of my babies there 'd be no writing on the wall about it . " " All right , mister , " she answered with a little shrug . " Perhaps the wish was father to the thought . " " Your prospective babies are none of my business . " " You 're a hard man , Peter Van Dyck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ca n't you find a little moral weakness somewhere about you ? "  |p145Silence  . Jo moved her tireless young body closer to the man 's good arm . She liked being there . He was such a clean man . Daring little dreams came to her across the water half-formed hopes swaddled in fog . But deep in her heart Josephine did not have any too much hope . Her confidence was all on the surface . " Peter . " " Well ? " " You 're letting me stay mighty close to you . " " Why bring the matter to my attention ? " " Do you like us this way , Peter , all scrunched up ? " " The way you phrase it hardly presents an idyllic picture  --   --  my eyes . Scrunched up  --  no . Make it better . " " I suppose you 're such an old stick you just ca n't help being a stickler . Scrunched up is a fine way . It 's so cozy . " " Sounds almost immoral . " " Your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't be a bit surprised , young lady . " " I 'm glad you told me , Peter . I like your mind that way . " " You deliberately make it that way . I think I 'll call you a trull . " " Oh , what a word to call me ! I rather like it , too . I 'd have done well in the days of Falstaff . " " You 'd have run the fat knight ragged . " " Sir John was ragged most of the time  --  spiritually as well as sartorially . " " You and Sir John have much in common , " said Peter , considering her thoughtfully . " Do you read books ever ? " " Mostly pornography , " she told him . " I read until I come  --  the nasty parts , then I stop to think of you . " " Please spare me your thoughts . " Silence again . The slow indolent churning of propellers and crinkling splash of waves gossiping sleepily under the " Peter . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it funny about being in love and all ? " " I do n't know . What are you trying to drag me into ? " " I mean about being in love , " the girl went on in a small reflective voice . " When you are in love , I mean . It 's so swell if everything 's okay . Not quite so lonely any more , and everything takes on a fresh meaning  --  becomes much more interesting . Even dull things . Happy days waiting just round the corner . And all the time you 're kind of quiet and still inside . It 's like waiting for the curtain to go up or just after it 's gone down . And you have private thoughts about God , and wonder if you 're all right with Him and if He 's going to see you through . Whenever you pass a furniture store you stop to look at the beds . I like a nice bed , Peter . Do n't you ? " " I feared you would end up on some lewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her words . " What have we in common with a bed ? " " I do n't mean right now , Peter . Not this very minute . But some day we might own a bed between us , do n't you think ? " " How should I know ? We might own a flock of beds . " " Oh , you mean the babies . About how many babies would you like ? " Peter grinned at the fog . " Oh , anywhere between five and ten , " he told her . " I might manage five , " she said , " but ten  --  oh , why bother about that now ? We 'll see how ' we stack up after the first five . " " Sure , " replied Peter . " We 'll take stock of ourselves then , but in the meantime , has it occurred to you that we 're not even married yet ? " " It has , " Jo said regretfully . " And what about Yolanda ? " " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Is it all fixed about our loving each other ? " " You seem to have arranged it quite nicely , " said Peter. pI4.7He was more in earnest than he cared to admit even to himself . " Go on , then , " she urged in a low voice . " Say it just once . You can lie a little if you have to . " " You mean tell you in cold blood  --  in so many words that I love you ? " " I do n't care how many words you use , but I would like you to do a little something about your blood . Ca n't you warm it up a bit ? I 've been like that about you for a long t i the . " " How do you mean like that about me ? " he asked . " Go on and say it yourself . " " I love you , Peter , " she said in a small voice . Jo was no longer a bold girl . Rather crushed and subdued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a lot about love , talked a lot about love , and practised it a little , but never before had she told a real live man she loved him and meant it as he did now . And Peter , looking down at her , whether it was because he was becoming a trifle delirious or just beginning to realize what previously he had vaguely suspected , decidedit would not be at all difficult to tell Jo he loved her , provided he said it very quickly and slurred a little on the edges . " IloveyouJo , " he said at full speed ahead . " Damned if I don't. " j " God , how quick ! " gasped Jo . " Where did it get to ? Never mind . It sounded swell while it lasted . And now ? " She held her face up to his . Peter complied . He was at it quite a while . Long enough to let the freshly risen Yolanda witness more than enough . " Peter ! " she cried . " Are you mad ? " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips from Jo 's slightly parted ones.  |p148Six  Characters Embark in More FogFOR A BRIEF MOMENT PETER STOOD CONFRONTING YOLANDA , his face shocked expressionless ; then , remembering her question , he actually feigned madness . Waving his hands about as if leading a multitude in song he burst out in a high , quaveringvoice with :   " My country ' t is of thee , Sweet land of liberty  --  God help the king . " " Stop that awful noise , " Yolanda commanded imperiously . " It 's bad enough to be caught doing what you were doing without singing about it . " " He 's a little light in his head , " Jo said in a quiet voice . " And he 's not singing about it . " " He 's crazy in the head if he thinks he 's fooling me , " ripped out Yolanda . " He acts more like a drunken man than a delirious one . " To force conviction home on Yolanda , the quavering voice redoubled its efforts , this time running short of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty crooks  --  Who 's got the king ?

" " Do you think he 's really gone ? " Yolanda asked doubtfully . " Must be , " Jo replied . " He mistook me for you . Did n't you notice how he was acting ? " " I hope you do n't imagine I let him carry on like that ? " " I sincerely hope not , " said Jo . " But just the same , it was pretty nice . Had n't you better get him inside ? He mightsuddenly take it into his head to go in swimming . " " Heavens ! " exclaimed Yolanda . " He appears to think he'sa seagull now . " Josephine considered the man seriously .   " Either that or a dog , " she said at last . " Come here , Fido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seagull and a dog , " Yolanda remarked in a superior voice . " Not much , " replied Jo , " but a little  --  just enough to make it interesting . Couchez-la , Fido . " " Avec vous , " snapped Peter . " I know French . Ha , ha ! Thistledown ! " Yolanda took the fluttering man by the arm and led him babbling cheerfully into the cabin . Jo turned back to the fog . There was a happy mist in her eyes . If that kiss had lasted thirty more seconds she would have been sure of the man for life . As it was , she felt reasonably safe . She had even room enough in her heart to feel pleasurably sorry for Yolanda . Dawn , instead of dispersing the fog , drew it closer together . From the air above her the voice of the fog horn sounded wearily . Josephine did not mind . The fog could solidify for all she cared . She felt herself authentically in love , and she was ready and willing to fight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the soggy day . Morning became evening and evening became night and the commuters became bored . Beer seemed so far away to Aspirin Liz that she found it almost impossible to think of it in the abstract . Whatever good works the Bishop had set out to perform in New Jersey  --  a state which can stand a lot  --  remained unaccomplished . Drawers no longer played an important part in Little Arthur 's life . Even Yolanda had forgotten about the house party . She was in the presence of grim reality . Having slept in public , an object of desirous scrutiny from God knows how many pairs of vulgar eyes , the fastidious young woman felt herself slightly deflowered . As for Peter Van Dyck he was far from well . Unlike the others he had been unable to get any real sleep . His arm was swollenpI 5 Iend feverish . The Bishop feared infection , but kept his fears to himself . Alone of the little party Josephine seemed unperturbed . Yolanda gained the impression that her fiance 's secretary was actually deriving no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far wrong . Jo had decided that so long as she could be near Peter it did not make much difference what the ferry did on the surface of the sea . Her only anxiety was that the boat might take it into its head to do things beneath . The way the situation stood between herself and Peter gave her a strong desire to live . So she contented herself with bathing the man 's arm and enjoying the assaulted truckman 's attempts haughtily to disregard her hateful presence . She even grinned at him . Commuters were spread out all over the place . The decks were littered with bodies in action or repose . Several packs of cards had mysteriously appeared , and little groups of gentlemenwere playing pinochle as happily and as stolidly as if they had been seated opposite one another on the 5:15 or the S:32 . Fresh water was running low , and faces were growing dingy . Yet it may be surprising to learn that many of the passengers on that long lost ferry were not so distressed as it might seem . Men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements to keep , too familiar faces to look at and voices to hear , stockings to wash , furnaces to stoke , dogs to walk , and even letters to write found in the fogbound ferry a good excuse ready to hand . In one quarter of the cabin a harmonica had broken out In spasm of lippy rhythm to which several stenographers danced from time to time . Jo finally succeeded in dancing with the assaulted truckman , a development which surprised the man as much as it pleased Bishop Waller , who enjoyed seeing people happy and on amicable terms . The few encounters they had with passing but unseen ships led only to further unpleasantness and deepened thepI52captain 's misanthropic attitude towards life in general and seafaring men in particular . " What sort of ship are you ? " he was once so ill advised as to inquire of a wandering vessel . " Oh , I 'm just the loveliest sort of ship , " came back the derisive reply , and the captain almost swooned from humiliationin the privacy of his pilot house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog as soon as he had collected his scattered faculties . " Ca n't even find that , " the fog retorted in tones of deep dejection . " Have you no idea where you are ? " asked the skipper , alittle mollified by the other 's obvious discouragement . " Yes , " came the ready reply . " I have no idea where I arc . How about yourself ? " " I have no idea , too , " yelled the ferry captain . A moment of brooding silence . " Well , " came the voice from the unseen ship , " this conversationdoes n't seem to be helping either one of us . You have no idea and I have no idea . That makes two no ideas . Wonder who 's cornered them all ? " " God knows , " retorted the skipper . " I guess He 'd have a high old time putting his finger on me at this moment , " observed the other . " It 's a hell of a helpless feeling for a great big ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm only a little ferry . " Silence , then muffled laughter . " You 're only a little what ? " asked the fog . " I 'm only a little ferry , " declared the skipper in a voice soft with self-pity . " Fancy that ! " came back the other voice in most insipid tones . " I thought you sounded queer all alone out there in the fog . You poor dear ! Just a little ferry  --  a pansy , as it were . "  |p153The  next minute a deckhand had caught the maddened skipper just as he was on the point of hurling himself from the rail of his ship . The man was blue in the face , and the fringes of the fog round him were curling up beneath the violence of his obscenities . " Tell ' em you 're an ocean liner next time , " the deckhandsaid soothingly to his captain . " Do n't let on you 're a ferry . " The captain turned on him a face in which remained onlythe remotest suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pilot house . " And so are you , " he mouthed as he slammed the door behind him . Wondering so was he what , the deckhand sat down on a packing box and breathed heavily into the fog . Josephine in the wet darkness was leaning over the rail f the slowly drifting ferry . Her ears and eyes were strainedthe point of exhaustion in their efforts to tear from the og the secrets that lay behind . Her eyes failed utterly , but her cars gave food for hope . From somewhere far away in that mysterious chaos of night and fog sounding vaguely like rustling leaves in a fast receding dream , came the faint , ghythmical cadence of water washing against rocks . Fromhat great distance the sound came , the girl was unable tointimate , but that it came from land she was convinced . To Jo at that moment land was all-important . Peter was getting no better . If anything he was worse . She disliked the feverish litter in his eyes and the tight discolored skin round theound . Exhausted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . The realization of Peter 's condition had forced Josephineto revise her opinion of the ferryboat . It was no place or a wounded man . She wanted him safe on dry land , andsome desperate way , unknown at the time to herself , shetended to get him there . For a few seconds longer she lis-pI54tened . That distant murmur still crept to her through the fog . Rapidly she made her way to the pilot house . " Captain , " she began without preamble , " there 's land somewhere about . " " Yes ? " grunted the brooding man . " About what  --  the North Pole ? " " Maybe , " said Jo . " But there 's land nearer than that . Listen . " The captain thrust his head out of his door and listened . Several times he nodded , then closed the door and returned to his brooding . " Well , " asked Jo . " What are you going to do about it ? " " Nothing , " replied the skipper . " It ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Harm ! " cried Jo . " What do you mean , harm ? Are n't you going to land this ferry ? " " You mean run my ship aground on an unknown shore  --  maybe a reef or a mud flat ? Do n't be silly , lady . " " But if you do n't land somewhere , " Jo protested , " We may end up in Cape Town . " " What 's wrong with Cape Town ? " inquired the captain . " Who said anything was wrong with Cape Town ? " " You do n't appear to want to go to Cape Town . " " Would you want to go to Cape Town ? " Jo flung back . " If what ? " asked the captain . " If what ? " she demanded . " How do you mean , if what ? ' " I do n't understand the question , " the captain replied hopelessly . " I did n't understand yours , " she told him . " Then let 's begin again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to Cape Town , and it seemed to me you had n't finished what you wanted to ask and that you meant to say , would you like to go to Cape Town if something or other happened , or words to that effect . Anyway , I 'm tired of Cape Town now and I do n't want to go there any more . "  | " Neither do I , " Jo agreed . " But that place we hear might be Atlantic City for all you know . " " Well , I certainly do n't want to go to Atlantic City , " replied the skipper in exasperation . " Of all places to land up in ! " " Will you tell me , in God 's name , what 's wrong with A t ! antic City ? " she asked in a tired voice . " Will you tell me what is n't wrong with Atlantic City ? " be retorted . " I do n't know , " she said . " It 's nice we agree about something , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo felt inclined to ask him how he would like to go to hell , but instead she tried to find out where he did want , go . " I want to get back to my slip , " the captain told her . ' m not an excursion boat , lady . I 'm a --  " He stoppedsuddenly , remembering his recent encounter with that torentingvoice in the fog . Jo felt stumped and discouraged . It was not that she and skipper spoke two entirely different languages . They spoke so much alike . That was the trouble . Probably the fog had iven both of their minds off on a spur line . Glancing rough one of the pilot-house windows , her eyes encountered small boat lashed to the deck . And whether or not her mind was off the main line , it still continued to function . " If you do n't want to go to Cape Town or Atlantic City , " said in a stipulating voice , " or any other nice , reasonable ide resort , will you let me borrow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this pilot house , lady , " the captain replied with sincere dislike . " I 'll get her into the ter for you and bid you good-bye with the best of feelings . soon as the fog gets you out of my sight I 'll try to get you t of my mind . " pI56 " You do n't have to go as far as that , " said Jo . " What 's to become of the rest of the passengers ? " " You can take every damn one of ' em with you if you want , " he assured her . " If not , they can stay here until somebody comes and drags me home . " " I suppose you expect the grand fleet to escort your damn scow to its slip ? " said the girl annoyingly . But the captain was past being annoyed . ' " I do n't care if it 's the grand duke , " he replied . " I ain'tgoing to endanger my ship for a handful of commuters . " A few minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row , shrimp ? " she asked him . " No , " replied Little Arthur . " I never learned how . " " Only how to pick pockets , eh ? " " I 'm trying to forget that , " he said . " I used to row , " put in Bishop Waller . " Very fond of the exercise at one time . " " You never will be again , " said Jo . " Not after tonight . " She turned back to Little Arthur . " Little man , " she continued , " if a man of God and honest ways is willing to row , you can at least try . And that 's just what you 're going td do if you want to come along with us . You 're going to row us to land if you have to get out and push . " " I can bear a hand with one arm , " said Peter . " It 's a silly-sounding sentence , " she told him , " but I guess your heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowed me round Central Park , " Aspirin Liz contributed reminiscently . " Yeah , and after that treat what did he do  --  collapse ? " Little Arthur inquired . " Are you looking for trouble ? " the lady asked with terrifyingquietness . " No , " said Little Arthur quickly . " We 've got trouble . I was just thinking " pI57 " Do n't , " Aspirin Liz admonished him . " That is , do n't ink about me . " Up to the moment of departure Yolanda Wilmont protcdagainst this new and dangerous venture . She couldno good resulting from going rowing at night in a fog . owever , as the others gave every indication of abandoning c ship as well as herself and the luggage unless she altered r attitude , Yolanda reluctantly tagged along with the rangely assorted party . " If you had n't insisted on bringing that dangerous criminalalong , " she told Peter , " you never would have been shot . Obviously the murderer was aiming at him . " " Ca n't say as I blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the side of the ferry to the small boat  --  low her . " I blame him for missing , " put in Jo , following the exmodel down into what impressed her as being illimitable space turned uncompromisingly black . " Ai n't you all ever going ter stop nagging at me ? " asked 1ittle Arthur . " Everybody should be friendly and all at a dreadful time like this . " It required the close cooperation of both the Bishop and Peter , wounded as he was , to lower the small crook into the bobbing boat . Passengers shouted advice while from the upper deck the captain peered down at them sardonically . " For a worthless thing , Little Arthur , " grunted Peter , " you place too high a value on that damned life of yours . Pardon the word , Bishop . " " Perhaps it would make us all feel better if we called a temporary armistice on the niceties of speech , " observed the Bishop as his foot searched thoughtfully for something or anything in the darkness below him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms employed by only the most recondite students of obscene language . " " So long , chief , " called Jo from the boat to the black- faced man who was looking gloomily over the side . " Next time I steal a chicken I 'll let you cook it for me . " " Hope I never see a chicken again , " said the chief . " Good luck , lady . " " Hope you never see one of mine , " put in the truckman . " Here , little miss , " he called down to Jo , and stooping , passed her several packages . " You forgot to take these when you and the rest of this ship 's company were robbing my truck . Thanks for the dance . " " Thank you , " replied Jo . " How did you know I liked cheese and crackers ? " " I sort of hoped you did n't , " said the man , grinning down at her . " Shove off , " Peter sang out to the Bishop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please stop milling about so blithely . The boat might lose its patience . " As the little boat shoved off into the fog and darkness , a cheer broke from the passengers lining the rails of the ferry . Individual voices quickly became indistinct and merged with the general babble . Suddenly a parting impulse of malice warmed Little Arthur 's chilled breast . " What did you say you were , Captain ? " he called in a high-pitched voice . " Only a little what ? " Immediately the fog was made hideously vocal by the voice of the now invisible skipper . Jeers and catcalls broke from the passengers . They seemed to be directed against their own ship 's officer . The Bishop increased his stroke . " If you 're trying to row us out of the way of all that bad language , " said Josephine , " you might just as well save your strength , Bishop . We do n't mind it in the least . " " It 's odd , but neither do I , " Bishop Waller got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vicarious kick  --  I think that is the word . " " Listen , " Jo commanded . " It would never do to lose thatp159offshore sound or whatever it is . " For a moment the voluntary castaways held their breath in anxious silence . " All right , " said Jo at last . " It 's coming from dead ahead . " " Ca n't you say straight ahead ? " asked Little Arthur . " We 're too close ter being the other . "  |p160From  the Nowhere Into the Unknown " THINGS ARE NOT SO DESPERATE , " SAID JO , BREAKING Aheavy silence made a little less awe-inspiring by the heaving of the indomitable Bishop . " Here we all are , the six of us.  |p161Three  men and three women  --  just as it should be . There 's Peter and myself , Yolanda and Little Arthur , and " Just call me Liz , " supplied the retired model . " Everybody does . Aspirin Liz  --  the former being one of my vices . " " A name in a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , then , there 's Aspirin Liz and the Bishop . All cozy in a little boat . " " With more than enough water under our feet , " put in little Arthur miserably , " to swaller us all in the blink of an eye . " " Are you by any chance bracketing my name with that unwashed mite of a criminal ? " Yolanda demanded arrogantly . " I knew he was a criminal , " replied Jo , " but I did n't know he was an unwashed one . How did you find that out ? " " I am accustomed to clean men , " Yolanda asserted coldly . " Clean men with fresh linen . " " Have you gone as far as that with Little Arthur already ? " inquired Jo . " You must have worked fast and deftly . " " One needs only to look at the man to get an unpleasant conception of what lies beneath , " vouchsafed Yolanda . " Is that any way to talk ? " Little Arthur was on the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 'd like to know it , I am washed , and if I had n't been looking for a  --  a " " For clean linen , " said Jo helpfully . " Yes , " said Little Arthur . " If I had n't been looking for a fresh pair of those I 'd of been taking the old ones off right now in the privacy of my own kip . " " Do you ? " inquired Jo . " Do I what ? " asked the pickpocket . " Take ' em off ? " the girl replied . " Of course I do , " the small man lyingly stated . " I did n't know , " Jo told him . " Some men do n't . You impressed me as being such a type . " " Do n't see why you should be discussing my habits at all right out loud in this fog and weather , " Little Arthur complained . " Ai n't we got no private lives ? "  | " Thus far , " observed the red-headed girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have decided to take steps . " " We wo n't have any lives at all , " Peter put in , " if you two charming young things do n't abandon Little Arthur 's drawers as well as what 's in them , and listen like hell for the shore . " " Well meant but indelicately expressed , " replied Jo . " In moments of great danger the mind has a way of fixing itself on trifles . Should we sing , perhaps ? People always do in little boats . " " Not a bad idea , that , " Bishop Waller pronounced . " Singinglightens the spirits . Why not try a snatch of a song while I row ? " " I know a song , " said Aspirin Liz . " Let 's have it , " suggested Peter . " Anyone got a pill ? " she asked . " Might have one in my bag , " said Jo . " I 'll look . " The girl succeeded in finding a rather soiled aspirin tablet and passed it to Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Little Arthur asked . " Never use water , " she said . " Keep it under my tongue . It 's better that way . " Little Arthur shook his head in the darkness . This woman was hard indeed . When the tablet had been satisfactorily adjusted under Aspirin Liz 's tongue , she broke suddenly into violent song , her voice floating mournfully across the water : " O bury me not on the lone prairie-e-e Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me , But lay me out in a quiet churchyard In a grave dug six by three . " So sang Aspirin Liz as a depressed silence fell upon the occupants of the little boat . Their spirits were not lightened.  | " Golly , " said Little Arthur with a slight shiver . " That 's an awfully sad song . Them howling coyotes . I can hear ' em now . " " Wish I could , " replied Jo . " I 'd let a chorus of wild coyoteshowl o'er me if they 'd give me a prairie to park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and darkness . " " Wonder what it is , " said Yolanda in a subdued voice . " Africa , maybe , " Jo answered . " Wish it were the Riviera , " observed Peter . " Ai n't we got enough water already without adding someforeign river to it ? " the ignorant little felon demanded . No one paid any attention to him , each being occupied with his or her thoughts . " It 's a miscellaneous cargo we have aboard , " observed Aspirin Liz at last . " A bishop and a crook and a lady of fashion  --  what are you , Mr. Van Dyck ? I 'm a model , myself  --  thatis , I was one before I lost my shape . " " Do n't know what I am exactly , " Peter replied , somewhat in doubt himself . " What am I , Jo ? " " An indifferent coffee importer , " answered Jo . " And I 'm his invaluable secretary . " " He 's the only surviving male of one of New York 's oldest families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on ! Is he , now ? " said Little Arthur . " Well , I 'm proud to be wearing his drawers , but if we do n't find a scrap of dry land soon it looks like that old family is about due to lose its last male survivor . " " Right , Little Arthur , " Jo maliciously agreed . " Instead , they can lay claim to having the soggiest nonsurviving male of any old family anywhere . " " That , at least , " remarked Peter , " would lend me a little distinction . " " I like you better dry , " said Jo , " and very much alive  --  pulsating , in fact . "  | " What do you mean by that ? " asked Peter . " My dear , " Jo replied . " Spare the Bishop 's feelings . " " You 're a wicked lady , " declared Little Arthur . " And you use horrid words  --  pulsating . " " I 'll use horrid words on you , " Jo told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiff will ride higher from the loss of one feather-weight crook . " " Which end of these sticks do you pull ? " gasped Little Arthur after the perilous exchange of seats had been made , not without endangering the safety of all hands . " Just to hold ' em still is hard enough , much less waggling ' em about . " " Do n't make yourself out any dumber than you are , " repliedJo . " Put the wet ends of those sticks in the water and pull your small but black heart out . " " Sure , sonny , " said Aspirin Liz encouragingly . " Find a pocket in the fog and pick your way through it . " " I ca n't stand wisecracking women , " Little Arthur remarked to misty chaos . " Bad taste and worse manners . " Slowly the rowboat moved ahead , but very slowly  --  too slowly . Peter critically watched his valet . " Little man , " he said , " you 're not pulling those oars . They 're pulling you . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what ? " groaned Little Arthur . " Wish I could put them into a bed . " " Use your back , man , " the Bishop commanded somewhat impatiently . Little Arthur laughed hysterically . " Use my back , " he sneered . " Ca n't even use the mere end of my back . Every time I try to put it down on the scat these here oars deliberately flip it off as if it was a moth . First thing you know I 'll be flying . And you ask me to use my back . " " If you do n't use your back I 'll kick it , " said Jo . " Want me to sit on your lap ? " asked Aspirin Liz . " That would hold it down . "  | " That would break it down , " he told her . " Let me alone for a minute . I 'll get the hang of it soon . What do you expect a pickpocket to be  --  a motorboat all of a sudden ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a move on , " Josephine declared . " Have a heart , lady , " he pleaded . " This was your idea , having me row . I did n't ask for the job . " " I think he talks too much , " said Peter . " Let 's gag the little blighter . " " I 'm gagging already , " the little blighter complained . " No need to help me . Fair sick I am , what with all this brutality and bobbing about . " " Pipe down , everybody , " Jo commanded . " I hear some-thing . " Something was wallowing close by in the fog . " Who 's there ? " called Peter . " Only us , " replied a familiar voice ironically . " You mean the ferry ? " Peter almost screamed . " Yoohoo ! " called the voice . " That 's who we are . " " For God 's sake go away , " yelled Peter . " What for ? " said the voice . " We like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " shouted four voices from the rowboat , Little Arthur being too discouraged to answer and Yolanda too disgusted . All sorts of unpleasant noises were launched from the ferry . Personal insults fell thick around them . Even Little Arthur was stung to life and action . " How 's our dear sweet captain ? " he inquired , with an astoundingvocal inflection . Immediately the captain told them not only how he was , but also how he hoped they were and where he hoped they would go . He referred individually and collectively to the characters , antecedents , and habits of everyone in the rowboat , and finished up by threatening to run the small craft down . It was too much for Little Arthur . He stood up sud- denly , and like Ajax defying the lightning , impotently thumbed his nose at the fog in the direction of the ferry . There was a loud cry and a small splash . Little Arthur was no more with them . It required some minutes to drag the wet snatch-purse back over the side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling was equal to his fear of cold water . He was a small , soggy mass of moist lamentation , the utter futility of ever changing one 's undergarments being his chief source of complaint . At last he lay panting in a puddle in the bottom of the boat . " Bruised , body and soul , " he muttered . " A nervous break-. down , no less . A mangled man . " " If you ever try to give us the slip again , " Jo gritted at him between her small white teeth , " you 'll be a mutilated man . " " What ! " he choked . " Do you think I tried to do it ? " " Of course you tried to do it . Wanted to run away , " said Jo . " Across the bottom of the sea , I suppose ? " he - retorted . " I ai n't no blarsted mermaid . " " Well , if you 're not a mermaid , " she continued , " I 'd like to know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Might not be human , " the man admitted , beginning to doubt it himself . " Do n't feel like it right now . But I ai n't no mermaid , at any rate , and I ai n't no trained seal , either , like you think I am , making me do boat-racing all over the fog . " " Little valet , " put in Peter with calm conviction , " if you do n't get up quietly and quickly and stop all that yapping , I 'm going to put you beyond the reach of the law forever , and that with this one hand . " Little Arthur took a look at the one clawlike hand extended over him and thanked his God it was not two.  | " Yes , sir , " he muttered . " Can I sit down by you ? " " I 'm going to row , " said Peter . " Rested up , Bishop ? I 'll take the starboard oar . " When this arrangement had been worked out , the rowboat once more got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferryboat 's passengers followed them through the fog , then gradually died away . Silence settled down on the occupants of the rowboat . Peter and the Bishop were too deeply occupied to speak . Little Arthur was too miserable , Yolanda too aloof . Josephine listened for offshoresounds , and Aspirin Liz seemed content to sit and do nothing . The minutes piled up and drifted by until time became as nebulous as the fog . Still the two rowers stuck to their oars . Peter was cracking under the strain . His face had grown a little more haggard , his cheeks flushed . Josephine quietly removed the oar from his hand and seated herself by the Bishop . " Give way , " she said . " I hear waves washing on something more substantial than fog . " Peter sank down by Aspirin Liz and again the boat moved forward , tunneling its way mole-like through the fog . Sounds of a chugging motor came from the port side . " Who are you ? " called the Bishop , resting on his oar . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native land , " came the prompt reply . " You 're frank about it , " Bishop Waller declared . " We can afford to be in this fog , " the voice answered cheerfully . " We 're more than frank  --  we 're abandoned . " " We 're abandoned , too , but without any rum , " Josephine informed the American citizens . " That 's bad , " came the sympathetic reply . " Perhaps you would care for a bottle ? " " We 'd devote our lives to it , " yelled Peter . " Dedicate them to the bottle . "  | " Have you a corkscrew ? " called Jo . " You all ca n't be American citizens , " came back the voice , " if you have n't one of those things . Stand by to break the Eighteenth Amendment , and keep on shouting . " The chugging of the motor grew nearer , and presently a hand holding a quart bottle , and reminding Peter of a picture of Excalibur in some long-forgotten book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the hand cryptically . " Remove the cork and drink . " " Awfully good of you , " said Peter , plucking the bottle from the fog . " Do n't mention it , " replied the voice , equally courteous . At this moment a stealthy breath of wind blew the fog aside . The moon swam through the mist . The night became vivid . " Why , you 're all naked , " said Peter , too stunned to be surprised . " Yes , quite , " said the man in the motorboat . " We all are . " A synchronous gasp broke from the rowboat . " God send back the fog , " prayed the Bishop , in a fervid voice ; then added , with a note of prudence : " Temporarily , at least . " Although there were only five naked figures in the motorboat , they were quite enough for those in the smaller craft . To them the motorboat was fairly swarming with naked figures . It was by no means difficult to distinguish between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing yet neverthelesstrue that there seems to be a lot more to five naked persons than to five persons either fully or partially clad . There was certainly more than enough to those five naked bodies . " Gord , " breathed Little Arthur . " How come you lost all yer clothes ? "  | " We did n't lose them , " the naked spokesman replied . " We took them off . " " Whatever for ? " the crook asked incredulously . " Do n't ask such silly questions of the gentleman , " Josephineprimly told the pickpocket . " I see no good reason for asking him any questions at all , silly or otherwise , " put in Yolanda , her eyes averted but not closed . " Oh , do n't mind us , " said the man easily . " This is our way of doing things , that 's all . " " It 's a poor way , indeed , " said Bishop Waller . " Would n't it be more thoughtful to do such things elsewhere ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " You seem to think we 're considering your plight , " replied the Bishop , " whereas in reality we 're considering only ours . It 's distressing enough to be investigating an unknown body of water without the enforced companionship of five naked ones . " " Oh , you 'll get used to all that , " said the man prophetically . " Do you mean by that , " inquired the Bishop , " that you plan to continue this close association ? " " If that great big strapping woman with the mole on do n't stop grinning at me , " chimed in Little Arthur , " I 'm going to jump clean back in the ocean . " " Where 's the mole ? " demanded Jo . " What a thing to ask , " the valet retorted indignantly . " It 's where nobody should see it , that 's where it is . " " Then why look ? " asked Bishop Waller . " Nonsense , " Aspirin Liz observed with the utmost calm . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like her myself in my day . " " What do yer mean ? " cried Arthur . " Mean ter say you ran about naked ? " " I usually stood or lay , " replied the imperturbable Liz.  | " And you openly admit it in public ? " the small crook got out in a scared voice . " Oh , you are a one , you are . A regular broad and no mistake . " " Fiddlesticks ! " snapped the retired model . " I made my living that way . " " It ai n't a thing to dig up out of the past , " Little Arthur told her , " much less to brag about when we 're all in danger . " The naked man and his companions had been enjoying this conversation . One of the women now spoke . " Why do n't you get naked like us , midget ? " she asked Little Arthur with a touch of malice . " Or are you afraid you 'd fall apart ? " " Mind your own business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of yourself . " " I 've lost all shame , " said the woman . " Madam , " pronounced the Bishop , " if you 'll pardon me , you 've lost a lot more than that , and if you do n't do something about yourself rather soon I 'm afraid I 'll lose the training of years and go a little bit mad . " What the woman could have done about herself will never be learned , because the fog intervened at that moment and devoured her nakedness . " Mr. Van Dyck , " resumed the Bishop when the unique group had faded from view , " I think it would be just as well if someone else tried that bottle other than yourself . " " Pardon me , " said Peter , passing the bottle to the Bishop . " The incident rather unnerved me . " " I 'm hardly tranquil myself , " replied the Bishop . " And then , of course , there 's the fog . That is equally or , rather , almost as dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Jo , his rowing partner . " My child , " he said in a hoarse voice , " this will strengthen your arms . " It must have had that effect , for no sooner had the girlp171polished off her drink and passed the bottle to Aspirin Liz than she and the Bishop began to row with surprising speed and irregularity . The boat darted capriciously through the fog . Once it pivoted crazily round , then started off at its mad pace . Evidently Josephine and the Bishop were intent on seeing which side of the boat would get anywhere first . " How far is the nearest land ? " called Peter after the motor boat . " That depends on which way you 're heading , " came the rather disturbing reply . " Not far in one direction , but thou-. sands of miles in the other . " " Which way are we going ? " " Just about the middle , " the voice drifted back . " A lot of help that is , " grumbled Little Arthur . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Give the little convert a dram or so , " puffed the Bishop . " It will do him a world of good . " " I do n't want to do him any , " said Aspirin Liz . " Here you are , crime wavelet , choke yourself to God while you 're still redeemed . " " No need ter get nasty about it , " objected Little Arthur , accepting the bottle with an eager hand . " If a bishop can keep this stuff down I ought ter be able ter get it down , at least . " With a feeling of fascinated revulsion Yolanda watched the Adam 's apple as it bobbed and quivered , paused , then bobbed again in Little Arthur 's throat . " There seems to be even less sex distinction in this boat than in the other , " she observed bitterly . Little Arthur took the bottle away from his lips and eyed the young lady reprovingly . " Should n't talk about sex , " he rebuked her . " We 've seen too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After watching you , " she informed him , " I find it easy to refuse . "  | " Ai n't nobody civil in this here boat ? " the small man asked hopelessly . " I 'm just sufficiently civil to accept a drink from you , Little Arthur , " Peter told him , reaching for the bottle . " Even though I am trying , " remarked the Bishop , resting a moment on his oar , " still I ca n't quite forget that singular encounter of a few minutes ago . " " Would n't have been more surprised , " remarked Aspirin Liz , " if that boat had been chuck-full of bounding lions . " " No doubt we 'll never learn the beginning or end of that story , " Josephine said . " This whole business has a dreamlike quality . " " I do n't mind it , " replied Peter drowsily . Fatigue , grog , and fever were assaulting him with sleep . Soon he was well off , half drunk and half in dreams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , " put in Little Arthur with an air of one who had always done a little more than his duty to his country . " Look ! What 's that ? " cried Aspirin Liz in a startled voice pointing to a white strip lying pallid beneath the filtered light of a moon swinging high above the fog . " That 's dry land , " Josephine informed her . " Ever hear of it before ? " " It seems to have been connected with my far-distant past , " said Aspirin Liz , her eyes devouring the smooth beach . " That and beer . " A few minutes later the rowboat scratched its nose on the sand , but Peter Van Dyck never knew it . He was unconsciousof what lay behind him as well as of what lay ahead . Had he not been so , he might have put back to sea.  |p173The  Naked PhysicianPETER VAN DYCK AWOKE TO FIND A NAKED FIGURE STANDingby his bed . This hardly placed the figure in Peter 's mind . To him almost any naked figure would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of his thirty-fourp174years Peter had scarcely associated at all with naked figures . From what he saw of this one , he had no desire to take up the practice at this late date . Therefore it was with a feeling of mingled constraint and alarm that he swiftly cast his eyes over this unclad body before resolutely looking at something else . The man was carrying a small black bag . This added to the shock , this bag . Its owner was standing in an attitude of negligent but well-bred repose which struck Peter as being rather incongruous in view of his appalling condition . Could this stranger be , by any remote chance , the telephoneman gone a little mad , Peter wondered , or a skilled artisan subject to one of those embarrassing mental aberrationspopularized by Freud ? Could he possibly have called to do things to a typewriter or a drain pipe or to perform some other highly specialized operation involving the removalof his clothes ? Far simpler it was to assume that the man had been on his way to take a bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another human face . But why the black bag ? Peter decided to ask rather than to wonder . " Hello , " he said . " Who are you ? " The man smiled much more naturally than Peter had believeda naked man with a black bag could smile . " I am the doctor , " he said in a well-dressed , cultured voice . " The doctor of the house . " Peter gagged a little at this . " What , " he began rather fearfully , " what sort of a house is it ? " " A delightful one , my dear sir , " said the doctor . " In what sense ? " asked Peter . " In every sense , " the man assured him . Suddenly Peter remembered . His arm . He must have grown worse during the night . " Listen , Doctor , " he said anxiously , " I must be sick as hell if you did n't stop to put on your clothes . "  | " Nonsense , " replied the doctor shortly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my patients like this . " Peter shrank back among the pillows . " Oh , " he said faintly . " You do ? " " Why not ? " snapped the doctor . " Why not , indeed ? " repeated Peter with a sick smile . " Being a doctor and being used to naked bodies and all , I suppose you do n't mind . . . much . " " Much ! " exclaimed the doctor , laughing scornfully . " Why , tinny dear chap , I do n't mind at all . Like it , in fact . " " And your patients ? " inquired Peter . " They like it , too , " said the doctor complacently . " They do ? " asked the incredulous Peter . " Certainly , " replied the doctor . " Why not ? " " I wish you would stop asking me why not , " Peter complained , once more running his eyes rapidly over the naked man . " From where I am I can see any number of reasons why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded the doctor . " Tell me that . " " Merely that you 're as naked as the palm of my hand , " Peter observed . " Apart from that small item you look perfectlynatural . " " My patients do n't seem to mind , " retorted the doctor . " I ca n't understand that , " said Peter . " I should think they 'd all pass out from sheer panic . " " My dear young man , " said the doctor , striding over to the window with his little black bag , " do n't be childish . " " Come away from that window , " cried Peter . " Do n't make this a public scandal . " " Why worry about that ? " said the doctor carelessly . " Somebody has to worry about it , " replied Peter . " I have no desire to have you seen in my room . It 's not at all nice , Doc . Would n't be quite so degrading if you happened to be a woman , although that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " answered the doctor , flexing his limbs by squatting suddenly . " You 'll have more than you want of those in here . " Peter was too alarmed by the man 's words to be revolted by his actions . " What ! " he exclaimed . " Naked women in here ? " " Why not ? " asked the doctor , turning from the window . " Let 's be reasonable , " said Peter . " You know why notwithout asking me . You 're a bit of a joker , are n't you , Doc ? " " Not at all , " the doctor answered coolly . " Some of myfavorite patients are women , if you 'd like to know . " " You must n't get much work done , " Peter remarkedthoughtfully . " Just what do you mean by that , young man ? " asked the doctor . " Everything , " said Peter . " All . " " You 're vulgar , " replied the doctor severely . " Lots of my patients are ladies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Peter , " but at least they have bedclothes over them . " " I pull those off , " snapped the doctor . " Good God ! " said Peter . " What a doctor ! " " As a matter of fact , " the doctor went on meditatively , " the ladies seem to take to it quicker than the men . " " Take to what ? " asked Peter fearfully . " Being naked , " replied the doctor . " Do you mean to your being naked or to their being naked ? " Peter wanted to know . " To our being naked together , " said the doctor , neatly dislodging with his left foot a spring fly from his right shin . " Well , that seems natural , at least , " went on Peter , " although I rather boggle at the term ladies . ' " " That 's what they are , " said the doctor . " Perfect ladies . " " Perfect in what sense , may I ask ? "  | " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have a rather distorted conception of just what is right , " observed Peter . " For example , I do n't think it 's at all right for you to call naked on equally naked ladies . " " Why not ? " demanded the doctor . " I cure them , do n't I ? " " I know , " went on Peter reasonably , " but curing them of one complaint might easily give rise to another . " " There are never any such complications , I assure you , " said the doctor with great dignity . " Then there must be something funny about the whole business , " muttered Peter , thinking of Josephine 's legs . " Or else you 're a little more than human or ' way below par . I do n't understand it at all . " " No , " replied the doctor . " You 're too much a creature of the flesh . " Peter laughed sarcastically . " You 're entirely a creature of the flesh , " he retorted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment , his troubled gaze straying through the door carelessly left open by this mad or abandoned doctor , Peter witnessed a little incident not given to every man to behold . A naked man , blithely carrying a ladder under one arm and swinging a pail of paint in his free hand , was footing it silently along the hall from one direction . From the other came a woman , equally innocent of clothing . She was bearing a breakfast tray . Peter 's natural assumption was that the woman upon seeing the man would drop her tray and run like hell while the man would do likewise . Instead , he was shocked to see them dexterously pass each other with an agreeable nod and continue calmly about their business . The man in the bed drew a deep breath , then his eyes sought the doctor 's .   " Do all the servants in this place go about like that ? " he asked . " And for God 's sake do n't say Why not ? ' " " I feel like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have them go about ? " Peter momentarily thought of the Bishop , then a small grin relieved the tenseness of his lips . " Could n't you dig up a couple of towels for them ? " he asked . " And what , pray , would they do with the towels ? " " Hang them about themselves somewhere , " said Peter . " Even you should see a little sense in that , Doc . " " ' Fraid I 'm a trifle dense , " remarked the doctor , now busy with Peter 's arm . " Ca n't see it at all . Exactly where you would want them to hang the towels is beyond my comprehension . However " " You are sadly lacking in imagination , " said Peter , a little bitterly . He said no more for the reason that he had suddenly disappearedbeneath the bedclothing . A naked woman , bearing bandages and a basin of warm water , had come briskly into the room . " Here you are , Doctor , " he heard her say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman in Seventeen who refuses to give me his drawers . " " Sit it down , sit it down , " replied the doctor testily , and Peter wondered under the blankets how a naked man was able to talk like that to a naked woman . The doctor was struggling with the coverings . He was trying to pull them off . " No , you do n't , " grunted Peter . " You did n't give me any pajamas . " Have we any pajamas on ? " cried the doctor , panting a little from exertion . " No , " replied Peter . " You have not . You 're both naked as hell and you 're trying to make me like you . " P179He heard the girl laugh horridly , then fresh hands were laid on the coverings . It was an unequal struggle . What with Peter 's wounded arm there were four hands against one . " How far are you going to pull those coverings down ? " he gasped . " All the way , " gritted the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter , wild-eyed , gazed helplessly up at the two bodies bending over his . The girl 's eyes were merry while those of the doctor were mad . " No more of this larking , " the man snapped , skillfully bathing Peter 's arm . " Larking , " said Peter , amazed . " Did you think I was doing that ? " " Either that or making a lot of fuss over nothing . " " Nothing ! " cried Peter in a frenzied voice as he ran hiseyes down over his body . " Oh , God , he calls it nothing . " " Stop trying to attract attention to yourself , " rasped thedoctor . " You 're not so hot . " Peter was almost speechless with indignation . " Call attention to myself ? " he repeated . " I ask you  --  could I be any more conspicuous than I am ? " " Certainly , " replied the girl , her blue eyes dancing with unholy merriment . " In evening clothes you might pique my curiosity . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill . " " Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? " he asked her in a wounded and wondering voice . " Not a bit , " she replied . " It 's all in the day 's work . " " Then God knows what you must do at night , " he answered . " There 's no use for me to try to look somewhere else , because wherever my eyes turn one of your naked bodies manages to get in the way . " " Why not look at yourself ? " suggested the doctor . " That sight is even harder to bear , " said Peter .   " Funny , " remarked the girl . " I do n't seem to mind you at all . " " Why do n't you both crawl in bed with me and make it a clean sweep while you 're at it ? " Peter asked sarcastically . " You do n't seem to mind anything . " " I 'd hate to do that , " said the doctor fastidiously . " Is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong with me ? " " I believe you 're a thoroughly evil-minded man , " replied the doctor . " You 'll have to watch your p 's and q 's round here . " " Strikes me I 'll have to watch a damn sight more than that , " muttered Peter . " Do n't fret , " put in the girl soothingly . " We 'll keep an eye on you . " " That 's just what I 'm worrying about , " said Peter . " There 'll be too many eyes on me . " " You 'll have quite a lot to do with your own eyes , " said the girl . " Do n't forget that . " " Not for a minute , " Peter answered . There was a scuffling sound at the door as Little Arthur , armed with a mop and pail , scrambled nakedly into the room . " Boss ! " he cried wildly , running up to the bed . " They 've taken away all my clothes and I 'm as naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Peter . " A babe , " replied Little Arthur , a strange and awful sight . " A small child . " " You impress me as being much nakeder than even the smallest child , " said Peter . " You 're simply epic . " " Do n't know what that is , but how about yourself ? " asked Little Arthur . " And look at that brazen hussy . " " At least I 've a bandage on , " replied Peter . " And do n't ask me to look at anything . Never thought I 'd see so much in all my life . " THE NAKED PHYSICIAN 181 " What the hell good is a pickpocket in a nudist colony , I ask you ? " the little man tragically demanded . " That is something to ponder on , " observed Peter . " I should imagine you 'd have to be far cleverer with your hands than you 've ever been before . " " Might just as well have no hands at all , " Little Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " added Peter . " However , I should imagine that many men in a nudist colony would find one pair of hands hardly enough . By the way , are we in a nudist colony ? " " Either that or among the white-slavers , " breathed the little crook . " It all comes to the same thing . " " Which is ? " inquired Peter . Little Arthur blushed . " Do n't ask that , " he stammered , " in front of this here woman . " " Oh , " said Peter . " Have you met these nudes already ? " " If not them , I 've met a dozen just as bare , " Little Arthur lamented . " Ca n't keep my eyes in one place long enough to tell one of ' em from the other . Do n't know which way to turn . " " Why not crawl into your pail ? " asked Peter . " Wish I could , " the naked felon replied . " If it was n't full of water I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway , " snapped the doctor , speaking for the first time since Arthur 's arrival , " and hold it there awhile . " " Nice way for a doctor to talk , " said Little Arthur , offended . " It 's a murder house , that 's what it is , and worse . " " I was speaking personally rather than professionally , " the doctor told him . " Speaking professionally , I 'll have to ask you to get about your business , whatever it may be . " " They want me to swab up the bathroom , " the **26;1501;TOOLONG complained with a sob in his voice . " Think of it . Me swabbing up a bathroom the way I am. "  | " I should think the way you are would be ideal for bathroomswabbing , " allowed Peter . " You 're almost as bad as they are , boss , " the little man replied . " Do n't you feel sort of funny lying there naked and all ? " " Sure , " said Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . " " Hurry , " commanded the doctor . " If you do n't want to get into any trouble , do exactly as you 're told . Otherwise , things will go hard with you , let me assure you of that . We stand for no nonsense . " " If you ask me , that 's all it is , " said Little Arthur , moving slowly towards the door . " Too damn much nonsense . Runningaround naked and carrying on . I suppose you think that 's sensible ? Well , it is n't . It 's just plain childish , I calls it . It 's worse than that  --  it 's nasty , that 's what it is . It ai n't even human . " The doctor pointed a sharp instrument at the scolding crook . " Want me to operate on you ? " he asked . Little Arthur instinctively glanced at himself . " Oh , no , " he breathed . " No indeed . " Peter chuckled in spite of his own unprotected state . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere . " Then be gone ! " thundered the doctor . " See here , " protested Peter . " You ca n't talk to my man like that . " The doctor looked darkly at Peter , then suddenly snipped the gleaming blade at him . " How would you like that ? " he asked in a gloating voice . " Or this ? " Here the doctor made an even more excruciating snip at Peter as if visualizing the horrid deed . Peter shrank visibly in every fibre of his body . " There 's no need to be so vivid about it , " he muttered . " Sop183garishly dramatic . I 'd do exactly as he says , Little Arthur , if you want to remain intact . This man is sort of crazy . " " Ca n't I stay here with him ? " pleaded the little man . " Naked as he is , I can at least recognize his voice . " " Go , " said the doctor , and Little Arthur , mop and pail , disappeared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his valet had gone nakedly to whatever lay ahead . " I 've been hesitating over this question for some time . Tell me honestly  --  am I in a madhouse or a socially prominent brothel , or in the shrine of some fanatical cult , or just where am I ? " " I am not in a position to satisfy your puzzling curiosity , " replied the doctor , repacking his little black bag . " Then it certainly must be terrible , " observed Peter , " because you apparently stop at nothing . " " Come , " said the doctor to the girl . " We must be skip-ping . " " Do n't skip before me , " put in Peter . " I do n't think I could bear the sight and still retain my reason . " " Your wound , which luckily is slight , " continued the doctor , ignoring Peter 's remark , " will be dressed again this evening . " " Could n't you leave me a little extra dressing ? " Peter asked . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That would be cheating , " said the girl , following the doctor from the room . " Besides , it would look extremely silly . " " I feel extremely silly , " Peter called after her as she left the room without closing the door . No sooner were his two visitors gone than Peter sprang from the bed and tiptoed to the window . Protected by a curtain he discreetly peered out upon a green , rolling lawn splashed with sunlight and early flowers nodding up encouraginglyat him in a breeze blowing fresh from the sea . And there was the sea itself , the sea looking a little un/familiar now that it was clear of fog . Forever and forever it seemed to run , that flat , streaming surface , into a cool blue solitude untroubled by voice or wing . In his present naked predicament Peter very much wished he could enjoy a reasonable quantity of that solitude himself . Shifting his fascinated eyes from this ever-reaching expanse , he turned them on the dense , deep green of trees sweeping round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind , white clouds above , and white bodies on the lawn , white and gleamingly naked . An appalling sight , this , and yet not unpicturesque . Peter drew a deep breath . A little of his profound belief in the established order of things began to drop away from him . In the face of so much nudity he found himself doubting the reality of such terrifically reiterated facts as the Empire State Building , Tammany Hall , and crooning . Had the bodies been black instead of white , he would have felt a little better about it . Black bodies and brown ones had a way of getting naked . But , then , the black races were not essentially interested in things of the flesh like the white race . No . Black people took the flesh at a stride and passed on to the supernatural and other things of the spirit with only an occasional fleshly picnic  --  a good rough-andtumblesort of orgy that cleared up a lot of nonsense and left their thoughts free for other and more important considerations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive sound in the room behind him . Turning , he beheld still anothernaked body . But this naked body was by all odds more disconcerting than those he had previously encountered , and this in spite of the fact that it was the most alluringly fashioned body it had ever been his good fortune to behold . For a moment there was a tense , watchful silence in the room as wave upon wave of emotion dashed over Peter , but before he went down for the third time a bright little idea came to what he hoped would be his salvation . With nerve/less limbs he staggered to the bed and disappeared beneath its coverings . However , the same bright idea seemed to have found an opening in Josephine 's demoralized mind . Stopping only to close and lock the door , she rushed across the room to the bed and , dragging the clothes off Peter , promptly emulated the example he had so brilliantly set . " Give me those bedclothes , " grated the gentleman , laying frantic hands on the coverings , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung on grimly . " I wo n't ! " she gasped . " I wo n't ! " " But you 've left me naked as a coot , " cried Peter . " That 's your worry , " she said . " Better you that way than me . " " I do n't know , " replied Peter distractedly . " I ca n't say . Both ways are pretty awful . I do know , however , I 'm not going to lie here like this and argue about it with you . " So saying , he gave the coverings a brutal tug , and Josephine'snaked body appeared as Peter 's burrowed under . It was a scene of desperate activity and concentration . Chivalry and gentleness were sacrificed to meet the demands of modesty . " A nice man , " Josephine panted . " A lecherous little mole of a man . Snatch all the clothes from a naked woman , will you ? Well , we 'll see about that . I 'll have you stripped in the shake of a lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole flock , " came Peter 's muffled voice . " Go away and stop all this talking . " " I should worry how much it shakes . " Jo flung herself at the coverings and neatly twisted them from Peter , wrapping them round herself . " This can keep up forever , " muttered Peter , " until we 're so exhausted we wo n't be able to cover ourselves at all . " " If you hope that 's going to happen you 're very much mistaken , " said Jo . " I 'm under these coverings for good . "   " Do n't see why you 're under them at all , " he protested , churning the air with his hands . " An astonishing thing to do  --  crawling nakedly into bed with a man . " " You crawled nakedly into a closet with me . " " I know , but a closet 's different . " " Why , may I ask ? " " Obviously a closet is not arranged . " " What in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed is always associated with vice and carrying on , " he told her . " You should know that yourself . " " I sleep in my bed , " she replied . " Well , you 're not going to sleep in mine , and that 's flat . " " I 'm not going to do anything else . " " Who wants you to do anything else ? Go on . Go back to your own bed and sleep . " " I ca n't , " she protested . " Perfect strangers keep coming i I was looking for Aspirin Liz when I saw you . Then I said to myself , Any port in a storm , ' and here I am . " " Let me assure you , my girl , " said Peter , hoping to frighten her , " you picked far from a safe anchorage for your body . I 'm drifting into danger myself . " " With you , Peter , " she replied in a voice he both feared and suspected , " I can face any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you might even think up a few . No fooling now . Give me back those bedclothes . It 's your turn to be naked for a while . " " Let 's compromise , " suggested Jo . " We are compromised , " he retorted . " If this gets out we 'll be ostracized for life . " " If what gets out ? " asked the girl , popping up her head interestedly . " This situation , " chattered Peter , flipping over on his stomach like a netted fish without having the comfort of knowing whether he had improved himself any . " Please throw some coverings on me . "   " He wants me to cover him , no less , " she said with nasty derision . " Cover your own vast nudity . I 'm too busy with mine . " By a miracle of contortion Peter succeeded in worming his body beneath the bitterly contested bedclothes only to find himself face to face with his disconcerting bedfellow . " Are n't we in a terrible fix ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " said Jo . " Some persons might not think it so bad . " " You 're awful , " he breathed , looking at her almost with admiration . " I ca n't stand things like this . Actually , I 'm nearly exhausted from excitement . Might swoon at any mo-ment . " " You 're far from complimentary , " she told him , her red head thrust out of the clothing within three inches of his . " What did you think of my one-piece , Peter ? " " From the glance I got , " he said , " you were n't wearing any . " " I certainly was , " she declared . " One piece of skin . " Peter shivered at this . " How you put it ! " he muttered . " Would you ever have believed two days ago that we 'd be like this in the same bed ? " " Yes , " she said without batting an eye . " What ! " exclaimed Peter . " Certainly , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " " Not nice people , " he argued . " Very nice people , " she told him . " Some of the best . " " You mean married , of course . " " Well , that would tidy up the situation a bit , " she replied thoughtfully , " but in view of the extraordinary circumstancesin which we find ourselves through no fault of our own I , for one , am willing to waive certain little formalities , or at least to delay them . "   " You talk too much , " he answered , " altogether too much , and you do n't mean one eighth you say  --  that is , I hope not . " " I 'm not so sure , " said Jo . " Anyway , I know I love you . " " Is this a nice place to tell me that ? " " If I did n't tell you that , " she retorted , " the situation would be just plain wicked . " " I 've never been in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been a shade more remote myself , " she admitted . " When one 's in Rome , however , I suppose one might just as well make hay while the sun shines . " " I 'm under the impression these particular Romans do n't , " said Peter . " The doctor seemed very snooty . " " Do n't what ? " she asked . " You 're always so damn blunt , " he complained . " I mean they do n't make hay . " " Then they do n't sound like Romans to me , " said the girl . " Those old devils were always making hay . " " You carry logic to the point of depravity , " he objected . " I do n't understand , " said Jo . " Well , " he began with an effort , " I do n't quite understandmyself , but it 's like this : Logically speaking , this situationcalls for a certain line of conduct , whereas " Almost demands it , " said Jo . " Do n't interrupt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd get the hell out of here and go back to your own bed . " " But , morally speaking , suppose I was n't a lady ? " she asked . " Then naturally we could n't continue to speak morally , " he replied . " I 'm glad of that , " said Jo , running her fingers through his hair . " Do n't do that , " he told her . " Do n't make the slightest move . "   " Should n't I do this ? " she asked , a white arm slipping snakelike round his neck . " No , " he replied . " Not that nor anything like it . " " What will you give me if I do n't ? " " I have n't a damn thing to give , " gloomed Peter . " They did n't even leave me a check book . If they had I 'd tear out the checks and rig up a girdle for myself . " " You 'd look sweet , " said Jo . " Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 'd feel a lot less public . " " You know those women ? " Jo asked in a conversational voice . " No , " Peter replied . " I do n't . What women ? " " Those women , " Jo went on , " who claim that if their husbandscame home unexpectedly and found them in bed with some man , the husbands would show how evil-minded they were if they thought anything wrong about it  --  do you know those women , Peter ? " " There may be longer and less ably stated hypothetical questions , " replied Peter , " but I never answered one . No . I do n't know those women , thank God . " " Well , what I was trying to say , " she continued , her arm tightening round his neck , " is that I 'm not at all like those women . " " And if I happened to be your husband , " said Peter , " I would n't believe you if you were . " " Then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May I ask what all this is leading up to ? " asked Peter .

" Just like some of the smaller flames of hell or those snake-like locks of Medusa . And your face is baleful , too , in a beautiful sort of way . " P193He was lying on his right side , critically surveying the girl 's face , touching it here and there with an inquiring fingertip . " I do n't know how I can lie here in bed and look at yours , " she told him with a small companionable yawn . " God must have run out of color or lost interest when He came to your hair and eyes . You 're merely tinted . To me you are singularly rabbit-like . " " In what sense , may I ask ? " " In appearance , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee world now . " " No , " he replied . " I have no such exalted aspirations . I am merely a man who will stand for so much and no more . " " It 's too bad you 're not the kind who will go just so far and no further , " Jo retorted . " One can hardly do that with you , " he said easily . " You 'd drag them the rest of the way . " " Oh , so I 'm the responsible party , " she observed , gouging him in the cheek , " while you , you poor dear , are the wronged one . " " Exactly , " was the complacent reply . " I look upon myself , thank God , in the most detached light . Only in a remote way , like an extra on a crowded stage , am I connected with the drama of your inevitable downfall . " " I do n't like that crowded-stage crack , " the girl replied sombrely . " You were the first player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , do n't confuse life with fiction . There 're more ruined women in the world today eating three square meals with an easy conscience than there are homes for wayward girls . " " You 're hard , " said Pete . " No , I 'm not , " she retorted . " I 'm reasonable . And I 'm notat all unromantic . For instance , I think it 's quite beautifulbeing here with you like this . Wo n't forget it for some time . " " When you feel that you 're beginning to , just drop round when you 're not busy and I 'll try to refresh your memory , " said Peter . " You see , " asserted Jo triumphantly , " you 're really the hard-boiled member of this team . Men usually pretend to make quite a fuss over the women they 've ruined . You strike me as being a little proud , a little strutty . " " I confess I do n't know , " he admitted . " No man ever attempted to ruin me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slight feeling of elation . " " As much as I hate to take the wind out of your sails , " she said , " in justice to myself I must remind you that far from being your victim you 're jolly well mine . " " Stuff and nonsense , " scoffed Peter . " You 're merely a butterflyon the wheel , crushed and broken  --  another conquest , no more and no less . " " You 'll be crushed and broken , you little coffee bean , " she retorted hotly , " if you do n't watch your step . I ruined you , my lad . You did n't ruin me . " " It hardly seems sensible to be lying here disputing over which of us ruined the other , " he remarked . " It 's a highly technical question . " " My eye , it is , " exclaimed Jo . " You 're damn well seduced and I did it . " " Have it your way , " he said amiably . " Just so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care much who it is . " " Oh , you do n't , " she snapped . " Just like a man . Ruination means nothing to you . " " Inasmuch as you insist on me being the ruined party , " he mildly protested , " I 'm doing my best to be as cheerful as possible among all the debris . " " And succeeding almost too well , " she retorted . " One would think you actually enjoyed it . " " Well , " confessed Peter ruminatively , " you must admit it has its lighter side . "   " I admit nothing , " she said . " Under the circumstances that would perhaps be best , " he agreed . " In fact , I 'd deny everything , if you do n't mind an impersonal suggestion . " " I 'm telling Yolanda right off , " she told the man with malicious enjoyment . " Then I 'm going to tell the Bishop , and after that I 'm going to get him to marry you to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seduce him , too ? " " If necessary . " " Rather than that should happen , I 'll marry you , if not of my own free will at least without public lamentation . " " Then you do care ! " cried Jo , impulsively flinging herself upon him . " How sweet ! " " I was thinking of the Bishop , " he protested , making a poor showing of warding off her flashing arms . Fortunately for this record Josephine 's hoydenish activities were interrupted by a peremptory knocking on the door which was followed by the command of a stern voice . The sound of the knocking returned to Peter a terrible realization of the situation in which he found himself . And with the arrival of this realization his presence of mind departed . In a naked panic he sprang from the bed . " Open the door ! " cried the voice . " This is strictly against the rules . Open the door immediately . " " I do n't know the rules , " chattered Peter . " You should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice replied in high reproof . " My God , " muttered Peter , his face blanching . " The whole world seems to know already . Like what ? " he asked aloud . " Do n't quibble with me , young man , " said the voice . " If you do n't open this door I 'll have it broken down . Is there a woman in there with you ? " " What made you get that quaint idea ? " asked Peter , motioningJo to silence .   " There 's a girl missing , " came the answer . " And sometimesnew arrivals carry on . " " Carry on how ? " called Peter , sparring desperately for time . " When were you born ? " queried the voice . " This is hardly the proper moment for vital statistics , " retorted Peter . " Go away and leave that door alone . " Fresh voices could be heard in the hall  --  the patter of bare feet . There were sounds of suppressed laughter and giggling  --  frolicsome slaps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pictured a mass of naked bodies waiting outside the door to witness his disgrace . The pounding was resumed . In his desperation he forgot his wounded arm and began to tear a sheet in strips , thoughtfully putting one aside . " What are you doing that for ? " Jo asked in a low voice . " Through the window , " he told her . " Tie the blankets to-gether . " " I mean the sheet you put aside , " said the girl . " I 'm going to wear that , " he replied briefly . " What about me ? " she asked . " Have n't time to think of that now , " he muttered . " I 'm much too busy . " " Sir Galahad in the flesh , " she said in an awful whisper as she sprang from the bed . " A link nude coward . " Busily she began to tie the blankets together as the poundingwas redoubled on the door . " Open this door , I tell you ! " cried the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be doing ? " " Use your imagination , " snapped Peter . " It seems fairly obvious , " shouted the voice on a note of bitterness . " Here goes the door . " A resounding thud shook the door as Peter grabbed the blankets from Joe , added his strip to them , and , securing one end of the rude line to a leg of the bed , tossed the other end out of the window . Twisting the remaining sheet roundP195his body in bizarre tufts and slashes , he hurried to the window . " One moment , my small Mahatma , " said Jo in a low , unpleasantvoice . " Are you planning on leaving me behind ? " " Not making any plans for you , " he replied . " I 'm simply taking care of myself . " Without even glancing down to see what fate lay below him , Peter seized the knotted bedclothing and disappeared through the window , his wounded arm paining unnoticed beneath its bandage . " Damned if I 'll let him get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain for some garment to wear in her flight . " Honor is lost , but pride dies hard . " She ran to the window , and with a prayer in her heart to the god of impulsive maidens , lowered herself on the strip . Peter , glancing up with a strained face , almost lost his grip . More stunned by what he saw above than by what he feared below , he continued on his way , grimly wondering the while if the world had ever witnessed so indecent an escape staged in any language . Jo speedily overtook the queer-looking object below her . Soon she was ready to pass him , but hardly in a position to do so . " Ca n't you find some place to sit on , other than my head ? " Peter inquired wanly . " How can I ? " she called down . " I do n't know , " he replied . " That 's what I 'm asking you . " " I 'm doing my best , " she assured him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you want to know , you 're doing your best to crush me to earth . " For answer Jo reached down with a momentarily freed hand and snatched the sheet from his body . Peter emitted a small shriek of dismay . " There are too many people on the lawn , " she told him . " I need this . "   " Ca n't see a thing for your feet , " he got out . " They 're dangling in my eyes . " " You must look pretty from down there , " she retorted . " From here you 're nothing to sneeze at , yourself , " he retorted . " A lot of people are looking down at me , " said Jo . " A lot of faces from your window . They 're furious . " " They 'd be frozen from this end , " he assured her . " Wish I were back in the fog . " His wish was almost granted , for Jo , twisting the ends of the sheet round her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continue on over part of Peter 's . The effect was astounding . It was that of a creature or thing that had started out in life as a red-headed woman and who at some time during the stages of a strangely attenuated evolutionhad decided to finish off her already sufficiently bewilderingbody with the long and skinnily dangling legs and feet of a man . The great expanse of mysteries that lay between the flaming head and shrinking feet was luckily more or less hidden from view by the frantically fluttering sheet . As this weird , synthetic figure crawled lumpily down the strip of bedclothing , new arrivals on the lawn were almosttoo frightened to ask what it was . They seemed to prefer to remain in ignorance rather than to face what could not be otherwise than a decidedly unpleasant fact . " How much farther do we have to go ? " asked Josephine , her strength rapidly failing . " By this method not much farther , I fear , " Peter drearily communicated through the sheet . " I 'm about ready to fall to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , before I go I 'd like to say how greatly I 've enjoyed your comfortablerest on my head . You seem to think I 'm an elevator . " " Hurry up ! " cried Jo . " If I start to fall I 'm going to take you with me . " " There is a sea of faces below , " he informed her . " I 'd like P197to fall on all of them , but their mouths are shockingly filled with teeth . " " You mean dogs ? " asked Jo . " Worse than dogs , " said Peter . " Naked bodies that once were human . " As if by special arrangement the sheet parted a moment , and Peter found himself gazing in through a window on a scene of domestic activity . A lady was drying herself with a towel while her husband , or rather , one whom Peter piously hoped was her husband , was busily combining the worst featuresof a setting-up exercise with those of an interpretive dance . Upon seeing Peter , they both nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided this manifestation was sufficiently interesting to justify closer examination . They hurried to the window . " I thought you were one , " the man called down to Peter . " Oh , no , " replied Peter , halting his descent . " I 'm at least two. , , " I mean , " said the man , " there 's something above in a sheet . " " There is , indeed , " answered Peter . " You do n't know what all there is in that sheet . " " Are you exercising ? " asked the dripping woman . " Is this some new wrinkle ? " " I 'm wrinkled all over , lady , " came the voice of Jo , " and every wrinkle hurts . " " If you really want to know , " called Peter , " we 're trying to escape . " " From what on earth ? " asked the man . " Oh , everything , " said Peter . " All things on earth . " " From our thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the wet woman to her husband . " This place will do them a world of good . " Peter laughed wildly . " It 's helped us a lot already , " he said . " Morally as well as physically we feel like giants refreshed  --  likea couple of shooting stars , in fact . " Suddenly his voice took on a note of anguish . " I 'm going , Jo , " he called . " Here drops nothing . My arm 's gone bad . " As Jo reached down to grab him , she felt herself being dragged from the line , and even as she fell through space she managed to find some comfort in the thought of what a low hound Peter Duane Van Dyck was to have pulled her with him . They landed amid a lot of naked bodies , bearing some of them with them to the ground , upon which they lay for one startled moment ; then , springing up , dashed across the grass in the direction of the nearest trees . The naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another like sportivemaniacs . And that was more or less what Peter judged them to be , only he was not so sure how long they would remainin a state of amiable hilarity . The pack of them might undergo a sudden change of mood and rend him limb from limb . There was no room in his thoughts at the moment for the safety of Josephine 's limbs . Embarrassment added to fear forms a sufficiently strong combination to demoralize the stoutest of souls . Dressed , Peter might have been willing to turn and face the world . Naked , he had only one idea , and that was to let the world and all its works very much alone . Peter might have achieved his burning ambition  --  the blessed protection of those trees  --  and so might Josephine , his nearest rival ; this temporary relief might have been vouchsafed them had it not been for the intervention of an unkind fate in the guise of ebullient flesh and lots of it . It so happened that as Peter was passing a large , formal flower bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amazing agility set himself in motion to spoil Peter 's plans . " A chase ! " cried the man , dancing delightedly after Peter . " Watch me catch you . "  | " Not for a moment , " Peter jerked out . " Go chase your-self . " " This , " replied the man , leaving the ground and landing on Peter 's back , " is much more fun . " " Damned if I see it , " muttered Peter as he fell earthward on his nose . " Caught ! " cried his excited antagonist . " Now you chase me . " So saying , he sprang up and , taking a return pursuit for granted , sprinted busily across the lawn . Peter followed the man 's example but not his direction . " If he 's foolish enough to think I 'm going to chase him , " Peter reflected , " he 's due for a bitter disappointment . " At this moment his speed was checked by the sound of a desperate cry . " Help , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back I 'll tell them what you did . " Peter came back . In fact , he hurried back . Although he could not see Josephine , he had , from the noise she was making , a general idea of her whereabouts . She was under the large body of an exceedingly active woman . The mere thought of laying violent hands on so much bare flesh to which he had never been properly introduced somewhat retardedPeter 's celerity of decision . Tentatively he grabbed the twisting woman , then quickly withdrew his hand . The physical contact had been too much for his nerve centres . " Come on , " panted the woman , seizing his ankles . " I 'll get you down , too . " And get him down she did . She got him down and literallyincorporated him into the gyrating mass of bodies , arms and legs . He had never realized before that there could be so much unclad flesh in any given quarter of the universe . Even then in this primitive struggle Peter strove to conduct himself as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a gentleman should accomplishthis was beyond his conception . However , as the woman 's grabs and thrusts became more careless and at the same time more telling , Peter began to realize that if the last surviving male of one of New York 's oldest families desiredto acquit himself with honors he must abandon the restraint of a lifetime and do his level best . He must fight fire with fire , which in this situation meant to seize upon whatever part of the woman lay most convenient to his hand . Comforting himself with the reflection that she had exercised little restraint in the handling of his body , he rose and , takinghold of the woman , threw her several feet away . She landed with a gurgle of laughter and promises of further endeavors . " Listen , lady , " said Jo , hoisting herself up wearily from the grass by means of Peter 's leg , an action which in other surroundings would have filled him with consternation , but which in these he scarcely noticed . " Please , lady , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not . " " You give in ? " cried the woman , gathering herself for a fresh assault . Then the Van Dyck blood rose rebelliously in Peter 's veins . Naked or fully clad , a Van Dyck would never give in . Either naked or clad , it was a rare Van Dyck indeed who had ever given anything . Van Dycks always took . So would this one . He took to his heels without further parley , and Josephine took right after him . " They 're trying to play with us , Peter , " she explained , a shade above her labored breathing . " It 's all a game to them . " " It may be a game to them , " he flung back , " but it 's serious as hell to me . Hurry up . Get a move on . That woman was simply awful . She was all everything . " " Was n't she lots ? " agreed Jo . " Where 're we going , Peter ? "   " How should I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be dashing gayly from the wings of the Follies . " " The seduction scene in this drama , " said Jo , " was enjoyableif not edifying . I can see some sense in a thing like that , but this naked chase is beyond me . " " If you had n't sneaked into my room , " complained Peter , " this would not have happened . " " Then do you admit you were seduced ? " she asked . " Is this a time to argue about that ? " Peter demanded , glancing over his shoulder at their pursuers , now close at their heels . " It 's no go , " he continued , pausing to let the girl overtakehim . " Those naked fanatics can run like hell . We 'll never make the woods . " " I do n't see what good it would do if we did , " Josephine asserted . " We could climb trees , " Peter suggested dubiously , " or dodge about behind them . " " Playing Adam and Eve among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Josephine assured him crisply . " Both are exploded theories . " " My education along certain lines is less extensive than yours , it seems , " was Peter 's tart rejoinder . " Well , " replied Jo , " be that as it may , but if anyone had told me a few days ago I 'd be spending the week-end arguingabout such matters with a naked gentleman in the face of an onrushing multitude of naked lunatics , I 'd have said that only the first part was either possible or desirable . " " Occasionally I 've dreamed about situations just like this , " said Peter . " Was I along in those dreams ? " Jo asked . " Do n't let 's run any more . " " Those dreams were bad enough , " he replied , " without you making them any worse . And we 're not running , if you care to know . My arm hurts like hell . " " It 's bleeding , " said Jo , a spark of concern in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I was n't so worried about my own condition I 'd be worried about yours . " " I 'd like to wind the bandage around me , " said Peter . " It 's not doing any good where it is , " replied Jo . " Want me to do it for you ? " " God , no ! " exclaimed Peter , bending on her a pair of agitated eyes . " What a suggestion to make . " " Why do n't they come and get us ? " asked the girl . " Look ! They 've gone into a huddle . " " A pretty sight , " mused Peter , gazing upon the nude grouping . " Wonder what they 're cooking up ? " He was not long in learning . Suddenly the intimate lit , le mass of bodies resolved itself into individual nudes who gallopedtowards Jo and Peter . In a moment the two of them were surrounded by a dancing garland of men and women , all singing lustily a song which even in his own embarrassmentmade Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am coming , I am coming , for the dew is on my feet , " the singers informed the semi-crouching couple in the centre of the whirling circle of arms and legs and everything else . " I do n't give a damn what 's on your feet , " Peter yelled back , " if you 'd only let me stagger away on mine . " " I am coming , I am coming , where the little birdies tweet , " the naked dancers went on melodiously to explain . " Are n't they silly ? " Peter asked , turning to the girl beside him . " Honestly , they almost make me forget the figure I cut . " " The trouble with this arrangement , " Jo complained , " is that when you turn your back on some of them you turn your front to the others . It 's the viciousest damn circle I 've ever been in . " " Then why not stand still ? " said Peter . " I 'd like to lie down , " she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Flat on our stomachs . " " I think I 'll curl , " said Jo .   " I 'd like to wither , " said Peter . And to the surprise of their prancing entertainers , Jo and Peter thereupon lay down on the grass and arranged their respective bodies according to their conception of what the occasion demanded and what was best to conceal . P204The Bishop Insists on His DrawersTHE NAKED PEOPLE , WHEN THEY SAW THEIR QUARRY GOto earth , promptly lost interest in dancing and stood gazing down at the two strangely twisted figures with friendly concern . " What 's the matter ? " one of them asked . " Resting ? " Peter groaned aloud at this , and Josephine , a small white ball , giggled to herself at the questioner 's simplicity .  | " No , " she replied . " We 're looking for edelweiss . " " Edelweiss grows in the Alps , " the man informed her . " Does it ? " Jo said innocently . " Then if you 'll go your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong , " another voice declared . " I suppose it would be quite hopeless , " said Peter , bitterly addressing his words to a cluster of bare feet . " I daresay it would be positively ridiculous to try to make you understand even the most obvious things that are wrong with the situa-tion . " " Not at all , " a pair of feet replied . " We 're an exceptionally intelligent group . " " I do n't see how that can be , " protested Peter . " Tearing about all exposed is n't especially intelligent . " " In pairs it might be , Peter , " said Jo , " but not in large , impersonal masses . " " So that 's it ! " cried a voice . " You do n't like being naked , eh ? Embarrasses you ? " " Worse than that , " said Peter . " It paralyzes me . " " If you ca n't guess what 's wrong with us , " Josephine offered , " I 'll tell you under three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : We 're naked . B : You 're naked . C : We 're all naked together . And if that does n't make it clear , I 'll toss in another letter . D : There is n't so much as a doll 's handkerchief to cover a dozen adult members of the male , female , and indeterminate sexes . " " There 's more of us than that , " someone remarked . " Well , after you 've reached a dozen naked bodies , " replied Jo , " it takes a cooler brain than mine to keep an accurate count . " " Tell ' em to go away , Jo , " said Peter . " I do n't like it here . " " Go away , " Jo told the naked people . " He does n't like it here . The grass tickles . " " I did n't say that , " said Peter . " However , it does . "   " What 's wrong with him now ? " asked a female member of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've lost everything but an audience , " Peter retorted . " And I do n't want that . Honor , hope , and decency are gone , all gone . I wish you would go , too . " " If you do n't like being naked , " inquired a hitherto silent member of the group , " why did you come here ? " " Did n't know anything about it , " declared Peter . " I was partly drunk and partly delirious , and I wish to God I was in that happy state right now . " " Yes , " supplied Josephine . " We were lured into this fix : A fully clad gentleman met us on the beach and offered us the hospitality of his home overnight . When I woke up , my clothes were gone . Immediately I suspected a bad house . I still do , a little . " " Mine were gone , too , " proclaimed Peter dramatically , " and in their place was a man  --  a naked man with a funny little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing in the morning ! A naked man with a black bag . My word ! " " That would be our doctor , " a voice said proudly . " He pretty nearly made a wreck of me , " snapped Peter . " Yes . That was Dr. Wolf , " another voice declared . " He looked like one , " replied Peter , " without the sheep 's clothing . " " He 's a very nice doctor , " cried a girlish voice . " He believesin nuts . " " So do I , " said Peter , " after this morning . " " You 're actually brilliant , Peter , " Josephine told him . " lf they 'd provide us with a pair of blankets we could talk like this indefinitely . " " Then you are not voluntary nudists , we take it ? " a lady inquired . " That 's right , lady , " put in Jo . " You can take it or leave it . Lying here naked like this is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "   " Well , " announced a new voice authoritatively , " you 'll have to come along now voluntarily or otherwise . The leader wants to see you . " " The leader ? " laughed Jo sarcastically . " Do you mean that smooth little snake in the grass who lured us into his establishment ? If so , I 'm anxious to see him , too . I 'll claw the clothes from his body . " " He does n't wear any , " continued the man . " He did last night , " said Jo . " I know , " continued the other impatiently . " He had just returned from a trip to town . Now he 's like the rest of us . " " He wo n't be long , " cried Jo , thoughtlessly springing up in her eagerness for action . " His skin will be in shreds when I get through with him  --  in tatters . " " I wo n't get up , " groaned Peter . " I ca n't get up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we call on this procureralone ? " " You seem to have got used to the little lady , " said an insinuating voice . " She 's an old friend , " explained Peter . " She knew my father . " " And I fancy he would approve of your conduct ? " the voice continued . " You were in the same room together behind a locked door . " " Sure , " retorted Peter . " My father used to do that him-self . " " How do you mean ? He used to do what ? " " Why go into details ? " cried Peter . " He was a man who craved privacy  --  liked naked bodies and everything behind locked doors . " " We go in for naked bodies here , " the man replied , " and leave everything else alone . " " That hardly seems logical , " said Jo . " If true , why the naked bodies ? Strikes me as living in the lap of an anti-climax . "  | " We dance and exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't tell me that , " declared Jo , warming to the argument . " When God made a man and woman He had a lot more in His mind than dancing and silly exercises . He might not have said it in so many words , being quite content to leave a few things to the imagination . " " I wo n't attempt to explain , " replied the man with offendeddignity . " I fear it would be quite useless . " Here he paused and turned to two companions . " If you two , " he resumed , will be good enough to drag that body up from the grass we will bring it along with us . " " Keep your hands off of me , " cried Peter . " If I must get up I 'll do so under my own steam . " Painfully Peter rose from the grass and stood huddled up beside Josephine , his eyes ruefully fixed on his feet . A realizationof the ordered madness of life was growing in his mind . He had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuit of a **26;1529;TOOLONG . Destiny , seeing in him a willing subject , had since that unconsidered moment done with him as it pleased . What , exactly , would Aunt Sophie or Sanders do under similar conditions ? It stultified his imagination to think of them standing naked on a lawn in the presence of a group of equally naked strangers . How was Yolanda taking it ? Not at all well , he felt sure . Not nearly so well as Josephine , but then the latter was of different clay  --  much coarser and nicer . The naked people gathered companionably round him  --  too companionably for Peter 's comfort . In spite of his morning'sintroduction to the flesh he still shrank from promiscuouscontact with it , still objected to being bumped and jostled by naked bodies . Such alarming experiences were occurring with increasing frequency as the party approached the long white house . Deep verandas flared from its sides upon the cool green of the lawn  --  deep verandas with well-P209tailored awnings picked out in stripes of white and orange . " Not unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awnings . " Wish I had a pair right now , " was Peter 's wistful answer . " They would give me a slight shade of moral ascendancyat least . " " If you ca n't maintain your morals naked , " a tall scholarly individual cut in , " you will lose them entirely when dressed . " " That , " said Peter , " would disturb me very little . I do n't care how many morals I lose so long as I retrieve my clothes . " " Not an edifying attitude , " replied the man . " Why do n't you stand erect like the rest of us ? Why not throw out your chest and shoulders ? You walk like a man with knots in his bowels . " " What ! " Peter almost screamed , recoiling from the speaker 's side . " A man with knots in his what ? No . Do n't speak . I 'd rather you would n't . " " My friend finds your words even less comforting than your body , " Josephine informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's disgraceful , " muttered Peter , " the way these men and women strut along just as if nothing was wrong with them . They throw everything out  --  chests and all . Wherever I turn my eyes some horrid section of anatomy fairly leaps into view . " " But you really are walking like a camel in labor , " Josephinereminded him . " If I could walk with my head between my legs I 'd feel all dressed up , " said Peter . " That sight would be even more memorable than the presentone , " his red-headed companion replied . By this time they had reached the house , which they entered , only to find themselves in the presence of a fresh burst of nudity . Naked people were sitting , squatting , and reclining wherever Peter tried to rest his eyes from the sight of flesh . Had he been able to discover the Bishop bereftP210of garments he might have found some comfort there . Even an unclad Aspirin Liz would have provided a slight kick , but the only member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . This small individual was standing miserably behind a high-back chair , and Peter could not but envy the felon 's tactical position . The room was long , low , and raftered . It was luxuriously furnished and decorated with quiet good taste . There was nothing mad about the room , a fact which rather than comfortingPeter increased his sense of alarm . Perhaps these peopleinstead of being crazy were merely depraved . A smut bronzed gentleman , Peter noticed , was reading the financial section of the morning paper with as much absorption as if he had been fully clad . Peter could not understand it . At a small table a huge gray-haired lady whose seemingly endless expanses of flesh should have been covered by yards of black brocaded satin was diligently cheating her way through some involved game of solitaire . True to form , reflected Peter , if not to convention . Still another figure  --  a sharp-cornered gentleman dressed only in a pencil  --  was engrossed in a crosswordpuzzle . He was entirely unconscious of his surroundings . Scattered here and there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisting it in odd fashions . A man wearing only a pink beret was making a sketch from which Peter promptly turned his eyes . Several men were standing in a group by a large buffet . They were engaged in drinking coffee , and one of them was asserting that Al Smith might still have a chance to be President if he would discard his brown derby . In view of the fact that the speaker had discardedeverything himself , Peter decided he was exercising admirable restraint in regard to the ex-governor 's wearing apparel . Peter would not have been at all surprised had the man stated that if Al Smith discarded all his clothes he could walk into the White House , the unanimous choice of allP211parties . Through a long window he could see a number of naked children wandering about the lawn . They did not seem elated . Some of the older ones , Peter thought , looked far more self-conscious than their elders . Evidently they had not yet been entirely claimed by the general depravity . This was quite natural , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the most arresting figure in the room was that of a young man reclining a little apart from the others on a large divan . Even in his unclad state there was a sense of satanic polish about this person . In his eyes dwelt a dangerouslyamused light , and his agreeable-looking mouth seemed capable of uttering quite acceptably the most objectionable blasphemies . Dark hair and dark eyes , remarkably fine , white teeth . The only suggestion of degeneracy about him , Peter concluded , was a duck , a large , self-possessed-looking bird squatting by its master , its long purple neck extended snakelikeacross the man 's flanks . This duck had a pair of the most disconcertingly probing eyes Peter had ever seen in the head of man or beast . These bright beady eyes were now turned on Peter , who felt with an uneasy pang that they were readinghim through and through and not altogether approving of the subject matter . Nor was there anything degenerate in either the duck 's manner or appearance . It was the bond of perfect understanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About both of them there was something severely sinister . For some reason the man 's naked body suggested a perfectly fitting dress suit , while the duck brought to mind visions of some especially discreditable form of witchcraft . " My name is Jones , " said the suave-looking individual on the divan in a detached yet decently cultivated voice . " You are perhaps wondering , my dear sir , and also you , my redheadedyoung lady , how a person as naked as myself could bear such a simple name as Jones . However , as you growP2I2 to know me better you will understand that simplicity is the keynote of my character . My duck waddles through her days quite cheerfully with the name of Havelock Ellis . A pardonable whim of mine . Her attitude is so opposed to the Dance of Life . " " All this information may seem important to you , " Peter replied in the true Van Dyck manner , " but to us it is ponderouslysuperfluous . What is important to us is the whereaboutsof our clothes and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of Little Arthur , while the duck , slightly elevating her sleek head , looked directly at the partly concealed criminal as if he were one bug too many . " Is that one of your friends ? " asked Jones . " Do n't hesitate to admit it if he is . Almost any peculiarity passes uncriticizedhere . " " That 's just as well , " Josephine spoke up . " Otherwise you 'd be too busy . " " Yes , " agreed the gentleman called Jones . " We would . But to return to that strange , almost human object " " Cut out yer wisecracking , " retorted Little Arthur . " You 're no better than a naked lounge lizard yourself . " " If as good , " replied Jones easily ; then , turning once more to Peter : " Your other three friends seem disinclined to leave their rooms . You two , I understand , succeeded in visiting each other . For your sakes as well as ours we wo n't go into that . We will try not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why we should longer deprive ourselves of the company of your friends . We shall send for them . " Jones clapped his hands , and two oppressively large-lookingindividuals appeared at his summons . They were innocent of garments but not unconscious of their absence . At that they were more fully clad than the others , being decoratedwith light blue armbands , the uniform dress of atten-dants. '  | " Drag ' em down , boys , " Jones told them briefly . The boys paddled heavily up a long flight of stairs , and presently sounds of vituperation were heard in the hall above . " Keep your nasty talons off me , " came the voice of Aspirin Liz . " I 've been naked in front of real gentlemen , I 'll have you tD understand , and they never laid a hand on me unless " At this point in Liz 's narrative there was a momentarypause , then she resumed : " It 's none of your filthy business . I 've learned some mighty dirty tricks in my time , you pot-bellied bucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play them all at once . " Apparently the boys must have doubted the extent of the model 's learning , for the next few moments were devoted to deep-throated cries of anguish and indignation . " I wonder what she could have done to them ? " Jones mused aloud to his duck , who significantly lowered the lids over two yellow eyes . At this moment Aspirin Liz , shaking with coarse laughter , appeared at the head of the staircase . Holding with one hand to the banister , she slapped with the other enough thigh to make at least three of the average large woman , which , it must be admitted , is a stupefying amount of thigh . " For once I do n't need an aspirin , " she announced mirthfullyto the company below . " That did me a world of good . " " May I ask what you did to my men ? " Jones asked , considering the figure with respectful eyes . This question produced in Liz another spasm of mirth . " Better ask them , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did plenty . And I 'll do the same to you if you lay a hand on me . " Even the imperturbable Jones appeared to be momentarily disconcerted by this possibility . " I shall endeavor to restrain my eager hands , " he assured her as the mountain of a woman moved down the stairs . " Oh ? dear , " she exclaimed , catching sight of Josephine andP2I4surveying her with critical approval . " What a glorious figure you have , child . Why , you should go naked all the time . And if it is n't Mr. Van Dyck himself all undressed and no place to go . " " That 's just the trouble , Liz , " said Peter . " There 's no place to go  --  nowhere to turn . " " Cheer up , " Aspirin Liz replied in her hearty voice as she joined them before the divan . " Look at me . I 'm three times as naked as you are  --  that is , I 'm showing three times as much  --  and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Peter told her . " The relatively small amount I am showing bothers me a lot . " " That 's because you never posed in the nude , " Liz assured him . " You 'll quickly get used to all this . It does n't matter a : all . And who may this naked reptile be ? Did he send tho heels after me ? " " I realize my mistake too late , " murmured Jones . " I ' sorry , madam . " " It 's too late for them , " Liz retorted . " They 'll never be the same . " Looking as if Liz had spoken nothing but the truth , the two attendants weakly appeared on the stairs and stood looking down with pain-ravaged eyes upon the room below . The two men were in turn subjected to the interested scrutiny of many pairs of eyes intent on ascertaining the full extent of the calamity that had befallen them . " The lady is locked in her room , " said one of the men in a hoarse voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag her out , Mr. Jones . The other party who calls himself a bishop says he wo n't come down unless we give him back his drawers . " A lean , sun-tanned person bearing the head of a Greek philosopher now spoke . " If the gentleman is a bishop , " he observed in a deep musical voice , " I think he should be allowed his drawers if only out of respect for his cloth . " P2I5 " It does seem as if the situation justifies a slight deviation from our usual custom , " Jones replied . " We have never had a bishop with us before , and I say better a bishop in drawers than no bishop at all . " " Give the Bishop back his drawers , " several voices readily responded . " We want to see him . " " It seems agreed , " continued Jones , " that the Bishop should retain his drawers . Very well , boys . Give him back his drawers and leave the lady alone until you feel a little stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er  --  let us say , painfully primitive methods of retaliation . " A short time thereafter the Bishop , clothed in jaegers and righteous wrath , stood at the head of the stairs and like Moses from the mountain looked scornfully down on his naked audience . " Although they are only drawers , " Mr. Jones observed coolly , " there seems to be no end to them . " " My dear Bishop , " exclaimed a lady volubly , " what a remarkablepair of drawers you are wearing . Tell me . Do n't they tickle ? " " Probably the Bishop is thick-skinned , " put in Jones , thoughtfully scratching his duck 's head . " Bishops usually get that way . " " There is nearly enough material in those drawers , " drawled a voice , " to make all of us in this room feel almost overdressed . " " There 's not enough material in all the world to make me feel overdressed , " said Peter . " As silly-looking as those drawers may be , I long to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in drawers like those , " Josephine declared , " there 'd be no room for you in my life . " " I 'm not usually found in my drawers , " replied Peter . " No , " Jo admitted with confounding simplicity . " I never found you in a pair except once in the office . " " Do n't let them kid you , Bishop , " Aspirin Liz called en- couragingly . " I 've seen more peculiar-looking drawers than those in my day . " " Thank you , madam , " said the Bishop icily . " It must have been a mirthful day , " the philosophical gentleman observed . " There ai n't a thing funny about them drawers , " Little Arthur suddenly and sincerely proclaimed from behind his chair . " If anyone gave me my choice of drawers , I 'd pick out a pair exactly like them  --  only lots smaller ! " " Of course , " murmured Mr. Jones politely . " The mere sight of them makes me feel like panting . " Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a gesture that had silenced many a godless congregationbefore as it now silenced this one spread out nakedly at his feet . " It is a sad commentary indeed , " he said in a voice vibrant with emotion , " on your good taste as well as moral character that of you all only a recently converted criminal has sufficientdiscernment to recognize an honest pair of drawers when he sees one . " " What did I tell yer ? " put in Little Arthur complacently . " You said it , Bishop . Them are good , honest drawers , yer reverence . " " Even better than that , Little Arthur , " amended Bishop Waller , his voice rich with pride and approval . " They are quality drawers , my man . No finer jaegers made . " " And certainly no funnier , " a brazen voice put in . " Do n't listen to them , yer honor  --  I mean yer reverence , " the small crook continued heavily on the side of righteousness . " They ai n't got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't even a blessed pocket in the whole horrid outfit . " " Ah ! " exclaimed the Bishop , beaming brightly upon his disreputable little convert . " No pockets at all . What a relief that must be for you , my fine fellow . No pockets at all  --  a blessing in disguise . "  | " This lot do n't even trouble to disguise , " Little Arthur muttered as his glance drifted disgustedly about the room . " Nevertheless , " went on the good Bishop , " God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform . " Little Arthur looked a trifle shocked . He hated to think of God as having had anything to do with this stark naked household . " Perhaps , " he agreed rather gloomily . " He 's certainly made it impossible for me to perform any of my wonders . Yards and yards of naked flesh where pockets ought to be . What a place for a dip ! " " An ex-dip , Little Arthur , " heartily replied the Bishop . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At this point in the conversation Mr. Jones rose gracefullyfrom the divan and , carrying Havelock Ellis carelessly under one arm , advanced to the foot of the stairs , where he stood looking courteously up at the Bishop , who in turn had descended a few steps . " Bishop Waller , " said Mr. Jones in a voice of the most convincing sincerity , " believe me , sir , we consider ourselves greatly honored to add one of your exalted station to our little group . " " Your naked rout , " the Bishop corrected . " I refuse to be added to it . " " I hope you will later revise your judgment , " said Mr. Jones . " And I trust you will also believe me when I say that it was not our intention to imply that your drawers were not strictly honest . " " Of course they 're honest , " exploded the Bishop . " But why waste time discussing my drawers when you are not wearing so much as a glove ? " " Quite , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your drawers would be unusually honest . As you say , there is really no need to discuss them . " " I do n't hold with you there , " broke in the man with the philosopher 's head . " To advance as a premise that , because a man is honest himself , the drawers he is wearing are equally honest , is entirely false and indefensible . In actual fact the wearer of the drawers may have a character of the highest integrity , whereas the drawers themselves may be utterly vile . " " I beg your pardon , " expostulated the Bishop . " By that I mean , my dear sir , " the philosopher continued , " the drawers may be the product of non-union labor , of intolerable factory conditions , of unfair price competition , sweat-shop methods , horrid industrial slavery  --  who knows ? There are more ways of making drawers dishonest than one . " " There 's only one really diverting way , " Josephine vouchsafed . Aspirin Liz looked at the girl for a moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the divan the impeccable Jones had abandoned and covered his face with his hands . He was too much of a coward to show in public his appreciation of Jo 's unconscious revelation . The duck was looking at Aspirin Liz with glassily staring eyes . As accustomed as the bird was to flesh , she found it objectionable to contemplate so much of it in one body , one huge , swaying , cascading figure . " That last remark may be stricken from the records , " Mr. Jones resumed imperturbably , " if not from our minds . Let me go on to state , Bishop Waller , that the subject of your drawers would not have been brought up at all had it not been for our realization that to ignore totally a manifestation so peculiar  --  perhaps unique would be a better word  --  would have been so unnatural a suppression of emotion as to become in itself noticeable . You yourself , sir , might have experienced a sense of having been cheated , and that would have been too bad . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all sure in what spirit to accept the invitation of the polished speaker , was about to comply ratherp219than to stand isolated any longer on the stairs , when further independent action was taken out of his hands . The wild cry of a desperate woman suddenly rang through the house . Turning , he was electrified to see Yolanda Wilmont , in a disheveled condition , appear waveringly at the head of the stairs hardly a foot in advance of an extremely active and naked man . After this the good Bishop saw nothingsave a swiftly revolving universe composed entirely of stairs and contorted members of the human body . He was brought back to an unpleasant awareness of his surroundingsby a sensation of insecurity round his waistline and a violent tugging at the back . Havelock Ellis , the duck , excited beyond endurance by the turmoil of the triple descent , had launched herself into action which centred itself on the rear part of the excellent Bishop 's jaegers . Also , in the course of his swift passage down the stairs the Bishop had sustained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of losing his only protection , yet disinclined to remain prostratedand endure the envenomed assaults of the duck , Bishop Waller found himself in the unique position of one being torn on the horns of a dilemma about midway between Scylla and Charybdis . It is a position that even a bishop can scarcely face with an overabundance of fortitude . Bishop Waller feared that his supply was being rapidly exhausted . " Will someone give me a safety pin , " he asked in a weak voice , " and at the same time remove this infuriated duck ? " " Why , Havelock Ellis is actually pecking at the Bishop , " a voice exclaimed . " Both actually and viciously , " gasped the Bishop . " And in an exceedingly mortifying spot , let me assure you . " " There could be worse , " the philosopher observed . " Let 's not become involved in a long academic discussion as to what part of one 's body is the most mortifying to have pecked by a duck , " protested the Bishop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the spot this duck is at present pecking with the utmost determination is both mortifying and painful enough to convince even the most skeptical observer that something should be done about it . And , " added the Bishop , " done without delay . " " You have convinced me , " said the philosopher . " Thank God for that , " murmured the Bishop . " And the pin ? The pin is most essential . " Now , to find a safety pin in a nudist colony is a task that would baffle the best minds of Scotland Yard . So hopeless was it that no one present made any attempt to look for one . Instead , Peter removed what remained of the bandage from his wounded arm and passed it to the red-headed girl who in turn conveyed it to the Bishop . " Thanks , my dear , " said the Bishop , eagerly snatching the bandage from her hand . " God will forgive you much for this . " " There will still remain plenty to be forgiven , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , " replied the Bishop , securing his jaegers with the bandage . " We will deal with that later if someone will collect this bird whose egg was indubitably hatched in hell . " Mr. Jones thereupon collected the squawking Havelock Ellis and at the same time assisted the Bishop to stagger to his feet . " There are holes in the back , perhaps ? " the Bishop delicatelysuggested in a low voice . Mr. Jones , cocking his head at an angle , took a quick survey of the recent scene of action . " No holes , " he murmured to the Bishop . " I find that difficult to believe , " said the reverend gentleman . " There would have been soon  --  a great many , I feel assured . These jaegers , my dear Mr. Jones , are but recently purchased . " " They are exquisite , " replied Mr. Jones.  |p22IYolanda  furiously confronted the speaker . She had been too long neglected . " Does it matter to you if I 'm assaulted beneath your own roof ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Jones replied with admirableurbanity , considering the nature of the question . " Make yourself entirely at home . " P222The Advantages of Nudity " SIR ! " CRIED YOLANDA . ARE YOU TRYING TO INSULT ME ? " " Far from it , " replied Mr. Jones , striving to bring his mind to grapple with the situation . " So many things are going on . Too many things . Are n't you the young woman who wanted to be assaulted ? " " Certainly not , " retorted Yolanda . " This is too much . I was nearly assaulted . "   " And someone interrupted you , " exclaimed Jones , as if suddenly seeing a light . " How extremely trying ! Who was the boorish party ? " " That man ! " cried Yolanda , pointing to an excited-lookinggentleman now being firmly held in check by two attendants . Mr. Jones looked quickly at the man , smiled ever so faintly , then elevated his eyes . " No , " he said . " You misunderstand . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you taken leave of your senses ? There was nothing to interrupt . " " But my dear young lady , " protested Mr. Jones rather wearily , " I thought you said nearly ' ? " " Listen , " explained Yolanda , her own voice taking on a note of weariness . " That naked creature  --  that chattering baboon  --  climbed through my window and attempted to attack me . I fled down here . That 's all there was to it . " " Not much , I 'll admit , " murmured Mr. Jones . " Scarcely anything at all . " He paused , then looked startled . " Is it possible , " he asked , " that you did not want to be assaulted ? " " Of course I did n't , " replied Yolanda , too frustrated to be offended . " Then why are you dressed ? " asked Jones , elevating his upturned palms . " Do n't you realize that the presence of clothes here is an open invitation to assault ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must first abandon her modesty ? " the girl inquired bitterly . " From your point of view , " replied Jones , " you have stated the case concisely . Even those extraordinary garments the Bishop has on would make him subject to assault were it not for his high calling . Of course , in the case of the Bishop the assaultress would have to be a woman of great determina-tion . " " I do n't understand it at all , " Yolanda uttered helplessly .   " Then let me explain , " said Jones , leading her to the divan where they seated themselves beside Peter . " Hello , Yolanda , " muttered that individual huskily . " Do n't speak to me , " snapped Yolanda , " you naked little nitwit . Should be ashamed of yourself . " " He 's not subject to assault like you , " retorted Jo , sitting down on a pillow at Peter 's feet and resting her red head against one of his shrinking legs . " I 'm not so sure of that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to add to your happiness , " Jo answered , " I 'm not so sure of it myself . " " Ladies , " Mr. Jones interrupted . " Please let me explain . " " Go on , Mr. Bones , " said Josephine . " That 's about all you are  --  Mr. Skin and Bones . " Jones looked at her for a moment with pensively elevated eyebrows , then cleared his throat as if to rid himself of some disturbing impression . " Mr. Jones , " asked Peter , " ca n't you do a little something about this arm ? It 's had a hard morning considering it 's been shot full of holes , or practically . " " Certainly , Mr. Van Dyck , " replied Mr. Jones in great concern . " Call Dr. Wolf , " he cried . " Wolfie ! Wolfie ! Wolfie ! " sang out a chorus of voices , and presently the naked physician , looking strangely out of place what with his professional air and incongruous little black bag , appeared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's arm . " Well , you see , " began Mr. Jones at length , " this little endeavor of ours , this small gathering of nudes , so to speak , is the result of too much reading , although the germ of the idea sprang from an age when books were not even printed . " " I can well understand that , " rumbled Bishop Waller . " The history of the world is littered with examples of theP225most reprehensible attempts to imitate the more shady side of the Garden of Eden . " " No doubt , " continued Jones smoothly . " All planets have had their pasts  --  their giddy moments in time . Yet , my dear Bishop , had it not been for such moments this world would not be populated today . " " Is it the aim of this small gathering of nudes , as you put it , to add to the world 's population ? " Peter enquired . " Not its chief aim , " replied Mr. Jones . " We would rather raise the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest yet . We have only been established a short time . " " For a short time you 've done pretty well , " interposed Little Arthur with a slight sniff . " There ai n't any more left to take off unless we skin ourselves alive . " " Jean Jacques Rousseau , Havelock Ellis , Craft Ebbing , and even that indefatigable humanitarian , Mr. H. G. Wells , not to mention innumerable other great thinkers , " resumed Mr. Jones , ignoring Little Arthur 's interruption , " have all at one time or another been preoccupied with the idea of nudity . " " If them guys you mentioned spent their time thinking about naked bodies , " Little Arthur declared , " they were n't great thinkers at all . Just plain nasty . " " It was not their desire , Little Arthur , " Jones explained patiently , " to think about nude bodies . Nude bodies meant nothing to them . They --  " " Yeah , " scoffed Little Arthur . " They must of been old hands at it  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are . Do n't even want to see nude bodies , much less think of ' em . " " Sex is entirely forgotten here , " said Mr. Jones with crushingsimplicity . " With all the reminders on every hand , " observed Josephine , " you must have exceptionally short memories . " " Sure , " agreed Little Arthur . " Ai n't we supposed ter use our eyes ? "
