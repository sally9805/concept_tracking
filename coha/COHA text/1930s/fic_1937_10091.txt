admiration for his father , who somehow walked kindly among them , kinder even than Libby , for Ruedy did n't have her snotty way with the others . Or horny , like some cows . Old Ruedy was n't horning anybody , not even his youngest son . That was a strange thing and worth thinking out sometimewhile he rode the fence line . The boy still went to the knoll where the dog was buried , usually late in the evening . It was n't being mushy . The human sign around would keep the coyotes and badgers from digging down to good old Wolf , he told himself , and he never stayed long , anyway , for the smell- of turpentine clung close to the memory . It reminded him of the Muhler horse he shot and made him feel so onery he had to kick his Prince pony in the belly and whip him until the poor faithful bay came to him quivering before he felt good again . And then sometimes he could n't hold back the tears and had to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short , stinging hair of the gentle animal and wished that he could die . Ruedy spent more and more time in Spring Branch Canyon with his flowers and his gardens . He was digging two deep ditches along the bluffs , one on each side , to carry off the surplus rain water and high enough for irrigating from the dam he had thrown across the branch . He built a wide , stone-edged pool beside the house and restored the smaller terraced ones that the cloudburst had washed out , replanting them all to fish , and bordering them with arrow-head lilies , water grasses , and brown-eyed Susans . But it was long , back-breaking work , not only digging the rocks , but moving , matching , and setting them just right for the pools and the cascades that led from one terrace to another . And at night he hunched his aching shoulders over his knees , smoked his pipe , scratched the neck of his little antelope , and put aside the things of Slogum House . Despite the hard times , the drouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Fourth , for the country was young , and hope died hard . The Slogums went over to the Beechner grove , a combined celebration , rodeo , and revival meeting . Because the Niobrara had fallen to a tepid current little more than ankle deep between yellow sandbars , the repentant were to be dipped in a large horse tank . It belonged to a lumberman from Dumur , who hoped , by helping to wash the sinners clean , to sell the new tank to some stockman who happened to see it and had a more regular need . Gulla stayed home because of Butch , but she sent a message by Annette to the walking sky pilot who conducted the revival , and so when the celebration was only trampled brown grass , dirty papers blowing in the rose brush , and piles of horse manure drying , Brother Smith caught a ride with a grinning , cussing freighter to Slogum House . The sky pilot turned out to be a lean , darkish man with careful curls on each side of his centre part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moustache when he spoke . He called Gulla " Sister Slogum " and ate heartily of Libby 's fried chicken , complaining a little , but gently , that the black tomcathad scratched when he tried to make friends with what he had assumed was one of God 's creatures . And after the singing that night he gave Annette a little Bible that he kissed fervently before her . And when she slipped away to Tad Green 's buggy and the sky pilot was left alone , he sneaked up to the bed of one of the secondstorygirls , who put him out because there was no advance money . The next morning Brother Smith was a sad , romantic figure at the Slogum table , head bowed over his inverted plate , the morning sun bright on his black curls for the freighters to see . Annette was up for breakfast to say good-bye . With the little Bible in her hand she watched the lone man plod away across Oxbow Flat to new fields.  | The next week Libby , with Dodie and Babbie to help , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currants for jelly . While the others picked into syrup buckets hung on strings around their waists , Libby whistled to her cat to follow and went up a draw where Mariposa lilies should be blooming . It was too late for them , but on the hip of the bluff the bull-tongue cactus were a mat of satin flowers , greenish yellow , large as the cup of her two palms , with bumblebees heavy and stupid with sweetness in their centres . But when Libby cut across the meadow to the gray clumps of buffalo berry that stood like smoke along the second bottom , - old Amos Ricker stopped her . His feet wrapped in rags and bailing wire , his old ten-bore shotgun across his arm , he came shuffling from the brush and raised the gun against the girl , shouting , " Git , git , you ! I ' 11 have no whores on my land ! " And so Libby gathered the others into the old buggy and hurried them away , forgetting the black torn hunting in the meadow grass somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , and filled their pails unmolested in sight of the neat little white house with bittersweet vines from window to window and the clump of golden glow beside the door . Libby looked at it a long time as she stripped the currants from the bending bushes into her pail , until Dodie scolded her . You g-g-got leaves , Miss Libby ! " And when they drove around by the Amos Ricker place to pick up the cat they found the naked carcass nailed to the top of the gatepost , fresh and bloody . That evening a hailstorm swept down from Dumur way and through the Willow into the sandhills , missing Ruedy 's place entirely but leaving the slopes to the east white as with snow . The next Sunday , Os Puddley , son of the Judge , allowed little spending money but trying desperately to makep103usefulness a substitute in the affections of Cellie , brought news to Slogum House . A bunch of berry pickers had found Tex Bullard , buried face down , in the lane where his horses used to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June and the recent hail had cut deep into the bare lane , exposing the heel of one shoe and a smell of something long dead . The sheriff and the coroner had just gone down ; an inquest was called . Gulla listened to Cellie 's sobbing account , questioned Os herself , and went upstairs . A few minutes later Hab and Cash , riding together for the first time in weeks , cut across Oxbow towards Bullard 's place to offer their help . Leo Platt identified both the clothing and the man , the bloated face still recognizable , the light hair coming up in little curls as the wind dried it . The dead man wore the jacket with the pocket torn down . It had happened that last evening Platt saw Tex alive . They had gone to the pump together for water for the supper coffee and the pump handle caught in the pocket . Platt had teased him a little . He needed a wife good with a needle . The men stood around as Tad Green dashed a hatful of water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulging eyes , the gray-purple of the swollen lips . Yes , it was Bullard all right , with his skull crushed by a heavy blow on the temple and a lighter one as from some blunt instrumenton the side , far back , perhaps from striking his head as he fell . They went over the shack , the yard , the grave , but found nothing more . Even the pasture was bare , the young horses all gone  --  stolen , everybody knew . On a knoll one crippled old gray mare ate alone . Because , as Hab pointed out , Leo Platt was evidently the last person to see Bullard alive , the sheriff started away to the county jail with him , Rene Dumur asking that he be allowed to ride along beside Green 's buggy . At a sign from Hab ,  |p104the  sheriff roared against the youth , but he insisted , protestingthat he was unarmed and had as much right in the main traveled road as anybody . " Hell , yes , " someone shouted from the crowd , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get ' em ! " And although the man did n't make himself known , several settlers rode out boldly with Rene . In the meantime the coroner , with the new pine box far back in his wagon , drove away toward the little cemetery overlooking the junction of the Willow and the Niobrara , a lengthening string of buggies and horsebackers following . But long after the officers and the Slogums were gone a little knot of settlers hung around the Bullard homestead , talking low and serious among themselves . Finally they scattered to their Sunday evening chores , and there were only the open hole , the trodden lane , and the smell that hung over the deserted soddy Tex Bullard had built up the bank from the clear , clean water of Willow Creek . Hab and Cash came riding home through the evening sun of Oxbow Flat , whistling a little , tunelessly and unaccustomed , but loud . Libby , crossing the yard with a pail of new eggs , heard them and knew that somewhere in Slogum House Gulla would be listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After ten minutes together in Gulla 's room , the mother and her two sons came out to supper , talking as friendly as though there was no Butch Haber upstairs , holding his palm to the hole of an ear to catch every sound . " Well , that gets him out a the way until court sets  --  " Hab was saying as they settled themselves . Ruedy , just over from Spring Branch , looked up from his end of the table . " Who ? " he finally asked . " Your good friend Platt  --  held for the murder of Libby 's old beau  --  " Hab answered , his moustache jerking a littlep105over his two teeth at the sudden flooding to Cellie 's eyes . But to-night even the eldest daughter kept her silence before the triumphant Gulla and her sons . And when Libby finally escaped the Slogum table , she found Babbie crying into her food in the kitchen because the new second-floor girl swung her supple hips at Montana of the Diamond B , now that the little kitchenmaid was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one kind or another for them all , from Gulla to little Babbie . Angrily Libby slammed around the kitchen , hurrying up the work , and when Dodie got in her way with the swill pail she threw the wet dishrag in her hand hard in the hunchback 's unoffending face . But before the screen door was done with its humming she was out after him . " Dodie , Dodie , " she called softly so none of the others could hear . " Oh  --  I ' m so sorry  --  I ' m mean as a shedding rattler  --  A little blot of darker shadow separated itself from the side of the porch . A moment Dodie stood there and seemed to be rubbing an arm over his face . Finally he got his awkwardtongue to make a few apparently irrelevant words . " M-maybe the rain she c-c-come , Miss Libby , " he said , and slipped away towards the dark huddle of sheds and corrals . Libby watched the stooped little figure fade into the night , her arms leaden . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Hab and Butch ,  --  driven by something that made them fall upon the helpless to hurt them , to tear them , even poor little Dodie , with such strange goodness in his heart . There was no singing around Libby at the organ that night . The girl sat silent at her dark window , with no word for Gulla when she came inquiring , only a silence that sent the mother away again . A long time afterward soft little steps crept up the stairs , not Butch or Cash sneaking around , but Cellie , pushing in Libby 's door , whispering , her voice hoarse with long crying : " He did n't do it  --  did n't kill Tex , did he , on account of you ? " Libby came to her , staring out upon the sister in the dim fight as upon a stranger . Gradually she brought some coherenceto the girl 's words . " Leo Platt ?  --  Of course he did n't kill Tex over me , " she comforted . " He did n't do it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Cash ' s been saying , and Butch too , and now Hab  --  " the girl wondered , her soft little hands uncertain and miserable . " Butch is a liar and a rascal and the boys are fools , " Libby told the sister as she took her down the stairs and put her into her rose and blue bed . Now that the horse-stealing case against the Slogums was finished for want of evidence , and the locator , Platt , was out of the way for the murder of the leading witness , Hab rattled his spurs with even more arrogant step through Slogum House . But still Butch remained ; and still Gulla said " Wait , " or gave her eldest son no answer at all . And so the infuriated Hab turned increasingly upon Ruedy and Libby and Ward . In the sister he found no more satisfaction than in a stone between the teeth . " You ' re nothing but a dirty , skulking coyote , " she told him to his face , " trying to make a noise big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Branch Canyon , but for the boy Ward , with the memory of his dog , and of the horse he shot still fresh upon him , there was no escape . He got scrawnier and jumpier every day , with the need for dodging out the back door of the sheds or the grainery always upon him . Even so , Hab caught him at last , saw him using an old bridle the brother had thrown away long before , using it to catch up the playful Prince when the pony broke his patchedp107old reins . Before Ward could get to the shed , Hab was upon him . Yanking the bridle from the animal , he cut the boy across the head with it , the bit hitting him in the face , knockinga tooth into the dry manure of the corral . Stumbling back , Ward clapped his hand to his bleeding mouth , his eyes flooding with pain and fright and helpless anger as the pony galloped away to the far fence , kicking up his heels . Haber Slogum wiped his moustache down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridle to the boy 's feet . " Take it , you damn , sniffling bastard , " he said , and stalked away , his high boot heels sinking into the dry manure of the barnyard . Leading out his horse , he rode off towards the summer range beyond the hogback . When Hab was safely gone Ward sneaked out to the tank and , using the smooth face of the water as a mirror , he washed all the blood away . Then he slipped quietly upstairs to stuff a shirt and some socks into a gunny sack . In Hab 's room he drove a plug of wood deep into the barrel of his thirtythirtyrifle . Then he went down to his chores . While filling the cow-chip box behind the range he talked to Libby . " And so you ' re really going ? " she asked as she moulded hot buns for supper . The boy ran his tongue into the hole that still tasted blood and salt and nodded , no longer frightened or sorry , even a little glad that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars she had saved and her buckskin horse and gripped his hand a moment , like brother to brother . " Yeh , high-tailing it for good , " the boy said , trying to make it sound easy . But it was n't , not a bit , and suddenly , his face very red , he kissed his sister and , turning , ran out through the kitchen door . From the window Libby watched him go , the pinch of dough she held forgotten in the marvel that there was one among the Slogums who could get away . Cautiously the boy pretended that everything was as always.  | With his rifle in his hand and a lump of rock salt in a sack , he rode out as though he were only headed for the Spring Slough pasture . That evening the Slogum plates waited , face down , for two empty chairs to fill . At last Hab stalked in , his wind-browned cheeks fresh shaved , a new orange neckerchief at his throat . Still Gulla waited in silent disapproval for Ward to come sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all where the boy was , and received no reply except that Cash raised his attention from the checked tablecloth before him a moment and then lowered it again , without speaking . " Out sulking some place  --  " he volunteered at last . " Who sent him to sulk ? " the mother demanded . " Hell , I did n't say nobody sent him , " the son answered , leaning forward to look without friendliness toward Hab around the mother , meaning for her to see . " Well ? " Gulla demanded . So Cash teetered back in his chair a little , tasting this momentfully . " Oh  --  nothing , " he said ; " Hab , he just had to straighten the Kid out a little  --  " " You snitching son of a bitch  --  " Gulla turned upon the eldest . " Watch your mouth , you  --  " " Yah , " the second son grinned in his unusual triumph . " Knocked a tooth out  --  " bringing it from his pocket and wiping the chaff away on his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up . A long time her little black eyes moved from one son to the other , until they hitched their chairs closer to the table and stooped over their inverted plates to take her anger upon their backs . " You ' 11 act like gentlemen , with respect for each other , you Slogum scum ! " she told them , taking in the whole table , the disturbed father with the rest . Then , noticing that all the freighters beyond the archway were craning out of their knotted bandanas to see , the woman spread her lean mouth asp109at a good joke and sat down . But in a lowered voice she finished : " I ' 11 put the lot of you where you belong if you ai n't careful , and do n't you forget it . Cash , do n't you let me catch you tilting your chair back at the table again , or fetching in dirty things like teeth at mealtime ! " They fell to eating , but several times during the supper a quiver of satisfaction touched the moustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the meal was done he dared to push his chair back , leaving Cash trapped . Apologetically Ruedy rose to let Cash get away too , and shuffled out for the milk pail to help Dodie . Alone with Gulla , the twins excused themselves and flounced their ruffled skirts away . Libby brought in the dessert and saw that the mother was alone . " Ward ' s gone , " the girl said , much as though it were the last of the biscuits she was announcing , or the cob bucket empty . " You ' 11 be paid out for this , all of you , " the mother told her calmly , wiping up the last pool of brown gravy from the big meat platter with a crust , now that the freighters had all disappeared . Alone , and in satisfaction , she ate her dessert , letting the smooth creaminess of the butterscotch pudding roll over her tongue , crunching the nut meats meditatively . It was a good mess , and soothing , this pudding she had taught Libby to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much that could be done in Slogum House , for even with Butch among them Cash was still a Slogum , caving in like a sandbankunder her foot . As for the young squirt , Ward , he would come running back , tail between his legs , soon enough . Late that night Libby walked through the pale , cool moonlightof the hogback , the dark clump of soapweeds squatting away from her , suddenly alien , unfriendly . The little house in the rustling cottonwoods of Spring Branch Canyon was dark and still . A long time she hesitated , but finally she went up and stood on the doorstep , diffident as a little girl . Even now the unaccustomed word " father " would not come to her tongue and so she called " Ruedy , " once softly , and then louder , " Ruedy , Ruedy ! " There was a stir inside and a sound of suspenders trailing on the floor . " It ' s me , " she said , as the screen door opened . " Ah , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What then is wrong ? " " Nothing  --  only I could n't go away without saying goodbye to you . " He peered at her in the pale wash of light a long time . Finally he sat down on the doorstep . " Ja , you will go . Long I saw it coming , and now there is nothing more to hold you . " He spoke sadly , and happily too . " It must be good , out in the world  --  " Then he straightened up . " But she will not let you go  --  " " She ca n't hold me , " the daughter answered hotly . " Ja , now is it enough , " the father admitted , dropping into the idiom of his childhood . " Sit you here a minute . Sit you here before it is good-bye  --  " So , for the first time , Libby sat beside her father on his own doorstep , the canyon a pale cavern about them , the frogs in the cattails summer-hoarse , the squabble of the mallards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch faint on the night wind . Now and then the soft sheen of the moon on the pools was broken by the slow nose of a muskrat , the trail behind him spreading to lap softly against the rock edges . At last the girl got up and started away . But she could n't go so , and , turning , she found herself crying in her father 's arms . " Liebchen , Liebcben , " he said over and over . " Ach , what have I then done to my children ? "  |p111The  next morning Libby asked Dodle to harness a team . He was to take her to Dumur after breakfast . He grinned . This was his first time to take her to town , all the long way in the buggy , with the wheels singing . He galloped away . At the screen door 's slamming Gulla came out of her room . " The calendar says windy to-day , " she called from the hall . " It ai n't a good day for you to go to town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , holding her dressing sacque together over her petticoat and not pretendingany longer . " You wo n't find him there  --  he ' 11 be gone . Or is it that full-pants from down on the river you ' re running after ? " Libby whipped the pancake batter another minute , dropped a blob on the hot griddle , and watched the blisters rise in it . " I do n't run after anybody . I ' m going away myself , for good . " Gulla stepped back from the announcement , into the protection of the gloomy hall . " So , " she said , patting her heavy , folded arms as she always did when annoyed . " So , you was going to leave your good home and your old mother without a word  --  " Libby poured a little more bacon grease from the skillet into the batter , beat the golden islands out of sight , and filled the griddles . After the dishes were put away , the bread mixed and set on the warming oven to rise , Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chute , and went to her room . When she came down in her green shirtwaist dress and her veiled yellow sailor , she was already something remote from Slogum House . She stuffed the black signal cloth she used to carry far back into the range and watched it jerk a little as it slowly turned red and sent a stench out over the yard . When the cloth was only a crumpling of dark ashes , she let her old green chiffon veil flow through her fingers , watching the flame run up its folds . When it was gone too , she picked up her satchel and , without once looking back , she got into the buggy . Gulla was in the driver 's place . She slacked the lines , and the disappointed Dodie was left behind . They drove the three miles to the lower Oxbow crossing in silence , Libby 's face calm as a sand dune on a still day , and as aloof from her mother 's growing anger . At the top of the bluff on the far side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed the whip back to Slogum House , only a low dark spot against the far hogback standing bluish against the lighter sky . " There , " she said , " is what I got to show for twenty-five years of slavin ' . You think you got the right to quit me now I ' m getting together a nice start for you all ? " Libby faced her mother in astonishment , a tightening of anger under her high starched collar . " A start for us  --  and how did you get it ? " she demanded . " Do you think I do n't know there must be people in the world who manage to eat without lying , cheating , stealing , even murder and the prostitution of their daughters ? " A moment the woman 's face flushed purplish under its dark down . Then she calmed herself , even though the knuckles over the leather lines whitened . " You forget I got to do it the only way you Slogums is fit for  --  and no help from anybody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels whirred in the hard ruts , and dust spread out long behind them in the rising wind . At the depot Gulla tried to give her daughter the beaded bag that Annette and Cellie so often used , but the girl shook her head and , drawing her skirts about her , stepped into the train that was leaving Dumur , west-bound . The mother watched her from the cinder platform . When the smoke and steam were gone she went down the street top113the office of the Dumur Duster and gave the frowsy , seedymoustachedold newspaper man an item . She had it written out on tablet paper , ready :  --  Mrs. Ruedy Slogum drove up from Slogum Ranch , south of the river , for some shopping and to spend the day . Her daughter , Miss Libby , took the noon train for Hot Springs for a short visit with friends . The man pushed his glasses up on his forehead , looked after Gulla Slogum , and back to the item . Then he called someone in the back and hobbled out toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already far down the street . Because Babbiewould probably let the bread sour , she bought six loaves at the baker 's and started homeward . Now and then she remembered that there was supper to get for from ten to a dozen hungry men , and she touched the flanks of the tired horses with the gay red whip that belonged to Annette , given her by someone , Gulla could not recall just who now . But most of the time the woman leaned wearily over her thick knees and let the dust settle on her hat and her best black silk undisturbed . Once she unbuttoned the front of her basque , stuffed her handkerchief into her bosom where her corset jabbed her , and slowly buttoned up again , her thick fingers clumsy . She thought about her fine plans . There was no hurry about finishing up the inside of the west end of the second floor now . Two whole empty rooms , and the Slogum table getting shorter , too . Perhaps it was only for a little while . She straightened up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses . The wheels spun again and the dust rose.  |p114THE  week Libby left Oxbow Flat , a dry , desolate wind blew over all the upper Niobrara region . It curled the little plots of scattered corn that had found moisture to sprout at all , burned the gray twisted leaves until they rattled like Novemberfodder . At Slogum House it lifted the soft , hoof-worn dust of the yard , laying bare the packed earth with its bits of glass , old buttons , and the thick scattering of rusty nails dropped by Slogum lumber . It rolled an empty syrup bucket from porch to grainery and back again , swung the dipper at the windmill from its nail , upset the smokehouse , rattled the crow 's nest , and blew the tops off the haystacks behind the sheds . It snapped the corners off the sheets and frayed the fringed bedspreads left on the line far too long . But at last Gulla waddled out like an overfed duck in her high corset , calling even Annette and Cellie from their sleeping to help gather up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed patches of the yard . Gradually the meals settled into something like regularity , but the old customers still grumbled . " Them flapjacks ' d make good tug leather , but the biscuits ai n't worth a goddamn for nothin ' but cannon stuffin ' against the Indians , " grumbled old Joe Hook , who claimed he ' d driven an ammunition wagon for the army all over hell and gone and never caught up with the damned Sioux . " I ' 11 have no such vulgar talk at my table , Mr. Hook , " Gulla said coldly , imagining herself one of the real ladies pictured in The Welcome Guest . At her words Joe Hookp115stopped the- double work of his knife and fork , resting them on their wooden handles , a piece of ham on the tines and his wide mouth hanging open to receive it . Hank Short set his saucer down and tapped his coffee-soaked moustache daintily with the corner of the bandana about his neck . " Hobble that air vile tongue of yourn , Mister Hook . There ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roar of laughing that went around the table Gulla fled to the duskiness of her room . A long time she stood before her map of Dumur County , with its projected Slogum range outlined in red . All this planning and slaving , and what did she get for it ? Trouble and insults from the whole lot . Neglect from Ruedy ; threats from Butch while he laid around putting on leaf lard with her good grub ; desertion from that frozen-faced Libby and the young squirt , Ward . And now the horse laugh from a dirty bunch of lank-gutted whore chasers lolling around her table . Under the roweling of her grievances , Gulla 's thick neck swelled , and she reached out a pudgy hand to rip the map from the wall . But an angry thumping from the sewing room above sent her scurrying to bring Butch his breakfast , to carry a tray like a kitchenmaid , she , Gulla Slogum , in-law of these fine Slogums of Ohio , and with no help at all but that rabbit-faced Babbie , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot without spilling everything . When Butch was fed , Gulla returned to her desk , pushing herself to plan  --  not the expansion of her possessions but the three meals of every day , the baking and churning , the simplest cleaning . Only yesterday old Bill Billings told her , right to her face , that the place was getting to be just like any other damned dirty hog ranch , with the bunks full o ' pants rabbits . Gulla had puffed up the stairs to see , scolding the trailing Babbie with every step . In all the years Libby never let bugs of any kind get started . She could see a graybacka mile off . Now they ' d have to strip the beds , change the straw in all the bunk ticks , boil or steam everything that could stand heat , and carry the rest out to the anthills on the knoll , like the Indians did with their buffalo robes . And every day she ' d have to go through the bunks herself , stooping into the lower ones , climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she must have Libby back , and Ward too , a daily reminder that even a fifteen-year-old could kick the dust of his heels in his mother 's face . Nor had Ruedy been over to a meal since the girl left . He sent the vegetables , fresh and clean as before , even the cherries from his young trees , his special pride , but always by Dodie . Yes , it was time she corralled the Slogums once more . Locking her desk , Gulla ordered the buggy brought to the door and drove through the morning sun towards Spring Branch . She had never seen Ruedy 's place since he filed on it , six years ago , throwing his land right away , she called it then ; yet he had somehow managed to grow a lot of garden truck in that worthless hole . At the first dip in the road into the canyon Gulla slowed the horses and looked down upon Ruedy 's place . Once it had been a wild little gulch between sandstone bluffs , with loose gravel and rock sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush , and poison ivy . Now the ragged tangles of the slopes were subdued and confined . Out of the soft mass of green along each bluff rose slim young ash and box elders , and cottonwoods . Below them ran a deep ditch with irrigation laterals leading down between rows of young apple , plum , and cherry trees , and through beds of hollyhocks and zinnia and marigold in bright bloom . Where the bogs had been lay the gardens of vegetablesfor Slogum House and the market at Dumur , the rich earth soaked black by the spreading laterals that fed backp117into Spring Branch as the stream cascaded from terrace to terrace through the centre of the canyon and finally wound away in a grass-grown channel towards Cedar Creek , two miles down . Near the head of the canyon , where the eagles circled their nest , tall cottonwoods rustled over a little house of sod . And from the shade beside the quiet , spring-fed pool a young antelope trotted curiously into the road to look . But instead of coming to meet Gulla , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch , the little animal stood aloof , shy and afraid , its head high . Suddenly it wheeled and , leaping the cascades , was away , up the bluff towards the south hills . With her team tied to a cottonwood Gulla pulled the leather latchstring of Ruedy 's home and for the first time realized that there must be much in her husband 's life that did not get within reach of her fingers . The room was pleasant , comfortable , the walls the soft gray of native plaster , a bright red and black Indian blanket on the old couch bed . On the floor were several small rugs and the skin of a large gray wolf almost white , one that she suspected Leo Platt shot , for Ruedy would n't be up to it . At the windows hung curtains bright as ripe tomatoes , and a fine pedestaled globe stood beside an easy-chair and a shaded reading lamp . She knew that these were not Dumur purchases but things that came from the city , things that cost money she should be getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruedy rode west from Ohio had increased into a good double wagon-box load , neatly arranged along the walls . And over the stone fireplace at the far end of the room was a large crayon portrait of a woman , her hair parted in the middle , the braid-crowned face strong , with wide-set , direct eyes and a stubborn chin , the face of the Grossmutter . Leaving a note commanding Ruedy to Slogum House immediately , Gulla slammed the door upon these things that were no part of her . Standing up in the buggy , she lashed the horses into a run with the ends of the lines , the fine red whip rattling idly in the socket , the wheels throwing fans of gravel from the trail at the curves . By the time Gulla reached Slogum yard she had calmed enough to send Dodie over with the old cart for the vegetables that Ruedy had left ready in sacks and pails in the shade beside his stone bench . With Babbie cleaning the cellar shelves , out of her way , Gulla baked gooseberry pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal she ran the curling iron through her graying hair and tied a white lawn apron around her , with the wide bow riding her broad hips . But Dodie drove up the trail alone . Nor did Ruedy come for supper or all the next day , until Gulla wished she had broken the picture of the grandmotherwhen she had it down , broken it across her thick knee as she would a stick of diamond willow . But by this time Butch had walked boldly to Annette 's room and put his shoulder against it until the iron bar creaked . He had his skinning knife out , was ready to dig at the soft wood when Gulla came into the hall . Before her cold eyes the brother retreated , snapping the blade down into the stag handle , and climbed the stairs , but slowly , looking back upon his sister under his heavy toad lids . And when he was gone it took Gulla half an hour to get Annette quieted so she could meet Tad Green smiling . They could n't hold Leo Platt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff , the county attorney , and the district judge working for the Slogums . At the trial the very thin net of circumstantial evidence broke before the surprise testimonyof young Rene Dumur . Running his long , lean fingers through his mat of sun-bleached curls as though he did n't know that the soft-eyed Annette was there on the front row , between the Slogum sons , he told what he knew of the last time anybody seemed to have seen Tex Bullard alive.  |p119On  the night of the little May rain , he was cutting across the Bullard pasture by the light of the storm , and he saw Tex in his open doorway , shouting a " So long ! " to Leo Platt . He knew that it was Platt because he let his horse out and caught up with the locator to ask about using his hand planter the next day for a little patch of sweet corn . They rode down to Platt 's claim together , where two homeseekerswere waiting . It took to raining harder before he got away and so he stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free land Platt and Bullard would show the newcomers to-morrow up Cedar Creek , with some pretty good meadow land , and yet not likely to bring trouble with the cattlemen if they knew who located the homeseekers . At this there were angry boot scrapings among the settlers , spur rattling and a roar of laughing from the cowmen , particularly Clancy Haw , foreman of the Diamond B , and Lew Jackson , of the Lazy J , with Hab Slogum on the front row smoothing his moustache in satisfaction . The judge pounded down the noise , and Rene was ordered to look to his tongue or he ' d find himself in trouble . No , he could n't say when the locator next went to the Bullard place , or who else might have gone there , or why . But there was plenty talk . . . At this Hab threw the attorney a sidling glance and Rene was not allowed to go on , nor was he asked where he had been that May night . The two homeseekers who went with Platt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them were not called . And so the locator walked out of the courthouse a free man , and no one asked who might gain from the death of Bullard or seemed to recall that he was the key witness in the horse-stealing case against Hab and Cash Slogum . That is , no one spoke of these things before the long , gaunt sons of Slogum House , their holsters heavy on their thighs . In Hot Springs , Libby was working for a dressmaker ,  | designing and fitting late summer garments for the resort 's ladies of fashion . The pay was poor but the compliments were plentiful . Then , too , the job was less public than her first one , clerking in a curio store on the one street of the town , where those who had fed and bedded at Slogum House were continually passing , pointing her out , reminding her of everything on Oxbow : the second-floor girls , Annette and Cellie , the struggle between Gulla and Butch , with the rest taking sides , and of Ruedy , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things as they were beyond the hogback . One morning the woman of the curio shop hurried to the door ahead of her , holding it at a crack against her from the inside . " You keep away from here , you Miss Libby Slogum ! " she called out for all the passing street to hear , the veins of her buzzard neck throbbing under the black net of her boned collar . " You belong to Silver Nell 's , down by the depot  --  not with decent women . " Libby looked at the woman , at her mouth clamped in the rusting iron of spinsterhood , and laughed her first good laugh since Ward rode away from Slogum House ; even longer  --  since she struck poor Dodie with the wet dishrag . The next day the girl was working at the dressmaker 's house with a back stoop and a bit of grass between it and the swift roaring of Fall River among red stones , and the thick matting of watercress . After that Libby was almost never seen on the single street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the town , to watch the retreating sun slip up the piny slopes and the red buttes jutting out over Fall River Canyon , the cool shadows creeping like dark mist from the gulches upon the town . With her pointed chin in her palm Libby thought about Spring Branch Canyon and Ruedy , and about Ward , safe inp121his courage , wrangling for a little cow outfit near Cheyenne , five dollars a month and found . He would grow up tall and strong , stronger than Ruedy , but with his father 's kindness  --  an upright , honest man . And always in the evenings Libby watched for the slim young girl in black riding sidesaddle on a high-headed , creamtailedsorrel , up around Battle Mountain , a handsome blond youth following on a gray . Once from the dressmaker 's window Libby saw them coming back through the twilight , still holding their horses in , their young faces shining , their eyes shy as children 's . It must be fine to grow up so , to see goodness , sweetness , in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and their recurrent bed shakings , fee payable in advance . And sometimes Libby thought of Leo Platt , so fine and tall on his blue roan , and now sitting in the jailhouse at Dumur . Someone sent a copy of the Dumur Duster with the notice of the locator 's release to Libby at Hot Springs . She sat a long time with the paper spread open on her knee . Yes , of course it would be so . Not even the Slogums could hold him . She reread the testimony of Rene Dumur  --  why need it have been his ? Everything was against those two , against Annette and her curly-haired French boy from the Niobrara . The next evening Leo Platt was waiting for Libby at the back stoop . He was leaning against the gate , a casual smile of his white teeth for everyone to see as Libby came out . But as they matched their long strides it was not as the first time walking together , but only once more of an always , as the cloud moves easily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaving the window watchers behind them , the two crossed the footbridge and went up the shadowing , needle-cushioned path to the top of the butte . They sat on Libby 's flat , red rock , the sun at their backs , and looked down upon the little town and beyond to Battle Mountain , where two great Indian nations had fought to the death for these Black Hills . Here was the dwelling place of their Great Spirit , to which the young men came for their fasting and their visions , the place where there was always game , water and wood , and shelter from enemy and winter winds . But long ago the victorious Sioux were driven out too by the gold-hungry white man with his wagon guns . Mostly the two talked of casual things , not of Slogum House or the trial or anything of importance to them both . How had he found her ? Everybody in town knew her and where she was . Too many had eaten of her plum jam and biscuits at Slogum House . Libby tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the biscuits at all , but something else , something that could never be spoken between them . They talked of the summer here , away from the heat and the dust , of the wind in the pines , the wisps of steam rising from the warm waters of Fall River on cold mornings , and of the swift showers that swept the canyons like brush brooms and then moved out upon the hot plains and dried to pale streaks on the horizon . It was beautiful . And yet the Niobrara was beautiful too , winding silverbluebetween its tall bluffs ; the clear , hurrying stream and the spreading old cottonwoods in the meadows , like great men standing alone . Leo locked his strong , browning hands around his knee and looked away to the opposite canyon wall , stained almost a blood red in the evening sun above the pine slopes , with a row of dark trees standing like Indian horsemen along the crests of the bluffs . He talked of his coming to the Niobrara country , for strangely this was the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard under the watchfulness of Gulla . He told of his youth down near O'Neill , where the vigilantesp123rode hard upon the heels of the horse thieves only a few years before . His father had been in the viges , and Leo too , althoughstill a stripling , because there were only the two of them . Then he saw his father shot down and discovered that once more , as so often happened , the leaders of the vigilantes and the horse thieves were the same men . And so six years ago , when he was old enough to file on land , he came away from it , hoping for peace and quiet and a little place of his own with no need to watch his stable door . At these thoughtless words the man who neighbored with the Slogums stopped , his neck red as a turkey 's with remembering . And even when his color cooled , all the ease of his manner was gone and Libby could see that it would always be so between them , like walking with a cactus barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of them , might learn to toe out , so the sharp point of the cactus would scarcely be noticed , yet it would be there , waiting for an unwarymovement . And gradually they would lose their free , easy gait that they both should carry all through life . But while the girl crushed the handkerchief in her belt with her strong fingers and kept her eyes to the far bluffs , the man saw only that her face was quiet as the evening sky , that the veins under her loose , elbow sleeves were slender blue branches of a winter tree on the inside of her arm , strong as galvanized wire over the back of her hand . Once more he saw the dusky stillness of her hair , so close and sweet , and took courage to speak again . " I like the Niobrara , the old Running Water of the early settlers , " he said , quite easily , but guarding his tongue well . " The river country is my home , yet I ' d sell out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d say the word  --  " A little wind rose behind them in the higher hills somewhere , swept through the tall pines and into the long silence between this daughter of the Slogums and their locator enemy.  | It swept between them and away to the town that was coming out of the shadow in early window lights along the curve of the bluff and the river at its feet . At last Libby had to turn to the man , to see again the strong , black , uprushing hair over the brow that was still pink from the hatband , the cleft in the jail-whitened chin that would soon be a wholesome brown again . Finally she had to face his eyes too , and saw now that they were the firm dark gray of sound steel . And before their straightforwardnessa flushing came over her and she had to look away . " No  --  no , " she answered him slowly , her words like worn pebbles dropping into a long-still pool . " It ' s enough  --  the things the Slogums have done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them between us all the time , twisting our words like rain twists a good lariat  --  " The next evening Leo was at the stoop again , and the next . On Sunday he hired a rig at the livery stable , with a gay fringed orange laprobe that would show the dust of the red road scarcely at all . Together they drove out into the rising mist of the morning towards Wind Cave ; they chased chipmunksover the rocks as they ate their lunch at noon ; picked wild strawberries on grassy slopes and drank at a spring where harebells bloomed . They stood together to look up at the gray granite peaks against the light sky , saw a mother fox with her four red , pointed-faced young , and watched deer feeding with their fawn in the evening meadows . And only a few times the whole day was it necessary for Leo to explain a silence away or Libby to laugh very gayly . Rene Dumur , with skin a tawny brown , and sun-bleached head curly as a buffalo 's , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be Dumur County . The father , a schoolmaster , came West in 1878 for his lungs . He grew strong and broad as the Sioux with whom he hunted , and hep125died in a train wreck on his first trip to Chicago to see his wife and son . So Ophelie Dumur and her son Rene were left with a county and the county seat named for them , a few unimproved lots in the town , and a half section of land , mostly bluffs and timber , along the Niobrara . Fortunately there was money enough to get there . So they moved to the West that had given health to their Ernest , despite the protests of Ophelie 's sister that they must remain with her . And here Rene , the slim city boy , learned that blisters can turn to protecting calluses , and that a walkingplough may buck as hard as a Wyoming outlaw . But in the evenings , so long as his fingers were not too work-cramped , he played his violin , and even when his face was streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his hat in his hand when talking to a woman . The first time Rene saw Annette Slogum was four years ago , after a fall flood in the Niobrara , when the November trees along the bluffs were still tipped with a few persistent orange leaves , like dying flames hovering over gray smoke . The girl was on a fine , deep-chested sorrel and , instead of the usual dusty black riding habit and sidesaddle , she rode astride in one of Hab 's old brown corduroy suits with brown hair chaps , and on her flying auburn hair sat a little tam-o ' - shanter as golden orange as the leaves . Annette was pointing a herd of longhorn cattle into the river , her horse smelling out solid footing through the fall quicksand , coyly putting out a forefoot , backing , snorting , and then splashing forward securely . Finally she was across , the cattle crowding close behind her , with the two black-hatted , rope-snapping Slogum brothers at their tails . To Rene in torn overalls mud-caked from setting muskrat traps along the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snow-bound cedar once , the dark crest and the bits of red wax on the wings almost unbearably beautiful.  | The boy leaned on his twenty-two rifle in the willows until there was only the dust hanging over the trees to show that a herd of longhorns was headed towards Dumur , the town that was named for his father . A herd of longhorns and a girl with an orange cap . Four years later it was still so with him , only now there were all the long dreams of youth and the knowledge that while Annette had laughed at him many times , sometimes she slipped away from Slogum House and sat against the night sky beside him . Once she had laid her small fingers gently on his arm and exclaimed in pride that it was like a young ash , so smooth and straight and strong . Because he saw Annette ride into the yard at the Bartek post office a few times with Cellie , he haunted the place until his mother turned her sharp Frenchwoman tongue upon him . " So our fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run-run to the Barteks . Is it then the dumb Agnes , her lip hanging down like the dirty apron ? " So she did truly look , the poor Agnes Bartek with her halfwitmouth , and they laughed together very heartily at the mother 's clever characterization as they ate pot roast of grouse with bay leaves . It was because of this light-hearted laughing that Ophelie Dumur felt she could leave her son when her sister , suddenly widowed , sent for her to come to Chicago . " Why must you then live in that wild country , with the savages , when I have the pleasant home for you ? " So the mother went , kissing her son soundly on each cheek and telling him nothing about being a good boy , but reminding him never to forget to laugh . Ah , laughter , that was the tonic of the soul . And when life became weary here , alone , there is always Chicago , no ? But Rene never went . He stayed , learning the art of batching from Leo Platt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boar 's nests , as did so many lone men . Graduallyp127he learned , too , about Slogum House and its several businesses , but somehow nothing of it made any difference until he saw Annette in the yellow-wheeled buggy of the sheriff , the stupid Tad Green , with a quiet , honest wife in Dumur and a stomach like a barrel under his vest . That night the boy walked the darkness away , nor did he go near the hogback for a week . But when he finally climbed its slopes again , his feet heavy as with river mud , Annette was there waiting , and she held him against her and stroked the curls of his head . And as the spring passed Rene made plans to take her away in the night because even he could see that the Slogums would not want to let her go . In his mind it was Flab and Cash who were to blame . He would not see Gulla in it , for to him all women were as his own generous , large-bosomed , freespokenmother , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse-stealing case that needed the influenceof the sheriff for the Slogums , and now this thing about Bullard and Leo Platt and a strange new fear that seemed somehowalways with Annette the last two months , hanging like a black bank of cloud on the horizon even when she came to the hogback through the starlight . After the trial of Leo Platt Annette got away from Tad Green as soon as she could . Despite the thundercloud gatheringoverhead when she reached the lower Oxbow crossing , she drew her livery team from the main road and followed the two ruts winding through the trees toward the Dumur place . She drove carefully , keeping in the protection of the timber as much as she could , her veil thrown back over her hat , her eyes searching the bluffs . And every cow 's lazy stomping at the flies in the river was the splash of a horsebackercrossing the stream to the girl ; every sapling that swayed in the wind , every bush that stirred with a cottontail'srunning , was a snooper from Slogum House . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a wide old cottonwood standing alone in the centre ,  | a tall man was rapidly loading a hayrack before the sprinkling of rain already starting . And now the girl could no longer be careful . Touching her horses , she sent the buggy rocking over the rough ground and the fragrant windrows of hay . At the sound of the wheels Rene looked up , and without even stopping to plunge his fork safely into the ground he came running . In the centre of the open meadow , where anyone on the rim of the bluffs of the slopes on either side of the river could see , he lifted her from the buggy and held her long against his dusty , rain-speckled shoulder . " So many nights I waited on the hill and you did not come  --  " Rene whispered , as though there had been no horsestealingcase and no Tad Green at all . Even yesterday 's trial of Leo Platt seemed never to have been , with no need for him to stand between the Slogums and their removal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his tongue and the smell of sun in his hair , and the bluffs stood against the sky in a firm ring all around . A piece of bright rainbow hung against a dissolving cloud in the east as Annette drove into the Slogum yard . Gulla motioned Dodie to take the team and , putting her arm through her daughter 's , led her into the house . Over a glass of cold tea she asked about the gossip in Dumur , the fashions , and what the prospects for Tad Green 's reelection were . Neither mentioned the trial , Leo Platt , Rene , or even Butch , but Gulla showed her daughter the long , strap-iron hinges she had had Ruedy put on the girl 's door , hinges stronger than any put on the stable doors that had to withstand animal force . " It ' s getting so you ca n't trust nobody  --  with so many strangers coming through  --  " At last Annette escaped . And , standing at the high windowsill of her room , she looked through the hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little whirlwind thatp129moved across it in a growing pillar of dust . Already the sprinkled wetness of the storm was gone . Although Butch watched his chance , Slogum House was so seldom free of strangers that for almost a week Annette was successful in avoiding him . Then , when Gulla was in the cellar , and Hab away , he slipped down to lurk in the dusky hall , silent for an hour , until he cornered the girl , backed her against the wall , his hands shaking , his long slit of a gun butt between the eyes to the man , he let her get away , get clear out into the yard where two strange cowboys had stopped to water their horses . Pulling up her full skirts , Annette swung to the saddle of Dodie 's old pony , and , whippingto both sides with the long reins , she escaped in a lumberinggallop around the hogback to Ruedy , sobbing heavily all the way . Before her story the father grew white under the tan of sun , and in his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the old Grossrnutter herself . Now at last it was enough , he told himself , starting on the run to the house for his shotgun . But before he got to the door he slowed . His face graying , sagging like an old sack suddenly empty , he slumped to the doorstep and dropped his hands forward in his Slogum helplessness . After a while , his eyes on the ground before him , he began to talk , making difficult , hesitant words . It was unthinkable , abscheulich , this . They must go away . Yes , go away , Annette nodded vaguely over the soaked lace of her handkerchief , with the thought of Rene already upon her . And then Ruedy , too , began remembering . They could n't even make a living except in that one way , Gulla 's way . And before the shame of it the father 's whole world disintegrated as a clod of earth in a gray flood.  | But from his debasement a dark anger against himself grew up , a cold and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to face Gulla . Either Butch went now , and for always , he would say , or Tad Green should collect the reward . He , not a Slogum now , but a Ruedy , would go to the sheriff with the whole story . Leaving Annette , her eyes round and afraid , to follow on her horse , the father started over the hogback . With all the dust and sweat of his hurry upon him , Ruedy stopped at Gulla 's door , but even now he dared not push himself in without permission , and by the time she would look up he was picking at his broken nails , unable to lift the pale gray of his eyes to her face as he tried to tell what he had come so fast to say . Before his stammering she leaned back in her corset to laugh as at a very good joke . Annette was a silly , flighty girl . Butch did n't mean anything  --  not with his nieces . Anyway , he would be gone soon , and just now she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the dusky hall towards Spring Branch Canyon . But he could not take the open path over the hogback . Instead he went the long way around , sneaking through the canyons , like a mangy coyote to his stinking nest . Because he could n't stand the puttery work of the gardens to-day , he went up the bluff to his limestone quarry , to set wedges and swing his heavy old pick maul over his shoulders until the canyon echoed , cracking out flat white slabs and then dragging them on his stone sled to the chute that slid them into a waiting pile in a gully above the brush . He did not notice the evening fragrance of his flowers on the rising wind , not even when the little antelope came pattering over the stony ledge to find him . Gulla hunched over her desk later than ever these nights , but she made no plans for expansion now , and instead of looking to the eraser that was to remove one rancher name afterp131another from the confines of the red semicircle , her eyes moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wrote regularly to Fanny , formal little notes adapted from the Lady 's Letter-Writer she got with her magazine subscriptions , giving the child no hint of the trouble at Slogum House or the departure of Ward . But at the slightest creak of the floor boards outside her door , she looked up to the gun and waited . Soon it was as though Annette had never come riding fast from Slogum House around the hogback to her father at all . She was very gay and unpredictable as a broncho 's heels , encouragingnew admirers , playing one against the other , spreadinga loop for wily-footed Clancy Haw of the Diamond B , taking on the mayor of Fairhope and the owner of the Bar UY ranch , safely beyond Gulla 's ambitions , and rarely free of settler fights . The girl seldom saw Rene any more , and although he left little notes for her in the hollow of a tree near the lower crossingof the Niobrara , it was n't often she could make an excuse to stop for them , and then sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom and read the penciled words :  --  This morning the prairie roses in the horse pasture had dew on them , like the tears on your cheeks from crying , and I wished that the sun would come and make you happy . Often Annette had Dodie saddle the new white-stockinged black Tad Green gave her , sometimes to stand in the barn for hours before she dared leave the security of her barred door . Now and then Cellie , looking pale too this hot summer , went with her . Together the girls rode across Oxbow Flat towards the Niobrara and walked through the dappled shade of the chokecherry patches or sat under the spreading cottonwoods and watched the orioles in their swinging pouch nests overhead . Sometimes they took their hammocks along ,  | slung them on the hooks Dodie put up for them in an ash grove on a school section that Gulla had leased up this hard year , leased away from Bill Masterson , who needed it for the little herd money he made . In the cool of evening the girls came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late soapweedsfor the parlor vases and new cattails for behind the pictures of Ruedy 's sisters . They went out together and came back as always , but there was little to say between them . Butch kept away from the lower halls pretty well since Annette called him Tit-Ear . Instead he took to riding out almost every night . " Got ta have a little air , " he was driven to explain to the watching Gulla . But one afternoon she came back from the post office and found him at Annette 's door with a crowbar and his skinning knife , hacking and prying away , the floor covered with splintered wood . And from the girl inside came little choking sobs as from a frightened child . Before Butch heard the soft sound of her feet on the hall runner the woman was upon him like a longhorn cow smelling fresh blood . " So  --  ca n't even let your niece alone  --  you dirty old boar hog  --  " she told him , her arms resting on her high stomach , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you git for Mexico . " Butch set the crowbar against the door and snapped the blade of his knife in and out of the stag handle . " There ai n't no hell of a hurry  --  Sis , " he said , easily , as he dropped the knife into his pocket and smoothed his hair down under his hat . " You ' 11 be needin ' me  --  " I never need you kind . " " The hell you do n't ! How about that business over in the  --  " Gulla cut him short . " Do n't be forgetting , Butch , that you ' re worth a thousand  --  dead or alive . "  |p133The  man 's thin mouth fell open like the loosened jaws of a steel trap . " Well , you goddamned  --  " Gulla moved upon him again , the neglected hairs on her upper lip black as ink strokes . " No names from you  --  you Haber skunk , you bastard . And to-morrow you git . " The man swaggered a little , stretched a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out a handful of broken peanuts and finally a folded paper . " Like hell I ' 11 git . You need me . That there  --  " he said , thumping the gray bit in his palm  --  " that there ' s a copy of what your high-falutin ' daughter left in a tree down by the river . Carryin ' on behindyour back with a damn , dirty forriner ! " " That all ? " Gulla asked . But she took the note to her room , saying no more about Mexico . After that Gulla openly watched Annette , putting her to sleep with Cellie and coming to the bed late every night . And while the girl made no attempt to see Rene so far as the mother knew , her animation died , she took no interest in Deemer of the Bar UY or Tad Green or even the mayor of Fairhope , who sang his romantic baritone well , batted his eyes most flirtatiously , had a drake-tail curl on his forehead , and no wife . At first Gulla humored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who controlled half a county , that she had a headache after he drove forty miles of sandhill trails , to see her , Gulla lost patience . Nothing but a do-less , shiftless Slogum , like her father , like all the rest . It was enough to drive a mother who wanted to do something for her children crazy . The daughter gave her no reply . Surprisingly like Ruedy in a new and patient silence , she went out to help Babbie , who was already thickening up fast and pretty sick in the mornings . The poor little thing cried a lot now  --  heavy gray tears rollingslowly as she worked . Once or twice she sneaked down into Spring Slough , but Gulla kept an eye on her and always had Dodie fetch her back . Once the girl had the butcherp134knife , was just sitting there looking at it , Dodie said , his eyes miserable as he made the difficult words of it . Gulla tried to be kind to the girl , but the work had to be done and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Men do n't value what falls into their hands like a rotten-ripe plum , for nothing . It ought to be worth a dollar , even on the ground with Babbie . Besides , a girl could n't take proper care of herself out in a ditch somewhere , the woman had tried to tell her . But the stupid little thing did n't seem to understand and now she was in for it again . After Gulla caught Butch at Annette 's door with the crowbar , he kept upstairs more , skulking like some huge , clumpy coyote in the shadows . But he seemed much pleasanter , sittingaround , dropping his peanut kernels into his open mouth , and looking at the mail-order catalogues . He shaved regularly , stroked his stringy moustache ends in crescents , kept his hair trimmed up a little about his shoulders , and spent his Mexico money on a new suit and a fine pair of boots , embroideredand appliqued . He tried to make friends with both of the twins now , particularly Cellie . Cash spent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails , listening to Butch blow . But Hab kept aloof and alone , never entering a room or even a hall where Butch was . And often while Cash seemed to sleep , his brother stood just inside the darkness of his doorway , hand on the butt of his gun , watching the stocky man lumber up and down the empty hall , like a heavy , clumsy animal impatient with waiting . None of this escaped the little pig eyes of Gulla . Every evening she laid the cards about her , and after studying them carefully pulled on her flannel sneakers and went up to listen at the thin wall of the sewing room . Twice after the cards ran well and the house was asleep , she went in to Butch , alone , giving orders , the brother crunching peanuts as she talked.  |p135One  bright , moonlit night , when Slogum House had been quiet as any settler 's dugout for several days , Annette complained of a headache and went to bed early , the mother taking a powder and a glass of water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the white moonlight of Oxbow Flat and Gulla was apparently in the passageway upstairs , the girl came through her door and , gathering up her skirts , slipped out , moving swiftly from shadow to shadow and up a gully toward the moon-swept hogback . Cellie , her face to the wall in her pretense of sleep , had wanted to kiss her sister good-bye , but she was afraid . Besides , Gulla had managed well against any display of affectionbetween the Slogums , even between the twins . So Cellie lay still and listened for the soft sound of the mother in the passageway , the pillow moistening unnoticed under her cheek . And before Annette was well started up the hogback , carrying only a nightgown and her little Bible in a flour sack , Butch and Hab and Cash went out too , boots in hand , with Gulla looking after them from her dark doorway . " Make it a good scare ; make him beg and bawl , " she had told them . The three men went around the east road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogback just as Annette and Rene were getting on their horses . Hab swung his rope over the young Frenchman 's head , caught him about his chest and arms , and jerked him from his shying young horse . Before Rene could get to his feet the two brothers were upon him , spreading him on his back , Hab 's jacket over his face . Twice the youth almost got away , but the rope held , and even so Butch had to knuckle his windpipe to bring him flat to the ground at last , still lunging and kicking , with Annette helpless on her snorting horse in the white moonlight . But when Butch slit his pants and Rene began to beg and cry , the girlp136struck her horse and was off down the hogback , the brothers looking after her in satisfaction , prepared to leap out of Rene 's reach as they released him . But Butch was not yet done . Even at the very last the two Slogums , seeing actual blood , might have let the strugglingyouth get away , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him still enough . Then , wiping his knife on his pants , Butch got up , snapped the blade down , and , signaling the Slogums to come on , rode away . Slowly Cash followed him , but Hab leaped to his horse and , spurring hard , rode directly toward Slogurn House . Rene , half up on one elbow , cursed them in cold , hard fury . " I ' 11 live to see the last damn one of you in hell ! "  |p137THE  quiet shadows of evening crept up from the depths of Spring Branch Canyon until only the highest tips of the cottonwoodsand the sandstone capping of the far bluffs were touched by the bright sun . Somewhere a woodpecker hammered , and far down the little stream a thunderpump complainedand then was silent . Deep in the cooling shadows Ruedy Sloguin sat on his doorstep , his violin waiting across his thin knees . Several times he picked it up and stroked the strings with his callousedfingers . But he knew there could be no music this evening , nothing to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night on the hogback . Once he thought he might try , very softly , a Schnaderhiip f el he recalled from his childhood , one the Grossmutter used to dance with her fine young Schatz in her mountain-village home . But he knew it could not lilt and whirl and be gay in the still , dead air of the canyon , not on this day . And so Ruedy put the violin away and tried to weave a soporific pattern of household duties for his hands , but when a soapy plate slipped from his fingers to the floor he tiptoed over the pieces and fled to his garden . Even there he could see nothing better than replacing a few rocks that the little antelope had kicked loose as it leaped the ditches and cascades . And as he stooped over his task the gentle animal came trotting from the brush to nozzle his cheek . Stiffly Ruedy straightened himself and put his arm over the tawny neck . But as he scratched the clean , bristly hair between the young prongs , his weary eyes still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to give up to the knowledge of the things of the night before on the hogback . Leaving the little antelope to follow him sadly to the door , Ruedy climbed the ladder to the low loft and went to stand over the cot at the window . Even in the duskiness young Rene 's face was bleached of all the tawny color of wind and sun  --  putty white . His tongue was silent , drained of its bitterness at last , and his unblinking eyes turned toward the bare rafters , their stare empty as the future before him . Once more Ruedy knew that a doctor should be brought , but he could not make the words . " Promise , " Rene had begged of him the night before , " promise you wo n't let anybodyget at me , not anybody . " And his horror-whitened face had been so stripped of all human defense , so pitifully naked , that Ruedy had to agree ; even if the boy died he had to agree . Slowly the man went down the ladder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of guarding . Several times he stirred vaguely in the growing darkness , as though to do something , something drastic and violent . Once he even got up and struck a match to look at his shotgun inside the door . But he hung it back and went to the step again , letting his corded hands drop to his knees . The latening moon came up red over the eagles ' nest at the head of the canyon . Tongues of light pushed down between the slim cottonwoods , searching out the little house , the gardens and the pools , the little antelope sleeping in a plot of fragrant clover . But Ruedy was still hunched in the shadows , heavy as a waterlogged stone . And up in the loft young Rene Dumur lay alone in the black darkness , his hands gripping the edges of the cot , his nails cutting the wood as though they were claws of iron . At Slogum House the day was quiet enough . Butch was still there , up early in the morning , scattering peanut shellsp139freely through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even the trots , to delay his going . And Gulla could only plod up and down behind the closed door of her room , the broad felt soles like the padded feet of some large animal . Yet she knew they had not failed her last night . She had seen Annette come running , her face like wet calcimine , her eyes round and dark and miserable in the dim light of the hall . And almost before Gulla could gather up the circle of cards from the floor , the ace of diamonds , the success card , last of all , Hab had come in alone , the first time in five years of night work at Slogum House . Without any sign at all to the mother , he hurried up the stairs and drew back into the darkness , waiting . Not far behind him Cash looked cautiously in at the door . His boots under one arm , hand on his holster , he tiptoed up the steps . But as he turned down the hall , Hab was against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , watching below , there was nothing but the boots bumping down the stairs , the empty legs swaying a little as Cash fled to his own room . Almost immediately the screen door banged and Butch came stomping in , making no bones of his return at all . Gulla stood like a broad , dark hogshead in his way , but he only pushed his thick palm in her face , kicked a boot aside , and stalked away along the upper hall , his spurs clinking . Moving her loose , quivering body as fast as she could , Gulla hurried through the dark passageway to the sons ' room to smell out this new thing between the brothers  --  and just when she needed them together the most . She listened long and straining , the silence pounding in her cars , and so she did not hear Annette rise with sudden urgency from her place beside the frightened Cellie and go out again , with bandages and pins and a jar of clover-leaf salve.  | But there was only the torn earth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlit grass , to show that anythinghad happened at all . A moment the girl was paralyzed , her mouth like a drying wire cut in her white face , and then once more she fled from the place , stumbling over bunchgrass and into the sharp spears of the soapweeds as she ran . And so the yellow sun of a quiet morning rose on a dull day at Slogum House . Two freighters stopped for the nooning and a dusty cowboy or two loped through . That was all , except that when the yard was empty a hawk swooped down on one of Libby 's white pullets . Dodie heard the squawking and came running out of the barn , waving the manure fork , making a loud whooping without any words . But the hawk moved away heavily and unhurried , out on Oxbow Flat , the pullet hanging limp in his claws . Cellie was up early , hovering in the hall for a word with Gulla . But even as the girl waited she held her trailing ruffles in her small , plump hand for flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got into her corduroy pants and rode out across the burning heat of Oxbow Flat towards the Niobrara , slowly , knowing she could not have faced the mother with even a word of protest against whatever horrible thing had been done in the night . All day Annette lay on her side of the bed , staring into the green-blinded gloom . Several times Gulla sent Babbie to her door with a tray or a glass of lemonade , but the sound of her knocking always echoed as from an empty room and so the girl took everything back to the kitchen , until she had a row of stale trays across the back of the work table , not knowing what else to do . Once or twice Gulla stopped her heavy plodding to wonder at this daughter . No more pride or spunk than a mangy pup  --  or an Ohio Slogum . Pouting all day over a little begging and slobbering from that Rene , andp141him nothing but a worthless river rat who ' d never have a cent to buy the pretty things a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was night again , and another Slogum supper over , this time with only Gulla and the two sons at the table for the freighters to see . Although the mother tried to make talk , not even Cash pretended to listen , and once she noticed that Hab 's hand slopped the coffee he was sipping from his spoon . " Too much tobacco , " she told him , trying to have it sound like joshing . Cash threw back his head to make a laugh , a loud noise over the empty table . When he heard it he fell to his food again , his face dark-flooded under the tan and the week 's crop of reddish stubble . All the evening the parlor door was closed . The freighters played seven-up and pitch on the oilcloth of their dining table a while and finally dragged away upstairs to their bunks , talking low among themselves , without laughing or horseplay , and no business for the extra girls at all . It was late when Cellie came in , without stopping to explain where she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . But she turned to look after the girl , wondering what hi got into mushheadedlittle Cellie , into all those around her . Once more she made the rounds of the upstairs . From the freighters ' bunks came the comfortable little sighs and snorings of honest hours in the saddle and on the post wagon , and from the sewing room the buzz and roar and snarl of Butch asleep , the old couch creaking under the regular rise and fall of his heavy chest . Only in the room of the sons was there silence , the dead silence of guarded wakefulness . The next morning Annette managed to get out of the house while Gulla napped for the night 's vigilance . Veil ends blowing from her little brown hat , she rode down Spring Slough and along the Niobrara to the little meadow where once a summer shower ran in waves over the windrows of drying hay while Rene held her in his arms . But to-day the meadow was bare and the house above it empty  --  with one lone wasp droning in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not here , had not been here at the house at all . Then , because she could not help it , Annette thought of Bullard , buried face down on the bank of the Willow , and for a moment the veil clung to her wet cheek . When it blew free again in the hot wind she got on her horse and rode hard for Leo Platt 's . But the locator 's little house was empty too , and so there was only Ruedy left . After a week Annette was still riding up Cedar Creek to Spring Branch Canyon , keeping up well along the bluff so her voice would not carry to the little loft of Ruedy 's house , and where she could not be seen . The father , knowing it was best so , watched for her coming every day , telling her honestly how it was , with high fever in the night and wild talking . But finally he could say that Rene was recovering , much as a healthy colt recovers , hidden away alone in a deep draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear this thing her father pictured , she let her eyes escape to the refuge of the bluffs . " It is quiet here in your canyon , " she said at last . " Quiet as in a church . " Ruedy saw her discomfiture and licked his sun-cracked lips in embarrassment . " Yes , " he agreed , hoping to make some light , some not too stupid words between them . " Yes , but I think my garden is better for the nose than the dead air of the churches . " Without answering , the girl touched her stockinged black that Tad Green had given her and galloped away , Ruedy climbing the side of the bluff to look after his daughter , riding fine and free with the easy running of the horse . At the bend that led toward Spring Slough the girl remembered to lift a fringed gauntlet to the father she knew would be watching.  |p143As  she waved , the horse shied and out of the willows below her came Butch , spurring hard , his hair flopping under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father did and , using the quirt she carried lately , was away amid flying gravel . By the time Ruedy got to the top of the ridge , pantingwith his running , she was out of the canyon in sight of Slogum House , riding quietly homeward , the only moving thing on all of Oxbow Flat . This time Ruedy walked boldly , without knocking , through Gulla 's door , his hat not in his hand but pushed far back from the anger in his pale eyes . At last it was enough . These things that were happening here he could not prevent , but neither would he remain to look upon them any longer . Either Butch went now or he , Ruedy , would go and take Annette with him  --  go as Ward and Libby had gone . Before he was done Gulla rose against him , cutting off his retreat , standing wide as the door and seeming as high , her face gray as a pan of cold oatmeal . So  --  now he , too , was coming to plague her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plough-galled horse , biting , laying maggots to rot and fester and eat . She had borne his children , fed them , kept their skinny butts warm , and his too . And after giving him the best years of her life all he could do was encourage the bunchquittingbastards , come sneaking in himself to tell her she could kiss his ass . He was going with the rest . Well , he ' d see she had ways of stopping him and his father-loving daughter . . . . Slowly Ruedy lifted his hand , brought his open palm across her mouth . He did it wearily , without surprise , as a thing made habitual by the half-conscious desire of long years . Then he pushed past the gasping woman and went away up the hogback , wondering how far he would get before a bullet from Slogum House found his back . The tall , sparse grass made little swishing sounds against his legs , and the clean , wind-rippled sand yielded kindly to the prints of his feet . Ap144late-singing bobolink rose high into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat wings , came down in slants and runs , scattering his song over all of Oxbow Flat . But the impact of the bullet and the tardy echo of a rifle shot never came . Late that night Gulla watched for Butch , and when he came down the deserted stairs she called him into her room , held out five gold pieces to him on the thick of her palm . " Here ' s the money again , and there ' s a good horse down in the back shed to get you over the border . " " Aw , Sis , what ' s the hurry ? " he argued , his cupped hand of peanuts poised halfway to his mouth . " The sheriff ' 11 be along looking for you about to-morrow . I ' d hate to have him find my good brother here . " Butch crunched the kernels , dug up another handful , and , dropping the shells to the floor , filled his trap of a mouth again , not bothering to slip off the bitter brown skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his munching , " if they get me they ' 11 take those two poop-house stinkers a yourn along with me . " When he got no reply he swaggered on , " There ' s that Bullardbusiness , you know . " " My boys did n't have nothing to do with that  --  " " But who ' 11 believe ' em when I get through tellin ' mystory ? And then there ' s the geldin ' the other night  --  " " The what ? " Gulla demanded , her wide mouth hangingloose . " The  --  Oh , hell , did n't you want your fine Annette 's feller scairt out ? Well , he ' s scairt out  --  for good . " Slowly Gulla was up , her shadow moving ponderously along the wall toward the man . " You dirty dog ! " she shouted against him , forgetting the sleeping freighters , the second-floor girls , everybody . " You dirty Haber bastard ! " But Butch only fished another peanut from his pocket ,  |p145|po|p|ped  it , threw the shells at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sprawl his boots across Libby 's ruffled bedspread , flop his greasy hair across her lace pillow shams . A long time Gulla stood , her arms helpless and heavy as sand . Finally she began a noiseless walking up and down the rag runner of her room , her hands folded across her stomach , the money wet in her palm . So , that was what was behind the things she had seen in Slogum House the last week : Annettedead as tallow , Ruedy 's calloused hand on the mouth of his wife , Hab and Cash with guns between them . And she could n't say that it had n't been her plan  --  could n't admit that she had lost the whip hand over Butch . Suddenly she thought beyond Slogum House , to the night on the hogback ; to Rene himself . Running her finger up the almanac , she saw that the night this thing had been done the moon was in the Secrets . That meant trouble : bleeding , swelling , rotting sores in calves or colts . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how he ' d been fixed . There would n't be any counting on Ruedy in court , nor on the lovesick Annette . And with that Bullard stink still fresh , Platt and the preacher and his mob would n't let it get to court . The whole country would come tearing up around Slogum House like hungry wolves , yelling , " Burn the sonsabitches out ! Shoot them down like dogs ! " With the breath coming hard in her thick chest , Gulla went out into the yard , but there it was as close as in her passageway . The windmill stood silent ; no air stirred anywhere . Up beyond the hogback a young coyote yipped , and then another , trying their new voices , and far out on Oxbow Flat a prairiedogowl hooted . At the sound of the night bird the woman crossed her fingers and hurried back into the house . Putting the money that she still clutched in her palm carefully away , she took out her cards . Several times she shuffled them , her fingers awkward , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . When she let the ace of spades escape her and lie face up , black and foreboding , she threw the whole pack against the wall , scattering them like speckled , red-backed leaves in the wind . Towards morning she tucked a letter of tablet paper into her hand satchel , spread her black wool voile over a chair back , and set out her good shoes , with a nightgown and soap and towel ready to pack . Then she pulled the wire to Dodie 's bell and slipped in to call Annette . " Do n't forget to eat hearty , " she said matter-of-factly , as though all . the things of the last few days had never been . Soon after daylight the yellow-wheeled buggy moved quietly down behind the sheds into Spring Slough and on southward into the hills . The air was still with morning ; the sky empty of everything except the eagles from the crag above Ruedy 's place , hanging in far black splashes against the brightening rose of another day . Around two o'clock Gulla pulled up behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south road , and lifted her veil for the liveryman 's recognition . " Keep the rig out of sight until you get word from me  --  and you ai n't seen any of us if you ' re asked . Woman 's business , you know , " she said , and winked to him . The liveryman nodded , spit into the empty dust of the road , and stood looking after the two , the stocky , heavy-footed , moustached woman and the handsome , rustling figure of Annette , shadow-eyed and listless behind her heavy veil , yet moving with a fashionable switching of her lifted , flaring skirts toward the little red depot . Scratching under his greasy hat , he pulled it down again , unhooked the horses , and backed the buggy into the farther shed . In three days they were back . They had Ward with them , so weak and sick he had to be taken from the train on a cot and put in the back of a spring wagon . With Gulla hunched beside him on a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her handkerchief , they started for Slogum House . The boy never spoke all the way , only lay with his white face turned from his mother , now and then a drop of clear water slipping across the bridge of his nose to the pillow . When they got home the yard was empty , not even Dodie loping out to take the bits of the horses . But when the little hunchback saw who it was he came sneaking from the back shed , his lip cut and a gash down his cheek . Knowing that it was for his loyalty , Gulla thanked him with a pat on the high shoulder and brought a foolish stuttering to his tongue as he led the horses away . Inside the house Ruedy and Cellie were eating at the centre places of the long table , quietly , for those beyond the archway to see . In the freighters ' dining room there was a strange attention to food chewing , with no joking or horseplayand no looking up at all at the booming man-laughs that rolled through Slogum House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the door of the twins ' private parlor , stood Hab , his hand on his gun . Without a sign to him Gulla kicked the door open . The pretty little room was torn up : the lace curtains ripped from the windows ; the embroidered pillows scattered ; the centre table upset , its tall wild-rose lamp shattered , its seashells , souvenirs , photographs , and doilies all over the floor , tracked into tobacco spit . On the rose silk settee lay Cash , his boots up on the back , his face purple-red , a whiskey bottle on the floor beside his dangling hand . Butch , in sock feet , was astride a little gold chair , telling dirty stories . When Cash saw his mother he tried to get up and slipped sprawling to the floor , his gun flying from his holster , his elbow sending the whiskey bottle rolling in a pooling halfcircle . " Whiskey-swilling hog , " Gulla called him , her arms folded over her dusty black voile . " And you  --  " to her brother  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your tit-ear sticking out  --  " Butch , stooping to pull his boots on , clapped his hands to his hair , holding it close . And by the time Cash was on his feet the woman had slammed the door on them and pushed the heavy bolt in place . Nodding to Hab , she hung up her hat , and together she and Annette went to the Slogum table while Ruedy helped Hab and Dodie carry Ward up the steps . A long time the father sat beside the bed of this youngest son , his dry leathery hands seeking hopeless refuge in each other . He looked at the fever-thin face of the boy , the gray lips , the faint , shallow stirring of his chest  --  and was broken by the misfortune that fell upon this first one with the courage to depart from Slogum House . Typhoid , the doctor at Cheyenne had said  --  a long , slow recovery at the best , dependingmostly upon skillful nursing . As the father watched , the boy opened his sunken , yellowed eyes and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of arrowheads on the wall . Then he knew where he was , and the thin fingers gripped the sheet and a sob came from deep within his bony breast . Just one , and then there was only the buzz of a belated wasp against the screen , and the bowed head of the father , his face lined and scarred as the frost-checked sandstone bluff above his home . Before the week was up Gulla had Libby back at Slogum House . The day the girl returned she slipped to Ward 's room before touching the pins of her hat . The blind was partly down , but even in the half light of the afternoon the boy was restless and yellowed and gaunt , with the dead skin of a sick old man pulled tight over the bones of a child . Libby jerked the blind high and looked down upon this luckless brother who was a helpless little boy again . When Ward saw who it was he smiled a bit and lifted a hand vaguely in greet/ing and was off in a light sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hot , dry paper . That night , when the kitchen work was done and Ward sleeping quietly , with a moistness to his temples , Libby walked out across the yard . Refusing the horse Cash offered her , with Hab looking darkly on , she climbed the hogback standing against the purple of evening and went down into Spring Branch Canyon . A long time she sat on the doorstep , her arms folded on her thighs , the father on the chopping block , his pipe red in the light of the new moon that was pale as a sliver of tin . There was no talking . Everything seemed much as always , even as it was the night this eldest daughter came running to say good-bye . Only then the boy Ward was three hundred miles away , and Libby had never walked through wind-singing pines beside Leo Platt . " Well , she got us back  --  " the daughter said at last , as from a long , deep weariness . " Yes  --  " Ruedy spoke sadly over the dead pipe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was babying the boy  --  " She would say that  --  anything to keep him from having the father . " But that is not all  --  " he said , rising to tread the gravel with his heavy work shoes . " There is more  --  " " Butch ? " " Yes  --  yes  --  " he ended lamely . He could not tell her about Rene to-night . But on her way home a slight figure rose uncertainly from the grass along the path , whispering a frightened , " Libby , Libby  --  I have to talk to you  --  I have to  --  " It was Annette . With foreboding Libby followed her from the path into the vague darkness of the ridge . On a bare place the girl crumpled down , crying . " They  --  they didi that to Rene  --  " her mother 's prudish tongue standing in her way . " Who  --  what ? " " They  --  Hab roped him and  --  Butch , he  --  Butch , he gelded Rene . " Libby stepped back , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would do even this to keep Annette . There was , then , nothing beyond them , beyond Gull a and these tools of hers . The day the telegram came to Hot Springs luck had seemed against Ward , against both of them . The boy sick and the mother finding it out first , getting him home , tolling her daughter , her cook and watchdog , back to Slogum House like tolling a wild cow into a corral by her calf . But Old Gulla would have caught them somehow , even if Ward had n't taken typhoid ; caught them as Hab brought back unruly critters who broke away from the herd , a rope around the horns , dragged until the hide was bare and bleeding . Yes , it was well to know that there was nothing at all beyond this woman who was their mother . Taking Annette 's soft hand as she used to when they were little girls , Libby led her to the path and back to Slogum House , letting her whisper out her misery all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house she pushed the girl towards her bed . When she was gone through her own door , Libby walked deliberately , and without knocking , into Gulla 's room . " What sort of monster have I for a mother ? " she demanded of the woman who rose at this intrusion , a dark , angry bulk before her little desk lamp . " It was n't my doings , " Gulla defended , knowing well what the girl meant , nor pretending . " It was the work of you yellow-gut Slogums  --  " " Oh , no . It was you Habers , you and that dirty Butch , " the girl told her , the words coming slowly as deep ice breakingp151in the spring , and then faster . " Nothing is too bad for you , you low-down , dirty , scheming , murdering Haber trash ! " " Get out , get out of here ! " Gulla yelled , reached for Ward 's twenty-two on the wall , her loose fat gray and shaking . But this one time a daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . A long time she looked down upon the mother . " You ' re done , " she said , at last , and sadly . " You ca n't hurt me or any of us more than now . We ' 11 have to live long to eat up the soup you ' ve cooked for us this summerCalmly she took the rifle from the woman 's lax hands , ejected the shell to spin on the floor before her , and , setting the gun against the wall , slammed the door and was out in the night , her long skirts lifted , walking fast towards the sandhills . Long after the sliver of flint-gray moon was lost in the mists of the western horizon , her ankles scratched to bleeding by the soapweeds , the sand-cherry bushes , and the prairie roses that perfumed the low pockets of the hills , Libby rememberedWard and his need . Afraid , she came into the boy 's room and saw that it was time . He was alone , his skin hot and dry , his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying that she was gone and would never come back , his sister , his twin sister . Again he caught the little rabbits of his childhood , held them in his hands , their hearts pounding against his palms , and wept for their fright and because he had to let them go . He chased the old dog Wolf through the yard again , his boy eyes fever-old and wild , all the violence and fear and hatred of his life upon his tongue . And then he became sly , , drawing away from Libby 's hand , mumbling of the wooden plug he drove into the rifle of his brother Hab , to blow him to hell-an ' - gone , hell-an ' - gone , hell  --  The next hour Libby worked to get the fever down with camomile tea and long sponging of the boy 's body , the skin dried tight to the bones as on the carcass of the buckskin colt killed by lightning in the horse pasture two years ago . Once Gulla came to the door with three black chicken feathers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , but the daughter who had taken the rifle from her so recently stood against her , and so the mother lumbered away , the stairs creaking under her hastening weight . After a while Libby sent Dodie through the darkness for Ruedy , and then to ride hard to Dumur for the doctor . The father came panting , his hand to his aching side . " You should have stopped to spit under a stone , " the daughter whispered to him , pretending lightness . Without replying , Ruedy let himself down on a stool beside the bed , the shadows from the screened lamp sharp on his cheekbones as he watched . By dawn Ward was quiet and asleep , his forehead moist , his blistered , twitching lips silent at last . When the doctor rode into the yard Libby went to the father . Slowly he lifted his vague , reddened eyes to his daughter . " It is day , " she told him . Although Libby spoke seldom enough to the others of SlogumHouse , things ran smoother from the moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first night Ward 's fever rose less alarmingly , until it was almost gone and he ate his fat hen broth without complaint . The freighters , well-fed , were good-natured again , and after a big washing that spread in six long lines down the Slogum yard , the bluing streaks disappeared from the swirling petticoats of the twins . And the first time Hab was safely away from the house Libby went up to pound the wooden plug from his rifle with the ramrod and carried it away to keep . If anything happened to this dark Haber among them , she preferred to save Ward self-blame.  |p153While  the eldest of the Slogum sons kept close to his room as a hunted animal to its burrow , riding out only for short lopes as a coyote forages , Cash spent most of his time with Butch in the crow 's nest , where Libby had moved Old Tit-Ear the evening she came home and found him sprawled across her bed , peanut shells all over her floor . Although Butch grumbled , he went . Nor did he go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brace , Libby took off the hinges and , carrying the door out into the yard , chopped it into kindling for the cookstove , leaving the room open and public as the hall . And because Gulla had seen the daughter stand at the window and thoughtfully swish the water over the poisoned fly paper many a time , she put up the tray for the crow 's nest herself . Nor was her uneasiness lessened when , two days after Libby followed Ward to Slogum House , Leo Platt loped openly into the yard , and with the reins over his arm came to the porch . Without a word to anyone except to Babbie about the bread sponge , the girl hung up her apron , and swinging her hat by its green ribbon strings went out into the hot sunlight beside this enemy of her people  --  through the yard gate and away towards Ruedy 's place . Behind them all of Slogum House watched : Hab and Cash at separate windows upstairs , their guns heavy in their holsters , the older brother with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peephole of the crow 's nest , and Gulla at the hall door , her hands wrappingand unwrapping themselves in their apron . From the kitchen window Babbie saw the two go with a watering simple and happy as spring rain in her eyes , and at the sheds Dodie straightened up on the handle of his manure fork and looked after the girl with her green-sprigged flounces blowing . Only the twins , napping in their room , did n't see Libby walk openly away from Slogum House beside the tall browned locator , his hair strong and black and free , a loose-knotted red bandana blowing at his throat.  |p154But  as the two went up the sandy path of the hogback , the eager hoofs of the blue-roan horse close at their heels , they found only dull things to say to each other , stupid things , public as the wagon roads of the prairie . At the crest the man looked back upon Slogum House , like a nest of gray toadstoolsbelow them . " And this was to have been the day , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalled the plans left behind at Hot Springs and acknowledged the Slogum woman 's cunning , her power over them all . Then revolt against everything she represented swelled in the man 's throat , burst in a flood of protest . " I wo n't let that woman break us like a stick of diamond willow across her knee  --  " But the girl from Slogum House dared not listen , for she had seen distance in this man 's eyes , distance and the long , straight road . And so she had to shrug his gentle hand from her shoulder , gayly , lightly , as she had seen Annette do so often , and swing her hat as she laughed at him , even though her strong fingers crushed the good straw of its brim . Leo Platt saw only the laughing , and the lightness , so like the twins , and he knew that down below there Gulla was watching , probably watching to see that fool of a locator from the Niobrara brought in by one of the daughters of Slogum House . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even across his dark brows . " So that is what you are , " he said quietly . " What that hairy-eyed hell-cat down there has made of you , too  --  " Turning , he threw a rein over the neck of his horse and thrust a foot into the stirrup . But the girl could not give him the one light word needed now , could only hold her eyes to the far safety of Sundance Table , not over this man 's place , but over Rene 's deserted little house , where no one would ever live again . She held herself firm enough , her head steadyp155and her eyes , but still the man did not go . Stupidly he stood with one foot up in the stirrup , a hand on the horn that was solid and firm , seeing finally that the stillness was gone from Libby 's fingers , the golden sheen of sun on bunchgrass from her face . At last the girl spoke , her voice quiet and remote as the sandhills that blurred away behind her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " And how can it ever be otherwise now  --  ever be otherwise ? "  |p156BY  August many of the older settlers were dragging themselvesout of the country like hunger-driven cows who looked back , bawling , reluctant to leave the spot where lush grass once grew . Even as they pounded their bony teams eastward , the sunburnt men turned their faces to the western horizon , hoping for a last-minute rain to heal the cracked and broken earth , to justify one more try at it , somehow to stand off the sheriff and starvation one more season . Big homes of ten and twelve bare rooms , put up on tick in the first high optimism of rain on virgin soil , stood gray and deserted now  --  free lumber for the pretty room Gulla had planned , for the towering barn and the wide sheds that SlogumHouse should have , and for stock shelters in hidden pocketsin the hills . Unlimited lumber for the taking , and Gulla 's sons skulking in the dark halls of Slogum House , their guns naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until every cent of loose cash was drained from the country and the land no longer paid the cost of foreclosure . Banks pulled down their blinds , Eastern loan companies went broke , and from Cedar Flats across Sundance Table to Dumur and Brule homes stood empty and unclaimed until there were only the sod walls and cellar holes left , cellar holes with the limestones of the foundationscattered over the baked earth like bedraggled white hens scratching . For six years Gulla had to see the loan sharks squeeze the settlersdry , knowing she could have doubled the money everyp157year as she more than doubled everything she got her hands on , and by rights she should have had it . By rights she should have tithe land too , and yet she could n't even get out of Slogum House to pick up a few of the better places near the railroad or some of the lumber going to waste . Instead she was tied down by a good-for-nothing runaway boy come sneaking home sick , a whiskey-swilling son who had to be watched , a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and this Butch brother who used the cutting edge of his knife and got her blamed for it when all she intendedwas just a touch of the cold metal where it would do the most good . So , although Gulla had reached out her pudgy hand for the straying Slogums as easily as a range boss motions a puncher to round up the bunch quitters , she could n't even keep up with Fanny 's letters any more . Sometimes there were two of the neat little square envelopes unopened in her desk at a time : letters that spoke of the girl 's progress with piano and voice , her improved deportment , contacts she was making with very nice girls of well-to-do families  --  all as clear proof of the advancement of the Slogums as the rows of figures in Gulla 's little black book . And sometimes even these figures were a week or more behind , for there was little to water the tongue in the bare entries of freighters fed and satisfied . Nor did Ruedy slip into his old habit of crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he did n't have much stomach for the place since the night Rene came to him , particularly not with Butch Haber peering down from the crow 's nest upon his head . " Bag of s , " old Tit-Ear had called him once , back inOhio , and Ruedy had n't been able to do anything about it . Besides , there was work in Spring Branch Canyon , the difficult task of building for the life that remained to Rene Dumur . The injury healed well and quickly , for he had youth and the steel of sun and air and long sweating hours of labor within him . Besides , Butch knew his business . He never lost a pig or a calf or a colt . Yet when Rene walked the day away along the centre of the low , hot loft , nothing Ruedy could do seemed enough to coax him down the ladder to the pleasant room , even to eat . Like an injured animal he wished to hide his pain , drag it out of sight , growling when another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own food up too , trying to talk while they ate , to plan , but his words were like stones rolling in the deep pool at the head of Spring Branch Canyon , the ripples lost against the dark silent wall of volcanic ash . Then one evening , over fried young cottontail , Ruedy tried to suggest that perhaps Rene might like to go to Chicago to his mother for a while , maybe take up a profession . And when he tried to go on to say that he would send a little every month , Rene turned upon him like a bobcat Ruedy once saw up in Dakota , cornered in a washout by a prairie fire , eyes fiery and wild , fangs bared . And so Ruedy went away down the ladder . He could n't say that he , a Slogum , was only trying to help , nor could he tell Rene that many of his kind had led fine , useful lives , even become powerful , the actual despots of millions  --  astute , shrewd , forceful , makers of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much wind in a deserted doorway , and this also the grandson of Libbette Slogum added to the self-hatred that grew like a gall in a pine tree , hard and gnarled and bitter within him . Because Rene would not hear to a return to his home on the Niobrara , Ruedy got him to file on a homestead over the bluff to the southwest , where a spring watered a little meadow ringed away from all the world except at the narrow rocky bottle-neck canyon that opened into lower Spring Branch . They would call it Rene Creek . So the two went to the land office and then put up a little sod house and moved some ofp159Rene 's things in : a bed , a table , two benches , and the cookstove . Little more . His Sunday clothes , his books of poetry , his violin , and all the things of his happy childhood he piled in the yard and burned . And as he shook the smouldering things into flame with the pitchfork , the smoke climbed out of the shadowy canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , high pillar of blue , clearly visible from SlogumHouse , four miles away . Until Ward began to fill in a little at the hollows , Libby seemed much as always , except that she no longer made the quiet little songs about her work , and knit no more fernleafinsertion for the petticoats of the twins now that the long vigils on the hogback with the signal cloth ready were done . But with Ward up and eating a dozen times a day , Libby had to look squarely upon the life that was irrevocably hers . She got Dodie to tear away the little shelf from which a black cat once blinked down upon all that passed through the Slogum kitchen . Other things she put away too , including a new wood-brown dress with green velvet bowknots all down the front , bright as young corn in a settler 's field after a rain . And a little brown hat with a green bird perched saucily at the flat crown . With these things she put the two pressed harebells from the spring where Leo Platt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then finally there was nothing left to do but to face the things of Slogum House . Cellie no longer ran whispering and giggling to her twin , no longer rode out to the Niobrara with her ; instead she was often alone or with Cash , when he was n't loafing in the crow 's nest beside Butch , or out on the night range with him , planning no one could tell what dirty work . Gulla told her son this in a moment of anger , a dangerous thing now , with the growing insolence of Butch and his appetite for the test of strength she no longer dared face . For two hours after that she had waited with the twenty-two rifle she could n't use across her desk . But Cashp160was laughing with Butch in the crow 's nest and Gulla could not know whether it was about her or just another of her brother 's stories about the preacher and the whore . And as the still hot days of late summer passed , drowsy as the wasps under the porch eaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twins , little laughter rose from the private parlor , and the sewing room was empty of tissue-paper patterns , bolts of insertion and braid , or the clatter of the ruffler . To Libby , Hab still seemed on the side of Gulla , despite the appeal the ruthlessness of Butch must have for him , too . She thought of the scheming in his slit eyes , the lift of his lip over the beaver teeth that the dark moustache was to hide , and could n't see it as loyalty to the mother . He was like a coyote skulking in a draw , waiting , while two gray wolves fought over a hamstrung bull . No matter how it ended now , some day there would be a showdown with the locator from the Niobrara . And so Libby plunged into all the heavy work she could find . She washed the bedding of Slogum House , stringing out heavy lines of soogans from the freighters ' bunks , cheap , sheepherder soogans , never intended for water and dripping pools of color upon the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both floors with lye soap and sand to a velvetycream , or rode out to help the stuttering , excited Dodie when he needed a hand at fencing or to take down a windmill wheel to babbitt a boxing . And at night , hands blistered and her fine young body stiff and awkward as an old plough mare 's with the day 's weariness , the girl dropped into bed . In the meantime the family still ate at the Slogum table togetherand after supper moved to the parlor for a singing at the organ . But the solidarity was gone as Ruedy was gone . There were no silences at all any more , always a quick fillingp161in with small talk , and escape as soon as possible . The air seemed charged , like clouds rolling high , or a prairie fire smoulderingin down grass , waiting for a wind  --  any wind . " Smells like a herd a fetchin ' to stampede it across the country at the stompin ' of a gnat , " an old cowpuncher said , buckling his gun back on after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor for the night . Yet on the surface everything seemed much as always at Slogum House , except that most of the haying and the fencing , the round-up for early shipping , and the freighting for winterwas not done . No coal on hand , no salt or horse feed , the buttery almost empty . Even the west side studding was still bare , the new boards of Pastor Zug 's church warping in the willows of Spring Slough . No plans had been made for the weaning , branding , and trimming of the spring calves exceptthose dropped by the milk cows and cared for with the staghorn knife of Butch in the night . Nothing at all had been done about the new room for ladies that Gulla had planned with such anticipation . Almost alone Dodie had worked all the summer at the small jobs of the place . He cared for the stopping teams and the herds moving through . Every other day he looked after the Slogum cattle , helping late cows with their calving , throwing the thinning ones from the drouth-shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrinking water holes and the two rickety windmills . He kept an eye on the fence along Cedar Creek , wires cut every few days just above a quivering patch of bunch bogs , and Slogum cows stuck in the mud . With such help as he could get , mostly from Libby , he weaned the big bull calves that were pulling the older cows down in meat before winter , blabbing them with a flap of tin wired through the nose . If that did n't work , he added a few nails , point outward , and the kicking cow did the rest.  |p162Sometimes  Libby made special dishes for him , a flip-over pie from the ends of the crust , or a little cake frosted all around to take out on the range with him . And always she got the grin of his wide-spaced teeth , and his honest , stammering thanks as she watched him pound his slow old saddle horse away to count the stock . " You know  --  Miss Libby , " he told her once , " there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening he had his pigeons . Early in the summerDodie brought them home in the front of his shirt , gentle , pure white young birds that Old Moll up in the Willow gave him because he stopped on the bill above her place a long time to watch their first awkward flight . But she warned him about letting them settle about the barn and over the Slogum boys ' saddles . " They ' d take a pot shot at an angel if they got a ghost of a chance , knowing there ' d be no back shooting , " she said , her speech frank as her short , man-cut , graying hair . Libby let Dodie put up a box in the gable of the chicken coop with a piece of window glass and screening for the front and a little sliding door to be opened only an hour or so in the evenings . And because of the other things about Slogum House this summer , no one except Ward noticed the pigeons much until Libby thrust Butch back into the crow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peepholes large as his hairy fist and saw the birds take their hour of flight , circling far out upon Oxbow , their wings swift and free , white as snow against the purple sky of evening . He noticed , too , how Dodie looked after them from his milking in the cow lot , called to them with gentle little sounds when they settled , cooing , on the shed roof or the ridge of the crow 's nest of Slogum House . Watching them fly to the little hunchback 's shoulder to ride back to the coop , Butch filled his mouth with peanut kernels and chomped them noisily without removing the bitter brown skins.  |p163Then  one windy morning when Libby and Ward were both gone , the yard empty of strangers , and Dodie on the windmill platform tying the wheel out of gear to replace the pumprodpin , Butch came shambling out straight to the chicken coop . He pulled the string to the little sliding door and stood back . The pigeons hesitated a bit and then came flutteringinto the bright morning sun . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open prairie , while Dodie , hat blown from his rusty roach of hair , his shirt tail fanning out behind , clung to the bucking windmill wheel , his open mouth working in his helplessness . This was what Butch had come to see , and , teetering his heavy body on his boot heels , he smoothed the catfish ends of his moustache with his thumb , laughing aloud . And when the pigeons wheeled back over the yard he pulled his gun and dropped one in a flopping of white wings to the ground , the other flying in wild little circles overhead . Hard upon the echo of the shot Hab 's face showed at his window for one dark instant and was gone . Gulla came waddlingthrough the screen door , but seeing who it was , she scuttled back , holding the door against any slamming . Once more , and leisurely now , Butch lifted his revolver and the second pigeon dropped straight as a stone through the wind . Then he holstered the smoking gun and stalked to the house . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , slid through the manhole of the platform , and loped to the crippled bird . Gently , with the warmth of the soft breast against his palm , he wiped a drop of bright blood from the white feathers . But almost at once the wings went limp , the head dropped , the little eyes skinned with gray . And when the hunchback finally looked up at Slogum House his loose lips were drawn from his far-spaced teeth , in his face the slow , deep , remembering anger of injured earth.  | As Ward strengthened he spent a great deal of time down on the Niobrara or riding the hills with his gun and a spade , digging out coyote dens for the hides , blue and not yet prime , but worth a little in addition to the bounty on the scalps and the calves saved . A few times Libby went with the boy , but more and more she rode away alone from Slogum House for long trips of berrying or , after the early September frost , just to walk through the brightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow , the creepers blood-red against the silvery buffalo-berry brush that hung like smoke along the second bottom . She brought home wild plums sugarsweetand fragrant in milk pails hung from the saddlehorn , purple-stained sacks of wild grapes tied back of the high cantle , and arms full of goldenrod or purple fire stick for the vases of Slogum House . And beyond Ward and little Babbie and the hunchbacked Dodie she had no word , good or bad , for anyone on all of Oxbow Flat . And several times on moonlit nights Libby rode down toward Leo Platt 's place , tying her horse in a gully and moving from shadow to shadow towards the round-topped hackberrieson the rise of the house . Usually it was only a dark , desertedblock , with the smell of asters and tansy about it , and the soft blur that was the vining of bittersweet along the windows and up over the roof . But finally one evening light streamed from the windows upon the dry grass of the slope , and inside the bright room Leo Platt and two homeseekers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there upon a map spread over the table . Now and then they stopped to smoke , Leo lighting the three pipes from a sliver he held in the stove hearth until a blaze leaped upon it . Finally they nodded to each other in understanding , drank a cup of coffee together , and then the strangers picked up their lantern and went out to a covered wagon in the shade of the big cottonwood , talking low and full of hope together as twop165friendly laborers seeing the last leaving of a long task . Soon the light inside the dark-bowed canvas died , giving the wagon and its men back to the shadow of the moon-tipped tree . All this time Leo Platt was rolling up his maps , counting his surveying pins , linking the chain into a neat bundle , and checking the needle of his compass . The girl in the hackberryshadow saw that the locator moved with a warm friendlinessamong these things and knew again that she could n't take him from all that was his life , even if she could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peace between them . But she did not ride away , not even when Leo finally slumped to the stool beside his empty table and sat so a long time , lookingstraight before him , over his interlaced fingers , the lines of his young face already cut deep as folds in good leather . But when he dropped his head to his arms , the girl ran up the slope to her horse and dared not look back . Towards daylight , when Libby dragged herself in at the Slogum door , Gulla filled the hall at the foot of the stairs . " So , it ' s you , " she said , in cold satisfaction , shaking her head from side to side on her thick Haber neck . " You a coming in at this hour  --  " And when the girl gave her no reply , the woman 's mouth stretched into a sly , knowing viciousness . " It do n't look right , you know , a grown daughter , sneaking out all night with her girl-chasin ' , maiden-crackin ' father  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes pitchblackas thunder in the night . Then she drew herself up and , swinging her open hand back , brought it flat across the mother 's wide mouth . The blow rang sharp as the crack of a bull whip through all the silent house as the girl ran to her room . Barring the door behind her , she shook the pain from her knuckles and began to laugh . For the first time since her return to Slogum House she laughed , and did n't stop until she was wrung dry as a bleached bone on the prairie.  | The morning Libby left Hot Springs there had been nothing for Leo except a little note , saying that it was like the wide , cool lakes that shimmered in the dry heat of Sundance Table , all her planning to escape from the woman of Slogum House . Since then he had seen Libby only once from near , the few minutes he walked beside her to the top of the hogback . But often in the night he rode along the ridge where they had stopped to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the comfort of her presence . And in the daytime he worked to encourage the drouth-stricken settlers , to bring in the new ones as fast as he could . Times would get better . The rains would come ; the cattlemen have to get out . Other locators , all along the free-land region from Indian Territory to Canada , said the same thing to the new wave of homeseekers driven into the face of drouth and starvation by the economic unrest of the East . The upper Niobrara country , the hard-land region of deep , black soil and fine crops when the rains still came , tolled them like green corn a hungry cow . But now the homeseekers found the better land gone , mostly in the hands of Eastern receiverships , the whole tablelandregion brown and dead , and so they sifted southward across the loose-bottomed Niobrara into the cattleman range , the sandhills that soaked up every drop of moisture , feeding thousands of little fresh-water lakes and the hundreds of streams that seeped from the far fringes of the region like rivulets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass still grew belly-deep when all the rest of the Great Plains baked and burned . And hard upon the settlers came the starving herds of foreigncattle from as far away as the Powder River and the Cimarron , stock the owners hoped to feed over until prices came back . The cattlemen of the hills oiled up their revolvers , strapped Winchester boots to their saddles , put snake killers on the payroll , and strung barbed wire around the free land they claimed as range . Every few days high-piledp167loads of post and wire creaked through the Slogum yard . And each black spool meant range that would have to be fought for if it were ever taken over at all . And sometimes Gulla went to her map and looked at the faint red outline of her earlier ambition . Once she picked up the eraser , dark-edged , unused . She let it drop to the end of its string and swing there , like a dying pendulum . At the first signs of Slogum weakening , a road house started up on the deserted Bullard place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one freight road to draw from , but with the additional attraction of an unsolved murder to point out to strangers ,  --  and with dancing and whiskey and women ,  --  they seemed to be doing well enough . Twice Hab rode down that way and , seeing the land-office business going , came back suggesting a little more gayety on Saturday nights at Slogum House . Gulla turned from her preoccupation with her problems . " Now ? " she asked , and he went away . . No , better not now . Cash rode over to the Willow too , quite often . And when he returned he stalked unsteadily and noisily to the crow 's nest and Butch . Even the extra girls were getting unruly , wanting to come into the parlor in the evenings , to mix with the men , as in the Willow . Gulla looked out upon them from her flat , grayish face . They had it fine and easy here , did n't they ? Nothing to do all day but dabble out their few things in their washroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Forenoons , when nobody was around , they could sit out on the unfinished west side in the cool shade , or even go for a walk . Mostly they just laid around , sleeping or reading old paper-backed novels , if they could read  --  or talking , tellingstories no lady had ever heard . And in nice tasty rooms , too , not boxes like so many places had . And did n't she let them keep any presents the men gave them , even a little whiskey now and then , if they did n't get coarse and loud  --  and as much of their money as Dolly ? They could save most of it , too , because all they needed was a couple of wrappers and a pair of fussy slippers , and even those things did n't get much wear . Yet here they were , saying they wanted to sit in the parlor . In her parlor  --  where the pictures of the Slogum sisters of Ohio hung , with their smooth hair and their lady hands ? Not common street hustlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Willow . In a week they came dragging back , bouncing along on the running gears of a freighter 's wagon . " Was n't there no parlor for you to sit in ? " Gulla asked them as she held the door against their faces . They could kiss her backside , the whores . She had two other girls coming from Dolly 's , and a little waiting would only make the customers keener . What worried Gulla more , when she could think of it at all , was that neither Cellie nor Annette was doing very well ; their hearts did n't seem to be in the work any more . Annette got a quarter of land from the mayor of Fairhope , sandhill land he took in on some deal , but he was a generous , even a reasonable man ; there should have been a lot more from him . Deemer of the Bar UY she lost entirely . Cellie did n't do that much . Most of the time the girls just loafed around the house , Annette mooning like a lovesick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag with Cash and Butch , or reading in her room : cheap , common novels like those the upstairs girls brought in  --  probably something like Laura Jean Libbey 's Was She Sweetheart or Wife ? , with the paper back long gone , or maybe The Girl He Forsook . She spent a lot of time looking at new corsets in the catalogues because Butch had told her she was beefy in the behind , not trim like her sisters . Annette seldom left the house alone any more , except in the brightest light of day when there were men around , men withP169played-out teams or broken-down wagons to repair at the blacksmith shop . And even then sometimes Butch sneaked out through the hall and watched his chance to get to the barn and his horse . Usually , on those days , the girl came galloping back , her hair down and her hairpins scattered , her horse winded . Once she sent the convalescing Ward back for the switch she lost in Cedar Canyon , a switch of her own fine auburn hair . Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver she bought in Hot Springs the day she came home . She did n't know just why she got it , except that she was afraid they were letting Ward die . Annette took the gun , slipping it into the front of her shirtwaist . " Things is a gon na pop over to the Slogums ' one a these days , " Hank Short told his fellows as they pulled away into the first teeming sunlight of an early September day with two loads of long , pitchy logs from Pine Ridge for calf sheds , and more black spools of wire . The morning air was still , with the tense stillness of a comingstorm , when Ward rode out to look after the stock , the old twelve-gauge shotgun across his saddle for a mess of plump young grouse for Libby . In the middle of the forenoon the yearling colts came running up from Spring Slough , nipping each other playfully , manes flying , tails erect , stopping with forefeet braced hard against the yard fence of Slogum House , their dusty sides heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-logy bullsnake out of the henhouse to hang over the fence , tail writhing , gray-white belly up , to bring rain . Not that anybody at Slogum House particularly wanted it this late , to spoil the fall pasture and any down hay , not even to soak the cow chips for the settlers , but because one always hung a snake up for rain . At the door of the chicken coop Dodie looked back over his shoulder toward Slogum House where a man with long greasy hair lived , a man who once struck him across the face because he would n't say whichP170way Gulla and Annette went , a man who would shoot flying white pigeons from the sky . Around noon a low fan of cloud spread out of the northwest with midsummer swiftness . After dinner Dodie went out to oil the range mills this quiet day and Hab rode toward the Cedar Creek line fence that Gulla said was giving so much trouble , with the cows getting through into mudholes . If Dodie did n't keep a close eye on them and snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after Hab left , Cash came stomping down the stairs from the crow 's nest and then let his sorrel stand fighting fallhungryflies at the corral gate for over an hour while he went back to Butch . When the yard was empty of stoppers and Cellie had swung out of the yard in a hired buggy with Os Puddley , Libby got her plumming pail and a sack and , with Ward 's twenty-two to kill any rattlesnakes she might see , she rode up over the hogbackand away towards the thickets of the upper Willow , where the plums were dropping , heavy and sweet , for the busy wasps . And soon afterward Annette came out in her new divided twill skirt , tawny as an antelope , and , looking back at the rising cloud , headed her black horse away toward lower Spring Branch Canyon , where the little stream now called Rene Creek emptied and the fall asters blued a stony slope . Hard behind her rode Cash , but he took the Cedar Creek trail , the way Hab had gone . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were merely a wool sack of potatoes in his way . There was only one horse left , an unbranded , half-wild three-year-old bay in the back shed . With his throw rope looped free at the horn of his saddle , his revolverpounding against his heavy thigh , Butch held the young horse to a little rearing and crow-hopping and then started on a run down the trail after Annette , the dust hanging low in the quiet air . P171From upstairs Gulla saw him go as a dozen times before ; saw , too , the dark clouds of the late summer storm lowering black and full of thunder , and two teams and a horsebacker hurrying towards the Willow across Oxbow Flat where her fence had stood unbroken until only a few weeks ago , stood tight and strong , and turned all corners through her own yard . Not long after Butch rode away there was a muffled shot somewhere , as though a hunter had raised a single prairie chicken or a settler fired at a hawk over his pullets . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shotgun , and another . Then the dead air settled again , the black roll of clouds moved faster out of the northwest , sweeping up a low wall of yellow dust across Sundance Table . And up the trail came Annette , riding hard , turning to look back , and whippingher quirt to both sides . In the yard she stopped her horse , black sides lathered and quivering , threw the reins to the ground , and , with the little revolver hanging from her hand , ran to her room . While the girl was trying to close the steel bar , Gulla pushed the door open and rolled up the shade so there was no hiding at all from her prying little eyes . " Stop that bawling , " the mother commanded , taking the revolver from the loose , white fingers and pushing the girl down on the bed . Annette choked back her sobs and crawled away across the spread , to cower at the wall . Ignoring her retreat , Gulla broke the gun , took out the one empty shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , " she scolded , as though there were no revolver at all , no shell smelling of spent black powder in her palm . " Going on like this , over nothing  --  spoiling your pretty eyes . " Slowly the girl came to the edge of the bed , brushed her hair from her face , and straightened her riding skirt over her knees , much as a chastised child might . " He almost got me , " she tried to explain . But the woman standing before her gave no acknowledgment and so the daughter was driven on . " The rope was going right over me  --  and  --  I shot at him  --  93The woman curled her thin gray lip . " You did n't kill him . " " Oh , no  --  " the girl denied , quickly . " But I tried to , " she cried , burying her face in the embroidered sham of the pillow . Gulla looked down upon her and , deciding she knew no more , pulled the crisp white square away from under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed . Taking the revolver to Libby 's room , she laid it and the empty shell on the dresser . Then she climbed to the crow 's nest where not a tumbleweed could move across the bare plain without her seeing . But there was nothing at all except two more freight wagons taking the short cut to the new road house in the Willow , and old Moll Barheart 's white mules swinging off toward the Niobrara . By the time the thunder had moved up the sky most of the Slogums were home , riding in with something of the excitement of the colts in the morning . Hab came in early , standing in his stirrups as he used to , palms crossed on the saddlehorn , orange silk flying from his throat , up the Cedar Creek road . A quarter of a mile behind him came Cash , in the short lope of the range country , cutting down the distance between him and his brother . When he saw Annette 's horse , loose in the yard , he hurried to the crow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the holes overlooking lower Spring Branch trail , empty as the first wind that came sweepingover Oxbow ahead of the storm . Whistling a little , Ward hurried in from Cedar Creek , with his spade and the old shotgun , but with no coyote scalps to add to the row he had tacked on the grainery wall , and no grouse for his sister . Dropping his tools , he called for Dodie , and when there was no answer he galloped out for the milk cows before the storm.  |p173When  Libby came in , Gulla met her at the door . " No luck , " the girl said , shaking an empty pail . The rifle , unloaded in the yard , she put back on the pegs in the mother 's room . " Did n't even see a snake , and somebody beat me to the plums , " she added as she dumped the cartridgesfrom her pocket and went out to see about supper for the two teams and the Diamond B punchers riding up fast as the lightning began to snap along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the first drops of rain fell , heavy and cold , in the dust . When Gulla rang the supper bell Dodie came shivering into the kitchen , a gunny sack for a hood over his head and shoulders , waiting until the freighters were done to wash the mill grease from his thick , clumsy hands . At the second bell Annetteslipped into her place at the Slogum table , pale , with fresh powder around her eyes . Behind her Hab was followedclose by Cash from the empty crow 's nest . While the rain splattered slow against the windows , the Slogums , all but Ruedy , sat around a warm , comfortable meal of fresh bullheads , endive salad , beans , baked potatoes , and plum pie . Several times Cash looked all along the table under his thick lids , and at every step in the hall he stopped his knife , waiting . But always it was only another cold and hungry trailer headed for the freighters ' table . And after the meal Gulla stopped in the flood of yellow light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told Libby , when Babbie 's broadening back was gone toward the dishes of the dining room . The daughter , already putting the food away , nodded her understanding that Butch was still out and made no sign that she had seen the empty cartridge on her dresser or that she knew anything about the revolver at all . After supper she played and Ward sang too , now that his voice was settling  --  " Swanee River " and " My Old Kentucky Home , " with " Christine LeRoy " for Annette , plaintive and sad as she sang :  --  eh " My broken heart only is ' waiting A resting place under the snow . " Then Hab , for the first time in weeks , took up a cowboy song or two , encouraging the punchers on their heels along the wall to join in . Just before the rain began to stream down the windows Cellie came running in alone , gay and excited with the storm , holding a fringed dust robe over her hat and shoulders . And the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost unfamiliar shuffle of Ruedy 's feet , very slow and heavy to-night , came to them from the kitchen . Libby smiled , excused herself , and went to put out supper for her father . But he only pushed it all from him , and barely touched his coffee , mostly just sitting with his head on his arm . Finally he got up and started away into the lashing storm in spite of all Libby could do . So she ran after him with a yellow slicker from the porch , throwing it about him . From the triangle of darkness it made for him in the sheet lightning , he mumbled something , his voice so low and strange she had to ask him what he said . " Butch slit the throat of the little antelope . " At this one more thing against old Tit-Ear the blood rose in Libby 's ears , drowning out the storm and the violet of the fall lightning . But before she could speak against the man , Ruedy was plodding away into the rain , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the girl went slowly back into the house , to wipe her streaming hair in a towel and to shiver off to bed . By ten o'clock the wind and thunder were dying down , moving sullenly away toward the horizon . Gulla stayed in her rocker just inside her room , but the outside door never opened all the night . And the morning brought a golden sun to shine on a thin white frost and an empty crow 's nest.  |p175ALL  the long day after Butch rode out of the Slogum yard the windmill wheel stood motionless in the still air that was warm and sweet as a golden muskmelon in the September sun . For hours two eagles hung against the clear washed blue of the sky over lower Spring Branch Canyon , joined , now and then , by the slow circling of a turkey buzzard . Probably a cow or a calf dead and bloating somewhere along the range trail worn deep and loose by the feet of the starvingforeign stock this summer  --  probably a cow or a calf dead for weeks and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last freighter was gone from Oxbow Flat , the Slogum place was busy as a warm windowpane of late flies . From the kitchen , where Babbie helped Libby with the catsup and the corn relish , a fragrance of spice and hot vinegar spread into the quiet air of the yard , to mingle with the pungent smoke from the blacksmith shop . Hab , with Dodie to cut the strap iron with a cold chisel and to pump the forge fire to a roaring , was making two new brandingirons , a big and a small one , bob-handled , but with couplingsfor long extensions . Hab was always proud of his combination of the letters  --  pretty handy brand to run over simpler ones or any careless burnings . Advertised as it was on the brand page of the Dumur Duster in eight positions on the animal to indicate pretended individual ownership among the Slogums , the iron could legally be used on thep176leg , hip , ribs , or shoulder , on the left side or the right . Hab spit on the glowing iron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought the metal with vise and anvil and forge he watched Dodie , recalling that old Butch had struck the humpback in the face with his quirt that time Gulla was off chasing after Ward , and shot his damned white pigeons out of the sky just a few days ago . But there was no telling what Dodie knew or suspected . He was untalking , and deep as the black mud between the bunch bogs of Cedar Creek . In the cool duskiness of her room Gulla was writing Fanny a long-delayed letter , saying she had been very , very busy , and not too well . But now she was strong again , and adding a little extra to the check this month , to buy a present . Something refined and appropriate for a young lady . Several times during the painstaking task the mother went upstairs to look out over the empty trail leading toward lower Spring Branch Canyon , down upon the activities of the yard below her , and then over Oxbow Flat to Ward . He was out there resetting the posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruedy 's underwear on the fence across the old trail that had been open as the wind for weeks . He must be working fast , for already a team was turned from the Willow Creek road toward Slogum House . And from the breaks of lower Spring Branch another buzzard rose toward the soaring eagles black against the sky . All the warm , still day the busy hum of Slogum House went on , with many little errands out into the bright openness of the yard ; Libby after something in the cellar ; Hab running with the irons cherry-red to see how the new sizes would look on the shed wall , already well scorched with the brand of Slogum House . Even Dodie stuck his head out of the shop at the least squawk of a chicken , while in the corralp177Cash was working the kinks from the coil-stiffened throw ropes and watching the southwest too , guardedly , under the brim of his dusty hat . So the day passed , and long before anyone dared ride away before the eyes of all the place and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone from the canyon of lower Spring Branch and the eagles to their far hunting . From the day Butch rode down the trail , Slogum House settled back to the calm of familiar work , like a plough mare returning to her furrow after a long bewilderment of saddleand spur . But underneath , nothing could ever be quite what it was before Old Tit-Ear came with his secret whistle in the night and then rode away so openly in the full light of day . Although no one mentioned him , it was hard to believe that he deliberately turned his back on the easy , secure , peanut-crunching existence of the last few months , the first security he must have known since he , in true Haber fashion , dragged a girl into the bushes and horrified her so she told her father . With Slogum House and all the influence Gulla had built up around it at the ends of his thick fingers ,  --  protection from the sheriff , money , power , and the compensationof Annette 's beauty for his own deficiencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on a horse and lope away on his own hook and not return by feeding time . Not unless he had some scheme , maybe some partner of his own kind to ride beside him on his return to Slogum House . So if Butch did n't return eventually it must be because he was dead . That meant that somewhere in the Slogum outfit there was a dangerous one , one with the courage and skill to outwit a killer and to cover his tracks well . Of the three shots that afternoon , presumably only Gulla ,  | Annette , and Libby knew who fired even one , the one from the revolver Annette carried . But with all the Slogums out except Gulla , the trigger finger might have been anyone 's , even Dodie 's on a borrowed gun . But no Slogum made talk of the shooting . The string of warm September days increased like drops of pitch on a new pine board and the wasps took over the crow 's nest . But down in the Slogum halls even heavyfootedlittle Babbie was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows , the polite words they had for each other . She knew that it was still about that man with the long hair , although there were no peanut shells underfoot any more , or boot stompings overhead . Of them all only Dodie did n't seem to watch every move of the rest , or stand behind some wall or building looking out upon any horsebacker coming . And even Dodie seemed different , jolly-like , making funny half-humming noises with his mouth while he did little extra things for Babbie , good and nice to her like always , but with a white pigeon feather stuck into the band of his sweaty old hat lately . As the weeks went by any unusual noise or step still brought up every Slogum eye , vigilant as a new-calved longhornsmelling a dog , none willing to suggest that the return of Butch Haber seemed less inevitable than the wind or the climbing sun of morning . Cash was the last to reconcile himself to the things of Slogum House as they were before the coming of Tit-Ear , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , like in the old days , a mammoth figure before the son 's uncertain eyes . A long time she stood so , while he tried to make a talking to hide the whiskey on his breath , a covering for his escape , but the boy 's poor jokes left only his own laughing , silly and alone in the silence of the house . And at last his courage broke , and stumbling back from the mother , he whispered ,  | " By God  --  by God , I believe you done it , you had Butch killed  --  " Then , made doubly afraid by the stupidity of his tongue , he ducked past Gulla and up the stairs , slamming the door behind him , bracing his shoulder against it . Only when there was no pursuit did he wipe the cold drops of water from his face . Back in her room , Gulla planned the end of the Willow Creek road house . With Annette once more in the buggy of Tad Green , the place unlicensed , and still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . The sister of Tex got fifty dollars for the relinquishment , Dodie filed on the place , and Gulla dumped the hog-ranch outfit into the road , moving the lumber of the shacky buildings to Slogum House . There Libby discovered bedbugs in the cracked boards and had Dodie chop up the worst of them for brandingfuel and pile the rest in a hollow square around an ant pile , open to the sun and wind . I-Iank Short , stopping at Slogum House again , talked a little sadly of the departed place in the Willow . Gulla heard him , and rocked complacently under the picture of Frances Willard . It was another victory for the workers of the Lord , she told them all . In the meantime it was not too late to cut a little hay , frosted , but better stacked or even just bunched up than buried standing under crusted snow . With the fall hauling to be done , most of the work with the spring calves and all the culling of the stock and the shipping , Gulla sent Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-good hands cheap . He discovered that in hard times there is more power in the checkbook than in writ or rifle , that five dollars a month and found can be big money to a man who dried out three years hand-running . And because the five dollars might keep a man 's family from starving , help himp180wait out one more spring , Gulla was careful that the hands came from far away , far beyond the faint red line of her ambition . Hab , a good cowman , managed the stock . In three weeks much of the summer and fall work had been thrown together like a crazy quilt . But not the lost prestige of Slogum House . Even watery-eyed old Tom Sissel laughed openly over his meat at Gulla , and she let it pass . And as the fall work progressed Gulla saw how well little Dodie , with the help of the strengthening Ward , had kept the place going while the men of Slogum House skulked within its gray walls . The two had even ploughed all the fireguards , Dodie holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soapweeds while Ward drove the six-horse team . They cut the guards extra wide around the winter pasture and the hay flats , for the prairie was dry and the enemies plentiful . So when Gulla made out a fall order for overshoes and bolts of unbleached muslin sheeting for Slogum House , she ordered a saddle of bright stamped leather for Ward , with a stout fork and plenty of good strings , and for Dodie a corduroy suit  --  three dollars , but durable . With the work going well , even the west side of the second story boarded up with the lumber of Pastor tug 's little church , Hab and Cash began to ride away into the night again . The pens in lower Spring Slough  --  wire strung inconspicuouslythrough the dense , graying slumps of willows  --  were once more steaming with fresh manure in the frost of the mornings . And once more there was fresh fried beef for the freighters ' table and tenderloin for the guests of the Slogum sisters . To Libby the warm busy days of fall passed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took Dodie and Babbie with her to the Niobrara below the Ricker place for buffalo berries , showing them how to pound the thornyp181branches with sticks , raining the close-clustering little orange berries into an umbrella , clean-lined with sugar sacking . While the two filled their tubs , Libby picked a wash boiler of late grapes , frost-sweetened , for jam . When her teeth were blue from the eating and her lips burned , she buttoned her denim jumper and crawled up on a flock of mallards along a sandbar in the river . At the boom of the twelve-bore against the bluffs , Dodie came loping through the slough grass to gather up the mess of ducks . But already Libby had lost interest in her hunting and was walking ankle-deep in the leaves of the bare cottonwoods and looking up the graying canyon toward the Ricker place , where her black torn was killed , and beyond to the homestead of Leo Platt hidden by the bluffs and the bend of the river . And on moonlit nights , when the washing and cleaning work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out across the silvery sheen of Oxbow Flat , the curly nigger wool brittle and dry under the little feet of the field mice that scurried away before her . Sometimes she thought of the young Fanny as she walked , Fanny with hair silky as milkweed , and safely away from Slogum House , with girls and girl things all about her . In the evenings there would be soft light in the music room and someone , perhaps the slim Fanny from Oxbow with a blue ribbon sash , playing at the low piano . Often she thought , too , of the Slogums of Ohio , the two sisters with their lady hands that Gulla hated so , and their ailing father . She knew how it was with them from little clippings she saw at Ruedy 's : William Penn Slogum , accompanied by his daughters , the Misses Annette and Marcella , going south . William Penn Slogum improving from long illness . And there was the Grossmutter , living alone with the old cook and gardener on the place cleared by the help of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's childhood.  | Yet in all the years she had never written a word to the youth who disobeyed her one command to return . Must it always be so , be the big , raw-boned cows hooking the finer , gentler stock from the feed , driving them away , to stand looking  --  always the Habers who took what they wanted , leaving the hands of the Ruedys , the Renes , and even the Bullards , empty ? And as Libby considered these things shreds of pale fog rose from the invisible canyon of the Niobrara to hang low over the bluffs like skeins of white wool . And on Oxbow Flat the trails lay in dark , uneven bands of velvet shadow under the autumn moon , the soft dust in the ruts the ashes of forgotten wheels , and reluctant hoofs moving in the patternset by rope and leather and spur . Deserted by Cash , Cellie took to running into her sister 's room much as she used to . Annette was gay once more , and reckless , and Cellie , with the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met these high spirits with plump gigglings and plans for fall picnics and outings with such of their admirers as remained  --  Tad Green , Os Puddley , and a race-horse man or two from up the line . The twins were taking a new interest in clothes , too , and once more they came home with bundles to be carried to Gulla with pride and exclamations : cashmeres soft to the touch , plaid taffetas to be held over their bosoms for her approval . Once they whirled in from Dumur , each with her hands primly together in her new muff , little larger than Ruedy 's muskmelons , but soft and dark to match the fur piece around her neck . Race-horse men , sports . " You ought to get a little go to you , " Cellie told Libby , laughing gayly at the absurdity of her suggestion as the elder sister cut and pinned and basted the new silk dresses that were rustling and stiff as sandpaper . " Maybe you could get that feller from down on the river yet  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked away in their bosoms , to try before their marbletoppedbureaus , and wondering if they dared come out , remembering that Gulla had sent Delline , one of the secondfloorgirls , back up to wash her face when she came to the freighters ' table with her cheeks fever-red . And it was not important that Delline be a lady . But they were discreet , and Gulla had other things on her mind . Early in October Leo Platt once more rode openly into the Slogum yard . Dismounting , he tied his horse to the hitch rail and rapped on the screen door of the porch with his brown knuckles . From the kitchen Libby saw him waiting , standing tall in his corduroy trousers stuffed into his boots , with a badge on his open leather coat  --  no gun , only the bright deputy sheriff 's badge . As the girl ran her hand over her hair and smoothed her apron she wondered at this errand that brought the locator to Slogum House . Probably something Tad Green dared not serve himself and yet could not ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying boodling and corruption all summer . When Platt knocked again she finally went out upon the porch , the man touching the bleached brim of his hat as she came , his eyes changingfrom storm gray in swift warmth . But the words he made spoke nothing at all to the girl . " I have warrants , " he was saying , " for a man who calls himself Butch Braley and for Hab and Cash Slogum . " The flush that had swept up the throat of the girl receded , leaving her suddenly empty and cold . Almost naturallyshe reached a hand out to the door casing , as though this were to be a long , friendly talk . " Butch Braley  --  ? " she asked , vaguely . " Yes , and for Hab and Cash . "  | She nodded slowly , and without asking the man into this house she went away , to the room where her mother lay dozingagainst a busy night . After a while Gulla was at the inner screen door , her corset on , the curling tins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out upon the man from the protection of her hall . " You want a Butch Braley  --  " " Yes , and Haber and Cash Slogum , " Platt repeated for her , asking no notice of his badge . Hooking the screen door against the locator , the woman of Slogum House considered him under her fleshy lids as though to force an explanation from him as she did from her sons . But he volunteered nothing to break the silence and so she finally had to ask : " Why do you want them ? " " For the murder of Tex Bullard . " " Hm-m-m , " she acknowledged , because a little surpriseseemed good , and pulling at her lower lip that was no grayer than always . Finally she went away too , much as Libby had , and plodded upstairs . From Ward 's room she looked down upon the man as he waited , his horse switching a lazy tail at the last of the fall-hungry flies . Leo Platt was down there alone , unarmed , unprotected . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no other living thing anywhere , no eyewitness except of Slogum House if anything happened to him  --  of Slogum House , including Libby . So she went to the room of her sons . Hab was up at her first step , completely awake . " Leo Platt ' s down there , wanting you for Bullard . " Cash , still boyishly half asleep , was already plunging his feet into his boots . " Down where ? " he asked , in a scared whisper . " Who ' s he got with him  --  " running to the window to see for himself under the blind , his hand on the butt of his gun.  |p185But  Gulla 's thick fingers were on her son 's shoulder . " Do n't be a fool . He ' s looking for Butch , too , and there ' s no telling who he ' s got watching or what ' s broke loose  --  anyhow , it ' d only make things hotter for you . " " I ' 11 get the bastard this time ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ' 11 get him  --  " But Hab was breaking his gun carefully . Whirling the filled magazine , he dropped it back into his holster and pulled his hat to his eyes . Once or twice he looked cautiously at his mother , but if she knew what was behind this she gave him no sign . " Listen , you  --  hold yourself together . All you got ta do is stick to the truth . You did n't touch Tex Bullard , " the mother coached . Cash was in the doorway , gray under his tan . " You mean you ' re going to let him take us ? " " Yes , " she said , speaking over a curling lip to him . " Yes  --  you scairt Slogum bastard . Of course I ' m going to let him take you  --  and quietly , under protest , but quietly . " Holding back her long calico skirt , she went down the stairs , the sons following . Their hands on their guns , they came out upon the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark in their black sateen shirts , with no neighborly greeting at all for the man before them . Leo Platt pulled out a long envelope , looked into it , handed the Slogum sons each a paper through the screen door , and put the rest back into his vest . " I figger Butch is n't here , " he commented . The eyes of the Slogums lifted , swift and dangerous , from the white papers in their hands , but they asked no basis for the deputy 's assumption and left the reply to Gulla . " No , there ai n't nobody here by that name . " " Yes  --  well , let ' s be riding . And you better leave your guns with your mother . Tough characters sometimes travel these here trails into the hills . "  | At this first attempt at disarming , the Slogum sons backed , their palms on the worn butts at their sides . But Gulla held out her pudgy hands and so they gave up their guns , Hab very slowly , but too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed with the brothers for their saddle horses , and then together they rode out of the yard , the locator between the sons of Slogum House . From behind the parlor curtain Libby saw them cross the fall dun of Oxbow Flat in the loose-reined little lope of the range country , like three friends on the trail . And when they were gone she found the old twelve-gauge shotgun still in her hand , the hammer cocked . Gulla was wasting no time looking after her sons and the man who took them away . Her plans already made , she was in Annette 's room giving orders . " Clothes enough to stay a week , a month if you have to  --  " she was saying . OutsideDodie hurried down to Spring Slough for the buggy team . By noon those left at Slogum House knew that Blackie Daw had confessed . It was Collie who got the story from Dumur , through the poor but useful Os Puddley . " That Blackie bum ! And after we kept him hid out in the crow 's nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took Cellie away to her room . " I wonder who ' s paying him , " the woman who was Regula Haber pondered as she scribbled down the things to be done while she was away at Dumur . Then she got into the buggy and drove to town alone . It was after dark when she tied her horses behind Tad Green 's house and tapped on the back door . Two days later the Dumur Duster came . Under the blackest type heading the paper had was the story of RaymondMaxon , alias Blackie Daw , as told to the editor :  --   |p187Along  the last of May or first of June , I ca n't figger the exact date because I was hiding out and lost count , the two Slogum boys hired me to help get rid of a fellow down east of their place , on a little creek . They took me and the man they called Butch and some white-haired kid called Dun over to the bluffs near the man 's place pretty early and showed us the lay of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no blood . Make it look like he ' d just left and had n't come back . Then the two Slogums rode away , saying they ' d be back after the job was done . It was lightning and raining a little and Dun was bellyaching about it , but nobody else sayingmuch , just riding along , me with a spade across my saddle . We stopped in a bunch of willows down by the creek and this Butch , a fellow with long hair and a mouth like a rat trap , told me to go on ahead to where we could see a lighted window . I goes and it was a oneroomsod house with no plastering , and there was two men on the floor , talking over a map they ' d spread out like . The one that acted like he lived there got up a couple times , once to get a pencil and once to get a roll of bluish-like maps that I think they called government plats while they was spreading them out . So I sneaks back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dun kid was nervous and wanting to go and do the job by plugging thorn both through the window , swearing a lot , calling me and Butch g  --  dew-lapped lady fingers . But this Butch fellow made him wait . A long time after that one of the men rode away from the shack , the other one yelling good-night to him from the door . Then this Dun kid gets in the road and goes over that way , walking the last piece . He was to say his horse played out on him and he turned him loose in the meadow and was just coming up to find out where he was at . Riding in from Rawlings way and headed for the Diamond B. That ' d sound good to Bullard , who used to haul for that optfit . The kid had a bottle on him to help make things slicker . Then he was to get Bullard to talking and away from his gun . While Dun was getting over there , Butch took me down to the lane where this fellow 's horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the creek . First Butch ' d tried to get that Dun kid to do the spade work but he would n't . He ' d a weak hack , he said , laughing like a Cheyenne chippie . So I dug a long hole as good as I could by the lightning , twice the length of the spade handle and deep enough , I calculated . In about half an hour Dun and Butch come carrying a man in a blanket and sets him down on the bank while the hole ' s dug deeper to suit the Butch fellow , and the kid gripes a lot , because it 's raining more and his slicker ' s still on the saddle . So they dumps the man in and I covers him up , and we gets the horses out , rides back and forth a lot , and it raining harder . Then in a big shot of lightning , one of them sees the blanket they ' d carried Bullard down in , and so they had me dig a trench off a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy digging and buried it too . Then the three of us gets back on our horses and rides down the creek a ways where we left the Slogums and they give us a hundred dollars apiece and the horses we ' re on and tells us to separate and git for the border , which we did . The story was signed RAYMOND MAXON ( Blackie Daw ) . Another paragraph was tacked to the story , saying that the man Maxon knew as Butch he identified as the Butch Braley wanted for shooting a man in a mail robbery up in Wyoming . He could n't find anybody that looked like the white-haired kid Dun on the reward notices tacked up in the post office.  |p189Gulla  took Cellie and Annette to the trial , all three in new fall outfits with small hats and fashionable dotted veils pulled close under their chins with velvet bands . Libby watched Gulla swing the spring wagon around by way of Ruedy 's place . He was to make a show of family solidarity and respectabilityfor these women of Slogum House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumpness of Cellie , and the willowy , auburn-haired , fragile beauty of Annette . They would sit on the front row , Ruedy in outmodedand shabby black that Gulla bought for him for her mother 's funeral twelve years ago . His kindly gray eyes would be worried and unhappy , his fine , long , hoe-crooked fingers restless on his thin knees . Every day gossip of the proceedings reached Slogum House . There was a story , too , that someone passed Hab and Cash Slogum riding north of town in the night with what looked like a spade but must have been a rifle across the saddle . When word got around Dumur about it , the next morning , the sheriff opened the jail and showed the Slogums still there . Thursday Ward came running in with the Dumur Duster . Libby sent Babbie to the cellar on an errand , telling her not to hurry , and , sitting on the kitchen table , they held the paper between them and read the story . ACTS LIKE CRAZY MANMaxon Tells of the Murder of TexBullard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ContradictingHimself and Disputing Council  --  MakesBreak for Open CountryRaymond Maxon , alias Blackie Daw , who confessed to- a part in the murder of Tex Bullard down on Willow Creek last June , acted like an insane man while on the witnessstand this afternoon . He contradictedp190his confession and his own testimony , objectedto question by the prosecution , disputedcounsel for defense , and was repeatedlycalled down by the court . During his examination he asked for and was granted permission to retire out back a few minutes . He broke away from the sheriff accompanying him and for a time refused to return to the courtroom , saying he was afraid he ' d be shot in the box . He was finally prevailed upon to return and resumehis testimony . Leo Platt , settler on the Niobrara , was the first witness called . He gave his reason for inquiring so closely into the disappearance of Bullard because he was a friend of his and knew that he had made enemies with his locating . Platt , it will be recalled , was at one time apprehended for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to the jury substantially as in his confession , but when he was asked to identify the two men who paid him he went to pieces , began to sweat , and shook like the ague . " There they sit , the two Slogum boys , but they ' 11 kill me , " he finally said , stammering so the judge asked him to repeat . At this point the witness asked to be excused , and ran away across the alley with the sheriff after him and refusing to come back until Leo Platt went out and quieted him down . Upon Maxon 's return to the courtroom he was still so nervous he could hardly proceed . The objections of the counsel angered him and he talked back until the court told him not to do so , and not to tell the prosecution the questions that should be asked . The witness contradicted himself and denied statements he had made in direct examination . While he said he had been at Slogum House for six weeks , he estimatedp191the family at a mother , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning Haber Slogum took the stand and swore that if the man Maxon was ever at Slogum House it was in passing through , for a meal or overnight , as hundredsdid each year . He did not recall anyone named Butch Braley or Dun . The testimony of Cash Slogum agreed substantiallywith that of Haber Slogum . Court adjourned . As Libby read she saw again the frightened man in the crow 's nest ; his gun upon her every time she brought his tray for six whole weeks , like a rabbit she found in the corner of the hog pen one cold winter day , scared so he missed the only hole big enough to let him out where corn had tolled him in . Then she remembered that Gulla took the sheriff 's coat up to torture the man in the crow 's nest , she herself making him think that Pastor Zug and his armed men had come for him that spring day so long ago . Poor devil , poor , poor devil , to fall into the hands of the women of Slogum House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard his question : " You do n't s'pose that they ' 11 get them for it ? " mentioning no names in Slogum House , even to this sister . Arranging the pages evenly , Libby gave the anxious boy a smile and a shake of her head as she folded the paper and put it in the cross-lath rack that hung on the wall near the stove , for fire lighting . " Time for the cows , " she announced , pushing the boy , as tall by now as she , toward the door . When Ward was gone Libby carried the paper to her room and put it under her books in the bottom dresser drawer . But she could n't put from her mind the courtroom at Dumur as it must be : Gulla on the front row , laced into a new black cashmere with white ruching at the neck and cuffs , her dark little eyes alert under their thick lids ; the twinsp192beside her elegant in their high collars and soft curls at their temples  --  Annette , with her Rene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit with Bullard in the dark of spring nights . And beside them poor Ruedy , his shamed eyes always on the callusesof his hands . Behind Gulla and her daughters every seat would be packed , with standing rows of sunburnt men in patched and fringing overalls along the wall . Among them would be the many who had cause to hate Slogum House , many who had lost something to the Slogums , something they had worked for . There must be names she had never heard , as the owner of the organ she played in the evenings , and some she would know : poor Bill Masterson , who had gone away without his colt ; all those of the school on Cedar Flats ; Muhler , whose horse Ward shot ; Pastor Zug and his congregation , who had lost the new church that was built with dollars big as cartwheels ; Mike Sass , whose colts Bullard had seen stolen . Of course Leo Platt would be there , and Tad Green 's wife , pretending not to see the handsome Annette in her fine clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That much at least was spared the father , sitting there before all those people with no shield in all the world for the hurt in his eyes , the bewilderment and the sorrow she saw in him the night he said to her , " Ach , Liebchen , Liebchen , what have I then done to my children ? " During the next day several horsebackers brought news of the trial to Slogum House . That Maxon seemed to be crazy  --  anxious to have everybody believe that he really helped bury Bullard . He tried to get the whole court and everybodyto go down to the Willow with him to find the man . When the sheriff laughed and told him that the body had been found , that it was all over the country , in all the papers , he would n't believe it . When they told him that any loony in the fool house could have made up his story he went off in ap193corner of his cell and sat on the floor , mad-like . But pretty soon he was back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney . And along sometime after noon three deputiesand Maxon drove down to the Willow , with him carrying the shovel again , between his knees this time . The next morning the prosecution brought in a box containingthe remains of a blue Indian blanket , with the border of beads still intact . It was identified by Leo Platt as belonging to Bullard and by Maxon as the one on which Butch Braley and the kid they called Dun carried Bullard 's body , the blanket they forgot and later buried in the loose dry sand under the ledge of sandstone . During the cross-examination Maxon was nervous and stammering , but he stuck to his story like a sandbur to a sheep . He got to yelling at them all when they kept asking him who paid him to make the confession . Nobody paid nothing . He got religion at a camp meeting , had to get right with God . No , he did n't kill the man himself . The Slogum boys ' d tried to get him to do the knocking in the head for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer . Yeh , Hank Short told Libby , it was beginning to look bad for Hab and Cash , with the blanket and all , particularly everybody knowing that Bullard was the main witness in the colt-stealing case against the two of them . Old Bill Billings agreed that Cash was getting pale as a maggotin the jug . Damned pale for an innocent man . He was n't eating right neither , not even the fat hen and dumplingsTad Green 's wife cooked up special for the Slogums , figgering there was no use losing more votes for her husband come November than was necessary . Hab looked a little peaked too . Worrying . But no one could tell what Gulla thought . She took her stylish daughters into the main dining room at the hotel as though they were in town getting new women 's riggings , with Ruedy trailing behind , reluctant as a bucket calf on a rope . The place was soon crowded , but they only heard a lot of palaver about the nice fall weather and the new corded taffetasGulla had ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town  --  not as elegant as satin , but more fitting to the country . Some said that the woman from Slogum House was n't eating well , although she accounted for it by saying , " This ai n't our Libby 's cooking , is it , Father ? " Doing a little public blowing about the feed at her own dump , Hank Short called it . And in the evening all the Slogums went to a church supper and were glad-handing it all around , and pious as a herd of old maids , but there were some who kept their hands to themselves , standing away from the girls like they had the epizootic . The next day , after a lot of satisfaction among the newcomersin the country that this was a good case against the Slogums , Lawyer Beasley demanded that there be some evidenceoffered to show that the man Maxon testified he helped bury was really Tex Bullard . The gentleman getting right with God did n't know the country ; it was dark and raining by his own testimony . Had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What evidence had they to present that he would have known it from any other settler'shomestead ; that the whole thing was n't a malicious plot , the blanket a plant ? If the story was not a complete fabrication , why could n't Maxon identify the man 's effects ? So once more a caravan went out , with shovels and a spring wagon and a string of horsebackers following , to the cemeteryon the hill overlooking the junction of the Niobrara and the Willow . This time Maxon stayed behind and somebodyelse did the spade work . The next day he was asked to describe the clothing of the man he helped bury . He recalled most of it only vaguely , nothing at all about the torn pocket , but clearly describedp195a brass-studded belt and leather cuffs he remembered he would have liked to own . At this confession a sound like a strong , angry wind over a wheat field swept the courtroom , followed by whisperings and boot scrapings and a frightened whitening in the man 's face . But Judge Puddley pounded it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ordered the remains fetched in . Two men carried in an earth-stained pine box , identified as the one used to bury the man found on the Bullard place . At a motion from the judge the lid was taken off and a smell of death spread over the courtroom . Several women stumbled up and fled , handkerchiefs to their mouths , but the rest of the crowd pressed all the closer . Two doctors , an import from Brule and the local man who had refused to bear the responsibility alone , moved forward with the attorneys . From the box a wide brass-studded leather belt was lifted and identifiedby Maxon , and then a matching pair of cuffs . Yes , those were the ones of the man he helped bury . And was the dead man in condition for identification , Beasley inquired formally . The two doctors looked down into the box between them . Their faces changed ; they examined the remains more closely , brought out tufts of curly hair , negro hair . Unmistakably , the dead man was a negro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear of the Slogum outfit , who bought nothing of him anyway and charged him the going rates for his food and second-floor entertainment , told Libby the story of the identification , laughing until he choked and held his slat sides . By jacks , but there was a noise in that courtroom  --  like a bunch of old hens with chicks locked in a coop with a garter snake . " And maybe you think them brothers of yours was n't looking a hull lot easier , ma'am , " he added . But Libby was already on her way to the pantry to preparep196for the homecoming . When she got rid of the peddler she slapped her hat on and went up the hogback toward Ruedy 's shack with a cloth-covered pail . At the crest she looked back upon Slogum House . The last week it had seemed very much like home to her . Not even the things of the courtroom at Dumur could spoil it . She thought of Ruedy as among his flowers , of the locator as he was the day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weapons . No matterwhat mischief they might cook up for him now , she had that . That and the week of home . Towards evening the Slogums , without the twins , clattered into the yard , the horses dust-streaked , the mother very jolly , calling them all to her in a loud voice . Home again , and presents . A new suit for Ward , with pants long enough to cover his skinny shanks and more . Cloth for a fall dress for Libby , hunter 's green , with smoked pearl buttons . Somethingwrapped in tissue paper for Dodie  --  a mouth harp . And news , too . Saturday they were all going to the play at Dumur , Ten Nights in a Bar-Room , a fine , uplifting play with a lesson . Everybody seemed to laugh very easily , even Hab , surprising Dodie so that he stopped under the weight of a sack of sugar to look back . Libby put away the groceries as fast as Dodie carried them in , and by the time the girl got to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plodding homeward afoot , with five good horses eating their heads off at the mangers , and a pot roast of young antelope on , left by a passing hunter . When Slogum House settled into the quiet of sleep at last , Gulla sat down to bring her little black book up to date , looking back over the last week , the money it cost , the hate she saw all around her for Slogum House and its people . The first day they entered the courtroom a noise like a mower sickle in a bumblebees ' nest had to be pounded down by Judge Puddley . And the last afternoon , when the chargesp197against the Slogums were dismissed , the crowd stood , sullenrooted , around the door , the men silent , their faces dark and menacing , not giving way at all . And when the Slogums finally got to the hotel there was a big splatter of tobacco juice on Gulla 's sleeve that she could not remember receiving . She wiped it away quickly with the lace handkerchief from her belt , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asleep , the courthouse had burned to the ground and the next morning papers from the adjoining counties were already in the hotel lobby , smudgy , smelling of wet ink , heavy and black . When the Slogums came out to breakfast , men filled the wide front window around a paper , someone reading aloud , in careful foreigner 's English , a protest against the Maxon trial , calling it a farce , a travesty of justice , conducted like a fall round-up run by tenderfeet and horse thieves . It might be worth the court 's time to investigate the site of the old hog ranch north of Fairhope where a negro was said to have been buried some years ago , where earth had been turned fresh lately . Was the body still there , or had it been removed ? And if so , by whom , and for what purpose ? It might be worth calling a grand jury to discover why the Slogums were turned loose when Maxon was the one being tried . If what the court reviewed was not evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a man of saner mien could legally be pronounced guilty on his confession alone ? And if Dumur County could get no local action it was time the governor took a hand . But perhaps the situation was not entirely hopeless . The burning of the courthouse the very evening after the Slogums were released might safely be interpreted as a gesture of defiance , a weather sign of a rising storm by law-abiding citizens of Dumur County . Let the coming election bring a thorough cleaning out of the courthouse ring , beginning with the sheriff and the county attorney and not forgetting the district judge.  | Yes , it was so , the men told each other as they broke into little knots about the one who had read from the paper . He was tall , with a stooped seriousness , a short blond beard , and a defiant cast in one bright blue eye  --  Pastor Zug from Cedar Flats . The proprietor of the hotel led the Slogums to their breakfast , but there was no escape in the open dining room from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers with the black headline THE SHAME OF DUMUR COUNTY at every plate . Gulla threw her paper on the next table and made ready talk with her sons and daughters , but for Ruedy there was no such refuge . Suddenly it was enough , and he pushed his chair back and , slipping through the side door without his hat , he cut across the street and out upon the flat plain , keeping away from the road , the gathering knots of men along the hotel looking after him . He was eight miles out , with a blue handkerchief tied around his chilling ears , his old black trousers dusty and fraying at the bottoms from the weeds and grass , when the Slogums caught up with him . Gulla was ahead in the spring wagon , driving alone , the two sons trailing , standing in their stirrups , hands on their horns , the drake tails gone from their shoulders , bright new neckerchiefs blowing from their open sheepskin collars . Gulla gave Ruedy his old hat from under the seat , fussing almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mittens , although there were no strangers near to see . But the man only hunched lower on the seat , his head between his hands , until his shoulders were dust-furred and Slogum House came from the blue haze of the far hogback . Yes , it had been a bad , an expensive time , Gulla thought , as she looked through her little black book . The five months of lawing had cost her almost a thousand dollars in actual money for lawyer fees , hotel bills , and pocket linings wherep199they would do the most good  --  not figuring the amounts traded out at Slogum House , the loans that would probably never be paid , or the work that had been half done or not started . In the future the Slogums better take fewer chances , keep out of court , and aim for bigger game than midnight lumber or slicks ; they better increase their land holdings . It was said Deemer over east was stealing a whole county , and yet his name was mentioned with great respect and he did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirty , stinking people looking on , spitting tobacco juice on him or his wife . And there was Pomroy of the Diamond B , right here in Dumur County . He was n't dragged into court ; he went to the legislature . Gulla put the black book away , dropped the string of the desk keys over her head , and stood looking at her map . With a red pencil she drew a larger arc for the projected spread of the Slogum range , reaching southward toward the railroad and as far east , a good thirty miles from the home place each way , taking in most of the Jackson ranch and a good chunk of the Diamond B hay flats . Then there was the long list of delinquent land taxes in the Dumur Duster . She would put five hundred dollars into these , beginning with the Germansof that wapple-eyed Preacher Zug on Cedar Flats , and another five hundred ought to go into the best of the land covered by the sixteen sheriff sales advertised for the next two weeks . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If prices dropped lower she ' d hold them another year . There was grass to the south , and she was the one to take it . Only now that these decisions were made did she permit herself to pull off her corset , modestly , as always , under her gray outing nightgown . As she rolled her bangs into the tins she considered her loose , blood-dusky face on its broad bones . She watched her humorlessmouth stretch a little in recognition . Yes , some dayp200she would be riding in a fine carriage with people looking after as her mother had seen in the cards so long ago . By good management she might get to owning most of Dumur County and tell all that trash that stood against her where to get off at . She stroked her thick elbows . It would be good , but even better if there were some way of changing it all to a Slogum county . She opened the Cleveland papers that came while she was gone and thought of the big white house on the hill above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some day she would set her butt on that hill . Once more she laid the cards , a new deck , so clean the run of red was bright as fresh blood : mostly diamonds , money success , with a few clubs for tears around , but not touching her  --  almost never touching her , for a long time . Finally Gulla stretched her bulk on the familiar comfort of her own bed , but only to wonder again about the Blackie of the crow 's nest . Crazy as a shitepoke he was , but he did n't look crazy enough to confess to the Bullard business just becausesome sky pilot yelled hell-fire . And if he had been bought off , she wondered who was paying , what the next move would be , and if she could prepare for it as handily as she got the stinking Bullard out of his pine box . When Maxon stood up to be sentenced to ten years of hard labor as an accomplice to a murder he had looked over to the Slogums who were going scot-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be the Lord 's ! " he cried out over them , like a preacher scaring sinners . And as Tad Green hurried the prisoner away , the crowd behind him was up , benches upsetting , boot heels stomping wild as a herd of red-eyed longhorns at the smell of blood in a corral . The judge pounded them to silence and ordered the courtroom cleared , but he could n't stop the eyes , the whites brilliant in the windbrownof the lean faces turning back to the Slogums as thep201settlers were shoved from the room to mill around the door outside , waiting . With a ten-year sentence a man might be out in three or four , Lawyer Beasley told Hab before Gulla could drag her son away . She had to go back for Annette too , the girl stopping to ask about getting religion , as Maxon called it , from a sky pilot . She wanted to see the prisoner ; she must know how to tell when you got religion . " My girls are so soft-hearted  --  " Gulla scolded , wiping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well enough that the girl was thinking of the walking preacher of the summer , and of the little Bible he kissed for her . And as Gulla lay on her good feather bed without sleep she remembered the handbills they found in the whip sockets as they left Dumur , little pink handbills announcing :  --  GREATBONFIRE PREACHINGat Dumur Crossing of NiobraraSunday EveningSermon by Pastor Zug : SATAN HOUSETEXT : Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness : none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of theirs : neither shall there be wailing for them . . . . EZEKIEL VII . 11 Tired as she was , Gulla Slogum did not sleep until dawn . While the mother figured the cost of the three colts Bullardand his brother-in-law caught the Slogums driving from the Sass pasture into the hills last May , Libby sat on the crest of the hogback , seeing the pale light from Gulla 's room and otherwise only darkness and chill around her , nothing at all from the canyon where Ruedy 's bright little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at last she knew she must go , and stretching the stiffness of cold and inaction from her legs she pulled Ward 's sheepskin closer about her and went down the steep slope in the starlight , her feet feeling out the path of long familiarity . She almost stumbled into her father hunched forward on the doorstep , so nearly a part of its darkness . And when he knew that it was Libby who had come to disturb him he arose and cried out against her : " Must you hound me too  --  ! " Then he sat back down , trying hard to act as always , drawingher to the step beside him , attempting gayety . " No tornadoes , fires , or floods while we were away ? " he asked . Libby tried to give him words as empty , hoping that he would speak naturally or know that he might hold his silence . But he seemed driven to trivial speech , his bony hands restless in their cupping of the flame as he lit his pipe again and again and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness to the hole of the door behind him , open despite the chill of the night . And several times he said that he was tired , very tired . So at last Libby had to get up . But instead of going away she slipped quickly past him into the darkness of the room , bumping against a chair . And over it , dangling against her face , hung the long end of a rope . And when the girl came back to her father he drew away , far within himself , but she sat down beside him , her hand through his arm . After a while she began to talk . She knew how it was with him , but what good could this do ? Wouldp203the thing he was planning in there restore life to Bullard , manhoodto Rene , or joy to any one of them all ? Sometimes she thought of such things too . It would be worth losing the sun for all time , the song of the bobolink as he climbed up from the spring earth , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not for her , or for him  --  him least of all , for he was not a Slogum but a Ruedy . " Ja , a Ruedy , " the man said bitterly , with the bitterness of road dust on ragweeds where moisture no longer fell easily or fell at all . And because the daughter could not bear to have her father so , she got up , bustled into the house , deliberatelykicking the chair aside , and lit the lamp . Throwing the rope with its short , looped end up through the open trapdoorof the loft , out of her way , she started a fire in the stove and in the fireplace , put coffee on , and laid out supper for both of them from the pail she brought over earlier in the day . And after a while the man began to eat a little , now and then his jaw stopping on a chew , his eyes pale and lidless on some far agony . Silently the daughter drank her coffee and cleared away the dishes . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coals , and when they began to crackle and snap she drew her father to sit beside her on the horsehide rug , a new one , bay , from a young horse . But she did n't notice it particularly because she had his head in her lap as though he were a child , and finalty he slept . When Ruedy awoke Libby was gone and it was bright day . The rope was still looped over the rafter , but on the table was his breakfast with a yellow bowl of late asters he or Dodie had covered every night for weeks against the frost . Outside , above the bluffs , the autumn sky was brightest blue , and on his fish pond swam two mallard ducks , greenheads , makingsoft , friendly talkings to each other in the warm sun.  |p204ALL  the long hours of Sunday Libby kept an eye on the windrows of clouds that spread out of the northwest and moved in a gray blanket over the flat lands , scarcely clearingthe crest of the hogback . Now and then Canada geese honked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yard snowbirds clustered in little rows like dark buds on the ridges of earth . Along about three the clouds lifted a little and the wind freshened . Curls of fine gray snow began to run in from Oxbow Flat , sweeping over the packed soil of the Slogum yard to settle against fences and buildings . Gradually it thickened to white bands in the trails and sifted deep in the bonfire piles that waited for the night preaching on the Niobrara . By evening the wind howled in the chimneys of Slogum House , and the mill tower , the sheds , and even the hitching racks were lost in the driving snow . Several times Gulla plodded to the hall door to look for Hab and Cash , sent out early to spy on the preaching down the river . Just before night they finally appeared at the outside door , their buffalo coats snow-caked , neckerchiefs pulled up over their noses , and their eyebrows heavy-rimed under their hat brims . After a great stomping and sweeping each other off out on the porch they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves of their wet boots while the rocker made a satisfied thump-thumping in the mother 's room.  |p205By  midnight the sky was breaking , and in two weeks the last drifts in the gullies were gone , even from the bonfire piles that were to have lighted the defiant sermon of the tall , blond-bearded preacher from Cedar Flats . Although the winter came in early and white , soon after election the temperature dropped to the cold of a black mid-January . By the time the less forehanded settlers got around to cover their caves and bank up their shacks , only a pick could work the manure that came up in granite slabs and boulders to stand so until spring , giving no protective warmth at all . In the hills the moisture of the early snow soaked the loose , hub-deep sand of the summer passes to a solid creaking under the wheels . With the roads good and the cuts clear , there would be freighting all the winter . That meant continued business for Slogum House , enough for at least one upstairsgirl , and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-footed and slow , brushing the easy tears away with the back of her hand as she moved about the kitchen . In her room Gulla still planned expansion for the Slogums , but an expansion that included no pretty ladies ' room with Nottingham curtains and an alcoved , pink silk bed . Compared to the million acres of land controlled by JudsonPomroy of the Diamond B or even the smaller outfits like Aleck Lawlor 's Flying F or the Lazy J of Lew Jackson , midnight lumber and ladies ' rooms were just so much River Haber privy carpentry . Election time cleaned out the courthouse ring at Dumur and Tad Green promptly got the mitten from Annette . Every day the girl seemed more like a Russian thistle in the fall , russet and soft to the eye but prickly and unyielding , and vacillating in every wind . Gulla saw the revenge of the people upon their officials ,  | directed , she knew , by the hulking , off-eyed Preacher Zug , who , she heard , went all over Dumur County and talked and harangued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old buggy until , the night before election , he was hoarse as a shorthorn bull alone in a meadow . It was said somebody yelled to him from the crowd at Dumur , " You ' re fixin ' to get a bullet in your ribs . " " Ach , but it would be a bullet to sweep our courthouse clean , " the preacher yelled right back . But Preacher Zug would wait on Gulla 's good time . Now she had plans . She knew that the day of the rustler was passing on the upper Niobrara . No longer could a man with nothing but a rope and running iron rise to wealth and respectability here . She knew too that it did n't pay to buy up a new courthouse outfit every year . The only thing to steal now was government land , and the more of that the better . She had . heard the respectful " Mr. Pomroy this " and " Mr. Pomroy that " to the boss of the Diamond B at the Old Settlers ' picnics and such places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only man reelected in all of Dumur County . Yes , it was time the Slogums got more land , a lot more . But Gulla was n't satisfied with fencing free range , sure to bring trouble with the cattlemen now and with the homeseekerscoming in every spring . Of course , the last two years many settlers , new and old , left when the hot winds of August hit them , but some day the rains would come again . If they did n't , even the cattlemen would have to get out . In the meantime she would gather up land like cow chips in a big apron , as much of it legally hers as possible . The timber-claim act and the preemption law had been repealed , but the twins , the two extra girls , and Babbie could each file on a quarter-section homestead for the fourteendollarfee  --  eight hundred acres for seventy dollars before the spring run of settlers was on . Gulla knew she wouldp207have to put up a shack for each one and maybe drive a piece of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards fall , when the six-month residence-establishing period was up . Even so , the only actual outlay in money would be the filing fees . Gulla had overheard many things during her five years of running out to welcome the freighters or listening in the dark passageway outside their bunks . She knew that at first the cattlemen did n't bother to file on the land for their ranch buildings ; that many of their best meadows were probably free land now or covered by some cowpuncher claim that could be won by contest . She stuck Annette 's curling iron into the top of her lamp chimney , tested its heat to a popping against a wet finger , and wound strands of her oily hair around it . With her corset on and her lip plucked until it was red and swollen , she sat with the freighters in their dining room or before the fireplace in the parlor while the cold creaked and snapped the studding of Slogum House . She encouraged Hank Short , Papo Pete , old Bill Billings , and their kind to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expected no desire of them , particularly in this country of few women , they accepted her companionship gladly . And while they talked to Gulla they thought of the wife Libby would make for a poor man and got some close looks at the expensive Cellie and Annette . The most valuable of these sources of information turned out to be lean-faced , watery-eyed Bill Billings , called Old Bill because he was over forty and still punching cows . He wore the same bowlegged shotgun chaps that he had on when he came up the Texas trail in the seventies , so tight he could hardly get his boots through , so worn they almost fell to pieces where the leather was creased . He had seen the final government land surveys finished up in the sandhills ; saw the corner holes when they were still dark , fresh dirt , thep208stakes with the numbers plain on them until the cattle tromped them down or the cattlemen destroyed them to keep grangers from finding the legal description required for filing . True to his kind , Old Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longhorns for the sabre butcher knives of the Sioux . The country was alive as a sheepherder 's pants with game then , antelope tearing away out of every pocket , deer in the brush patches , a buffalo now and then , and elk driftinglike beef herds to the hay flats from Dakota-way in the winter . He got a big bull elk in the township corner where the Jackson corrals was a standing now . Shot him on the side hill . The bullet glanced , and the critter ran down and died in one of the holes . Country was all free land then . No filings hardly at all till just two , three years ago , when the range was getting crowded , big outfits trailing in from up west , and little fellows pushed out by the hoe men coming in , smelling out new grass . Then the land was entered by the flats the government survey maps showed . But the old Frenchman over west there who ' s been locating since the early eighties was claiming that most of the maps was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , which was n't often . Nobody was going to live here nohow and catch them up on it . And maybe Frenchy was right . Anyway , Bill said , he drove for Jackson when he was covering his meadows a couple years ago , and the map that old Lew had made it look like the township corner was in the chophills north of the home ranch , ' stead of in the Jackson corral , where he ' d downed the elk ten years before . Gulla heard about the range and cattle wars too , particularlythe one in Johnson County , Wyoming , not long ago . She even got a copy of the Mercer book , told from the settler side . But she put it away . The cattlemen there made a mess of things ; she would n't.  |p209The  Wyoming Stockmen 's Association interested her . She asked about similar organizations growing up here and there , of brand recordings , of range and itch and rustler control bills Pomroy had before the legislature . She leased up all the school sections within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could . Those already under contractshe marked for watching . There was no telling , these hard times , who ' d get behind on the pay . But what Gulla needed was the actual numbers of the good land still free . Leo Platt had given Ruedy those to the site of Slogum House for five dollars . Five dollars well spent . But he would n't do it again , not that way . And here no amount of curl in her bangs or dressing up the twins would help . So Gulla tied on an apron and , dusting her face with talcum , went to the kitchen to watch Libby prick a leaf designon a fold of white crust with her thin knife . When she had flipped the tender disk over the pie and was scalloping the edge with deft fingers , Gulla finally spoke . " There ai n't your beat in the country when it comes to cookin ' , " she said . " I just been thinking . Your father do n't look so well lately , sort a down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends up a nice dinner  --  " Libby finished the last scallop neatly . " Friends ? " " Yah , you know , those old fellows who squat around and talk with him evenings  --  " Libby set her three pies into the hot oven . " Anybody in particular ? " she asked as she flicked the scraps of crust into a ball with the knife . The woman tossed her bangs . " Of course not  --  maybe Amos Ricker  --  " " Old Amos ! " Libby snorted , remembering the carcass of her cat nailed to the post on the river . " Well , then , maybe Platt  --  "  | Libby slapped the ball of crust flat on the board , came closer to her mother , her mouth suddenly lean as a cut in the crust she had just been working , the knife still in her hand . " So  --  because he ' s beyond your dirty fingers you want me to drag him in . Well , just let me tell you  --  you do him like Bullard or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slogum land ! " Before the girl 's implications the woman drew back , her cheeks suddenly like dirty wax , and , fleeing to her own door , she shot the heavy bolt on the inside . There was Haber in that girl  --  and no telling what ' d bring it out . When Gulla went to Dumur to buy Fanny 's Christmas present , she dropped in at the office of the old county surveyor , out of a job after the first of the year . He pushed the brown bottle at his feet away under the desk , hoping it would n't fall over , and said he did n't really know much about the corners down in the south country . Gulla looked at his whiskey-bloated face and believed him  --  just a brassrailerwho used to deliver the free-lunch vote come November . Oh , yes indeed , ma'am , he went on , he could find corners all right  --  found one down in the Jackson region once . Just out looking for antelope , some years ago . On the way home across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the holes in a little pocket , grass knee-high , and there was the stake , big as life , northwest corner of section one , just about six miles north of Lew 's place ; a handy one to know , ma'am , and he hoped the information would n't go no further . He was using it as sort of a key corner ; marked it with a bottle he had along  --  for drinking water . No windmills in them days , ma'am , and pretty far to water . He ' d set the bottle in the sand up to the neck , in the little pocket right  --  well , off in the hills . Pretty rough country and not worth nothing . He ' d been all over it , yes , ma'am . Not worth a good God  --  not worth a plugged nickel . Yes , indeed.  |p211Asking  him to stop for dinner any time he was down Slogum way , Gulla lifted her skirts from the dirty floor of the office and left . That night she talked it over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land office to take a look at the government plats of the townships south of Slogum House , particularly those of the Jackson range . The first clear night , with a good late moon on the frosty grass , Hab and Cash rode out into the hills towards a little pocket six miles straight north of Lew Jackson 's . This time they carried only one rope , the length of a surveyor 's chain , and they came in with no more than when they left , except that they knew now that old Bill Billings 's running off the mouth was n't all wind . The Big Jackson , the best of Old Lew 's hay flats , was free ; the filings supposed to cover it all lay south in the towering hills . Even his buildings were on government land . But before Gulla got to make the filings Babbie was gone . Early one January morning , when every spear of grass was crystal , every soapweed leaf a lance of green glass rattling in the rising wind , she came plodding , heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had on Dodie 's coat that she tried to hold together before her , and his overshoes , but her head was bare , one ear deadwhitewith cold . Ruedy pulled her into his shack , set her down away from the fire , and rubbed her ear and her hands with snow , talking friendly and pleasant to her as he worked . A long time she seemed dumb , as though struck by some paralysis , but as she warmed the chill left her tongue , and she began to talk . They , meaning Gulla , he knew , said she could n't keep the baby , that it would only die . She must give it away to the home to be adopted out , like the other one . That was all . With her hands folded around herself , she stared into the man 's face , her round eyes dark and frightened . Ruedy tried to comfort her , quiet her with foolish promises while he gave her a bowl of hot grouse soup with some of the noodles Libby made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . too . Babbie nodded , without words . Yes , Libby could do things like that , she knew . After the girl had eaten a little , Ruedy put her to bed , and when Rene and Leo Platt stopped by with the mail he got on one of their horses and rode over to take Dodie 's things back and to tell Libby where Babbie was . Then he swung around by Moll Barheart 's . Two days later Old Moll came to where Ruedy was smoking his pipe out of the wind behind a boulder in the morning sun . Babbie had a daughter , a fine , strong baby . Ruedy nodded , scratching at the graying stubbles of his short little chin . The woman sat down beside him , stretched herself wearily in the sun , and was silent , with the good silence that needs no breaking . " We 've decided I ' m to take them both for a while , " she said finally . Ruedy looked over his pipe at the strong , weather-beaten face of this Moll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she called it . He considered the straight , peppery hair cut short and brushed behind her ears that were like crumpled kidskin , but fine , live kidskin  --  her high-bridged nose , her wide mouth . Yes , it was good so , and right . With their backs to the sandstone boulder the two laughed a little together , like conspirators , as they watched the wind loosen a raveling of cloud from the bank along the north and blow it toward the climbing sun . Although Gulla knew where Babbie went , she ignored this second flight of a Slogum House casualty to Ruedy much as the mine owner River Haber once tried to work for ignored his wife 's charities that kept the mine-blast cripples and orphans alive . Anyway , there were more useful girls than Babbie around loose , brighter , quicker to catch on . Thep213good land Gulla was planning to cover should n't be trusted into the name of a stupid little thing like that , anyway . She would have a higher class of people around her in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in March it began to rain a little  --  light sprinklings at first that sent the settlers out into their yards , their faces turned up to the sky , water running down their furrowed cheeks . That meant a new wave of boomers pushed west by the hard times , even into the farthest drouth regions . So the first nice day Gulla took the twins and the upstairs girls to town for the four filings , and on the way home she thought of the anger that would one day spread like blood in a sack over the face of Lew Jackson , the old-time Dakota cowman who was building a greenhouse for the young second wife and neglecting to cover his best hay flats . Before she went to bed that night Gulla looked long at the redder line of her map , the wider arc . She was moving toward that pretty fast now . Thoughtfully she swung the string of the eraser she hoped to use on the ranches inside the line before too long . All the ranches . But now there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Rene had filed on a quarter section , mostly bluffs and not much good ; besides , he would be harmless enough , get fat and lazy pretty soon . She did n't know that the best protection a bunch of young calves can have is a steer , who will fight off wolf or man as fiercely as any cow . She did n't know that already Rene had two settlers beside him  --  the Jeffers boy whose father Gulla bought out a month ago at sheriff sale on Sundance Table . And Babbie . So Gulla just wrote in the name of Rene , very light , and went to bed well satisfied . And if now and then late at night she thought of Butch or sat up gasping from a dream of his return to Slogum House , perhaps there were others in the house who thought of him also , even now that his name had not been made here for six months.  | Spring came early , hot and dry , with the feverish leafing of a false season after the light rains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow of winter retreated from the wind , the grass shot into bloom barely an inch from the ground . Two years of depression and drouth followed by the brief hope of the spring rains drove out the less hardy , those with a houseful to feed , if they could get out at all . Among them were many old-timers who had somehow hung to their places this long . But Leo Platt did n't go , or Rene , Old Amos Ricker , Pastor Zug and his Germans , or the Polish settlement Platt had started up the river from Cedar Creek . These stayed , living as they could and watching the sky , their faces corrugating like rusty tin roofing in their concern . Down in the sandier regions the grass grew well into June before it browned , and herds of gaunt stock trailed in from the ranches on the fringe of the hard-land region up the Niobrara , the owners pointing out that the sandhills were mostly government land , the fences illegal and easily cut . Because the ranchers were unwilling to risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinned the hills together and , when the grass was gone , bawled their way toward the shipping stations , the market already at depression levels and sinking . Gulla had seen this coming . Her range , although choppier , lighter soil , was the handiest to the incoming settler and the slat-ribbed , dusty herds from the short-grass country . It must be covered by filings immediately . So , with Dodie to open the gates , she went up to Dumur to see Lawyer Beasley , who teetered his short body on legs as long and spindly as a sandhillcrane 's and pulled at his nose awhile . Yes , ye-s , he thought it could be managed . That week the upstairs girls each entered five more quarters , using their names over and over : Eulia Jones signing homestead applications as Eulia Belle Jones , E. Belle Jones , Belle Jones , Belle E. Jones , and Belle Eulia Jones , at five dollarsp215a filing . Then there was Corrie , the new maid that the home for wayward girls gladly sent Gulla now that Babbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Corrie , whose baby was dead , fortunately showed no further interest in men , the matron wrote . She would do very well in a good home . Although Corrie was only eighteen , Gulla used her name for filings too , at a dollar a signature . By this method Gulla and her lawyer cut up the entire Slogum range in a few weeks , covering everything except the chophills and soapweeds that not even a broken-down medicine show man would expect to make a living on , without grass enough to shade a sand lizard . But there was other work to be done before haying time . When the Slogum crew moved into the Big Jackson , Old Lew would be mad as a gut-shot grizzly . So Gulla hired the steadier of Dolly 's girls , girls who would n't sell out on her , to take up land . She stretched their filings , five apiece and each a mile long , east and west through the Jackson and the Lawlor range , with north and south entries to join up at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to file on the quarter where Lew Jackson 's home ranch stood . Because she wanted no more trouble connected with the sons of Slogum House , she sent out a fence crew under Alf Jolley , from up in Dakota , to string four good wires along the far side of the new filings . When Lew Jackson heard about it , he rode hard into the Slogum yard , threw his reins to the ground , and kicked his boot against the screen door . Gulla was ready for him . She asked him into the parlor , had lemonade fetched in . " Us cattlemen got to stick together , " she said , whirling the ice from Ruedy 's cellar around in the pitcher . Old Lew Jackson , who drank straight whiskey and never had business dealings with women , made a very sour face . But he set his dusty hat on the floor beside him and acceptedp216a glass , holding it out from him like a tin cup of bitter wildsagetea . Wiping his short gray moustache with a blue bandana , he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a fence crew to work in his range ? Oh , she was just doing a jag of contract work for some homesteaders down that way , at so much a mile , giving a little work to some poor devils that needed it bad . Lew Jackson choked , sputtering lemonade . " Oh , come off ! " He sputtered and snorted even more when she showed him the fencing contracts that permitted her to surround the best of his winter range and a good chunk of Lawlor 's . But he cooled down fast enough when he saw the filing papers of Annette , Cellie , and the others on his widest hay flats . Dolly 's own filing on his home ranch Gulla held back for an emergency . " How you know you got the hay and me the hills ? " he demanded . But he was only bluffing . He knew Gulla Slogumhad the good land . By now he knew she would see to it that she had what she wanted . He hoped it would n't be the whole country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his leathery cheeks the old cowman rode away . In a week the news was all over the south end of the county , almost everybodyexcept Old Lew and Ted Lawlor laughing at the joke . But not with much enjoyment . There was no telling who would be next . In the meantime the hands from the Lazy J and the Flying F and a few others took to carrying grub boxes and bedrolls again as they did in the old days . But only until the nights got cold , for even freighters soften easily , and Gulla 's upstairs girls came in mighty handy sometimes . And after lunches of dry fried sowbelly between dough-bread , Libby 's cooking would toll a bullwhacker to a Sunday School picnic . When haying time came Cash took his crew down intop217the Big Jackson where the timothy stood belly-high to his horse . Ward was given the head mower and proudly laid out the new meadow , with Annette and Cellie and a couple of visiting sports from Omaha riding alongside . When most of the hay was down it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lasted a week . But Cash , a rustler for work , set the crew to putting up a shack , corrals , and a windmill until the sun came out again . And while the Dumur Duster reported that Lew Jackson and his good wife were spending a month in the cool , shady haunts of the Black Hills , Dodie fenced the stack yards as fast as they were finished , and ploughed two eight-foot strips of fireguard around each one . No accidental or apparentlyaccidental fire could destroy all the hay . Gulla felt pretty safe . Two could play at range burning , and she stood to lose much less than any of the larger outfits , some of them with a hundred head of stock to her one to pay herd on or to buy feed for if the country burned out . East and west there were prairie fires , but Dumur County escaped until the snows came , deep and early , covering all the winter range for the first time since eighty-six . " God damn the Slogum luck ! " Lew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock bawl along the hillsidesof his summer pasture eating the tops off the soapweedsand bunchgrass sticking out of the snowdrifts while Gulla 's cows ate the timothy hay of the Big Jackson . Finally his stock began to die so fast he had to haul in baled hay , his freighters shoveling through the passes after every wind . The Slogums had tripled their herd the last year , and not even the new sheriff who went to Wyoming to shoot elk with Pomroy of the Diamond B could catch Gulla 's sons in anything . Hab had been in the saddle much of the summer . Every week or so little bunches of stock came trailing into the Slogum range for a few weeks of salting and fleshing up before market , the calves , yearlings , and the young shep218stuff to be held over . With money so scarce he could drive a hard bargain ; but not the closest scrutiny by ranch-paid brand detectives at Omaha uncovered even one suspicious mark or a dubious bill of sale . And Gulla discovered how fine it was to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright daylight , riding a good horse , with a square of gay silk blowing at his throat , his skin a smooth brown under his black moustache . She wrote proudly of this handsomepicture of the cowman brother to Fanny , knowing it would be read to all the girls , and with it she sent one of Hab 's orange and black neckerchiefs , china silk , and very pretty . By now Slogum House was the home ranch of the Slogum Cattle Company , with Gulla general manager . Hab , the range boss , and Cash , the crew man , were the next largest stockholders , with all the rest , even Ruedy , represented , a small income banked to each one 's account . But never large enough to encourage independence . The evening after the papers were all signed up Gulla wrote to Fanny , telling her she was now a young lady and part owner of a ranch . It would sound good in the telling to the Eastern girls . Then she laid the cards and found the diamonds very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked the clubs and the spades  --  worry , violence , and death , but still years off . Only the hearts , the cards of love and happiness , were missing . But Gulla never expected too much even of a diamond run , not without help . Ever since the hay crew got into the Big Jackson , now called the Lower Slogum , she doubled her vigilance in the passageway . While Gulla did n't anticipatetrouble just yet , she knew it would come and she must be prepared . The shack she had built in the hay flat was on the line between Annette 's and Cellie 's places , with a bed in each end , and stacks of old magazines . While everyone knew they did n't live there , they drove down now and then withp219their company and one of Libby 's picnic hampers  --  certainlymore indication of residence than any other cattleman filing had . Besides , land contesting was like prairie fires , a game more than one could play . Usually Gulla heard nothing of particular interest in the passageway  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personalremark or two about the upstairs girls . Then one night , along in the winter , she made the round of the stuffy enclosure just in time to hear one of the cowboys saying , " . . . Church outfit ' s a going before the pardon board , trying to get Maxon out , I hear . " " Looks to me like there ' d been an appeal , " Hank Short mumbled from his bunk . " Yeh , but Maxon would n't have it  --  got religion bad , I guess . " There was a grunting and a little swearing as Papo Pete pulled at a tight boot . " By God , " he said , as the boot came at last , " religion must be hell . " That was all , but it was enough , with the threat of Maxon at the trial . Back in her room Gulla pulled the emergency cord that made a little tingling of Hab 's bell . He slipped down to his mother 's door , his galluses still across his elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news he backed away . " I better git out , " he whispered , his hands fumbling at the straps that were to go over his shoulders . Gulla saw the shaking hands , the blood seeping away from behind his dark moustache . " You bastards  --  " she said , spitting with the bad taste of the words in her mouth . " Not guts enough in the lot of you to make one Haber . " Sitting down at her desk , she rubbed her thick palms over her eyes . " Git out , git the hell out , " she ordered when she saw that the man was still helpless in the doorway . " Git to your room and hide under the soogans with your guns around you . I ' 11 think of something . "  | Early the next day she went to see Beasley . He picked at his long nose . " Oh , Maxon could ' ve got out any time , with money enough , " he said , and added ruefully , " but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could discover . Now , with the church people working , all you can do is circulate a petition . " So she went over to see Tom Ruller on the place he preemptedat a dollar and a quarter an acre ten years ago . What with drouth and sickness and bad luck in his stock , Gulla got to buy the land out from under him last fall at foreclosure cost . Because Tom ha 'd a big family and winter was coming on , he had agreed to work the place all the next year for the house use , eating as best they could . He looked serious at Gulla 's demand . " You ' re a hard woman  --  But there was no place to go and another baby coming , and so he sent his boys out with a petition against the releaseof Maxon , while at Slogum House Hab and Cash kept to their room , scarcely coming down to eat . That fellow Maxon was a crazy man , liable to do anything , Hab told his mother . Besides , Cash added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Butch was still alive  --  He let the words hang between them as an accusal and stalked upstairs . Finally it got around to Slogum House that Maxon would n't sign the papers the church people fixed up . He wanted to pay for his crime . The relief in the faces of her sons once more showed Gulla what they were , and turning her broad back she went to her room and slammed the door upon them all , Annette too , who came asking , still wondering about getting religion . Over on Spring Branch Canyon time moved quietly enough . The little plot of grass Ruedy reserved for visitors ' horses was seldom empty , although Platt 's blue roan nibbled there less frequently as the rains returned , sunflowers lined thep221trails again , and the locator 's yard was filled with homeseekerscoming afoot , horseback , in covered wagon and by livery . Once more he resettled the unpatented places in the adjacent hard-land regions and then began to push into the hills . But no one disturbed him or his settlers since the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Rene came over the bluff to Ruedy 's place , staying to read the newspapers and magazines if Libby did n't happen to be there , perhaps taking away Treasure Island or Moby Dick or sitting for an hour just to talk . Sometimes Moll Barheart rode in on one of her white mules , with a book to trade for a while with Ruedy or to talk more about Looking Backward , which had come to them so fortunately through Gulla 's arrangement with the book dealer back in Ohio . As the snow came and the stream of homeseekers slackened , Leo took to riding up Spring Branch Canyon again . And as Ruedy 's hand limbered up from summer work , there was a little music , and always there was good talk about things Rene had almost forgotten since those days with his aunt in Chicago before Ernest Dumur died . Old Moll had heard Jenny Lind when she was a girl ; Rene 's aunt had entertained Oscar Wilde and found him very likable when the door was shut against the curious . And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was back in the Old Country for a visit . They were fine , these evenings , and none finer than the time they got Leo Platt to talk of the O'Neill vigilantes , and the father who always took the powder from his revolver shells so he would n't kill a man , and was finally shot down that way . A long time they were silent , the fire popping loud , and the howl of a coyote coming faintly from the hills . Long before this Babbie married the Jeffers boy , putting their two claims just south of Rene together . By now the little Mollie born in Ruedy 's shack had grown into a gay child , with bright curls and a lisp , and made her mother so proud that she kept her in two clean dresses a day . The older women among the settlers stood away from her , looking on in disapproval . " Just you wait until you got about seven , " they told her . But Babbie smiled and went on washingand ironing , even when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Young Jeffers was a good worker , looked after his land and Babbic 's , helped Old Moll when she needed an extra hand , and Rene , now and then , on both the Niobrara place and his homestead . Babbie , who had profited by her days in the kitchen with Libby , cooked for Rene too . On Christmas Eve they all came to Ruedy 's place . There was a table tree lit with little hand-dipped tallow candles Moll made , a sleepy baby doll for her namesake , a beautifully carved jumping-jack who threw his arms and legs around in a most careless manner from Ruedy 's knife , and two bright dollars from Rene and Platt . And when little Mollie was asleep on the couch with her doll and a dollar in each sticky fist , Ruedy opened his box from the grandmother , an extra large one this year . It was full of books , a tin of Old CountryChristmas cookies , and the little Swiss music box he was so seldom allowed to play when he was a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tinkled out gay little tunes until Ruedy had to blow his nose several times and slip away to the cellar to bring up the wild-grape Christmas wine . Platt went with him to carry the lantern . " How is it with Libby ? " the locator asked , his face lean above the yellow light . Ruedy shook his head . Then his anger rose . " What are you , then , that you can take the brothers away without a gun to help you and can not lift a finger for the sister ! " The young man dropped his face into the shadows , and Ruedy , ashamed , made a great scratching in the straw of the shelf where his bottles lay , half-tilted.  |p223As  always Ruedy thanked his grandmother and received no reply . But the music box helped bring Libby over , Ward too , and there was no keeping Dodie away . It made Ruedy very happy , but no amount of planning would get Libby to come in very often when even Rene was there , never when Leo 's horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask his friend to hide the blue roan in the willows , as he would have liked . Then one May day Leo Platt loped into Spring Branch Canyon with a yellow envelope in his hand . He had carried it so all the way from Dumur , pushing his horse until the blowing animal was sweat-streaked and gaunted . Ruedy looked up from his planting , took the envelope reluctantly , and opened it with awkward , earth-stained fingers . He read it once and let the yellow slip blow in his hand as the wind rustled the cottonwoods above him . He looked over his little place , his ponds , his flowers , the bluffs that had shut out so many things , and finally back to the brown , leather-smooth face of Leo Platt , with eyes so gray and dependable . " You read it , " he begged . " Read it to me . " Aloud Platt went through the slip slowly : GROSSMUTTER LOW STOP COME AT ONCE IF POSSIBLE . It was signed by Maralie , the housekeeper . But Ruedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the grandmother , the day she kissed him goodbyeas she climbed into the carriage to go to a neighbor 's for a visiting , the day the sheriff and River Haber and Gulla came for him . The woman had tucked the dust robe around her knees and called back something about an apple cake in the buttery , adding gayly , in her Swiss-German , as always : " And a day of vacation , all to yourself . See that something good comes of it ! " A day of vacation  --  and see that something good came of it . Suddenly he turned and ran into his shack , dropping his hoe halfway there . He dumped the letters and papers from his old valise , threw a few things into it . When he came out Leo Platt had already wrangled Rene 's team , was driving down the bluff road from the south , ready to go . By hurrying they could make the eight o'clock train east out of Brookley . " Swing round by Slogum House ? " Platt asked as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , and so they drove out of Spring Branch Canyon and south into the hills . Three days later Ruedy stood in the doorway of his grandmother'stall room , before her high , feather-ticked old bed . He was struck by the woman 's incredible smallness , her thin , knotted , somehow still virile hand on the homespun coverlid . She did not stir , but when old Maralie whispered to him that she lay so for hours , sometimes , not seeming to notice anyone , the Grossrutter opened her eyes and in a hoarse , croaking voice ordered the woman to the kitchen . Then , for a long time , she looked under half-closed old lids up to the man . " And who may you then be ? " she asked , her voice alreadygentler , the hoarseness evidently a piece of the slynesssometimes found in the very old towards those upon whom they have become dependent . Ruedy could only look at this woman who had been both mother and companion to him , now within a few weeks of a hundred years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to live . At last the faded , yellowish-blue eyes opened wide . " Talk to me , " she commanded , in her crisp old dialect . And so the man began , stumblingly , hoping to reassure her . And every time he stopped he found her looking up at him , the eyes cunning in the face that seemed to have almost no fleshiness about it any more , nothing that seemed perishable.  |p225He  talked of his own place , his fish ponds , his gardens , and the cascades he had built , of the mallard duck that hatched her young every year behind a clump of bunchgrassclinging to the bluff high above his little house , and of the headlong flight of the newly hatched ducklings , little yellowish-brown balls , down the rocky , gravel slope to the water . There they swam in stately procession behind the mother as she moved so easily over the ponds , or imitated her head-down plunge into the water for food , until only their little twitching bottoms and their bright , kicking web feet stuck up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things a sickening came over him . After so many years of absence was this all he had to say to his Grossmutter , his beloved Grossmutter ? But he kept on , afraid that he must eventually stop , perhaps answer questions , until his words became a desperation . And at last the woman did interrupt him impatiently . " Ja , ja , but the woman  --  ? " Reluctantly he spoke of Gulla and her family , of the house on Oxbow Flat where they lived , of the cattle and the horses they had , and the land . " So much in so little time  --  one does it not so with honesty , " the old woman told him shrewdly , and he had no answer . Then she would know of the children , one after another , and cut short his reticence with impatience again . " These young ones , " she complained , " are they then all wax in the hands of that scheming woman ? " Ruedy rubbed his hand over his thinning , grayish hair , needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them also  --  they who are to take their place with the Slogums of Ohio some day  --  no matter what . " " Fetzelziig ! " the old woman snorted . " And is there not one then who must stand out against her ? "  |p226Disconcerted  by this Grossrnutter of his youth still somehowhoused in the fleshless old hull on the high bed , Ruedy tried to tell her of Libby . But the woman stopped him . " Soon fifty years old and stuttering like a schoolboy ! " she scolded . Then , curiously , she asked , " Did the woman dare name her for me ? " Ruedy nodded miserably , not looking up . " And she is yours ? " the woman drove on , her pale eyes not to be denied . " Ja , " he admitted at last , unhappy at the implication . " Or better , not mine but yours , Grossnautter . Yes , that is it ; she is yours . " " So ? " the old woman said slowly , smoothing the wrinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones held together somehow by transparent skin , her sunken mouth drawing into a grimace across her face . " That pleases me , " she said in German . Reaching up for the bell pull , she brought Maralie to the room and with her help the old woman got up , clutching the black shawl around her stooped shoulders that were once so straight and strong , once so easily , so gracefully carried the pail of water on her head for young William Penn Slogum of Philadelphia to see . At the stairway she looked back into the surprised face of Ruedy , poked him in the stomach with her cane , and , laughing , tapped her way down and out into the garden , with the graying man who was her grandson trailing helplesslyalong , and Maralie wringing her hands in her apron , saying over and over for the man to hear , " She would have it so . Ja , so she would have it , " until the old woman turned on her cane . " One meets tricksters with trickery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to settle before I die . " A week later Ruedy was back home . The next time Libby came over to Spring Branch Canyon Rene was there , withp227a farm paper open across his knee , explaining the advantages of blooded draft horses , particularly Percheron , for the Western farmer . When he saw Libby he stuffed the paper into his coat pocket and went away as always , slipping through the tall sun-touched cottonwoods and up the path his feet were making between his homestead and the little house in the gardens . Libby sat on the stone bench and looked after Rene 's aging boyishness , the gravel crunching under her heel , her face darkening by the same anger every time she saw him . After a while the father took his pipe from his mouth . " He has ideas  --  thinks that the persistent unemployment and unrest in the East will bring a new wave of farmers into the country , now the rains have come again . He sees a growing market for heavier horses  --  with the Spanish War scare , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , blew hard , and put it back . " Rene is a good horseman . His are always fat as butter . " Yes , that was true . Finally Ruedy went into the house and brought out a plump envelope for Libby from the grandmother . In it was a checkbook and a deposit slip for five thousand dollars in the name of Libbette Slogum . The girl looked at it in surprise , and up to Ruedy hovering over her . Yes , it belonged to her , not to Gulla or any of the others , but to her alone . Gradually he told her of his journey to Ohio . That was why he was gone when she was over . " The Grossmutter believes that with her name you will know how money is to be used . " They talked a long time , mostly of Ruedy 's childhood and the woman who mothered him through it , and of what was before them here now ; talked until the stars of the Big Dipperstood clear in the sky behind the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . When Libby finally left , she put the slip for the money deep under the father 's papers so Gulla would never see it.  | To-morrow Ruedy and Rene would go into the horse business . Two good mares to begin with , and a stallion that Rene would stand at his place . It would make him happy , and Gulla need never know about the money she might have put into land , more land , and mortgages . A week later Rene stopped on the way home from the mailbox . With his knee hooked around the saddlehorn , his fingers combing the mane of his sorrel , he talked a while . To-morrow he was going over to Red Butte to size up a Percheronstallion , maybe even go as far as to take the train to Grand Island to look at some good two-year-olds advertised in the Nebraska Farmer . Ruedy scraped the back of his hoe with his pocket knife . Yes , it was important that they start with good blood . As the canyon filled with the shadows of evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the mail sack . He untied it and then rode up along the diagonalhomeward path . He rode gayly , whistling as he had n't for years , not since the night his gentle horse brought him , lying across the saddle like a half-empty sack , to the little house in Spring Branch Canyon . Ruedy watched him go . It took so little to make Rene happy , perhaps so little to make any mortal happy  --  so little and so much . After a while he put his hoe away and , seated on his doorstep , emptied the sack of mail to the gravel at his feet . Among the papers and magazines was a letter in the precise , Old-Country hand of Maralie . He opened it curiously , read the few lines , and , folding it again , sat a long time without moving . At last he went up along the cress-grown thread of stream to the pool of the seepage springs . With the bluffs close about him on three sides , he read the letter again . The Grossmutter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one goes to his bed for sleep after a long day of labor well done.  |p229There  , with the bluffs close about him , shutting out everything but the brightening sky of evening , Reudy looked into the deep pool and slow tears crept down the loose folds of his face into the graying stubbles.  |p230WARD  was growing up . Ruedy noticed it first , perhaps because he saw the lanky boy so seldom since he was brought back sick until he took to coming over to Spring Branch now and then , to sit around in the evenings , often saying not over three words , then slipping away into the dark . He did fewer of the little-boy things , like bringing in the first combs of the buffalo grass or hunting up the burnt nestlings of a late spring prairie fire and burying them . He no longer stopped with stretcher or staples in his hand to watch a horse rollingand shaking the sand from its coat . He smoked a little , a tobacco tag swinging from his vest pocket , rolling his cigarettesquite deftly , and placing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold tooth replacing the one Hab knocked out with the bridle bit so long ago . Fences were Ward 's special care , and he was always snaking a couple of posts to where the bulls had fought across the wire or stapling up a take-down where some coyote hunters or others in an equal hurry made a temporary gate . He became proficient with a rope , but could never equal Hab 's uncanny ability to guess what a critter would do next , and he would never have been good at night work for he did n't have his brother 's cat eyes . Because his slim face was so much like a pale copy of Libby 's , softened by Ruedy 's light eyes and his gentle mouth , Ward took to wearing the reddest neckerchief he could get . Immediately the freighters wanted to know who cut his throat . He coaxed a fierce dip into the forebrim of his bigp231hat , but his face only looked the milder for it , and somehow vaguely suggested the little antelope Ruedy used to have , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip . After a week or so Hab gave him a grinning and passers-by told him to wipe his nose . Later they suggested fertilizer . Axle grease was good , but sheep turds , inside , could n't be beat . The year he was eighteen he saw the Polish girl , Hadda Dubno , at the Fourth of July picnic at Big Cottonwood , and when he noticed the sky again it was another color , and the grass and everything . The girl was slim and fine , with a broad-faced , bursting-checked baby boy astride of her hip . The young American flipped a lighted cannon cracker towards her , and she picked it up and threw it back , laughing as though she did n't know that it might blow away a finger if it explodedin her hand . But the loud bang made the baby cry . And holding his face against her , the girl went away among the trees to quiet him . Before Ward could find her again he had to go to eat with the Slogums at the long plank table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stools and the hammocks early that morning . They ate out in the open , under the tallest trees with the finest shade , Gulla in the centre , just like at home , with fringed napkins and cut-glass sugar bowl and everybody looking at them over each mouthful . When Ward 's greatest discomfort wore off , he considered the others . Gulla was stiffly erect , her black voile bosom pushed up under her chin by her corset . Annette and Cellie barely tasted this and that or sipped slowly and daintily from their lemonade glasses , even when Tad Green came stumbling by , only one o'clock and drunk already . Hab and Cash ate awkwardly , saying " Yes , ma'am " and " No , ma'am " to everything . Only Libby seemed natural , like always , and even she cut a very wide wedge of cake as Leo Platt rode through the grove to where the settlers were gathering in little clots aroundP232white tablecloths spread on the ground , like flies around splattersof milk . The boy saw that Ruedy ate even more slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , without once lifting his face . There was a thinning place at the crown of his head and something sad about the way his hair was brushed behind his fuzzy , sun-blistered ears . Ward saw these disloyal things without meaning to , while . he was itching to get away to find the Polish girl again . You got feathers in your britches ? " Gulla complained , too low for strangers to hear , and for a minute the boy remembered that he had dreaded this day more than any since they brought him back from Wyoming . And just seeing the Polish girl made it happier than he knew any day could ever be . Finally he escaped from the table and wandered away , apparentlyfollowing a turtledove 's cooing in the dust of the road down toward the brushier end of the grove , where the white people , as they called themselves , let the Polaks gather . The girl was there , helping the older women , and although most of them wore headcloths , white or of fine black lace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country ways . She did n't think them funny as some of the other Polish girls did , those who gathered around the American soda-pop stand giggling and teasing everybody to buy them drinks , or wandering off to the men still working around the barbecue pit or clearing the race track of the grass mowed early that morning . While the American boy stood off , watching , two of these girls , with talcum powder like flour on their faces , saw him . Chattering in broken English , they came to where he stood , laughing before him , their arms around each other . He started away , but they followed , getting closer and closer , and finally one of them grabbed his new black cowboy hat and put it on . The other ran ahead of her a little way and shamed her with her fingers , crying , " Ah , she isp233put man 's hat on , man 's hat on . It mean she is want he should kiss ! " Flushing , not knowing what to do to get his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Look at ' im , red as a turkey gobbler ! " Then the girl started to run and he after her  --  dodging around trees , over a log , between people who cheered them on , whooping , dogs barking , a frightened baby squalling . Suddenly , when he was right behind her , the girl tripped over a buggy tongue and they went down together . " Now you got her hog-tied  --  kiss her , you damn fool , kiss her ! " Old Bill Billings shouted , jumping up and down on his bowed legs , like a frog . But Ward only picked himself up and , pounding the dust from his hat , put it on and stalked away , the back of his neck burning in the folds of bright blue neckerchief . And from one of the Slogum hammocks Gulla looked over to him with disfavor . " Ca n't you find anything else to do with yourself besides chasing around after those Polish fly-up-the-cricks ? " So the boy went to where his horse was grazing . Leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grove and all its people as strangers , wondering what he had to do here with all this red , white , and blue bunting , the flags , the dust and firecrackers and the laughing . But from where he stood he heard a Polish accordion playing a gay little tune that came like wind through the trees and a woman calling " Hadda ! " and from down by the river came an answer . The Polish girl skimmed one last flat stone across the stream and came running to take up the fat , crying baby again . So Ward drew up the cinch , slipped the bit into the mouth of his horse , and , making him rear up high , he tore out of the grove , leaving a string of dust to settle slowly behind him . And all the way home the sound of the loping hoofs on the hard soil said : " Had-da , Had-da , Had-da. "  | After seeing the girl that one time , she was in everything : in the first rays of the morning sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ; in the bobolink 's steep climb into the sky and his shower of song as he slanted clown into the grass to his mate ; in the swift flowering of the July thunderhead , the drip of the water from the tin can to the sickle bar he was grinding . He saw that the sunflower-bordered road was like a strip of gray and yellow corduroy , that the little whirlwinds sweeping the tablelands were joyous spinninggirls in fine , gay skirts like in Ruedy 's books . He began to whistle at his work and the sullen lines that sat about his mouth ever since the day he had to shoot his dog were gone . He worked comfortably , his shoulders taking the load easily as plough handles the looping lines of the farmer . He was up in the morning without calling and away to drive in the work horses or helping Dodie with the chores , making a wild singing of the milk in the pail , and foaming it high above the brim . Often , now , Libby was in Ward 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use Gulla had made of her fear for his helplessness in Slogum House . He knew now about Leo Platt , something of what had been between the two , and he avoided his sister , and was gruff and short and unhappy for her . Sometimes he planned great things for them all , for Libby and her man from the river , for Hadda and himself  --  great things in which there was no Slogum House . On the sly he took to going up the Niobrara , to the edge of Platt 's Polish community above the mouth of Cedar Creek . It was the Hadda he was seeking , a slim , shy girl of about sixteen , with broad white teeth , eyes gray as a kingbird , and a redding in her cheeks like wild plums in the sun when an American boy stood looking . Because Ward was too bashful and aware , too , that the Polanders knew he was a Slogum , he never asked for her ;  |p235although  he sometimes hung around the Polish platform dances , back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up on the Dubno place , hoeing in the blue-green patch of cabbage on second bottom . And many , many times after that , but never close enough to talk . Sometimes he saw her run through the meadow after the milk cows , stopping to throw stones into the noisy blackbirds swaying in the cattails , and sometimes he heard her call lusty Polish curses to the cows when they took refuge in the rose-brush patches , or sing a gay little song when they walked in single file down the path homeward , the bell of the leader ringing at every step , soft and like music . It was right that it should sound like music , for the bell was hand-poured and had tolled over the green hills of Poland when the homeland was still a great nation . It had hung , burnished and gleaming , from the neck of the white dowry heifer of the first daughter to leave the house as a bride for five generations and would go with Hadda one fine day . As often as he could Ward sneaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluff overlooking the Dubno place , a slim ash tree that swung wide in the wind and storm with a big boy clinging to the trunk to watch Hadda strip the flying wash from the line or run'to gather up the little white chickensinto her apron as the wind scattered them like balls of cotton . And on Sundays after early Mass there were Polish gatheringshere and there ; wagons , buggies , horsebackers , and dusty walkers drawn maybe toward the Dubno grove near the river . There all morning the women fussed over the long tables , the men sitting in the shade , smoking , drinking , talking , waiting for the unpacking of the baskets . Children and dogs ran loud along the river and through the trees ; groups of naked boys splashed below a bend ; and young people played games and danced to the accordions as the sun slipped up the slopes of the canyon , and on late into the night by the light of lanterns hung among the trees . But even in the biggest crowd Ward could pick Hadda from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with weeks between a glimpse of the girl , perhaps at the Bartek post office in an old coat of her brother 's that her expanding shoulders found too small . Now and then he rode to Spring Branch Canyon for a long evening , and his father saw that he was a new person . Not so much a Ruedy like the Grossmutter but a Slogum like his grandfather , who saw a Swiss girl with the pail on her head and married her in a week . Through the worst days of drouth and hard times there were literaries and box socials and dances among the settlers . No matter how hard up they were or how many hung themselves with picket ropes or had to haul out their wives who had seen too much of isolation and privation , there were alwaysthese things open to everyone . And now , with the rains and war prices , there were housewarmings for those who moved out of dugout into sod houses , and from sod into big frame . But Ward could take no part , for everywhere he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyote hunts , where settler and ranch hand and snake killer gathered , Rene too , and sometimes Ruedy , were beyond the boy . Not because of the killing . There was little enough of that . Usually the few coyotes anybody saw were on far hillsides and gone in a minute . It was a get-together of all the region , with a big feed and maybe dancing , music and dancing . But somebody would point him out and then he would have to go . All Ward could do was hang around the post office and wait for spring . And when it finally came he was away again to the Niobrara River . Once Ruedy tried to say something of this to Libby . She nodded . She was watching Hab and Gulla closely.  |p237But  Gulla had little time for Ward beyond taking him to the land office and swearing he was twenty-one for his homesteadentry , a good enough quarter of grazing land joining up some of her hay flats , but not good enough to make a living on . She was even neglecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her on the mother 's desk , under the map of Dumur County . Her face was slim and pointed , a little like Ward 's , the delicate skin fine-textured from much care , her eyes demure , her mouth small and carefully set , her pompadour a pale halo . Miss Deane had written Gulla a fine letter . Of all her girls , none was more poised and gracious , better prepared in French and music and decorum for a successful debut than her dear Fanny . Somehow Gulla had not looked between schooling and the girl 's final establishment on the hill above the Ohio Slogums . She could n't drop everything now , buy out the place above Slogum Acres , not when there was so much here at the tips of her itching fingers . Besides , there was all the stink of the colt-stealing case that had got into the papers , with Bullard 's killing and the Maxon trial . And no telling when it might come to life again , although Maxon , his time served , was working in the penitentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a good baker and preached to the men of God , the warden let him stay . And Hab , particularly , breathed easier . But Fanny was still to be looked after , and so Gulla arrangedwith Miss Deane for an advanced course in music and painting at advanced rates . In the meantime Gulla turned to her range problems . The hard times were over . But they were not gone for the millionswho had lost everything in the panic years , or for the army of unemployed that seemed somehow , contrary to all prediction , not to disappear . Many took their last dollar and went west with the spring or were helped onward by impatient relatives . And now that every spot of hard landp238was settled , here and there they began to sift into the hills , into the free range that had once more been permanently partitioned between the cattlemen . The cowmen looked out under the wide gray brims of their Stetsons and saw these venturesome homeseekers come into the free-land region that they had divided among themselves , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rancher . Deemer of the Bar UY , who was said to have the right to two , three notches on his own gun and over a dozen on his snake killer 's , saw no reason to change the method that was keeping his range clear , the land seeker beyond his fences . Judson Pomroy was a gentlemanand did not intend to soil his hands or those of his English employers , so he left the responsibility of preserving the range to Clancy Haw , the foreman , and went to Californiafor his heart . Lawlor of the Flying F vacillated . One day he was for potting every damn hoe man in the country and the next he was for selling out and quitting the business while he was still ahead . Like the coyote that fattens in hard winters , Gulla watched from the duskiness of her room . But there were many ranchers like Lew Jackson , old wind and straight whiskey cowmen , who did little more than curse the settlers , hoping , even believing , that they would all starve out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills stuck to the land like sandburs to a saddle blanket . They stuck together , too , the women going miles on . the stormiest nights to catch babies as Gulla used to do in Dakota , the men dropping everything to help throw up a soddy before the swift descent of winter upon the late corner , to shuck out a sick man 's patch of squaw corn , to bury him when he died . And sometimes on Saturday afternoons they piled into hayfilledwagons , rumbled over eight or ten miles of frozen road , to a literary , a box social , a housewarming , or a dance ,  |p239|picking  up the settlers all the way . And slowly the cowboys took to going too , for some of the hoe men 's daughters had dimples and bashful eyes that could make a born cowpuncher trade his horse and saddle for a walking plough . Leo Platt was often at the fringe of the stags , always numberingat least three to every woman . Usually he sat on his heels somewhere near the door or in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weather . Now and then he stood up , stretched his long legs , and danced a bit too . Sometimeshe even ate supper with someone , but never twice with the same . Several times on nice nights he saw the young Ward standingoff outside somewhere , looking in , listening to the fiddles and the accordion , the stamping feet , the caller bawling out over it all , and girls laughing as they were swung off the floor . But at the first noticing the boy always slipped away . Many of these new settlers left with the dry winds of July , or at the first breaking of the roads after a hard winter . But not enough of them never enough of them to please the cattlemen . Against the stickers that would encourage others they could use hired snake killers , not so safe now that there were more settlers , and armed . Or they could have the checkbook ready when the land was patented at the end of five years . But even Lew Jackson saw that it would be best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them unload their breaking ploughs that skinned the low places for sod for their houses , split the meadow land for their crops like a hunter 's knife the belly of a deer . Either they had to scare the homeseekers away , like Deemer did , or cover the range with safe filings ,  --  cattleman filings , as they were called , entriesby cowboys and hoboes who had no intention of establishinghomes ,  --  or by frankly fraudulent filings . If the entry went uncontested and unprotested through final proof , the land was patented and passed permanently into the hands of the cattleman.  | But the land hunger of the world seemed unsatiable . Every acre not actually covered decoyed the homeseeker as a green cornfield tolled a range cow , and barbed wire seemed as poor a barrier against one as the other . Protests against illegal fencing and fraudulent filings poured into Washington . Leo Platt and his surveying outfit were almost constantly on the range , all the way from Gulla 's hogback to the south road , appearing suddenly in a meadow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ranchers suspected he was smelling out the country for the government and would have liked to order him out , but the locator knew his rights , and since the Bullard trial his thirty-thirty rifle was always across his saddle , with usually at least one green coyote hide hanging behind the cantle to testify to his marksmanship . Lawyer Beasley was getting uneasy about the Slogum filings , looking down his long thin nose , talking about the risk and a fee " commensurate thereto " in cash . Not Cellie or Annetteever got a second look from the agate-eyed Beasley , nor would he have canceled checks produced as evidence against him . Gulla considered the whole thing a plain hold-up and lumberedaway down the rickety steps from his office . As she expected , he called her back , still advocating caution , however . There was agitation in Washington ; investigators out , he said . There was talk , too , of a lease law to the present holder of the free land . All the little fellows were fighting it . Cattlemen trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their illegal fencing legal , and keeping the range from all settlement and competition for all time . Anyway , Beasley intended to walk light until he knew what was coming . He did n't have the constitution for a cold , wet stone cell . Gulla looked at him . That was it : he looked like a jailbird . Back at Slogum House the woman squeezed her expandingfat through the hot , close passageway to listen careful out/side the freighters ' room . Pomroy , with his clean-nailed fingers in the political pie , would know what was going on and maybe his freighters had picked up something . But she heard little to help her . Either the bosses were getting closemouthor they did n't know much more about what was ahead than a tenderfoot in a sandstorm . Then one evening , when she seemed to be hearing only silly gossip , like a bunch of old women talking at a sale , she suddenlyheld her difficult breath and flattened her ear to the peephole in the wall ; " Joe ' s seen the kid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider was saying . " Onct him and that Dubno gal was picking sand cherries and ether time they was just a foolin ' around . " " Where ' d you say she lived ?  --  I could do with a little foolin ' around with a juicy young piece myself , " a puncher from south of the tracks said . " Aw , hell , you dirty-minded son of a gun  --  they was only standing along the fence , a talking . That Ward ' s a damn nice kid  --  " " Yeh , but hel 's the fence crawler of the bunch , " Hank Short said through a fat splattering of tobacco juice in the sandbox . " An ' there ' 11 be hell a poppin ' when old Gulla gets wind of it . " Then there was laughing and dropping of boots . " What I ca n't figger out , " Papo Pete was saying as he shed his pants , " is how she ' s kept the bunch together all this time . " And Hank answering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lot ' 11 mostly keep the young bulls to home , all except that squirt , Ward . " Back in her room Gulla was walking the strip of worn rag rug , as many times before . So the freighters were talking like that about her boys and those chippies she kept a purpose for the dirty freighters ' own tailing . Well , they could gop242to hell for theirs from now on . It was not good to have such women on a ranch of importance , anyway . As for Ward  --  she considered him more carefully . It was not the first time he had strayed from her hand . No other one of her children , not even Libby , had given her as much trouble . Where did he get this daring ? Suddenly a new thought came to her . Maybe he knew something about Butch , something that gave him the power not to be afraid , or maybe he had not been afraid all along , even before he ran away because Hab knocked out a tooth . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Dodie bring the buggy up to the door . Without even telling Libby where she was going , she drove off towards Cedar Creek crossing and on to Platt 's Polish settlement up the Niobrara . She inquired for the Dubno place and , because she knew that these Poles were the men of the family , she drove directly to the field . She watched the stocky farmer come down the corn row , his powerful shoulders stooped between the handles of the walking cultivator , reaching out here and there to pull a sunflowershooting into early blooming . Straightening up in the dust raised by the shovels , he slapped the lines tied about his waist and shouted " Geedap ! " each time as though the mares had stopped their plodding . And when the tired team dared lag , he reached back to the whip dragging from his wrist and cracked its long leather lash across the rump of the nigh mare . At the end of the row he looked up to the woman waiting in the stylish American buggy , wiped his sweat-streaked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn leaf , and looked again as he tipped up the water jug to flood his parched throat . At last he spoke . " Hallo  --  what-you-want ? " running the words together in his very broken English . " You are Ignaz Dubno ? " The man nodded , drinking again.  | " You have girl , maybe sixteen , seventeen year old ? " Gulla dropped unconsciously into an imitation of his speech in the hope of making him understand . The man scratched his head a while . " Geerl ? " he said at last . " Jo , what-a-you-want ? " Patiently the woman told him she wanted the girl to come to her , that her son had been looking her over and they decided that she would do to help with the men at Slogum House . " Help mans  --  in-a-field  --  where ? " he wondered . No , no , Gulla tried to explain . Not in the field . With the men , in Slogum House , big house  --  pointing away towards the blue hogback , narrow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cedar Canyon . The man raised his shaggy , dust-filled brows , pointing his blunt thumb over towards the place too , trying to understand . " Slokum ? " he asked , suspiciously . And once more he demanded , " What-a-you-want ? " The woman went over it all again . Her son , tall man on black horse , had come to look at the girl . She was pretty ; would be good for Slogum House . " What she got do ? " he asked , his head thrust forward , his short legs wide apart . " Do ? " Gulla smiled coyly from the buggy . " Be good to men who come there , make them laugh , sleep with them . " That last he understood . Deliberately he reached back with his fingers to grasp the whip dragging from his wrist . With a quick jerk he brought it across the woman 's knees , and then , lashing her horses into a plunging , he shouted Polish curses after her so far as she could hear , good Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once Gulla looked back through the rear glass in the top buggy . The man was still standing in the middle of the road , feet wide apart . Down in Cedar Canyon she stopped her team , bathed thep244welt across her knees in the tepid water of the creek , and , getting back into the buggy , drove home . Once or twice she hummed a little , tunelessly . Ruedy and Libby were on the south porch stringing beans for drying when Gulla drove into the yard . She was surprised , remembering suddenly that Ruedy had scarcely come to Slogum House on more than an errand now and then , since  --  well , in years . While she tied her team for Dodie 's coming she decided on friendliness until she knew what was afoot . " Hello , stranger , " she said to him , as she wiped her red face with one of the clean towels above the freighters ' wash bench . Ruedy acknowledged her greeting but had no more to say , and so she took her hat into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as she went . In the dusky hall Hab was tilted back on a chair against the wall , waiting . At her coming he let the legs hit the floor and arose . Where in the devil had she been , and nobody knowing ? Hell was a popping . A couple hours ago Annette had come running in , all give out with excitement . And only a minute to spare , pretending she had to change her dress . While she changed she told Libby she was going up to the land-office town for the Sunday with Lancaster , outside in his buggy . " Who ? " " Lancaster  --  that gant-gutted land attorney for the DiamondB . " Gulla pulled at her lip . Yes , she knew him . What was up ? Looked like there was a bur under every saddle blanket in the whole range country . Some time ago the cattlemen had word there was to be a public land investigation , but they would n't believe it , not with their banker connections and the Vice President of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government agents were out all over the country , investigating fraudulent filings and illegal fencing , starting with the bigger outfits first , the Diamond B and the Flying F in Dumur County . Pomroy was riding Lancaster , and Lancaster ' s running around like a nester 's wife in a windstorm , trying to get everything under cover and drinking to drown his troubles on the side . Annette was sticking to him to get what she could . There was n't nobody around , so Libby left a note and went over to see Ruedy , thinking that as he kept up on the news he might know what to do . He was n't much surprised . Figgered the big outfits would be first , probably . Maybe all the little fellow would have to do was lay low and abide by the law now . " He do n't know ! " Gulla complained . " He do n't never know anything about our troubles . " Hab looked at her as a grown man now , his face leaner , thinner , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s where you ' re way off , " he said flatly , and ignoring the mother 's quick purpling at this tone from her eldest son , he spit into the cuspidor at his chair . " Yeh , Dad  --  " Gulla started at the word , so strange on Hab 's lips . " The old man  --  " he corrected  --  " the old man knows a hell of a lot about them things  --  " " He ' s always been against me . " The son moved his bit of tobacco about in his mouth . " Oh , hell , now  --  he does know what ' s going on outside the hills , in Washington . Come on out  --  he ' 11 tell you what I mean . " So they went out to the porch , and when Corrie brought the lemonade and went away , Hab got Ruedy to tell what he knew about the land investigations . There probably was n't much to be done now , he admitted . Fencing government land had always been illegal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it , and Cleveland was defeated and Sparks put out by cattleman influence . Now the pressure of economic unrest was forcing the **25;4505;TOOLONG to the public domain once more as a safety valve , and this time the Secretary of the Interior and the President were working together . This time there might be results . " And you ' 11 help them  --  " Gulla cried out against him . The unhappy man looked at his knotty , calloused hands . " It ' s the same law that made our settling here possible that they ' re enforcing , " he offered apologetically . " Seems to me the problem is to put out any fire there may be in the Slogum pants , " Libby suggested . " The big fellows have pull . They ' 11 save their own skins and use the Roosevelt investigation to rid the range of any pushing little fellows that ' re crowding them , like these same Slogums  --  " Yes , that was true , Ruedy admitted , but Roosevelt knew those tricks , he believed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a petition against it . If Leo  --  if anybody came with one , he intended to sign . For the present the really serious charges , it seemed to him , would be fraudulent filing upon government land and the intimidation of settlers , with the penitentiary waiting on proof of either one . Hab and Gulla thought of the five filings apiece entered for Corrie , the upstairs girls , and those from Dolly 's . Gulla remembered the animosity of the crowd after the Maxon trial . They ' d be like hungry grays around a down cow if she was sent to the penitentiary . This was what Beasley had been afraid of and he knew the law , or thought he knew how to avoid it , taking her money and giving her talk of damp , cold stone cells . Just thinking about it made a quivering in the depths of her thick body . All the work , the planning and scheming , of thirty years gone . She could n't stand it , and getting up she began to walk the porch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ' s what she got for marrying a fish-belly Slogum  --  " Sitting over there on your backside all this time and not saying a word  --  knowing it was maybe the penitentiary  --  " and Ruedy had to bow likep247a lone cedar on a butte before a northwest wind , looking down into the handful of green beans in his lap . It was Libby who pointed out that this was no time for squabbling like a bunch of magpies over a piece of chicken gut . So Gulla calmed down a little and began to plan . Deemer , Pomroy , and Lawlor and the other big ranchers were at Washington to see Roosevelt . Maybe they could hush the matter up , get their lease law . But Ruedy believed indictmentsfor land fraud were imminent in spite of everything , judging by Lancaster 's actions . Yes , Libby agreed . He told Annette secret-service men were going around pretending to be everything : hobos wanting to file for the cattlemen , hay waddies , settlers , or even English capitalists looking for a good investment in Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hab ordered , rising to the weakening of Gulla . But the mother had her plan ready . Although she had intended to send the girls packing this very day because of her sons , now she would keep them under her broad fingers every minute . " And have them sell out to the first government man  --  " she told Hab , her mouth the lean slit of Butch . And once more the son was defeated . " They ' 11 come snooping here too , " Libby warned , tossing the bean strings in her apron to the wind of the yard and putting the paring knife away . By this time Gulla was already planning to clear out Genie 's room , set up a couple of double beds there , and put any strangers to sleep away from the upstairs girls and the freighters , where she could watch them . A letter must go to Dolly to-night . She was used to handling men , and with a little warning her girls would pull back like a knot-head buckskin on his first rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They might even pick up valuable information for her . Hab volunteered to make the trip with the letter himself and then Gulla knew that to him this was really serious . That dirty bastard of a Roosevelt , the turncoat  --  a cattleman himself and now making war on them , she thought , as she helped get Hab an early supper and even coaxed Ruedy to have a bite with them before he went back to Spring Branch Canyon . Then she went to her room to lay the cards . But they were mixed in color to-night as the get of a Jersey bull . And several times she went up to listen in the passage outside the sons ' room , for she had seen that Cash , too , was afraid , and remembered the time Hab caught him saddling the unbrandedhorse in the back shed . But now he knew that Gulla was watching . Not until after midnight did Gulla notice that Ward had not come home . Huge in her gown at Libby 's bed , she urged the girl to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think he needs looking for ? " " I have a premonition  --  " was all the mother would say , and so Libby dressed as fast as she could , saddled the wranglinghorse in the shed , and rode over . Ward was there , on Ruedy 's cot , doubled up , face to the wall , his head and back thick with clumsy bandaging . Over him stood the father , his hands futile . It seemed Ward had been waiting for Hadda Dubno when she went for the cows . Suddenly two big Polanders jumped out of the brush , grabbed the black 's bridle , dragged him from the saddle , kicked him in the belly with their cowhide boots , and pounded him with ash clubs . When Ward came to , the Polanders were gone , his horse was standing over him , and so he managed to get to Spring Branch Canyon . " Where all the casualties come , like to the Salvation Army , " Libby said angrily . But Ruedy did n't notice . He was put/ting away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old sheet . " I had to take six stitches in his scalp , and his back is almost cut off him , " the father worried . " He has pains , too , in his bowels , but he wo n't have a doctor . " Libby tried to talk to the boy , but it was with him as the time he had to kill his dog . Perhaps he knew that Gulla had been to see Ignaz Dubno that day . Anyway , he seemed in a dark and bitter country where neither she nor the father could reach , and so she went out into the night , Ruedy followingher . With the reins across the neck of her horse she stopped a moment . " The Polanders do n't seem to be quite so thorough as  --  as some people , " she said . Then , without waiting for a reply , she loped away to Slogum House , sent Dodie for the doctor , and returned to watch with Ruedy through the night . She had n't gone in to Gulla at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning Dr. Hamlin drove through the Slogum yard and Gulla , shouting instructions to Corrie , ran puffing out to his buggy to show him the way to Spring Branch . " Attacked by settlers , " she explained about Ward . " Kicked in the stomach . " " Vomiting ? " Gulla wiped the sand from her lap , as though she had not heard . " Oh , I thought he was your son  --  " the doctor explained , looking at her over his glasses . " He is , " the woman said , folding her arms across her loose uncorseted stomach righteously . " But when he is hurt he runs to his father ! " The doctor nodded gravely , smoothed his small , professional goatee , and , clucking his tired , plodding team into a trot , was silent the rest of the way . The second time Gulla entered Ruedy 's home on Spring Branch he was at least there to greet her , to give her a chair beside the cot of their injured son . But Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and Ruedy explained miserably that the boy had been delirious in the night , and hot , feverish , he thought . No , no vomiting . Swiftly the doctor went over the bruised and beaten body , almost smiling a little as the well-salved bandages came off the head , exposing the scalp stitching . " That ' 11 be all right , I think . You pulled it together well and it ' s healing already . Do n't know as I could have done better  --  a little more ornamental , perhaps , but ten hours later . " But he was not so jocular about the abdominal injury ; the skin bruised and purpling , hot to the touch , hard underneath ; the doctor 's proddings bringing gray sweat to Ward 's forehead . Yes , this was serious , very serious . The boy should be in a hospital . " I was just taking him home , " Gulla announced . But the boy heard and , bracing on his elbows , he tried to get up , crying , " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulla , to all of them , and then fell back in a faint on Libby 's arm . He would n't take anything all the night , afraid that he would find himself back at Slogum House as once before . As once before , the daughter repeated , her cold green eyes steady on the mother . The doctor stroked his goatee between the women . At last he told Gulla that he wanted some things from the house , and when he got her there and out of the buggy , he clucked up his team and drove back alone , leaving her standing before all the freighters . When the moon was high , a sliver of whitish glass overhead , the doctor had to return to Dumur , leaving Ward asleep with an ice pack and Libby stretched out on the bay horsehide rug beside the boy 's cot . Ruedy turned the lamp low and went out to sit in the friendly rustling of the cottonwood that tow/ered towards the crest of the bluffs . Twice he lit his pipe , his face tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave it up and , pounding out the tobacco , put it into his pocket . Forty-eight hours , the doctor thought , forty-eight hours would tell whether the boy must be rushed to Omaha , probablytoo late , or if nature and a good constitution from the Ruedys and the Habers would carry him through . " These boys raised out here in the West  --  they ' re tough as whang leather , " the doctor had said , slapping Ruedy 's shoulder encouragingly as he left . But the father 's pain was too deep for even such friendly reaching . At Slogum House Gulla stationed Dodie at the gate to bring the doctor in for a bite of supper and to hear of her eagerness to have Ward where she could nurse him right . See , she was a good mother , her whole fussiness was to indicate , so loving and anxious that she could even forgive the things of this morning . The man ate , but he refused to have the boy moved , and when he was ready to go it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Gulla noticed that and thought it looked good so , but with Cash it was neither sentimentnor pretense . There was something the matter with him . Something bad , he was afraid . Dr. Hamlin looked at the red embarrassment in the sunburnt face and recalled the rumors he had heard of the second-story girls at Dumur . " A good bartender never touches the stuff he sells , " he remarked , as he took the lines . " However , I ' 11 be along down this way to-morrow and we ' 11 see . " The next day the doctor found Ward the same and , after an examination down in Spring Slough , he assured Cash that he was right . He had a dose , a good one , gave him a box of tablets and some instructions , and ordered him to report at Dumur once a week . " And for God 's sake do n't keep it in circulation ! " The third day , the crucial one , Ward was no better , nop252worse . That evening about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plough mare came up Spring Branch . It was the girl Hadda , bareheaded , her long brown braids flopping , her head turning back every few jumps to search the dusty trail behind her . " He is here ? " she cried of Libby , who was reading beside the cascading little stream . The Slogum daughter got up and , with her arm around the girl , led her to the door of the shack and pushed her in alone . Hadda stopped beside the cot , not seeing Ruedy in the duskiness of the room at all , seeing only the boy , his head still turned to the wall . " Ah , it is bad ! " she cried to him at last , and at her voice Ward turned slowly to look up at her , not believing that she could be there . " I hafto get married to-morrow  --  " she said , knotting and unknotting her strong , sunburnt hands . " I hafto  --  tomorrow  --  " Then suddenly embarrassment overcame her and she ran out , climbed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy run away toward Cedar crossing . When the sound of the pounding hoofs was gone from the canyon Ruedy came out to stand beside Libby at the pool . " I could put a bullet through my head if it would make it better for them  --  " he said . Three days later Annette came back to Slogum House , driving Lancaster 's shining outfit . Dodie was told to unhitch the matched team of blaze-faces and turn them into the horse pasture to rest and fatten a little . The new buggy , with red wheels , special springs , fine red leather upholstering , and a mirror on the lady 's side , Dodie was told to grease and oil and polish well . Lancaster , Annette said , had skipped to Mexico , and there was an edge of contempt in her voice for this running away , despite her knowledge of the many other cattleman agents who suddenly established foreign residence.  |p253By  now Ward seemed a little better , although he was still packed in ice . He seldom spoke , not even when Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his arms that had been like skin over dry bones from the prairie were filling out a little . Gulla still sat like an angry lump in her room at Slogum House . She had finally heard that the Grossmutter was dead , and although she had investigated and found that there was nothing for Ruedy , she was annoyed that she , his wife , had not known of his trip back to Ohio . The least he could have done was to take her along , make the old woman accept her , before she died . And now they were keeping her from her baby boy  --  that Dr. Hamlin , Libby , and Ruedy  --  and she would not soon forget it . In the meantime government agents came and went , some that were put into Gellie 's room and some no one suspected . Ruedy saw in the papers that intimidation of settlers would be the gravest charge , one from which the Slogums were technically free . Outside of the two homesteaders who suddenlyleft their unfinished sod walls the time Gulla settled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only Rene , Jeffers , and Babbie had actually dared settle in the Slogum range , and they had not been molested . But not all the ranchers felt as secure . All the snake killers , usually handsome , arrogant , well-mounted young chaps handy with their guns , vanished like chicken hawks with the snow of fall . The cattlemen got friendly with the settlers , even when they knew there was fresh beef hidden away in the cave somewhere . But it was too late . Ruedy came over to tell Gulla that the fences would probably have to come down soon . Suspectingthat he was right , she passed the information on to Hab as her own , for she had not forgotten the respect he showed for Ruedy the time her husband showed a little useful information from all his sticking a shiftless nose in the papers . And with the fences down , Gulla Slogum knew that those who had stock and the men to herd it would get the grass . Cash was sent out to locate ten or a dozen reliable men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hab looked up several thousand head of young stock that could be shipped in at fair terms any day he wanted them . Two thirds of the cattleman fences were on free land . Gulla 's were , every foot , on homesteaded area , filings she controlled . Now let Roosevelt order the country opened . As Ward improved Ruedy tried to pass the time by reading to him from the Dumur Duster . There were some things the father skipped , as the item saying Yonak Polaski , age forty-three , married Hadwiga Dubno , age seventeen . His neck burning and his eyes watering , he slipped to safer topics . And once or twice , when Ruedy , spoiled by too long aloneness , chuckled at something in a book , the boy rolled himself over carefully and , holding his hands to his belly , asked to know what it could be . After that Ruedy always managed it so , waiting until he was urged , until in the end he read many of his books aloud to his son . But between these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the old Swiss music box , when he only lay , or later sat , his eyes straight before him , his palms turned up , lax . Once or twice Ruedy tried to get him to talk of the things within him , the thoughts that seemed to flow like the waters of the Niobrara , deep and dark under winter ice , until suddenly they broke out and flooded the willows and the lowlandsin a boiling , roaring flood of gray . But the boy remaineddark within himself to the end . And there were bad days for Ruedy , too , when despite all the urging of his son he would not read or play , and his words were rare as the August sprinkling of rain in the dust of a long drouth.  |p255By  fall Ward could ride a little on the tame old Prince pony of his childhood that had been browsing in Spring Slough for years . But any jerk or a touch of the saddlehorn doubled him up almost as though it were once more the night he rode slowly the long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father . Gradually he moved back to Slogum House and took up a portion of his work there , but he never spoke directly to Gulla for months , and almost every evening he rode the slow pony over the hogback to Ruedy 's shack , where Rene and Leo Platt stopped more and more often , and sometimes Moll Barheart too , on a new gray pony with a fine black tail that hung to the ground . The first time Libby saw Old Moll there the woman came riding over the bluff from the south with a grain sack balanced across her saddle , each end full of books , some of Ruedy 's she was returning , some of her own she was bringing , and it was with a sudden warmth in the palms of her hands that the daughter realized that this friendliness had been going on between the two for a long time , perhaps years . After that the girl spoke more freely to her father , with less embarrassment over the failure of his family to him , sometimeseven with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pleased that he had not lost all the cunning in those fingers that were so slender and fine in her childhood . Suddenly she remembered something else too : that those days along the river in Ohio were long ago , for she was now twentyeight . How strange it seemed . She felt no different than at twenty , or at seventeen . Perhaps not nearly so old as the time Gulla sent her to light Judson Pomroy to his bed at seventeen . But she knew what the years brought , for she saw it in Annette , only twenty-six and her dresser already a forest of creams , lotions , skin foods , liquid powders , bleaches , neck and arm vibrators , and bust developers . The girl read articles on beauty and youth between books on white slavery , such as From Dance Hall to Hell . And already her eyes were seeking out the smooth-cheeked boys of the hay crew in Lower Slogum . The years were a little easier on Cellie , complacent , plump as a goose-feather pillow , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her skirts . She would have a light moustache too , after a while , and already a downiness sat before her ears that gathered the whiteness of her face powder . Cellie preferred Bertha M. Clay and Charles Garvice to the white-slave exposes and waited for the Comfort every month . By now her admirers were mostly men who were ready to settle down . They sent her sets of slushy picture postcards for her album , one a day , and wanted to get married . One of them left her half a section of land near Fairhope when he died , and she was touched and a little sorry that she could n't marry him . It might have been nice , having her own home and all . As Libby thought of these things , Ruedy , forty-eight to-day , was playing Old Country songs for Moll Barheart . Together they sang one , a sad , tragic duet , very dolorously , in halting German , and then they even yodeled a little , very badly , Leo Platt tapping his foot and Rene looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , palms together , before him . From his watch pocket hung a horsehair fob , made from the tail trimmings of his prize-winning Percheron stud . Libby was glad to see that these friends of Ruedy 's accepted her at last , after the trying time of Ward 's recovery , when Rene , anxious for news of Ruedy 's beloved son , had to learn not to turn from the door if the daughter of Slogum House opened it . And Platt too , who seemed content now with his little place on the Niobrara , his own light bread , and his battles for the rights of the homeseekers . But sometimes Libby felt his storm-gray eyes upon her , and then she always said something , anything , very quickly to the others.  |p257And  to-night , when they scattered into the night , Platt walked beside Libby through the light of the fading moon that was dusted by rags of flying clouds . Silent , he crossed the hogback beside her , the tall sparse grass along the path brushinghis pants . At the gate he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Ruedy 's , the girl looking after him long after he was lost in the night . And when the whiteness of dawn spread upward in the east and the familiar things of her room came out of the blackness , Libby was still remembering that Leo Platt 's step was hers , exactly hers.  |p258ROOSEVELT  'S order that the fences around all government land in the nation must come down was spread across all the larger newspapers of the country and condemned as persecution , the Cattleman Inquisition . But to the land-hungry of all the world it was the opening of a new continent , the discovery of a new America . They talked of it in crossroad post offices , in village streets , in smoky saloons , in metropolitan flop houses , and in the desolate queues of the unemployed . In far lands they talked of it as they straightened their weary backs in the fields or the forests of others and as they sat over the black bread and coffee , over the spaghetti , the cabbage soup , or the watered vin rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty by another  --  these figures meant little , but here and there these cattle empires were translated into acres . Then the forty-nine townships controlled by Pomroy of the Diamond B with his home ranch in a place called Dumur County became approximately one million acres of the earth 's surface . Greater than a barony or a duchy , greater perhaps than the Fatherland itself . Ach , yes , such a thing was possible only in that far world of wonders , America . So the land-hungry rushed out to borrow money of maternal uncles , perhaps to sell the two-hundred-year-old clock or to waylay a neighbor with a club , and then to figure passage , look at time-tables . All over the country old wagons were being greased up for the long trails to the free land . And while the boomers sang " There ' 11 Be a Hot Time in the OldP259Town To-night , " on their way West , once more " Amneriha 's ' ein schones Land " rose lustily from optimistic throats across the long sea . With the news fresh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One third of the Diamond B was in Dumur County , much of it free land and well grassed . She would have more of that grass for the Slogums . But while the cattlemen were pleading in futile eloquence before the President that the removal of the fences meant range wars , it was reported that their financial connections used less public but more effective methods . Just when Gulla Slogum was ready to throw ten armed punchers and four thousand head of young stock into south Dumur County , the ranchers obtained a stay of a year and a half on the fence-removal order . Platt and his kind saw the delay coming , and anticipated the next fight , to keep the land from permanent leasing to the ranchers . Although the cattlemen had the money and the pull , the settlers had the votes , and so they carried petitions against the lease bill all over the fringe of the cattle country , sent them to Washington in rolls like rounds sawed off log ends , stitched tight in grain sacking and addressed on old fur-company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sponsored by a range-district Congressman , permitting homesteadsof six hundred forty acres , was passed . Platt brought the news to Spring Branch Canyon . With the fences coming down and the filings all four times as large as before , still at a fee of fourteen dollars , there would be a real boom , and probably more trouble with the ranchers . Because nothing much had come of all the excitement about the fraudulent filings , the cattlemen prepared to use the enlargedhomestead to cover the range country like drying soogans spread out around a sheep camp after a gullywasher . This time they planned what Gulla had been trying for years , to get the land patented as fast as possible and out of theP260hands of the government for all time . Cattleman land agents scoured the country for old soldiers ' widows whose husbands saw long military service , the whole time legally deductablefrom the required five-year residence period . Filing papers were made out at five dollars apiece for the widow , and twenty-five dollars or more for the land agent . The entryman'soath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dismissed as a mere formality . But it was not a mere formality to the serious homeseekers , who wanted to see what they were getting for their land rights . Weeks before the Kinkaid opening the sandhill region was busy as a new anthill . They came in by train and livery team , by covered wagon and afoot ; they hunted up locators or fell into the hands of those who passed as locators , often cattleman tools . The oilcloth-covered table at Slogum House doubled in length , with a sign , MEALS 50 CENTS , PAYABLE IN ADVANCE to all strangers . In addition Gulla kept three men with buggy teams ready to take the land seekers into the fringe of the hills , never far enough to catch a glimpse of the wide valleys where the horses ' hoofs resounded on the hard trails , or the meadows where the grass stood belly-deep by middle June . Instead the boomers saw only the deep sand , panting lizards , and the tall sparse bluestem shaking on the windy slopes that were too loose for bunchgrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the deep cups of the blowouts spreading yellow sand southeastwardin the wind . They discovered that the soft , blurred hills moved aside as the buggy approached ; they heard stories of men lost for weeks and found starving , crazy from the heat , or with hands and feet frozen . The homeseekers got these things at five dollars a day , also payable in advance . And three times a week Dodie made the round trip to the railroad with the double-seated spring wagon , taking the dis-P261appointed back to the depot at Fairhope and picking up a new supply of boomers at the station at Dumur . A week before the opening day Gulla let her two upstairs girls go to the little land-office town . They were going to fill out one of their homesteads apiece with three quarters more Kinkaid land anyway , and might as well make their expenses and have a little fun . Cellie and Annette went up too , in the red-wheeled buggy that had been Lancaster 's , to expand their filings and their acquaintance . By opening day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gambling houses , and women everywhere , a few with the downy faces and tired hands of refinementand a queer faith in their adequacy to life on a drylandgovernment claim . But most of the women , by far the most , were those who gather in the strange and far places where men go to escape life as it must be lived at home . Every foot of space was taken up by beds , cots , and floor pallets , and still there was not enough sleeping room under cover . Tents were pitched everywhere , and far out on the prairie the cool night was clotted with wagons and tipis and knots of men smoking about campfires ; here and there a woman with a crying baby on her arm , calling her straying brood loudly together or just standing back from the fire listening to the men , weary for a place to set her belongings down . The evening before the opening a long queue began to form outside the land office ; it lengthened all the night and into the bright , shimmering heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the night a calicoed woman brought her man a sandwich and a can of coffee , and , as he ate , those around him clamored for food to be brought from the restaurants or hamburger stands . Here and there another dug into his overalls for a dry , newspaper-wrapped slice of bread and meat ; some made tobacco do , adding to the line of drying splatters of brown beside them in the dust . Still others , with little over the fourteen-dollar filing fee , clung doggedly to their places , without food or water , against all offers to sell out , through the long night and the heat of the summer morning on the shimmering prairie . Just before the opening hour another line formed beside the first , ex-soldiers in uniform with their equipment and their discharge papers , rested , unhurried , joking , safe in the service man 's priority right . And when the land office finally opened , word got around that all the good claims were gone . Even the ex-soldiers , with their priority rights , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were a bunch of dirty , crooked bastards and only got a sound of laughing from the clerks until one little fellow in a ragged uniform and with a black patch over an eye took to waving his gun around . Then they were all rushed out and away by the deputies . All through the town the angry men told their story . So ?  --  And , by golly , it must be true or the government officials would n't ' ve run the soldiers out like they did . Wiping their wind-cracked mouths on the backs of their hands , the homeseekers saw what this meant . A few cursed themselves dry , damning the government , the cattlemen , the whole country , as graft-rotten . But most of them stood dark and silent , helpless in this lost hope of a livelihood , a home of their own , a piece of the earth at last . No one slept until after daylight . All night the saloons were packed with sullen men who threw their whiskey down anger-dusty throats , the light-squared street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Stetson in sight anywhere . The next morning the women of the tents and the covered wagons kept their children in and looked anxiouslyafter their menfolks as they gathered in low-talking knots on the main street . By now the homeseekers were certain they had been rimmed , P263those who had been in the country for ten years rimmed as surely if not as completely as the Eastern tenderfoot and the greenhorn from the Old Country who had sunk all they had in the long trip to the free land . For a long time no one could see how it had been done . Yesterday was the opening day . Everybody had been there since the night before . Then more rumors got around , rumors of baskets of cattleman filings entered weeks before the opening , all dated ahead . And as the rumor spread the men came to life as long still grass with a sudden wind upon it . They pushed their hats back and began to move upon the land-office building , one group after another , until the street was packed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they jerked up loose sidewalk boards , pulled up hitch racks and light posts . And as they moved on a low rumble of sound rose and spread over all the border town . Platt and several other locators from the south country were talking over yesterday 's discovery , trying to plan for their homeseekers , when the rising noise of the mob reached them . Jumping on the handiest horses , they cut up a side street to head them off , get between the armed deputies inside the land-office building and the push of the angry , landhungrymen , with nothing much but a few clubs and posts and empty fists against six-shooters and sawed-off shotguns . When the mounted locators appeared in the street before the roaring mob , those in front stopped in surprise and were jammed up against the horses by those behind . In that one moment of hesitation Leo Platt called upon old settlers among them , men he had known for years , some who got their first quarter of land through him ten , fifteen years before . This was damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only give the cattlemen a chance to report that the homeseekers were hoodlums , lawless , unfit to own land . Soldiers would come , not poor devils like those kicked out yesterday , their guns empty , honorable discharges useless in their pockets , but soldiers with loaded rifles and Gatling guns , martial law . Grudging agreement arose here and there , with loud protestsfrom strange throats :  --  " Pull him down ! " " He a sonabitch too , American sonabitch  --  " " Let me at the stinkin ' crook ! I ' 11 slough him ! " " Give him what the rest ' 11 get  --  He sold me out , sold us all out  --  " " Clean out the whole damn nest of rats  --  " Once more Platt held up his hand for silence , the other locators drawing their horses closer . And as he began to talk , his voice scarcely audible in the noise , somebody bawled out over it all , over all the town . " The bastard runs with them whorin ' Slogum women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray-white with anger . So , this was what they could say  --  and him busting a tug to help the damned fools . Well , let them go , let them get a bellyful of lead . But as he moved to rein away , he saw Pastor Zug in the crowd , a post held high in his two hands , the big man toweringout above all the rest , a ready target for the bullets from the waiting deputies . And only a cedar post in his hands . Once more the locator had to try to quiet the mob , urging his rearing horse forward for attention . " There ' s one man who wo n't sell the settler out  --  " he told them . " Old T. R. Petition him , let him know what ' s going on here , and he ' 11 tear up the earth  --  " " We want Debs  --  he ' s our man  --  " " Hell , yes , T. R. ' s in cahoots with the crooks  --  " " Then why did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs of the country against him ? The cattlemen had the land once , did n't they ? " Platt challenged them . P265Here and there face turned to face . Yes , that was right , damn right . But some were not yet content . " We ' re here , " they yelled . " We want our land now  --  " " An ' by God we ' 11 have it  --  " pushing forward once more , one or two waving old guns . But Platt stood against them now , firmly . " Keep straight on and you ' 11 get lead in your guts . There ' s a dozen armed deputies inside the windows there , and cases of shells . They ' 11 mow you down like grass before a new sickle . Forty , fifty of you ' 11 be kicking in the dust . " Kicking in the dust  --  That stopped them , made the mob waver , begin to crumble , to scatter , here and there a man looking back , not sure . Finally even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of the more violent hung about the landofficebuilding . But the deputies kept out of sight and at last these , too , went away to Platt 's wagon , where he was taking signers to a petition of complaint . A recorded entry was a recorded entry , he explained . All they could do now was to protest to Washington , demand an investigation , contest the cattleman filings at the end of the six months ' residence period . " The poor man shore catches nothing but hell in this world , " one homeseeker said sadly , as he made his mark . " Yes . Like eel fishers . In still waters they catch nothing , but if they thoroughly stir up the slime , their fishing is sometimesvery good  --  " a gray-haired man answered him as he signed the petition in a fine Spencerian hand . " A kicking mule gets attention , " said Old Moll . From her hotel room overlooking the main street , Gulla Slogum saw the scattering of the ex-soldiers , the gathering of the other homeseekers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they heard the story . Here and thereP266an old-timer leaned on his gun and spit into the furry dust at his feet . The goddamn , thieving cattleman tools ! All the night Gulla heard the unrest in the street , the noise of the saloons along the board walks , and in the hot yellow sun of morning she saw the swift gathering of the mob . And as the men pushed towards the land-office building , tearing up weapons as they went , she pulled at her loosening dewlap , satisfaction sitting in the corners of her wide , slitted mouth . Any trouble down there was just so many good eggs in her checkered apron . Then the locator from the Niobrara rode into eye-shot of the woman of Slogum House . Once more anger rose against him through all her thick body , and regret too , as she saw him scatter the muttering crowd . What could n't she do with a son like that ? Gulla 's entries seemed safe enough from all of Platt 's protestsand petitionings . With the government prosecutions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the Diamond B prepare for the big land opening . Through Annette , Gulla got her filings in early too , and properly post-dated . Otherwise they were legal enough , mostly the three quarter section entries of the family , filling out their Kinkaids . Characteristically , Ruedy took up the rest of Spring Branch Canyon , giving him the stream and the bald bluffs to Cedar Creek . Back at Slogum House from the Kinkaid opening , Gulla marked the better sections not too far beyond her south line fence with small red check marks . The petitions of Platt and the disappointed homeseekers would bring an investigation , probably wholesale cancellation of the fraudulent filings . Anyway , six months from now , when the Big Jackson and the rest of her early filings were safely patented , Gulla intended to begin contesting . She would have little to lose by then and a great deal of good land to gain . And over in Spring Branch Canyon Ruedy was tellingP267Libby of the trouble at the land office , and the part Leo took in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , pulling at the frayed bottoms of his overalls . All this time Gulla was not without concern for Fanny . It was fourteen years since she went from Oxbow Flat , three years since she finished at the conservatory , with a piano recitaland an exhibition of her art : water colors , painted satins , brass trays , and burnt wood . Long before this , the mother began to give the girl a picture of the Slogums of Dumur County . She felt it her painful mother 's duty , she wrote , to prepare this delicately reared daughter for the shocking differencebetween herself and her family , which existed in poverty , in an unpainted shack . She must be prepared to find her brothers day laborers , one sister a common cook , her father a shiftless failure who had to be kept by the rest and no comfortwhatever to his wife . She , Fanny , was the one flower of the thorny plant , the flower the mother had so carefully brought up to bear the name of Slogum in the high position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevate the family for her beloved daughter , but it was n't to be just yet . Until then her poor mother was making such preparations for her dear daughter 's future among her kind as she could . Gulla marshaled the more pathetic points of life in the West , with drouth and depression , into a letter to Miss Deane , asking her kind assistance to placing Miss Fanny in a fitting position for the present . Was it not possible for a young lady of her accomplishments to be placed with people of culture ? Evidently it was , because the next time Fanny wrote she was sailing for Europe as companion to a widow and teacher for her two daughters , twelve and fourteen . Several letters came from Europe , then nothing but notes for six months , and finally a hurried request for money , two hundred dollars ,   to be sent general delivery to a little town in Vermont . After that there was another lapse and then a contrite note , saying she had been out of work and ill but everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by way of evidence she sent Gulla a garnet brooch . For the last year the letters were regular enough , although the address was always changing . " Mrs. Easterson travels a great deal , " Fanny explained . And so it seemed . Miss Fanny Slogum , care of Mrs. W. K. Easterson , the letters postmarkedNew York , Atlantic City , Chicago , St. Louis for the World 's Fair , once even Niagara Falls . Gulla opened that one with clumsy fingers . Perhaps Fanny was married , had made a good match . But it was only another note with a forwarding address at Toronto . Now nothing for almost two months . And then one day a livery team stopped in the Slogum yard with a slender woman whose waist measured no more than two good hand spans . She wore a modish dress of black and the long plume of her Merry-Widow hat swept from her foreheadaround the back and drooped over the opposite shoulder in a full , soft , curling tip . The livery man cramped the wheels , helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncertain , he turned around and drove away out across Oxbow Flat . The young woman lifted her heavy veil to consider the place , dropped it quickly , and , gathering up the rolling swirl of her braided skirt , swept up to the front entrance of Slogum House , although there was no longer even a path through the weeds . Gulla saw her come . Another straying woman who needed help . She patted her forearms and thought of the fee she would get now , with perhaps more , if there were good connections . . . . After several knocks , each more timid , Gulla finally sent the stammering Corrie out to bring the woman to the porchP269door , where she stood against her entrance with folded arms . And before her robust breadth the stranger , who seemed only a girl now , tried to speak in a low , hoarse , embarrassed voice , choked into a fit of coughing , and finally gave up to it . Squeezing her lace handkerchief to her lips , she held to the door casing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . The handkerchief she took from her lips and folded so quickly into her hand was flecked with clear , bright blood . So Fanny , youngest daughter of the Slogums , came home , and Dodie rode to Dumur for Dr. Hamlin , for much as Gulla hated him he was the nearest , and there seemed little time now . While the doctor was with the girl in Gulla 's room , the mother stalked up and down the dark hall , pulling at her drooping , grayish lip and folding and unfolding her arms on her stomach . When the doctor finally came out he was wiping his hands in cold disapproval . " Mrs. Slogum , " he said , " your place is a public menace . This is the fifth case of gonorrhoea I 've treated from here during the last six months  --  " The stocky woman did not retreat . " She  --  " pointing toward her own room  --  " she ca n't have it  --  why , she just came here . She never saw this house before to-day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do indeed draw the dregs of humanity . And regardless of when she came or how , she may never leave here alive . Her health has been seriously impaired by frequent abortions and venereal disease until now it ' s advanced consumption . " In the kitchen he gave Libby instructions about the pills and powders he was leaving and the food the patient should have  --  milk , meat , fruit , and especially eggnog , plenty of eggnog , made with whiskey . When Libby told him of Gulla 's specific orders against intoxicating liquor in the house the doctor yanked at his beard . " She ' s a fine one to moralize ! I ' m sending it out to-morrow by the mail carrier . You have my instructions . " Before he left the yard he went to the windmill to wash his hands again . A long time he let the cold stream of water run over them , over the backs and the palms and well between the fingers . Fanny spoke even less than Libby , and only gradually did the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . When Annette saw the fragile hands , the transparent whiteness of the narrow , childish face , and the soft , light brown curls about the girl 's damp forehead , she saw herself for what she was , thirty and coarsening and faded . Something of the hundred vigorous years of the Grossrnutter ran like a fine steel wire through all the children of Ruedy . Despite the doctor 's angry pessimism , in a month Fanny was hungry and wanting to get up . So after supper Libby climbed the path over the hogback to Spring Branch Canyon . Rene was there and she let him talk of his horses , each one as complex as any human being to him and worth many more words . Now he was adding a Morgan stud to cross with the range mares , produce fine all-around light horses , tough animals , with spirit and beauty . It was good to see him so . Finally Rene lifted his thickening body and went away into the darkness , leaving Libby and Ruedy alone . A long time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covertly , so the man could not know . He was sitting under the old Swiss clock that had passed down through the Ruedy sons so long as there were any , and from them to the Slogums . It had come to Spring Branch a month ago , the only notice , beside the black-bordered card , that the last William Penn Slogum was dead . Libby watched her father , seeing , always with a new shock , how thin and stooped Ruedy 's shoulders were , how gray the stubbles on his lean and seamed face . And yet , for all theP271years and the humiliation of his life , there was peace somewherewithin him . Like the quiet of Spring Branch Canyon , somehow there was still peace deep in the tortured fissures of his life . But she had come to tell him of Fanny . He listened gravely , without a word , and when she was done he still sat silent , his hands hanging limp between his knees , remembering the light-haired little girl who went away . Finally he got up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door into the unleavened darkness where a prairie-dog owl called far off in the hills and the windmill at Slogum House squeaked for grease . At last he returned to his chair . " You ' d think , " he said , " that a man would use as much sense with his family as Rene does with his stock . If a stud , horse gets poor colts , he do n't let him go on indefinitely  --  " Since Gulla showed her ranching ambitions so plainly her freighting trade had fallen off until there was only business enough for one girl , and that only by working the community on the side . Not that Gulla , even now , let her bring outside customers to the house , but there were always buggies and buggy robes . Libby complained a little to her father . Gulla was getting old . Even with her disappointment in Fanny it was n't like her to be so careless , letting her upstairs girls lay out . What was the difference in places ? Ruedy asked . The race had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the first time he left Libby sitting while he went out to dig at the wheat grass creeping in at the gardens , chopping at the tough roots as long as there was any light at all . And still he had to think of the boy that let one of River Haber 's daughters lead him into the bushes . With business permanently slack , Gulla told Eulie , the less profitable one of the upstairs girls , to go . But Eulie did n't want to . She had been with the Slogums for years . It was the nearest thing to home she had ever known . Could n't she just help around the place for a while , for her keep ? To learn a few things , she said , shaking her bushy yellow head and giggling . She might want to set up housekeeping some day . Lots of young fellows in the country looking for a cook . Libby laughed . That yellow fuzz-top learn anything ? She did n't want her in the kitchen at all , falling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles off the cups , hair in the butter . Anyway , Libby said she was particularwhose hands went into her food . That Eulie was probablyrotten with disease . But the girl cried and so Gulla told her she could wait . When Dr. Hamlin came through the yard on his way to set the leg of one of the Diamond B 's dude cowpunchers , she let Eulie run out to talk to the doctor . Quitting business and wanted to get out even with the board , the girl told the doctor . So he came in . When he was leaving Libby stopped him . " I ' 11 have to look her over again in a few weeks ; nothing now , " he told her . " Nothing at all ? " Libby asked , with the skepticism of her kind for all the Eulies . But finally she let the girl come into the kitchen so long as she wore a crocheted cap over her frizzy hair . That chippy ' d get tired of working soon enough , she told the worried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bake pies that were almost as flaky as Libby 's . She had a light touch with the biscuits and could even , come butchering time , boil up a batch of lye soap the color of ivory and light enough to float . She got up at the first clink of her bell and did whatever was set out for her . Sometimes Libby wondered at the change in this girl who used to sleep until noon and could scarcely be madeP273to wash out her own pants . Then gradually she saw what the girl was after . Cash Slogum . Not just Cash to sleep with , but to marry . The day after Gulla saw it Eulie of the yellow hair was gone . It happened easy enough , without fuss . Gulla asked her along to Dumur to open the gates . In town she gave the girl a letter to one of Dolly 's friends , married and living in a fine , big house overlooking Rapid City . The woman was easygoing , soft as a rabbit , and would be mighty glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get Eulie there and quite a little over for clothes . But the girl threw the whole thing to the walk at Gulla 's broad feet , much as she herself once threw ten dollars through a Slogum window . To hell with her dirty money , got by murder and worse ! Little Eulie had plenty , she bragged , lifting her skirt and showing a thick , flat roll in her stocking . And when there was only the lean , , grinning mouth of Gulla the girl began to cry , the white powder of her face wrinkling , her eyelashes running . " Oh , you can throw me out , you old mud-faced heifer , you ! " she bawled for all the street to hear . " But you ca n't keep me out . Cash ' 11 be after me and you ' 11 be damn glad to have me back . " But Gulla was already at her buggy . Unwrapping the lines from the whipstock , she drove away , out of town , leaving the money on the walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt and tuck it in with the rest . That evening Cash came in early and looked all around the kitchen and the dining rooms . But he did n't say anything , not until he sat down beside his mother at the supper table . Then he leaned over her shoulder , his little yellow-gray eyes scared and mean . " What did you do with her ? " he demanded . P274But the mother was talking to Hab on the other side and so Cash had to wait until the house was still and Gulla was in her room . " You got to get her back  --  I tell you , you got to get her back . " The woman looked up from the twenty-dollar deduction in her black book to the broad , sullen face of her son standing in the door . Then she dipped her pen and went on writing , addingthe few receipts of the day . But when Cash still did n't go she put her pen down , locked the desk door on the book , and came toward him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've put up with enough foolishness from you , Cash Slogum , with your rascally goings-on . And now you ' re trying to tell me what to do , you whore chaser , rotten with the clap this very minute ! " But it was only a checked apron in the face of an angry longhorn to Cash . The Haber in his wide jaw came out . " By God , you ca n't run me all my life like you do the rest  --  " " I ' 11 run you because you ca n't run yourself ; because you ' re a fool and a sneaking coward  --  " " Like hell I ' m a coward  --  I ai n't afraid of you ! " he roared , his voice loud in the still house as he pulled a revolver from his pocket and , waving it before her , was big with courage . For a moment Gulla hesitated , a sagging and a grayness in her heavy face . And then it was gone . Cash was only a Slogum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she had done away with Butch . He even threw it up to her , when he was drunk , staggering home from the Willow . " No , you ai n't afraid , " the woman said softly , her eyes almostlost under the dark-fleshed rolls of her brows , " and Butch was n't afraid  --  and where is he now ? " Slowly she moved toward this son , and before her heavy approach he let the gun waver , drop , let the woman take it , break it , spillp275the shells into her palm and hold the empty weapon out to him , as she might the club to a whipped dog to lick . Two weeks later the deputy sheriff stopped in on his way back to Dumur from the hills . County Attorney Cudder wanted to see Gulla and Cash about the disappearance of a man named Butch . Nothing serious ; just a little questioning . The mother and son sat dark and strange beside each other all the way up to Dumur . Cash drove , handing the lines to Gulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were through , driving on again . Several times he tried to speak , not . of the day 's difficulties , but a friendly word , about ordinarythings , like the field of golden Susans along the road where a strip of ploughing was going back to grass , a coyotey team of bronchs hitched to an old top buggy they passed , the box-elder bugs that dropped into their laps somewhere in the Niobrara Valley . But when he turned to speak the stoniness of the woman beside him stopped his tongue . So he touched up the horses , and as they quickened their pace the saddle horse of the deputy sheriff beside them lifted his tail , let go a little wind , and trotted faster too . In the county attorney 's office they found Eulie waiting in a new red dress with bandings of black ribbon , her yellow hair more burnt and frizzy . When Cash came in she started up towards him , but before Gulla 's cold black eyes she got only a mumbled " Hello . " County Attorney Cudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat behind his desk , swivel chair tilted back , his smoothface pink , his plump finger tips together before him . To one side was the deputy sheriff , and before him in a semicircle he had Eulie , Cash , and Gulla ; only the girl confident , her knees crossed , snapping and unsnapping the top of her black silk bag . From the moment of the Slogums ' entry the man played them against each other . Gulla 's cunning little eyes saw
