China entered the New Year boldly last week , put into effect without warning a new tariff estimated to increase the living costs of foreigners in China by 30% . <P> They will have to pay dear for whiskey , wines , silks , jewelry and beer . The tariff on imported cigarets was upped some 600% , should prove prohibitive to all except Americans who must have Camels , Luckies etc. ; Englishmen who must have Players , Abdullas . With great astuteness the Chinese Government upped their tariff so suddenly that the " foreign devils " had no chance to lay in advance supplies of their necessities - luxuries to Chinamen . <P> Naturally most of the foreign devils and all foreign correspondents were furious . An exception was U. S. Commercial Attache Julean Arnold ( he and other diplomatic folk can import their luxuries duty free ) . With admirable tact Mr. Arnold pointed out that China has only recently come to the end of a period of customs tutelage by the Great Powers . For some 80 years they held her down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Nationalist Government has squirmed out from under this galling yoke , China might reasonably be expected to do much worse than she did last week - especially as in Oriental lands taxation is usually based upon no other consideration than what the traffic will bear . <P> " The new tariff act , " declared Attache Arnold impressively , " indicates more consideration of China 's economic condition than has any previous tariff legislation in China 's history . The new tariff is calculated on a genuine protection theory , and not merely to increase revenue . " <P> China 's cigaret industry will chiefly receive protection , the foreign cigaret being virtually excluded , the foreign tobacco leaf continuing to enter under relatively trifling duty . <P> Enter Canada . Wheat and flour , necessities of the Chinese masses , continue to enter China free. * Tremendous was the sensation in Vancouver , Canada , last week when the Vancouver Province " revealed " that : <P> " The Hon. Herbert M. Marler , head of Canada 's embassy to the orient , has been sent to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely possible that , arising from his visit , Canada will sell 100,000,000 bushels of wheat . . . . <P> " Behind the wheat deal is a great project , initiated by the Hon. H. H. Stevens , Canada 's Minister of Trade &; Commerce , for the granting of a $1,000,000,000 loan to China , designed to reinstate the values of silver all through the orient and finally to place China on her feet so completely that she will become a huge and profitable market for British , Canadian and American goods . <P> " The Hon. R. B. Bennett Prime Minister of Canada , has merely hinted at the giant plan in hand . . . intimated that some credit arrangement might have to be made to enable China to buy Canadian wheat in large quantities . He has not attempted to outline the very interesting and stupendous plan which is now being discussed in London , New York , Washington and Ottawa for the rehabilitation of silver and the general reorganization of oriental trade and markets .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
