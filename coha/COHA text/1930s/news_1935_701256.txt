txt Declaring that President Roosevelt is planning to move for an amendment of the Constitution for social and economic powers , Midwest Republicans in their " Grass Roots " conference today appealed to the country to uphold the fundamental law against " invasion of State 's rights and individual liberty . " The chief issues for 1936 , as they forecast them , will be orderly economic government and preservation of the Constitution . In defiant speeches , the Republicans , representing ten States and meeting in surroundings of Lincoln traditions , pledged the Republican party to rally to save the Constitution from " the encroachments of the New Deal experiments . " They denounced these theories as working against restoration of prosperity . In a singing and cheering mood , the gathering applauded a demand for a campaign in 1936 based on " strict adherence to the Constitution , a sound-money policy and a balanced Federal budget to stay excessive taxation . " Lowden Calls for Rattle Former Governor Frank 0 . Lowden of Illinois , the white-haired favorite in the Farm Belt , as the keynote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from morning until late tonight other speakers and the members of the resolutions committee carried out his theme . The party must fight , they said , to preserve the balance of power between the Federal and State Governments . Mr. Lowden vigorously criticized the Roosevelt policies and asserted that there was no need to revise the Constitution . Appeals for the Republican party to follow the lead of its first President and work against modification of the Constitution were voiced by John D. Hamilton , Republican National Committeeman from Kansas , who was chosen as permanent chairman ; Harrison E. Spangler , National Committeeman from Iowa , and Mrs. George B. Simmons , a farmer 's wife of Marshall , Mo . The latter was applauded vigorously as she told of her trials under the New Deal program . Late tonight the conference adopted resolutions indicting the Roosevelt administration and citing instances of alleged waste and illconceived legislation . This action is to be followed tomorrow by a declaration of principles to remedy present conditions " without breaking down the Constitution . " The conference represents more than one-fifth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful that its declaration of principles will be accepted by the East and that the entire Republican party will be impelled to assume a fighting attitude against the Roosevent administration in 1936 . Leaders responsible for the meeting confidently hope the work of the conference will arouse Republicans elsewhere to become aggressive and influence deserters to return to the party in 1936 . These leaders assert that unless the conservatives of the nation adopt the " Grass Roots " program of attack , the 1936 Presidential election will go by default to Mr. Roosevelt . The conference met in the Coliseum at the Fair Grounds , with more than 5,000 delegates in attendance . Early in the day a thunderstorm broke and it was reported that hundreds of farmers were un- able to reach the city . Tonight nearly 7,000 delegates and guests crowded into the Coliseum , while as many more heard the proceedings from the outside through loudspeakers . National committeemen of the East were conspicuous by their absence from the group of committeenien of the so-called rural and progressive section seated on the stage . Former Senator Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cld Guard on the rostrum . Other party advisers there were Arthur M. Hyde , R. B. Craeger , committeeman of Texas ; George W. Getz , treasurer of the national committee ; Mrs. Kennedy Brown of Ohio , Mrs. F. G. Tallman , former Senators Glenn and Deneen , former Governor Louis L. Emmerson of Illinois and Percy W. Howard . Mrs. Mary C. Booze , committee member from Mississippi , represented the South . As Mr. Lowden defined the issues for 1936 and denounced the Roosevelt administration , his audience responded with loud and prolonged applause . Lowden Sees " Grave Crisis . " " I measure my words when I say that no crisis so grave as the present has confronted the American people since that unhappy cm , ; het ( the Civil War ) . for now , as them the essentials of our form of government are being challenged in high places , " he said . Shouts of " Yes , yes , we will fight as then , " came from the galleries and from the floor of the Coliseum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proletarian in the United States , " he declared amid cheers . " However humble the worker may be today , his child tomorrow may belong to what they call the capitalistic class , and no matter how proud the affluent member of that class may be today . his children tomorrow may be working with their hands , and without , thank God , losing caste or hope . " He proclaimed that the cornerstone of the American Government was the division of power between the States and the central government . This principle has stood . he said , for a century and a half and has been applauded by the world . It is now proposed " to strike down once and for all the great principle , " he added . He insisted that local self-government knows the needs of the community better than a Federal Government . " Substitute for the official chosen out of its own membership by itself a bureaucrat sent by Washington , " he said , " and you have destroyed the very basis of local self-government . " The American Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles laid down in the Bill of Rights , he asserted . The Constitution is sound simply because it recognizes and gives expression to these fundamentals of human rights . Constitution Is Worth Saving . " The Constitution is worth preserving , not to vindicate the fame of its founders , but for its intrinsic worth . " he went on . " Now , if an amendment can be used to . nullify a decision of the Supreme Court upon a fundamental matter in one case , why can it not be employed in another ? And so , in my opinion , the Bill of Rights is in jeopardy if the proposed amendment should prevail . In fact , if this assault upon the fundamentals of the Constitution should succeed , I can think of nothing that finally would be left of that great document except the provision that no State should be deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its consent . This , and only this , I think would be secure . " Giving his views of the stand the Republican party should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said : " The preservation of the basic principles of the Constitution : This is the supreme issue of the hour . We may have faith that other problems , pressing though they be , will find a proper solution if we maintain the essentials of government . Upon this great issue the Republican party must take the lead . It Would be false to its traditions and its history if it faltered now . Minor and factional and sectional differences must disappear . It must draw to its standards all those , of whatever political faith , who believe in the form of government established by the fathers and sanctified by the blood of patriots on a thousand battlefields . Democratic Defections Forecast . " Long ago an eminent American called our government an ' indissoluble union of indestructible States . ' The Republican party , under the leadership of Abraham Lincoln , made the first half of this statement come true . The Union was not dissolved . And men North and South now rejoice that this is so . But the task it undertook then is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment of the Constitution , to test the latter half of that statement . Are the States Indestructible ? Around that issue the battle rages . And I have faith that when the peopl have spoken we shall still have an ' indissoluble Union of indestructible States . ' " Departing from his prepared Speech , Mr. Lowden predicted that Democrats next year would follow the advice of Stephen A. Douglas , made during the Civil War period , and vote the Republican ticket to uphold the Constitution . The fight , he said , in 1936 would be to " uphold the democracy of Lincoln and Jefferson and all liberty-loving people , " The keynote address followed a severe arraignment of the administration by Harrison Spangler . Mr. Spangler acted as temporary chairman and at the outset roused the audience by his attack on the President . in which he charged violation of pledges to reduce government expenses , to balance the budget and to maintain a sound currency , and failure to continue the civil service system . " The issue today is individualism against regimentation ; liberty against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lincoln against those of Franklin Delano Roosevelt . " he declared " This is the challenge of the hour . This is the call to arms to the American people . " " Court Rebuked Roosevelt . " The audience rose and sang " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " Referring to the Supreme Court decision on the NRA , he said : " That sturdy court , composed of I liberals and conservatives alike , containing men appointed by five Presidents , selected on their distinguished records for wisdom , for courage and patriotism , has rebuked Mr. Roosevelt and told him and the New Deal party in no uncertain language that the American Eagle , and not the Blue Eagle , still soars aloft , keeping its watchful eye over the liberties of a hundred and thirty million people . " Lusty cheers greeted this . " The President and his advisers , " he went on , " having forgotten the campaign pledges of the Democratic party , began a wild orgy of experimentation . " " Leading legal minds in the Democratic party " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , he said . " Heedlessly they proceeded under the advice of Frankfurter lawyers , only to waste two years of precious time when the country languished in distress . " Continuing his indictment of the administration , he declared : - The sanctity of contracts has been denied ; the dollar has been debased ; an orgy of waste and extravagance has prevailed ; business and industry have been hobbled and obstructed ; the government has boycotted its own citizens . " Future Clouded , Says Spangler . " The way is being paved , " he asserted , " for an inflation , not only of credit but of currency , to a degree which is unpredictable , if not in fact uncontrollable . Over the possible resumption of industry and the quickening of human endeavor there hang the clouds of fear for undisclosed and more radical schemes ; the mena-ze of confiscation ; the thre-t of more government ccemetitien : the daily poesibility of further debeeement of our money . " The White House has heroine the centre of uncertainty and unsettlement from which may be issued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will throw whole industries , the market for our goods or the condition of living into further confusion . " The President is determined , he charged , to make permanent laws which were presented as temporary and needed to meet an emergency , and at the same time is reaching out for more power . Mr. Hamilton carried on the attacks tonight . He declared that the Republican party would defend the Constitution and human and property rights . Touching on the farm problem , he contended that as long as there was a protective tariff there must be some system to put the farmer on a parity with the industrialist . The same program was advanced by Mr. Lowden , Neither of them offered a substitute for the AAA laws . Danger to Agriculture Seen . The administration program , Mr. Hamilton said , was leading to imports of agricultural products and robbing this country of its export markets . " If this continues we are in dire danger of becoming an agricultural importing nation , which can but mean the ultimate destruction of agriculture as it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a constitutional amendment , he said : " If it be deemed to be reactionary to protest the abandonment of the Constitution  --  if it is reactionary to assert that it shall not be weakened by experimentation or indirect attack , then we of the Republican faith must bear that stigma , because our party is bound in honor to reaffirm its allegiance to the Con-nine-el of the Ue ! ed Ste tee . " From the events of the last two years it must now be plain that the President is in fact more interested in the recent language of the Supreme Court denying the right of Congress to delegate to him the powers of dictatorship than anything that has been . written concerning the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution . " Now that the issue is in the open , we also need no longer resort to pussyfooting terms when we speak of those who , under the subterfuge of emergency , have deliberately from the first planned a permanent State bureaucracy . This nation can thank God that in this hour of peril for American democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities above political opportunism and have an honest regard for their oaths to support the Constitution . " Platform Planks Suggested . Although declaring that the conference could not bind the Republican party to any platform prior to the national convention , he suggested these planks for consideration of the convention : " A pledge to stabilize the monetary system and to restore confidence in government credit by a balanced budget . " A repudiation of laws fostering monopoly . " Adoption of a policy calculated to take the government out of business . " A return to the people of their constitutional rights and particularly the maintenance in full vigor of the separate branches of the government . " A social program to meet every reasonable obligation of the national government to its citizens including a recognition of its duties to those in distress . " Continuing . he said : " In connection with this last proposal , may I presume to suggest as one of the planks of our next platform , ' governmental relief must be fres from political corruption ' ? Possibly that will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suggestion will at least be a novel one to them . " The Republican party is not dead , he declared , pointing to its 13,000 , - 000 votes in the last election . " Practical leadership , honesty of purpose , the courage and the will to fight , coupled with an equal appeal to the common sense and patriotism of our people , can once again elevate the Republican party to the place where it rightly belongs as the dominant party of this nation , " he concluded . The convention took a recess shortly before 1 o'clock and an ' hour later the delegates gathered around the tomb of Lincoln , where Mr. Hyde , Secretary of Agriculture in the Hoover Cabinet , made an address . Mr. Hyde urged Republican voters to support the pleas of con-1 ference speakers against revision of the Constitution . " In this , another great crisis in the life of America , " he said , " we have instinctively turned our feet to the last resting place of Lincoln , here to take common counsel , here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very foundations of this nation , ' conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , ' are being challenged , we shall not fail . " Other nations may take such action as fits their character . We do not envy and we shall not ape them . They may abandon liberty and fly to dictatorship . " We do not join Mr. Roosevelt in his admiration of the ' powers of Mussolini , Hitler or Stalin . We would first of all preserve liberty . Opportunism Is Decried . " They tell us that we shall write a platform which will outdeal the New Deal . Is there a man here who believes Lincoln would have accepted such counsel of crass opportunism ? They tell us that we should set up a coalition party to combat the sabotage of free government . Would not Lincoln tell us to declare first of all what is eternally right , and let support gather about the right because it is right ? " They tell us that the party of Lincoln , in defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be weak and powerless before an opposition which is entrenched behind billions of dollars of the people 's savings ; fortified behind a nation-wide Tammany Hall served by hundreds of thousands of paid henchmen . " During the recess the resolutions committee met and heard the grass root politicians advance different ideas for a declaration of principles . Mrs. Simmons , the Missouri farm woman whose speech evoked applause in the conference . said in one part of her attack on the adminis-tration : " I did not feel any happier after President Roosevelt stood up before that hand-picked bunch of farmers that so wrongly claimed to represent all farmers and called me a ' high and mighty liar , ' for I am one who does not believe that some softhanded fathead down in Washington can run my husband 's farm better than he can . " If Franklin D. Roosevelt is reelected in 1936 it will be the nearly five billion of dollars that will elect him and not the faith of the people . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
