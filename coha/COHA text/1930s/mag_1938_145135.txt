Husky Nancye Wynne went to bed for 24 hours , then lumbered out to limber her muscles on Manhattan 's River Club court . Her compatriot , 19-year-old John Bromwich , Australia 's either-handed , both-handed tennis topnotcher , wandered around Broadway until sheer ennui forced him to do a little volleying on an indoor court . Blond Sidney Wood , Wimbledon winner in 1931 who has been trying for a comeback this summer after two years of minding his nuggets in a California gold mine , visited his relatives in Manhattan . California 's Alice Marble , U. S. women 's champion two years ago , was a house guest of the Socialite Gilbert Kahns at Oyster Bay , Long Island . Little Sarah Palfrey Fabyan , twinkle-toed Bostonian , sat around at the Forest Hills Inn drinking tea . California 's Donald Budge , world 's No. 1 amateur tennist , and his square-headed shadow , Doubles Partner Gene Mako , spent their days at the movies and listening to swing bands . <P> Thus did the semifinalists in the U. S. Singles tennis championships ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week while an unprecedented rainy spell held up the semi-finals at Forest Hills for six days . As jittery contestants champed at the bit , U. S. tennis fans mused over nine days of the dullest top-flight tennis since women played in ankle-length flannel skirts and panama hats . <P> Men 's Final . When the skies cleared and the semi-finals were finally resumed , even the most disappointed fans turned up at Forest Hills once more to see whether Sidney Wood , who has stood out in bas-relief against the current U. S. crop of temperamental young tennists this summer , could extend Defending Champion Donald Budge and become the first player to take a set from him . Even that was disappointing . Budge annihilated Wood , 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-3 , in a match almost as unexciting as the other semi-final in which his doubles partner , Budapest-born Gene Mako , unseeded because of insufficient singles play , pricked the big Bromwich bubble , 6-3 , 7-5. 6-4 . For the first time since the Tilden-Hunter final in 1929 , a pair of U. S. doubles champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 Tilden beat Hunter . Last week Budge followed suit-but not before dropping a set to his crony , 6-3 , 6-8 , 6-2 , 6-1 - and thereby accomplished what no other tennist had ever done : won the Big Four championships of the world ( Australian , French , English , U. S. ) in one year . <P> Women 's Final . On the distaff side , the semi-final between Alice Marble ( seeded second to Helen Jacobs ) and crafty Sarah Palfrey Fabyan made up for the lacklustre men 's matches . Playing her usual powerful but erratic game , onetime Champion Marble twice came within a point of defeat before taking the match , 5-7 , 7-5 , 7-5 . Next day , playing against Nancye Wynne , 21-year-old Melbourne stenographer who had beaten California 's Dorothy Bundy on her way to the final , Alice Marble needed just 22 minutes to win the championship , 6-0 , 6-3 . <P> Looking forward to next year , when 23-year-old Donald Budge will probably follow Bill Tilden , Ellsworth Vines and Fred Perry into professional tennis ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the amateur game .
