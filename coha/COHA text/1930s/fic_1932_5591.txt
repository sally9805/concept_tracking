Illustration : " Be still ! The power of Liane is absolute here ! " Priestess of the Flame By Sewell Peaslee Wright * * * * * Sidenote : Commander John Hanson recounts the extraordinary story of Liane , Priestess of the Flame . I have been rather amused by the protests which have come to me regarding the " disparaging " comments I have made , in previous tales of the Special Patrol Service , regarding women . The rather surprising thing about it is that the larger proportion of these have come from men . Young men , of course . Now , as a matter of fact , a careful search has failed to reveal to me any very uncomplimentary remarks . I have suggested , I believe , that women have , in my experience , shown a sad lack of ability to understand mechanical contrivances . Perhaps I have pictured some few of them as frivolous and shallow . If I have been unfair , I wish now to make humble apology . I am not , as some of my correspondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember his youth . I remember it very well indeed , else these tales would not be forthcoming . And women have their great and proper place , even in a man 's universe . Some day , perhaps , the mood will seize me to write of my own love affair . That surprises you ? You smile to think that old John Hanson , lately a commander of the Special Patrol Service , now retired , should have had a love affair ? Well , ' t was many years ago , before these eyes lost their fire , and before these brown , skinny hands wearied as quickly as they weary now .... But I have known many women -- good women and bad ; great women and women of small souls ; kindly women , and women fierce as wild bears are fierce . Divinity has dealt lavishly with women ; has given them an emotional range far greater than man 's . They can sink to depths unknown to masculinity ; they can rise to heights of love and sacrifice before which man can only stand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman -- one of those no man could know and not remember . I make no apologies for her ; I pay her no homage . I record only a not inaccurate account of an adventure of my youth , in which she played a part ; I leave to you the task of judging her . * * * * * We were some three days out from Base , as I recall it , on a mission which promised a welcome interlude in a monotonous sequence of routine patrols . I was commander then of the Ertak , one of the crack ships of the Service , and assisted by the finest group of officers , I believe , that any man ever had under him . I was standing a watch in the navigating room with Hendricks , my junior officer , when Correy brought us the amazing news . Correy was my first officer , a square-jawed fighting man if one ever breathed , a man of action , such as these effete times do not produce . His eyes were fairly blazing as he came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grim line . " What 's up , Mr. Correy ? " I asked apprehensively . " Trouble aboard ? " " Plenty of it , sir ! " he snapped . " A stowaway ! " " A stowaway ? " I repeated wonderingly . A new experience , but hardly cause for Correy 's obvious anger . " Well , send him below , and tell Miro to put him to work -- the hardest work he can find . We 'll make him --  " " Him ? " blurted Correy . " If it were a him it would n't be so bad , sir . But it 's a she ! " * * * * * To understand the full effect of the statement , you 'd have to be steeped in the traditions of the Service . Women are seldom permitted on board a ship of the Service ; despite their many admirable qualities , women play the very devil with discipline . And here were we , three days out from Base on a tour of duty which promised more than a little excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mouth set grimly . " Where is she , Mr. Correy ? " I asked quietly . " In my quarters , under guard . It was my watch below , as you know , sir . I entered my stateroom , figuring on catching forty winks , and there she was , seated in my big chair , smiling at me . " Well , for a second I could n't speak . I just stared at her , and she kept smiling back at me . ' What are you doing here ? ' I managed to ask her , at last . ' Do you know where you are ? ' " ' I 'll talk to your commanding officer , ' she told me , cool as you please . ' Will you bring him , please ? ' " ' You 'll see him plenty soon enough , ' I snapped at her , getting over my surprise somewhat by that time . I called in a couple of men to keep her from getting into mischief , and reported to you . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering . From Correy 's account , she must be a rather remarkable person . " Bring her up here , if you will , Mr. Correy . I 'd like to see her before we put her in the brig . " The brig , I might explain , was a small room well forward , where members of the crew were confined for discipline . " Right , sir ! " It seemed to me that there was a peculiar twinkle in Correy 's eyes as he went out , and I wondered about it while we waited for him to return with the prisoner . " What an infernal nuisance , sir ! " complained Hendricks , looking up from his glowing charts . " We 'll be the laughing-stock of the Service if this leaks out ! " " When it leaks out , " I corrected him glumly . I 'd already thought of the unpleasant outcome he mentioned . " I 'll have to report it , of course , and the whole Service will know about it . We 'll just have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was still another possibility which I did n't mention : the silver-sleeves at Base would very likely call me on the carpet for permitting such a thing to happen . A commander was supposed to be responsible for everything that happened ; no excuses available in the Service as it was in those days . * * * * * I scowled forbiddingly as I heard Correy open the door ; at least I could make her very sorry she had selected the Ertak for her adventure . I am afraid , however , that it was a startled , rather than a scowling face to which she lifted her eyes . " This is the stowaway , sir , " said Correy briskly , closing the door . He was watching my face , and I saw , now , the reason for the twinkle in his eye when I mentioned placing the stowaway in the brig . The woman was startlingly beautiful ; one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen , and I have roamed the outer limits of space , and seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , gasped audibly as his eyes fell upon her . The stowaway was regally tall and exquisitely modeled . Her hair was the color of pale morning sunlight on Earth ; her eyes an amazing blue , the equal of which I have never seen . She was beautiful , but not coldly so . Despite her imperious bearing , there was something seductive about the soft curves of her beautiful body ; something to rouse the pulses of a man in the langour of her intensely blue eyes , and the full , sensuous lips , scarlet as a smear of fresh blood . " So this is the stowaway , " I said , trying to keep my voice coolly indifferent . " What is your name ? " " I should prefer , " she replied , speaking the universal language with a sibilant accent that was very fascinating , " to speak with you privately . " " You will speak with me , " I informed her crisply , " in the presence of these officers . I repeat : what is your name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am called Liane , " she said . " Chief Priestess of the Flame . Mother of Life . Giver of Death . I believe my name and position are not unknown to you , Commander Hanson ? " * * * * * Known to me ? If Base was not in error -- and for all their faults , the silver-sleeves are seldom wrong in matters of this sort -- this woman was the reason for our present mission . " They are known to me , " I admitted . " They do not explain , however , your presence here . " " And yet they should , " protested Liane gently . " I was taken from my own people by those who had no right to command me . I was subjected to the indignity of questioning by many men . I have merely taken the simplest and quickest way of returning to my own people . " " You know , then , our destination ? " " I was informed of that by those who questioned me , " nodded Liane . " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no prisoner , I secreted myself aboard the ship , hiding in a small room nearly filled with what I took to be spare parts . I had provisions , and a few personal belongings . When I felt sufficient time had elapsed to make a return improbable , I donned attire more fitting than the masculine workman 's guise in which I had secreted myself , and -- I believe you are acquainted with the remaining facts . " " I am . I will consider your case and advise you later . Mr. Correy , will you conduct the stowaway to my quarters and place her under guard ? Return when you have attended to this matter , and ask Mr. Kincaide to do likewise . " " To your quarters , you said , sir ? " asked Correy , his eyes very serious , but not sufficiently so to entirely disguise the twinkle in their depths . " Not to the brig ? " I could cheerfully have kicked him . " To my quarters , " I repeated severely , " and under guard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * While we were awaiting Correy and Kincaide , I briefly considered the rather remarkable story which had been told me at Base . " Commander Hanson , " the Chief of Command had said , " we 're turning over to you a very delicate mission . You 've proved yourself adept at handling matters of this kind , and we have every confidence you 'll bring this one to a highly successful conclusion . " " Thank you , sir ; we 'll do our best , " I had told him . " I know that ; the assurance is n't necessary , although I appreciate it . Briefly , here 's what we 're confronted with : " Lakos , as you know , is the principal source of temite for the universe . And without temite , modern space travel would be impossible ; we would have to resort to earlier and infinitely more crude devices . You realize that , of course . " Now , for some time , those in charge of operations on Lakos have complained of a growing unrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an alarming decrease in production . " It has been extremely difficult -- indeed , impossible -- to determine the reasons for this , for , as you are perhaps aware , the atmosphere of Lakos is permeated with certain mineral fumes which , while not directly harmful to those of other worlds , do serve to effectively block the passage of those rays of the sun which are essential to the health of beings like ourselves . Those in charge of operations there are supplied artificially with these rays , as you are in your ship , by means of emanations from ethon tubes , but they have to be transferred at frequent periods to other fields of activity . The constant shifting about produces a state of disorder which makes the necessary investigation impossible . Too , operations are carried on with an insufficient personnel , because it is extremely difficult to induce desirable types of volunteer for such disagreeable service . " We have , however , determined a few very important facts . This unrest has been caused by the activities of a secret organization or order known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation as I can give you . It sounds harmless enough , but from what we gather , it is a sinister and rather terrible organization , with a fanatical belief amounting , at times , to a veritable frenzy . These Lakonians are a physically powerful but mentally inadequate people , as perhaps you are aware . " The leader of this order or cult call it what you will -- seems to be a woman : a very fascinating creature , infinitely superior to her people as a whole ; what biologists call a ' sport , ' I believe -- a radical departure from the general racial trend . " This leader calls herself Liane , Chief Priestess of the Flame , Mother of Life , Giver of Death , and a few other high-sounding things . We have called her here to Base for questioning , and while she has been here some time , we have so far learned next to nothing from her . She is very intelligent , very alluring , very feminine -- but reveals nothing she does not wish to reveal . " Our purpose in having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information we could from her , and if possible , prevail upon her to cease her activities ; second , to deprive her cult of her leadership while you conducted your investigation . " Your orders , then , are simple : you will proceed at once to Lakos , and inquire into the activities of this order . Somehow , it must be crushed ; the means I shall leave to you . You will have complete cooperation of those in charge of operations on Lakos ; they are Zenians and natives of Earth , and you may depend upon them implicitly . Do not , however , place any faith in any Lakonians ; the entire native populace may well be suspected of participation in the rites of this cult , and they are a treacherous and ruthless people at best . Have you any questions , Commander ? " " None , " I had told him . " I have full authority to take any action I see fit ? " " Yes , at your discretion . Of course , " he had added rather hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temite . Only Lakonians can gather it in commercial quantities , under the existing conditions on Lakos , and our reserve supply is not large . We naturally wish to increase production there , rather than endanger it . It 's a delicate mission , but I 'm trusting you and your men to handle it for us . I know you will . " He had arisen then , smilingly , and offered his hand to me in that gesture which marks a son of Earth throughout the universe , thus bringing the interview to a close . * * * * * IN talking the things over with my officers , we had decided the mission promised to be an interesting one , but full of difficulties . The Ertak had set down on Lakos more than once , and we all had unpleasant memories of the place . The sunlight on Lakos , such as it was , was pale green and thin , lacking in warmth and vitality . The vegetation was flaccid and nearly colorless , more like a mushroom growth than anything else ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakonians , it was all the more surprising that a gracious creature like Liane could have sprung from their midst . They were a beetle-browed , dark race , with gnarled muscles and huge , knotted joints , speaking a guttural language all their own . Few spoke the universal language . But Liane , Chief Priestess of the Flame ! The image of her kept drifting back to my mind . There was a woman to turn any man 's head ! And such a turning would be dangerous , for Liane had no soft woman 's soul , if I had read her brilliant blue eyes aright . " Rather a beauty , is n't she , sir ? " commented Hendricks as I paused in my restless pacing , and glanced at the two-dimensional charts . " The stowaway ? Rather , " I agreed shortly . " And chief instigator of the trouble we 've been sent to eliminate . " " That seems almost -- almost unbelievable , does n't it ? " " Why , Mr. Hendricks ? " Correy and Kincaide entered before my junior officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excuse for not presenting his reasons . " Well , sir , she 's under guard , " reported Correy . " And now what 's to be done about her ? " " That , " I admitted , " is a question . After all , she 's an important personage at home . She was brought to Base as a guest , probably something of a guest of honor , of the Council , I gather . And , considering the work that 's cut out for us , it would seem like a poor move to antagonize her unduly . What do you gentlemen think ? " " I think you 're right , sir , " said Hendricks quickly . " I believe she should be given every consideration . " * * * * * Kincaide , my level-headed second officer , glanced curiously at Hendricks . " I see she 's made one friend , anyway , " he said . " Do n't let yourself slip , my boy ; I 've run across her kind before . They 're dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Kincaide , " replied Hendricks stiffly , an angry flush mounting to his checks . " I merely expressed a requested opinion . " " We 'll let that phase of it drop , gentlemen , " I cut in sharply , as I saw Kincaide 's eyes flash . Trust a woman to stir up strife and ill-feeling ! " What shall we do with her ? " " I believe , sir , " said Correy , " that we 'd be nice to her . Treat her as an honored guest ; make the best of a bad situation . If she 's what the Chief thought she is , the boss of this outfit we 've got to lick , then there 's no need of stroking her the wrong way , as I see it . " " And you , Mr. Kincaid ? " " I see no other way out of it . Under the circumstances , we ca n't treat her like a common culprit ; both her position and her sex would prevent . " " Very well , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable quarters for her --  " " I 'll give her mine , " put in Hendricks . " Correy will let me double up with him , I imagine . " " Sure , " nodded Correy . Kincaide glanced sharply at Hendricks , but said nothing . I knew , however , that he was thinking just what I was : that my young third officer was in for a bad , bad time of it . Just how bad , I think neither of us guessed . * * * * * Liane became a member of the officers ' mess on the Ertak . She occupied Hendricks ' stateroom , and , I must confess , with uncommon good judgment for a woman , remained there most of the time . She knew the reason for our mission , but this was one subject we never discussed . Nor did we mention the sect of which , according to the Chief of Command , she was the head . We did talk freely , when brought together at the table , on every other general topic . Liane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her remarks were always to the point . And she was a very good listener ; she paid flattering attention to the most casual remark . It seemed to me she was particularly gracious to Hendricks . Her strangely arresting blue eyes seldom left his face when he was speaking , and the greater portion of her remarks seemed addressed to him . Naturally , Hendricks responded as a flower responds to the warming rays of the sun . " We 'll do well , sir , to keep a weather eye on the youngster , " opined Correy one morning . ( I think I have previously explained that even in the unchanging darkness of space , we divided time arbitrarily into days and nights ) . " Unless I 'm badly mistaken , Hendricks is falling victim to a pair of blue eyes . " " He 's young , " I shrugged . " We 'll be there in two more days , and then we 'll be rid of her . " " Yes , " nodded Correy , " we 'll be there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , I hope . But -- suppose it should be serious , sir ? " " What do you mean ? " I asked sharply . I had been thinking , rather vaguely , along much the same lines , but to hear it put into words came as rather a shock . " I hope I 'm wrong , " said Correy very gravely . " But this Liane is an unusual woman . When I was his age , I could have slipped rather badly myself . Her eyes -- that slow smile -- they do things to a man . " At the same time , Liane is supposed to be the head of the thing we 're to stamp out ; you might say the enemy 's leader . And it would n't be a good thing , sir , to have a -- a friend of the enemy on board the Ertak , would it ? " A rebuke rose to my lips , but I checked it . After all , Correy had no more than put into words some fears which had been harassing me. * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to understand just what that thought meant to those of us who wore the Blue and Silver in those days . But a traitor was something we had never had . It was almost unbelievable that such a thing would ever happen ; that it could ever happen . And yet older men than Hendricks had thrown honor aside at the insistence of women less fascinating than Liane . I had felt the lure of her personality ; there was not one of us on board the Ertak who had not . And she had not exercised her wiles on any of us save Hendricks ; with the shrewdness which had made her the leader she was , she had elected to fascinate the youngest , the weakest , the most impressionable . " I 'll have a talk with him , Mr. Correy , " I said quietly . " Probably it is n't necessary ; I trust him implicitly , as I am sure you do , and the rest of us . " " Certainly , sir , " Correy replied hastily , evidently relieved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only , he 's very young , sir , and Liane is a very fascinating creature . " I kept my promise to Correy the next time Hendricks was on watch . " We 'll be setting down in a couple of days , " I commented casually . " It 'll be good to stretch our legs again , wo n't it ? " " It certainly will , sir . " " And I imagine that 's the last we 'll see of our fair stowaway , " I said , watching him closely . Hendricks ' face flushed and then drained white . With the tip of his forefinger he traced meaningless geometrical patterns on the surface of the instrument table . " I imagine so , sir , " he replied in a choked voice . And then , suddenly , in a voice which shook with released emotion . " Oh , I know what you 're thinking ! " he added . " What you 've all been thinking ; you , sir , and Correy and Kincaide . Probably the men , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I want you to believe that , sir . I may be impressionable , and certainly she is beautiful and -- and terribly fascinating ; but I 'm not quite a fool . I realize she 's on the other side ; that I ca n't , that I must not , permit myself to care . You -- you do believe that , sir ? " " Of course , lad ! " I put my hand reassuringly on his shoulder ; his whole body was shaking . " Forget it ; forget her as soon as you can . None of us have doubted you for an instant ; we just -- wondered . " " I could see that ; I could feel it . And it hurt , " said my junior officer with shame-faced hesitancy . " But I 'll forget her -- after she 's gone . " I let it go at that . After all , it was a rather painful subject for us both . The next day it did seem that he treated her with less attention ; and she noticed it , for I saw the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her glance traveled meditatively from Hendricks ' flushed face to my own . * * * * * The next morning , after the first meal of the day , she walked down the passage with me , one slim white hand placed gently within the curve of my arm . " Mr. Hendricks , " she commented softly , " seems rather distraught the last day or so . " " Yes ? " I said , smiling to myself , and wondering what was coming next . " Yes , Commander Hanson . " There was just the faintest suggestion of steeliness in her voice now . " I fancy you 've been giving him good advice , and painting me in lurid colors . Do you really think so badly of me ? " Her hand pressed my arm with warm friendliness ; her great blue eyes were watching me with beseeching interest . " I think , Liane , " I replied , " that Mr. Hendricks is a very young man . " " And that I am a dangerous woman ? " She laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , " your interests and ours are not identical . " " True , " she said coolly , pausing before the door of her stateroom . Her hand dropped from my arm , and she drew herself up regally . In the bright flow of the ethon tubes overhead she was almost irresistibly beautiful . " Our interests are not identical , Commander Hanson . They are widely divergent , directly opposed to each other , as a matter of fact . And -- may I be so bold as to offer you a bit of advice ? " I bowed , saying nothing . " Then , do n't attempt to meddle with things which are more powerful , than you and the forces you control . And -- do n't waste breath on Mr. Hendricks . Fair warning ! " Before I could ask for more complete explanation , she had slipped inside her stateroom and firmly closed the door . * * * * * We set down on Lakos late that afternoon , close to the city -- town , rather -- of Gio , where those in charge of operations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship in charge of Kincaide , I made my way quickly toward the headquarters building . We had gone but a few steps when Liane was surrounded by a shouting throng of her fellow Lakonians , and with a little mocking wave of a white hand , she stepped into a sort of litter which had been rushed to the scene , and was carried away . " For one , " commented Correy with a sigh of relief , " I 'm glad she 's out of sight . If I never see her again , it 'll be too soon . When do we start something ? " " Not until we 've talked with Fetter , who 's in command here . I have a letter for him from the Chief . We 'll see what he has to say . " One thing was certain ; we could look for no assistance of any kind from the natives . They regarded us with bleak scowls , from beneath shaggy , lowering brows , our uniforms of blue , with the silver ornaments of our service and rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were sinister figures indeed , clothed all alike in short , sleeveless tunics , belted loosely at the waist , feet and legs encased in leather buskins reaching nearly to the knees , their brown , gnarled limbs and stoop-shouldered postures giving them a half-bestial resemblance which was disturbing . Their walk was a sort of slow shuffle , which made their long arms dangle , swinging disjointedly . We entered the administration building of gray , dull stone , and were ushered immediately into the office of the head of operations . " Hanson ? " he greeted me . " Mighty glad to see you . You too , Correy . Terrible hole , this ; hope you 're not here for long . Sorry I could n't meet you at the ship ; got your radio , but could n't make it . Everything 's in a jam . Getting worse all the time . And we 're shorthanded ; not half enough men here . Sit down , sit down . Seem good to feel firm ground under your feet ? " " Not particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ertak 's . " Correy and I seated ourselves across the desk from the garrulous Fetter . " I 've a letter here from the Chief ; I believe it explains why we 're here . " " I can guess , I can guess . And none too soon . Things are in terrible shape . Terrible . " Fetter ripped open the letter and glanced through it with harried eyes . " Right , " he nodded . " I 'm to help you all I can . Place myself at your disposal . What can I do ? " " Tell us what 's up , " I suggested . " That would be a long story . I suppose you know something about the situation already . Several reports have gone in to Base . What did the Chief tell you , Hanson ? " * * * * * Briefly , I sketched the Chief 's report , Fetter nodding every few words . When I had finished , he rubbed his long , thin fingers together nervously , and stared down , frowning at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he went , " he said . " But he did n't go far enough . Wanted you to find out for yourself , I suppose . " Well , there is a secret society working against us here . Sect , I 'd call it . Undermined the whole inhabited portion of Lakos -- which is n't a great area , as you know . " " The Chief Priestess is Liane . I believe you said she stowed away on the Ertak with you ? " I nodded . " You 're keeping her under guard ? " asked Fetter . " No ; under the circumstances , we could n't . We had no authority , you see . A crowd of natives bore her away in triumph . " " Then your work 's cut out for you , " groaned Fetter . " She 's a devil incarnate . Beautiful , irresistible , and evil as corruption itself . If she 's back , I 'm afraid there 's nothing to be done . We 've been sitting on a volcano ever since she left . Pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what 's needed to set it off . " " We 'll have to take our chances , " I commented . " And now ; just what is the set-up ? " " The Worshipers of the Flame , they call themselves . The membership takes in about every male being on Lakos . They meet in the great caverns which honeycomb the continent . Ghastly places ; I 've seen some of the smaller ones . Continent was thrust up from the sea in a molten state , some scientific chap told me once ; these caverns were made by great belches of escaping steam or gas . You 'll see them . " She -- Liane -- and her priests rule solely by terror . The Lakonians are naturally just horses " ( a draft animal of ancient Earth , now extinct ) , " content to work without thinking . Liane and her crew have made them think -- just enough to be dangerous . Just what she tells them to think , and no more . Disobedient ones are punished by death . Rather a terrible death , I gather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of temite . She wishes to bargain with the Council -- at her own terms . " " What 's her price ? " I asked . " What does she want , wealth ? " " No . Power ! " Fetter leaned forward across the desk , hammering it with both fists to emphasize the word , his eyes gleaming from their deep sockets . " Power , Hanson , that 's what she craves . She 's insane on the subject . Utterly mad . She lusts after it . You asked her price ; it 's this : a seat in the Council ! " * * * * * I gasped audibly . A seat in the Council ! The Council , composed of the wisest heads of the universe , and ruling the universe with absolute authority ! " She is mad , " I said . " Crazy , " grunted Correy . " Plain crazy . A woman -- in the Council ! " Fetter nodded solemnly . " Mad -- crazy -- use your own terms , " he said . " But that 's her price . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , perhaps he did n't know . I learned it in a very roundabout way . She 'll make the formal demand when the time is ripe , never fear . And what 's more , unless these Worshipers of the Flame are stamped out -- she 'll get what she demands ! " " Impossible ! " " Not at all . You know what this place is . Only a Lakonian can stand this atmosphere long . No vitality to the light that does come through this damned green stuff they breathe for air ; and after a few days , the acid , metallic tang of it drives you frantic . Never can get used to it . " So the Lakonians have to mine the temite . And the universe must have temite , in quantities that ca n't be supplied from any other source . If the Lakonians wo n't mine it -- and they wo n't , when Liane tells them to quit -- what will the Council and your Service do about it ? " " Plenty , " growled Correy . " Nothing , " contradicted Fetter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprison him , punish him , as you will , but you ca n't make him work . " And there that phase of the matter rested . I asked him a number of questions which I felt would help us to start our work properly , and he answered every one of them promptly and fully . Evidently , Fetter had given his problem a great deal of thought , and had done more than a little intelligent investigating of his own . " If there 's anything else I can do to help you , " he said as he accompanied us to the door , " do n't fail to call upon me . And remember what I said : trust no one except yourselves . Study each move before you make it . These Lakonians are dull-witted , but they 'll do whatever Liane tells them . And she thinks fast and cunningly ! " * * * * * We thanked him for his warning , and hurried back to the ship through the sickly-green Lakonian dusk . The acrid odor of the atmosphere was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chap , Fetter , " commented Correy . " All wrought up , is n't he ? Worried stiff . " " I imagine he has cause to be . And -- he might have been right in saying we should have held Liane : perhaps we could have treated with her in some way . " " No chance ! Not that lady . When we treat with her , we 'll have to have the whip hand , utterly and completely . " The heavy outer door of the Ertak 's exit was open , but the transparent inner door , provided for just such an emergency , was in place , forming , in conjunction with a second door , an efficient air-lock . The guard saw us coming and , as we came up , had the inner door smartly opened , standing at salute as we entered . We returned his salute and went up to the navigating room , where I proposed to hold a brief council of war , informing Kincaide and Hendricks of what we had learned from Fetter , and deciding upon a course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had left on watch , was there waiting . " Well , sir , how do things stack up ? " he asked anxiously . " Not so good . Please ask Mr. Hendricks to report here at once , and I 'll give you the whole story . " Kincaide pressed the attention signal to Hendricks ' room , and waited impatiently for a response . There was none . " Try my room , " suggested Correy . " Maybe he has n't moved back to his own quarters yet . " " That 's what he said he would be doing , " replied Kincaide . But that signal too failed to bring any response . * * * * * Correy glanced at me , a queer , hurt expression in his eyes . " Shall I go forward and see if he -- if he 's ill ? " he asked quickly . " Please do , " I said , and as soon as he was gone I turned to the microphone and called the sentry on duty at the exit . " Commander Hanson speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . Some time ago . The lady came back , saying she had word from you ; she and Mr. Hendricks left a few minutes later . That was all right , sir ? " " Yes , " I said , barely able to force the word from between my lips . Hendricks ... and Liane ? Hendricks ... a traitor ? I cut the microphone and glanced at Kincaide . He must have read the facts in my eyes . " He 's ... gone , sir ? " " With Liane , " I nodded . The door burst open , and Correy came racing into the room . " He 's not there , sir ! " he snapped . " But in his room I found this ! " He held out an envelope , addressed to me . I ripped it open , glanced through the hasty , nervous scrawl , and then read it aloud : " Sir : I am leaving with Liane . I am sorry . It had to be . Hendricks . " " That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , " will make the blackest entry ever spread upon the log of the Ertak -- upon any ship of the Service . Let us dismiss this thing from our minds , and proceed . " But that was easier , by far , to propose than to accomplish . * * * * * It was late indeed when we finished our deliberations , but the plan decided upon was exceedingly simple . We would simply enforce our authority until we located definite resistance ; we would then concentrate our efforts upon isolating the source of this resistance and overcoming it . That we would find Liane at the bottom of our difficulties , we knew perfectly well , but we desired to place her in a definite position as an enemy . So far , we had nothing against her , no proof of her activities , save the rather guarded report of the Chief , and the evidence given us by Fetter . There were three major continents on Lakos , but only one of them was inhabited or habitable , the other two being within the large northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flame were centered about the chief city of Gio , Fetter had told us , and therefore we were in position to start action without delay . Force of men would avail us nothing , since the entire crew of the Ertak would be but a pitiful force compared to the horde Liane could muster . Our mission could be accomplished -- if , indeed , it could be accomplished at all -- by the force of whatever authority our position commanded , and the outwitting of Liane . Accordingly , it was decided that , in the emergency , all three of us would undertake the task , leaving the ship in charge of Sub-officer Scholey , chief of the operating room crew , and a very capable , level-headed man . I gave him his final instructions as we left the ship , early the next morning : " Scholey , we are leaving you in a position of unusual responsibility . An emergency makes it necessary , or at least desirable , for Mr. Correy , Mr. Kincaide and myself to leave the ship . Mr. Hendricks has already departed ; therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remain here for five days ; if we do not return in that time , leave for Base , and report the circumstances there . The log will reveal full authority for your actions . " " Very well , sir ! " He saluted , and we passed through the air-lock which protected the Ertak from the unpleasant atmosphere of Lakos , armed only with atomic pistols , and carrying condensed rations and menores at our belts . * * * * * We went directly to the largest of the mines , the natives regarding us with furtive , unfriendly eyes . A great crowd of men were lounging around the mouth of the mine , and as we approached , they tightened their ranks , as though to block our passage . " We 'll bluff it through , " I whispered . " They know the uniform of the Service , and they have no leader . " " I 'd like to take a swing at one of them , " growled Correy . " I do n't like their looks -- not a bit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked . We marched up to the packed mass as though we had not even noticed them , and slowly and unwillingly , they opened a path for us , closing in behind us with rather uncomfortable celerity . For a moment I regretted we had not taken a landing crew from the Ertak . However , we won through the mouth of the mine without violence , but here a huge Lakonian who seemed to be in authority held up his hand and blocked our way . " Let me handle him , sir , " said Correy from the corner of his mouth . " I understand a little of their language . " " Right , " I nodded . " Make it strong ! " Correy stepped forward , his head thrust out truculently , thumbs hooked through his belt , his right hand suggestively near his automatic pistol . He rapped out something in unpleasant gutturals , and the tall Lakonian replied volubly . " He says it 's orders , " commented Correy over his shoulder . " Now I 'll tell him who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lakonian , and spoke with emphatic briefness . The Lakonian fell back a step , hesitated , and started to reply . Correy stopped him with a single word , and motioned us to follow him . The guard watched us doubtfully , and angrily , but he let us pass . " He told me , " explained Correy , " that she had given orders . Did n't name her , but we can guess , all right . I told him that if she wished to say anything to us , she could do it in person ; that we were n't afraid of her , of him , or all the Lakonians who ever breathed green soup and called it air . He 's a simple soul , and easily impressed . So we got by . " " Nice work , " I commended him . " It 's an auspicious start , anyway . " * * * * * The mouth of the mine was not the usual vertical shaft ; as Fetters had told us , it was a great ramp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by jets of greenish flame from metal brackets set into the wall at regular intervals , and fed by a never-failing interplay of natural gas . The passageway was of varying height and width , but nowhere less than three times my height from floor to ceiling , and it was broad enough at its narrowest so that ten men might have marched easily abreast . The floor , apparently , had been smoothed by human effort , but for the rest , the corridor was , to judge from the evidence , entirely natural for the walls of shiny black rock bore no marks of tools . At intervals , other passages branched off from the main one we were following , at greater and less angles , but these were much narrower , and had very apparently been hewn in the solid rock . Like the central passage , they were utterly deserted . " We 'll be coming out on the other side , pretty soon , " commented Correy after a steady descent of perhaps twenty minutes . " This tunnel must go all the way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From behind us came a soft , whispering sound , the nature of which we could not determine . " Sounds like the shuffle of many feet , far behind , " suggested Kincaide gravely . " Or , more likely , the air rushing around the corners of those smaller passages , " I suggested . " This is a drafty hole . Or it may be just the combined flarings of all these jets of flame . " " Maybe you 're right , sir , " nodded Correy . " Anyway , we wo n't worry about it until we have to . I guess we just keep on going ? " " That seems to be about all there is to do ; we should enter one of the big subterranean chambers Fetters mentioned , before long . " * * * * * As a matter of fact , it was but a minute or two later , that we turned a curve in the corridor and found ourselves looking into a vast open space , the roof supported by huge pillars of black stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools thrown down by workmen . " This is where they take out the temite ore , I imagine , " said Kincaide , picking up a loose fragment of rock . He pointed to a smudge of soft , crumbly gray metal , greasy in appearance , showing on the surface of the specimen he had picked up . " That 's the stuff , sir , that 's causing us all this trouble : nearly pure metallic temite . " He dropped the fragment , looking about curiously . " But where , " he added , " are the miners ? " " I 'm inclined to believe we 'll find out before we get back to the Ertak , " said Correy grimly . " Everything 's moved along too sweetly ; trouble 's just piling up somewhere . " " That remains to be seen , " I commented . " Let 's move on , and see what 's beyond . That looks like a door of some sort , on the far side . Perhaps it will lead us to something more interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This underground business is getting on my nerves ! " It was a door I had seen , a huge slab of light yellow-green metal . I paused , my hand on the simple latch . " Stand to one side , " I said softly . " Let 's see what happens . " I lifted the latch , and the heavy door opened inward . Cautiously , I stared through the portal . Inside was blackness and silence ; somewhere , in the far distance , I could see two or three tiny pin-pricks of green light . " We 'll take a look around , anyway , " I said . " Follow me carefully and be ready for action . It seems all right , but somehow , I do n't like the looks of things . " In single file , we passed beyond the massive door , the light from the large room outside streaming ahead of us , our shadows long and grotesque , moving on the rocky floor ahead of us . Then , suddenly , I became aware that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned swiftly ; the door must be closing ! As I turned , lights roared up all around us , intense light which struck at our eyes with almost tangible force . A great shout rose , echoing , to a vaulted ceiling . Before we could move or cry out , a score of men on either side had pinioned us . " Damnation ! " roared Correy . " If I only had the use of my fists -- just for a second ! " * * * * * We were in a great cavern , the largest I have ever beheld . A huge bubble , blown in the molten rock by powerful gases from the seething interior of the world . The roof was invisible above our heads , and the floor sloped down gently in every direction , toward a central dais , so far away that its details were lost to us . From the center of the dais a mighty pillar of green flame mounted into the air nearly twenty times the height of a man . All around the dais , seated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hundreds of them , thousands of them , and they were as silent and motionless as death . They paid no heed to us ; they crouched , each in his place , and stared at the column of greenish flame . " It was a trap , " muttered Kincaide as our captors marched us rapidly toward the dais in the center of the huge amphitheater . " They were waiting for us ; I imagine we have been watched all the time . And we walked into the trap exactly like a bunch of schoolboys . " " True -- but we 've found , I believe , what we wished to find , " I told him . " This is the meeting place of the Worshipers of the Flame . There , I imagine is the Flame itself . And unless I 'm badly mistaken , that 's Liane waiting up there in the center ! " It was Liane . She was seated on a massive , simple throne of the greenish-yellow metal , the column of fire rising directly behind her like an impossible plume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of the odd metal , were perhaps twenty old men , their heads crowned with great , unkempt manes of white hair . And standing beside Liane 's throne , at her right hand , was -- Hendricks ! * * * * * His shoulders drooped , his chin rested upon his breast . He was wearing , not the blue-and-silver uniform of the Service , but a simple tunic of pale green , with buskins of dark green leather , laced with black . He did not look up as we were ushered before this impressive group , but Liane watched us with smiling interest . Liane , seated there upon her throne , was not the Liane of those days in the Ertak . There , she had been scarcely more than a peculiarly fascinating young woman with a regal bearing and commanding eyes . Here , she was a goddess , terrifyingly beautiful , smiling with her lips , yet holding the power of death in the white hands which hung gracefully from the massive arms of the throne . She wore a simple garment of thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , caught at one shoulder with a flashing green stone . The other shoulder was bared , and the black garment was a perfect foil for the whiteness of her perfect skin , her amazing blue eyes , and the pale gold of her hair . She lifted one hand in a slight gesture as our conductors paused before the dais ; they fell away and formed a close cordon behind us . " We have awaited your coming , " she said in her sibilant voice . " And you are here . " " We are here , " I said sternly , " representing , through our Service , the Supreme Council of the universe . What word shall we take back to those who sent us ? " Liane smiled , a slow , cruel smile . The pink fingers of one hand tapped gently on the carven arm of her throne . The eyes of the semicircle of old men watched us with unwavering hatred . " The word you carry will be a good word , " she said slowly . " Liane has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have full understanding of Liane 's power . For while the word Liane shall give you to bear back is a good word , still , Liane is but a woman , and women have been known to change their minds . Is that not so , Commander Hanson ? " " That is so , Liane , " I nodded . " And we are glad to hear that your wisdom has led you to be gracious . " She leaned forward suddenly , her eyes flashing with anger . " Mark you , it is not wisdom but a whim of mine which causes me to be graciously minded ! " she cried . " Think you that Liane is afraid ? Look about you ! " * * * * * We turned slowly and cast our eyes about that great gathering . As far as the eye could reach , in every direction , was a sea of faces . And as we looked , the door through which we had entered this great hall was flung open , and a crowd of tiny specks came surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's command , " she laughed . " They are those who played , to disarm your suspicions , at blocking your entry to this place . They did but follow you , a safe distance behind . " " I thought so , " murmured Correy . " Things were going too smoothly . That was what we heard , sir . " I nodded , and looked up at Liane . " You have many followers , " I said . " Yet this is but a small world , and behind the Council are all the worlds of the universe . " Liane threw back her head and laughed , a soft , tinkling sound that rose clearly above the hollow roar of the mighty flame behind her throne . " You speak bravely , " she said , " knowing that Liane holds the upper hand . Did your Council take armed action against us , we would blow up these caverns which are the source of your precious temite , and bury it so deeply no force that could live here could extract it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of this exchange of sharp words . Liane has already said that she is disposed to be gracious . Does that not content you ? " " I will bear back to those who sent me whatever word you have to offer ; it is not for me to judge its graciousness , " I said coolly . " Then -- but first , let me show you how well I rule here , " she said . She spoke to one of the old men seated at her feet ; he arose and disappeared in a passage leading from directly beneath the dais . " You will see , presently , the punishment of Liane , " she said smilingly . " Liane , Chief Priestess of the Flame , Mother of Life , Giver of Death , Most Worshiped of the Worshipers . " Perhaps you wonder how it came that Liane sits here in judgment upon a whole people ? Let me tell you , while we await the execution of Liane 's judgment . " The father of Liane , and his father before him , back unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Chief Priests of the Worshipers of the Flame . But they were lacking in ambition , in knowledge , and in power . Their followers were but few , and their hands were held out in benediction and not in command . " But the father of Liane had no son ; instead he had a daughter , in whom was all the wisdom of those who had been the Chief Priests . She gathered about her a group of old men , shrewd and cunning , the lesser priests and those who would know the feel of power , who were not priests . You see them here at the feet of Liane . " And under Liane 's guidance , the ranks of the Worshipers grew , and as this power grew , so grew the power of Liane , until the time came when no man , no woman , on the face of Lakos , dared question the command of the Chief Priestess . And those who would have rebelled , were made to feel the power of Liane -- as these you see here now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind him were two miserable wretches , closely guarded by a dozen armed men . Liane spoke briefly to the old man , and then turned to us . " The first of these is one who has dared to disobey , " she explained . " He brought out more of the ore than Liane had ordered . Do you hear the multitude ? They know already what his fate will be . " A long , shuddering whisper had arisen from the thousands of beings crouched there in the amphitheater , as the uncouth figure of the prisoner was led up a flight of steep , narrow steps to the very base of the flame . Hendricks , still hiding his face from us , bent over Liane and whispered something in her ear ; she caressed his arm softly , and shook her head . Hendricks leaned more heavily against the throne , shuddering . Slowly , the flame was dying , until we could see that it was not a solid pillar of fire , but a hollow circle of flame , fed by innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle more than the length of a man across . Into those deadly circles the condemned man was led . His legs were bound swiftly , so that he could not move , and the old man stepped back quickly . As though his movement had been a signal , the flames shot up with a roar , until they lost themselves far over our heads . As one man , the three of us started forward , but the guards hemmed us in instantly . " Fools ! " cried Liane . " Be still ! The power of Liane is absolute here . " We stared , fascinated , at the terrible sight . The flame spouted , streaks of blue and yellow streaking up from its base . Mercifully , we could not see within that encircling wall of fire . * * * * * Slowly , the flame died down again . A trap-door opened in the circle , and some formless thing dropped out of sight . Liane questioned the old man again , her eyes resting upon the other prisoner . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liane , " she explained smilingly . " He said Liane was cruel ; that she was selfish . He also must feel the embrace of the sacred Flame . " I heard , rather than saw , the ghastly drama repeated , for I had bent my head , and would not look up . Liane was no woman ; she was a fiend . And yet for her a trusted officer , a friend , had forsworn his service and his comrades . I wondered , as I stood there with bowed head , what were the thoughts which must have been passing through Hendricks ' mind . " You fear to look upon the punishment of Liane ? " the voice of the unholy priestess broke in upon my shuddering reverie . " Then you understand why her power is absolute ; why she is Mother of Life , and Giver of Death , throughout all Lakos . And now for the word I promised you , a gracious word from one who could be terrible and not gracious , were that her whim . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , to make for herself a place in this Supreme Council of which you speak with so much awe and reverence , Commander Hanson . But , by happenchance , another whim has seized her . " * * * * * Liane looked up at Hendricks , smilingly , and took one of his hands in hers . It was wonderful how her face softened as he returned , fiercely , the pressure of her soft hands . " I know it will sound strange to your ears , " she said in a voice almost tender , " but Liane is , after all , a woman , with many , if not all , a woman 's many weaknesses . And while even in his presence Liane will say that her lover was at the beginning looked upon as no more than a tool which might further Liane 's power , he has won now a place in her heart . " I saw Hendricks tremble as she admitted her love , and that portion of his face which we could see flushed hotly . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for the present , the place in the Council which she could command . For after all , that would be a remote power , lacking in the elements of physical power which Liane has over these , her people , and in which she has learned to delight . " So , Commander Hanson , bear to your superiors this word : Liane will permit a production of whatever reasonable amount of temite is desired . She will remain here with her consort , brooking no interference , no changes , no commands from any person or organization . Go , now , and take with you the words of Liane ! " I looked up at her gravely , and shook my head . " We shall go , " I said , " and we shall take with us your words . But I warn you that the words you have spoken are treason to the universe , in that you have defied the Council ! " Liane leaped from her throne , her scarlet lips drawn back against her white and gleaming teeth . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hotly as the flame which rose behind her . " Go ! And quickly ! " she fairly screamed . " If you have no desire to feel the embrace of the sacred Flame , then go ! " I bowed silently , and motioned to Correy and Kincaide . Swiftly , we made our way down a long aisle , surrounded by motionless figures staring unwinkingly at the column of fire , toward the door by which we had entered this great chamber . Behind us , I could hear Liane 's clear voice lifted in her own guttural language , as she addressed the multitude . * * * * * Safely within the Ertak , we discussed the morning 's adventure over a late luncheon . " I suppose , " said Kincaide , " there 's nothing left to do but tell Fetter as much as seems wise , to reassure him , and then return to Base to make our report . " " We 'll come back , if we do , " growled Correy . " And we 'll come back to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Undoubtedly that 's true , " I admitted . " Still , I believe we should put it up to Base , and through Base to the Council , before doing anything more . Much , if not all , of what she said was perfectly true . " " It was that , " nodded Kincaide . " There were scores , if not hundreds of doors leading into that big chamber ; I imagine it can be reached , underground , from any point on the continent . And those winding passages would be simple to defend from any form of invasion . " " But could these Lakonians fight ? " asked Correy . " That 's what I 'd like to know . I doubt it . They look like a sleepy , ignorant lot . " " I think they 'd fight , to the death , if Liane ordered them to , " I replied thoughtfully . " Did you notice the way they stared at the flame , never moving , never even winking ? My idea is that it exercises a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the right opportunity to impress her will upon them . " " I wondered about that , " Kincaide commented . " I believe you 're right , sir . Any idea as to when we 'll shove off ? " " There 's no particular hurry ; Fetter will be busy until evening , I imagine , so we wo n't bother him until then . As soon as we 've had a chat with him , we can start . " " And without Hendricks , " said Kincaide , shaking his head sadly . " I wonder --  " " If you do n't mind , Mr. Kincaide , we wo n't mention his name on the Ertak after this , " I interrupted . " I , for one , would rather forget him . Would n't you ? " " I would , sir , if I could , " said Kincaide softly . " But that 's not easy , is it ? " It was n't easy . As a matter of fact , it was impossible . I knew I would never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beside the woman for whom he had disgraced his uniform , hiding his head in shame from the eyes of the men he had called comrades , and who had called him friend . But to talk of him was morbid . * * * * * It was late in the afternoon when I called Correy and Kincaide to the navigating room , where I had spent several hours charting our return course . " I believe , gentlemen , " I remarked , " that we can call on Mr. Fetter now . I 'll ask you to remain in charge of the ship , Mr. Kincaide , while Mr. Correy and I --  " An attention signal sounded sharply to interrupt me . I answered it instantly . " Sentry at exit , sir , " said an excited voice . " Mr. Hendricks and the woman stowaway are here asking for you . They say it is very urgent . " " Bring them both here at once , under guard , " I ordered . " Be sure you are properly relieved . " " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were watching me with curious eyes . My excitement must have shown upon my face . " Mr. Hendricks and Liane are at the exit , asking to see me , " I snapped . " They 'll be here in a moment . What do you suppose is in the air ? " " Hendricks ? " muttered Correy , his face darkening . " It seems to me he has a lot of nerve to --  " There was a sharp tap on the door . " Come ! " I ordered quickly . The door opened and Liane , followed by Hendricks , hurried into the room . " That will do , " I nodded to the guard who had accompanied them . " You may go . " " You wonder why we 're here , I suppose ? " demanded Liane . " I 'll tell you , quickly , for every instant is precious . " This was a very different Liane . She was no longer clad in diaphanous black ; she was wearing a tunic similar to the one she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was torn and soiled . Her lips , as she talked , twitched with an insane anger ; her amazing eyes were like those of a cornered beast of the wilderness . " My council of wise old men turned against me when I told them my plans to marry the man of my choice . They said he was an outsider , an enemy , a foreigner . They would have none of him . They demanded that I give him to the Flame , and marry one of my own kind . They had not , of course , understood what I had said to you there in the great chapel of the Flame . " I defied them . We escaped through a passage which is not known to any save myself , and the existence of which my father taught me years ago . We are here , but they will guess where we have gone . My old men are exciting my people against me -- and for that shall all , down to the last one , know the embrace of the Flame ! " She gritted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage . " I -- I am safe . I can command them ; I can make them know my power , and I shall . The Flame will have much to feed upon in the days which are to come , I promise you . But my beloved would not be safe ; at this moment I can not protect him . So I have brought him back . I -- I know he ... but I will not be weak . I am Liane ! " * * * * * She faced Hendricks , who had stood there like a graven image , watching her . Her arms went about his neck ; her lips sought his . " My beloved ! " she whispered . " Liane was but a woman , after all . Darling ! Good-by ! " She kissed him again , and hurried to the door . " One more thing ! " she cried . " I must master them myself . I must show them I -- I , Liane -- am ruler here . You promise ? You promise me you will not interfere ; that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I could put my objections into words . " Promise ! " she commanded . " There are hundreds , thousands of them ! You can not slay them all -- and if you did , there would be more . I can bend them to my will ; they know my power . Promise , or there will be many deaths upon your hands ! " " I promise , " I said . " And you -- all of you ? " she demanded , sweeping Correy and Kincaide with her eyes . " Commander Hanson speaks for us all , " nodded Kincaide . With a last glance at Hendricks , whose eyes had never left her for an instant , she was gone . Hendricks uttered a long , quivering sigh . His face , as he turned to us , was ghastly white . " She 's gone , " he muttered . " Forever . " " That 's exceedingly unfortunate , sir , for you , " I replied crisply . " As soon as it 's perfectly safe , we 'll see to it that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not touch him . " You do n't understand , " he said dully . " I know what you think , and I do not blame you . She came back ; you know that . " ' You are coming with me , ' she said . ' I care for you . I want you . You are coming with me , at once . ' I told her I was not ; that I loved her , but that I could not , would not , go . " She opened a port and showed me one of her countrymen , standing not far away , watching the ship . He held something in his hand . " ' He has one of your hand bombs , ' she told me . ' I found it while I was hidden and took it with me when I left . If you do not come with me , he will throw it against the ship , destroy it , and those within it . ' " There was nothing else for me to do . She permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note I left . I pleaded with her ; did all I could . Finally I persuaded her to give you the word she did , there before the great flame . " She brought me back here at the risk of her own life , and , what is even more precious to her , her power . In -- in her own way , she loves me .... " * * * * * It was an amazing story ; a second or two passed before any of us could speak . And then words came , fast and joyous ; our friend , our trusted fellow-officer had come back to us ! I felt as though a great black cloud had slid from across the sun . And then , above our voices , rose a great mutter of sound . We glanced at one another , wonderingly . Hendricks was the first to make a move . " That 's the mob ! " he said , darting toward the door . We followed him swiftly to the exit of the ship , through the air-lock , out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking , very slowly and deliberately , her head flung back proudly , toward the city . Coming toward her , like a great ragged wave , was a mighty mass of humanity , led by capering old men -- undoubtedly the lesser priests , who had turned against her . " The portable projectors , sir ! " begged Correy excitedly . " A pair of them , and that mob --  " " We 're bound by our promise , " I reminded him . " She 's not afraid ; her power is terrible . I believe she 'll win without them . Look ! " Liane had paused . She lifted one hand in a gesture of command , and called out to the rabble . Correy translated the whole thing for me later . " Halt ! " she cried sharply . " Who moves upon the Chief Priestess of the Flame earns the embrace of the Flame ! " The crowd halted , cowering ; then the old man shouted to them and gestured them onward . With a rush , the front ranks came on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You would disobey Liane ? Yet even yet it is not too late ; Liane gives you one chance more . You little know the Chief Priestess of the Flame if you think she will tolerate an encroachment of her power . Back ! Back , I say , or you all shall feel the might of Liane ! " Before her tirade the mob faltered , but again the crazed old men led them on . Liane turned , saw us , and made a regal gesture of farewell . From the bosom of her tunic she snatched a small black object , and swung it high above her head . " The bomb ! " shouted Hendricks . " She has it ; she --  " At the very feet of the onrushing crowd the black object struck . There was a hollow roar ; a blast of thundering air swept us backward to the ground . When we scrambled to our feet , Liane was gone . The relentless mob had gone . Where they had been was a great crater of raw earth , strewn with ghastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures ran frantically away from that scene of death . " Gone ! " I said . " Power was a mania , an obsession with her . Even her death was a supreme gesture -- of power , of authority . " " Liane , " Hendricks whispered . " Chief Priestess of the Flame ... Giver of Death .... " * * * * * With Liane gone , and with her the old men who had tried to snatch her power from her hand , and who might have caused us trouble , the rebellion of the Lakonians was at an end . Leaderless , they were helpless , and I believe they were happy in the change . Sometimes the old ways are better than the new , and Liane 's regime had been merciless and rather terrible . There are many kinds of women : great women , and women with small souls ; women filled with the spirit of sacrifice ; selfish women , good women and bad . And Liane ? I leave her for you to judge . She was a woman ; classify her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and perhaps I have forgotten the ways of women . I do not wish to judge , on one hand to be called bitter and hard , on the other hand to be condemned as soft with advancing age . I have given you the story of Liane , Chief Priestess of the Flame . How , you clever and infallible members of this present generation , do you judge her ? * * * * *
