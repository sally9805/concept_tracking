Recreation time for the men prisoners of New York County Penitentiary came one cheerful morning last week . A guard at the end of the long recreation room , through whose windows the sun laid a pattern of bright stripes , watched the frowzy prisoners shuffle from their cells to walk , talk , or to shoot dice for cigarets &; candy . <P> The guard suddenly became aware of one Joe Fatigate , 25 , habitual brawler , at the far end of the hall . From Joe Fatigate 's forehead projected the bone handle of a penitentiary table knife . The 4-in. blade of the knife was neatly buried within the man 's brain . <P> While two prison doctors tried to pull the blade from the brain , the prisoner , who had not lost consciousness , smoked a cigaret , chatted quietly . The handle broke off from the blade . The prisoner proceeded to a hospital , with a Catholic chaplain administering final rites . A surgeon with a pair of strong pliers pulled out the blade , leaving Joe Fatigate apparently none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice at Bowdoin College in the spring of 1932 , Freshman Tapping Selah Reeve had the back of his head pierced by a javelin . He pulled the spiked rod from his skull , ran a quarter mile to the college infirmary .
