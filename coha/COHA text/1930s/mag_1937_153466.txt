" Defendants do not believe the Judge should have manifested in his charge the detestation of this particular type of crime . He should have denounced piracy in the South Seas but not election thievery in Missouri . He should have exhibited indifference . He should have been lukewarm in his charge . He should have softpedaled the matter . He should have said : " ' Gentlemen of the grand jury : everybody 's doing it ; let it pass . ' " So said Federal Judge Merrill E. Otis last week in Kansas City . He also overruled demurrers to a set of indictments and prepared the way for the beginning this week of a trial that has already shaken the concrete foundations of Kansas City politics . <P> Dripping Fingers , One day last autumn some 20 Kansas City lawyers paid a call on Federal Judge Albert L. Reeves . They asked for a Federal investigation of Kansas City elections . Judge Reeves , tall , bony , with sagging cheeks , stone grey hair and 14 years on the Federal bench , told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , promised to investigate fully after election . <P> The election was a great triumph for Kansas City 's Democratic machine . Its endorsees swept all offices : Lloyd Crow Stark was elected Governor , 12 Democrats were elected to Missouri 's 13 seats in the House of Representatives . Kansas City with only 10% of Missouri 's population gave Roosevelt 30% of his majority in the State . <P> Boss Tom Pendergast , having been ill for more than five months , announced that he was turning over control of his organization to his nephew James who had done so well during the campaign as boss pro tern ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . A banquet was given for Fred Bellemere , chairman of Kansas City 's election board and he was mentioned as a sure-fire future prospect for Governor . Then suddenly in mid-December Judge Reeves impaneled a grand jury of 20 men . Instead of saying , " Everybody is doing it , let it pass , " he said to them : <P> " I ca n't sit quietly in my district here . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ... to witness a man going with dripping fingers to the ballot box . The registration and voting of people who are not naturalized citizens is a crime . ... I am informed the names of such persons will be presented to you . ... If a man casts a dishonest ballot he cocks and fires a gun at the heart of America . Whether a bribe is given or taken in a Congressional election , it is a violation of the laws of the U. S. I am informed violations of this nature took place . <P> " We ca n't surrender the ballot boxes to thugs , gangsters and plug-uglies who patrol the streets with machine guns . We ca n't stand for that any longer . Reach for all-even if you find them in high authority . Move on them . My information is that the population of Kansas City is less than 400,000 . The last registration was something like 270,000 . ... A registration like that would call for a population something like 600,000. "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
