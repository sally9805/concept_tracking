F OR every motion picture produced in a Hollywood studio , a down more are manufactured on the film empire 's busiest street corners . Conversational producers with unhappy eyes and week-old beards talk convincingly of celluloid epics that can be written , cast and shot in much less time than it takes them to wheedle a five-spot from your already complaining jeans . They know the picture business , know everyone in it , and have compliments for nobody . Their lament . runs as follows : " What did he ever write , the rat ? , . .

You 've passed these street corners for twenty years and the faces you see are constantly changing . That 's what worries you . Being braver than most people , I always laughingly admit that I 've picked my corner for the future , but the truth of the matter is , I 'm like a small boy whistling as he walks by a cemetery . Yesterday , I was thrown into a sort of burnt-umber gloom by something I saw on a motion-picture set . The director was running some three hundred people through their paces and , ordinarily , I would have been thrilled with the fire and color of it all . The setting was a replica of an ancient English harbor town . The masts of square-riggers pierced the sky . Swashbuckling sailors swaggered about . Pulchritudinous bits of femininity swished to and fro in long , flowing satin garments , and all about were barking dogs , laughing children and the rumble of vehicular traffic . Stars In Eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed it to the scene he had just made with the principals . If something was wrong , would I mind telling him instead of doing a Rodin'e Thinker back of camera ? / lied to him ; I said I liked the scene . As a matter of fact , I was n't even watching it . My eyes were on two atmosphere characters in the background . One , a woman in a bright green dress , had once been a top star for this same company . Her duty now was to walk across the street : just walk across the street  --  that was all . A day 's work for which she got ten dollars . And perhaps she would n't work the next day , or the next . The other was a sailor . He stood in the entranceway of a grog shop , looking most unhappy in a period wig and an fitting blouse . Once upon a time he had been the William Powell of pictures . Later , I talked to both of them . If the woman was unhappy over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show it . Her summation of the situation was a simple " Well , that 's the way it goes . " The man had nothing to say . When I told hint I had once written several stories for him , he merely grunted . The assistant director told me he was getting over a Thanksgiving binge . The real story of Hollywood is rarely told by magazine writers . They deal mainly with the gloss and glamour that supposedly emanate from the place . To them , it is all gaiety and big salaries . There is no sorrow , Twelve hours at the studio and twelve hours at the night clubs . If there is stupidity , it belongs to the producer . The director is a genius . The actor is quite the most versatile person that ever T WO weeks ago we were shooting scenes on Santa Catalina Island . A man approached the director . He was wild-eyed , badly in need of a shave and shaking like the proverbial aspen . If he did n't get work doing something , he would commit suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted work  --  any kind of work . Surely , we must have need of a watchman on the set . Unfortunately , every position was filled , but the director promised him three weeks ' work on the return trip . Apparently it was just a promise to him . the sort of thing he had heard so of ten before . Two days later his body was found in the ocean . I suppose I should n't worry about such matters , but I do . True , they never worried about me in their heyday , hut , in fairness to them , neither did they have the job of balancing the laws of dramaturgy between a ream of paper and a gross of yellow pencils . My main weakness is in sensing drama where often it does n't even exist . My father says I have no right to classify these people as unfortunates ; that even they would resent the implication . It is his contention that they enjoyed a tasty slice of life , which is more than can be said for the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of living offers favorable comparison to a fellow trying to play the piano with a pair of first baseman 's mitts .

Somewhere in that building are a couple of punks with pimples on their chins who will take my job someday . And if you 'll ask a star in one of her rare honest moments what she thinks about the matter , she 'll tell you she 's constantly hoping against the sudden appearance of a gazelle-eyed chicken from Withers-Withers , Washington , or some other place , whose naturally endowed personality will make her suffer by comparison . However , my next-door neighbor assures me there is nothing to worry about . He is a statistician by trade and a moocher by avocation , to which my rapidly diminishing pile of dahlia bulbs will attest . Ho maintains that the stellar youngsters of today are not quite so foolish with their money as were those outstanding personalities a decade ago . And more , they are sanely conscious of the natural changing of conditions . " Today , " he said , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution , an industry unto himself . I 'll give you Clark Gable , for example . Right now he 's Number 1 male star in the motion-picture business , and because he is , one hundred thousand persons eat regularly every day . And , proportionately , the same thing can be said about Gary Cooper , Norma Shearer , Janet Gaynor , Claudette Colbert. , and even the diminutive Shirley Temple . " In the old days  --  the ones you 're talking about  --  pictures were made for marbles and chalk . You were a technical director and , all by your little self , you handled a dozen , or more , companies . Today , a complete unit of stylists in drafting concentrates on one production . And the lumber used in its sets is more than you probably used all season . " Putting a Dent In Unemployment " I do n't wish to be rude , " I said to him , but are n't we getting a hit off the subject ? " " A statistician always works around to his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his facts on the white stuccoed walls of my home with a soft lead pencil . And these were the facts : When a Gable picture starts , it is as important an industrial matter as when a new bridge is started or a new tract of land opened . It is employment in hand . It can best begin with the inconspicuous reader in the story department . He earns his wages by reading submitted material , and if he finds a story worthy of being a Gable vehicle , he gets a put on the back and , possibly , a raise . I wo n't argue the latter point . The author of that submitted story , who , up to now , has been promising his wife a new dress for the last seven years , goes nuts when he gets his cheek . So do the butcher , the baker and the candlestick maker in his immediate locale . The agent who arranged the sale also chuckles over his 10 per cent and thanks his lucky star for having shifted him to this lucrative business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity writers . These are men with a natural aptitude for transposing the printed story into the language of the screen . They are highly paid and a Gable picture means months of effort on their part . The moment their work is done , the ball starts rolling in earnest . A staff of research experts assimilate the facts in the picture and struggle to make it technically perfect . A tidy sum of money is at their disposal  --  with which to purchase books on the subject . And maybe you think that makes the publisher mad . Costumers oversee a flock of seamstresses , and sewing machines hum for weeks . The major part of their effort , however , is devoted to the ladies in the piers and not to Gable ; especially the leading woman . If Joan Crawford teams well with Gable , so much the better . Joan wears many clothes and lovely ones . Cost in these matters is never dismissed ; it 's a Gable picture and the lady must be lovely . The Economic Value of the Star Because Gable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters , painters , set dressers , drapery experts , furniture makers , electricians , and a myriad of odd-jobs men . And because he makes six pictures a year , there is very little layoff in between . According to the statistician , who by now has ruined my front well and moved to the uprights on my partecochere , the personable Mr. Gable affords one hundred and two thousand persons an average of one week 's work each . This includes principal actors in the cast , extra people and the aforementioned workers . It also takes in the camera crew , the laboratory men and other people whose work is unique and varied . For instance , there 's the fellow who accumulates quite a bank account by making artificial flowers . Another owns a collection of odd and foreign automobiles which he rents for as much as seventy-five dollars a day . The antique man and the gent who dabbles in wooden Indians and firearms of an ancient period . Nor must we overlook the owners of trained dogs , monkeys , elephants and even fleas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no extra room in which to keep the mortgages , either . Down at the harbor , men thrive on the activities of the studios . They rent anything from a rowboat to an ocean steamer . To show their faith in the business , they invest their profits in old-time sailing vessels  --  square-riggers and ships of that sort  --  and the bare mentioning of a proposed sea story will find them camped on your doorstep . Out in the valley , north of Hollywood , the sandy terrain is dotted with scores of barns and training corrals . High-school horses , gaited horses , flea-bitten cow ponies , sway-backed nags , burros and jackasses  --  all awaiting the jangle of the telephone , a possible call to a motion-picture studio . ( Continued en Page 52 ) Could you write yo ( Continued from Ange so/ And all because there 's a fellow like Gable , or his counterpart . Even collecting the gentle taxes levied by the Government is not altogether an unhappy job for the boys back in Washington . Nor does Uncle Sam stop there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamps . Mr. Gable sends out two hundred and forty thousand photographs a year . And to that you can add another two hundred and forty thousand stamps on letters requesting the photographs . " All of which , " concludes the statistician , " gives to the present-day actor a much better sense of balance . He 's not just an actor ; he 's the heart of an organization , and it becomes his bounden duty to carry on in a manner befitting the wisest and shrewdest of businessmen . If he 's not capable of doing this for himself , he has others who do it for him . Rather a big jump from the old days . " I sort of gathered what . he meant . The same thing might easily be applied to the smarter ones who adjust themselves to different types of acting . Like Carole Lombard , let us say . Her usual characterization was discarded instantly when she stepped into her role in the picture My Man Godfrey . Had she been an old-time star , she would have refused the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to do so under her contract , but she 's a shrewd lady and she saw in it a new eye view of herself for the cinema-loving public . I have always contended that actors had the poorest opinion of a story , but if I were to tell you just how many bad pictures that I  --  an alleged scenarist  --  had written , my argument . would n't hold water . Miss Lombard , who started out in life with the name of Carol June Peters , has the unusual knack of sensing a good story . Now and then she 's wrong . She was definitely wrong in her rejection of Spawn of the North , but then , it was a story of people and not just Carole Lombard . I make this third-act charge because it was I who wrote the script , and her decision left me high and dry in Alaska , with nothing to do except dream about a day when I could drown at least six stars in the Tongass Narrows . Personally , of course , she does n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm no exception to the rule . I 've never spoken to her , and possibly never shall , but my observations convince me that she 's a most unusual sort . Her evident protean qualities as registered in My Man Godfrey and her present picture , Swing High , Swing Low , prove that . Some Very Human People Her effect on people is either positive or negative . Like or no like , you 're always aware she 's around . Her use of the English language is not always the choicest , but when you know what she 's done for those who need it , you find nothing wrong with what she has to say . Her charitable instincts are of the magnanimous sort  --  like those practiced by Marion Davies and the late Mabel Normand . They did good deeds well , and that 's my idea of a good woman . It 's a strange business , but a delightful one , and 1 know of no one in the studios more qualified to say that than myself . I 've been fired out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were n't even painted . I 've been connected with fops and outstauding successes , and I 'm still unable to judge which is which while they 're in the process of production . We are constantly striving for better pictures , but more often than not , good pictures are accidental . The spending of millions may assure us of production value , but it does not prevent failures . The story is never any better than the idea behind it , and good ideas are not always the offspring of money . From Fish to Bathing Beauties Mack Sennett once made some sort of reputation as a producer of bathing-beauty pictures . The idea was purely accidental and not a premeditated one , but if there is any credit to he given , it should go to the United States Government . Shortly after our country got into the World War , Hollywood studios began making propaganda shorts for Uncle Sam . Eddie Cline , today a Paramount producer , but then a director for Sennett , was assigned to make a half-reeler on the subject of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie knew it . Fish meant the ocean , and the ocean suggested the beach . Why could n't he highlight the subject with some sort of routine on the beach ? What , for instance ? Well , maybe a game of beach ball with some girls in bathing suits . He did . Mack Sennett and Syd Chaplin looked at the assembled scenes . Beautiful faces and lovely shapes , that 's all they saw , " If that 's not an idea for pictures , " said Syd , " then I never saw one . " " You 're telling me , " replied Sennett  --  and the bathing-beauty picture was born . Accident may be applied to the costuming and characterization of an actor as well . Old-timers in the picture game , such as Raymond Griffith , Eddie Cline , Noel Smith and other ex-Sennett personalities , will tell you that Charlie Chaplin did not come into the business wearing the baggy pants and big shoes . Rather , he wore an English cab driver 's top hat. , a long yellow topcoat with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mustache was of the Desperate Desmond sort , curled at the end like the mainspring in a watch . And his style of acting was of the more aggressive type . One day he was asked to work in a semi-educational sort of picture  --  a midget automobile race  --  that was directed by Henry ( Paths ) Lehmann . Rather than waste his characterization on this kind of picture , he put on a pair of Roscoe Arbuckle 's pants , a Fred Mace derby and a pair of slap shoes . And he 's done very well with them ever since . Also , there are accidental characterizations in a picture . Having been one of the writers on The Lives of a Bengal Lancer , I can tell you that the part of Forsythe , as played by Franck ? t Tone , was not done as it was written in the script . It was done much better . And the reason for it was  --  Tone did n't like the part . He hated certain lines and sappy situations , so he tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an otherwise ordinary part . Later he wrote a letter to the producer and apologized for his criticism of the story . Ideas ! Ideas ! Good ideas ! That 's what counts in this business . A good craftsman can always write a script , but Nature allows him no more than his quota of ideas . The Bengal Lancer was no better than the two ideas that were injected into it by a certain ( Continued on Page 55 ) ( Cantiaaad from Paso 52 ) writer : " Let 's make a Western in India , " and " A handful of British soldiers control three hundred million people . " In Souls at Sea , a picture featuring Clary Cooper and Oeorge Raft , the director commended me for a certain quality I had created between the hero and the heavy . " Cooper 's against Wilcoxon in everything he does , " said the director , " but lie does n't dislike him . I think that 's swell . " So did I after he told me . I had written it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow I had forgotten to put in lines of dialogue that proved the fact . I suppose that 's one of the many reasons why Hollywood writers get paid good money . That would n't have happened in the old days . Having no dialogue to contend with , I would have automatically incorporated visual scenes iu which the heavy put tacks in the hero 's bed , or something of the sort . The reason for it is a very simple one : Then , the plot was the thing , and villainy would have been a definite part of the plot . Today , it 's entertainment , with plot falling where it may . Then , a villain was a. villain and knew it . Today , he seems to be unaware of the fact except for occasional diabolic flashes . When we talk about him in a story , we 're apt to say : " He 's the sort of fellow who investigates doorways before entering , thus obviating any possibility of stumbling over a bear rug . " Or maybe he 's a connoisseur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdened with plot that he had no time to give character or human naturalness to the picture . Let 's take the good old mortgage scene to illustrate . The manner in which he threw the invalided old lady out into the snow was a caution . And like the dyed-in-the-wool villain he was , he wasted no time on trivia , Villain Refined But Not Reformed " If you do not pay this mortgage , " he thundered through an alfalfa mustache that would have aroused the envy of any brush salesman , " by five o'cloek " ? this with a dramatic gesture toward the wall clock ? " I will throw you and yours out into the snow ! " An accompanying sweep of the hands toward the doorway lent emphasis to his last speech . Also , there were snowflakes the size of billiard balls beating down through the opening . A tough situation for the old lady . Today , of course , the villain is much more intelligent . He is almost apologetic in manner and seems to feel the distress of the victim much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we call it , but it does n't keep the poor woman from being dispossessed . The alfalfa mustache is not just a figment of the imagination . Anybody who has ever wound crepe hair around a pop bottle will tell you the boys did things in a big way in those days . And quite often personalities were manufactured for the screen . The producers endowed their leading ladies with names both saccharine and sticky . Lovely , Darling , Love , Sweet , and the like . Those who survived the honeyed cycle did so because their personalities emanated from within and not from any surface application . The leading men , if you recall , wore curly locks , a cupid's-bow mouth , and soft shirts opened at the neck . They were ever-righteous and noble creatures , incapable of doing anything wrong . Most of the writers who wrote material for them are now back in the grocery store , and glad of it . It 's hard to write about men who can do no wrong . As Richard Arlen once said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting all the breaks . He 's having a. marvelous tete-a-tete with a most beautiful girl ; then I dash in and break it up . What for ? " Making a good picture is like betting on a 100-to-I shot . If he hits , you take home the berries in a bushel basket . If he does n't  --  but why bring that up ? The outsider will say , " There 's no reason for making so many bad pictures , " and the insider will reply , " Oh , yeah ? " I 'm afraid I 'll have to string with the insider . The by-line writer of a newspaper syndicate can count his top columns on the fingers of his left hand . If I ask him why he is n't more consistent , he 'll reply with " Did you ever try to write a column yourself ? " A magazine may be punk one week and great the qext , Why ? Certainly the editors did n't set out to make it bad : it just happened . And that 's pictures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good pictures are not always the result of the combined efforts of good actors , directors , writers and technicians . It goes beyond that . Their contracts read " unique and tin-replaceable , " or words to that effect . The better ones are . They have something greater than talent . Hollywood is full of people who have talent , but only a few have " it . " With actors , the " it " quality has to do with their visual personality  --  sex appeal , magnetism , or whatever you care to call it .. Back of the camera , we refer to the ingredient as " umphh . " It 's something that directors , writers and technicians put into their work that cannei be classified as a perfected technique . It 's  --  well , it 's just something . The so-called " it " quality dominate , everything else . We have actors in picture business who would n't even allowed to announce the arrival of the Van Pringles in a Little Theater production , but they 'll fill big theaters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . does n't fall for their charms , and that 's because I do n't like picture shows . I 've never liked them since the day they took out the player pianos . The actor of today , of course , knows the story he 's playing in . He has to , lwcause there are lines to learn . In the silent era , he was inclined to depend on the director . A morning 's work started something like this : " What do I do in this scene ? " " You love the girl , " explains the director . " She 's behind that door  --  that 's a closet . door , you know  --  and she 's about to drink a bottle of nu s vomica , or tincture of aconite , iir something . You batter the door doe ; you tell her you love her . Yon keep on talking till I yell ' Cut . ' " So he batters the door down and he keeps on talking . It is n't important what he says  --  subtitles will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the first things that come to mind : " I love you  --  I love you , Jeannette ! Look at me , my darling . A little more , please , and quit hogging the lens of the camera . Remember , precious , I 'm the star of this picture . Oh , darling , why did you try to kill yourself ? Ten bucks a day is not to be sneezed at , little gal . " The silent camera , however , only ' picked up the eloquent appeal in his eyes and the gentle tenderness in his face . And the amusement it afforded the thousands of lip renders in the 56 THE SfITURD.RY EVENING POST April 10. 00J7 country vanished with the coming of sound . My first healthy crack at directing feature pictures began in 1922 , when Phil Goldstone , an independent producer , asked me to direct Richard Talmadge . The productions were to cost all of six thousand dollars apiece . He offered me a hundred dollars and an interest in the company . I asked for two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty dollars , and he made a fortune and Richard Talmadge became the greatest stunt actor that ever worked in front of a camera . These pictures marked my beginning in Poverty Row . I would n't take a million dollars for my experiences , but , God willing . I hope I may never have to go back there again . Here was filmdom 's Main Street tailor shop , where ingenuity took the place of money and shoddy material was passed off as the real thing . I wrote , directed , cut and titled a hundred pictures for at least half that many producers in this centrally located Death Valley , and I finally emerged with an extra pair of pants and a rather faint hope for the future . The break came when Lou Anger , manager and producer of Buster Keaton comedies , sent for me to remake the last reel of a Clyde Cook picture . Incidentally , it was called The Pony Express , a name which Paramount used later for the feature which brought out George Bancroft . I did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a series of pictures with Roscoe Arbuckle , featuring the latter 's nephew , Al St. John . I was a happy guy . We went to work , using our ideas but Joseph Schenck 's money . Roscoe was working under the assumed name of William Goodrich , endeavoring to overcome the tragedy that had stripped him of fame and fortune . I shall never forget the unwitting remark that escaped his lips one day when we were on location . We passed a dead sheep lying in a field . He threw a thumb in its direction and said to me : " I 'm the only thing in this world deader than that . " . fi Hoosier Philosopher That 's the way he felt about the matter , and yet he was getting a thousand dollars a week . I know a lot of people in the southern part of North Carolina  --  yes , and even the northern part of South Carolina  --  who would think they were sitting on top of the world if they were making that much money . But that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . We made three pictures together and then the enterprise flopped . The quality of the pictures may have had something to do with it , but I always like to think that such was n't the case . It makes sleeping much easier . My dad never lost sleep over anything . Even back in West Terre Haute , when the mines were only working one day a week , he used to sit in Pad Snack 's saloon and play pinochle with a deck of cards that was the size and shape of a concertina . It was no trick at all to squeeze a glass of beer out of the pack , and the fellow who dealt them gave you the impression he was handing out cakes of hardtack . My dad philosophized then oven as he does now . My mother was much more practical . She ran a boardinghouse and supported both of us . In time I grew embarrassed and went to work . My dad soon followed suit , but he never quite forgave me for the manly impulse . Two years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-fledged studio electrician .

During that twenty years , I doubt if he ever read one book on electricity . He confessed to me on several occasions that if he were ever to push in a bull switch and the lights did n't go on , he 'd pick up his dinner bucket and sneak out the back way . I recall a particular time when a new man was put in charge of his department . The man was a sort of efficiency expert and , although a very nice fellow at heart , he felt he owed it to the company to ascertain what each of his employees knew about electricity .

" " An ohm is a place where an Englishman lives , " answered my dad , and walked out . He thought he was through , but he was n't .
