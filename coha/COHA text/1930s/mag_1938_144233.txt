( See front cover ) <P> One warm California afternoon , summer before last , every major Hollywood cinema producer put on his best double-dealing poker face and disclaimed to his colleagues any interest in Authoress Margaret Mitchell 's magnum opus , Gone With the Wind . All knew only too well that any open move to bid for it would send the price kiting . Hence young Producer David O. Selznick was highly pleased with himself when three days later he was able to announce that for mere peanuts ( $50,000 ) he had bought the film rights to the book that was becoming the best-selling best seller in a generation . <P> Before the news was very old the U. S. public was enjoying the zestful pastime of casting Producer Selznick 's picture for him . Before very long Producer Selznick knew the people 's choice for Rhett Butler to be cinema 's No. 1 buckaroo-bold , woman-handling Actor Clark Gable . But the people 's choice for Scarlett O'Hara was far from unanimous . It seemed to call for a blend of gusty Tallulah Bankhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulette Goddard . For Scarlett , Producer Selznick scanned one after another of the public 's suggestions , considered as well young Actresses Margaret Tallichet and Arlene Whalen , Mrs. John Hay Whitney , nee Mary Elizabeth ( " Liz " ) Altemus ( his backer 's wife ) . On his problems Producer Selznick has for nearly two years been pondering . And other studios , expecting that the cinema Gone With the Wind would be a first-rate harbinger for a whopping cycle of Southern pictures , waited patiently for Producer Selznick to act . <P> Suddenly last fall one studio took the offensive . Dust-collecting for nearly a year on the shelves at Warner Brothers had been Owen Davis ' play Jezebel , a drama of moss-hung New Orleans , spiced with the vixenry of a high-spirited , imperious Southern belle of 1850 . <P> For the Warner publicity department , the fleeting points of similarity between Jezebel and Gone With the Wind were words to the wise . Before long Hollywood was buzzing with gossip that Warners were out to steal the wind from Producer Selznick 's sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jezebel 's heroine was an actress largely overlooked in Gone With the Wind 's nationwide parlor-casting bees , but one who came close to what the public seemed to want in Scarlett . That actress was Bette Davis-tempestuous , intense , compact &; casehardened , with diamond dust in her voice , bug eyes lit with a cold blue glitter , and as wide a dramatic range as any cinemactress in the business . <P> In the audience sat David Selznick when Jezebel had its Hollywood premiere early this month . As Actress Davis venomously kicked aside convention , twisted the code of Southern chivalry , bit her lips to make them kissable , patted her cheeks with a hairbrush to make them scarlet , the audience glanced toward Producer Selznick to see how he liked these things that smacked of Gone With the Wind . If he let fall any comments , they fell in private . <P> Hollywood called Jezebel " terrific , " predicted it would slow Mr. Selznick 's Wind down to a breeze . Some wag suggested that the only one who might play Scarlett O'Hara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact was that Bette Davis had gone full sail before the wind .
