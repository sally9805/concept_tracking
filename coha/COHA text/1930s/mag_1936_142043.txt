One day last week aboard the Empress of Japan , placidly ploughing across the China Sea to Hongkong , Commonwealth-President Manuel Quezon of the Philippines began to receive a steady stream of wireless reports . Before the day was out he had proclaimed a " state of calamity , " had issued a decree appropriating $500,000 from the Commonwealth 's scanty treasury for emergency relief . A South Pacific typhoon had just caused one of the worst catastrophes in Philippine history . <P> Connoisseurs of typhoons , the Filipinos thought little of it when one of these lethal storms whipped straight across the lower portion of Luzon fortnight ago . Only ten or 15 people were killed and a few hundred houses razed . But like a man who rejoices at escaping the jaws of a crocodile only to be crushed by its flailing tail , Filipinos began to think differently when the backlash of the typhoon curled back and caught northern Luzon . The fury of the storm had abated but the heavens over the three northwestern provinces of the island suddenly liquefied . Through those provinces-Nueva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , biggest river of the Philippines , due north through 200 miles of rich farming country . The typhoon passed , the rain stopped and then came calamity . The Cagayan began to rise . <P> A constabulary officer , Lieutenant Pedro Dionisio , raced the flood to his headquarters at Echage and telegraphed before the wires went down that there were already 20 known dead in the village of Cagayan . He added : " No reports received from the towns and barrios around Ilagan , as they are submerged . " The postmaster at Alcala succeeded in reporting that the river was six feet over the tops of the telegraph poles . Reports from another village indicated that there were 75 persons missing ; 54 villages were known to be submerged ; people crouching on the roofs of their houses were carried away screaming in the flood . After aerial surveys the Red Cross reported some 1,500 square miles inundated in Nueva Vizcaya , 2,000 square miles in Isabela ; homeless , 80,000 , missing , 1,000 , known dead , 118.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
