At his home in Gloucester , Mass , early one morning last week , after long illness , died A. Piatt Andrew , onetime ( 1910-12 ) Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , since 1921 a U. S. Representative . He was the tenth Representative , the 14th member of the 74th Congress to die . When the House met at noon that day , it would have been customary to adjourn at once in tribute to the dead colleague . But Congress was straining for adjournment by week 's end , and the conventional amenities were postponed for nearly three hours by routine business . Then Massachusetts ' Treadway arose to present a resolution of adjournment . " Mr. Speaker , " cried he to Speaker Joseph Wellington Byrns , " again the Grim Reaper has visited this House . . . . " <P> Speaker Byrns appointed a committee of four to attend the funeral , banged his gavel for adjournment , went home to his suite at the Mayflower Hotel . Nine hours later the Grim Reaper paid another call , and lanky , bushy-browed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first Speaker in history to die while Congress was in session . <P> Joe Byrns was not a great Speaker in the tradition of " Tsar " Reed , " Uncle Joe " Cannon and " Nick " Longworth . But the same big , warm heart which kept him from giving the unwieldy House the iron-fisted discipline it often needs made the onetime Tennessee farm boy one of the best-liked Speakers the House has ever had . Last week the nation 's statesmen forgot his amiable , easy-going leadership , paid heartfelt tribute to his honest simplicity , blamed his death on the conscientious industry with which he strived to fulfill his duties . " He served his State and the nation , " mourned President Roosevelt , " with fidelity , honor and great usefulness . " <P> When the Democratic majority rewarded Joe Byrns 's quarter-century of loyal Party service with the Speakership 17 months ago , the New Deal counted on quiet , able Floor Leader William Brockman ( " Tallulah 's Father " ) Bankhead of Alabama to help him keep that unwieldy majority marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected , did not take over his job until last January . Last week , in its unprecedented situation of being without a Speaker , the House was called to order by Clerk South Trimble less than twelve hours after Joe Byrns had breathed his last . By a plan which Democratic leaders had agreed on few minutes before , Rules Committee Chairman John J. O'Connor promptly rose , declared : " With no disrespect to our beloved Speaker who has left us , it becomes necessary , in order that the House may function and the machinery of government may not stop , that the House proceed to the election of a Speaker . " On Chairman O'Connor 's motion , a subdued chorus of " ayes " made Leader Bankhead 47th Speaker of the House . <P> Down the centre aisle through the hushed House , escorted by Representatives O'Connor , Taylor and Snell , marched the sturdy , grim-lipped , white-suited Alabamian .
