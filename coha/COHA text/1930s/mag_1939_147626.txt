MY LIFE-Havelock Ellis-Houghfon Mifflm ( $3.75 ) . <P> The late Havelock Ellis 's seven-volume Studies in the Psychology of Sex is one of the notable examples of clinical candor in modern writing . When he came to write his autobiography , clinically candid Havelock Ellis tried to outdo himself . Said he , " To do what I have done here has been an act of prolonged precision in cold blood , beyond anything else that I have ever written . " He did not hesitate to rank his confessions beside those of Casanova , St. Augustine , Rousseau . <P> Readers of My Life will find plenty of candor , but not quite the kind of thing they expected . The first 250 pages are dull as dishwater-a long-winded genealogy of Havelock Ellis 's ancestors ( healthy , middle-of-the-road sea captains , churchmen , businessmen , who " neither rise nor fall " ) , of his sheltered childhood , of his innocent young manhood as a schoolteacher in Australia , medical student in London , platonic lover of Olive Schreiner ( The Story of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wifie . " At that time , Ellis candidly confesses , he was 5 ' 10 " tall , weighed 150 Ibs. , had a 23-in. mesocephalic head , an unusually high instep , a long great toe , " scented cheeks , " and his castoff shirts smelled like cedar . He was planning his life " largely and spaciously . " <P> Soon it appears that what was intended as an absolutely honest autobiography has turned into a fearlessly candid biography of his wife . A social worker , lecturer and minor fiction writer , Edith was not ( as Daudet said the wife of a writer should be ) a feather bed . Petite , restless , intense , she scolded at Havelock 's manners , dress , undemonstrativeness , called him a mixture of satyr and Christ , alternated between tantrums and protestations of undying love . " The worst of me is in my tongue , " she reassured him , but once she kicked him in the head . He discovered strong homosexual tendencies in her . Both tried to be broadminded . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you good , " said Edith . ) They quarreled , made up , took extended vacations from each other , wrote passionate letters back &; forth long after they had ceased to live together as man &; wife . At last , ill , frenzied , half-insane , Edith demanded a separation , accused him of trying to put her in an asylum . When she died ( in 1916 of pneumonia ) Havelock recalled with anguish a remark of Queen Victoria 's after her husband 's death : " Nobody contradicts me now , and the salt has gone out of my life . "
