Commonest and dullest trick to make advertising copy seem imperative is the fake newspaper front page . However , when one of Massachusetts ' tireless , keen-eyed radio " hams " spied such an imaginary newspaper page heading a radio tube advertisement in her January copy of the magazine QST , she took a magnifying glass to the tiny glyphs under a headline GOOD NEWS ! Shocked , she tattled to her postmaster that she had discovered something far from dull . He called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Hygrade Sylvania Corp. , which made the tubes , shifted the blame to its advertising agency . The agency communicated hotly with the commercial studio which drew the ad . The studio hotly pounced on a cynical free-lance artist it had hired to do the actual drawing . , but he publicly denied he sketched what the Massachusetts " ham " had found written under GOOD NEWS ! : <P> " PHILADELPHIA-You go and take a good substantial -* for yourself . You can do anything you please for the rest of your natural life . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . . . . " <P> To the President , QST apologized . <P> <P> Obscenity deleted .
