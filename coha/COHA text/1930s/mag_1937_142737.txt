The Nazi-Catholic fight in Germany , brought to white heat by Chicago 's George Cardinal Mundelein who declared that the immorality trials of Catholics in Germany " make Wartime propaganda stories look like bedtime tales " ( TIME , May 31 ) , has this crucial issue : Shall the Reich or shall the Catholic Church educate Germany 's 2,000,000 or so Catholic children ? Catholics hold that Hitler 's campaign against monkish immorality is merely a lever to topple the entire German Catholic Church into a sewer of disrepute . <P> Catholic priests in Germany , to assert their right to train their own flocks , last week prepared to celebrate a " Sunday of Youth " with mass meetings of Catholic youngsters . <P> The Berlin diocese , declaring that not more than 58 of Germany 's 25,635 priests could be suspected of immorality though the Reich had imprisoned for examination 915 ( including lay brothers ) , ordered a pamphlet to be read from pulpits on the " Sunday of Youth . " This was the Church 's reply to a tirade three weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a onetime star pupil of Jesuit priests , perhaps felt specially qualified to speak about the " general shocking decadence of morals ' ' among the German priesthood . <P> Night before the pamphlet was to be read , Munich 's most popular Catholic priest , Father Rupert Mayr , who lost both legs fighting for the Fatherland and has fearlessly lashed Nazi propaganda , was arrested . This did not prevent young Catholics all over Germany from flocking to their churches on " Sunday of Youth . " Hitler Youth Groups were at the churches to meet them , to jeer and catcall from outside while the Catholic pamphlet was being read from the pulpits . The pamphlet made no attempt to deny the charges of immorality- " Weakness and sin have always walked alongside the Church in its passages through the centuries- " but attacked the government for unscrupulously exploiting the .2% of scandal it had found . <P> In Munich after services some priests led their congregations out to defy the noisy Hitler Youth . Fist fights ensued , ten more priests were bundled into jail . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cologne 's anti-Nazi Archbishop , Joseph Cardinal Schulte . <P> Same day at Lneberg Dr. Alfred Rosenberg , most anti-Christian Nazi bigwig , flatly and loudly restated the crux of the holy war : " National Socialism has won the right to take the education of German youth for all eternity under its control . ' ' <P> Adolf Hitler , less explicit though not less vehement , declared : " It is not God who divides us , but human beings . . . . No power within or without the Reich will keep us from going our way to our Future . "
