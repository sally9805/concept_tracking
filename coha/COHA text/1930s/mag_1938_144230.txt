Twenty-three per cent of U. S. citizens have poor eyesight before they reach 20 , 48% before 40 . Today more than 63,000 are blind and 100 times as many becoming blind . Heaviest strain on most people 's eyes occurs during their school days . Last week the American Standards Association issued a new code calling for considerably more light in U. S. classrooms to save children 's eyesight . <P> This report , American Recommended Practice of School Lighting , was based on a study sponsored by the Illuminating Engineering Society and American Institute of Architects . It declared many schoolchildren had so little light for their work that they suffered from eyestrain , irritability , headaches . Even on a bright day children in the darkest part of a classroom may get only five foot-candles , * one-twentieth as much light as those near the windows , and on a dark day illumination of their desks may drop as low as one footcandle . The investigators claimed tests showed children did 28% better in reading when they had a minimum of 20 foot-candles . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offices , and a photoelectric control to turn on lights when illumination falls below the minimum . Because glare is as harmful as dimness , it also advised that glossy finish on furniture and glass tops on tables be eliminated , that pictures be varnished instead of glassed , that desks be shaded from the sun , that indirect lighting be used . <P> But the new code ( which practically doubled the eight foot-candle minimum recommended by the same groups in 1932 ) produced more heat than light . For to pour 15 foot-candles on every pupil 's desk would cost U. S. schools untold millions ( $1,000,000 a year in New York City alone ) . Even before the code was issued , the National Council on Schoolhouse Construction , which was represented on a committee of 15 groups collaborating in the study , had adopted a resolution in convention withholding approval of the 15 foot-candle minimum until " scientific " tests had been made . A member of the committee , Miss Alice Barrows , the U. S. Office of Education 's specialist in school building problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter should be studied by disinterested scientists . University of Minnesota 's Miles A. Tinker pooh-poohed the tests cited in the report , said his own studies had shown no gain in speed of reading in light stronger than three foot-candles . Meanwhile , Raymond V. Long , Virginia 's director of school building , charged that " the study reported by the society has been financed by utility companies . " <P> To all this the American Standards Association retorted that representatives of 14 reputable organizations , including the representative of the National Council on Schoolhouse Construction , had voted for the new code . <P> <P> - Foot- candle : The illumination provided by a standard candle on a surface one foot away . Intensity of light in the sun on a bright day is about 10,000 foot-candles , in the shade , 1,000.
