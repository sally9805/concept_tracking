( See front cover ) <P> This week , in the private hospital where they have lived since they were a few weeks old , the Dionne Quintuplets celebrate their third birthday , an event even more amazing than their birth . Out of three dozen sets of quintuplets born during the past five centuries , the Dionnes are the only ones who lived more than one hour . Legally these five are Canada 's and King George VI 's . But even more they are Medicine 's , for they certainly would have died in the western Ontario farmhouse where they were born May 28 , 1934 , if Medicine had not rushed to their aid . <P> Medicine has controlled their every moment ever since Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe delivered them . Their birthday party this week will be a strictly hygienic affair . They will wear special party dresses with embroidery and ribbons , but their parents Oliva &; Elzire Dionne , their five older brothers and sisters who are to eat most of the birthday cake , will be obliged to wear white cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them has a cold or even looks ill , he will lose his invitation to the party . <P> Unlike any other children , the Quintuplets had to have three birthday parties . For besides belonging to Canada , the Crown and Medicine , they also belong to a tremendous public whose agents pay good money to witness their doings . Three weeks ago for still cameras and four weeks ago for newsreels , this week 's party was fully dress-rehearsed . <P> Current Data . Having reached the age of three , the Quintuplets have graduated from the class of biological sideshow freaks into a more normal human status . Like their tiny little bodies which Medicine helped to grow , their inner natures have now developed to the point where character and personality are distinguishable . Biologically they are not identical Quintuplets ( from one subdivided ovum ) but fraternal ones ( from five separate eggs ) . The 750,000 visitors* who will look in at them during the 1937 tourist season , may value the following third birthday data on what they see : <P> Cecile 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ib . <P> Yvonne 34 in. 30 Ib . <P> Emilie 34 in. 30 Ib . <P> Marie 34 in. 27 Ib . <P> Emilie and Marie each have 17 teeth , the others 16 . They can now brush their own teeth , comb their own hair , dress themselves completely ( except for shoe-tying ) , go to the toilet alone . They feed themselves and for the past month have been carrying their empty dishes from the table to the pantry . <P> Yvonne is the most lively and adventuresome . She regards herself as " mother " ' of the rest . Marie is the quietest and most musical . When Marie " draws " she prefers to make straight , vertical lines . Cecile , the tallest , loves mirrors and red objects . Annette draws in sweeping circles . Yvonne paints spirals and is the most inventive . Lately their favorite game has been biting each other , and they know that the punishment for this is being sent to Coventry . Each has distinct color preferences ( see front cover ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
