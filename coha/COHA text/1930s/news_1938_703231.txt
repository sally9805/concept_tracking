txt This hapless city was again subjected today to raid after raid by Insurgent planes from the base at Majorca . Since last midnight there have been six attacks , at 1:15 , 4 , 7  --  and 9:25 this morning and at 1:05 and 3 this afternoon .. This makes eighteen raids since the horror started Wednesday night . As far as it has been possible to check up , there would seem to have been about 1,300 persons killed and 2,000 wounded . Today 's attacks proved much less sanguinary , since for the most part the bombs were scattered around the outer edges of the city , , particularly on the west aria north , where the buildings are mostly private houses and " the- population is more sparse . - Raiders Remain High The planes are still flying at about . 15,000 to 16,000 ? feet , which is too high for effective bombing of specific objectives . But , since they are merely attacking sections of the city without regard to where particular bombs fall , it is proving effective enough , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb to it all in the course of time until even this great-. t-st of horrors begins to seem natural , like the events in a nightmare . When you pile horror upon horror , it loses its effect in life as in art . This correspondent , to be frank , has spared himself the nerve ' strain of contemplating-:the same terrible scenes today that he saw yesterday . But-let none believe that what was so horrible yesterday was any less so today , except - quantitively . During part of the day government ' pursuit - planes patrolled the sky over ' Barcelona , which proved reasentring ? while it lasted . How-combat ever combat planes can stay up only about ' an hour and a half , and the government needs all such craft it can muster for the desperate situation at the- front . Moreover ; Barcelona is not the only coastal city that is being bombed . Tortosa , according ? to persons who came through there this morning , has - been virtually destroyed : . The city- apparently the final goal of the Insurgent drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it , untenahle. - Tinder , the steady wave ? of bombardments , tension in Barcelona is naturally increasing . The ' nerve strain- has proved so unbearable that many : thontands have moved they consider most precious . How ' ever , ? subway stations are so jammed that they have become dangerous in themselves . With the exception of today and yesterday afternoon , the raids have been from two to three and one-half hours apart . This has led some here to believe that the bombers have been making round trips between Majorca and Saragossa , dropping their bombs on Barcelona en route and loading each time at their terminus . That would be dangerous to do in the daytime , for government pursuit planes could catch them between Barcelona and Saragossa , but it would be feasible at night . At any rate , after two hours have passed , everybody waits and listens for the dreaded sound of the alarm sirens , bombs and anti-aircraft guns . That is when the slightest sound has the people jumping , and when raids come , many become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when bombs started to explode , there was a veritable stampede for the back of the hotel housing the foreign newspaper men , something that would never have happened before . Our hotel has not been so empty since before the government moved to Barcelona , for there is no foreigner staying in this city unless he has strong reasons to do so . Under the circumstances , the American colony was particularly gratified to see the embassy and consulate staffs carrying on work with every intention of continuing to do so unless the State Department orders them out . They have had to move from their offices on the Plaza Catalunya , where the windows were blown in yesterday ; but business is going on as usual at a residence that members of the staff use at No. 7 Avenida del- Tibidabo . This area was bombed last night , since the Insurgents are systematically punishing every part of the city . Nevertheless , it is decidedly safer than the central portions of the city .

It has done much to ease the dissatisfaction felt over the abandonment of Madrid by his predecessors . One could write volumes about the interruption of normal life in Barcelona as a result of the bombings , but one example must do . One of the largest bombs that fell during the 1:55 P. M. raid yesterday partly wrecked a University of Barcelona building . This morning we walked around with Rector Bosch Gumper while he ruefully showed us- the damage . The laboratories for chemical research and teaching got it worst , for they faced the side where the bomb exploded . Professor Deulofeu , dean of the faculty of pharmacy , conducted us around that part , fuming with indignation when he was not commenting sadly on the damage . The wreckage included thousands of bottles of chemicals , windows , tables , doors and everything that could yield under the fearful concussion of 500-kilogram bombs hundreds of yards away . The bombs caused a fire in one of the laboratories , and an old professor prevented a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ether out of the . building before it had a chance to explode . Dr. Bosch took us through room after room with windows blown in and doors smashed . His own office was badly wrecked , but by chance he was not in it at the time . The 700 students who attend the university were out for luncheon when the bombs struck , otherwise there would have been a high casualty list . Among the bombing victims was Anthony Le Couteux , French vice consul , who died from injuries received yesterday . The French Consul General , M. Binet , and the former Brazilian Ambassador , Mr. Pecanha , were wounded . A French consular representative at Vinarox also was killed . - Five of today 's raids were carried out by Italian-built SavoiaMarchetti No. 81 bombers and the other by German-built Junkers planes , says tonight 's communiqu ? . to Tibidabo Hill , on the northern edge of the city , or out to provincial places . Those whose homes were wrecked or had had windows blown in have gone to villages if possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what
