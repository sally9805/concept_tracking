txt Efforts of William Randolph Hearst , through injunction suits pending in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia , to prevent the Senate lobby investigating committee from using as evidence or making public a telegram sent by Mr. Hearst to one of his editorial employes , were frustrated in the House today . Representative John J. of South Carolina , chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs , on a question of personal privilege , read into the record the telegram in question . It proved to be a suggestion from Mr. Hearst to James T. Williams Jr. , one of his editorial writers , that he write a series of editorials urging the impeachment of Mr. , who was described in the telegram by Mr. Hearst as " a Communist in spirit and a traitor in effect . " Later Elisha Hanson , counsel for Mr. Hearst , issued a statement in which he said that the telegram read by Mr. was " not a copy of a telegram sent by Mr. Hearst to one of his editors . " Subsequently Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the Senate committee gave it to Mr. as a true copy . Committee Drops Subpoena Immediately following the reading by Mr. in the House , the Black committee withdrew its ' subpoena directing the Western Union to produce the message . Mr. Hanson said this was an effort by the committee to " evade a review of its action by the courts , " and evidence that the committee was afraid " to meet the issue of its improper and illegal acts . " Practically every member of the House was in his seat when the Carolinian. arose and asked recognition . Time and again as Mr. denounced Mr. Hearst and Mr. Williams , the House cheered . When Mr. read the part of the telegram in which he was branded a " Communist " the House roared with laughter . Following is the text of the telegram as read by Mr. : " Los Angeles , Calif. , April 5 , 1935 . " James T. Williams Jr. , " Washington , D. C. " Confidential . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the enemy within the gates of Congress , 1 the nation'q citadel . He is a Communist in spirit and a traitor in effect . He would leave the United States naked to its foreign and domestic enemies . " Please make these editorials for morning papers . Also make editorialsextolling administration for its preparedness policies , which are its main achievement . Suggest advocating duplicating West Point in Middle West and Annapolis on Pacific Coast " William Randolph Hearst . " Says Black Supplied Copy Mr. announced that a copy of the telegram had been supplied to him by Senator Black , chairman of the Senate Lobby Committee . Senator Black disclosed the telegram to Mr. by direction of his committee . Mr. began with the statement that Mr. Williams and himself were natives of Greenville , S. C. He recalled that the Military Affairs Committee had investigated Brig . Gen. Alexander F. Williams , who was a native of North Carolina , of which State he said the father of Mr. Williams was also a native . He said he did not know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he sought to keep copies of the Hearst papers out of the hands of his wife and daughter because he said " the hurt to them was what hurt me , by having my integrity , ? my honesty , my patriotism , and my loyalty to my country questioned by this little pen-pusher , " He had assumed , said Mr. , that the attacks were personal on the part of Mr. Williams and for that reason he had complained to Mr. Hearst . " I had been charitably thinking , " Mr. continued , " that Mr. Williams was pursuing a petty , personal spite of some sort that I need not recite here , other than the fact that I was getting on the trail of Brig . Gen. Williams from North Carolina , and I thought that when I notified Mr. Hearst of the fact that he would see the danger of allowing his editorial writer to vent his personal spleen , not based on facts . " I know a public man must face the facts . I think I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers are , and as long as they tell the facts on me I know I have got to take it . Says He Gave Facts " I wanted to give them the facts , and I gave them the facts and I had a right to assume that false , malevolent , unfounded , wicked , malicious , personal abuse would cease : but it did not . " It started up under a full head of steam eleven months thereafter because William Randolph Hearst told James T. Williams to turn on the spiggot of venom and of spite and of falsehood and of traduction of character , and charged that I was a Communist . God save the mark ! It seems to be his tactics to charge anything against a man irrespective of the truth . " Mr. was interrupted by Representative Hill , Democrat , of Alabama , a member of the Military Affairs Committee , who said he wanted to cite the fact that Mr. " was breaking himself down working in the cause of national defense . " Representative Short , Republican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in praising the words of Mr. in the interest of national defense . Williams Called " Mud-Slinger " " I thank my colleagues on this committee , " resumed Mr. , " and I am also under obligations to the Senate for giving me this information before it could go out to the press . I want to call attention to the fact that General Pershing the other day wrote a letter in which he commended the work of the Committee on Military Affairs and me personally . One of the finest things I ever received is right here from General Robert Lee Bullard , who had heard that I wanted to recommend the issuance of a posthumous medal to Billy Mitchell . " General Bullard lies now in a government hospital . He cut the statement out of a paper with a knife , trimmed it to a little scrap of paper , and then wrote with a pencil , ' Very , very right , dear Mr. . The army owes poor Billy much and you much . ' " So let little James T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my contribution to the cause of national defense . " I want their testimony  --  General Bullard 's and General Pershing'sto neutralize and wipe forever from the minds of the people of this country whatever vile suggestions have been made by this paid penpusher , this hired minion , mercenary mud-slinger , who takes his orders not from his own conscience and his own brains but from this fiend of San Simeon . " He writes his given orders , he takes his master 's word , he speaks not his own conscience but whatever his master tells him . That is not a free press ; it is a hired , subsidized and a purchased editorial . It is prompted by this arch enemy of free thought , free speech and free government . " As Mr. concluded he was assisted from the House by Representative Bankhead , the Democratic floor leader , and Senator Byrnes of South Carolina , who had come over from the Senate to hear the speech . The Committee on Judicary reported favorably today a bill to control and regulate lobbying . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal legislation . Lobbyists would be required to disclose all material facts as to their employment , including salaries and expense accounts . All individuals , partnerships , associations and corporations would be required to file monthly statements with the Clerk of the House showing the source and disposition of all funds or contributions used to influence legislation . Penalties for violations are fines of not more than $1,000 and imprisonment for one year , or both . A bill similar in most respects , sponsored by Senator Black , has already passed the Senate .
