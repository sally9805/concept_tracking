Few people disputed the noose-worthiness of Anthony Chebatoris , 40 , sneering , hard-bitten little Pole of Hamtramck , Mich , who , with an accomplice , shot two officers of the Midland ( Mich . ) Chemical State Savings Bank , killed a passing truck driver , was captured thanks to the marksmanship of a deer-hunting dentist . Taking life during a bank holdup calls for the death penalty under Federal law . <P> But not since 1830 , before Michigan became a State , had anyone been executed in Michigan. + Governor Frank Murphy thought trying to preserve that tradition would be a popular gesture . With Killer Chebatoris scheduled to hang at the Federal Detention Farm in Milan , Mich , last week . Governor Murphy appealed to President Roosevelt to have Chebatoris hanged in some other State . <P> Franklin Roosevelt asked his Department of Justice to see what could be done to accommodate gentle , faithful Frank Murphy . Federal law says that Federal executions shall be moved only out of States which have entirely abolished capital punishment . Michigan law does demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be moved unless the trial judge knew of a way . Federal Judge Arthur J. Tuttle of Detroit replied : " I have neither the power nor the inclination . ... I think it would be unfair to suggest that people of neighboring States are less humane than are the people of our own . . . . " <P> So Executioner Phil Hanna of Illinois went to Milan . There last week , still sneering , Killer Chebatoris took the plunge that broke his neck . Obituary by Michigan 's Murphy : " Michigan has led the world in the civilized attitude toward criminals . The hanging today was a blot on our century-old tradition , but I hope that it will have the effect of helping to abolish capital punishment from all the States in the Union . " <P> +When hulking , hard-drinking Stephen G. Simmons of what is now Wayne , Mich , was hanged in Detroit in 1830 for beating to death his invalid wife , Hangman Ben Woodworth made such a public spectacle of the affair that public aversion was aroused . Hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , just across the border , Canada hanged a man subsequently proved innocent . Eight years after that , Michigan startled the world by declaring against capital punishment except for traitors .
