ON THE Castilian Plain south of Madrid the closing days of October , 1936 were autumn at its best ? sunny , sharp , with a pale blue sky that seemed to shine . Ahead of the church tower at Getafe , in the straggling little town eight miles from the city , where we were standing at mid-afternoon on the last day of the month , the brown unfenced fields stretched away toward the low ridge over which ran the road to Toledo . There were no peasants working in them , but they were scattered with hundreds upon hundreds of dark figures , some running , some walking . It was like the start of a huge crowd hurrying from a football match . The first of them were already passing the white houses and untidy hen-runs on the edge of Getafc . They wore stained khaki uniforms that ended in inadequate-looking cord " gym shoes . " Each had a blanket ? some were ordinary white ones which looked as if they had been snatched hastily from a bed ? rolled round one shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough sling made of cord . Their faces were unshaven , burnt a reddish brown by weeks of campaigning . There appeared to be no officers , no one giving orders , no sections in any sort of formation , but just a vast crowd making its way listlessly toward the township . The Spanish People 's Army was in full retreat on Madrid . This morning these troops had been holding the center of the southern front , near the village of Parla . They had been shelled and bombed and machine-gunned from the air till they had broken from their shallow trenches . Their leaders had had no choice but to tell them to fall back and reform at Getafe . There was no panic about them . It was difficult to imagine that these men had been face to face with death all morning , and that at any moment a squadron of bombers might come over , bringing the same threat once more . In ones and twos they strolled down the pavements of the narrow main street , peering in the windows of the few shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busses that honked their way along in the direction of Madrid , loaded with light guns and munitions , or cars with worried staff officers . Those who got food from the supply lorries squatted on the pavements , their backs against the white house walls , cutting slices of white bread and opening tins of herrings with their bayonets . Some sat dozing in the sun in the ditches lining the Madrid road . Others had taken up their positions in a line of shallow trenches which had been dug in front of the town near a wooden roadside hoarding which cried , " Stop at the Ritz when you reach Madrid . " But here too was the same slack , tired , unwarlike air . The men dozed in the sunshine or wandered about looking for food or firewood , or read newspapers , which had in some unaccountable way arrived on the scene . Amongst them were occasional militia women . Some looked even more soldierly than the men , with determined faces and rifles carried as if they meant business . But others , in neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vivid lips , added one more touch of unreality to the scene . Yet they too had been under fire all morning , and had been amongst the last to leave , I learned later . It was like a waiting crowd of extras for a bandit film rather than an army fighting a war notorious for its complete lack of mercy . The schoolroom in the main street , which did service as a dressing-station , was busy . A young dark-haired surgeon was amputating the shattered leg of a seventeen-year-old militiaman . A Scottish ambulance pushed its way through the crowded street and stopped . The stretcher-bearers carried in a groaning man . " One in the guts , " the driver commented , in a sing-song Glasgow voice . " Theycertainly. caughtit to-day . Bombed three times this morning and then machine-gunned from the air . That 's what gets them . They run from the trenches and the planes just sweep them down . It 's simply murder at this rate . " As we talked , an armored car , camouflaged with waving reds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On its front mudguards rode two militiamen , waving their rifles to clear the way . Two others clung to the back . At the dressing-station it stopped , and one wounded man was half pulled , half carried out . " God ! Just look at thatl " commented the ambulance man . " An armored car and four men and a driver to bring back one wounded man . How can they expect to win their war ? The heart 's gone out of them , with these airplanes after them all the time . They do n't want to fight any more . They just want to get back to Madrid as fast as they can . " In the stream of passing men I recognized an Austrian Communist , his face lined and his hair prematurely gray , whom I had met two days before . Then he had been cheerful . New machine guns had arrived , and he thought the turn of the tide had come . Now he looked worn out . " Yes , they broke all along the line , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandies from the packed bar . " It 's impossible . No troops in the world could stand it . You lie in the trenches all day while the shells come over , and the bombers and the chasers with their machine guns . Then when night comes and these things stop , you think you 're going to get some rest . But you do n't . You have to be on the watch , straining your eyes in the dark , listening , in case there is an attack . And with the dawn it 's the shells again . You get no sleep , no real rest at all . That 's what gets you down . " He admitted that the heart seemed to have gone out of the men . " They just do n't see the use of standing up to odds like this . Why should they ? They came out here to fight Fascists , but they never see them ? just airplanes and shells . This is n't fighting and they know it . " Toward dusk things got better , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the village street to take their places in the line . In one place a young officer was even getting a section together to march back . Green double-decker busses with fresh troops , waving their rifles and singing out of every window , rushed through to volleys of " Salud ! Salud ! " And a long black Cadillac , obviously bearing someone of real importance ( there were no trade union letters painted on its gleaming body ) came to a stop outside the commandant 's headquarters in the town hall . From it stepped a tall woman with graying hair , wearing a simple black dress . Immediately the men sitting round recognized her , and one cried : " La Pasionaria ! " Still clasping their pieces of bread and chunks of herring , they crowded round her , faces alive with interest . With some of them it was just curiosity to see this famous woman Communist , Dolores Ibarruri , known as " The Passion Flower , " famed for her oratory and her courage , particularly in the days of the Asturian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed immediately the longing for leadership amongst these men . Shattered , retreating , dispirited , they wanted leaders who would help them . La Pasionaria walked up the road toward the line . In the growing darkness broken only by a fiery sunset glow on the horizon , man after man crowded after her . But there was a note of tragedy over the scene . For all her eloquence and courage , what could La Pasionaria do at this late hour to check the retreat ? On that autumn evening it appeared as if nothing could save Madrid from Franco . II Madrid , as the rebels came closer and closer , remained almost alarmingly calm . The city to which we drove back evening after evening , with its crowds hurrying homeward through the dusk , its trams , its lighted shops and caf ? s , seemed a world away from the plain where crumpled bodies lay in the brown fields and under the roadside trees . The caf ? s were crowded with militiamen " on excessive guard duty , " as the papers termed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavements of the Gran Via were thronged with strollers ? men in uniforms ranging from blue , crimson-lined cloaks of the regular cavalry to the rough militia overalls , and neat senoritas in black , with little red or yellow or green combs in their shining black hair . In the Puerta del Sol the old women still sold tickets for the State lotteries , though the crucifixes and rosaries they had hawked in the former days were now replaced by cards of hammer-andsickle badges or red-and-black anarchist caps . Pleasure-loving Madrid did not easily throw off its usual mood even with an enemy moving relentlessly toward its gates . One obvious reason for this attitude was ignorance of the realities of modern war . The Spaniards did not go through the Great War . They have had no first-hand experience of modern warfare on their own soil . Many of them are illiterate , and knew nothing of what bombing , for instance , could mean until bombs began to drop on their own doorsteps . They thought of warfare still to some extent in terms of the street-fighting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The military training posters which were put up on the walls showed this clearly . They demonstrated the most elementary rules of warfare ? that a trench should be dug deep enough to give shelter against bullets , that men should spread out when under shell fire , that it is safer to lie down than stand up when bombs are falling and shrapnel bursting . But to people who , weeks later , were convinced that shrapnel shells bursting in the city were bombs thrown from houses by Franco 's sympathizers , these were new and strange ideas . It was not until the heavy guns on the Castilian plain set the windows rattling every morning that a real start was made with the erection of defenses in the city . But at last gangs of workmen began to tear up the cobbles with picks and pile them into walls across the streets . At the Toledo Bridge women and children formed a living chain to pass the blocks from hand to hand . Little boys dragged stones about in soap-box carts . And workers in winding columns , spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deepen the trenches which had been scratched in the hard soil before Villavcrde and Carabanchel , on which the rebels were advancing . Recruiting squads of women marched through the streets calling the idlers out of caf ? s . Loud-speakers blared appeals at the corners . Banners were strung across the roads proclaiming " No Pasaran " ( " They shall not pass " ) , and " Madrid shall be the Tomb of Fascism . " Through the streets dashed cars bearing in huge letters on their sides the initials of the trade unions ? U.G.T . or C.N.T. ? or names of columns like " Red Lions " or " Pasionaria . " In the very mornings a column of workers returning from drill would march up the Gran Via with chests out and arms swinging with a flourish . But there were few signs to remind one of the battle only a score of miles away . Even the first air raids did little to shake the city 's calm . As Franco 's columns drew nearer to Madrid on the south he sent bombers over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about breakfast-time the anti-aircraft guns on the tallest buildings would begin their pop-pop , and motor-cyclists would dash through the streets with sirens wailing . There would probably be another raid just before lunch , and two in the afternoon , usually about the same time . At first people rushed for the underground stations or the houses where " Refugia for 50 persons " or " Refugio for 100 " had been marked up . But after a few days , when the center of the town was left almost untouched , the crowds took little notice of the warnings . Often they would move into the street to look for the silver shapes of the planes turning far up in the blue . During one afternoon raid the crowd in a cinema sat unalat med and laughing at the jokes of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in The Gay Divorc ? e , though the anti-aircraft guns and sirens barked and wailed above the jazz music . Not bombs , but refugees , brought Madrid at this stage its most vivid impressions of the havoc of war . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to continue for weeks , as village after village and then suburb after suburb was rendered uninhabitable . An old peasant trudging along , weather-beaten head cast down , leading a donkey that pulled a cart piled high with mattresses , brass-bound trunks , buckets , household goods ; two or three children perched on the top , heavy-eyed with weariness or laughing excitedly at this drive into a new , strange world ; a mother in a striped print dress , clutching a baby in her arms : these were typical of thousands . In the Gran Via Hotel or in their homes the foreign correspondents lived comfortably , and felt they were getting good stories without a great deal of trouble . There were interminable waits in the telephone building ? the Telefonica ? while the only two lines to the outside world were used for long conversations with Moscow or for a sub-attach ? at a minor South American Embassy to talk to his mistress in Paris . But there was excellent food to be had at a little restaurant in a side-street ? steaks , asparagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basque senorita to take our orders and pour out the excellent solero . Only at night , when the eleven o'clock curfew turned Madrid into a city of the dead , did one feel the war close at hand . III The black , swift , open Mercedes-Benz must have belonged to a millionaire . It looked like the car in which Hitler drives . It raced along the Gran Via , greenish and gaunt and deserted in the moonlight . Three of us were wedged in the back of the car . It was very cold . The driver and guard in the front were silent . We had met them only half an hour before , when we had been walking home from a late dinner through the empty streets . The big car had drawn up beside us and the guard had demanded our night passes . We had suggested in return that they might drive us back to the hotel and have a drink . They had agreed , and the drink developed into a bottle . ' Then had come the invitation to take a drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a week or two before that General Mola had brought a new expression into the Spanish language by saying that , while he had four columns attacking Madrid from the outside , he had a " Fifth Column " of supporters inside the city , who would rise when he got to the outskirts . With the advance of the rebels this Fifth Column had already intensified its activity . Every day came reports of militiamen wounded at night by snipers from roofs and balconies , particularly in the wealthier suburbs , and of the ghost cars which raced through the streets firing at patrols . The day before , the air raid had been accompanied by the throwing of light bombs from upper windows . One had landed in front of a trade union doorway when the raiding planes were some distance away . Now that Franco was nearing the city the Fifth Column 's hour seemed at hand . " Bring your guns , " said the driver , patting the automatic on his hip . " We have n't any guns . " " What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean that you go about Madrid at night without a gun ? Impossible . " They shook their heads at that . Obviously we did n't know much about civil war . But they took us along . At the first corner an electric torch , reddish in the moonlight , waved up and down . We stopped with a jerk . A muffled guard thrust his rifle toward the car , and muttered in Spanish , " It must be ended . " The driver replied in low and definitely alcoholic Spanish , " It must be ended for ever . " The countersign for the night had been exchanged . Suddenly from the back seat came a sound which , in the silence of the night , was almost a bark . The guards swung their rifles round , their faces tense . One of my companions had hiccoughed . He hiccoughed again . The guards grinned and lowered their rifles . We passed on . As we did so , we heard two shots in a street to our right , followed by a shout . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different parts of the city . We soon learned the reason . In a side-street a window on the second floor of a big house was lighted and uncurtained , an excellent guide to any raiding plane . The driver and guard stopped , and shouted , " Luz ! Luz ! " ( " Lights outl " ) No effect . The guard raised his revolver . With a roar which seemed like that of a baby cannon he fired , drilling a neat hole in the top pane . The driver followed it with two more . We waited . Still the light blazed . " Have a try , " said the driver , handing back his automatic . We put a few more shots at it . By this time three guards , rifles at the ready , had arrived . They hammered at the door with their rifle butts until it was opened by a terrified old man in a dirty dressing-gown . Our two policemen and the guards rushed upstairs . For ten minutes a terrific argument raged in the room . It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the front at dawn next day , and declared they were entitled to keep the light on to pack their equipment . Finally they agreed to curtain the window . We started off again , to be stopped on the next corner by a guard . He approached us , then paused . There was silence . He had forgotten his part of the countersign . The driver roared with laughter , told him , and we went on . " Now , " he said , " we 'll see if any of our friends are at home . There was a militiaman fired at just down here last night . " We had dropped to a crawl at the top of a narrow street lined with luxurious balconied blocks of flats . The driver suddenly put his foot on the accelerator and we roared through , turned at the corner , and raced back . No response . The sniper had either moved or was n't tackling " Q " cars . For half an hour we went on in this way , shouting or firing at lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us , thank God . Then they drove us home , running the car right on to the pavement a yard from the hotel door , and excusing themselves , as they had to go out to the Model Prison . I was glad we were n't asked along for that . None of us was particularly sorry when the trip ended . Those deserted streets and the echoing shots in the moonlight were ghoulish in the extreme . But this was while the attack on the capital seemed comfortably far away . IV At half past seven in the evening of Friday , November 6th , a long dark car slipped out of the gates of the War Ministry and sped away through the dimly lit street toward the Valencia road . In front and behind were police cars ; ahead went four motor cycle outriders . Few people gave the little procession more than a passing glance . Yet had they looked closely they might have seen , sitting in one corner of the car , the short , heavily built figure of Largo Caballero . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of War , discussing whether they should leave or stick to the capital . Through the gray , cold afternoon the debate went on , while the windows rattled faintly to the roar of the guns . The messages which were brought to the Ministry of War by motor-cycle despatch-riders from the front-line barricades and trenches grew graver and graver . During the week the Rebels had made steady gains , until they were at the edge of Madrid . Then came one more knock at the door of the council room . A secretary answered it and hurried back with a note which he handed to Caballero . It was from the commander of the artillery . The shell supply for the Government guns was gravely short . There was only one thing to do . The Government decided to leave at once and hand over control of Madrid to the Defense Council . Outside the War Ministry that evening there were fewer people than usual in the streets . It was cold , cloudy , and verydrear . The caf ? s were half empty . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving their rifles and singing the " Internationale . " A Communist speaker from a propaganda lorry harangued the people round the entrance to a tube station , but few stopped to listen . All wanted to get home to people they knew , to walls that would offer some slight protection against the danger which seemed to lurk in the very air . As the evening wore on the sense of strain in the atmosphere became something almost physical . Those journalists who knew themselves to be on Franco 's blacklist were leaving by car for Valencia in the early morning . The chief censor , who was going with them , showed us the automatic he carried in the pocket of his well-cut suit . In the lounge of theGran Via Hotel , with its bare darkwalls , people talking in low tones sat at the tables . No one knew who might be a spy , noting down information for use when the rebels got in . A chair scraped suddenly back , a door banged upstairs , would bring every conversation to a standstill , cause everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner blared out instructions to chauffeurs and trade unionists to rally to their headquarters , or fervent speeches studded with the words " No pasaran , no pasaran , " rising almost to a shriek . Behind his desk the gray-haired manager , who had known the hotel in the days when tourists and wealthy salesmen had crowded this lounge , went on with his accounts . By the lift an American journalist argued and argued with the censor . His wife , who was a Communist . might well get into serious danger , even if she were sheltered in the American Embassy , should she remain in Madrid . But her name had by an accident been left off the list of those for whom passes had been obtained to leave in the morning . And , war or no war , this was Spain . The official who issued the passes could not be reached at that hour of night . In the morning there would not be time . With infinite charm , the censor shrugged his shoulders resignedly . Nothing could be done . Outwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the swing doors would at first have seen few differences between it and a hotel lounge in any other part of the world . Yet over everyone sitting there hung the threat of death which the Moors and Legionaries and Fascists , now almost at hand , were determined to carry into this city . What fate would the next week bring to these people ? The hotel manager , a good bourgeois : would he be shot for carrying on under the syndico-anarchist committee , running his hotel for " Reds " ? Those militiamen , would they be merely a dark , crumpled line below a white , bullet-scarred wall ? And the American , might not his wife 's safety depend on the outcome of that quiet argument in the corner ? In thousands of homes in Madrid that night families sat round their supper-tables , talking Little . The Spaniards arc great realists . They do not worry overmuch about dangers to come . But this danger was too close at hand not to be terribly real . " At Badajoz the Fascists shot two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , " were the words of a huge poster in the Atocha Square . Arid in their hearts the people believed them to be true . We walked up and down in the hotel discussing what would happen . The rebels were not the only danger . If the defense collapsed , the riff-raff might sack the town before the rebels entered , as had happened in Addis Ababa . The departure of the Government might even be the signal for the outbreak of pillaging . The foreigners could take refuge in their Embassies . But the Embassies were all suspected of harboring Rightist Spaniards , and might well be the first to be sacked . The Americans , in preparation for an emergency like this , had arms ready to issue to their refugees , and had organized rifle and gun positions . The British Embassy , however , had taken the line that a weak defense was worse than no defense . If it were attacked by a force too great for its sixteen elderly Spanish guards , who were armed only with old Italian rifles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting from room to room . The staff and refugees were to gather under the Union Jack in the main hall and apparently trust in God . It did not appear an attractive prospect on that cold , dark November night . Even those who were leaving for Valencia by car had no certainty of getting through . The rebels might cut the road . Outside , the starless sky seemed to come right down into the streets . Guards , with nerves tense , watched every corner . If a Fifth Column outbreak was to come , to-night might well be the night . Crossing the street to the Telephone Building , I was twice searched for arms . As I pushed open the swing doors a revolver was thrust into my stomach . " Hallo ! " said the voice of a guard demanding my passes . I noticed- that the guards in the hallway had been doubled . From all around came the sound of shots . From the distance a big gun boomed at intervals . Behind the hastily constructed barricades and in the shallow trenches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peered tensely into the night , expecting enemies from all sides . Machine-gun posts kept up warning bursts of fire on houses occupied by the rebels . Snipers fired at every shadow . It was easy to believe that the last hours of Republican Madrid were at hand . But there was one thing to happen which neither we nor the waiting world anticipated . V On Saturday the Rebels made further advances at the very edge of the city . The next morning ? Sunday , November 8th ? I was drinking coffee in the bar of the Gran Via Hotel when I heard shouting and clapping outside . I walked out to the pavement edge . The barman and his assistant followed me . There were few enough customers to be attended to that gray morning . Up the street from the direction of the Ministry of War came a long column of marching men . They wore a kind of khaki corduroy uniform , and loose brown Glengarry caps like those of the British tank corps . They were marching in excellent formation . The tramp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders were slung rifles of obviously modern design . Many had scarred tin helmets hanging from their belts . Some were young ; others carried themselves like trained , experienced soldiers . Each section had its officers , some carrying swords and revolvers . Behind rolled a small convoy of lorries , stacked high with machine guns and equipment . At the rear trotted a squadron of about fifty cavalry . The few people who were about lined the roadway , shouting almost hysterically , " Salud ! Salud ! " holding up their fists clenched in salute or clapping vigorously . An old woman with tears streaming down her face held up a baby girl , who saluted too with her tiny fist . One of the charwomen from the hotel stood with tears pouring down her face . The cars racing along the street stopped and blared their horns . The troops in reply held up their fists and copied the call of " Salud ! " We did not know who they were The crowd took them for Russians . The barman turned to me saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But when I heard a clipped Prussian voice shout an order in German , followed by other shouts in French and Italian , I knew they were not Russians . The International Column of Anti-Fascists had arrived in Madrid . We were watching the First Brigade of what was to develop into the most truly international army the world has seen since the Crusades . But Madrid was not worrying who these troops were . They knew that they looked like business , that they were well armed , and that they were on their side . That was enough . The cheering and clapping went on . People rushed up from side-streets , leaned out of windows to watch . Even the first British troops arriving in France could not have had a greater reception . The International Column grew out of the foreign volunteers who had gone to Spain to fight for the Government when the civil war broke out . Many of them were political refugees from Fascist countries like Germany , Italy , and Poland . Others were individual volunteers of Left Wing sympathies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just men out for adventure . From the emigre caf ? s of the Latin Quarter , from poor streets in Switzerland , from offices and even country homes in Britain , they made their way to Spain . Some had to beg in the streets of French villages for money enough to reach the frontier . Many walked over the Pyrenees at night , sleeping by the roadside till they could reach the first Spanish village where they could get help to Barcelona . At first they were scattered among the Spanish militia units , fighting side by side with the ordinary Spanish troops . Later a training center was set up at Barcelona . Newcomers were hastily drafted into the ranks of the Column , and by early November two brigades , numbering about three thousand men in all , had been formed and equipped . The original intention of the Spanish General Staff was to use these brigades as mobile units to deliver flank attacks on Ft anco 's lines from Toledo to Madrid . But this plan had to be abandoned because one factor had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their essential part of the plan by holding the rebels out of the city . The morale of the half-trained Spanish volunteers had suffered severely on that long retreat . So the First Brigade of the International Column was taken from the flank and hurried to stop the gap in Madrid . This first week of the attack on Madrid presented an almost unique journalistic spectacle . We could get much of our news simply by standing at the windows of the Telephone Building . Spread out beneath us , as if on a football field , was the greatest battle waged in Europe since the fight for Warsaw in 1920 . It seemed unreal in the extreme that those figures moving apparently innocently below us were engaged in the business of putting one another to death as rapidly as possible . It was like watching some fantastic puppet game ? indeed , the American staff of the Telephone Company , anxious to avoid words like " the enemy " which would appear to commit them to support one side or the other , talked habitually of the " home side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite vantage point , until the guards in the street below began to take pot shots at us in the belief we were Fascist spies signalling to the enemy . Then we went down to the ninth , where the Americans had their living quarters . Colonel Behn , chairman of the Telephone Company , with that courtesy which Americans are always so much more ready than the British to extend to the Press , threw open his sitting room to us , and even provided us with coffee and his excellent brandy . Below the windows ran the canyon of the Gran Via , cutting through the white modern buildings and closely packed , red-tiled roofs which formed the skyline of Madrid . Ahead , to the west , over the slight valley of the Manzanares , which was hidden by the old Royal Palace and a cinema , was the Casa del Campo . It was tree-covered , with open stretches , and looked like an undulating Hyde Park . Beyond were the needle shafts of the Quatro Vientos wireless station . Due south , the open plain stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the north , over the roofs , showed the red mass of the Hospital Clinic in the University City , and in the distance the line of the Guadarramas , gray-brown against the clear blue sky . Three twinkles , as if someone had flashed a huge electric torch , garish yellow in the sunlight , would come from the edge of Carabanchel . Then three roars , and the sound of crashes at the city edge . " Right in here by the Calle Mayor . See , through the roof of that house . And another just beyond that church tower . " Into the still air the cloud of dust and smoke would rise . A rebel battery was shelling the city . In trenches in the open we could see troops . We watched them being attacked and attacking back . Beyond , against a clump of trees , were horses , which , through glasses , could be identified as cavalry . Dark dots which were tanks moved down through trees near the Casa del Campo . Another battery started from a ridge near by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At other times it was amazing how few signs the countryside showed of the fighting . Lorries passing along the Estremadura road looked like any stream of traffic . Yet glasses showed them filled with troops coming up to the attack . The Casa del Campo looked usually empty . But amid its trees were dug trench-lines between which there was a constant belt of rifle and machine-gun fire . But the air raids never failed to be spectacular . We could count on one or two an afternoon . In the blue sky away to the southwest , coming from the direction of Talavera , would appear four or live dark specks . As they came nearer they would turn into broad-winged Junkers or gleaming silver Capronis . Above would be a flock of tiny escort planes . Almost contemptuously they would drone over the edge of the city , ignoring the few puffs of anti-aircraft shrapnel which burst below them . Many times they passed right in front of the window where we sat , almost , it seemed , within touching distance . We never felt much alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost touching conviction of our inviolability in this Telephone Building . Did not Franco 's supporters own most of the shares in the Telephone Company ? we used to say to one another . They could be counted on not to damage their own property . Under the bombers would suddenly appear a series of dark specks ? three , four , six ; they would fall slanting-wise toward the house roofs . There would come the sickening thud , and smoke would belch up . We would stand waiting for the roar which would signal the engines of the Government chasers . They would suddenly appear , as if released from the roof of the Telefonica itself , rushing like terriers toward the bombers . A few seconds later there would be a furious air battle in progress . Mixed up in the sky like leaves in a whirlwind were fifteen or sixteen planes , diving and turning and swerving around one another . Their tracer bullets drew white chalky lines on the blue sky . Above the traffic you could hear the stutter of machine guns . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane was which . Not even the risk of stray bullets or the orders of guards could keep the people out of the streets while these fights were on . They stood craning skyward , shouting and cheering . The Russian fighters they nicknamed immediately chatossnub-nosed . At last one fighter would separate from the throng . You could pick out two other machines on his tail . He would begin to drop suddenly and uncontrolledly . When he seemed almost to have touched earth , out would flutter a white parachute ? seeming to rise , because it fell so much more slowly than the plane , which would crash in a cloud of black smoke . The crowd would clap and cheer again . They were always convinced that it was a rebel plane brought down by neustras gloriosas aviones . VII The dark zigzag line running over the tawny slope which formed a wide bay ofopen country between the promontories of suburban houses looked in the distance like no more than a field path . Only if you watched closely did you see the small dark figures crouching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly in the blue sky , as if conjured up by a magician , looked like symbols of softness . Even the dark , inverted cones of earth which rose suddenly in the air and fell around the twisting line seemed innocent enough . It was hard to believe that this was a front-line trench , guarding one of the most important approaches to the city . Those gentle white puffs were shrapnel , raining down on men whose only head protection was a cloth-peaked militia cap , and the clouds of earth came from high explosives , thrown on to the trenches from rebel guns . " They 've got the range of it to an inch . There 's little enough shelter in a half-dug trench like that , " said the military expert , focusing his glasses . " I wonder how long they can stick it ? " Day after day in the first week of the attack on Madrid we watched that Line . Day after day we asked one another the same question : " How long can they stick it ? " The trench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before last July , had never handled a rifle . We could see the typical blankets rolled round their shoulders , their rough uniforms . They were navvies , metal workers , tram conductors , clerks , postmen , newspaper sellers ? the people in arms . Few if any of them were revolutionaries by training or desire . Some were no doubt toughs who would boast in bars later of their exploits , who had perhaps taken part in deadly executions at night on the edge of Madrid . Yet Fate had now thrust them into this post which demanded the effort and courage of heroes . On their actions , and on the actions of thousands of others like them in trenches or houses , or behind barricades on the edge of Madrid , depended the fate of the city . The International Column could throw a powerful shock force into the most threatened points ; it could give the untrained militia a lead in tactics and discipline ; but it could not hold anything but a small portion of the six-mile front on which the rebels were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Army was still an all important factor ? perhaps the all important factor . These too were the men we had seen retreating across the fields from Toledo to Navalcarnero , from Navalcarnero to Carabanchel . They had been shelled and bombed out of many positions like this . Their morale was still badly shaken . Would they break here too ? The bombardment went on morning and afternoon , sending fountains of earth spraying along the trench-line . Once we saw a flight of fighting planes swerve overhead , dive towards the crouching figures , loop round and dive again , sweeping the trench with their machine guns . When they had gone the guns took up their deadly work again . Yet throughout the bombardment two horses grazed unconcernedly only a quarter of a mile from the bursting shells . Once we thought the line had reached breaking-point . We suddenly saw dark figures scramble out of the trench and run madly toward the rear , where the slope of ground offered shelter from that raking fire . The first of the men had just got under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . From the rear , two men , lone figures before this running throng , walked toward them . They stopped the first man , and began to argue . We could see their arms raised in gesticulation . The other fugitives gathered round . The shells continued to pound the trench-line . For several minutes they stood there , talking in groups . Then two of the men turned back , and , still under fire , ran forward to the trench and took theirplaces again . The rest followed in ones and twos . The enemy had not had time to attack , The line was held . The men who had gone forward to check the retreat were two of the newly appointed Political Commissars . Whether they threatened or argued or pleaded , they had done their job . We saw no more breaks from this piece of line . One afternoon other figures and two tanks suddenly appeared from behind a rise ahead of the trench-line . Opening out , they charged across the field toward it . The crackle of firing was hidden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenders must have maintained a steady fire , for the attack wavered , and then failed . The charging men dropped flat and crawled away , or ran back to the rise for shelter . On the grass were little mounds of dead or wounded . From time to time two or three dark figures would get up out of the trench and make their way slowly toward the rear . A wounded man was being helped back . The dead they carried out at night . In the darkness as well as the sunshine the line was still held by these unshaven , dirty men , cold and staring under the autumn stars , firing nervously at every sound . They slept when they could , where they were . Their food was brought up under cover of darkness ? stews of rice and meat , coarse bread , coffee . The week wore on . On Thursday night they were still there . On Friday they had gone . They had fallen back on a new , stronger line hastily constructed at the edge of the houses to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this better line could never have been built , and the break through might have come at this point . Had the militia not held hundreds of similar points during that fateful week , Franco would have been in Madrid . But they did not break . The miracle was beginning to happen .
