One dawn last week a few thousand late revelers and early risers stood in the dim streets of Manhattan staring up into a grey-black sky . Across it , her four engines purring smoothly , soared the silvery bulk of the Hindenburg , world 's largest dirigible , just in after her first crossing of the North Atlantic from Friedrichshafen . Germany . A searchlight reached up played over the fabric , came to rest on the swastikas on the rudder . Other lights on the airship twinkled back . Presently the 803-ft. sausage nosed into the haze over the Hudson , flew on toward Lakehurst , N. J. There a huge crowd had lined the U. S. Navy 's vast lighter-than-air field for hours . At 5140 a.m. someone spotted the Zeppelin 's big round nose poking up over the horizon in a pink glow from the rising sun . <P> About the Hindenburg 's trip there was nothing scientifically notable except that it inaugurated the first regular North Atlantic air service , made a record dirigible crossing ( 61 hr. , 38 min . ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded reams of trivial happenings . Most of the 51 passengers admitted they had difficulty remembering they were in the air , so steady was the motion , so familiar were the accommodations to steamship travelers . Dr. Hugo Eckener had shouted : " Auf , Schiff ! " at Friedrichshafen at 9 p.m . An hour later practically all passengers had tired of peering at the lights of Germany , adjourned to the bar . Stewards wandered about with telegrams . A man played incessantly on the aluminum piano . Lady Wilkins had the honor of taking the first bath in the icy shower . By midnight most passengers were abed . A few diehards like Lady Grace Drummond Hay sat up all night . <P> Next morning , after a breakfast of sausages , hot rolls , honey and coffee , came a spasm of postcard-writing . One Hans Hinrichs proudly got off 200 in jig-time by means of a rubber stamp saying : " Greetings from mid-ocean and mid-heaven . " Passenger Murray Simon related his adventures in 1910 as navigator on the airship America , which set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on the first attempt to cross by dirigible . <P> Later on there were flurries of excitement as the Hindenburg passed the Normandie , Europa , Statendam . United Pressman Webb Miller saw three whales spout . At dinner , most of the women , but only three men , put on evening clothes to eat Black Forest trout . <P> Next day , at a portable altar deep in flowers , Rev. Paul Schulte celebrated the world 's first aerial Mass . He ended the service with thanks to " God at the helm . " Three icebergs were spotted in the afternoon . As the ship passed through the cold air above them , its electric radiators were switched on . That night , after most passengers were asleep , the Hindenburg ran through a severe squall , held so steady no one was awakened . <P> Next morning everyone was up in time to watch the sunrise over Manhattan and the New Jersey meadows . Arrived at Lakehurst , the passengers found a rigid customs examination waiting them , finally flew off to Newark by American Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing his ship for the return trip this week . In U. S. papers the happy , goateed old man received columns of tributes . In Germany a Nazi ban prevented his name from being mentioned at all .
