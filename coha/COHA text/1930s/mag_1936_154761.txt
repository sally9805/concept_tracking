( See front cover ) <P> On hundreds of millions of lips last week was the name of a most unhappy woman , Mme Chiang . Four hundred and fifty million Chinese could imagine nothing more poignant than the reported fainting and prostration of Dictator Chiang Kai-shek 's wife as she sat beside a radio in her sumptuous Nanking home and heard her husband 's kidnapper , the Young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang ( TIME , Dec. 21 ) broadcast from Sian in central China that his men had not only kidnapped but also murdered China 's Dictator . <P> The fact of Mme Chiang 's having fainted passed the official Nanking censor of dispatches in English . The chief censor of such dispatches is normally Mme Chiang herself . A most charming , accomplished Wellesley graduate , the Dictator 's wife makes the official English translations of his speeches . He consults her in all things and it was she who drew him into the Christian faith ( TIME , Nov. 3 , 1930 ) . Last week Mme Chiang , her brother T. V. Soong , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. H. H. Kung , who took on the functions of Premier in China 's awful emergency , held the destiny of Eastern Asia in their hands . One false move , they knew , might alter the course of world history to China 's disadvantage , and yet what moves could they make ? <P> Presently the Nanking censor passed dispatches saying it was only the Japanese Domei News Agency which had invented " that appalling falsehood , " the story of the broadcast from Sian having said the Dictator was dead . The kidnapper had indeed broadcast , said the Nanking Government , and the modern electrical transcription machinery of Nanking Central Broadcasting Co. had recorded what he actually said . Before quoting his words , the Government called the Young Marshal and his troops " mere bandits , " declared it was beneath the Government 's dignity to treat with young Chang , and clarioned that for him to be killed by a Chinese process of slow torture known as " the 10,000 Deaths " would be an insufficient expiation of his monstrous crime in kidnapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world its official recording and translation into English ( presumably by Mme Chiang ) of just what the Young Marshal had said . According to the Government he had NOT said the Dictator was dead , quite the contrary , and had then broadcast a concrete program of policy to be followed by China from now on . It was most significant that the Government , for reasons which presently appeared , went to the trouble of translating into English and officially releasing to the world a kidnapper 's program . <P> The " Official " Program of Kidnapper Chang was as follows ( full text ) : " The Central Nanking Government of China has not been sincere in carrying out resistance against Japan . This has been shown by lengthy negotiations and the suppression of patriotic movements . So we must gather our forces , overthrow the Central Government and expedite the national salvation . <P> " China should consider an immediate anti-Japanese military expedition her only national task at present . Therefore we could not wait longer . We want to fight .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
