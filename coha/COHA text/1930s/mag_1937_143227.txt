You HAVE SEEN THEIR FACES-Erskine Caldwell &; Margaret Bourke-White- Viking ( $5 ) . <P> Early in this text- &-camera; picture of contemporary life in the cotton States . Erskine Caldwell observes : " The South has always been shoved around like a country cousin . It buys mill-ends and wears hand-me-downs . ... It is that dogtown on the other side of the railroad tracks that smells so badly every time I he wind changes . " Mindful of the " bad smells " * that have come from the South recently , and with an avowed pro-underdog bias . Author Caldwell and Photographer Bourke-White went down to look things over . After a year and a half of investigation they returned with a skeletonized , unemotional array of case histories , native opinion , commentary and camera evidence on the drearines 's and degradation of plantation workers ' lives that will chill the stomachs of Northern readers , may remove what charm remains for them in Mammy songs . <P> Case Histories : Arnold Berry , Negro field hand and tenant farmer on the Teacher Plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not seventy-five cents every day in the year , but seventy-five cents a day when there is something for him to do " ) , earns less than $200 a year , sinks annually $30 or $40 deeper in debt to the plantation store , is of course forbidden to leave the place until the debt is paid off . He considers himself lucky , however , " that he is a tenant on the Teacher Plantation instead of being a tenant on the adjoining Harris Plantation . . . . He has seen things take place there that he is afraid to talk about . " <P> John Sanford , white Georgia native , 27 years a sharecropper on various Emanuel County farms , once " made enough to buy two beds , half-a-dozen chairs , a dresser , a washstand , and the kitchen stove . An-other time he made enough to buy cheaply a second-hand automobile . The furniture has lasted , except for three of the chairs ; the automobile did not last . He does not own anything else , except a change of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair ; he pulls the children 's teeth when they begin to bother . " Last year he made , all told , a total of $70.48 . <P> Native Comment : From a woman in Troy , Ala. : " We 've been here most of our lives , my husband and me , and I feel like I 'm done for . ... " <P> From a Magee . Miss , landowner : " If outsiders would stop sticking their noses into other people 's business , we 'd get along all right down here . We know how to run this part of the country . . . . We know how to take care of the niggers . . . . " <P> From a Georgia banker : " One of these days the tractor and the mechanical picker are going to catch up with cotton , but by that time it 's going to be too late to help the tenant farmer . . . . What it all adds up to is that cotton has ruined ten million people living in the cotton States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it 's through . . . . Some nights I ca n't sleep at all for lying awake wondering what 's go- ing to happen . ... " <P> Photographs : of a slant-walled sharecropper 's shanty near Rose Bud , Ark. , the rusted-away body of a Ford roadster in the foreground : " I remember when that automobile was a mighty pretty thing to ride around in.
