txt General Robert E. Wood . president of Sears Roebuck &; Co. , was announced as the administration 's principal adviser on allocation of the $4,000.000,000 work relief fund as preliminary skirmishes started in the Senate today on the legislation to provide the huge fund and enact the program . Though technically heading a committee of the Business Advisory and Planning Council to consult with the administration on how the billions are to be used , General Wood was regarded by many here tonight as the virtual administrator of the fund . His selection was announced by Secretary Roper after the Secretary , General Wood and Henry P. Kendall , chairman of the Business Council , conferred with President Roosevelt at the White House . Accepting the appointment , General Wood made known that he had never been approached with a suggestion to head the National Recovery Administration , as recently rumored . Senate action on the relief resolution was calm and formal , consisting of a refusal by Senator , the Republican leader , when Senator Glass , Appropriations Committee chairman , asked for immediate consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . Then , however , some recalcitrant Democrats will move to send it back to the Appropriations Committee with instructions to ear- mark for direct relief $880,000,000 of the $4,880,000,000 carried in the bill and to ascertain precisely how the administration proposes to use the other $4,000,000,000 . Senators McCarran , Clark and King are behind this move , aided by Senator Steiwer , Republican , who assailed the bill this afternoon as a " radical perversion " of the American form of government . Another attack is planned when Senator McCarran introduces his amendment to require prevailing local wages on relief projects , a proposal beaten in the Appropriations Committee by only one vote . Senator Adams is likewise expected to offer his amendment to reduce the $4,880,000,000 to $2,880,000,000 to be expended on a " dole " basis . Pressure to Speed Measure . Senator Robinson , the Democratic leader , refused to predict how long the bill would take to pass the Senate , but it was evident that strong pressure would be placed behind it , especially as Harry L. Hopkins , Federal Relief Administrator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be exhausted within five or six days and that there was no other money in sight . " I think this thing the President is talking of doing is much better than the public works program we 've had , " Mr. Hopkins said. , " If a prevailing wage amendment is finally included , we would either have to reduce working hours , in which case it is obvious that projects would be inefficiently operated , or we would have to pay more for relief . " Functions of Wood Committee . The committee headed by General Wood , will serve voluntarily and without pay , it was stated . Its designation was described as the first administrative step made for operation of the $4,000,000,000 work fund . The plan is for the committee to give advice both to the President and to such administrative agency as he may set up for the fund . Among other functions , the committee will examine projects proposed to be undertaken and make suggestions as to their advisability . " This committee will work in a purely advisory capacity , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocate the funds made possible by the legislation now pending . The thought in mind is to give the administrative body the views and suggestions of business . " The Business Advisory and Planning Council for the Commerce Department has been in existence for more than a year and a half , during which time it has made studies of many important subjects and has given the administration much valuable data that have been made use of in forming the basis of legislation and in various administrative activities . " The committee to be headed by General Wood will function along these same lines and in this way those who are charged with the responsibility of allocating this fund will have the benefit of the point of view and information originating in the business world . " The committee will carry on further intensive studies , up to this time made by three committees of the Business Advisory Council , namely , the private construction committee , headed by A. P. Greensfelder of Philadelphia ; the committee on decentralization of industry , headed by William A. Julian , Treasurer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction , headed by Colonel Robert G. Elbert of New York City . Steiwer 's Attack on Spending . On . the Senate floor , Senator Steiwer , attacking the proposal to grant President Roosevelt authority to expend the work-relief fund , said : " The desire to be relieved from legal restraint of existing law portrays a spirit which is alike impatient of restraint and bent upon the attainment of utter freedom in spending the people 's money . " The Attorney General has cooperated in creating an atmosphere of extravagance and non-restrained expenditures by his advice to the President that ' in his discretion ' means an unqualified discretion . " The appalling possibilities of this situation become increasingly clear . We know that on the less expensive basis of direct relief the government can continue caring for those in distress for a very long time to come . " We do not know and only can speculate upon the length of time the credit of this government will be able to carry the load on a work-relief basis at a cost of four or five billion dollars per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Senator Borah charged that the bill was " vague " and carried no definite plan for spending the money , Senator Long remarked : " When the Senator stands for reelection , he 'll find out how they spend some of it . " " Why bring that up ? " whimsically asked Senator Borah . Senator Borah said that he could not tell whether the money would be used for a " dole " or work relief and that he was being asked to vote for something without knowing what was intended . " The bill is based on the theory that the President will do what he said he will do , " Senator Glass stated . " I am not challenging any one 's integrity or purpose , but I do n't think we can liquidate this relief problem in a few months , " Senator Borah countered . Senator Long thought the measure was a " boodle " bill , and not purely for relief . He clashed briefly with Senator Robinson on how relief money had been spent inr Louisiana .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
