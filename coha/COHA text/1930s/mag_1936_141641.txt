First tobacco Duke to betray an interest in higher education was old Washington ( " Wash " ) Duke who in 1891 gave $100,000 in cigaret stocks to little Trinity College in Durham , N. C. , when that Methodist institution was crusading against the weed he sold . Since then " Wash " Duke 's progeny have made Trinity into a fabulously rich educational duchy . Late Son James Buchanan ( " Buck " ) Duke , who was permitted to rename it Duke University for $17,000,000 in cash , also gave Duke an eventual 32% of the income from his Duke Endowment , whose $53,000,000 portfolio holds not only tobacco but electric-power and basic-warfare-chemicals securities . Late Son Benjamin Newton ( " Ben " ) <P> Duke contributed $2,000.000 more , Grandson Angier B. Duke another $250,000 . <P> In a Manhattan court last week , still another $1,500,000 rippled into the duchy 's coffers , from the estate of Benjamin 's widow , Sarah Pearson Angier Duke , who died last month ( TIME , Sept. 14 ) . Dukes still to be heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his rich and beauteous daughter , Doris Duke Cromwell .
