txt Plea for Needy Children . To the Editor of The New York Times : In a section of surpassing natural beauty , the historic Cumberland Gap region , thousands of children of our oldest pioneer stock are slowly starving . They shiver in the chill mountain winds , barefooted , with ragged , insufficient clothing and with bodies weakened by nutritional diseases . It is reported to me that they are the neediest children in America today . Last year the Save the Children Fund , working in some 200 isolated centres in five Southern States , through the distribution of clothing , made school attendance possible for children who otherwise would have sat at home in idleness . Through the distribution of milk and cod liver oil , health was brought to wan , sickly babies . Through its health centres the ravages of dread diseases were checked and a constructive program of health education indicated . It is difficult to turn a deaf ear to a child . To do so means for the child the lifelong handicap of a blighted and stunted development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this Christmas season to reach out to these children ? Our President has emphasized the need of supporting private philanthropies . The most generous or the smallest contribution will be received with equal appreciation . It will be administered efficiently and economically . ROYAL S. COPELAND . Washington , D. C. , Nov. 23 , 1933.
