The happiest little airplane factory in the U. S. last week was the Aeronca plant at Cincinnati . Aeronca usually makes just two ships in December , but an ex-tap dancer 's amazing stunt had upped December orders 1,400% . <P> At Los Angeles , John M. Jones , who went to Hollywood to be an actor and remained to sell $1,795 Aeroncas , got into his own tiny demonstrator ( 50 h.p. , 90 m.p.h. , 672 lb. unloaded ) , took off with 876 lb. of gasoline and did not come down until he got to New York . It took him 30 hours and 37 minutes and he set a new non-stop distance record for planes of this size . Total operating cost : $30.91 . Cheapest bus fare for the trip : $42 . <P> American Airlines furnished Jones with his gas ( twelve times the normal load ) , oil , food , hotel suite , weather and compass course . Jones furnished American Airlines with good publicity for its southern low altitude route across country . Like the misdirected Douglas Corrigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his plane at airfields which dot the American Airlines route . He will probably sell a lot more Aeroncas when he gets home , having proved that , with a pilot at the stick who does n't need much sleep , baby ships need not be confined to the environs of their airport cribs.
