The men behind news cameras are trained to be as impassive , as mechanically efficient in time of crisis as surgeons or telephone girls . By hook or crook they must get that picture . Last week to the venerable dean of Paris news photographers , Louis Piston , came the opportunity to crown his adventurous career by photographing the assassination of the President of the Republic . <P> Long years ago the future President Paul Doumer attended the wedding of the future dean of Paris cameramen . Last week it came about that bearded Photographer Piston was standing with his flashlight upraised , his camera trained on the patriarchal President at the precise instant when a tall , burly Russian bounded forward and fired point-blank at M. Doumer with a Colt pistol . Instantly dropping his flashlight , Photographer Piston wielded his camera like a club , beating the assassin over the head , stunning him momentarily-and throwing away the chance to make a Picture of the Century . <P> That act was significantly French . By law and by custom the honor &; dignity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France-to an extent undreamed of in most other republics . It is a crime against the State to print jokes about the President of France or to disparage him from stage or platform . Frenchmen-as individuals and as a nation-were never more true to French traditions than in their instinctive , automatic reactions to the swift , tremendous tragedy of last week . Every moment of the 13 hours that passed between the shooting in mid-afternoon and the Death just before dawn was packed with drama . <P> <P> Yet in a strange , sardonic sense the tragedy dated back to a day last May , the day on which Paul Doumer was elected President , a triumph which broke the heart of his far more famed rival and onetime friend , Aristide Briand . On that day victorious President-Elect Paul Doumer said : " It is strange how often the number 13 has arisen to the surface in my long political life . Not only have I just been elected 13th President of France on the 13th day of May , but the last two digits of this year 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider 13 my unlucky number , and I can give many other examples of its appearance . For example , when I proceeded to my post as Governor of <P> Indo-China . I reached Saigon on the 13th day of the month and Hanoi on the 13th of the following month . And certainly no unlucky happening followed either of those two thirteens ! " <P> On the Friday of M. Doumer 's assassination events moved thus : <P> 2:30 p. m. : The 75-year-old President , who lost four of his five sons in the War , left his Elysee Palace to sponsor a sale of books by French War Veterans . In the limousine beside ancient M. Doumer rode alert , bristle-bearded Novelist Claude Farrre , President de la Socit des Ecrivains Combattants who were staging their " War Veterans ' Book Afternoon " in the nearby building of the Rothschild Foundation . Book sales were proceeding briskly and Novelist Farrre 's wife Henriette had just succeeded in selling a third book by her husband to the brawny Russian in dark glasses who loitered beside the Farrre book booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autograph these books for me when he comes , yes ?
