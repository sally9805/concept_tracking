PITCAIRN 'S ISLAND-Charles Nordhoff &; James Norman Hall-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> By the law of the sea , wrecks belong to the salvager . Few readers of 1954 would protest the claim of Salvagers Nordhoff &; Hall to the Bounty , beached by mutineers on Pitcairn 's Island in 1789 . Others had been there before them , but Authors Nordhoff &; Hall did more than strip the wreck of what was left . Bit by bit they salvaged or reconstructed every piece of the Bounty 's history . Last week they finished the long job : in Pitcairn 's Island they gave the third and final chapter of this magnificent true story of the sea . ( Others : Mutiny on the Bounty-TIME , Oct. 17 , 1932 ; Men Against the Sea-TIME , Jan. 15 . ) <P> In December 1789 , eight of the Bounty mutineers , under their leader , Fletcher Christian , with 18 Polynesian natives , landed on Pitcairn 's Island .

" Principal causes of dissension were women and liquor . There were not enough women to go around ; when one of the colony made a successful still , there was too much liquor . First death was a woman 's suicide , in protest at her man 's unfaithfulness . When the native men , justifiably angered at the whites , started a surprise massacre , all the native men were killed , most of the whites . For a time after this civil war the remaining men lived in a stupor of alcohol and unbridled miscegenation ; then the women turned against them , cornered the supply of muskets and shut themselves into a stockade . The male survivor of this Lysistratian war was finally reconciled , became the patriarch-consort of the island . When a Yankee ship put in to Pitcairn 's Island in 1808 , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of the French Revolution or the Napoleonic Wars , but most of them were happy .
