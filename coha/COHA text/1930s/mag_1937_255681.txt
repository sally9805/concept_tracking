The English language owes a debt of incalculable size to Buncombe County , N. C. for a fine eight-letter noun that aptly identifies certain types of insincerity . The U. S. Senate owes a debt of questionable size to the same county for Senator Robert Rice ( ' ' Roarin ' Bob " ) Reynolds . Last week Washington newshawks had fun with an incident that concerned Bob Reynolds and somehow seemed to recall the name of the county of his birth . <P> Word went around that an advertising representative of American Tobacco Co. had persuaded ten U. S. Senators to endorse Lucky Strike cigarets at $1,000 an endorsement . Newshawks scurried here &; there buttonholing Senators to pin the story down . They made a lucky strike when they ran into North Carolina 's Reynolds . Senator Reynolds , never one to hide his light under a bushel , admitted that he had endorsed Lucky Strikes , collected $1,000 . Newshawks were surprised for two reasons : 1 ) most North Carolinians smoke Camels , their State 's most famed product , as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds smoke any brand but Camels . Senator Reynolds admitted that he smoked Camels but he assured questioners that he did smoke and enjoy Lucky Strikes on occasion . No other Lucky Strike-endorsing Senator would speak up but that there were more was clearly indicated one night last week when smart , socialite Alice Roosevelt Longworth commercialized herself in Washington over a nation-wide Lucky Strike radio hookup . Mrs. Longworth set a new high of some kind when she described the superior clarity with which the voices of Lucky Strike-smoking Senators could be heard in the Senate gallery . <P> Whether Bob Reynolds achieves national publicity in cigaret advertisements or not , he had the satisfaction last week of kissing glamorous Jean Harlow before Washington press cameras ( see cut ) .
