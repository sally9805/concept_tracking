Five years ago smart , eccentric Irving Salomon , president of Michigan City , Ind . ' s Royal Metal Manufacturing Co. , looked at his annual business ( manufacturing chrome-plated metal tubular furniture ) and found it about right : $100,000 profit on $1,500,000 gross . He decided to hold it right there , to take no business over that amount , never to be lured into the risks and discomforts of expansion . Through Depression II there were no layoffs at his $580,000 plant . And every year since 1934 Royal 's net has just topped $100,000 . <P> Only once did he break his quota , in 1937 when rising prices forced him to hike it $200,000 to keep his unit production constant . Even so , he turned down at least $150,000 worth of business that year . But never has he turned down so much business as lately-$300,000 worth in one month-for something has happened to the furniture industry . <P> Not yet have France and Britain begun buying bedroom suites for the Maginot Line . The something which has happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 began with subnormal inventories and an incipient home building boom . Last spring , with builders turning out nearly twice as many new homes as in 1938 , furniture makers prepared for a rise . This fall , in spite of World War II , it blew in . <P> Up 28% over August were September orders . Better yet , for the first time in ten years October bookings equaled September 's , topped 1938 by 25% , put the ten-month average 21% over last year . By month 's end unfilled orders were 51% above 1938 . <P> But in spite of their boom , furniture manufacturers were not cheery . They believed that retailers were stocking up faster than the public was buying . They feared that raw material prices would rise , boosting prices and nipping the industry 's little boomlet . They gloomed that if World War II brings increased construction costs , new home building will suffer . All the same , 1939 household furniture sales should exceed $400,000,000 for the first time since 1937 ( $472,000,000 ) .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
