txt On April 26 and May 3 France went to the polls . When the votes had been counted the Popular Front , made up of Communists , Socialists and Radical Socialists , had won a great victory . Leon Blum 's Socialist party had become the strongest single group in the French Chamber . The workers and peasants of France celebrated their great victory ; to them the vote was the triumph of the French Republic over its Fascist enemies . Late last week the Popular Front , minus the Communists who refused to participate , formed the government , with Leon Blum as Premier . Mr. Blum is the first Socialist to hold the job which Clemenceau , Poincare and Briand had filled before him . Yet at the same moment he was taking office the workers of France went on strike . The normal life of the great industrial cities  --  Lille , Rouen , Nantes , Toulouse , Lyons and Marseilles  --  was disturbed . Paris also was affected . Deliveries of goods ceased ; department stores closed ; factories shut down ; newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no bloodshed ; in fact , the strikers , 1,000 , - 000 strong , showed good humor . The strikes were of the sit-down variety . Strikers did not leave their plants ; instead they locked the doors against outsiders and camped within factory walls . Less Work , More Pay The strikers demanded a forty-hour week with pay on the basis of fortyeight hours ' work , union recognition , dismissal allowances and the abolition of overtime . Employers broke off negotiations with the strikers ; they declared the strikes were a revolutionary movement fostered by the new Left government and by Communists . Friday Mr. Blum jumped into the breach . He ' made a radio speech in which he told the country to " keep cool . " He promised a " great future for the French democracy . " Yesterday he told the French Chamber that he would introduce bills next week providing for the forty-hour week , collective bargaining and paid vacations . At the same time he replaced Jean Tannery , Governor of the Bank of France , with Emile Labeyrie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rightists launched a violent persona attack on the new . Premier , who walked out of the Chamber , to return later . Leftists gave him an ovation . ( Leon Blum Prepares a New Deal : p. 3 . ) Royal Hats It has been long since the women of Britain could turn to their royal family for hints on hat fashions . In the lively days of Edward VII Queen Alexandra wore handsomely those wide-brimmed creations set off with ribbons and rosettes , and fresh from Paris . But during Queen Mary 's quarter-of-a-century none of her subjects could carry off her unique favorites with just her regal touch . Now the pendulum has swung back . From London last week came word that the Duchess of Kent , who is the former Princess Marina of Greece and a daughter-in-law of the Queen , is setting the styles in hats . Parisian milliners rush their latest ' art to her . Whenever the Duchess appears in public she wears a new hat , and London designers take their cue from her . It is Queen Mary 's claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Queens . Her taste is standarized ; it seeks comfort , eschews black and prefers pale shades , Winter or Summer . The hat must be a toque , perched loftily on the head like a crown . Once the Queen 's sartorially minded young sons felt that she was behind the times , but now she has become a law unto herself and satisfactory to every one . Your Briton could not visualize her without the gold-headed umbrella or cane , hydrangea-colored town suits , light lizard slippers and haughty toque . Her sons , especially the King and the Duke of Kent , have been most successful setters of men 's fashions . When Edward was Prince of Wales , he favored a pullover sweater , which is said to have brought prosperity to English knitters ( until machines were invented to manufacture the garment ) . There was one bit of apparel , however , that he could never make fashionable ? the straw hat . Recently Edward appeared in Chelsea wearing a.straw ( the English call it a " boater " because people on boating trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . But last week London reported that the stock was still on hand . Whether approved by Prince or King , the straw is not popular with Londoners . The weather , which is never consistently warm and dry , is blamed . Hail and Farewell On a July day twelve years ago Ras Tafari , Regent of Abyssinia , a slight olive-skinned man with raven curls and a silken beard , arrived in London as the guest of the British Government . A Channel steamer , escorted by destroyers , had been chartered for him and his retinue of thirty princes . At Dover a Prime Minister and a Prince had met him . All the way to London bewigged and berobed Mayors had welcomed him ; and in Buckingham Palace he met King George , to whom he presented two lions . Last Wednesday the slight dark man arrived in London again . Between the two visits he had become an Emperor and had lost his empire . This time neither royalty nor officialdom greeted him ; he arrived incognito , bowed and sad , with his children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station thousands of Londoners cheered him : " Haile Selassie ! Long live the Emperor ! " Embarrassing Visitor Despite the show of popular sympathy it was apparent that Haile Selassie 's mission in England would be a difficult one . As a private citizen on neutral soil he could hardly carry on agitation against the Italians . without embarrassing the British Government . And there were indications that the British Government was doing its best to come to an understanding with Italy ? to drop the whole Ethiopian matter in preparation for something bigger that might happen in Europe . Official London , a bit worried about what to do with Haile Selassie , had FEATHER frV Times Wide World . The Duchess of Kent sets styles in hats for women of England , but the men spurn King Edward 's " boater. " other worries , too . In Palestine the Arab agitation continued , with resultant death to a number of police , Arabs and Jews . Rumors persisted that Italian propaganda had stirred up the unrest , and there were increasingly forceful measures by the British military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geneva , London had to map its tactics for the approaching session of the League of Nations . Behind the scenes , it was rumored , England and France were bickering to drop sanctions against Mussolini , provided he would guarantee to maintain the present status of Central Europe and the Mediterranean . Some credence was lent to this report by the return of Sir Samuel Hoare to the British Cabinet on Friday . He succeeded the retired Viscount Monsell of Evesham as First Lord of the Admiralty . Sir Samuel , with the cooperation of Premier Laval of France , proposed last December that half of Ethiopia be handed over to Italy in return for peace . British public indignation over such a " reward to the aggressor " forced Sir Samuel 's resignation as Foreign Secretary and his replacement by Anthony Eden . Now he returns with his prestige somewhat restored and Mr. Eden 's impaired because of the League 's failure to halt Mussolini . Dilemma for- Chiang Ten years , ago next , month General Chiang Kai-shek left Canton at the head of the Nationalist armies to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not unify China . Japan separated ' enormous segments in the North . Meanwhile the Southern government at Canton became increasingly distant to Nanking . Last week there came reports that it was sending an army northward , determined to op-. pose further Japanese aggrandizement and to depose Chiang if he stood in the way . At Nanking there were all sorts of explanations for these reports . Some officials said they were false . Some said the anti-Japanese slogan was merely a pretext for breaking with Chiang . Others said Japanese intriguers were behind it . But any way one looks at it , it looks bad for Generalissimo Chiang . If he fights the Southerners , the Japanese will have a freer hand in the North . If he heeds their demand to send armies North against Japan , the Southern armies will be able to dominate Nanking . If he does nothing , Japan may use the Canton anti-Japanese movement as a reason for going to war in earnest .               @ @ @ @ @ @
