In 1590 Galileo stood on a balcony of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and demonstrated that things of different weight fall at the same rate , that whatever is dropped first lands first . A similar law governs naval races . Nations which start in front tend to stay there . So when Japan last week announced that within six years she planned to have a fleet " equal to that of the strongest naval power , " no one took her very literally . <P> The new plan , as outlined to the Tokyo Diet 's Budget Committee by Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai , will provide $329,177,940 over a period of six years to supplement building now going on . The Admiral said that latest plans of the U. S. and Britain had been taken into account in mapping the program , and provision made for increases in case those countries should further jack up their building rate . <P> Just now that rate of armament is so high that Japan will have to strain hard not to lose ground . In fiscal 1939 Great Britain is spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan $16,420,950 . Even allowing for the amount Japan saves on cheap labor and building costs , her present program is far from " equal to the strongest . " Neither Britain nor the U. S. has planned six years ahead , but all indications are that at the end of that time their relative strength to Japan will be just about what it is now : Britain has an estimated 2,000,000 tons of seagoing strength , the U. S. 1,750,000 , Japan about 1,200,000-roughly a ratio of 100-85-58. * Except for the slight lag of the U. S. behind Britain ( which has always existed ) , this is the famous 5-5-3 ratio set by the Washington Naval Treaty way back in 1922 . The Law of Naval Races having held good for 17 years , the next six are not apt to see it broken . <P> Even if Japan could catch up , it probably has no desire to . All Japan needs is a navy strong enough to meet any power in Japan 's own waters . So far , there is no indication that Britain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western Pacific tonnage greater than the total Japanese tonnage . But the chief effect of Japan 's naval ambitions is to encourage qualitative rather than quantitative competition from the other powers . Example : Having heard rumors that Japan is building two giant battleships of between 40,000 and 46,000 tons , the British forthwith planned the Lion and Temeraire , each 40,000 tons , and the U. S. drew plans for two 45,000-ton battleships , most powerful in history . <P> <P> * On this basis Italy 's present stand is 34 , Germany 's 25 , and Russia 's 22.
