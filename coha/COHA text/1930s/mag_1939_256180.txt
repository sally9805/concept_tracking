" Senso wa zuibun aku-eikyo wo atae-ta , " said many a Japanese citizen in private last week . The sentence had to be said in private because it was a grave admission : " The war hits us pretty heavily . " The Japanese have come to realize all too well that their adventure in China is now primarily a currency war rather than an orthodox military engagement . Last week they began to take official notice of the fact that in the currency war , China has both natural advantages and allies with cash , while Japan has neither . <P> According to Tokyo 's Nichi Nichi , Japan 's Cabinet finally concluded last week that " overwhelming military victories " were insufficient to offset the constant flow of foreign money and materiel into China .
