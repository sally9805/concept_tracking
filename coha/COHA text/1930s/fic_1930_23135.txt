PAM CORPORAL HUMPIT OF THE 4TH MUSKETEERS A STORY BY H. R. WAKEFIELD OW , I do n't know the name of that city and I do n't even know in what country it is , or how I got tl ere or how I slipped away from it . And . I do n't believe that country is on any map , and all the better , say I. And you people who make maps , you 'd better be careful . For very likely the people of that land will come and boast some Tall Tales to you and try to persuade you to put that country on your maps . Maybe they 'll say they have a line of hills there , not one of them less than a hundred thousand feet high , and that they trip to the top of them and down again before breakfast every morning . And that they 've a river , they may call it Drumbole , a thousand miles across from bank to bank , and that near its mouth where it sucks the salt from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the spring the sea-serpents intertwining amorously their long necks together , and presently the shores blazing with the shimmer from their big square eggs , weighing each a ton  --  or so they 'll tell you . And do n't believe what they say about the lake they have , deeper than from earth to moon , full of whales like summer clouds , and fishes big as mammoths with fins upon their flanks , and Grumbals and Ferodons , bigger still . No , you cartographers , do n't believe these tales and do n't allow this country on your maps , for it 's not a land to be encouraged . I 've said I do n't know how I reached this land or how I slipped away from it , but I do know I was standing in that great square , just as the clock of St. Nero 's was thumping out twelve strokes , a sullen , steady patter of inter-echoed throbbing . And I thought I was alone there . But the moon strained itself past the fine campanile of St. Nero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was light as day could ever be in that land , and more than bright enough for me to spy a shifting shadow which flicked in from a street  --  maybe not a street  --  but round a corner into the square , and , head down , staggered droopingly and desperately somewhat in my direction , seeking sanctuary in St. Nero 's , it seemed to me . He had n't gone ten yards before the others were at his heels  --  a pack of them , swinging menacingly such a little way behind him and gaining upon him . As he staggered , they gained and they caught him within ten yards of St. Nero 's . They got round him and how they beat him , that bedraggled posse , clad in gray and rotting rags . Some were hobbling and swaying as they lashed out with their crutches ; some armless , swung their broken boots to good purpose ; and others might have been blind from the way they ran round with their arms outstretched and groping till they found a grip on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way I found it hard to watch . How he dodged , how lie swerved , struck back feebly , round and round the square for me to see , and those after him , and presently he slipped and fell , and 401 ? 1 ? ? ? ? CORPORAL HUMPIT OF they swooped upon him . I can tell you , I was glad when he squirmed through that pack and hurled himself through the great door of St. Nero 's . And then a shadow popped past me and settled itself a yard or so ahead of me and a Voice said , " Do n't look round ! I 'm not going to hurt you . What did you think of that little affair ? " " I should n't care to see it every day . " " You could n't . It happens only once a year , " said the Voice . " Who were those figures in gray ? " " Have a guess . " " They had a look of soldiers about them . " " And so they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Voice . " And they 've certainly been in the wars , have n't they ? Not a whole body among them . They come from the Soldiers ' Cemetery on the Triskan Road . " " And who was the one they hunted and beat ? " " You 'd never guess that , " said the Voice . " Now , if you promise not to look round , I 'll tell you all about him . Some years ago we had an argument with our good neighbors across the frontier . I forget what it was all about . So we went on killing one another for a year or two , and then we got bored with it . I forget who won . Anyway , when it was all over , our King was so poor that he had to sell his collection of Ferodons and Grumbals ? " " And what may they be ? " And then the Voice told me such a story of how big they were and how they lived in that lake and those hills above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which went that river whose banks were white with sea-snakes ' eggs in springtime that I told him to go on with his tale . " Well , " said the Voice , " the King could n't afford another such war so he started ' Never Again Day ' which is celebrated on the anniversary of the day the war ended . And a busy day it is ! First thing in the morning , the warning bombs are fired , and over come the Sky-ing  --  is a courage-inducing fluid kept in jars and issued to soldiers when heroic feats have to be performed . Humpit had secured this office through sheer force of character , and after all his men had been supplied , he emptied the jar , with the result that he subsequently committed deeds of infinite military value of which afterwards he had no recollection whatsoever . And each time the tale of his achievements was printed in the Gazette and he got the Order of Valor again , he read the few laudatory and soldierly lines with considerable surprise and , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had the next morning ! Now , when the King went forth to war and was given an admirable King's-eye view of the area of hostilities from an eminence and through a powerful telescope , he demanded that Corporal Humpit should be presented to him . Hurriedly and inadequately freed from trench vermin , he was ushered into the Presence . " ' Corporal , ' said the King , ' you are a great credit to your country and a mighty scourge to its foes , and I consider it extraordinary that you have earned the Order of Valor twenty-nine times , and no other of my soldiers more than twice . ' " ' Yes , Your Majesty , ' replied Burn-pit , ' it is rather rum . ' " ' And what , ' asked the King , do you consider the qualities most necessary to the modern soldier ? ' " ' Influential friends in the War Department , ' replied the Corporal , ' and acute varicose veins . ' " Whereupon the King dismissed him and had one of the worst coughing attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishly shoved his face in front of a machine gun . " So Old Cornuble , the caretaker of the Soldiers ' Cemetery , was told to scratch up Humpit and send him along in a casket to the War Department . " ' I 've got a general , ' said Old Cornuble ; ' had n't I better send him ? ' " If it were known you 'd sent a general , ' he was told , ' it would imperil the dynasty . ' " Now the old man was lazy and rheumaticky , so he told his assistant , Vashta , to do the job . Now this Vashta had had extracted from his face twenty-four pieces of bomb , and when any child got a close look at him it uttered a yell and took to its heels . This soured him and he was feeling unusually sour as he trundled off with his horse and cart and the casket in it , for that very morning two young girls visiting the cemetery had seen him and one had nudged the other and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he 'd understood what she 'd meant . " Suddenly he remembered that some time before he had earthed a fellow named Vladimir Pannekin , who 'd been a nasty mess when the firing-squad had finished with him . He 'd been a very cheap spy , and his information quite valueless . Now , Vashta in his sour mood thought what a joke it would be to dig up this Pannekin instead of Humpit and shove him in the shell . Panne-kin had been hastily trundled into a shallow hole , dug in a piece of unconsecrated and swampy ground , so Vashta took his spade and dug around . After fishing up a brace of suicides and a murderer , he discovered Pannekin at last , looking much the worse for wear . He bundled him into the casket and trundled back to Old Cornuble who sent it to the War Department and signed a paper to the effect that it was Humpit . There the shell was placed in a fine coffin with gold handles to it , and eight years ago on Never Again Day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls there were and muffled drums and funeral marches and speeches before they lowered Pannekin into the great vault , while eight princes held his pall . It was a big change for him . Instead of six shallow feet in an unhallowed midden , a roomy , dry house in a fine church , surrounded by his peers , the Great Ones , instead of having his right big toe in a gunman 's eye . CORPORAL IIUMPIT OF ' THE 4TH MUSKETEERS 413 " And then the rumor started  --  no one knew how  --  perhaps Vashta babbled in his cups , but anyhow , very soon everyone was whispering and hinting that it was really traitor Pannekin and not gallant Humpit who lay beneath the central aisle of St. Nero 's . Such rumors have ever a gale behind them , and soon this one was blown to the steps of the throne itself . So the King made inquiries . Old Cornuble was questioned and had to confess he had disobeyed his orders and that Vashta had done the job . It would n't have done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cuts with his cane that the old boy danced like a bear . Then the King sent for Vashta and asked him whom he 'd dug up . ' Vladimir Pannekin , ' said Vashta . So he was taken to a room in the State prison , and in one corner was a fellow with a cauldron of oil so hot it sang like a kettle ; and in another corner a big negro was fixing straps to a wheel ; and in another was a rat in a box . And in the fourth corner was a coffin . " And then the King asked Vashta again whom he 'd dug up , and Vashta had a look round and then he said , ' Corporal Humpit of the 4th Musketeers . ' " ' Then make your mark at the bottom of this paper , ' said the King and gave him such a cut with his cane that he doubled up till the back of his head tapped the floor . Then the King issued a proclamation which said that certain disaffected persons had attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humpit but another . This was a treasonable lie , and ex-soldier Vashta , who had carried out the exhumation , had sworn to this . Anyone found spreading this rumor in the future would have inflicted upon him the Death that was Slow but Sure . " The people did n't believe a word of this but they soon ceased to bother about it ; and I assure you that to-day if they opened the vault and the coffin and found Lord Eblis himself winking at them , they would n't care . But the soldiers in the Cemetery care . " " So they took it into their own hands , " I said . " Yes , " said the Voice . " They must fetch Pannekin out very early in the morning . I ca n't be sure because do n't get here till after dark . And I do n't know what they do to him during the day , but at midnight they hunt him home as you saw . " " It 's not quite fair , " I said ; " it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " said the Voice , " hut you ca n't expect a bullet through the brain-pan to improve the logical sense , nor to be blown into small pieces to soothe the temper . They just hate the idea of Pannekin being in that vault , and surely they have a right to him one day a year . The King knows about it ; that 's why no one 's allowed out after eleven on Never Again Day . " " Your King seems an energetic monarch , " I said . " I wonder what he 'll start next . " " Naval economies , I fancy , for he 's having an affair with the third wife of the Lord High Admiral , a very highly paid and unnecessary official . " " Well , " I said , " if no one is allowed out after eleven , how are you here ? " " Oh , His Majesty could n't stop me , " said the Voice . " Why not , and who are you and why may n't I look round ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look because I 'm rather vain of my appearance , and as the result of foolishly looking a machine gun in the face I lost mine . I 'm gallant Corporal Humpit of the 4th Musketeers , allowed out once a year to watch my former comrades hunt traitor Pannekin home . Shall I have the pleasure of meeting you here next year ? " " Not if I can help it . " " Good-by , then , " And the shadow was pulled back , tickled my toes , ran up my legs , and disappeared . Now , should such a land be encouraged ? Where they tell such tales as that . But you wo n't believe I heard it , and you wo n't believe I saw Pannekin nip round the edge of that great square pursued by that dishevelled pack . Nor that I heard the huge tolling of St. Nero 's ; nor that I heard that Voice and that its shadow tickled my toes . And you 'd like to say I dreamed it all . " How did you get there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away ? And what 's the name of that land and why ca n't we find it on our maps ? " I know no more than you do . A BRIBE TO SAINT ANTONY OF PADUA ( Who aids in the recovery of all lost thing ) BY MARGARET EMERSON BAILEY S AI NT ANTONY , Does it not try the patience of a saint To hear complaint Of what is lost Not like the white palmettoes and curled fronds of frost But somewhere to be found In filth , lint , litter , on the ground ? Saint Antony , this is no idle rhyme ; I could employ your time Without your giving back One jewel from a crack . I offer in exchange The freest range In searching high , not low , for what I 've lost . Though it were folly to recount the cost , Seek my lost love and set your sandal on a kill Where on midsummer nights the leaves distil Slow drops of dew . Saint Antony , it is my courtesy to you To lead you there And id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back no meteor 's reply . Be fowler to high winds and net me one lost thought A penny might have bought ; Or if you long far space Too high to chart or trace Seek through eternity until you find My peace of mind . Saint Antony , I ask no brooch or ring , No thing But what adds luster to a saint to bring . Then promise me you 'll not forswear This search of what has vanished in thin air .
