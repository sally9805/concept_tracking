Mx business has a subsidiary in San Francisco , and it is necessary to go out several times a year , so I fly . Why ? In the first place , I may have a prejudiced-in-favor ear because I was once an active pilot ; but it is from the depths of banking business that I now cock my eye , so it is a fishy and hard-boiled eye . The ear has kept abreast of the remarkable progress in air transport , but the eye is from Missouri , and , to some extent , knows what hazards to look for . On top of this standoff are the following three reasons : Speed . I leave New York soon after nine o'clock on Monday morning and am in Oakland at two o'clock on Tuesday afternoon . By train , I should get there on Friday morning . Thrift . The round-trip air fare is $288 , and all meals are on the airway company . By train it costs $317 , including lower berth and the twenty-two meals in the dining car . Enjoyment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state after state , range after range , river after river , is unforgettable ? a gift of pride and wonder and delight . American enterprise has given to the United States the distinction of possessing , in this coast-to-coast route , the longest lighted airway in the world , 2700 miles , with nine hundred air lighthouses , chaining together Newark , Cleveland , Chicago , Cheyenne , Salt Lake City , Reno , and Oakland . It was not made to order from blueprints . Itsevolution paid the price of all our earlier speed crusades , the Pony Express , the Overland Stage , the railroads ; it cost the sweat of pioneers , the lives of many of them . I plank down my money on a commonplace counter ? a random business man and in the usual hurry ? and ask for Oakland , round trip . ' And what do I get in return ? What does it take to transport me high over the Alleghenies , across the great farms of the Plains States , over the high plateau ending in Cheyenne , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , past the desert , up across the last snowy ridge of the High Sierras ? Investigation shows that this is exactly what it takes : 12 transport pilots in six relays ; 500 mechanics , dispatchers , inspectors , and so forth ; 126 teletype station keepers ; 35 observers at weather call stations ; 16 airports ; 77 intermediate fields ; 111 lighted emergency fields ; 73 weather stations ; 232 twenty-four-inch searchlights ; 529 beacon lights . Suppose we make the trip and see for ourselves the why and wherefore of this formidable list . I The bus drives up before the terminal , to find the tri-motor already waiting on the concrete ramp . The whole outfit has been minutely inspected and passed by the ground staff . deleted material boy grins ; we walk along the covered gangway and pass a man at the door of the ship ; he smiles . At the forward end of the cabin the co-pilot is standing , facing aft . He sm ? Well ! We snuggle back into our chairs , nine of us , ignorant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-thousand-mile network of men standing by for our take-off . Fasten your safety belts , please , until the ship is in the air . ' That is in case we hit a bad bump while running fast along the ground . The manager eyes his wrist watch . For about a minute there is a lull . The ship vibrates gently from the idling engines . Time ! ' The door is slammed . And , in passing , if you ever hear of anyone jumping or falling out of a transport airplane , put no more stock in it than you would in an oyster mine in Death Valley . It would give two strong men a workout even to crack the door open six inches against that 120-miles-perhour slip stream from the propellers . The ship moves off the concrete apron , down to the end of the runway . Before he turns into the wind for the take-off , the pilot holds the machine on the brakes and guns each engine wide open for a test . We listen to the whinnying of thirteen hundred horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the runway stands a man with a big flag . When all is clear he waves it . We 're on our way ! Even as daylight shows under the big tires , the teletype in the terminal building is chattering again . Every station from Newark to Cleveland is told that we have taken off , is warned to stand by and report us , field by field , as we roar overhead . Everything is prearranged , everything clicks . We must look a brave sight as we swing up , all clean and shining white metal , over the airport boundaries , headed for the blue Pacific . But that message on the tape makes short work of us . PX 96 SMITH CV D9.25 NB ( Position Report . Airplane No. 96 . Pilot Smith . Destination Cleveland . Departed 9.25 A.M. Signed : Newark ) II We gain height . In a few minutes the engines are throttled down to cruising speed ; we level off . We seem to be suspended in space while the country rolls slowly by far below . A toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big wing stretches out utterly motionless over hill and valley shrunk to the dimensions of a Lilliput . For a moment we are as gods , complacently surveying our world from a more splendid chariot than ever Ph0- thon drove . Then the co-pilot comae along the alleyway . Methodically he takes the tickets , compares the baggage checks , and finally to each of the gods he gives a piece of chewing gum and a little cotton wool . The gum is useful in very bumpy weather , but that is not often encountered except in thundery conditions . Air sickness is rare . Flying one steaming afternoon last summer across Ohio , under low broken clouds , I had the bumpiest flight I have ever experienced , but I noticed that out of eleven passengers only one was sick . The cabin is heated ; our overcoats are folded in the racks above . We have little hickeys beside our seats to regulate the amount of air admitted through a slot in each window . The co-pilot retires to the cockpit , leaving the door open , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument panel before them , the dual controls , the telephone headsets deleted material close overhead . The pilot drops down to three thousand to keep well below them . The call of the Cleveland beacon is interrupted while the weather men there give our pilot the exact ceiling over the airport , the visibility , the wind on the field , and various other items essential to the peace of mind of a transport pilot . We lose height steadily . We run past the last few beacons and see the thousand-odd acres of the Linndale Airport . The dispatcher in the watchtower flashes our arrival to Newark and to Chicago . So far , in four hours , we have been reported twelve times by ground stations , eleven times by the pilots . The pilots lean out of their windows and watch us disembark . Our last impression of them is a friendly smile . To us it is all very novel ; to them it is just trip ump hundred and something ... . III All aboard for Chicago ! ' Twenty minutes later , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our same shining Ford , after inspection and a **29;529;TOOLONG drink from the gasoline hoses , is being taxied back along the concrete apron . Two new pilots are aboard . It is raining slightly , the ceiling about twenty-five hundred . Again that signifies little ; again the vital question is : What is it like ahead ? Eight stations on the way to Chicago have just teletyped in their weather , and the pilot 's clearance shows fair ceilings all the way . We are due to run right through a ' Low ' ( area of low pressure ) , but it is clearing the other side of Chicago . If there is any change , if thick weather comes in across the airway from Indianapolis , we know that we shall be warned . The passengers troop out , a little gloomily . Eyeing the leaden sky pressing dismally down , as bad to the west as anywhere else , they are apt to distrust the co-pilot 's assurance that it is improving ahead . Linndale sinks away . We level off at two thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air as we dash through a mild rainstorm . We look straight along the jagged underside of the cloud blanket . In the sad light we reel off mile after mile of great fields . There are no spectacular bits , only the sheer impressiveness of millions of acres of farms ? unbroken masses of fertility . The towns are like raisins in a charity plum duff . Then the airway weather men are vindicated . Over the smoke of Gary and East Chicago we see a brilliant shaft pouring slantwise through the cloud curtain . It makes a huge ellipse of hazy yellow on ten miles or so of the damp earth . As we make our left-hand circle over the Chicago Airport , the whole west is dazzlingly bright ; it is good to know that we are on our way to cloudless skies and open prairies . When the guns are cut for the landing , and our arrival is flashed to Cleveland , New York , Omaha , and Cheyenne , we have been reported forty-one times and have used up twenty-eight of our airports ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The journey , so far , has covered seven hours , as against twenty hours in the fastest limited . IV Chicago is the aircraft depot where ships are changed . The airplane which brought us from Newark will have men working on it nearly all night . When a ship rolls in from a trip , it deleted material The newest career in the world , I suppose , is this business of being a sky-girl . The stewardesses spend their lives flying at two miles a minute in the big transports . Yet , oddly , some of the girls in this division have not seen the country over which they fly in months ; it is all night flying . They are exceptional and attractive people , as you might expect ? the cream of a huge waiting list . All are graduate nurses from big hospitals , bright and devoted to their work ; and last , but not least , very smart and restful to the eye . They are in charge of the passengers throughout the flight , and their job is to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work cut out for them , for a good many mothers with babies travel in the big ships . The idea in employing graduate nurses was less to secure medical skill than to obtain disciplined and competent women , but occasions have arisen when their training has proved of value . A stewardess , for instance , was recently called upon to cope with a case of acute appendicitis ; and the imperativeness of first-class radio equipment , so that the landing field ahead could be advised immediately , was once more demonstrated . Five minutes before time , the mail and baggage are loaded aboard . An employee brings boxes of food , dinner and breakfast for all of us . The stewardess checks it over , besides the blankets and pillows and the ship 's papers , which are in her charge . We get aboard . The ship seems very spacious ; the roof is about seven feet high . There is a kitchenette , a washroom with hot and cold water , an individual light beside each chair . The stewardess offers us magazines . We settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes very calm . The setting sun makes the ground haze glow so that the land ahead is invisible . We appear to fly into a great canopy of gold . The flames from the engine exhausts show up . Another hour and night closes around us . Now begins the most interesting phase of all . Along the aisle , around the baggage and mail compartments , up two steps , is the pilot 's compartment , dark except for the dim glow of the mass of instrument dials . The pilots have a clear view through their semicircle of glass windows . The lights from the farms and the little towns sparkle like diamonds . Automobiles show up as twin pin points dotted along invisible roads . Again there is the illusion that we are motionless . Through the invisible disk of the centre propeller the lights approach slowly ; others take their place . We seem cut off from the world , and for a moment there is an impression of utter solitude . Then , dead ahead , there is a brilliant flash . It is repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course . Far beyond , we can see another and another ; sometimes as many as five are in sight at one time , part of an unbroken chain leading us westward , across the lonely prairies and over the towering Rockies . Following each white flash there is a rapid dot-dash signal in red giving the number of the beacon , so that the pilots may know their exact position . At the base of each of these latticed steel lighthouses is a brightly illuminated slab with its number painted on and an arrow pointing along the airway. - At every third beacon we find a green light added to the white and red , ? an emergency landing field , ? and as we draw up to the beacon we see the deleted material composed of two interlocking signals , about seven miles wide , directed straight along the airway , like the beam of a lantern . The centre of the beam is in the form of a constant succession of very long dashes : ? On either side of this main beam are , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dots . Viewed as a whole , then , the range beacon is sending out : So long as our pilot keeps on his course , in the very middle of the beam , he hears nothing in his earpieces but the steady stream of long dashes , calling him to the beacon . Let us suppose , however , that a strong northerly wind comes up , blowing across the course ; he will be pointing on the proper compass reading , but the wind will be pushing him sideways off the airway . Now , as soon as he drifts over too far to the left , he runs into the attendant beamlet of dots . The long dashes break up into this : ? ? That forms the letter a in Morse . The signal tells him that he is running off the course to the south , and all he has to do is rudder back in until the dot fades out and he gets the uninterrupted dashee once again . If he overdoes it and swings over to the right , once again the dashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter n , and he knows that he is too far north , so back he comes again . Through this simple yet wonderful invention , the pilot can find his way blindfold . Frequently he does , when flying the mail in heavy weather . Hemay miss seeing half a dozen beacons in a row , but as he passes over each one he gets its sotto voce signal as a subtheme to the steady beat of the big range beacon he is making for . So we make our extraordinary way . The main lighthouse ahead sends its invisible rays to guide us ; the marker beacons give us their signals , light for us to see , radio for us to hear . The caretakers pass us along the teletype circuit just as a train is passed to successive blocks ; the radio telephone keeps tabs on us from minute to minute . We are not going to get lost . VI The man in the watchtower at Omaha is waiting for us . As soon as he hears our engines , the great flood lights snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant silver . A big illuminated arrow shows the direction of the wind ; the runway is outlined in colored lights , and so are all the buildings . We sink into all this light , rumble along the concrete , pull up inside the hangar . Eight of the passengers stay in their seats , with only a yawn to show that they are alive . Two of us get out and stand around , blinking , feeling the cold after the heated cabin . The stewardess remains , but we change pilots here . To-night we happen to strike the granddaddy of them all , Ham Lee , who flies the Omaha-Cheyenne stretch . He has flown more miles than any other pilot in the world ? first in the Army , then the Air Mail service , and now with United ; he has been piloting continuously for sixteen years and has covered over a million miles . The transport pilots on a great airway are not quite what the uninitiated might expect . They are not young sprigs who put ads in the papers : ' Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are married men with children . It is not to be inferred that they are retiring elderly gentlemen with pontifical miens . These men are pretty tough hombres in their profession , superb pilots , saturated with experience bought in a bitter school , for bitter it was in the old days ; but ? they know too much to take chances . Here is the record of the first ten , all of whom are still flying a full schedule . The average for all the pilots on the airway is four thousand hours . Back in the early war days , any pilot with one thousand hours was internationally known for it . Now , he would have a poor chance of rating a co-pilot 's job on any big line . Each man has to hold the highest-class Department of Commerce license , of course , and a Federal license as radio operator . All are put through a searching examination every month by the Company 's physicians . Their job is getting more complicated every day , as technical strides are made , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flier . There are one hundred and fifty transport pilots on this airway , and some of them have made aviation history . Unostentatious and mild-mannered , they nevertheless include some of the hardest white men there are , outside the Marines . They are the front-rank pioneers of our day , out on the frontiers of what has been a very dangerous game ? the type of men the pioneers who opened up the West would have understood perfectly . They have filled up their record with the achievements of courage and sober judgment which mark the real trail breaker , and they seem to me a group of men to whom America may well point with pride . VII Off again . The tape says that it is raining around Lincoln , clear at North Platte . Our chairs are adjustable ; the backs let down so that we can recline . The stewardess comes along with pillows and blankets , tips the seats back , props our heads , tucks us in with the blankets . The farm lights become very few and far between , the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain stops about an hour out of Omaha , the clouds scatter , and once more we have ' Unlimited ' as the stars appear . The cabin is weird . Ahead of me are nine shapeless bundles , stretched out immovable on both sides of the aisle . The white blurs of the pillows show where the heads must be . The whole cabin is filled with a vague , trembling blue light from the long blue flames of the outboard exhausts . Headlong speed , but no sign of life among the strange shadows , not a vestige of a ripple in the still night air . I peer up and down the inanimate line , look sharply over my shoulder and see the watchful stewardess . Her face is whitish-blue , her eyes give an instant 's reflection of the blue flame as she gets up to discover why one of her passengers is not asleep . Soon after midnight we swing down for a landing at North Platte , where the wide , shallow river curves around this prairie airport . We pause long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , then off again . The landing at Cheyenne is a fast business . The field is six thousand feet high . The higher the field , the thinner the air ; and the thinner the air , the less it supports the wings at low speeds . Here we change pilots and ship . The stewardess also leaves us , but another one is waiting , looking much brighter than we feel ; she leads us into the brilliantly lit restaurant for refreshments . Our next two pilots are in there , finishing their coffee . It is e A.M. Mountain Time , and we have half an hour 's wait . Cheyenne is the nerve centre of the airway . Messages by radio and teletype stream in and out in the course of controlling the traffic . Overlooking the loading apron is the superintendent 's office . Maps show every mile of the airway , and a huge board with movable parts gives the present whereabouts of every airplane , pilot , and co-pilot on the line . Clerks come in and shift the numbers as the planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Just now there are five ships in the air between Chicago and San Francisco . The night superintendent has his eye on them . He has a headpiece and transmitter beside his desk , and for my edification he talks to one pilot over Reno , another approaching Salt Lake City , another leaving Iowa City , another about to land at Omaha . The static rasps ; voices in turn mention heavy rain , clear sky , High Sierras , Rockies , the flat farm lands of Iowa ; they report in Pacific , Mountain , and Central Time , out of the black night into the brightly lit office with the light oak desks . We look down from the observation window at the upper wing of the ship waiting to take off to Salt Lake City with us . Newly washed , it shines under the loading electrics . The pilots are aboard , running the engines up ; the stewardess is busy checking blankets and pillows and thermos flasks . A Government mail truck lurks in the background . The mountain air is cold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door slams , the dispatcher looks at his watch , the machine waits for a minute or so in the spotlight , the night superintendent gazing down at it from his big window . Then , our three engines making the windowpanes of the sleeping Cheyenne houses vibrate , we are signaled ahead to all the mountain stations . As we climb over the first range and pick up the Laramie beacon , I ask the stewardess to wake me well east of Salt Lake City . I stretch out for sleep . VIII She wakes me in good time . We are passing over Knight , one of the emergency fields in the heart of the mountains . Wild scenery . It is almost black in the valleys , rose and gray on the snow of the summits . The stewardess serves coffee . The faithful lighthouses still flash away beneath us , but Salt Lake City has a welcome sound . The mountain valleys along which we have been flying close in . The Wan-ship field spots us and warns Salt Lake . We dash past the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we glide over the top step of the Rockies and stare at Salt Lake City seven thousand feet straight below the tires . Wash-up , breakfast , morning papers , a smoke and look around , a fresh weather report , two new pilots , a new stewardess , and we are off into the brown desert and mountain country . The ranges , Humboldt , Ruby , Diamond , Cortez , Stillwater , appear like vast brown waves rolling majestically toward us . Some of the beacons are in such remote parts of the desert that it is not practicable to have a caretaker . The generating engines are turned on and off automatically by astronomical clocks which allow for the different seasons . Our scenery sensibilities are getting a bit blunted . Most of the terrain is easy flying country , broad valleys separated by the ranges . The system is still working with unabated zeal . We pause at Reno , take on two more passengers , and climb away from that pleasant little sink of iniquity with its rows of neon-sign illuminated gambling houses , speak-easies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vengeance , for this is the most rapid climb of the whole trip . Ahead are the pine-covered and snow-clad slopes of the High Sierras ; the powerful ship runs with the engines thundering wide open as we labor up the great incline . We top out near Donner Gap , pass the Hump , with its mountains high on either side , and the whole foreground falls away in one sheer eleven-thousand-foot descent to the green plains of California ? from the snow to the palm trees and oranges , from winter cold to the warmth of summer . How many a weary heart labored over these wind-swept , icy Sierras , to beat exultantly at the first glimpse of that Promised Land , unveiling its warm green wealth from horizon to horizon ! For us , too , it is a thrill , as the engines are cut to little more than idling speed and we sweep down at full glide over the Mother Lode of ' 49 , on to the rich cities built with the gold of these deserted mountain sides . The long flight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , concrete roads , green fields . The white streets of the first suburbs flick by beneath the undercarriage wheels . As the tires touch the concrete runway , the traffic man , unimpressed , turns from his window and taps out our valediction . It scurries back , relayed from one block to another , right across the Continent to Newark . Number One , Coast-to-Coast Limited , now landing . On time ! '
