txt " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " denly she started , and put the paper behind her on the swing . " What is it ? " " Nothing . " " Let me see . " I took the newspaper . The usual great headlines . A new allied drive . A new transport of American troops safely arrived in France . But down at the bottom of the page was a story from a military camp . Seven war objectors at the camp had refused military service and had been sentenced to twenty-five years each in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth . Three had been sentenced to forty years . One had been sentenced to death , but the case had gone to the President for review . After a while I said : " There is no use being downcast . We had expected it . " " It means that you will have to face it alone . That is the hard part . No one will be allowed to see you in prison . No one but perhaps your parents . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see you . 20 UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN I might perhaps find work near the prison , and so be near you . " Prison . . . . How strange the garden behind the professor 's house looked of a sudden . Already remote and withdrawn . The grass was cool under the apple trees , and the shadows of the hollyhocks fell in long , black bars across the gravel path . We were married under those trees . Our two mothers were present , and a few friends . For a wedding trip we went on a long walk , from village to village across the hills . For a week .. . under a cloud . Trying to ignore the cloud , trying to push away the thought of it and give ourselves wholly to each other and to the long valleys and the woods . No use . Each day , from some hamlet , I called up my home . Was there a letter ? A summons from the military board ? On the sixth day the answer was yes . I must report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military camp . That night found us in the glen . Our old glen , re-2I " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " mote in the hills , a deep gulley barricaded against the world . Many nights I had slept in a cave , concealed high on a ledge there , loving the moist fragrance of the pinewoods above me and the monotone of the brook below . " You can stay in your cave , " said Meta as we stood below it on a boulder gray-green with ancient lichen . " You can stay there till the madness passes . I can bring you food . No one will know . " She knew she was jesting . And I knew . We might run away from the world , here in the quiet glen , but never from ourselves . The troop train left from the Milwaukee station . There were six hundred of us conscripts bound for the training camp . There was a great crowd of thousands of relatives and friends at the station . We were led through the crowd and through a high iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of us had passed through , the gates in the iron fence were closed . The crowd outside could not come through . Suddenly there was commotion and cheering . A 22 UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN girl in a white dress was climbing the ten-foot iron barricade . From my window in the coach I could sec it was Meta . She cleared the top and leaped . A policeman ran toward her . But a cry arose from the crowd : " Let her go ! She 's all right ! Let her go ! " The policeman laughed and did not bar her way . She found me at the window . We looked at each other mutely . The train was moving . " Write ! Write often , " she cried . I nodded . The train-shed was filled with the noise of the grinding wheels and the shouts of the crowd and the conscripts . Everything was confusion . I craned my head out of the window , looking kick . She was still standing there . There was a great , black smudge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence when she climbed over it . And I wrote : CAMP TAYLOR Trial by Contempt CAMP TAYLOR , Kentucky , July 26 , 1918. - We arrived at the cantonment early this morning ? two hundred draftees from the west . The thirty-six hour ride was a bedlam . Most of the men were drunk . All of them swore , sang , yelled obscenities through the windows at girls when the train halted at wayside stations , dug cinders from their eyes , shot crap , and tried to sleep curled up on the dirty straw seats of the day coach . The train was a load of confusion rolling on to a greater madness . At three cities Red Cross girl volunteers with baskets of chocolate and cigarettes boarded the coaches to distribute doles . Like tendering a cutlet to a tiger : the boys whooped , growled , pawed and scrambled , fighting for their share ; one enormous buck , drunk and amorous , pursued a frightened Red Cross beauty the length of the aisle ; she fled , spilling tinsel-papered chocolates 27 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Queer . When the boys got on the train they were quiet , decent enough . The war has got into their veins already . They feel that war is a man 's game , calling for masculinity , and masculinity , as they comprehend it , calls for swagger , swearing , whisky and incessant talk of sex couched in bald and vigorous terms . . . . And one little fellow , an Italian , sat huddled in a corner , white-faced and scared , incongruous as a sheep in a bullpen . " I guess , " he confided to me , " maybe they send me back . I am so small , mister . " At two o'clock in the morning , under a full moon , the train stopped , and we were herded out of the coaches by a fussy non-corn . We paraded raggedly down a cinder road , lugging our bags and suitcases ; the little Italian scuttled at my side , a lost and lonely child . We soon came to the cantonment , vast acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parley between the non-corn and the sentry we were admitted to the rectangular pattern of the army camp . We must become part of it ; part of its rigidity and hardness . The crash of the gate behind 28 CAMP TAYLOR us was like the clang of a trap biting into one 's vitals . The hardy bucks who had swaggered on the train were quiet and abashed ; poor , grimy devils looking at each other silently , with the whisky-courage seeped out of their marrows . " Madre mia , " sighed the little Italian , shivering in the chill snap of the air . But the non-corn had come into his own ; on the train his authority had been flouted , but here his three stripes inherited new power . His commands came briskly , confidently . The two hundred followed , stifling their curses . Our shoes scuffed gravel on the silent streets ; a sentry challenged , and we passed on . There were many stops ; the army was sleepless , some of it , and in lighted barracks we were examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign , questions to answer , and it was five in the morning before we were led to our destination , a barracks in the depot brigade development battalion . We bowed under our luggage , exhausted . At 5:45 reveille sounded , and the two hundred were prodded out of their cots . Splashing in the latrine , with no officers near , they let loose their first 29 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " impressions of the army in a stream of curses . " Forty-five minutes ' sleep in two days ; by cripes , I 'd like to smash that pasty-faced pouter pigeon of a non-corn , " cried the big buck who had chased the nurse down the train aisle . " You 're in the army now , " sang a malicious red-head . He was drowned by an uproar . Breakfast . . . soppy porridge , milk , corn pone and syrup all dumped together on a pieplate . . . regulation mess-kits ran out , the mess sergeant explained . . . . Then , still in civilian togs , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At galloping speed we were herded through a series of barracks ; weighed , prodded , punched , tested . . . a thousand stark naked men , rushed like beef-cattle through a packing house , to be barked at and bullied by a battalion of harassed medics , sweating in the sultry barracks that smelled of disinfectants and flesh . I saw now and then my little Italian friend , pale under the indignity of prodding hands , and his eyes caught mine in mute and helpless appeal . . . . Then dress again , and march back , and dinner of beef , potatoes , sweet corn and chocolate pudding all dumped again in a 30 CAMP TAYLOR soggy mass on a pieplate . . . and back to the med ical barracks to be run again through the line of white hands . . . . And then supper , and barracks , and cots and sleep . . . while the rookies swore in the dark after " lights out , " and the little Italian closed his black Bible and slipped it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to mine . " And the doctor he say I am all right , " he said sadly . " So the army keep me , such a small fel low . " . . . A dark form behind a flashlight popped into the barracks door . " Quiet , men ! " he roared . July 27. - This morning , after mess , we were lined up in the company street and after roll call army uniforms were issued . " You will each of you try on a uniform and if it does n't fit , swap around with your buddies till you get a good fit , " the corporal commanded . The forty-six rookies in my barracks stripped and began pulling on breeches , shirts , put-tees and shoes . My outfit , neatly folded , lay on my cot . I sat on the cot quietly , though I was conscious of the blood pumping in my veins. 31 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " The corporal came briskly toward me . " Snap into it , buddy , " he barked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My throat felt constricted , dry . I rose , steeling myself with effort . " I am not going to put on that uniform , " I said . The corporal looked at me without comprehension . " You put on that uniform , see , " he repeated mechanically , " and if it does n't fit , why , you can swap around and ? " " I refuse to put on that uniform , " I said , a little louder . This time he understood . He stood there , dazed . The rookies around us had heard the dialogue . They closed in on us in a disheveled , curious knot , with their shirts half on , their breeches trailing . Then the corporal came to life . " Stand back , men , " he bawled . " We 'll take care of this son of a bitch ! " He shoved his way through the crowded barracks , and ran toward the door . 32 CAMP TAYLOR " Sergeant Harkenrider ! " he yelled . " Sergeant Harkenrider . " His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a murmuring knot . The corporal came bouncing into the barracks again with the sergeant at his heels . Top Sergeant Harkenrider was stocky , deep-chested , with closeshorn hair bleached by the sun to the color of new corn-silk . His light blue eyes seemed strangely washed-out in his swarthy face , tanned like a russet boot . He was an old army man . His uniform had been scrubbed and washed to an uneven lemon and white ; his new brown puttees seemed alien bark grafted on a gray poplar . The rookies had finished pulling on their clothes . They made way for the sergeant and the corporal , then closed around us , silently , standing on cots and peering over each other 's shoulders . The sergeant planted himself squarely in front of me , with clenched fists half-raised . " The corporal reports that you refuse to put on the uniform . " 33 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " " I do . " " I order you , private , to put on that uniform ! " " I refuse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath and expelled it in a gust of profanity . His fists swung menacingly . His face almost touched mine . I did not move . I waited for the blow . I had been prepared for this ? torture , court-martial , a life in prison , and some of us had died . What of it ? Everybody was dying , everywhere . Better to go under of one 's own choice , with one 's head up , than be dragged away against one 's reason and conscience to slaughter and be slaughtered in a fantastic and meaningless war . The constriction had left my throat , the faces of the ring of rookies no longer swam as in a haze . They were waiting for the climax ; bending forward avidly for the knockout . But the blow never fell . The sergeant 's curses exploded in a final : " Now , you god damn yellowback , will you put on that uniform ? " " I will not , " I said . The sergeant 's china-blue eyes were sharp , bright pin-points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll see , you son of a bitch ! Follow me . " He turned on his heel , shoving aside the rookies . I followed , with the corporal at my heels . At the barracks door , the sergeant turned . " Corporal , have the men turn out . And order the men in the other barracks to assemble in the company street . Remember , corporal , what we did to the last white-livered slacker . " " Yes , sir . " The rookies followed us out of the barracks door . The privates of the Twenty-second Company , Sixth Training Battalion , poured from the line of adjoining barracks . I was taken to the center of the dusty road between the buildings . It was zr o'clock in the morning and stifling hot . The dust , kicked up by the sultry breeze , blew over the roofs in little gray whirlwinds . The two hundred rookies in their new uniforms crowded the porches , and closed in around the sergeant , the corporal and me in a dense mass . The buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men , " he cried , " I am sorry to announce that we have a traitor among us . This fellow here , who came 35 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " to camp with you , who was accepted by you as one of your own kind , has turned out to be a yellow dog . He refuses to fight in the defense of his country . What 'll we do to him , men ? " There was a moment of silence , then a confused shout . " Lynch the bastard ! " " Shoot him ! " " Let us take care of him , sergeant . " The crowd milled excitedly , and more uniformed men came running down the narrow street between the barracks . Clinging to the railing on one of the porches was the little Italian , looking at me , bewildered and understanding nothing . The outcry grew to an uproar , which died away again when the sergeant once more lifted his hand . " Corporal , " he said , " will you tell these loyal boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture , " what we did to the last yellowback in the training battalion ? that fellow who thought he was Jesus Christ Himself ? " " Yes , sir , " said the corporal . " We provided the men with paddles and clubs , and we ran that slacker around the barracks and every man took a swing at him till he dropped . " 36 CAMP TAYLOR Again the uproar , wilder , more shrill . Again the sergeant ordered silence . " One more chance , " he said , turning toward me . " One more chance . Now will you put on the uni-form ? " " I will not . " The clamor broke once more . The rookies closed in in a tighter knot , their reddened , angry faces dust-streaked where the sweat ran . . . . The narrow street is baking hot with bodies close-pressed against each other , and the sun angry in the noon sky . The sun standing still . Everything standing still , waiting again for the climax . Why did n't they end it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or give a man a fighting chance here in this dusty alley between the barracks . The sergeant still looks at me , waiting for a quaver , and the shouting continues , led by a big buck on the porch railing , who yells : " The paddles , sergeant ; break out the paddles ! " And then , although the sergeant has given no signal , the shouting subsides . An orderly pushes his way through the jammed street , and behind him a man in captain 's uniform . . . . So the game will go on . X37 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " The sergeant and the corporal snapped to attention . The rookies straightened up , fumbling awkward salutes . " What is wrong here , sergeant ? " snapped the captain . He was young , wiry , polished , with steady , clever eyes and an even voice . " We 've found a slacker , sir , who refuses to put on the uniform . " The captain stepped up to me . " Mennonite ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . You have no whiskers . Quaker ? " " No , sir . I belong to no church . " " Ah , " said the captain coldly . " A new breed . " He turned to the sergeant . " Sergeant , have this fellow brought to headquarters immediately . And clear the street . " The rookies straggled back into the barracks . I followed the orderly down the stifling street , rubbing the caked dust from my face . The captain 's quarters were at the front end of one of the barracks that had been dignified by fresh 38 CAMP TAYLOR paint . A couple of lieutenants idling in the anteroom leaped smartly to attention when he crossed the threshold , and eyed me with cold curiosity . My blue serge civilian suit , now that the rookies had been accoutered , was as conspicuous as a tuxedo in a penitentiary chain gang . The captain entered his office and sat down . It was intolerably hot . An electric fan rustled a stack of papers on the desk . The documents looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acres of barracks and savage as sabers . The captain looked at me across the fluttering papers . " You know what you are in for ? " " I know . " " If I ca n't touch your patriotism , perhaps I can appeal to your intelligence . I have had one so-called conscientious objector in my company . Ignorant lout . He ca n't see consequences . He lacks imagination . But you , surely , ought to foresee the results of your stubbornness . Disgrace . Court martial . Possibly a life-time in prison ? I understand that a number have been sentenced to be shot . And even if you should cor is out again , with a whole skin , you 39 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " know what awaits you ? Social disgrace and ostracism . . . could you face that ? " " I could , captain . " He looked at me contemptuously . " I see . Like to pose as a martyr ! " " No , captain . The draftees are the martyrs . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futilely . I pity them . I do n't pity myself at all . I , at least , am saving something out of the war which may be sacrificed by a good many conscripts . . . my self-respect . " The captain reddened . His voice , which had been even , rose angrily . " And you expect the rest of us to march to the battlefields and save this country from invasion so that you can stay here and nurse your precious self-respect ? " " I am not convinced that there is the slightest danger of invasion . " " I see , " said the captain bitingly , " you disagree with the greatest minds in the country . I honestly ca n't understand your attitude . You are a pacifist ? " " Yes . Though not an absolutist . " CAMP TAYLOR " But you are against wars ? " " Yes . " " And so am I , " cried the captain . " I hate war as much as you do . I have a home in the west and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to enter the officers ' training school . I did it because I hate war . And this war will end all wars ; there will never be another . We are crushing forever the spirit of militarism in the world . And if you really hate war , as you profess , I ca n't see how you can stand by and not give this war your support . Our president is no military man . We are really a nation of pacifists and this is a crusade . " " As bloody and meaningless as the rest of the crusades . Though I wish I were as convinced of the holiness of the war as you , captain . It would make things simpler . I ca n't believe that the allies have come into this with clean hands , or that a new era of international peace and justice will follow our victory . I grant that at present the Prussians represent the climax of the militaristic idea , but only because they have pursued it with more efficiency than their neighbors , and not because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs . I believe that if Germany is crushed , there will be new alignments , and a new nation or a new alliance will ascend to military power , as in the past Rome , Spain , and England were in the saddle . I think war as an instrument has been discredited again and again , and I ca n't bring myself to commit murder in its name . " The captain listened impatiently , drumming his fingertips . " And you dismiss such things as love of country and patriotism ? " " I love my country , but there is a patriotism that extends beyond national boundaries . I can feel no hatred for another nation or race merely because a group of war-makers sign an official paper . " " And I suppose you think your gesture will save the world ? " " No , captain , any more than all the cannons and armies will . But a couple of million of us might . You ca n't fight wars if the people fold their arms . Some day brothers will learn the sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be futile , but not to me. " 42 CAMP TAYLOR The captain arose and walked to the window , looking out at the baking street where a sentry kicked up the dust in fine gray clouds . He had been patient with me . He might , perhaps , have needed to sign only one of those merciless papers on the desk to send me packing to the guardhouse . The documents , rustling under the electric fan , were weighted down by a glittering , military belt buckle . The captain turned again . " I do n't know why I should feel sorry for you , but I do , " he said . " Perhaps because when I went to college I used to have radical notions myself once in a while . I want to ask you one more question . Will you put on the uniform and take noncombatant service ? You might be placed in the base hospital here in Camp Taylor . We have a number of Quakers there now . You will not be called to the front . Come , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " Because I object to the whole game of war , and not the mere business of shooting guns . There is no essential difference between being a soldier and 43 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " patching up other men in hospitals to go out and continue the slaughter . " " Ah , " said the captain maliciously , " your selfrespect again . Will your self-respect allow you to work in the kitchen till your case is disposed of ? " " It will . From the time I entered this camp I considered myself , in effect , sentenced to the penitentiary . I expect to go to prison . I expect to work there . I may as well begin my sentence now . " " But feeding recruits ? is n't that aiding war ? " " To be consistent , I should commit suicide . I suppose in wartime almost all of our actions aid war in some measure . There 's a tax on cigarettes , which aids war , but I have n't quit smoking . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . I 've drawn the line . I 'm ready to work if only to keep from going mad . I have no desire to go mad . " " You 're a bit that way already , " said the captain with almost a smile . Then he straightened . His military precision , which had dropped from him during the examination , returned . " Lieutenant Roberts ! " he called . The lieutenant appeared . X44 CAMP TAYLOR " Take this man to the mess hall and turn him over to the mess sergeant , " the captain ordered . " Inform him that he has refused military duty and will do K.P . until further orders . And instruct Sergeant Harkenrider that all men in the barracks are to leave him strictly alone . If anybody speaks with him , or if he is caught in the act of speaking to any private in the company , I am to be informed immediately . " " Yes , sir . " The captain sat down before his rustling papers . I followed the lieutenant out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot road between the barracks . It was now nearly noon . It was 98 degrees in the shade , and , possibly , 112 in the sunlight . And in that glare I caught a glance of a strange drama . A bearded Mennonite youth , member of a Christian sect whose central faith is nonresistance , was standing against a barracks wall . The back of his bare head and his heels touched the hot planks . He had been ordered to stand so . He 45 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " had refused a soldier 's uniform . A guard , watching him , stood in the narrow strip of shadow on the opposite side of the road . The sun beat down on the bearded face of the Mennonite . His blue eyes were bloodshot from the glare . His tight , black suit , fastened oddly with metal hooks instead of buttons , was covered with a layer of dust . His cheeks and forehead , where sweat had dripped , were streaked , showing red , scorched skin in the furrows under the grime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant and I passed , close to him , he looked at us with expressionless eyes , and his head strained forward a little . Instantly the guard took a step toward him . " Up with that head ! " The head went back again till it touched the hot plank ... . The lieutenant and I reached the mess-hall . Two rows of long , narrow , unpainted tables , scrubbed white , were laden with water pitchers and heaps of white bread , ready for the noon meal . In the back of the hall , three cooks in aprons , white pants , and dripping wet undershirts , were working between two ranges going full blast . A half dozen K.P . ' s , chores over for a moment , were killing flies with 46 CAMP TAYLOR swatters . The mess sergeant came forward toward the lieutenant . He was a little , brisk fellow . The lieutenant repeated the captain 's instructions . " And you will see to it , sergeant , " he added , " that lie gets plenty of work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised the sergeant , looking at me hardly . " Follow me . " He took me back to the head cook . " We 've got one of those god damn yellowbacks here , " said the sergeant . " Captain 's orders are to work him hard . " " Sure thing . I 'll give him every dirty pot in the place . " The cook tried to look fierce , but he did n't succeed . He was moon-faced , jovial , with no more malice in him than a mustard seed . " You 'll find an extra pair of overalls behind the door there . And keep off your shirt . You wo n't need it . And hey , you at the sink there , " he added , calling to a rookie who was sweating over a pile of pots , " you can drop that and chase flies . We got a new slave for the job . " The rookie wiped his hands dry , gratefully . I changed my clothes and took my post at the big 47 " HEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . The hot stove was two feet behind my back . In five minutes I was drenched with sweat from head to foot . The big cooking boilers with copper bottoms must be scoured till they shone , the cook ordered , and if any dirt was found clogged around the rim on the bottom of the boiler my head would come off . I scraped , dug , scratched , polished . It was not new work for me . I had washed dishes for half a year in a Seattle waterfront beanery and had cooked and washed dishes through a lean year at college . The pots shone . Meanwhile the rookies had come in from morning drill , and filed into the mess hall . The K.P . ' s lined up at the counter , dishing out grub into mess-kits and pieplates . There was clatter , banging of metal cups . And more dishes , pitchers , pots for the sink . The perspiration ran down my face . I whistled . One must keep up a front , even with one 's hands covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails . The cook came over to inspect . He ran his finger around the copper bottom of a boiler and grunted approvingly . 48 CAMP TAYLOR " Good enough , " he said . You must ' a put some elbow grease on this old pot , buddy . Say , what got into you anyhow to act like this ? " I whistled . " You deaf ? " asked the cook , a little nettled . " You 're not supposed to talk to me , and I 'm not supposed to answer . That 's what the captain ordered , " I said . " I 'd contaminate you . " " Contaminate hell , " said the cook . " Let me tell you , buddy , I 'm not so soft on this war myself . But you 're a damn fool for cutting up this way . Shucks , we 'll never get across anyhow . The Heinies are ready now to throw down their guns . " I leaned over the sink and scooped up the last pot . " When you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you lay off for a spell , and have your chow . " I finished the pot . I had my dinner , and the cook sliced off a piece of pie that he had made especially for himself and his two assistants . He filled up a mess-kit cup with ice water , and dumped into it a half cupful of pineapple juice . " Try this , buddy . " I went out on the little back porch for a breath of 49 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " air . Three K.P . ' s were on the porch , peeling potatoes and slapping at the flies that buzzed around them . I looked at the wall of the barracks where two hours before I had seen the Mennonite boy . The figure in black was gone . The sun glared on the blank wall . " Looking for your pal , that guy with whiskers ? " asked one of the K.P . ' s with a grin at the others . " Yes . Did they take him away ? " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I was settin ' here and I seen it . " " Dead ? " " Hell , no . Just knocked out by the sun , I guess . I asked the guard . He keeled over , flat on his face , the poor bastard . But he had it coming to him . " " You damn right he had it coming to him , " nodded another K.P . whom I dimly remembered having seen in the crowd that surrounded me in the morning . " I ai n't got no use for the lousy yellowback . And you 'll get yours next , baldy , if you do n't act sensible . " The heat-waves shimmered in zigzags over the company street , and danced over the roofs of the 5o CAMP TAYLOR endless acres and acres of barracks . I felt the barracks as a solid wall , with the world beyond them beautiful , and unreal and unattainable . This was the grim , mad world . This was Camp Taylor , Kentucky . And they had tried to break the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the inviolability of the Word . In the loose dust , at the side of the barracks , were two deep footprints , but the boy in the black suit was gone . July 31. - For four days I have been scouring pots , scrubbing tables , peeling potatoes , mopping floors and hauling coal in the mess-hall . The hours are from 5:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. The mess-sergeant , with lovely malice , has assigned me the job of carrying meals to our company 's prisoners in the guardhouse . They have been jailed for A.W.O.L. and other minor offenses . I load up a great trayful of food , and walk down the hill to the stockade . The sergeant in charge carefully examines the dishes for concealed files , or forbidden cigarettes and dainties . I wait in the outer room , separated from the big one-51 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " roomed cell by heavy bars . The prisoners crowd at the door hungrily , cursing the food and me . " Hey , you god damn slacker , we 'll have you behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , Butch , " says another , " and , boy , will we make him like it ! . . . " " Pipe down , " orders the sergeant , " we 'll take care of him , do n't you birds worry . . . . " I climb up the hill again , with the empty plates . Fourteen hours a day in the kitchen , hot as a furnace . At night I return to the barracks to sleep with the uniformed rookies . The officers have tried to build a wall around me , break me by ostracism . My letters from home are withheld ; none has reached me . Three nights ago the corporal in our barracks called the rookies to attention . " Men , " he said , " this fellow has proved himself a coward and a traitor . Make him feel his lowness . Shun him like you would a snake . " The rookies looked at me with hostility . I sat on my cot , whistling . You ca n't get your boilers steamed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wall around me has already crumbled . It is the corporal , a chesty , snippish young fellow proud of his chevrons , whJ is 52 CAMP TAYLOR now disliked . The rookies defy the captain 's orders and whisper to me . They mail my letters secretly at the Y.M.C.A. hut , so they 'll escape the censor . They bring me things from the canteen . I am confined to barracks , and must not cross the company street . But the rookies bring me ice-cream cones , gum , chocolate and stamps . " Here you are , buddy , " they whisper , handing me things in the dark after lights out . " Do n't let the sons o ' bitches buffalo you , kid . I wish I had your guts . Well , they got me this time , but you wait till they come around again ... " The rookies hate the corporal with his strutting and swagger . They hate the army . They hate drilling in the infernal heat on a dusty parade ground , with a drill sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . They hate being dragged out of barracks after supper time to sing in the company street . What singing ! The corporal bullies and blusters and exhorts . " Come on , men , put some pep into this . All together now , fellows : " There 's a Long , Long Trail A-Winding . . . " The rookies open their throats and achieve pathetic disharmonies . I sit on my cot in the barracks , hearing 53 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " them through the open window . There is no heart in their soldier songs , no conviction , no recklessness . They are tired children , angry and puzzled . Why are they here ? They go to the lectures at the Y.M.C.A. hut where Christian chaplains and lieutenants tell them why they are here . They are here to make the world safe for democracy , and it 's Berlin or bust , say the chaplains and lieuts . The rookies remember the slogans ; they chant the slogans , make a new religion of them , and tuck away the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slogans like parrots , but they do not sing like warriors . " Come , men , " cries the corporal , " one more snappy song before we turn in : Over there , over there ... ' " The men wheeze a half-hearted chorus , and then tumble back into the barracks to curse the corporal and fling their wearied bodies on the cots . And yet in later years they will recall this as a grand , heroic escapade . They will forget the insults of non-coms , the prison pressure of the barracks walls , the dust and the heat , and the warm drinking water in the latrine . They will think of themselves as adventurers sharing in glorious enter-54 CAMP TAYLOR prise . . . . The little , pale Italian even . He sits on his cot , brushing the dust out of his puttees . He has his hat on at a rakish tilt as if to convince himself that he is a son of Caesar . But his eyes are as sad and resentful as a punished child 's . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rookies . We were marched through camp to a barrack where we filled out insurance papers and questionnaires . In my overalls , at the end of the line , I was conspicuous among my uniformed mates . Knots of soldiers along the route hurled questions . " Hey , buddies , who 's the guy in fatigue ? " " Yellowback ! " And a chorus took up the refrain : " Yellowback , yellowback , we 'll get you when we get back ! . . . " In the barracks , bristling with clerks , the corporal ordered me to step out of ranks . He led me to the center of the big room and announced : " Here 's a slacker . Who wants him ? " " Here ! Here ! " cried a half dozen voices . And seven of them , one after another , ran me through a verbal gamut . They bullied , threatened , cursed , buried me under their contempt . . . . And to-day the ordeal 55 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " was repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the march under the hot sun ; this time to face a line of medical assistants armed with hypodermic needles and brushes dipped in iodine . The rookies remove their shirts , place hand on hip , elevating their bare upper arms . The long needles look vicious . The rookies pale as they see the needles jabbed into their comrades ' arms . Many of them faint . In the shadow of the barracks outside lie a long line of unconscious rookies . My turn comes . " Here 's a slacker , " announces my friend the corporal . " Give him all you got , doc . " The long needle plunges into my arm , striking the bone . I smile at the corporal ; more of a grimace than a smile . He glares back at me , and I walk through the line and out of the door , whistling . This evening , after I came from the kitchen and bathed and changed my clothes , I met the top sergeant in the company street . The same top sergeant , Harkenrider , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival in camp . The sergeant stopped me . " Hello , " he said , " still standing pat ? " 56 CAMP TAYLOR " Yes . " He put his hand lightly on my shoulder . " All right , boy , " he said . I looked at him in astonishment . He was smiling . Then he turned on his heel and swung down the road . . . . From the street in front of the barrack came the voices of the men , herded together for their evening song . " The Yanks are coming , the Yanks are coming . . . " Their shadows in the long rays of the sunset bulk gigantically on the barracks walls . But they do not sing like warriors . Their voices are lost in an angry world . August i6. - Incredible contrast . Yesterday I was still surrounded in an army barrack by two-score recruits stirring the sultry air with their profanity ; to-day I have taken quarters with sixty solemn religionists , singing psalms and carrying their Bibles wherever they go . They are dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have high crowns ; their trousers have no pockets ; their cheeks are ruddy and their eyes kindly but grave , even though they are all 571 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " mere boys . They are mostly Mennonites . And this is the isolated quarters of the conscientious objectors , on the very edge of Camp Taylor . Across the road , with no fence to bar the way , wave Kentucky cornfields , yellow-ripe . Yesterday , accompanied by the corporal , I was brought to this queer place . There is a line of a dozen big tents , and , a little apart from the others , two more tents under guard , housing a dozen unfortunates whose consciences were found below specifications and who now are awaiting transfer to the disciplinary barracks at Leavenworth . The others await hearing by the President 's special board ; they are hoping to be awarded farm furloughs . Immediately on my arrival I was taken before a lieutenant . Again I was questioned . Again I was offered noncombatant work in the hospital or quartermaster 's unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of the barrack prison , and spreading my blankets on the hard earthen floor of an airy tent . The relief of escaping from the ring of uniforms , the circle of contempt which had surrounded me for three nightmare 58 CAMP TAYLOR weeks . Unpacking my duffle bag , I felt a release from darkness and pressure , as if I had crawled from a cave into sunlight . Here was sanity again . Here were friends , and a welcome . A half dozen of the boys crowded around me , questioning me gravely . What had been my treatment in the barracks ? Excellent , I said , considering that it would have been entirely appropriate and within the limits of " military necessity " to have shot me . I had been threatened , bullied , but not harmed , I told them . " You are lucky , " said one boy . " See there , " he added , lowering his head and exposing what appeared to be a big red contusion on his scalp . " What is that ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out while a couple of soldiers held me . I do n't remember what happened then . I fainted . " " They took off all my clothes except my underwear , " said another , " and first they hit me with belts till I bled and then tied me on a chair and put me under a cold shower bath . " " And the officers were aware of all this ? " I asked . 59 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " " I do n't know . I do n't think so . It was mostly the privates and there were a couple of non-coms , too , I think . But you know we 'd die first before putting on a uniform and killing a man , " he added quietly . " We are Mennonites . What church do you belong to , brother ? " " None , " I said . They looked at each other a little put out . " You do n't belong to a church ? Then why are you a conscientious objector ? " asked the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " perhaps I do n't love God as much as you do , but I hate war just as much . Wo n't you allow me a conscience even if I 'm not a church member ? " " But do n't you believe in the Word ? " asked the same boy earnestly . " I 'm afraid not , " I admitted . " But it seems to me that has very little to do with active opposition to war . There are hundreds of millions of Christians in many nations who profess to believe in the divinity and teachings of Christ and yet go to battle swinging bloody bayonets . " 6o CAMP TAYLOR " But would you ever take a life ? " persisted the youth whose hair had been torn out . " For instance , if you were held up by a burglar would you hit him or offer resistance ? " " I certainly would , " I said . " But I do n't see the application of your illustration to this war . Would n't you resist a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three voices . And I felt , maybe unjustly , that I was again surrounded by a hostile ring . Perhaps not hostile , but shocked and unsympathetic . I felt the warmth of their welcome withdrawn , and suspicion in their eyes . Suspicion of my motives , my sincerity . I was sailing under false colors , a coward and slacker , merely afraid to go to war . I could read this verdict in their faces as they turned away and left me . Feeling very desolate , I finished stowing away my belongings in a shelved soap-box that was nailed to the tent-pole . Then I walked out into the morning sunlight , and sat on a mound in front of the tent , looking at the cornfield and the red tip of a distant barn nearly hidden by the tassels . Perhaps an hour later the boy with the wounded 61 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " scalp came out of his tent and walked toward me . He held a Bible in his hand . I arose and greeted him . His blue eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " if I sit down here with you and read the Bible to you ? " " Not at all , " I answered truthfully . " I enjoy the Bible very much . Particularly Ecclesiastes , the Song of Solomon , Samuel and Matthew . " " This Bible is in German . Our group was started in Switzerland and Holland . Can you understand German ? " " Yes . Please sit down and read to me . " He sat down . " I like St. Matthew best myself , " he said . " And I ? I think it may help you . " So he sat by me and read in a sober monotone , turning over the leaves with the broad , knotty fingers of a farm boy . There was a strangeness again in the air . Yesterday men in uniform , by threats and argument , had sought to convert me to the military faith . To-day a queer , kindly soul in black coat and trousers was trying to lead me into a fold far different . 62 CAMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest , " read the Mennonite slowly . " Take my yoke upon you and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart , and ye shall find rest unto your souls . " His voice was low-pitched and intense . We were interrupted by a sudden wild chorus of yells , and the throb of an army truck . A motor-load of recruits , bound for Louisville on furlough , roared by on the road , ten feet from our knoll . The soldiers waved their hands . " Hi , whiskers ! " they yelled . My Mennonite friend looked after them without anger . He raised one hand and touched lightly the still sore wound on his scalp . Then he began reading again , quietly , and the open page of the Bible looked very white and pure in the bright sunlight . While the Mennonite read to me from the Bible the morning sun had climbed . Pulsating heat hung over camp and cornfield . The dirt road in front of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one side lay the Kentucky farm , 63 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " with sunbeams glinting on the broad , green corn leaves , and the silence there was broken by the shrilling of a locust and the faint , peaceful drone of an unseen windmill . On our side , to the dingy horizon , stretched the rectangular sides and roofs of the Camp Taylor barracks , ugly sheds housing ugliness . Soldiers briskly walking the streets added their olive drab to the brown-gray monochrome . From the distant parade ground came the impatient call of a bugle , and officers racing in motorcycle side-cars raked up dust clouds . The camp was stirring with ominous enterprise , but beyond the road the corn tassels rocked gently . A sparrow at its dust bath in the road regretted its ambition and flew to a fence post , looking at us with sleepy eyes . The Mennonite came to the end of a chapter . He stopped , closing the Bible gently . " Thank you , " I said . " I enjoyed it very much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I do n't know how I could have found strength without it . They took everything away from me in the barrack , you know , but when I begged for the 64 CAMP TAYLOR Bible they finally let me have it . I had it in my coat pocket when they pulled out my hair , and I kept my hand on it and it gave me strength . " His brown , strong hands held the Book reverently . They were the hands of a farm boy . He was a farm boy , he said , from Elkhart , Indiana , where there was quite a colony of Mennonites . I asked him about his faith . It was four hundred years old , and its followers had endured much , he said . The Mennonites sprang up in Zurich in 1523 , as a protest against the non-Christian character of the existing church . They recognize no authority outside of the Bible , and maintain the sanctity of human life and of a man 's word . They will not kill , nor will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They believe in entire separation from the world ; they live apart , pursuing holiness and fighting the lusts of the flesh in a society pledged to primitive discipline . They frown on the ornaments and embroideries of worldly life ; they prescribe the tight , black , buttonless uniforms for the men , and the long skirts and bonnets for the women . They have no heirarchy of the church , but only " exhorters " chosen by the mem-65 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " bers , and " elders " for administering the Lord 's supper and baptism . In common with the early Christians , the founders of the order believed it was their duty to disobey laws of an alien power , and they were therefore persecuted both by the Protestants and the Catholics . Their movement spread from Zurich to Holland , where Menno Simons became their leader , whose name later became the name of their sect . In Holland the Mennonites were exempt from military service , oath-taking and public office . In France they were exempt from military service in 1793 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to America first in 1683 , settling in Pennsylvania . In their communities they speak low-German . They believe that razors and buttons are unlawful . " Why is that ? " I asked . " It is not set down in the Bible that men should shave or wear buttons , " said my friend . He fingered his reddish stubble beard cautiously . " They are making us shave , " he added sadly . " To-day or to-morrow the sergeant will come into our tent and force us to shave . He did that a week ago . Now 66 CAMP TAYLOR he will notice my beard again and make me take it off . He does n't know what it means to us . He is very cruel . " I repressed a smile , conscious of real even if ridiculous tragedy . And I wondered if it was a matter of vital necessity for the United States army to shave a Mennonite 's beard in order to help the allies make the world safe for democracy . Were n't the Mennonites part of our democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers and a part of our curious national heterogony ? Why had they been brought to camp at all ? Their faith was long-rooted ; their opposition to war unshakable and historically recognized . Why had they not been sent back to their prayers and their toil by the local draft boards , instead of being dragged to camp to be bullied and tortured in army barracks for dreadful weeks before being segregated with their kind ? Their pacifism was not political heresy , not the dangerous doctrine of radicals ; they lived apart in a world of their own , followers of Christ , and they had left no visible imprint on our military civilization through the four centuries of their existence . They would always re-67 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " main the passive victims of war , and never the active enemies of the military order . " But now that you 've been removed from the barracks , you no longer are tortured ? except for the matter of shaving your beards ? " I asked my friend . " It is better here , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still in danger . We are part of the Development Battalion ? the sick and illiterate soldiers . Do you see that barrack right across from our tents ? " " Yes . " " It is full of soldiers suffering from venereal disease . And we are afraid we shall catch those diseases . " But why ? There is little danger . " " Because , " said the Mennonite , " we are compelled to use the same mess-hall that they use ? and the same latrine . " " What ! " " It is true . ' We are afraid to use the latrine , but what can we do ? We must . And every man in that barrack is diseased and hates us , and makes threats ? you understand ? " 68 CAMP TAYLOR I understood . And though I had come to learn cruelty more deadly in the army camps , I had met none more subtle and awful . It takes amazing cunning , amazing brutality to conceive a notion like this : segregating the disciples of Christ with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving banners . in a holy war . August 22. - Life among the Mennonites in their segregated camp is as circumscribed by their creed as the routine of the barracks ' soldiers is narrowed by the military manual . They are kindly , courageous , but dull . They suffer much from their persecutors , but they endure more under the rigorous discipline of their own faith . At least so it appears to me , not as well equipped with humility and meekness as are these unworldly followers of Christ . They sing , pray eternally , and the loudest and most earnest of them are the two-dozen prisoners awaiting transfer to the military penitentiary , who are under heavy guard in the group of end tents of our little colony . I hear 69 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " them in the morning ; I hear them in the afternoon and at night until taps , whipping up their spirits under the lash of religious ecstasy . Their voices go rolling over the camp : " He will take care of you , through all the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then knots of soldiers gather in front of the barrack across the way and yell back jeers : " Hi , whiskers ? let 's have Beautiful K-K-Katy ! ' " . . . We never see these hidden choristers in the tent except at mealtimes . Then they march , under guard , to the mess-hall . While the rest of us sit on the benches , they eat standing up , and , condemned to silence , they look over at us gravely , or try to beckon messages to their friends when the guards are not looking . Then they march soberly back to their tents , and sing hymns again , soberly . I can not complain of our treatment . Our distress is mostly psychological . We see these prisoners at mess each day and wonder when we , too , will be eating standing up and confined to the ominous knot of tents . We are at the mercy of unseen , implacable powers ; but so , of course , are the uniformed soldiers in camp . There is an iron force dominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual beats his head helplessly . Only the blindest loyalty ? or the basest fear ? could make these soldiers submit so slavishly to the goad . I wonder if it will ever be determined in later days whether it was fear or devotion or stupidity that made the military overlordship possible ; that made two million men , priding themselves as free-born , submit tamely to the dictatorship of the iron gauntlet . More awful than this sense of impotency is the specter of our immediate danger . Whether real or fancied , I am not versed enough in medical science to know , but real or not , the distress of our group is acute . We are still segregated with the diseased and unfit soldiers ; we are still forced to use the latrine in the barracks occupied entirely by venereals , and though we take the utmost and perhaps most ridiculous precautions to guard against infection , the knowledge of our peril weighs on us like a nightmare . Last night , in the dark , one of the Mennonites came to me in my tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it . " 71 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " " What ? Is this Joseph ? " " Yes , this is Joseph . " " What:s wrong , Joseph ? What have you got ? " He named a dreadful disease . " What makes you think so , Joseph ? " " I broke out in a rash , " he whispered . I could feel him tremble . " I 've never been sick before . I 've been afraid to tell the boys in my tent . I have n't slept for two nights . " " You may be wrong , Joseph . It may be nothing , " I assured him . " But to-morrow , just to ease your mind , you must report on sick call and see the doctor . Will you do that ? " He promised , and stole out of the tent . And this noon he came to me happily . He had been to the doctor . It was nothing serious , the doctor had said . Now he could sleep again . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had survived kindred frights . Each visit to the barrack across the street is fraught with anxiety . We choose hours when the soldiers were likely to be at mess , but there are always stragglers . " We 'll get you yet , " say the soldiers with a meaningful laugh . 72 CAMP TAYLOR The Development Battalion is the backwash of the military camp . All diseased or illiterate . Four days ago a Y.M.C.A. official came to our tents and asked for more volunteers to teach in the beginners ' English classes at the " Y " hut . A half dozen of us volunteered . Why not ? There would be a day , perhaps , when reading would help them to sanity , even though it would be employed at present in conning the patriotic handbooks of the Y.M.C.A. ? whose Christian officials never came to our c. o. camp to encourage the Mennonites in their devotion to the Christian ideals . . . . I have become a teacher , four hours each day , of a pathetic assemblage of negroes and whites suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddest and most sodden lot of humans that could be collected under one roof . There are illiterate " crackers " from the mountain areas of the south , Lithuanians and Poles frightened and lost as dumb cattle , rounded up in the draft net in Chicago slums , and negro bucks from Mississippi and Alabama . The negroes , perhaps because inured to slavery , have retained some semblance of animation , some shreds of happiness . 73 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " They are segregated in a separate class , and there is a lightness and humor in this group that I enjoy . But the others .. . I open the primer , a specially prepared primer calculated to arouse martial enthusiasm and love of country . " Alvin , will you begin reading on page three , please ? " Alvin arises . He is stooped , weazened , an hereditary venereal victim from the back-hills of Kentucky . He has the brain of a six-year-old ; the body of a man of seventy . But his age is twenty-three . " This is our flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . " What are the colors of our flag ? Red , white , and blue . Our flag has never done wrong . " " Is that true , Alvin ? " " I du n no . " " Sure . Sure , " whispers the boy next to Alvin . " Sure , " says Alvin . " Why are we at war , Alvin ? And whom are we fighting ? " Alvin studies the book carefully . 74 CAMP TAYLOR " I did n't read that fur , " he complains . I look at the corporal , who brought the men from the barracks . The corporal is dozing by the open window . It is very hot and close in the room . " We 'll skip this page and skip the next page , " I announce , " and go on to this story about the cow . " Alvin grins . He knows cows . But he does n't know why a recruiting officer summoned him before the draft board and sent him to camp , where they will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hungry pits in France . Alvin does n't have to know . The pits are n't particular . Alvin , if he is patched up a bit , will be ready for the magnificent democracy of the charnel house . August 23. -I am still teaching reading , eight hours a day now , to the mental and physical cripples of the Development Battalion . It is dull and depressing , this business of facing a roomful of uniformed debris and looking into vacuous faces . The men are pitiful . Added to their bodily ailments is a kind of psychological malaria that leaves them inert , shiftless , sodden . The routine of the barracks has dried 75 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " up whatever founts of animal spirits they may have come to camp with . They are docile ? docile as the dead . Corporals call their disease " bunk fever , " and make periodic attempts to prod them into life ; but the poor rookies have developed enormous powers of resistance to stimuli and when pressure is removed they collapse like paper bags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army ! More amusing than my efforts to teach them the mysteries of reading are the attempts of the Y.M.C.A. officials to initiate them into the delights of patriotism . The officials make impassioned pleas , but the elocutionary masterpieces fall into a dead silence . Even the well-worn slogans of this war , so effective with the average audience , are lost upon the waterlogged backwash of the Development Battalion . Love of fatherland is not instinctive ; it is implanted , and no seeds have sprouted in these , distorted bodies . How can a Georgia negro , sick with fever caught in a prison camp , or a boy fresh from the horror of a Kentucky soft-coal mine vision Uncle Sam as a benign Santa Claus for whom it would be very pleasant to get blown to bits by a 76 CAMP TAYLOR German hand grenade ? I talked with the lad from the coal district yesterday . He is tall , emaciated , bent with rheumatism . " From working in the pits , " he said , " at $2.40 a day . My father died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stakes long ago , but the company owns our house and they would 've chucked my mother and the kids in the street . We are always in debt to the company , and if I 'd cleared out I 'd had a fat chance to land a job somewheres else , what with the blacklist and the company dicks . So I hung on , till they grabbed me in the last draft , rheumatism and all . I 'm sending home my allotment , but I bet it 's going hard with ' em . I 'm glad I 'm not getting letters from home . My mother ca n't read or write . " When the Y.M.C.A. official takes over the Americanization class , dwelling on the excellencies of democracy which are being imperiled by the Hun , the boy from the coal fields sits with his shoulders hunched and stares at the pine floor of the hut . There is no resentment in his face , only a great emptiness . The speaker is dealing with symbols as strange as Sanskrit . " Liberty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Happiness . " What meanings can these words convey to the hunched rheumatic , or the negro ill from confinement in a Georgia prison camp , or the two Lithuanian brothers ? not even citizens ? who were snatched from a Chicago sweatshop , led before a court , and in company with a hundred other puzzled aliens had first naturalization papers thrust into their hands a day before being herded to the military camp ? They sit with blinking eyes , moving cramped limbs , and now and then the corporal thumps for attention and there is a startled motion in the class like dead leaves stirred by a gust . " The objects of this war , " says the tightly-buttoned Y.M.C.A. speaker , mopping his brow , " have been defined by President Wilson in his message to Congress .... " Greek , man , you are talking Greek , say the tired eyes of the Battalion derelicts . After my eight hours of school , I walk a mile through camp to the tent colony of the Mennonites and reenter a world as alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parched lawn before the tents are a dozen grave figures , Bibles on knees , reading and 78 CAMP TAYLOR discussing in soft-spoken monotones . From the corner tent , under guard , comes the inevitable hymn of the prisoners . Here , too , the Americanization orators would be talking into the wind . The Mennonites have withdrawn themselves from political life as effectively as if they had migrated to the ! noon . They carry the shield of the Lord , waving no worldly banners . They treat me kindly , though there is still suspicion in their attitude , and a lingering resentment of my heresy . My three tent-mates go each night into a neighboring tent for a song and prayer meeting , mercifully leaving me to solitude and the handful of tiny Shakespeares and miniature books of poems which , concealed in the toes of my extra boots , I smuggled into camp . This is the full-moon season ; it is good to be alone at the tent-door , reading by candle-light , with the cornfield across the road freighting the air with the fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moonlight , and there is nothing so indescribably beautiful as a distant bugle blowing taps . . . . There may be an end to even this fugitive beauty . To-79 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " morrow , we hear , we are to be removed to Camp Sherman , Ohio , where we will be given a hearing by a special board and then either sent to work on the farms ? or to Leavenworth . The moon and the cornfield seem doubly precious to-night . 8o CAMP SHERMAN Trial by Stagnation CAMP SHERMAN , Ohio , August 26 , r9i9. ? The tents of the Christian crusaders are ranged on the outskirts of this military reservation like the slightly bedraggled fringe on the robe of Mars . Our colony lacks the color and war-cries of the army that lay before Antioch , but its roster is as varied as the rollcall of the nations who poured into Palestine . There are Mennonites , Molokans , Christadelphians , Plymouth Brethren , Adventists , Quakers , and members of the Church of God ( Holiness ) , Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students , and the House of David . There are some 16o of us , and we are an extra thumb , a sore thumb on the military fist ? not even a thumb , for we are too minute , too impotent . To the east of us range the endless barracks , housing 6o,000 conscripts ; behind us to the west rises a steep , wooded bluff , and we are caught between the barracks and the bluff 83 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " forty tentfuls of hymn-singing religionists and myself , refusing to wear uniforms or go to war , and waiting for the lightning to strike . I arrived here last night , together with the Mennonites from Camp Taylor , and presently a board will sit in judgment upon us and our ludicrous Children 's Crusade will be added to the long record of historical gestures . I said that we were a slightly bedraggled fringe on the robe of Mars , and the simile is accurate . We trail in the mud . We sleep on cots in tents without floors . All day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud of Ohio clay . Our wet , wrinkled civilian clothes cling to us in knots and bunches . Can I blame the lieutenant who this morning observed us lined up for roll-call for turning to the sergeant and saying : " A fine bunch of lousy rats we have here , sergeant ? " Can I blame the sergeant 's nose for wrinkling as if a flea had bitten him ? I ca n't . We cut a sorry figure , incomprehensible to the military mind , choosing the foul rags of madness for the sweet good sense of martial splendor ? for we are insane , officially , having been solemnly assured by the intelligence testers that we 84 CAMP SHERMAN are egocentrics suffering from the Saviour mono-mania and other fixations . " Lousy rats , sergeant , " said the lieutenant , and I wondered that he did not blow a whistle to summon the exterminator squad . Well , some of us may be exterminated . A corporal this morning told us with relish that a communique on the captain 's table carried the news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shot by musketry until dead . Which may or may not be true , but the speculation is fascinating . Especially on this rainy day , this muddy , lugubrious day , with the hymns of the Cru saders arising from a tent here and a tent there in fragments unspeakably melancholy . The bluff , drip-ping wet , would make an interesting background for the execution squad . ' I wander , a crusader without God or hymnal , from tent to tent and poke my nose into their gloom . In each tent a knot of religionists hunched on their 85 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " cots to keep off the floor awash with rain and mud . In each tent singing of psalms , reading of Bibles , writing of letters and endless theological disputes . The Pentecostals hear mystic voices in the air . The Molokans are guided by the Holy Spirit and sometimes they are possessed of the spirit and jump up and down under its behest , and so are called Holy Jumpers . The International Bible Students believe that the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and foolish to engage in earthly war when His day is imminent . The Amish Mennonites will not fight or shave ; the Quakers will not hate ; but despite the enormous cleavage of beliefs there is in each group the stamp of tolerance , and kindliness and courage . But arguments are endless . I hear amazing discourse . " How tall are you ? " asks one Crusader of another while the rain plops on the canvas roof and the hours drag . " Me ? I 'm just six feet . " " No , brother , you ca n't be . " " Why ca n't I be , Menno ? " " You may be just a bit over six feet or just a bit 86 CAMP SHERMAN under six feet , but you ca n't be six feet exactly , brother . " " Why not ? " " Because there 's just one person in the whole world who is just exactly six feet , brother , and that 's the Lord God . " There is a buzz of comment , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and verse to dumfound doubters . " How you must study the Book , " cries one . " I do , " nods the law-giver . " I know much of it by heart . I am not an Amish Mennonite , brother , but I can tell you why an Amish Mennonite will not shave his beard or his head and thinks the razor the invention of Satan . See , brother , here : Leviticus 19:27 , where it is set down that Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard . ' You will find many strange laws in the Bible , brother . " Into the tent comes a colored youth , smiling , very much at home . " Brewer ! " cry the Crusaders . " Stay with us , Brewer .

He annoys the officers by trying to convert them . He is a Southern Baptist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awaiting assignment to the camp base hospital . We are a curious crew , waiting in the rain for the end . August 27. - This is written by the light of a candle in a tent musty with the smell of damp blankets , wet clothes and the acrid odor of mud . Across from me , seated on one cot , are my three Mennonite tent-mates , listening to one of them , Yoder , read from the Bible . The boys ' faces are more than ordinarily grave , and there is a special heaviness in Yoder 's voice as he reads the narrative of the Saviour 's walk to Golgotha . The silence is invaded only by his voice and the rain plopping on the canvas and splashing in the pool under the ridge outside . The neighboring tents , too , are silent . When I thrust my head out of the door a moment ago I heard no hymns or hallelujahs anywhere ; the whole Crusaders ' colony is wet , desolate and quiet . Perhaps they all are praying as Yoder is praying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of it to-night . We passed to-89 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " day through the third degree ; our consciences have been officially weighed and analyzed , and you shall soon learn , dear wife , whether to write me here or in the guardhouse . I confess I share the heaviness that presses upon my religious friends ; though the thought of prison has almost become too familiar to be frightening . Perhaps it is only the eternal rain , and my loneliness . I can speak neither the tongue of the Crusaders nor the jargon of the military men . To-day the board appointed by the President to give a hearing to the war objectors was in Camp Sherman . The board is composed of Dean Harlan Stone of the Columbia law school , Judge Julian Mack of Chicago and Major Walter Kellogg of the Army , but only Dean Stone was here to conduct the inquiry . He was , I assure you , enough . The trial was held in the captain 's cottage at the end of the long double line of Crusaders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tents , we were herded in the rain ? a hundred and sixty slovenly men whispering encouragement to each other and wondering at the travail that lay behind the closed door of the cottage . We were divided into groups , 90 CAMP SHERMAN according to our professed faiths : there were a large knot of Mennonites , a knot of Quakers , and smaller handfuls of a half-dozen other religious schools . And I ? because I belong to no church ? was unclassified and was placed alone at the tail end of the long line . A sergeant in a slicker herded the groups into the cottage , one by one . Long moments passed , and he herded them out again , with commands to return at once to their tents and not mingle with the waiting line . The men who had survived the ordeal passed by us gravely , with unreadable faces . I learned later that their hearings had been swift , and their interrogation simple . " Were they non-resisting Christians , members of a recognized sect ? " They were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglar would they try to stop the burglar or do him harm ? " They would not . " Would they accept a farm furlough ? " They would . " That will be all , sergeant . " Two long hours in the drizzle . The long line melted away . I faced the door . The sergeant called my name . 91 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " The little room was filled with men in uniform . Dean Stone sat at a table , with a stenographer next to him . I think , comrade , I went a little dizzy with stage fright and the weariness of the long wait , standing motionless in the rain . The room was warm , crowded , hostile , and for a brief space I felt that I was back at the dean 's office in the University when six grave men expelled me from the campus for unpatriotic conduct . But here I felt more hemmed in , more lost . Dean Stone , sharp-eyed , keen , fired questions at me for twenty minutes . I stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my wet , muddy shoes left a pool on the floor . The pool seemed to have some fascination for the captain at the Dean 's side ? he shifted his glance from my shoes to my face , and I could feel the contempt in his eyes , and the collective contempt of the ring of officers which was understandable but more goading than blows . I ca n't write you , comrade , of the inquisition in detail , for the words are lost in a maze . What I recall most vividly is the scrutiny of the captain , and the swift , sharp questions of the Dean rapped out 92 CAMP SHERMAN one after the other with the precision of hammerblows . But I remember that the chief argument centered about the distinction between force and warfare . " You are a member of no church ? " " No , sir . " " Socialist ? " " I share many of their beliefs , but I am not a member of the party . " " What would you do if you were attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape your wife or mother ? " " Resist him . Try to save my wife . " " Then how can you maintain your position in opposition to war ? You sanction the use of force . " " I see no analogy whatever in your comparison . I ca n't concede that this is a defensive war , or that the issue can be stated as simply as your burglar illustration suggests . You imply in this war one side is an innocent wife or mother and the other side a fiend . I ca n't admit this . Also , in the case of me against the burglar , I may have no other resource except my fist ; I am dealing with one individual . 93 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " But in war we are dealing with nations , and no nation is composed exclusively of thugs and degenerates . It seems to me that America , as the outstanding neutral , could have exerted enough pressure to bring about peace without resorting to arms , for in all the warring countries there are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for peace through negotiation . " " Other means have been tried . They failed , " said the Dean . " They were not tried with the same vigor , the same sacrifice that we have mobilized in the war . If the same amount of energy , money , organization and labor had been expended in securing a crystallization of the peace sentiment among the nations nothing could have resisted it . " " Your country made the choice . It is up to you to abide by it . " " There are times when the individual must withdraw himself from the state , if he feels his deepest convictions of right and wrong invaded . This is one of those times . I can not aid in the destruction of life when I feel that no happiness is gained by it , 94 CAMP SHERMAN or no honest cause advanced . There may come an ideal ' war in which I could throw myself , but this is not one , and I doubt if there has ever been one in all history except the revolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict between two camps of international bankers , seeking wider spheres of influence , and after this war ends I see new alignments of powers , a new scramble for profits , and another war unless the workers ? exploited by all governments ? fold their arms and refuse to share in it . " The captain 's eyes traveled again from my shoes to my face and I caught his angry glance . But the Dean remained impassive . " I consider you a political objector , " he said , " one of those men who believes himself wiser and better informed than any man in the country . That is all . " " He can go , sergeant , " said the captain . I followed the sergeant out of the room into the muddy lane between the tents . . . . Yoder is still praying , comrade , and it is still very quiet except for the rain and his voice . 95 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " August 29 . ? We are poised on the fence , waiting for anything . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the war department , and more weeks before we receive word whether we are prison-bound . The dragging days are filled in with the routine of this segregated camp ; we volunteer for various clean-up jobs of weed-cutting , or roadmending ; we chop wood for the kitchen stoves , and the nights , for all except myself , are filled with prayer and song , and devotional services in the messhall after supper . My library of tiny books , hidden in my extra boots , has escaped detection . The tents , I was told , have n't been searched for some weeks , and you would smile , comrade , at the joy I take in forbidden delights ? even if so highly respectable as Shakespeare . I have finished " Tempest " and " King Lear , " and have found a new savor in them . Especially in the robust hullabaloo of Lear , perhaps because he is so shockingly out of tune with the softspoken holiness of the Crusaders . My eyes failed me in the dim candlelight last night , and I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess-hall which has open , screened walls . 96 CAMP SHERMAN It was crowded with my Mennonite , Christadelphian and Adventist friends , bowing their heads in the half-light shed by a couple of oil lamps , while one of them spoke a prayer that seemed never to end , never to vary in its solemn monotone . As I listened , a man in soldier 's uniform came up , and stood next to me , and he took off his hat and bowed his head . I looked at him in astonishment . The prayer at length ended amid a chorus of devout " Amens ! " and the soldier next to me added a " praise God ! " looking very sad . " Hello , " I said . " Hello , " he replied . " Why do n't you go in and join them ? " I asked . " I ca n't . I feel a little like a traitor , " he said soberly . " I belong here . I came as a war objector . But they broke me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel sick in the filthy barracks , and I feel sick here . " The prayer meeting was breaking up . The soldier put on his hat and walked swiftly across the field toward the barracks as if he were fleeing from something . There are other diversions . This morning I was summoned into the captain 's office . I have been 97 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " told he is a college graduate , and it was , perhaps , to air his logic that he called me . He said he had been thinking about my testimony at the hearing and considered my position not only unwise but unphilosophical . He demonstrated the necessity for war ; the impetus it gives to masculine virtues , to art , to poetry , to the soul of a nation . He stressed the biological universality of war , the weapons of offense and defense with which the insect and animal world are accoutered . I listened respectfully . He wound up by offering me an assignment in the base hospital . " You will not even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of the soldier last night , with his " praise God " and his hurried departure for the barracks , doubly tortured because he had accepted both the uniform and the Cross and now could find no peace anywhere . Social pariahs we may be , but it is worse to be an outcast in one 's own sight . It has been raining almost steadily for days . We are all ill-at-ease , dejected and lumpish . Prayers may be helping the Crusaders to remain steadfast , but 98 CAMP SHERMAN they do not inspire brilliance or humor . And King Lear may aid me in routing the army of leaden hours , but he is not a light-hearted companion . Would I had tucked away some tiny volume of Anatole France or Cabell or Shaw in my extra pair of boots . How dreary it is ! September i. ? A taste of freedom . This is Sunday , and our captain gave us permission to climb the hill behind the camp for devotionals . A Mennonite preacher with long beard and gentle eyes came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the wooded slope to a clearing on the hillside . It had stopped raining , but the woods were still wet and redolent , infinitely sweet after the mud of the camp . The Crusaders stopped at the clearing and sat on logs , but I unobtrusively vanished in the shadows and continued to climb high , high up to the very crest of the hill . The sun was pleasant , the woods fragrant , the war seemed very far away ; it was as though I were back again in the glen in the Baraboo hills long before mad-99 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " ness came upon the world . Far below the brethren began their hymns : " We 're marching to Zion , Beautiful , beautiful Zion ... " But often , when a cicada shrilled , and a thousand crickets contributed their minor bars , even the voices of the choir sounded muted . . . . A mottled , sober old horse shared my freedom . He too seemed to snuff and wheeze luxuriously as he browsed ? an army horse , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I wondered what damnable power prevented him and me from kicking up our heels and racing over the hilltop to the liberty of distant pastures . He was not hobbled ; neither was I , yet I knew he would respond meekly to his master 's whistle , and that I , when the hour was up , would as meekly climb down the hill again to resume the yoke . . . as I did . And on the way back I passed the company stockade and my Sunday was spoiled . Thirty prisoners were behind the barbed wire fence , twisting their bodies into calisthenic contortions while a drill sergeant barked commands , " One , two , ioo CAMP SHERMAN three , four ! One , two , three , four ! " Five men , without uniforms , stood a little to one side . They were war objectors , and refused to obey the sergeant 's commands , and for an hour afterward they will continue to stand there , motionless , as punishment . A huge stone slab is stuck into the earth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the inscription . The slab looks like a gravestone , very solemn and white . It seems such a long way from the brigade prison to the top of the hill where horses and men have an hour of joy in the fragrant forest . September 2 . ? The week opens auspiciously . I have made a friend , a whimsical , light-hearted friend as refreshing as rain after a drought . Not that the Christian Crusaders are n't friendly ; not that I do not admire their gentleness and courage , but ah , comrade , how dull are the hours filled only with theological dispute and hymn-singing . When not engaged in these pious pursuits they are ? most of them ? inarticulate shadows in my tent , humor Ioi " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " less as pulpits . They have given up praying with me , though I believe Yoder still includes me in his prayers and silent meditations by candlelight and I love him for it . Yet I far rather would hear him laugh , and his laugh , I feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his murmured devotions . But this morning I heard a laugh , and made a friend . We were whitewashing stones to place around the fringe of lawn and field that separates the camp of war objectors from the soldiers ' barracks . We worked quietly , gravely , dipping the stones in buckets of lime , while a corporal sat on his haunches on a grass plot , yawning . Suddenly a boy whom I had not noticed before came toward our group . He had been working on the far end of the lawn . He was very short , wiry , and his one-piece overalls , many sizes too large , hung baggily from his shoulders . " Corporal , " he said snappily , flirting his hand to his cap in mock salute , " we 're running out of marshmallows for our lawn party . " " Marshmallows ! " asked the corporal . 102 CAMP SHERMAN " Yeah . These white pebbles for our company graveyard . " The corporal grinned . " All right , Bill , " he said amiably . " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , nodding to me , " you go along and help . " The boy in overalls turned to me . His eyes were bright , pert as a cock-sparrow . " I 'll be glad to help you , " I said , " but you 're wrong about the lawn party . So far I 've found it only a yawn party . " He squinted at me , startled . Then he laughed and put out his hand . " My name 's Davy , Bill Davy , " he said , " and I 'm tickled to death to salute the first pun I 've heard in two months . " He saluted again , soberly . Then he linked his arm in mine and we walked to the stone-pile . It was a joyous discovery . We talked at top speed while we filled the barrow with rocks . He was from Cleveland , a Socialist , a devout friend and admirer of Eugene Debs , and he spoke of Debs with love as " that grand old man with a soul that never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign tacked on it . " " But they 're breaking him , " he said angrily , " they 're mobbing him ; and I bet they wo n't rest till they 've locked the good old man in the pen . Well , that 's the only place for a sane and honest man anyhow . " He explained that although he was a Socialist he had come to camp as a religious objector , being enrolled on the membership list of a Cleveland Congregational church whose pastor , too , had been very radical and anti-war . " And I 've been here two months , " he sighed , " nearly dying of the woolies . They 're giving me the creeps with their eternal hymns and prayer meetings . Oh , boy , can you imagine my joy when my wife came to see me last Sunday and smuggled this into my tent inside a lunch-basket ? " He pulled a crumpled magazine from inside his shirt . It was a copy of The Liberator , Max Eastman 's radical monthly , brimful of revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but hymn books and the Christian Science Monitor . I told him of myself . We shook hands again . Comrade , I 'm afraid to confess I nearly wept for joy . My isolation is ended . I have found a friend 104 CAMP SHERMAN who can joke , laugh , fill the dreary hours with talk of books and life . He was as happy as I. " Listen , " he said , as we trundled the barrow back to the field , " I 'm in a tent with two Mennonites and an Adventist . They 're fine boys , but they 're driving me cuckoo . The tent is one of the three tents in our outfit that has a floor and a stove , and I suppose I 'll have a hard job inducing one of the boys to give up our warm nest for a mudpen . But I 'll do it ? I have to do it in sheer self-defense . And then you move in , see ? " " I 'd love to . But are you sure you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , " said Bill Davy . " Why , I 've even made friends with the corporal ? whenever he gets on his ear I tell him the yarn about the Scotchman and the merry-go-round and he eats out of my hand . " For the rest of the afternoon Davy and I worked side by side . A weight has gone from me . As an added happiness on this good day the sun came out ; the ditches in front of our brown tents dried and the mists rose from the valley , swirling over the roofs of the barracks across the field . . . . It is after supper Io5 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " now , and the Crusaders are praying again in the mess-hall , but I can leap across the ditch to Davy 's tent and listen to his laughter . September 3. - This morning I was detailed to the road gang , very sorry that Davy remained behind . I shoveled gravel from a gravel pit into a wagon ; back-breaking work after the first hour , but the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is pleasant to work outdoors with men and horses . Outdoors the Crusaders became cheerfully human ; perhaps because they are a farming people , the Mennonites are depressed more than the ordinary mortal when confined to camp . Working on the roadside they relaxed and laughed ; sobriety dropped from them like a dark mantle . We shoveled gravel to the rhythm of a marching hymn , but there was more humor than holiness in the singing . Truckloads of soldiers from camp passed by us on the road ; not even their jeers checked our song or our cheerfulness . . . . When I came back to camp this evening I found that I had missed something . Two Y.M.C.A. officials had come to camp . The captain had or io6 CAMP SHERMAN dered the war objectors to file into the mess-hall for a lecture , and the Y.M.C.A. men had heaped reproaches on the Crusaders ' heads for being too Christian and not going to war . The Crusaders , I was told , had accepted the lecture meekly enough , but Bill Davy had arisen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been a violent argument , and many curious responses by the Y.M.C.A. gentlemen , who tried to prove by quotation and logic that the Prince of Peace would have shouldered a musket and butchered the Hun to the tune of " The Yanks Are Coming ! " . . . And as a final joy this day , Davy came to my tent to-night . " I 've worked it , " he said . " To-morrow you move into my tent . I shall tell the butler to expect you , my lord . " September 6. - Bill Davy and I have formed a defensive alliance against the melancholy Mennonites , but it pains me to report that we have been routed . Our tent is crowded with the four cots and the little cone-shaped stove . It is the stove that is the chief cause of our defeat . Almost all of the tents in the Crusaders ' colony are unheated ; the nights have 1o7 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " been brisk with autumn chill , and the poor fellows are freezing in their wigwams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , each evening , a great company of Mennonites , Adventists , Christadelphians , Pentecostalites and Plymouth Brethren swarms into our crowded tent to huddle around the stove . They sit on the cots , they squat on the floor , they stand up near the doorway . The air is heavy with the smell of steaming clothes . Davy and I , crowded into one tiny corner near a kerosene lamp , ambitiously try to read our forbidden books , and suffer in silence . Suffering in silence is endurable , but ah , comrade , it is terrible indeed when the silence is shattered by the bellow of human voices proclaiming the sweetness of salvation . I do not jest at their devotion ; I almost envy their fervor ? I only wish it were not so prodigiously vocal . And they know so many , many hymns ; they are so untiring , have such an amazing capacity for noise . " Oh , come , come , come , come , Come to the church in the hollow ... " io8 CAMP SHERMAN The voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I swear , stirs up eddies of fetid air that makes the oil lamp flicker , and sends the distorted shadows of the Crusaders wavering across the roof and walls of the tent in fantastic arabesque . Davy and I yearn over our books , and I read in that precious little volume of Sonnets and Poems by William Ellery Leonard , which he gave me , you recall , on the day I left for camp , a line or two that gives me faint amusement amid the racket : " We must be heroes . Earth 's old rivers flow , But earth 's religions comfort us no more . . . " and I wonder whether they were written amid similar volcanic piety which in truth holds little comfort for a sensitive ear . We must be heroes , indeed . ... Comrade , I do not sneer at my brothers in exile ; they have proved their mettle more than I have mine , but they are so inexorably , robustly boisterous in their bravery . " Life is like a mountain railroad . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high notes , but roars to a triumphant refrain . Davy slips 109 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " his Liberator under the pillow , and cries into my ear : " Can you stand any more ? " I shake my head and put away my book , and we put on our coats and climb out of the tent over the shoulders of the floor-squatters . The air outdoors is brisk and clear . We walk up and down the road between the tent rows , drawing deep breaths . " Do you know , duke , " says Davy dejectedly , jamming his chilled hands deep into his coat pockets , " when we 're sent to Leavenworth with the psalmsingers I 'm going to break every rule in the place and spend the rest of my life in solitary confinement . I hear they have a dungeon deep , deep down in the ground , where it is so dark and quiet that you can hear your thoughts rattle like peas in a pod . Can there be silence anywhere in the world , duke ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God will take care of you , For all the way , through all the day , He will takc care of you , He will take care , take care of you ... " IIo CAMP SHERMAN We walk up and down till we are weary , reluctant to surrender . Then I say : " We are stupid . We must obey biological necessity and adapt ourselves to our environment . " " What do you mean ? " " We must sing . " Davy blinks at me . " By golly , your honor , I never thought of that . " So we climb into the tent again , and bellow with the boys till the lamp-chimney quivers . Davy 's rumpled cap is pulled over his eyes . He lifts his face to the tent peak and squeals an atrocious tenor . His thin , comical face looks almost Mephistophelian in the midst of the whiskered gravity of the Mennonites . At length everybody is hoarse or exhausted ; the hymn singing ends , and the Crusaders plunge into prayer and theological dispute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their frosty tents . We blow out the lamp and crawl into our cots . In an hour the stove goes out . The chill air blows through holes in the canvas and seeps upward through the floor and we turn and twist in our III " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " cold cots . We have no bed-ticks . We sleep on top of a thick layer of Christian Science Monitors , the only paper that is delivered to the c. o. camp . I awake often during the night and hear the crackling of newspapers as the Crusaders shift their cramped , cold limbs in troubled sleep . September 8 . ? Sunday , and the hillside again with the deep shadows and shreds of sunshine , the trellis work of branches and hanging vines against the sky , and the inevitable " We Are Marching to Zion " of the Mennonite choir down the slope . The choir has the upper hand to-day , for the crickets are subdued ; many of them died during the cold nights this week , and the cicadas are buried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things ? my tiny volume of Sonnets from the Portuguese . Davy , you know , has never gone beyond graded school ; he is twenty-five and has worked at many jobs , but somewhere he has acquired a love of literature . He had never read Shakespeare ? lucky fellow ? and so never had his love for the lusty bard ruined by high 112 CAMP SHERMAN school pedagogues . I gave him " Tempest " and Lear , " which he accepted gingerly as " high-brow twaddle , " but he has read them with zest and joy , interrupting me often with great phrases of the mad king and Caliban which he repeats with the joy of a discoverer . . . . And now he is deep in the lyrics of Mrs. Browning . A moment ago we were interrupted by two negro soldiers who had straggled up the hill . They stopped , thinking we were farmer boys , and chatted about camp . " The worst part about camp , " said one of them , " is that there ai n't no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my friend 's eyes snap . He rose to his feet . " Beat it ! " he cried . " We had all we want from you . " The soldiers , strangely , took no apparent offense and slouched away up the hill . Davy turned to me , puzzled . " Wonder what 's happened to me , duke , " he laughed . " You gave me Shakespeare and it made me high-brow . Now you give me these sonnets and they make me pure . But honest , duke , " he pleaded apologetically , " after reading these beautiful poems , hearing those yaps was just like falling from a mountain m3 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " into a pile of manure . " . . . How I like this Social-ist scamp , comrade . If we are prison-bound , I pray we go together . September 9. - Through an odd meeting this morning I learned that I was slated for prison . Do n't wince , comrade . We have braced ourselves for the ordeal , having faced it since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The news came as a blow , of course , but whatever distress I felt has been replaced by a feeling of confidence and a bit of relief that un-certainty is ended . There will be friends in Leaven-worth . This morning , as Davy and I were standing in front of our tent , an officer , walking from the cap-tain 's office , glanced at me . He stopped , looked at me fixedly and came over to me . We recognized each other . He was Felton , a classmate way back in high school . I almost held out my hand , but remem-bering the moral breach between a soldier in cap-tain 's uniform and a yellowback in dirty overalls I only smiled and said I was glad to see him . " 41 CAMP SHERMAN " Do you mean to say , " he exclaimed , " that you belong to this c. o. outfit ? " " I do . " " Then I ca n't say that I 'm glad to see you , " he said sharply . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll be home inside of a few months ? we 'll be marching into Berlin before winter . And you 'll be respected when you get back . I hate to think of a classmate of mine in this lousy place . " " I feel quite happy here , Felton , " I said . " Wait here a moment . " He turned and retraced his steps to the captain 's office . In a few minutes he came back and called me aside . " Your Captain Hough and I are friends , " he said , " and I came here on a personal visit . I have just spoken to him about you . He went over your record and he assures me that you are bound for Leaven-worth . " " I expected that . " " But he added that you still have a chance . You can accept non-combatant service ? there 's still time , n5i " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " he said ? and it will be all right . Come , do n't be ridiculous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more think of swapping my overalls for your uniform than you would consider moving into our colony . " " You are merely being pig-headed . " " Perhaps . But I really think you 'd like me less if I backed out now . Since I 've come to camp , I 've been offered hospital and quartermaster service a half dozen times , and refused it . Would n't you consider me rather a worm if I 'd accept a uniform now that I know Leavenworth is waiting for me ? " " I ca n't see your point of view at all . I remember you as a promising fellow . You are ruining your future . I hope you reconsider before taking a step you will regret all your life . " I shook my head , and he left without further word . I walked back to the tent and Davy . I told Davy of our conversation . He looked morose for only a second , then he cackled an ironical laugh . " Leavenworth ? " he cried . " I salute you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary barracks . I hope we go together , pard . But if we I16 CAMP SHERMAN do n't , and I 'm on the outside , I swear I 'll climb the prison wall and toss you bon-bons through the bars . " September lo. ? They called for volunteers to-day to shovel manure on a farm two miles outside of camp , and a dozen of us responded . Far from being offensive , the work was delightful after the stagnation of the camp . Laugh at me , comrade , but I tell you there is something honest and vital in the pungency of a barnyard . The day was crisp and hazy . The base of the hill to the east was shrouded in mist , and Camp Sherman was out of sight . And almost out of mind . We had slipped a tether for a few hours , and exulted in our freedom . A line of wagons laden with manure came down the road , and Davy and I and two other boys climbed into them when they reached the broad field , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tent , wholesomely weary , ravenous and quite lighthearted . Are we so wedded to the grindstone that a little labor will bring release and rout despondency ? I almost feel that prison will be endurable with I17 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " labor as an anodyne , and that freedom , with nothing to do but brood darkly , would drive one sooner to madness . . . . Davy is already snoring in his cot . And the Mennonite tent-mates are so weary that they gave up , for to-night , their evening hymnsinging . An excellent end for a good day . September 12. - This morning , after we were lined up , we were given the opportunity of hearing a patriotic address by Governor Cox , who was a visitor at Camp Sherman . We elected , instead , to go out and shovel manure . September 13. - And this is Friday , too . Is there a fatalism in the dreaded combination ? Well , partly . As an unlucky item there is this : all but fourteen of the Crusaders ' camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application blanks for farm furloughs , the report from Washington having at last come through . Davy was one of them , but I was not . Which means , perhaps , court martial and I18 CAMP SHERMAN Leavenworth . Which means , definitely , that Davy and I will be separated . That is hard . On the other hand , this day has not been without brightness , for your good letter came , comrade , and the package of books ? which , heaven be thanked , were approved by the sergeant censor . Shaw , the Dial , the Nation , Pearson 's Magazine ? ah , how Davy and I crowed for joy as each new jewel came to light . And then ? more good fortune ? a telegram from Helen saying that she will pass through Chillicothe on her way east and will try to see me in camp . These things have blotted , for a time , the thought of everything but the delight of a friendly book , a friendly face and your kindness . The future seems very far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a good day , even if prison is right around the corner . For Helen came , comrade , and with her a bracing , clean wind from the world outside of our colony that has left me exhilarated and joyful . When she arrived I went with her to the captain 's " 9 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " office and asked whether she and I and Davy might climb the hill back of our camp for a few hours ' leave . Captain Hough was strangely kind ; if ever I meet him " afterwards " I shall want to thank him for his gift of these golden moments to-day ... . We left the gloomy Crusaders ' tents behind and climbed the muddy trail to the hill . Davy was in prime spirits ; never had his cap been twisted to more rakish a peak , never had his tongue raced more devilishly or his eyes been more alive with waggishness . . . . We climbed to the crest , and Helen spread out the picnic lunch she had brought with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sober prayers and voices of the Mennonite hymn-singers now rang to our laughter , and it was good to laugh in the mist that swirled up the hillside . It began to rain ; the drops tinkled on the crisp autumn leaves ; a fragrance rose from the loam , so overpoweringly sweet that I longed to take root in the black soil and cling to the hill through all the gay seasons . What matter if it rained ? what matter anything ? The magic of Helen 's talk carried me back to you , 120 CAMP SHERMAN comrade , and to the lakes and the skies and the friendship of Madison . She talked of you , and of her brother , who was court-martialed in Atlanta as a political war objector and whom I will probably see in Leavenworth . She talked of Parfrey 's Glen in the Baraboo hills and I remembered with a pang that dear refuge from a fretful world ? do you recall how its little waterfall , its springs and pines and musky caves stole over us like a benediction when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clashing swords and death ? Once more I was carried back there ; once more I slept on the balsam bed under the pines with the moon looking through the canopy of the gorge and the monotone of the water voices a whisper in our ears . . . . All these sights and sounds and feelings I recaptured while Helen talked of the sweet world , and yet below them lurked the nagging thought that in an hour it would be over , in an hour Davy and I would climb down the hill again and walk like ghosts into the ghostly row of tents , brown and wet in the rain . But the camp was mercifully invisible . Mist filled the wide valley , churned by gusts that fanned our Cl2I " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " cheeks like a moist breath , and a chill crept into the air . Then bugles blew somewhere in the vapor , ominous as the cock-crow that ends the revel of the dead in " Danse Macabre . " A little saddened , a little frightened at the nearness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the wet underbrush . Yes , there was the camp again , the rows upon rows of barracks , realities that the witchery of the swift hours on the hill had not made vanish . ... Helen is gone again ; a cab came for her from Chillicothe . She laughed good-by , and Davy and I laughed back , but when he and I crossed the muddy ditch to our tent and entered to find a dozen Crusaders drying their clothes around the stove it seemed that a light had gone out . But the sadness is gone again , comrade . I have the book from you that Helen brought me ? the calmness and the fine heresy of Thoreau are a tonic this night . September 17 . ? It is very late , very quiet . Davy and I have been sitting in the dark , talking , on our last night together . He leaves to-morrow , with most 122 // of the other Crusaders , to work on a West Virginia farm . I have given him , with your love , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oddly , formed an attachment for the King ? a " ruined pipe-organ , or a spiked cannon , " he called the mad monarch . So he leaves to-morrow with a pocketful of tragedy . It is hard to see him go . September i8. - Our colony is wrecked . Almost all of the tents have been pulled down and most of the Crusaders have left to work out their expiation behind the plow . With them has gone Davy . When 1 last saw him his short legs were bending under a burden of bed swaddling , a suit case and a pack of magazines , and he was too depressed to joke . They are shipping the religionists to West Virginia because the Ohio farmers , I hear , are up in arms against the " yellowbacks . " Our captain , I was told , recently received a telegram from Fulton county , Ohio , signed by the draft board which said that " The League of American Patriots " was aroused at the furlough of Mennonites and threatened mob 123 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So Davy and the Crusaders are off to West Virginia , and the handful who are left are in low spirits . We wait , wait , wait . My tent is thronged with a dozen glum figures . I have made the acquaintance of Garrett , a Quaker , who is leaving soon with the Friends ' Reconstruction Unit for France . He is a college grad , earnest , quiet . He told me of the Quakers ' work among the civilian war victims in the ruined towns , and won my admiration and enthusiasm . I could , I feel , join them and work whole-heartedly for the Unit . But there are barricades and red tape hard to vault . There is , besides , Leavenworth . This week , I hear , fourteen of us are to be taken there . ... We huddle around the stove , talking and speculating , and time hangs like a dead weight . September 24. - We are packed up and ready to start for Leavenworth . Fearing that my baggage will be searched for books , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in my extra shoes , and hope to smuggle them in along with your 124 CAMP SHERMAN letters , comrade . It is bright and cheerful to-day . We are in good spirits . ST . Louis , Missouri , September 25 . ? A short stop on the way to Fort Leavenworth . My thirteen Mennonite fellow prisoners are grouped at the forward end of this day coach , lustily singing a hymn . At the back of the coach are a score of negroes in ragged civilian clothes . They were rejected at the camp as physically unfit and are now singing and skylarking like children on a holiday . I mark the curious contrast in voices and song : the negroes led by a pockmarked cotton-picker in a black shirt , are raising a din with a Rabelaisian army ditty , while the religious choir up ahead is nobly concentrating on " We 're Marching to Zion . " Was ever such a mad freight gathered together in one car ? holiness and hilarity under one roof , roaring on through the night ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon was brilliant ; trees and houses sailed by so cleanly etched against the sky that they seemed black paper cut-outs unwinding from an endless 01251 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " roll . Once on a barren field I saw a dozen moving flares , like torches , and I thought of the Klan and southern lynching bees . Trees and towns and rivers and wide fields washed by moonlight ; all the lovely panorama of freedom and space left behind while we clattered on . To prison . . . to prison . . . to prison , said the hypnotic cadence of the rails . The negroes snored on the back seats ; the Crusaders gave up their songs , and only the murmur of a prayer by Yoder , across the aisle , came from the solemn forms in the dimmed light . . . . I slept little , sitting up in my seat through the endless night , yet the memory of the journey is already faded as if I had been drugged by strong opiate . . . . To-day all is clear again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . We are under guard . Have you visions of a squad of heavy-jowled fellows with guns and bayonets ? No , it is only our little sergeant , with revolver at hip . He laughs and jests with us . He is swayed by contempt and pity , and his pity seems to increase as we near the end of our journey . To our inquiries of what will happen in Leavenworth he shrugs his shoulders ? truthfully , for he knows as 126 CAMP SHERMAN little about our destiny as we do . . . . I shall toss this note out of the window at a wayside station and with it my doubts and fears . . . . The Mennonite singers have swung into another hymn . The negroes are roaring : " The Yanks Are Coming . " Whatever else the day holds , comrade , there is humor even in the depths . I cling to it , and to the thought of you , for comfort and strength . KANSAS CITY , Missouri , September 25. - Two hours ' stop-over while we wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on the edge of the stone viaduct that leads from the great Union station over the submerged network of tracks . Our guard , the sergeant , has remained in the station , ogling a girl who is handing out coffee and doughnuts to the rookies bound for camps . He gave us permission to wander around town and return within two hours . What is to prevent me from losing myself in the crowded streets , dropping out of sight till the great madness is over ? Nothing ? and everything . And yet this passing taste of liberty is dangerously sweet . 1271 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " I saw the ranchers fresh from the west , in high boots and sombreros , coming to sell their carloads of cattle on the Kansas City markets . There was a vigor in their walk , a breeziness in their laughter that stirred me with memories of the western mountains and plains that I had walked six years ago and that now seemed so unutterably far away . There was such a gulf between these ranchers and the sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City our train passed the hateful walls of the state penitentiary , a dirty building surrounded by high walls with corner towers manned by guards . The walls rise up very close to the rail tracks , and a few of the pitiful inmates peered out of the windows and waved through the bars . What savage hatred mankind . heaps upon its unfortunates . And just beyond the prison loomed the white dome of the capitol where righteous people make righteous laws . ... I must go back now to join the sergeant and my fellow prisoners . We reach Leavenworth to-night . 128 FORT LEAVENWORTH Trial by Darkness FORT LEAVENWORTH Trial by Darkness FORT LEAVENWORTH , Kansas , September 26 , 1918. - It is 6:3o in the morning . We are locked up in a great , rectangular cell , fourteen of us . The floor is cold concrete . The bars are thick as broomsticks . The lock on the grated door is enormous , and the keyhole in the lock is two inches long and broad as my thumb . The lock is turned . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leavenworth . I told you , comrade , I would cling to my humor whatever befell , and I find material for laughter in this : these non-resisting Christians who would not harm a hair of their enemy 's head or break a cherry crate to escape their persecutors , are locked behind iron bars with the murderer , the degenerate and the insane , as if their prayers could topple kingdoms and their limbs contaminate a world . Tigers ? Behold them . Yoder , looking sol-131J " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " emnly ridiculous in rumpled underwear , is kneeling at the side of his cot , his face buried in his hands , murmuring an unheard prayer . Pierson is whistling to himself ; he is more light-hearted than the rest . Sinks , very pale , is again looking at his cheap watch which fell on the stone floor from under his head when he awoke in great fright this morning as the sound of metallic clatter filled our cell . The racket was the noise of the turnkey 's reveille ? achieved by drawing his enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused us after a night of half-wakeful nightmares . The rest of the thirteen are lying on their canvas cots , silent , oppressed , some of them burrowing their faces in their arms as if to shut out the sight of our cage , dimly illuminated by a light in the corridor . But I can write , thanks to the kindness of the warden who took away my knife and books but left me my pencil and pad of paper . And in writing I escape the awful weight of the hours ; yes , I escape even the cage itself , for it brings me close to you , comrade , and to the woods and lakes of our home , now doubly dear . If Yoder , praying there by his cot , 132 FORT LEAVENWORTH is brought nearer to his Shepherd by his devotions , I am brought nearer to the green pastures by my memory ? and so we both escape , and the turnkey is thwarted , for his cage holds only our poor bodies , while our spirit , our fancy ( whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far ports . This is our triumph , comrade ; we are never truly fettered . The fort was dark when we arrived last night at io:3o . We left the train , bowing under our duffle bags , and filed along a gravel path leading through a park . Reversing the more popular quest , we searched for an entrance to prison . Our guard , the good sergeant , was as unfamiliar with the grounds as we were , and we aided cheerfully in scouting for the dreaded goal . At length , in the darkness , we came to a great wall on which at intervals loomed turrets mounted with brilliant searchlights that swept the crest of the brick barricade . A dog barked loudly somewhere . Sentries popped out of the turret directly overhead and in response to a query by our sergeant shouted directions . We marched silently around the base of the wall . Looking up we saw 133 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " barred windows , a number of which framed white and motionless forms . We came to a great arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow , separate section of the great gate by a keeper provided with an enormous key . We waited , crushed and wordless , while the sergeant conferred with an official in the office . Our relief was great when the sergeant returned with word that we were not to be kept here in the execrated " Disciplinary Barracks , " but were to go up the road to the guardhouse . The huge gate clanged behind us again ; the night air tasted sweet , but only for a moment . We reached the guardhouse , a long , low brick building with a broad veranda . The sleepy turnkey admitted us to an office . We were thoroughly searched . My Mennonite friends pleaded for their Bibles . The turnkey looked doubtful , muttering something about orders . " Come , let them have their Bibles , " urged our good friend , the sergeant . " I have come with these boys all the way from Camp Sherman and spent two days with them . They have not tried to kill me with their Bibles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep my paper and pencil ? " I asked . 134 FORT LEAVENWORTH " I promise not to saw my way out of the cell with the pencil . " This , too , he allowed ; he was bald , thin , amiable ; the ominous keys that he jangled from a great ring and his affected severity seemed out of keeping , as if a greengrocer walked abroad growling like Cerberus . He took us first up a narrow flight of stairs to a lavatory ; we washed , and were then led to our cell . We had been expected . Fourteen cots were in the cell . " Here you are , boys , " said the turnkey , as we filed in . The iron door closed behind us with a crash . I confess , comrade , that at the sound humor fled for a space . It seemed as if the iron door had been dropped upon my body , suffocating me . Every thought and feeling vanished except an unutterable sense of pressure and helplessness , such as I had once experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by strong and unfriendly powers . There was a giddiness and an inward sinking . I read the same dread in the faces of my thirteen friends ; we looked at each other and at the cell in fearful silence . 135 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " The tension was broken by the sergeant . He had come up the stairs to say good-by . Amazing tears were sliding down his cheeks . I shall always remember the sergeant 's tears ? a soldier crying ! He reached his hand through the bars and we shook it one by one . Then Pierson cried : " Let 's sing ! " Fear slipped from us like a noose untied . " Good ! " agreed Sinks . " And I know the right song . " " What is it , brother ? " " For This Is Like Heaven to Me . ' " There was laughter , a little hysterical . And then we stood in the middle of the cell and sang with all our power the old hymn . Our voices echoed in the empty corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The turnkey came shuffling up the stairs and lifted his hand that still held the ring of keys . " Boys , boys ! " he cried , alarmed . " Oh , let them sing , " said our sergeant . " They may not have long to enjoy themselves . " We roared the second verse . The turnkey stood 136 FORT LEAVENWORTH by , his bald head creased with worry . Our sergeant walked down the stairs , waving his hand in last good-by . Whatever malicious things I have said about the psalm-singers I take back , for that hymn in the iron cage sent the blood again to our fainting hearts and gave us a moment almost joyous . The bars and the twilight of prison are bad , but the silence is more frightening , more crushing than the thick walls . So I joined with enthusiasm in the singing , forgetting my hatred of the voices that had driven me mad in the noisy holiness of the Crusaders ' colony . We started another song : " We 're Marching to Zion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom corridor was shattered by the sound of whistling , boos and cat-calls . I may not have mentioned that our cell is really a cage within a cage ; there is an open space all around it between the bars and the walls of the guardhouse . It is , also , a doubletiered cell . We are quartered on the top tier , and the yells came from the prisoners in the tier below . " Pipe down ! " hooted a voice . " Pipe down , you 1371 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " Bible-bangers , we want to sleep . " " You said it , " yelled another . " They 'll sing a different tune after a week in the hole . " 1 We became quiet . The turnkey , meanwhile , had vanished . But while we were preparing for bed a prisoner walked up the stone steps from the office , where he was employed as orderly . He was dressed in a rough blue shirt and brown pants with a num-138 FORT LEAVENWORTH ber painted on each leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a strangely pale youth and , I swear , the most beautiful I had seen in all my life . He had black hair , and his large , dark eyes looked out of the pallor of a face exquisitely chiseled . In the half-lit corridor , and against the background of stone and steel , he looked fantastical as a delicate tea-cup . Can you imagine then , my amazement when he spoke to us in a voice 139 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " as musical as a young girl 's ? but in a language so obscene that it would shame the vocabulary of a hack-driver ? The Crusaders shrank back as from a plague , but I beckoned this weird boy to a corner of the cell and spoke to him between the bars . " What are you in for ? " I asked . " Insubordination . Twenty-five years . I was bumped off by a sniveling first loot for calling him a bastard . And when I was court-martialed they charged me with everything but rape . They tore that page out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where do you come from ? " " Oklahoma . That 's God 's country , but God did n't stay there long enough to finish it . " " These men in the cell down below us , " I asked . " What are they in for ? " " Murder , " said the boy . " They belong in the Disciplinary Barracks , but they were transferred to the guardhouse here the other day to be held as witnesses in a murder case . The murder happened right there in the disciplinary barracks . There was a gang of prisoners violating rules ? they 'd sneak to-140 FORT LEAVENWORTH bacco in their shoes and such things ? and one of them peached to the guard . The damn fool thought he 'd get strong with the commandant . Well , they found this stool-pigeon dead in the corridor with his skull broken ? bashed in by a dozen heels as if a whole gang had jumped on his head . " My scalp tingled at the horror of the picture and his callousness . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the corridor with little , dancing steps , a beautiful moth in the twilight . The prisoners below had stopped their noise , and it was deathly still now . And that stillness , comrade , crept like a live thing through the corridors . Prison silence is not like the silence of the woods , where each little rustle , each little breaking twig is the record of the passing of some free bird or beast ; for every tiny noise within these walls drives home with cruel force the fact of our captivity . They are all furtive and metallic . A distant door grates on iron hinges . A heel scrapes on the stone floor . A bolt slides raspily into its socket . ... These were the little sounds that came out of 141 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " the darkness around our cage as we lay wakeful in our cots . Wakeful so long . The Crusaders turned restlessly on their beds , whispering now and then to each other . Pierson , the Pentecostalite , who believes in mysterious " voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wondered if he were waiting confidently for his angels to cleave through the stone walls and murmur devout messages into his ears . I wondered what hopes and dreams were bracing the others in this hour . In prison a man lives inwardly , drawing life from the storehouse of his past , and if his past has been rich with friendship , study and the out-of-doors , his memory will sustain him through many long hours in the dark and silence . So , at least , I thought as I lay awake and let my fancy wing homeward to perch at last tranquilly on your shoulder , comrade . How clearly I saw you , and the garden behind our house , and the crest of Castle Rock where we looked down at a drowsing village and the shadowy waves of the blowing wheat . I saw the glen and its hoary rocks again , the bay of shells in Mendota , the reeds dipping delicate 142 FORT LEAVENWORTH tips into the Wingra marshes , the spring rich with watercress ? the thousand and one delights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , then , that I should ever draw upon this storehouse for strength ; and yet I must have had some premonition , for how else could I have been guilty of such miserliness ? Sounds and sights and fragrances that I thought long forgotten came back again as I plucked them from my hoard , and with them came back faces , voices , songs : " Ich ging einmal spazieren , Ah-hm ! Ah-hm ! " I hummed the old melody delightedly , recalling Dr. Ernst Feise , his guitar , his rich tenor , and a fullmoon night on a canoe under Eagle Heights . Pierson must have heard me , for he turned in his cot and his voice came out of the dark : " What 's the matter ? Are you crying ? " " No , " I said , " I 'm laughing . " " It 's a long night . " " It is . The longest I 've ever known . Have you heard your voices ' yet , Pierson ? " 143 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been luckier . I 've heard voices . " " God 's voice ? " he asked solemnly . " No , just a friend 's . But it was just as wonderful . " " I wish they would stop snoring , " he said . " It 's driving me crazy . " And then I became aware of the sound of men snoring in the cell below us . The prisoners down there were not lying awake as we were . Marvelous how men can adjust themselves and survive ; they have learned to surrender , and do not beat themselves against the walls of their cage like a wild bird till they die . . . . The sound of the prisoners ' slumber was the last thing I recall before I fell into restless sleep . I awoke often , feeling the cold of the bars and the stone floor as a presence in the cell , a distinct , frozen shadow in the night . And when dawn wavered through the barred windows the memories that had sustained me in the dark fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dim light were too stark and terrible . I shut my eyes against them and turned face downward , and a chill slid through me . . . . How glad I was when the dreadful spell was broken by the rattle of the 144 FORT LEAVENWORTH turnkey 's huge key against the bars and the sound of his voice : " Everybody out , boys . " And I took comfort , I am ashamed to say , in the fright of Sinks , who leaped from his cot with such terrified haste that his watch slid from under his pillow and crashed to the floor , where it lay in fragments . The picture of Sinks , in his underclothes , sighing over his ruined time-piece , routed our wretchedness ; he finally joined in our laughter . " It stopped at three minutes past six , " he said . " I shall keep it this way till I die , just to remember this night . " And since then , comrade , except for the interval of breakfast , I have been writing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps down the corridor , for a breakfast of sausage , prunes , oatmeal and coffee , and then led back to our cage . In our absence the prison chaplain left a handful of Bible tracts on our cots , forgetting , perhaps , that it was their curious , literal belief in the Bible that caused the Crusaders to oppose war and be dragged off to prison . Is not the chaplain aiding Satan 's seditiousness in passing out such an unpatriotic document ? Is he 145 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " The dash , comrade , represents a glorious interruption . At that point the sergeant who had brought us from Camp Sherman came up the stairs . We had not thought to see him again . " Boys , " he said happily . " Good news ! " We crowded to the barred door . " You are not to stay in Leavenworth . I 've just received orders to take you on the next train to Fort Riley . " Ah , how the stone and the steel seemed to vanish . " Hallelujah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised ! " cried the Crusaders . The sergeant went in search of the turnkey . " A song , boys ! " exclaimed someone . The Crusaders formed a circle . " We 're marching to Zion , Beautiful , beautiful Zion . . . " Their voices echoed again , joyously , triumphantly , in the guardhouse corridors as the turnkey came up rattling his keys , a smile on his kindly face . 1461 FORT RILEY Trial by Military FORT RILEY Trial by Military FORT RILEY , Kansas , September 28 , 1918. - This old army outpost in the Kansas plains is an architectural projection of the military mind . It is rigid , rectangular , cold , and hard as steel . The stone barracks , a score of them , frown on the parade ground , a discouraged patch of sand and grass between the gray buildings . Behind the barracks range officers ' dwellings and long lines of cavalry stables , now dark and deserted . On all sides of this fort the plains roll away to the horizon ; from behind one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and the louder thud of smaller artillery on the firing range , like the strum of a plucked piano wire . The fort , thus isolated in the prairies , draws into itself , moody and irritable . In the new army cantonments there is a certain restlessness and vigor , a stirring about and uncer-149J " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " tainty , but here all elements have congealed into ancient military rituals both of mind and body ? everything is hard and fast , snobbish , cold-blooded and savage . Can you imagine then , comrade , how the pacifist Crusaders fit into this scheme of things ? There are some two hundred of us here ; we are incomprehensible to the military mind and more hated than scorpions . I do not know , but I strongly suspect that it was the amiable intention of the war department to segregate as many war objectors as possible in an army post like this so that we might feel the full pressure of the mailed gauntlet . From the stories I heard to-day I know that the lash has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adventists , Christadelphians , International Bible Students and a dozen other creeds which the Crusaders represent , there are segregated in Fort Riley a different breed that has borne the brunt of the torture : the Socialists , I.W.W. 's and other political heretics . They are not meek , like the religionists ; they do not turn the other cheek . They are upstanding , militant ; they irk the fort commandant more than white-hot 150 FORT RILEY goads , and he has used everything short of murder to break their spirit . . . . But I shall tell you more of that later . My thirteen Christian friends and I arrived here last night from Fort Leavenworth . Our removal from the prison cage came as a deliverance for which we are still singing pxans , and yet only a few hours convinced us that we had only leaped from the fire into the frying pan . However terrible prison may have been , there was yet the one little consolation that we were at the bottom , that things could get no worse , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more clearly defined than it was on my first day in camp two months ago . We slept in a stone barracks populated only by war objectors and guarded by sergeants and a lieutenant who run things with iron discipline . After breakfast this morning we were assembled and marched across the parade ground to the fort headquarters , overlooking a deep valley . The hollow was a rolling carpet of mist . Behind the churning film rattled the machine guns , and when the fog later 151 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " lifted we could see soldiers in skirmish line , and lines of earthwork that concealed the guns . We were lined up in front of the headquarters veranda , where Major Kellogg , a member of the president 's board to try war objectors , was to hold court . The major and his aides arrived and sat around a long table and we were led , singly , before the trial board . It was tedious work . The hours passed . The sun came out and beat down on us hotly while we waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of about thirty from the guardhouse , including a dozen strange , bearded Molokans from a religious colony in Arizona . And soon , under heavy guard , came the Socialists and other radicals from the " tent colony " in the misty valley . I edged over to this group . As the hours wore on discipline was relaxed a little , and I was enabled to speak to them . I met Charles Larson , John Downey , F. X. Hennessey , Earling Lunde , Howard Moore , Morris Franklin and Ulysses de Rosa , and Evan Thomas . Strange stories they whispered to me : of fourteen-day hunger strikes , of collapse and forcible feeding at the hospital , resuscitation and hunger strikes again . This was their answer to the 152 FORT RILEY attempts of the fort to make them military men . The commandant had marched them out into the open field in the hot plains , and had given them tents and raw food but no stove , and had tried to break down their morale by isolation and contempt . They demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silly game , and to bring matters to a head went on the hunger strike . On August 25th , just a month ago , seven of the radicals were removed from the tent colony and put in an iron cage in the basement of the fort guardhouse . Next day three of them , Kaplan , Breger and Hennessey , were taken out of the cage . A rope was tied around their necks , and the other end of the rope was looped through a railing in the upper tier of cells . The three were then hoisted off their feet until they turned purple and were at the point of collapse . The rope was then removed and the men fell to their knees . Then guards brought in a hose , and a stream of icy water was played on them till they became unconscious . They were then carried downstairs and dumped into the cage again , where their comrades unclothed and dried them and nursed them back to life . 1531 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " These were the stories that were whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellogg to dispose of our fates . Back of the tales I could sense the bafflement of the military post which in all its long history , I suppose , had met with no such amazing mutiny that even the guardhouse and the noose could not curb . In their eyes we were maniacal and leprous , and I know that if he were not hampered by regulations , Colonel Waterman , the fort commandant , would have considered it the act of a patriot and gentleman to have us lined in front of the guardhouse wall and shot . I know it because I kept my eyes on the colonel . While we waited for our trials , he walked up and down before our ragged ranks . He was slapping a riding crop against his leather puttees , and every time he looked at us the lids of his eyes drooped , his brows knotted and his face turned a dull brick-red . I am afraid , comrade , the colonel does not love us . One o'clock dragged around . We were still waiting for Major Kellogg to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort headquarters . Less 154 FORT RILEY than half of the three hundred war objectors had been tried . The sun was hot , and our legs were weary . And then the major himself , handsome as a recruiting poster , came down from the porch followed by his staff , six dramatic ramrods . The major ordered us assembled in a great ring on the parched lawn . A disreputable ring we were , slovenly sweating ? dusty sheep huddling under a storm cloud . The dozen whiskered Molokans from Arizona stood dazed as if the lightning had already struck . " Men , " announced the major , " I come here not as your friend , for I do not believe in your ideas . Neither do I come as your enemy . I am here to interpret the law and to answer questions . There has been much trouble in Fort Riley from the activities of some of you , and before going on with the hearings I am giving you a chance to air your grievances . " The religionists stood mute . The Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weakened from a hunger strike , sagged on his bended knees and was prodded in the ribs by the guardhouse sergeant . Then into the ring , from the group 155 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " of Socialists and humanitarians , stepped a boy who looked without fear at the major , the imposing staff , and Colonel Waterman , still viciously swishing his riding crop . " We have been ordered , " said the boy , " to cut grass in various parts of the camp . Some of us consider this non-combatant , military work , as it indirectly aids the war , and we can not perform it . " " Sir , " said the major , " you ca n't draw the line . No matter what you work at while you live in this country you are aiding the war , and when you die you are aiding the war because there is one less mouth to feed . " Another boy stepped forward . " I do n't agree with you , major , " he said . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards or so of our barracks but no further . " Colonel Waterman , whom I expected to see drop any moment from an apoplectic fit , so red with fury was his face , pointed his riding whip at the boy and cried through his teeth : " Bah . You have a ten-yard conscience ! " 156 FORT RILEY And the major added angrily : " You are one of those dangerous men in our camp ? a Socialist , I 'll wager , or an I.W.W. , an obstructionist , a thorn in the flesh of our government . You split hairs . Now , what is your profession ? " " Barber , sir , " replied the thorn in the flesh , with the ghost of a smile . " Then you aided war . " " I do n't see that . " " Did you ever shave a soldier ? " " Yes , sir . " " There you are , then . That soldier might not have been admitted to camp if he had n't been shaved . So you aided war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " announced another boy , stepping from the ranks of the Christian Crusaders , " and I can not stand retreat ' and salute the flag . I read in a book that our flag is our king and our God , ' and the Bible says we shall worship one God only . " " Where did you read that ? " asked the major . " In an army book , a Y.M.C.A. book , I think . " " I do n't believe it . " 157 " HEY ! YELLOWBACKS ! " Then one of the prisoners from the guardhouse stepped up . " A question of law , " he announced . " I refused to do certain work in camp because I considered it military . For punishment I was put in the guardhouse . Yet now I have been asked to do the same work which I have already refused and for which I am imprisoned . Is that just ? " " I ca n't answer that , " replied the major . " However , I believe your colonel is administrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even those who remembered the cage and the tortures in the fort guardhouse ; perhaps the humor of it cut too deeply for laughter . For another half-hour the odd dialogue continued , but did not narrow by a jot the enormous cleft between the military mind and the religious conscience . The major quoted rules and regulations , set down in black and white ; the religious Crusaders consulted some still , small voice within them , powerful for all its vagueness ; the radicals were fortified by class-consciousness and hatred of our imperialist 158 FORT RILEY exploiters ; the humanitarians were strengthened by love ? and all these queer souls , soldier , political heretic and saint , would have gone , and will go , perhaps , to their death rather than yield an inch of their ground . The dialogue was comic , most of it , but remembering the sober potentialities that lay behind it ? death and the dungeon ? its humor became dramatic , and bitter with the savor of tragedy . That is why , perhaps , no one laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda . The hearings were resumed . By and by it came my turn , and I climbed the steps with a corporal at my side and faced the major and the ring of uniforms gathered around a long table . My name was read from a list . " This is your first hearing ? " asked the major . " No , sir . I was tried by Dean Stone at Camp Sherman . " " Have you anything to add ? Will you now accept non-combatant service ? " " No , sir . " " Then , " said the major , a little wearily , " I do n't see the use of a second trial . That will be all . " 159
