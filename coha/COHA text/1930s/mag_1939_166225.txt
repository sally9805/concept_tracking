I 'll be switched <P> The hay ai n't pitched . . . . <P> So git up Napoleon , <P> It looks like rain . <P> Many a farmer has had a conniption trying to get his hay from his fields to his barn before it rains . He has wished that he could put the hay away wet or dry , and that he could store it in a silo the way he does corn fodder . Last week the enterprising Monsanto Chemical Co. of St. Louis told him that he could-if he would just use a new , low-cost , scientific treatment which Monsanto has trademarked as " Phosilage . " <P> Corn fodder can be stored in silos because it has a high content of carbohydrates . Fermentation breaks down the carbohydrates into lactic and acetic acids , which inhibit bacterial action , keep the fodder from rotting . Untreated hay , wet or not , rots in a silo because it is so low in carbohydrate content that the alkaline products of fermentation overcome the effect of the acids . Monsanto 's technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silo and blow " Phosilage " in with it . " Phosilage , " which is 75% phosphoric acid , neutralizes the alkalinity , allows the natural acids to do their preservative work. * Moreover , according to Monsanto , its phosphorus content promotes healthy bones in cattle . <P> <P> *Other treatments for ensilaged hay , which Monsanto claims are not so good as " Phosilage , " are sulphuric and hydrochloric acids , blackstrap molasses .
