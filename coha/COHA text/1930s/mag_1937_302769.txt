By last week virtually everything that could be said about President Roosevelt 's Supreme Court plan had been said , and Congressmen had settled down to a stretch of chewing over the arguments , jockeying for position . Theme of most talk was the chance of a compromise , possibly by Constitutional amendment . Senator Borah introduced a proposal to rewrite the 14th Amendment , define its " due process " clause as applying only to governmental procedure , thus ' giving States free rein for social and economic experiments . Nobody expected that to satisfy Federalist Franklin Roosevelt . Some optimists still hoped that the whole issue might be dodged by means of the Sumners-McCarran bill , permitting Supreme Court Justices to retire at 70 on full pay ( TIME , Feb. 22 ) , which the Senate last week passed by 76-10-4 , and the President promptly signed . <P> High point of a dull week in the Court battle came when Baltimore 's Catholic Review , official newsorgan of blunt Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley , pitched into Catholic University 's liberal Monsignor John Augustine Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a Fascist , dictatorial mind , " roared the archiepiscopal spokesman . " He wants sycophants and cowards ( not all of them in Congress are sycophants and cowards ) to give President Roosevelt power not only to control the Supreme Court of the United States in his own Administration but until the Crack of Doom . Stalin , Mussolini , Hitler and Largo Caballero , Monsignor Ryan , would make pikers of you . "
