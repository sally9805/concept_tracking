txt Rapid transit unification negotiations with the B. M. T. are deadlocked over a difference of $11,900,000 in the purchase price , but prospects for a final agreement with the Interborough are regarded as excellent , Samuel Untermyer , special counsel for the Transit Commission . declared yesterday in a report submitted to that board together with a revision of the unification plan which he prepared last December . The report reveals that the B. M. T. is not only insisting upon an additional $7,000,000 to meet outstanding claims , judgments and tax arrears , but is claiming another $4,900 , - 000 on account of improvements and extensions . Mr. Untermyer stamps the demand " as not only unreasonable but unthinkable " and intimates that the company 's attitude is due to its belief- that the city 's need of either finding an operator for the new Enghth Avenue subway at once or embarking upon municipal operation makes it possible to exact whatever terms it sees fit . Declaring that the company probably will spend about $500,000 less for maintenance this year than in 1931 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth no more than they were six months ago . Sets Price at $489,878,000 . The revised plan , which calls for acquisition of the combined B. M. T. and Interborough rapid transit properties at a gross price of $489,678,000 , and their operation under a Board of Transit Control , makes several material changes in the scheme submitted last December . The Transit Commission adopted a resolution accepting the revised plan as the basis for public hearings to begin on Monday at its office at 270 Madison Avenue . The official valuations of company properties , prepared by the Transit Commission 's accounting staff , will be available on Monday and will be incorporated in the plan . The opening hearing will be devoted to the entry of appearances by those who desire to be heard for or against the plan . A short adjournment then will be taken , William G. Fullen , chairman of the Transit Commission , said , to permit a study of the plan and the valuations by those interested . The commission has invited the companies and the Board of Transportation to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business groups and to individuals . The gross prices set in the revised plan are substantially the same as those in the December draft , the figures being a bit lower because of amortizations of funded debt and other deductions made since June 30 , 1930 . The new prices are based on the fiscal conditions of the companies as of March 31 , 1931 . As compared with the prices in the December plan , they are as follows : Revised December Plan . Plan . Interborough $195,285,000 $195,332,000 Manhattan Raijway. 81,172.000 81,172,000 B. M. T. 213,218,000 213,300,000 Totals $489,678,000 $489,804,000 Proposes Subway Subsidiary . The revised plan , like that of last December , contemplates the assumption of all bonded debt of the Interborough and B. M. T. elevated lines and the retirement of the other securities of the companies by the issue of about $200,000,000 of 414 per cent Board of Transit Control bonds , about $162,000,000 of city corporate stock and $61,593,000 of 6 per cent ten-year Board of Transit Control debentures . Like the December plan , the revised draft proposes that the new city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Transit Control with a separate accounting system . The 5-cent fare is made the basis of the entire unification plan as to both city and company properties . Mr. Untermyer 's report , which he describes as a postscript to that which accompanied the December draft , reiterates his belief that the proposed purchase price is from $20 , - 000,000 to $25,000,000 more than the properties are worth in the hands of the companies , but is justified because the city will save $411,411,000 during the remaining term of the dual subway contracts if they are now abrogated . The present worth of that saving he places at $59 , - 953,000 . Changes in Plan Listed . Mr. Untermyer 's latest report points out the following material differences between the revised plan and the December draft : The surplus over fixed charges is reduced to meet changed traffic conditions , but remains sufficient for the purposes of the unification plan . The new plan provides for taking over the Interborough if only 90 per cent of the $136,000,000 of first mortgage bonds are deposited in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a collateral trust mortgage . The new plan requires separate listing and inventory of all company property which is excluded from the plan . ' The report explains that this change is made because of the B. M. T. 's refusal to permit inspection of its books on the ground that it is a holding comp. pany not subject to Transit Corn . mission jurisdiction . Admitting this , Mr. Untermyer declares that it would be " inexcusable " for the Transit Commission to recommend the purchase of B. M. T. properties without access to its financial records . The new proposal retains the ' management contract feature of the old draft , but makes it a thing apart from the plan itself . A new ? element is the right by the Board of Transit Control to terminate the contract on sixty days ' notice after the $61,953,000 of debentures issued to the B. M. T. common stock has been retired . Still another change gives to the Board of Control the option to issue city corporate stock to retire these debentures , thus freeing for budget use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve Years . The report refers to the current de- : cline in company passenger traffic ) and revenues as the reason for a sub . stantial downward revision of esti+ mates of revenue under unified op .. eration . It now finds that it will , take twelve years instead of eleven . to retire the new city debt incurred by issuing $162,000,000 of corporate , stock ; that surplus net income over fixed charges will be materially low- : er than originally estimated ; and , that the sum applicable to principal , interest and sinking fund of the ' city 's " frozen credit ' of $386,000,000 ' in existing lines , beginning with the twelfth year of operation , will bs substantially less than at first con+ templated.
