In the mind of many a famous man lurks the question of what figure he will cut in History . That was the concern of the last bitter years of Napoleon ; it worried vain Frederick the Great ; it troubled Lincoln . Franklin Roosevelt , who has long had an eye on his own place in history , last week made plans to occupy it . <P> Into the oval study on the second floor of the White House trooped the Washington press corps , in response to a summons promising them " the greatest human interest story " in the six years of the Roosevelt Presidency . There they found Franklin Roosevelt , beaming but serious . He had just been host to an impressive array of luncheon guests : Historians Charles A. Beard , Frederic L. Paxson , William E. Dodd . Samuel Eliot Morison ; President Frank Porter Graham of the University of North Carolina and President Edmund Ezra Day of Cornell ; Economist Stuart Chase and Poet Archibald MacLeish ; Mr. Roosevelt 's biographer , Ernest Lindley , and his literary handy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the National Emergency Council ; and the Archivist of the United States , Robert Digges Wimberly Connor ; Presidential Friend Felix Frankfurter . <P> Without further ado the President handed out a statement : <P> " Since 1910 ... I have carefully preserved all of my correspondence , public papers , pamphlets , books , etc . ... It is my desire that they be kept as a whole and intact in their original condition , available to scholars of the future in one definite locality . . . . <P> " That part of my family 's country place at Hyde Park on which we live will , without doubt , eventually go to the Federal Government to be maintained for the benefit of the public by the Federal Government . It is , therefore , my thought that funds can be raised for the erection of a separate , modern , fireproof building . . . . <P> " All of this has the approval and consent of my Mother , who owns the property during her lifetime . . . . " <P> His guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for his plan , taking as their first contribution Mr. Roosevelt 's earnings on his already published papers . A historical precedent will be set : Franklin Roosevelt 's home becomes Government property . The homes of such predecessors as Washington , Jefferson , Jackson and Lincoln are all maintained by private organizations . The Roosevelt history trove will include the President 's books and pictures on the Navy ( best private collection in the U. S. ) and a sizable collection on the history of Hyde Park and Dutchess County . Chief lacuna in the Roosevelt record for posterity : a diary . The President has started one on three January firsts , never kept going later than January 4 . <P> &gt;The President conferred with his Senatorial lieutenant , Jimmy Byrnes , about plans to revive Reorganization next session , indicated that he would probably take Senator Byrnes 's advice to adopt the line of least resistance by splitting the measure into several Congressional bills . <P> &gt; " I am grateful for myself and for a great many future Presidents , " said Franklin Roosevelt as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs carved like eagles to replace the gold monstrosity that has stood in the East Room since 1903.
