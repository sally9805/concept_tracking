txt // removed from the picture of the atom , and the softer tones filled in . The result has been a new quantum mechanics which , in rather strange language , describes the law of the atomic world . We are in this third act now ; its story is being written from week to week in the scientific magazines . The three acts deal with preparation , conquest , and fruition ; we may call them the periods of Planck and of Bohr and of the younger physicists . These names typify the major motifs of these periods . But other motifs are there . There is the Einstein motif . In the middle of the first act of our drama the special theory of relativity entered the stage , and the general theory entered in the second act , and now in our third act the far harder task of complete generalization of the theory to embrace all physics and the problems of cosmology face us ? with what result only the future can say . And then there is the steady development of radioactivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atom has been carried on . With all of this nuclear investigation the name of Rutherford has been associated . In 1899 just after the discovery of radium , Rutherford discovered the alpha and beta rays , then Rutherford and his coworkers discovered the transmutation of the heavier elements and discovered isotopes and ( preparing the way for Bohr ) discovered the nucleus and then artificial nuclear disintegration and now , even as this is being written , comes word of artificial synthesis of nuclei and of the discovery of neutrons ! Nuclear dimensions are to atomic dimensions much as atomic dimensions are to those of our touch-see-hear world . And in this nuclear world a unique kind of physical law must rule . Rather removed from the thoughts of most physicists was this physics of the nucleus . The nucleus is to furnish the riddle of tomorrow . CHAPTER XIII THE QUANTUM OF ACTION Equipartition among ether waves ; but the short waves do not get their share of energy they are too greedy . " Chunks " of energy . The photoelectric effect and specific heat attest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twentieth century . Max Planck published his first formulation of the theory in December , 1900 . A daring , revolutionary concept was this which he gave to the scientists of the new century . The Quantum of Action. ? By action is meant , the product of momentum by distance . If a 2-gm. ball moves 3 ctn. per second , its momentum is 6 units ; after it has traversed ( in the first second ) 3 cm. , its action is 18 , after 6 cm. 36 c.g.s. units , etc . I f a hydrogen atom in a molecule oscillates with an average speed of 2 km. per second , it has ( as a mean ) 2 atomic units of momentum . If the range of the oscillation is 1 angstrom , the vibrator has for each complete ( to and fro ) vibration an action of 4 atomic units . Action is momentum times distance . Now if an atom is free to vibrate or if a pendulum is free to swing or if I choose to pace back and forth , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed or upon the : amplitude of this periodic motion . For me it seems obviously a matter of my choosing ; for the atom the vibration would presumably depend upon the chance blow from another atom which it it in motion . But all this is not entirely so . It would Mil , ear that all amplitudes of periodic motion are in fact not permissible in nature . Indeed for any such repetitive motion as these 1 lie motion must be such that the action in one oscillation is just .1 atomic units or a multiple thereof . The atom can vibrate with 4 orr 8 or 12 or 16 units of action , etc. , and in no other ways . Similarly for a large pendulum , the action must be n it hUie number ( billions of billions of billions in this case ) of this fundnnienfnl element of action ; in this case this restriction to a whole number is no real restriction . 151 // This 4 atomic units ' ( or 6.55 X 10-27 c.g.s. units ) is called Planck 's quantum of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nh ( 14 ) Chunks of Energy. ? In the special case of simple oscillatory motion ( and only in this case ) we may equivalently define the action as the energy times the time the energy ( W ) times the period ( T ) for the action of a single cycle . The quantum restriction which we have just stated is WT=nh where n represents an integer ; or in terms of the frequency This means that the atom must vibrate with an energy just equal to hv , or 2hv , or 3hv , or that the pendulum must swing with an energy of some uncountable number of billions of hv ; the energy of any oscillator must occur as exact multiple of the fundamental energy quantum hv. by appears to be the " atom " of energy , the unsplittable ultimate . An " atom of energy , " surely a strange-sounding theory this ! Today this quantization of energy seems to be forced upon us by experiment in every field of physics . In many cases the implications of the experiment are so direct that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have first discovered the law in some rather involved applications of the laws of chance to radiation from heated bodies . Black-body Radiation ? Total Emission. ? A good absorber of light is a good radiator ; the perfect absorber and the best radiator is a black body . Regardless of material the perfect black body absorbs all the radiant energy falling on it ; regardless of material , every perfect black body emits at the same temperature exactly the same energy , both in quality ( color ) and in amount . Because of these facts the radiation from black bodies has been extensively studied both by the experimental and by the mathematical physicist . But , as it happened , for a while the experimenter awl theorist could not agree . In the first place Stefan ( 1469 ) showed how the emission the total of all colors ) from a heated black body depended on // the temperature . We are all familiar with the rapid increase of radiation with rising temperature ; as the stove approaches red heat , its emission increases greatly . A white-hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts of energy . Stefan found that the emission was proportional to the fourth power of the temperature . In this instance the theorist ( Boltzmann ) was able to predict this same result . The law is known as the StefanBoltzmann law . when the temperature is raised , 47. - Black- body radiation . the body becomes first red hot , ( Visible region hatched . ) I lien red-yellow hot , and finally ( when it emits all colors ) we call it , white hot . The distribution of the emission among the different parts of 1 he spectrum is shown in Fig. 47 for several different temperaI tires . The wave lengths are given in angstroms . The visible region lies between 4000 and 7500 angstroms . The greater part of I he emission is for any available temperature in the infra-red . As the temperature rises , the curve as a whole rises rapidly , some the total emission ( its area ) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ; but at the same time the curve shiftsI lie visible . At 1000 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beginning to show and the maximum is at a wave length of 3000 angstroms ; at 21 ) 10 " abs. ( incandescent-lamp temperature ) E=W/t=o-T4 ( 15 ) where a- = 5.7 X 10 ? 5c.g.s. units and is called Stefan 's constant . ( This is for unit area of surface . ) The sun is about 6000 ? abs. , a tungsten lamp about 2000 ? ; hence per equal area the sun emits 34 ( or eighty-one ) times as much as the lamp . ( These are not black bodies but the law applies approximately . ) " Red Hot and White Hot . " ? The quality of the emission as well as its quantity varies ; at low figure // the maximum is at 15,000 angstoms and at 6000 ? abs. ( solar temperature ) at 5000 angstroms . The same thing can be stated in terms of frequency . At 1000 ? abs. the ether waves are vibrating in many modes , faster and slower , but the most intense vibration has a frequency of 300,000/30,000 or 10 vibrations per subsecond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations per subsecond . Raise it sixfold to the temperature of the sun and the maximum falls in the visible ( green ) at 60 vibrations per subsecond . This is the substance of Wien 's displacement law : with rising temperature the emission curve shifts over to higher frequencies ; corresponding frequencies are proportional to the temperature . The first careful emissivity measurements were made by Lummer and Pringsheim in 1899 . Energy Partition in the Ether. ? Now all of this perhaps seems commonplace enough to you and me , but to the mathematical physicist it seemed very amazing . Thinking in terms of the laws of chance , of equipartition of energy , of increase in entropy , he felt that most of this radiant energy should appear not here in the infra-red but in shortest conceivable wave lengths . His reasoning was interesting . The type of black body which is always used in these radiation measurements is a hollow box with a hole in it . This hole is , of course , the perfect absorber . This box serves as a quiet pool of ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heated walls , should soon establish equilibrium conditions . We may liken it to a pool of water . If we throw a rock into the water pool , large waves are sent out ; these large waves are reflected , break up into smaller waves , the smaller waves into ripples , and 1 he ripples become smaller and smaller and smaller until finally the energy is localized in that undirected molecular motion which we call heat . The law of equipartition of energy can be applied to waves . It states that , in the ultimate equilibrium , the energy t o be found in waves of each different possible wave length must he equal . Each different wave acts as a degree of freedom . This pool of water ( or of ether ) can vibrate as one " loop " or can have a node in the middle , or two or three ; it may have a countless variety of small waves , only a few large ones . The vibrations resemble the standing waves in a string . A string ; r meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // than 1 cm. ? how infinitely many modes of shorter wave length ! The energy for each mode of vibration is to be the same , no more in the single longest wave than in any single one of the countless short ones . Therefore practically all of the energy must appear in the infinite numbers of infinitesimal ripples . In water or in any other material body this process of breaking up into smaller and smaller waves must stop when we reach atomic dimensions . Surely a wave of atoms shorter than the distances between atoms can not be ; there is nothing there to wave . In the ether there is no such limitation . Wien and Lord Rayleigh and Planck and the others expected from their analysis of black-body radiation that , if long red rays were present , these would break up into violet rays , twice as many types of violet waves , twice as much energy . And then into still more kinds of ultra-violet waves , still more energy . And thousands of more modes of vibrations in the x-rays , and Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed this reasoning led to an infinite number of waves shorter than the shortest observable wave and all the radiant energy in that region . Actually in this range there is no energy ; except at the highest temperature the energy maximum is in the infra-red . Now a mathematical physicist does not like to admit that he does not know what he is talking about . He starts with some facts , pins these facts down with numbers , and then follows where those numbers lead him ? such is the logic of mathematics . And if the result is in error , it must be that his assumed facts were not facts . Now the chief " fact " that Rayleigh put into his reasoning machine was this : Any kind of ether wave is possible , of any wave length , of any intensity . Could this be wrong ? Could it be that the ether , like matter , is granular , atomic in structure , giving a lower limit to waves ? Could there he here , as in material waves , some constraint upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose that Planck , in looking over his work , did as any of us would do when we have made a mistake and have failed to get what we know to be the right answer ; I suppose that he worked from both ends of the problem . These observed curves for distribution of energy in different wave lengths look something like Maxwell 's distribution curves for molecules and the equation may be expressed in about the same form . Actually the function // which is similar ( except for the -1 ) to M-B distribution function , fitted the experimental results very well . Then Planck tried his laws of chance again . This time he worked as follows : Suppose that the radiant energy in the black-body box is divided into small elements each of size E. We can let this energy element be as small as we please ; it may approach zero in size , to agree with the usual idea that energy is continuous , infinitely fine grained . We can see in how many ways these energy elements can be shared among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the crank of the statistical machine ? and it led Planck to the conclusion that the energy should be distributed as And then , just as he was about to do the sensible thing and let E approach zero , which would have led to the old wrong result , he stopped . If this E , the smallest element of radiant energy , is proportional to the frequency v , then the statistician 's result will agree perfectly with nature . And Planck made this assumption ? not a very " sensible " assumption I am afraid but it happened to be right . Energy is radiated in chunks ? quanta. where h is 6.55 X 10-27 erg-sec . In atomic units h is 3.97 . We shall usually use the approximate value 4 . Planck 's formula for black-body radiation agrees with the observation perfectly , i.e. , within the error of the experiment . Quanta. - This was revolutionary . Of course , it was not generally accepted for a number of years . The idea is that there is a minimum quantity of energy just as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are 92 species of atoms , each with its atomic weight ; there are an indefinite number of sizes of energy quanta , one for every different frequency , the " quantum weight " ( so to speak ) being proportional to the frequency . There is an atomicity in electricity . Your electric-power company can furnish you practically any amount . of electricity ; it can not split a charge of 1.6 X IU ' " coulomb . A radio station // can send out practically any quantity of radiant energy but , supposing that it is operating at a million cycles per second ( 10- ' cycles per subsecond ) , it can not radiate less than 4 X 10- ' atomic erg of energy . This is the sense of the new theory . Of course , for such low frequencies as those used in radio the quanta are too small to be significant . The energy for radio waves is very finely pulverized indeed ; for visible light the granular structure of energy becomes significant , perhaps we may compare it with grains of sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in x-rays is as great rocks whose quantum nature can not possibly be overlooked . In atomic units Planck 's constant is approximately 4 . Yellow light ( 6000 angstroms ) has a frequency of 50 vibrations per subsecond . Its quanta are 200 atomic ergs , about 2 c-volts in size . For red light the quanta are in the neighborhood of 170 atomic ergs , for green 220 atomic ergs , blue 240 , violet up to 300 ; for x-rays of 1 angstrom length v is 300,000 and the quantum is 1,200,000 ; for short gamma rays the quantum of energy is over 100 million units ( over a million e-volts ) . We may compare these large quanta with the energy of the average monatomic molecule at ordinary temperature . At 300 ? abs . ' KT is about 4 atomic ergs ? no wonder visible radiation is not emitted from a solid at this temperature , no wonder the emission of radiant energy is in the infra-red . Even at 1200 ? abs. when red light is being emitted the mean energy , potential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 atomic ergs , about ( one-tenth of that making up the quantum of red light . Where Degrees of Freedom Cease to Function. ? The blackhod ) / radiation curve drops off at high frequencies because n these frequencies the energy quanta are individually so great t hit f t here is very little probability of such amounts of energy living available for a single degree of freedom . This is especially true it lower temperatures . The mean energy-wealth of the community is too small . ( The 10-ct. store does more business than the store with exclusive prices in a nonexclusive neighborhood. ) - rays do not come in for their share in the equipartition of radiant energy because they are too greedy ? asking for too large quanta they get none . Here is a limitation to the equipartition of energy . Ninny HI her similar instances will appear . Vibrating atoms in t he molecule or in it solid , or revolving electrons in the // atom , whatever the mechanism whenever the frequency is too high the degree of freedom , demanding its extravagantly large quanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in very " wealthy communities " ( i.e. , at high temperatures ) . Photons. ? This theory of Planck 's was not received exactly with open arms . Most physicists felt it were better to leave black-body radiation unexplained than to pull down the whole wave theory of light . Planck tried to soothe these fears of the conservatives . He insisted that radiant energy was emitted as quanta but ( said he ) this does not necessarily mean that light consists of particles . It means only that a certain number of the light waves , or , more exactly , waves totaling a certain definite energy , must be emitted as a unit . The wave theory was preserved but there was a certain restriction placed on the amount of vibrating energy . Einstein accepted Planck 's theory and indeed went a step further : he supposed light to consist of particles , photons as they came to be called . So after two hundred years the old theory of Newton came back on the stage . Strange that Newton 's optics was called back by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics and in the same year 1905 . Einstein applied the theory to the photoelectric effect . Theory of Photoelectric Effect . Einstein 's theory of the photoelectric effect was as simple and direct as Planck 's theory of radiation was complicated . Said Einstein : when light falls , photon by photon , on a piece of metal , these photons will , if their energy ( hv ) is sufficient , cause electrons to be emitted . For an electron to leave a surface in this fashion requires a certain amount of work ; this is indeed the latent heat of evaporation of an electron ( Wo ) ; any further energy will appear after evaporation as kinetic energy ( equation ) . Hence when the quantum of energy is delivered to an electron , we have This is Einstein 's photoelectric equation . It might seem reasonable that more intense light would produce electrons withgreater velocity . Einstein said no , velocity depends on I he color of the absorbed light . After allowing for the energy of aporization ( 61 ' 11 ) t he square of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exciting light . // Nine years later this equation was strikingly verified by Millikan . The greatest care was necessary to have absolutely clean surfaces ; others had distilled metals in a vacuum and tested the photoelectric effect of surfaces which have never been in contact with the air ; Millikan devised a machine which would cut fresh surfaces of sodium , potassium , etc. , inside the vacuum chamber ? " the machine shop in a 320 vacuum " it came to be called . As 300 a result of these experiments Millikan indeed that the energy ( equation ) did ndeed ( except for the constant Wo ) vary directly as the frequency . And the constant of proportionality was Heat of Vaporization of Electrons. ? Each metal has its own characteristic heat of vaporization o ( work function ) of electrons Wo and hence each has a critical frequency limit below which electron emission can not occur . Electrons are most readily removed from the alkalis . For caesium the value of Wo is about 180 atomic ergs ' and hence the threshold frequency is 45 vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( red ) . When such light falls on the metal , the electron barely escapes with zero speed . If green light or violet light or ultra-violet or x-rays fall upon the metal , I he ejected electron has velocity proportional to the square root of the excess of the frequency over the threshold value . Consider again the remarkable way in which this photoelectric effect acts . If into a pool of water a plank is dropped , wave goes outward , extending and growing less and less intense i goes . Surely we should not expect all the energy of this wave to act upon some other distant plank floating on the water : Ind throw it upward to a height equal to that from which the first blank fell . Rather we should expect dissipation of energy . lint ( Allen an electron is suddenly stopped and hence emits // radiation , it sends out into the pool of " ether " a wave which acts in its entirety upon some single other electron , possibly 90 million miles away , giving to this latter a speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that Einstein felt doubtful about this wave picture , felt the need of a " photon . " Rubidium finds its threshold for the photoelectric effect in the yellow , potassium in the green , and sodium in the blue . The nonalkalis require ultra-violet light for photoelectric emission . For platinum Wo is 500 atomic ergs ( see Table 19 ) and the threshold frequency is 125 vibrations per subsecond . Alkalis are the prime electron losers of all the elements ; they are the formers of positive ions par excellence . The photoelectric effect gives an independent method of measuring the heat of vaporization of the electron . The agreement between these values of the work function Wo and the values obtained from thermionics is conclusive evidence of the soundness of the theory . Now this theory of Einstein 's was predicated on the assumption that light is absorbed in quanta , of value hv . ( Planck had required only emission by quanta . ) If a single quantum of light as emitted spreads out in all directions as an expanding wave , how can that energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quandary for Einstein and he advocated the corpuscular theory of light . At the time few followed him to this conclusion . The photoelectric effect at all events certainly confirmed conclusively the fundamental quantum hypothesis . But by 1914 , when the conclusive experiment of Millikan was performed , the quantum theory was already generally accepted . . Specific Heats at Low Temperature . In the decade after it s pronouncement the new theory of Planck received two confirmations . One has just been mentioned ; the other also originated wtih Einstein and the theory wits developed in improved form // by Debye . We have seen ( page 63 ) that in most cases the atomic heats of solid elements are approximately 6 . Several light elements have anomalous values . For example , the atomic heat of carbon as diamond is 1.5 and as graphite is 2.0 . But these unduly low atomic heats increase as the temperature is raised ; the atomic heat of diamond is 5.3 at 600 ? C. And , on the other hand , every substance becomes " anomalous " at sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the heaviest elements ) is 2.5 at the temperature of liquid hydrogen ( ? 253 ? C. ) . Such anomalies were quite inexplicable on the basis of simple equipartition of energy . The quantum theory suggested a solution . Einstein and Debye remarked that light atoms would have high natural frequencies of vibration in the crystal ; hence the quantum of vibrational energy would be large and hence , as they demonstrated , this mode of vibration frequently excited low temperature . For instance , in diamond the highest natural vibration frequency is .1 vibrations per second with I a corresponding element of energy ( he ) of 16 atomic ergs ; on the other hand , the heavy lead atom vibrates only once in 5 soh see . ( v = 0.2 ) and the energy quantum is 0.8 atomic erg . I. ; vidently at ordinary temperature where the mean energy per oscillator is 71 ( ; Ill oleic ergs , ' the average lead atom will have nearly 10 quanta of energy , some more , some less . The diamond // atoms , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get none . Einstein assumed that each crystal had but a single frequency , that of the individual atom vibrating under the influence of its binding forces ; Debye recognized that groups of atoms could also vibrate as a unit giving many lower frequencies . Einstein 's original theory was quite successful ; Debye 's theory agreed almost exactly with the experimental values . The theory ties together with great exactness the specific heats , the hardness , the melting points . ( For the effect of hardness compare diamond and graphite or silicon and sodium . ) The natural vibrational frequencies , of course , depend upon the lightness of the atom and the stiffness of the binding forces . The Limitation of Equipartition. ? At low temperatures certain degrees of freedom of highest frequency are lost to the statistical equilibrium of the solid . This is a most consequential idea . In the old kinetic theory each atom was thought of as a rigid ball . Although from its spectrum its interior structure seemed to be " more complicated than a grand piano , " as it played its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single rigid particle . Why did not the electrons and protons in the interior , each key and string of the " grand piano , " come in for its share of energy ? When two hydrogen atoms are united as a molecule , the molecule can rotate ; why not vibrate ? Why this rigid protection of the interior of atoms and molecules from the vicissitudes of collisions ? The answer we find in the quantum theory . The frequencies of electron rotation in the atom , of atomic vibrations in the molecule , are too high ; the energy quantum is too great ; these degrees of freedom are not excited at ordinary temperatures . In the molecular world there is the law of equipartition of energy . But this partitioning does not go so far that each atom within the molecule , each electron or proton within the atom , can claim its share of the energy . It is the quantum theory which puts a limit to this dividing and subdividing of energy . It is the quantum theory which makes the molecule the natural unit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory was applied 10 these three fundamental problems problems iii three divergent fields , one in radiation , one in photoelectricity , one in specific heals . In each case it led to an exact solution of the prohlemi. // Such problems did not occupy the center of the stage , however , and the young theory was generally ignored . But when , two years later , Bohr used the theory to elucidate the nature of the atom and the significance of spectra , the case was different . Then the quantum theory achieved its true position as one of the most fundamental of physical laws . CHAPTER XIV SPECTRUM SERIES We meet spectra : absorption and emission , line and band , principal and sharp , singlet and triplet ; the Balmer series , red , blue , violet , and on into the ultra-violet ? and other hydrogen spectra ? and spectra from other elements all cut to the same pattern . Facts and relations in this chapter but none of the " reasons why . " The spectrum is the language of the atom . Newton broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of the solar spectrum . In 1859 Kirchhoff and Bunsen laid the foundations of spectrometric chemical analysis . ' A few years later Balmer discovered the series which is associated with his name . By the close of the century a great collection of spectroscopic data was available . This is summarized in 5000 pages in Kayser 's " Handbook of Spectroscopy . " These accumulated data were the words of the atom but until Bohr 's time they lacked an interpreter . Bohr 's theory was the Rosetta stone for the atomic world . With that theory a new period , the golden age of spectroscopy , began . Vast accretion of fundamental spectroscopic lore went hand in hand with interpretation . Within ten years even the more complicated spectra of iron and of manganese , etc. , were being successfully analyzed . Spectrum Types. ? The reader should have some familiarity with spectra . It is to be hoped that he has had the opportunity to see for himself several types of visible spectra absorption , emission , line , band , continuous , etc . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction let us look at a few types of spectra as illustrated in the " Encyclopaedia Britannica . " ( This reference will certainly be accessible to all . ) Plate 1 ( " Encyclopaedia Britannica , " Vol. 21 , p. 182 ) shows spectrograms , natural size , as taken with a large quartz spectre-1 // graph . Panchromatic films were used . These films are evidently sensitive well up into red at 6800 angstroms ? rather less sensitive in the green in the neighborhood of 5000 angstroms . ' The visible portion of the spectrum extends down to 4000 angstroms . The thousands of lines in the iron arc are shown in the lower spectrograms . They extend down to about 2250 angstroms . The quartz prism and lenses of the spectrograph begin to absorb the light in this region ; quartz becomes quite opaque for wave lengths below 1800 angstroms . The upper set of spectrograms shows the absorption characteristics of several kinds of glasses . Vita glass transmits very well down to 2700 angstroms . Crown and flint glass show marked differences . Wood 's remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opaque throughout the visible but transparent to the near ultra-violet . The second series of spectrograms shows the solar spectrum , extending down to about 3100 angstroms ; some absorption lines : ire seen , not very clearly in the visible . Plate II shows characteristic types of spectra . Figures 2 and 4 are absorption spectra ; others are emission spectra . Of all spectra the simplest is that of the hydrogen atom . Figure 6 shows the first six lines of this spectrum : H , , in the red , Hs in the blue , H , and Ha in the violet . Beyond the last line shown here others can be found , coming closer and closer ( ) get her in regular progression , giving the " Balmer series . " A beautiful example of another similar series extending to over 20 lines is found in the " principal series " of potassium ( 2h ) . Only the first line of this series is in the visible part of the spectrum . The plate represents an absorption spectrum . ( In 2a is shown a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the note on page 111 . ) Gaseous spectra are either of the line or of the band type . The spectrograms la and lb show the line spectrum and the lid spectrum of nitrogen . Line spectra are characteristic of monoatomic molecules ; here it is obtained from dissociated nitrogen molecules . The bands are in reality composed of many close lines , and such spectra are obtained from diatomic or polyatomic molecules . The discussion of band spectra will be post pined t o Chap . X XI II . // The spectra obtained at low voltage and high voltage ( as in the metal are and in the spark , respectively ) are rather different . Figure 3 illustrates this . Spectrogram 3b is due to the excitation of a single electron in the atom . The additional lines appearing in 3a ( " spark lines " ) are due to the excitation of two or more electrons in the atom , which can take place only at higher voltage . Very simple series were shown in 2b and 6 . Usually the series are more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of series may exist and the lines of these different series may overlap . In 2b was shown the principal series ( absorption ) of potassium . Spectrograms 8 and 9 show similar series ( but in this case for emission lines ) for other alkalis . The red color of the lithium flame and the yellow color of sodium flame are due to the first lines of the principal series . ( These were not panchromatic plates and the first lines of the principal series do not appear on the spectrograms shown in Plate II . ) For sodium the wave length of the first line is 5890 ( 5896 ) angstroms followed by 3302 , 2852 , 2680 , etc. , the series approaching a limit at 2513 angstroms . But there is also a " sharp series " ( 5152 , 4752 , 4546 angstroms , etc. ) and a " diffuse series " ( 4983 , 4669 , 4500 angstroms , etc . ) . ( The other lines shown in these spectrograms are due to impurities , chiefly air . ) Not only do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , diffuse , etc. , instead of one , but also each individual line of the series usually is broken up into a multiplet . Although it can not be seen on these spectrograms , each of these lines in the lithium and sodium and potassium spectra is in reality a doublet . The first member of the principal series of sodium is not one line but two , differing 0.1 per cent in wave length ( 5890 and 5896 angstroms ) . The separation in multiplet components is much greater in zinc ( Fig. 10 ) , and it is even greater in cadmium ( which is present in Fig. 10 as impurity ) . Here the lines are triplets rather than doublets . The sharp ( S ) and diffuse ( D ) series of triplets are shown running from the visible far down into the ultra-violet , five members of each series . These are samples of the very simplest spectra . Multiplets of much greater complexity sometimes occur . Such a multiplet // of iron with 15 components is shown in 7 . This high multiplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fig. 4 the great number of lines in a very small part of the iron spectrum . Notice that Figs. 4 and 7 are on much larger scales than the other spectrograms ( compare with Plate I , where the region 4400 to 4500 angstroms extends but an eighth of an inch ) . The iron spectrum , so rich in lines , is often used for comparison , as a secondary standard , to compare other wave lengths ( Fig. 5 ) . This has been a hurried survey over the field . These spectra must be directly perceived in all their prismatic beauty ; t here is something satisfying to the eye in seeing these purest of colors . And as we contemplate the meaning of all of these radio messages from the atomic world , our imagination and curiosity are piqued . There must be a great story behind all of this . Wave Length and Frequency . The wave length ( X ) is usually expressed in angstroms . The frequency ( v ) is given by v = c/X . In using normal units c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length must be reduced to centimeters . The frequency of yellow light ( X = 6000 angstroms ) is figure In atomic units the frequency is a conveniently small number t he velocity of light in these units is 300,000 . This divided by he wave length in angstroms gives the vibrations per subsecond . Red light has a frequency of approximately 40 ( i.e. , 300,000 7500 ) ; yellow light , 50 ; the shortest visible violet light , 75 vi brat ions per subsecond . In the succeeding chapters , as we try to unravel the meaning of 1 he atom , we must be continually discussing frequencies he number of revolutions of an electron or vibration of a molecule or alternations of a light wave in a subsecond . We have noted how comparatively infrequently come the collisions between gas molecules ( about one in a thousand subseconds under S. ( . ) ; we have seen how the diatomic molecules ( Table 6 ) usually take some 5 or 10 subset . for a rotation . Now we deal faster alternations- from 40 to 75 cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still higher , into the ths:Inds and millions . // A very little has been selected for illustration from the vast body of spectroscopic data ; even this little can be confusing at a first reading . Out of it must come a realization of relative frequencies and the laws governing frequencies . And for any frequency of radiation , the quantum of energy is ( approximately ) 4v . The Best Known Hydrogen Series. ? Figure 50 shows the Balmer lines of hydrogen as observed in the spectrum of a star . In Table 22 are given the wave lengths and frequencies of the spectrum of hydrogen which is found in the visible and near visible . The lowest frequency is 45.7 vibrations per subsecond ( the red line ) . This , with the three following lines , constitute the visible spectrum . More than 20 additional lines have been observed , coming nearer and nearer together and approaching a limit of 82.2 vibrations per subsecond . Now , it will be noticed that the frequency of the first line is exactly five-ninths of the limiting frequency , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next twenty-one twentyfifths of the limit , and so on . The denominators of these fractions are the natural squares ( 9 , 16 , etc. ) and the numerators four less . Balmer ( 1885 ) observed This simple relation and gave 1111 ' True series relationship ; the series has Keen given Iris mimic . // The simplest way of expressing the frequencies of this Balmer series is v=R ( 4 1 ) where the value of R is 329 and n is any integer larger than 2 . This is the Balmer formula ; the constant R is called the Rydberg constant . Taking n = 3 , we get v = 329 ( ; i ? ; 6 ) = 45.7 , the frequency of the first line of the series ; the next has a frequency of 329 ( r4 ? 1/i6 ) , etc . As n is made larger and larger , the second fraction becomes smaller and smaller and the frequency approaches as a limit 329 X = 82.2 vibrations per second . A Far Ultra-violet Spectrum. ? It was many years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take spectrograms for wave lengths as short as a thousand angstroms . The name of Lyman ( of Harvard University ) is associated with this work in the far ultra-violet . He discovered in this region a new spectrum of hydrogen with a limiting frequency exactly four tiems that of of the Balmer series . The frequencies of the new series are given by an extension of the Balmer formula : // where n is any number larger than 1 . ( This Lyman series was discovered in 1915 . ) The limiting frequency ( n = cc ) is , of course , here equal to R ( i.e. , 329 vibrations per subsecond ) . Infra-red Spectra. ? Analogous to these spectra with limits R and ; - 4R should we not expect other series in the infra-red with limits at ? 16R , etc. ? Actually such have been found by Paschen and by Brackett . These series have the formulas v = R ( 32 ? 71- Paschen series ( discovered 1896 ) v = R ( 42 -1 Brackett series ( discovered 1922 ) One line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed in the very far infra-red and doubtless it is only the experimental difficulty which prevents finding more of the lines and still other series . In general the frequencies of hydrogen are given by where nl and n2 are integers , n2 being the larger . Placing n equal to 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 gives , respectively , the Lyman , Balmer , Paschen , and Brackett series . Relations between Series ? Ritz Combination Principle .  - -  The limiting frequency of the Balmer series ( 82.2 vibrations per subsecond ) is equal to the difference between the first line and the limit of the Lyman series ; the limit of the Paschen series equals the difference between the first line and the limit of the Balmer series . This can be seen from the table ; the relation can be seen to follow directly from the series formula . We can thus easily compute the limits of series which have never been observed . Ritz observed ( 1908 ) that the sum or difference of two frequencies often gives the frequency of another line of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen . I f i he frequency of is added to that of the first , line of the Lyman series , it , gives that of the second line . H ? or I/ , similarly // combined gives the third or fourth line . The difference between H , . and H# gives the first line of the Paschen series ; Hy , ? H gives the first line of the Brackett series . So the whole spectrum can be worked out from the Balmer lines with the aid of the combination principle . The difference in frequencies between any two lines of this series always gives a line of another series . Spectroscopic Terms. ? The frequency of each line is seen to be given as a difference between two terms . In the Balmer series the first term is 82.2 ( i.e. , %R ) ; the second term takes the values HR , 1 i 6R , etc. ; the whole story of the hydrogen spectrum is summarized by the values of these spectroscopic terms . With somewhat greater precision than we have previously used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Series Formula. ? The spectrometer yields some of the most accurate results obtainable by measurement.The probable error for exactly measured wave lengths is usually of the order of 1 part in 10 million . And yet the Balmer formula agrees with results within the probable error of the experiment . Below we compare the observed values and those computed from t Ise foregoing terms which are based upon a value of Rydberg 's constant of 329.033073 . The Wave Number .  --  - Wavenumbers rather than frequencies are usually computed in the literature . In ordinary units the frequency of light ( waves pet second ) is always an inconveniently large number ( 10 ' " times greater than in our system ) . By the wave number ( v ) is meant the number of waves // per centimeter . It is found by taking the reciprocal of the wave length ( in centimeters ) . v is 3 X 1010 times smaller than v ( c.g.s . ) . We obtain these wave numbers of conventional use from our v ( atomic units ) by dividing the latter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends from v = 14,000 to = 25,000 . The limit of the Lyman series is = 109,677.7 waves per centimeter . When we use wave numbers rather than frequencies in the hydrogen formula " v = R ( na ? nz ) , the Rydberg constant equals 109,677.7 . This is the value found in the literature . Since with the atomic-unit system the frequencies are small numbers , we shall in general use the frequency v rather than the wave number and take R = 329 ( approximately ) . Correspondence Principle. ? ' Phis series relation as found by Balmer was quite inexplicable to the physicists of his day . With the atom thought of as an electric vibrator , series would indeed be expected but these series should consist of a fundamental and overtones of twice , three times , four times , etc. , the fundamental frequency . Now as a matter of fact if we could go to spectra extravagantly far in the infra-red , we should find there approximately this relation holding . Consider a series far beyond the Brackett series , as v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lines of this series have frequencies 0.075 , 0.145 , 0.200 , 0.250 , etc. , approaching the limit 0.82 vibrations per subsecond . Here the frequencies roughly appear as fundamental and first , second , third , etc. , harmonics . This is another instance of phenomena agreeing with classical theory at low frequencies and diverging more and more from it as the frequency is increased . When we shake an egg or rotate it back and forth not too rapidly , the egg acts as a rigid body , much as an oval stone . At , higher frequencies its nature betrays itself ; you can not spin an uncooked egg . I wonder if we may not find in this an analogy . At higher frequencies the inner nature of electrons and protons , their hardness , softness , rigidity , fluidity ? whatever term one uses for electron and proton properties ? begins to play a role and the ordinary mechanics which treats them as particles breaks down . However this may be , certainly the correspondence with classical theory invariably occurs at low frequencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // made it his " correspondence principle . " It was the guiding principle in the upbuilding of his system of atomic theory . More Complicated Series Formulas the Defect. ? The hydrogen series which have been considered are the prototypes of the series found with other elements . With these other elements , however , the series become more complicated and the series relations found are only approximate . The essential difference is that the terms now become R/ ( n + ? ) 2 where e is a fraction to be added to the whole number n . E will be called the " defect . " The general form of the series is as in hydrogen . This fact was discovered by Rydberg ( 1910 ) . The same Rydberg constants is used and the frequencies of the lines are given by a difference of two terms . Very significant these common properties of all spectra ! So the frequency of the yellow line of sodium is given by v = ( 1 ? 1 / 329 1.6262 2.116 = 50.8 vibrations per subsecond , the defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defect can assume several different values ; the result is that , corresponding to a single series of terms of hydrogen , there will he several series each characterized by its own defect in the case of heavier elements . Alkali Series. ? The Rydberg constant R ( 329 vibrations per subsecond ) or ( for spark spectra ) a multiple thereof is the basic frequency number in all spectra . The spectrum of sodium is quite typical of the alkalis . In the most important lines four different shielding defects are found . In the S terms the value of the defect is between 0.6 : Ind 11.7 ; the P terms it is about 0.1 ; in the D terms it is about ( 0.01 and in the h ' terms - 0.001 . More exact values are given in ' fable 26 . Principal Series .  --  The " principal series " of sodium consists of the lines // The series formula is figure where S equals 0.626 and the first term equals 124.3 ; the second figure This series expression can naturally be made as accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects P ; when we speak of an exact series relationship , however , it is implied that P should be constant . To what extent this is true is evident in the foregoing figures ? e ( in this case P ) is constant as to order of magnitude , but , especially between the first two terms , it is by no means exactly constant . The series relationship here is only suggestive rather than exactly valid . It is not , as in the case of hydrogen , an exact law . Other Alkali Series. ? The more important series found in the alkali metals are : Of these four series one has the limit 1S symbolic for ( 1 + S ) 2 two have the limit 2P , and one the limit 3D . For sodium these limits are , respectively , at 2414 angstroms in the ultra-violet , at 4080 angstroms in the violet , and at 8150 angstroms in the infra-red . While these are the more important series , others can he found such as those of the prineitr ( I series type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nP . Such series in each case will be in the infra-red , more or less inaccessible . The ones listed above are the strongest and most important . Comparison with Hydrogen . The values of the , S , P , D , F terms for sodium are given in Table 26.1 figure Effective Term Number and Terms for Sodium. ? The values of the S , P , D , and F defects can be read from the table . The defect is - 0.010 for the 3D term , - 0.001 for the 41 " term . The D and more especially the F defects are seen to be very small . The corresponding terms differ little from those of hydrogen . The frequency of any line is given as the difference of two terms ; . y. , for the principal series figure From the values of these separate terms the frequencies of mach spectrum line can be obtained by subtraction . The yellow line of sodium is ( 1S ) ? ( 2P ) = 50.8 . Let us compare these sodium terms with those of hydrogen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective quantum n n i l per " ' n. = 1.626 ; and the term is reduced from 329 to 124 . The fraction 0.626 is the defect . Corresponding to n = 2 are two terms , the first of the P and the second of the S type . The simple term n = 3 for hydrogen here breaks up into S , P , D 11 ' 1 s ; It 4 breaks up into four terms . The defects of the S , oil I ' terms are large ; for the D and F terms the constants are // small and negative . The D and F terms are very much " hydrogen-like . " The difference indeed between these hydrogen-like terms and the S and P terms with larger shielding defects is very fundamental ( page 197 ) . Multiplets. ? This breaking up of a single term in the hydrogen spectrum into several terms with different defects is the first of the complexities introduced when we consider the spectra of other elements . A second complexity is introduced in the finer multiplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far ignored . Actually the " yellow line " of sodium consists not of one but of two lines with wave lengths 5890 and 5896 angstroms . The P , D , and F ( but not the S ) shielding defects have each two values instead of one . The first of the P defects has values 0.116 and 0.117 and the term has values 73.48 and 73.43 . This difference , 0.05 vibration per subsecond , is too small to show a separation on the spectrogram in Fig. 52 , were this drawn exactly to scale . The doublet interval is greater for potassium , rubidium , and caesium ; in caesium the components in 1S ? 2P are several hundred angstroms apart . The alkalis are characterized by this doublet character of the spectrum . In the alkali earths ( second periodic group ) triplets and singlets are found instead of doublets ; in the third group ( the earths ) quartets and doublets ; in the next group quintets , triplets , and singlets , and so on in increasing complexity . This is the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom ; here we have summarized the accumulation of spectroscopic lore which Bohr found awaiting an explanation . Why the simple relations in the hydrogen spectrum : Why the defect ? And why the breaking up into multiplets and why the close correspondence between multiplets and chemical properties ? And why the Rydberg constant running through all spectroscopy ? In brief , what after all is an atom and how does it radiate ? CHAPTER XV ATOMS A LA BOHR The atom is a solar system . But its action is limited to discrete values . Energy and the quantum number . Changing orbits and radiating energy ; a remarkable derivation of the Rydberg constant . Energy levels . Ellipses and circles and what of it ? Stronger and heavier nuclei ? but always with a lone electron . S stands for slim and P stands for phatter . Relativity scores again . The Bohr theory is based upon an idea of Rutherford 's . Rutherford considered the atom to consist of a small positive charge ( the nucleus ) surrounded by a number of electrons . This differed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive charge extended throughout the whole volume of the atom proper and that the electrons were distributed through it ? like the plums in a plum pudding . The suggestion of Thomson 's had been very fertile ; he had suggested the building up of atoms by successive shells of electrons . But Rutherford 's newer conception of the nucleus was by no means a gratuitous idea ; the scattering of alpha rays had given unmistakable evidence of a small hard nuclear kernel . A Planetary Theory. ? The positive charge ( e* ) on this nucleus of the atom is proportional to the atomic number of the element . For hydrogen the charge on the nucleus is equal ( except for sign ) to the electronic charge , 37.1 atomic units . This smallest of positive charges is called the proton . Outside this , attracted to it , is one electron . The helium nucleus has a charge of 2 protons ; 2 electrons revolve about it . In lithium there is a nuclear charge of 3 , attracting 3 electrons  --  and so on through : ill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium has a charge of 92 protons and is surrounded by a cloud of 92 electrons . The Law of Force. ? Why should such atoms not collapse ? Why in the case of hydrogen should the electron not fall into the nucleus ? Bohr supposed that the electron rotated about the proton just as the earth goes about the sun . In his earliest development he supposed that the electronic orbit was circular . The force of attraction to the proton furnished the centripetal force ( mv2/r ) holding the electron in its orbit . There is then a definite relation between the velocity of the electron and the radius of the orbit . Since the force between two charges ( nucleus e* and electron e ) is e*e/r2 , we have Here the speed of the electrons is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius . This is the same law that governs the speed of the planets , Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , etc. , at their different distances from the sun . In fact the theory of Bohr is a planetary theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for planets hold for the motions of the electron around the nucleus in hydrogen . Rotational Action Quantized.  --  But this theory meets with one difficulty at the very start . An accelerated charge must , by classical electrodynamics , radiate ( page 103 ) . The electron in the hydrogen atom , always with central acceleration , should always radiate energy , tend to slow down , and in consequence it should assume an orbit of ever-decreasing radius ; the electron should spiral into the nucleus with ever-increasing frequency of rotation and ever-increasing frequency of the emitted light . The atom should always radiate and shrink to nothing ; the atom should radiate but not with a definite set of frequencies as in the observed line spectrum , rather with ever-differing frequencies giving a continuous spectrum . This was a most fundamental difficulty . Bohr did not compromise with it ; he assumed that the classical electrodynamics was wrong and that certain orbits could exist so attuned that in them radiation did not occur . These unique orbits were those in ( 21 ) // which the action was equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbits were possible for the electron . Since action equals momentum ( mv ) times distance ( 2irr ) we have the condition 27rmvr = nh ( 22 ) where n is an integer . This is Bohr 's quantum condition . It gives a quantum relation to be satisfied between v and r as well as the mechanical relation of Eq . ( 21 ) . n is called the quantum number . The smallest possible orbit will have the quantum number 1 ; i.e. , its action equals h . Other possible orbits will have quantum numbers equal to 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. , with corresponding multiple values of action . We may again compare the atom with the solar system . In the actual solar system the earth could , given a slightly different speed , occupy a slightly different orbit ; there are no favored orbits . ' The atom on the other hand is a solar system in which only certain orbits are possible . From Eqs. ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) it is now possible to solve for the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities , e , e , * and m , are known and n is an integer . We can eliminate v , getting figure or can eliminate r , getting figure Circular Orbits of Hydrogen. ? From Eq . ( 23 ) , it is clear that , since all other quantities are definite constants , the radius must depend upon n , i.e. , upon which multiple of the fundamental element of action ( h ) the orbit in question has . The radii of the different orbits will vary as n2. ( n is called the principal quantum number . ) The radius of the fundamental orbit can easily be obtained by the reader . For hydrogen e* is equal to e , the charge on the electron . The smallest orbit with n = 1 has a radius of angstrom. ' // Similarly the velocities are derivable . For example , for the 2X3,7 X37.12 first orbit v = 1 X 4 = 2160 km. per second . TABLE 27. - ELECTRON ORBITS IN THE Here we see the orbital radii increasing as 1 , 4 , 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverse roots of these radii : ( list ) etc . But perhaps the most fundamental property of each of these orbits is their action . I The action in successive orbits I increases as h , 2h , 3h , etc . The angular momentum ( mvr ) is equal to this action divided 1 , y 27r , h/2ir in the first state , 2h/27r in the second , etc . ( We shall represent h/27r Icy h . ) The electron is normally in the lowest orbit with quantum number 1 . The other rl ) i t s are not usually occupied . They are " virtual orbits , " orbits to which the electron can be displaced . Energies of the Orbits. ? All are familiar with the positive and negative potentials of electricity . It is conventional to speak of I he potential energy of two charges placed infinitely far apart as zero . T hen like charges are brought close together , they have a positive potential energy , an increased ability to do work ; when unlike charges are close together , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen atom have negative potential energy . The expression for potential energy is and for kinetic energy is ( equation ) The kinetic energy ispositive and by ( 21 ) is ( disregarding the sign ) half as great , as the ( always negative ) potential energy . The two are added // together to give the resulting total energy . The total energy will be always negative and equal ( except for the opposite sign ) to the kinetic energy . To illustrate : 1 . The electron and proton , about half an angstrom apart in the first orbit of hydrogen , have potential energy equal to 2 . The kinetic energy of the electron , with mass If 830 and with velocity 2160 meters per second , is 3 . Net energy of the electron is - 1300 atomic ergs . The expression for the total energy ( W ) in the nth orbit is ( 25 ) W = - 2mv2 = ? ra2h2 This negative energy is inversely as the square of the quantum number . In the first orbit = - 1300 atomic ergs ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the energy rises nearer and nearer to the zero limit . In Fig. 61 are represented the energies of the different orbits of the hydrogen atom . The highest level represents the zero energy corresponding to the completely removed electron ( ionization ) . The other levels represent the energies of other possible electron orbits . The depths of the different levels are in the ratios 1 : i4 : % , etc . Such energy-level diagrams are very useful . Hydrogen Spectra. ? Bohr now assumes that it is while jumping from one orbit to another that the electron radiates energy ; by the quantum theory the frequency of the radiation is proportional to the energy . Radiated energy = by ( 17 ) Thus after an atom has been excited so that the electron is in ( say ) the third orbit ( energy - 1.15 atoink ; ergs , see Figs. 55 and // 61 ) , it may jump back to the second orbit ( energy - 327 ) or to the first ( energy - 1305 ) . Each such energy difference ( 182 and 1178 atomic ergs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantum . Dividing by h gives the frequencies 45.7 and 292 , respectively ( see Tables 22 and 23 ) . By this transition from the third level to the second or to the first we get a line of the Balmer or of the Lyman series . The Series Formula. ? Let us represent the constant 2ir2me4/h3 by R. Then the energy of the nth orbit of hydrogen is ? Rhn2 and , if the electron falls from the n2th orbit to the nith orbit , the difference in its energy will be Rh 1 n 2 ? 2Z ? This energy is radiated as light whose frequency is given given by Energy quantum = figure and hence figureeneral series relation for the hydrogen spectrum t he generalized Balmer formula . And , the most remarkable circumstance , R , which can be computed from the e , m , and h is exactly ( within experimental error ) equal to the Rydberg constant . Orbital Transitions and Spectrum Lines. ? When electrons jump back from any of her into the lowest energy level ( quantum number I ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first line if // the transition is from the second level , the second line if from the third , etc . The Balmer series is due to electrons falling down into the second level from the third , fourth , fifth , etc . The Paschen series is due to transitions down to the third , the Brackett series to transitions down into the fourth , etc . The lines of any one series are characterized by a common terminal level . It is clear enough from this picture of Bohr 's why the frequency difference between the first and second lines of the Lyman series gives the first Balmer line . As the quantum number increases , the energy levels ( Fig. 61 ) differ less and less between successive orbits and the lines in the series get closer and closer together . The limit of the series of lines corresponds to a transition from the zero energy level itself into the appropriate final level . The quantum for the limiting frequency of the series ( hv , ; , , , ) is exactly equal to the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the innermost orbit of hydrogen is ? Rh and equals - 1305 atomic ergs . It is h times the limiting frequency ( 329 ) of the Lyman series . This is the energy which must be given to an atom of hydrogen to ionize it . When an electron is accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt , it acquires an energy of 96.4 atomic ergs . The ionizing potential of hydrogen is 1305/96.4 = 13.5 volts . The energies of the atomic levels are often conveniently expressed in electronvolts . Such a scale is given in Fig. 61 . Intraatomic Motion. ? Now for some comparisons . The molecules in a gas under standard conditions are on the average about 30 angstroms apart ; the atoms in a solid are usually several angstroms apart . The diameter of the normal orbit of the hydrogen atom is 1.06 angstroms by the Bohr theory . ( How does this compare with the sphere of influence of the hydrogen molecule ? ) The outer , virtual orbits are larger . Thirty-one lines of the Balmer series have been measured . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirty-third orbit . Its diameter is more than a thousand times ( 33 squared ) that of the normal orbit ? over a thousand angstroms large . Such an atom can exist only in a well-nigh perfect vacuum ? the spectrum is observed in nebulae . The electrons in the normal orbit travel 2200 km. ( almost 1,500 miles ) a second . This is almost the distance between Chicago and San Francisco in a second . ( I low does this compare // with the speed of a molecule or free electron at room temperature ? ) Taking the diameter as 1 angstrom and the circumference as 317 angstroms , the electron must make 2200/317 or 700 revolutions per subsecond . Notice that the frequency of the radiation ( Lyman series , Table 23 ) is quite different from the electron 's frequency of rotation . This theory of Bohr 's has been surprisingly transformed in recent years . This velocity of revolution has nearly dropped out of the picture ( Chap . XXVII ) . The heart of Bohr 's model is in the different energy states which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 KT or about 4 atomic ergs at room temperature . It takes about 1300 atomic ergs completely to ionize a hydrogen atom and three-quarters as much energy to raise the electron from the first to the second orbit . ( How much to raise it to the third ? To the fourth ? ) When one contemplates Maxwell 's distribution law and sees how small is the chance of having even three times the average velocity , he realizes that the chance of a gas molecule 's having sufficient energy to ionize an atom by collision is very remote indeed ! Even a displacement to the nearest orbit ( n = 2 ) requires a thousand atomic ergs . The atom acts as a rigid , unalterable particle during molecular collisions . The Correspondence Principle. ? The strange procedure of Bohr was to accept the ordinary laws of electricity in Eq . ( 21 ) , limit their validity in Eq . ( 22 ) , and finally , in computing the frequency of emission , to neglect ordinary electrodynamics entirely and to use Planck 's quantum law Eq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atom as a simple vibrating system , expected to find in the spectrum fundamentals and overtones , to find a fundamental frequency and harmonics with double , triple , quadruple , etc. , frequencies . Instead of which I hey found the relations described by Balmer . Now while Bohr insisted that the emitted frequencies of the light , wave were not the rotational frequencies of the electron in t he atom , there was yet a certain relation between the rotational and radiated frequencies . So when an electron jumped from t he third to the second orbit , the HL line was emitted with a frequency of 46 ; this frequency appeared to be a kind of mean between t he rotational frequency ( 33 ) in the third orbit and that in the second orbit ( 110 ) . By the classical theory , while the electron was going from one orbit to the other , the radius of // the path of the electron would have gradually decreased and the frequency increased and a continuous band of different frequencies between these values , 33 and 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single mean frequency was emitted . The second line of the Balmer series with frequency 62 corresponded roughly to the first overtone of this , and so on ( page 172 ) . The correspondence here is rather rough . It becomes better in the Paschen and Brackett series and , as we go to the outer levels where the rotational frequencies become slower and slower , the correspondence becomes very close . The case is analogous to that of black-body radiation where the classical theory is correct for low frequencies . The classical theory is never exactly the equivalent of the quantum theory but there is always a correspondence between them which becomes more and more exact as the frequencies become lower . It was on the basis of this correspondence principle , loose as it is , that Bohr originally developed his theory and many of the more important later results have been developed from this principle . Elliptical Orbits. ? For simplicity we have supposed that the electron moved in a circular orbit ; Bohr originally made the same assumption . A planetary orbit in general is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major and minor axes of the ellipse happen to be equal . So it is for the electron . It was Sommerfeld who first investigated these elliptical orbits . His results are ( 1 ) that only certain discrete states of elliptical motion are possible and ( 2 ) that , as far as energies are concerned , the shape of the orbit ( in the case of hydrogen ) makes little difference ? but that little difference is of unusual interest . We can not give the solution of this problem in detail but the general method is straightforward . In addition to rotary motion and angular momentum and angular action , the electron in the ellipse will have radial velocity and radial momentum and radial action . That is , except when the orbit is circular , the electron will have one component of its velocity along the line toward the nucleus . The momentum to and fro along this radial direction times the radial distance traversed to and fro in the course of a revolution gives the radial action . There are now two quantum conditions : Angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) // The integers k and n ' are called angular ' and radial quantum numbers ; k + n ' = n is the total or principal quantum number . If n ' is zero , there is no radial motion and the orbit is a circle . If Ic were zero , the motion would be directly toward the nucleus and there would be a collision . Such motion is not allowable ? k can not be zero . ( We are here following the argument as it was spun by Bohr , Sommerfeld , and their followers . ) The major axis of the ellipse is determined by the principal quantum number n , the minor axis by the angular quantum number k as shown in the table . The orbits are often represented with the angular numbers as subscripts . The circular orbits 1 , , 22 , 33 , with diameters 1 , 4 , 9 angst Toms , respectively , have already been considered . The // other orbits have the minor axis reduced in proportion to k as shown in Fig. 56 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , P , D , and ( for k = 4 ) F types . ' We shall usually not be greatly concerned with the exact size or position of the orbits . It may be convenient to represent them as concentric rather than confocal . It is also convenient to draw the larger orbits in reduced scale , so that the major axes are as 1:2:3 , etc. , rather than 1:4:9 , etc . On this scale all the S orbits will have a common minor axis of 1 , the P orbits a 2p 3p minor axis of 2 , the D orbits a minor axis of 3 , etc . It is understood that this is an arbitrary distortion , used in Fig. 57 for convenience in representation . Energy of Elliptical Orbits , without Relativity. ? There is but one orbit with n = 1 , two with n = 2 , three with n = 3 , etc . This multiplicity of orbits should presumably add greatly to the complexity of the spectrum . But , as Sommerfeld remarked , the energy of an orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major axis and hence only upon the principal quantum number . The energy is equal to 2ir2e4m/n2h2 and hence the consideration of the possible ellipticity seems rather superfluous . Several distinct orbits of a common major axis ( as 3S , 3P , 3D ) degenerate into a single one as far as energy is concerned ; the system is said to be degenerate.2 This is all just as it is in the motion in the solar system . The astronomer needs only the major axis of the orbit to determine One of my students reminded me that S stands for slim , P stands for phattcr , D for decidedly phat and F for fcry decidedly phat ? which may or may not be a memory aid . Actually the letters are derived from the old designations of sharp , principal , difuse , and fundamental series . 2 A familiar example of degeneracy is of a pendulum ? a ball on the end of a string . To specify its state of vibration completely , we must know its greatest x extension /and greatest y extension ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y2 ; i.e. , upon the amplitude but not on the nigh of the line of vibration . // the energy , kinetic and potential , of a planet of given mass ; he needs the minor axis as well to determine the angular momentum . In our Fig. 57 with its reduced scale , all ellipses meeting with common major axes are alike in energy ; all those with common minor axes are alike in angular momentum Eq . ( 27 ) . The Relativity Correction. ? The degeneracy of this system is complete , however , only as long as we use ordinary mechanics and neglect relativity . The electron speeds up as it approaches A the nucleus in the elliptical orbit , there is a corresponding increase in mass which at these speeds is not to be neglected , and as a consequence there is a precession of the orbit ( just as is the case of the planet Mercury ) ) . The orbit is not exactly a closed ellipse and the rates of precession and the energies of the orbits of different eccentricity differ somewhat one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends primarily upon the principal quantum number ; but when relativity is considered , it depends to a slight extent upon the angular number . The effect is very small . There is only a single precession in some tens of thousands of revolutions ; the actual frequency difference introduced in the Balmer lines is no more than a single vibration in a thousand subseconds ! Each line of the Balmer series should // appear as a doublet with a separation about one-fiftieth that of the sodium doublet . While this is a very small frequency difference , instruments of highest resolving power have shown that it certainly exists . ' This result confirms at once the theory we are developing of the atom and the theory of relativity as applied to the atomic world . Spark Spectrum of Helium. ? Helium has a nuclear charge ( e* ) of 2e , lithium of 3e . In general , the charge on the nucleus can be expressed as Ze where Z is the atomic number . If now all the electrons save one are stripped from one of these heavier atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orbit almost exactly like that of the hydrogen electron except smaller . The radii of the orbits will be . and the energies will be and the spectrum formula will be The radii of orbits of the same quantum number n decrease as the atomic number ( Z ) increases . They are inversely proportional to Z. The negative energies of the orbits and the frequencies of corresponding series are proportional to Z2 . Spectra of such atoms stripped down to a single electron have been observed only in the case of helium . This " spark spectrum " due to the He+ ion is well-known.2 Z is here equal to 2 . The radius of the normal orbit of this helium ion is by Eq . ( 23 ' ) ' The upper level energy is also split , the electron spin has its influence , and the new quantum mechanics has modified the theory . The effect is more pronounced in ionized helium . In so far as the necessary resolution can be obtained , the experiment agrees with the theory . 2 The strong lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced farther into the ultra-violet ; possibly this is the reason that these have not been observed . ( 23 ' ) ( 25 ' ) ( 26 ' ) // angstrom ; each virtual orbit is half as large as the corresponding one of hydrogen . By Eq . ( 25 ' ) the ionization potential of the helium ion is four times as great as that of hydrogen . This spark spectrum , by Eq . ( 26 ' ) , is similar to the spectrum of hydrogen except that each series in He+ has a fourfold greater frequency . The limit of the shortest hydrogen spectrum is 912 angstroms , of the shortest He+ spectrum 228 angstroms . The series formula is v=4R ( 1 1 ) n12 n22 It is the hydrogen formula with a series constant 4R instead of R. The story of the discovery of these spark spectra of helium is interesting . It is evident that the " Balmer like " spectrum of He+ should have alternate lines identical with the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen . For when n has an even value ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 , 8 , etc 1 . ) , the22 n / can be written as RG ? m21 m = 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . It was early found that , whenever the spark spectrum of helium was excited , the " lines of hydrogen appeared . " Hence before the time of Bohr it was supposed that hydrogen was always present in the helium ! It was not thought likely that the two elements could have these lines in common . Reaction of the Nucleus. ? Actually the He+ spectra have frequencies about lAo per cent greater than those predicted above , and the correspondence between the helium spark lines and the hydrogen lines differs by this amount . This difference ' is due to the reaction of the nucleus . In our solar system it is not quite exact to speak of our earth as rotating about the sun ; actually both earth and sun rotate about their common center of gravity . So it is with the electron in the hydrogen atom . 1 The effect is exactly allowed for if , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all formulas ? = M M mm is used as an effective mass . ( Here M represents the mass of the nucleus . ) Using this in Eq . ( 25 ' ) introduces a figure sauced mass and is quite generally employed in atomic formulas instead of figure // Since the mass of the hydrogen nucleus is 1840 times greater than that of the electron , the common center of gravity is only X1841 removed from the nucleus . The difference introduced is , however , not negligible . It reduces the energy of the system in this same proportion . And so it is with the electron in the helium ion except that here the nucleus is 7360 times heavier than the electron , the center of gravity is four times closer to the He nucleus , and the energy reduction is four times less than in the case of hydrogen . There is then a displacement in the ratio of 4 X ? %s40 ( i.e. , 1 part in 2450 ) between the lines of hydrogen and the almost identical helium lines mentioned above . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nuclear motion would be even less important than in the case of helium . In very heavy atoms the nucleus remains at rest and no correction is required . The effect of the nuclear motion is to reduce R by 1 part in 7360 for helium . The values of the constant for hydrogen , helium , and heavy atoms as determined from the spectra are The spectroscopic results have given an independent method ? and one of the best ? of determining the ratio of the mass of the electron to that of the hydrogen atom . The exact value found by comparing R11 and Ro is 1.846 . Summary. ? Bohr 's theory is of the greatest importance . It is the gateway through which we enter into the world of the atom . Its success meant the general acceptance of Planck 's quantum theory . Out of ( a ) the classical equation : e*e/rm = mv2/r ; and ( b ) the quantum equation : action = nh , the simple circular orbits were derived . With ( c ) the radiation formula : energy = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evaluation of Rydberg 's constant . The spark spectrum of helium is also completely explained . Elaboration of the simple theory led to the consideration of the mutual motion of the nucleus ( with a slight alternation in Rydberg 's constant ) and the consideration of elliptical orbits . The latter together with the theory of relativity explains the fine structure of hydrogen lines ; elliptic orbits are of great importance in more complicated spectra . CHAPTER XVI OUTER SHELLS Exposed electrons are valence electrons ; they rotate about the kernel . But the kernel does not act entirely like a point charge ? hence the S , P , D , and F defects . The electron spins ? and hence the multiplets . Spectra of stripped atoms . The Bohr theory is a key to the atomic world . It was fashioned to open a single room ? to open to us the secrets of the hydrogen atom . But the key proved to be a master key ; without much difficulty other doors were opened . After Bohr pictured the hydrogen atom , models of other atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar systems " with not one but many electronic " planets " rotating about the nuclear " sun . " Many of the orbits of Bohr in these heavier atoms become populated with electrons ; they are no longer merely virtual orbits . Depending upon the number of electrons in the atom , the first quantum orbit , the second quantum orbit , the third orbit , perhaps others , may become populated . Only the outer orbits are left unoccupied and virtual . The " solar system " of helium has two electronic " planets " both in the first quantum orbit ; the next element ( lithium ) has 3 electrons , 2 in the first and 1 in the second orbit ' ( Fig. 53 ) . The following elements ( beryllium , boron , carbon , nitrogen , etc. ) add other electrons to this second orbit until , at the tenth element neon , it is " full . " The eleventh element sodium has 11 electrons : 2 in the first , 8 in the second , and 1 in the third quantum state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the outer orbit . It is this single outer electron which makes of it an alkali . Beyond the outermost electron in the atom are always virtual orbits to which the electron can be displaced . It is the play of the outer electron among these virtual orbits which gives rise to the visible spectrum . Transitions between the interior ( normally occupied ) orbits are betrayed by x-rays . Among the atoms 1 94 // hydrogen is peculiar ; it has but one electron , which is at the same time the " outermost " and the " innermost " electron . Its spectrum closely resembles both the x-ray spectra and the optical spectra of other elements . In this and succeeding chapters we must recount something of what is known of these electrons in the atom . We can but sketch the broader features , only so much as is absolutely necessary to comprehend what is meant by man 's discovery of the atom . Yet even this barest outline will occupy the next seven chapters . The Kernel . Let us look to the outer atom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take Millikan 's e and Thomson 's m and Planck 's h and Michelson 's c and compute from them exactly the wave lengths emitted by the hydrogen atom or the helium ion . We can do this with a precision as great as the precision with which these atomic constants have been determined ( a few tenths per cent ) . The relative values of the different wave lengths are given within %500 of 1 per cent ! The same kind of computation can be made for the two electrons of neutral helium , although this is a much more difficult task . ' But beyond this we can not go . It is too complicated a problem to attempt to compute exactly the orbits of each of the 11 electrons in sodium or of the 92 electrons in uranium . Each is attracted to the center by the large nuclear charge , each electron repels the others , each has its magnetic field interacting with all others . But although we can not solve the problem exactly , we can readily understand the general situation . I n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outermost shell ; these alkalis have a close optical and chemical similarity t o hydrogen . We shall not look closely at the other electrons , t hose in the inner orbits ; we may think of them as a cloud surrounding the nucleus . The nucleus and the surrounding cloud of inner electrons is called the " kernel " of the atom . The positive charge on the nucleus is ( in terms of the protonic charge ) equal to the atomic number ; the number of electrons in the kernel is one less than this . Outside the kernel , the Z units of positive charge on the nucleus are nearly neutralized by the Z ? 1 negative electrons ; the whole kernel acts as a particle with a // single positive charge . The kernel for the alkalis takes the place of the nucleus in hydrogen . It has effectively a single positive charge and attracts a single outer ( valence ) electron . Hence the spectrum constant is R itself , not a multiple of R as in spark spectra . Shielding Defects. ? Did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equivalent number of nuclear charges , an alkali spectrum would be identical with the spectrum of hydrogen . We should have for the spectrum of an alkali the 1 generalized Balmer formula v = RI n2 ? n22 . Actually the shielding is not perfect ; it is especially imperfect at points near the kernel . The kernel can not be considered as a point charge and the electric field is not exactly proportional to 1/r2 . In consequence of this departure from the inverse square law of force , the elliptical orbits precess much as they do in hydrogen ( where the effect is due to the relativistic variation in mass ) . In this case , however , the precession is of much more importance . Owing to this imperfect shielding and to the resultant precession , the energy of the orbit will depend markedly upon its shape . The energy will still probably be determined chiefly by the major axis and by the principal quantum number ( n ) but yet in large part it will depend on the minor axis and the angular quantum number ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have values Rh/ ( n + e ) 2 where n is the principal quantum number 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc. , and e is a fractional constant whose value will depend upon whether the orbit is of the S , P , D , F , etc. , type . The constant e is called the shielding defect . ( n + e ) is called the effective quantum number ( Chap . XIV ) . In the case of sodium e is about 0.65 for the most elongated type of orbit ( S orbits ; k = 1 ) , 0.13 for the rounder P orbits , - 0.01 for D orbits , and - 0.001 for F orbits . For example , for the S levels , the energies are given approximately ' by // Penetrating and Nonpenetrating Orbits. ? These orbits all resemble those of hydrogen with a difference ; the difference is represented by the defect . The defects for the D and F orbits are quite small and these two orbits are very much hydrogen-like . Hydrogen-like orbits are found in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singly charged kernel . The large F orbits are far removed from the kernel ; they lie in a region where the field is not greatly different from the inversesquare type . Here the orbits will be nearly true ellipses ; the 4D Cernel k precession may amount to only a few minutes of arc in a revoluI ion . In the D orbits the precession may amount to a number of degrees . The precession of a 4D orbit in the sodium is represented in Fig. 60 . The P orbits and 8 orbits actually penetrate within the kernels . Here all resemblance to the hydrogen orbit is lost effectively t his penetration results in a very great precession as shown in the I ! ' orbit of Fig. 60.1 These P and S orbits have large shielding defects . // Ionization Potentials of Alkalis. ? Of all atoms it is in the alkalis that the outer electron is most loosely bound and of the alkalis the binding is least in caesium . The normal orbit occupied by the outer electron is 1s ( n = 1 , k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbits are given in Table 29 . TABLE 29. - IS STATES OF ALKALIS These ionizing potentials are very low in comparison with that of hydrogen ( 13.5 volts ) . The electron is readily removed . It is because of this that alkalis are so very active chemically . The alkali is very apt to give up an electron and form a positive ion . Common salt ( Na+Cl- ) is composed of positive sodium and negative chlorine ions ; the chlorine atom is as apt in capturing as sodium is in losing an electron . In solution the opposite ions in the salt dissociate ? the solution becomes a conductor . The alkaline character is strongest in caesium ; this is obvious from the ionizing potentials . The Selection Principle ( Angular Number k ) . ? An electron can not jump from a D type orbit or from an F type orbit into an S orbit . Series of the type 1S ? nD are not found . Nor are transitions between orbits of the same type found . In any transition an electron must change its angular quantum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S to P or from I ) to P or from F to D are permitted . In Fig. 57 ( with reduced scale ) the minor axis must become one greater or one smaller in each transition . The theoretical foundation for this rule is found in the conservation of angular momentum . This angular momentum of the electron ( h , 2h , etc. ) // in its orbital motion about the nucleus is not the total momentum of the atom . We shall give the theoretical basis for a similar selection principle on page 204 after we have introduced the inner quantum number j . Transitions to the Most Eccentric ( S ) Orbits. ? The energy levels of sodium are shown in Fig. 61 . The lowest and normal orbit of the alkalis is the 1S orbit . For sodium the energy in this orbit is - 496 atomic ergs , and the frequency number is Electrons can drop into this state from the 2P , 3P , 4P , etc. , levels and give the lines of the principal series . v = 1S ? nP ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the effective quantum numbers ( n + e ) for sodium are This gives for frequencies of the earlier lines of the principal series ; 50 , 90 , 105 vibrations per stlbsecontl , etc. // Other series of this same type occur with the formulas v=2S ? nPorv=3S ? nP but such series lie in the infra-red and are not easily observable . Transitions to the P Orbits. ? Transitions to the 2P orbit can occur from higher S or D orbits These two are sometimes grouped as the two subordinate series . Less important subordinate series are of the types Transitions to the D Orbits . The possible transitions to the 3D orbits are In the Bergmann series both terms ( 3D , nF ) are hydrogen-like ; consequently the wave lengths of the lines differ little from the Paschen series of hydrogen For this reason the series , though comparatively weak , was once supposed to be of fundamental importance and is sometimes called the " fundamental " series ( hence the letter F ) . The elliptical orbits of Sommerfeld ( together with the selection principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To explain the doublet character of the lines a new quantum number must be introduced . Doublets. ? It has been said that each line in the alkali spectrum is double . The yellow line of sodium is really two lines with wave lengths 5890 and 5896 angstroms . These doublets are shown somewhat exaggerated in Figs. 52 and 61 . The spectrum Fig. 52 is represented on a frequency scale ; the frequency interval in this 5890 to 5896 doublet is 0.05 vibration per subsecond or a fifth of an atomic erg difference in energy . The same doublet interval is found whenever a 2P term occurs , as throughout the sharp and diffuse series and the first member of the principal series ( see Figs. 52 and 61 ) . Clearly there are two 2P terms differing by 0.115 in vibration number . ( ' These Iwo terms are // denoted by 22P3z and 22Py , . ) The doublet separation decreases as we go from 2P to 3P , 4P , etc . This is shown in the principal series . The D orbits are likewise double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diffuse series . ( In sodium the D doublet interval is too small to be detected ; it is represented in Figs. 52 and 61 to indicate the characteristics of the heavier alkalis . ) Undoubtedly the less eccentric ( F , G , H , etc. ) orbits likewise are double although such doublets can not be resolved . Electron Spin . The Bohr atom has been compared with a solar system . One feature of planetary motion has , however , been left out of the picture : in addition to the orbital revolution about the sun -e -e a planet rotates on its axis . If this spin is in the same sense as the orbital motion ( for instance , if both are clockwise ) , the angular FIG. " ? orbital momentum and kinetic energy of the planet are increased by the spin , if in the opposite two opposite spins : sense decreased . So it is with the atom . Every 8 = o. electron is not only an elementary charge , it is as well an element ary magnet with a north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kernel , let us say in the 2P orbit , the electron spins and this spin is either exactly parallel or exactly antiparallel to t he orbital motion . And the spin is quantized . The action of I Ile spin of the electron is a constant and its value is zh . The angular momentum of the electron as it spins on its own axis is 1 Lh. ( h = h/2ir. ) ' fire story is the same with higher P orbits or with a D orbit or an F orbit . For any P orbit k is 2 ; adding or subtracting the spin gives angular momentum of or % ( times h ) . For the D orbits k is 3 ; spin produces two states , one with momentum % , one with The F doublets have angular momentum 9 or ? z . These are the values given by the Bohr theory . However , it appears that these values are in error . A Dilemma. ? S orbits are always single . This means that the moment um of electron spin does not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . P orbits and D . // orbits are double but every S orbit is single . If the angular momentum of these S orbits , these thinnest of orbits , is indeed one unit ( in terms of h ) as we have supposed , we should then expect that the spin could either add or subtract a half unit to this . Actually it only adds . We have , following Bohr and Sommerfeld , taken the angular action in the S orbits , neglecting spin , as h . But why this behavior ? It would be explicable if all our angular momenta were one unit too large . This would make the atom in the S state devoid of revolutionary motion and naturally the spin could only add . Such an assumption is impossible on the Bohr theory . Yet we are forced to take the total angular momentum of the atom as given by the vector combination of the spin and ( k ? 1 ) h . We shall find the answer to this paradox ; for some pages it must remain for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a mystery . Quantum Numbers. ? Corresponding to this total angular momentum , to this combination of k ? 1 and spin , another quantum number j is introduced . It is called the inner quantum number and its value is taken as one less than the half-integral momentum numbers found above . For instance , the inner quantum number of the P states is either I A or 1 is usually introduced for k ? 1 . j = ( k ? 1 ) ? i = l ? ( 29 ) j is a measure of the total angular momentum of the atom . Angular momentum = jh . ( See Fig. 64 . ) A doublet term such as those above is often represented as 2S , 2P , 2D . The S term is represented similarly to the others to show that it belongs to a doublet system , although it is understood that no actual doubling can ever occur in an S term . To distinguish between the two terms of a doublet , the inner quantum number is added in the nomenclature as 2P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals for the P doublets of the alkalis ( AW in atomic ergs ) : Li 0.004 ; Na 0.2 ; K 0.7 ; Rb 2.9 ; Cs 6.8 ( The doublet separation of lithium is extremely small ; it is about the same size as the relativity doublet of hydrogen . ) In Table 30 are given the terms for caesium . Resume Alkali Spectra .  --  - There is a single valence-electron outside the kernel in the alkalis . As in hydrogen , it , has its // principal quantum number n = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . ( In view of the penetrating orbits the numbers here given are not always correct but this need not concern us at this point . ) These numbers represent , in terms of h , the action , angular and radial combined , of the atom . But unlike hydrogen the energies of the different states are far from depending on this principal number alone . Hence the different series of levels S , P , D , F , G , etc. 7 In the Bohr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( in terms of h ) the angular momentum . When n = 2 , k can equal either 2 or 1 ( the Bohr circle and ellipse ) when n = 3 , k can equal 3 or 2 or 1 . The S states are the most elongated , with k = 1 ; we have the 1S , 2S , 3S , etc. , states . The I ' states have k = 2 ; the D states k = 3 . For the same principal quantum number , the most eccentric ( S ) states have the highest energies ; the 3S state lies above the 3P and this above the 3D i n the energy-level diagram . Bohr 's exact interpretation of these states as definite circles and ellipses while very useful is not entirely correct . The wave I ! ivory of the atom is discussed briefly in Chap . XXVII . Actually I he angular momentum of the electron in its orbit must be la ken as given by 1 = k ? 1 . Despite Bohr , there is no angular momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the I ' states the angular momentum is h , in the D states 2h . The foregoing is quite general and holds for any atom . An alkali spectrum , however , is characterized by consisting of doublets . Each level , except those of the S type , is split into two , differing comparatively little in energy . To explain this we Introduce the spin of the electron . The angular momentum of the spin of a single electron is always equal to ) h ( quantum number 1.2 ) . The total angular momentum is represented by j // ( inner quantum number ) . According as this spin is in the same sense or opposite to the orbital motion j is % greater or less than 1 . So for the P orbits j is or ; for the D orbits j is i or 3 . The nomenclature ( 3 'D : : , 32D , L , 4'P , z7 etc. ) gives in compact form all of these orbital characteristics , n , 1 , j , and s. ( s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doublet which in turn means a single electron with s = ; . ) The electron transitions between these energy levels are limited by the orbital selection rule : Al = ? 1 . Selection Principle for j and the Angular Momentum of the Photon. ? j can change by ? 1 or ( unlike 1 ) by 0 . ( Except that the transition 0 ? 0 is barred . ) This selection principle follows from the conservation of angular momentum . jh is the total angular momentum of the atom . ' This angular momentum can not change without a compensating ( opposite ) momentum change elsewhere . Light has momentum . The quantum of light given out by a single transition also often has angular momentum . The light quantum is then circularly polarized and the angular momentum of the single photon is equal to h . Or in other cases the emitted light quantum ( in the single photon ) may be linearly polarized , as if emitted from a small vibrating charge . Its angular momentum is then zero . But no single photon can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated from the classical theory of radiation ; its proof lies outside our scope ( see Sommerfeld , page 257 ) . Since the angular momentum of the photon is not greater than h , it follows from the conservation of momentum that in emitting a quantum of light the angular momentum of the atom must change by ? h or remain unchanged . This gives the selection rule . Angular momentum is a vector . The selection rule limits the change in the direction of the axis of rotation of the atom ( as given by the selection rule for m , page 230 ) as well as the magnitude of its angular momentum . The selection rule for the orbital momentum ( 1 ) ( page 198 ) is based on similar considerations . The selection principle was also derived by Bohr as a special application of his correspondence principle . It is easy to follow the application in the special case of circular orbits . An elect ron in a circular orbit can not change its quantum number ( in this // case n = k ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected motion is simple harmonic . There are no overtones . Hence in the correspondence which exists between classical and quantum mechanics , where overtones correspond to double or greater electron jumps , there must be no On greater than unity . Two Valence Electrons ? the Mercury Spectrum. ? All elements give spectra which are basically the same as those of the alkalis . The most important difference is in the multiplicity of the lines . Mercury may be considered as typical of the elements of the second group of the periodic table . Its spectrum is shown in Fig. 68 . Instead of doublets there are here singlets and triplets . The mercury nucleus has 80 positive charges . The kernel has 78 electrons ; there are two outer , valence electrons . It is the presence of these two outer electrons which introduces the chief difference between the mercury spectrum with its singlets and triplets and the doublet spectrum of sodium or caesium . These outer electrons are normally in a 1S orbit . One of them may be displaced to one of the many virtual orbits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This displaced electron will be attracted now by approximately a single positive charge , the 79 electrons neutralizing all but one of the 80 nuclear charges . The screening is not perfect , of course , and the defect term E appears . The general form of the term is as before R/ ( n ? e ) Both electrons may be displaced ; usually , however , only one is displaced from the IS orbit , and this is the only case which will be considered . The Spin Quantum Number. ? When the total spin momentum of the atom is considered , account must be taken of the spins ( I ? I : ) of each of these outer electrons . These electrons may be spinning oppositely and the spin momenta cancel ; they may be spinning similarly and the two spin actions add up to h . We speak of a spin quantum number s ; for a single electron s is ? for two electrons it may be either zero or 1 . When these combined spins are zero , no multiplicity of levels can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ( or rather with Ilse principal and inner quantum numbers included as 4 ' So , 2 ' /'I , etc . ) . When the combined spins are equal to h ( i.e. , s = 1 ) the P , I ) , I ? ' levels : ire triple . We have the 35 , level and the 3Po , " P , , ' l ' , , levels and similarly for the I ) and F ' types . // Singlet Levels of Mercury. ? The terms as usual are represented by R/ ( n + e ) 2 where the defect e depends primarily upon the angular quantum number . The value of the defect and the terms of the singlet system of mercury are given below . Compare these values with the corresponding hydrogen terms . Each of these energy levels is here evaluated in vibration number . Singlet Spectrum Lines. ? Out of these levels arise the singlet series of lines which are given ( in frequency and wave length ) in Table 32 . Triplet Levels of Mercury. ? In each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning oppositely ; the combined spin is zero . Below are listed the triplet states of mercury , due to electrons spinning in the same direction . The most important triplet series are 1 . // Lines such as 23Po ? n3D2 , etc. , are ruled out by the selection principle for the inner quantum number . Combination Series. ? The first principal series of triplets does 2DS/2 not occur , owing to the absence of the 13S term . ' However , electrons may fall from the 3 levels into the 13So level , giving a combination series . ( Transitions from 3Po or 3 levelsare barred by the selection principle . ) This falling from a triplet to a singlet level is a rather complicated process for the atom ; not only does the electron 2si2 h change orbits but the electron 2n must reverse its direction of spin . Nevertheless , the series is quite strong . The first line of the principal combination series of mercury 1'So ? 23PI with wave length 2537 is the best known of all ultra-violet lines . Formation of Multiplets. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reduced angular momentum 1 and the spin s is beautiful because of its simplicity . We have seen how each individual electron has a spin of %h . For the alkalis this is the total spin of the atom ( s = ? 2 ) . When two electrons are present , according as they are parallel or // anti-parallel , the total spin will be h or 0 . If there are three electrons as in the third periodic group , the spin can be h ( if all electrons spin alike ) ; of /h ( if only two spin alike ) . With four electrons the spins can total 0 or 1 or 2 . So the spin quantum number s is % for the alkalis , 0 or 1 for the alkali earths , or for the earths , and so on . Singlets , doublets , triplets , and other multiplets are formed because of the combination of the spin with the orbital motion of I he electron . Just as the orbital momentum and the spin are quantized separately , so the combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is represented by the inner quantum number j . If s is an integer , j is an integer ; if s is or or j is also a half number . Figure 64 shows the angular momenta in the alkali doublets . The largest value which j can have is 1 + s ; the smallest value ( when spin and revolution are opposite ) is 1 ? s . In higher multiplets the two sectorsors representing spin and revolution can also be at an angle , giving of her values differing by h , 2h , 3h , etc. from these extremes . So the triplet levels of mercury shown in Fig. 65 have j equal to 2 , I , am ! O. In thallium s may be and the quadruplet D hovels have J = // Spark spectra of higher order are also known . When two electrons are stripped from aluminum , the ion ( Al++ ) has the alkaline type of spectrum . The elements silicon , phosphorus , and sulphur have been stripped of all their valence electrons down to the alkaline state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , P++++ , and S+++++ are remarkably similar except that the spectrum is displaced further into the ultra-violet as the degree of ionization is increased . The wave length is shortened because of a change in the value of the series constant . The Rydberg constant is multiplied by 4 , 9 , 16 , etc. , according as the ion is singly , doubly , triply , etc. , charged . This is all in accord with the theory . Equation ( 25 ' ) shows that the energy of hydrogenlike orbits equals Z2Rh(1/n2) where Z represents the number of charges on the nucleus . The valence electron , as it is displaced into the various optical orbits in the normal atom , finds itself attracted by a single positive charge , since here the other electrons ( in the kernel ) are one less than the positive nuclear charges . The orbits are then like those of hydrogen . In Mg+ the valence electron is attracted by 2 charges ; the analogue is the spark spectrum of helium . Z is taken as 2 and the series constant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Z ) increases until , when in sulphur five of the six valence electrons are removed , the series constant is 25R . The shielding defect varies somewhat among the stripped atoms so that the energies of the levels are only rather roughly proportional to 1 , 4 , 16 , 25 . In illustration , the energies of the 1S levels ( in terms of ionization potentials ) for the sodium-like ions are shown in Table 35 . Similar results are found for elements in other rows of the periodic table . Ca+ resembles potassium ; Hg+ resembles gold . The spark spectrum of the alkalis is harder to obtain since this Involves disrupting the kernel itself . The first spark spectrum of the alkalis , of course , resembles the spectrum of the noble uses . Such relations as these show in a beautiful way the // fundamental unity of the chemical elements . In the periodic table the elements in a single vertical group have similar spectra , and elements in the same row in the table show even closer similarities when the elements are ionized so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the underlying unity which Prout suspected but could not prove . The familiar yellow doublet of sodium ( 125,1 ? 22P , , , O appears again and again in the spark spectra of the succeeding elements of the same row of the table . In sodium the wave lengths are 5890 , 5896 angstroms ; in Mg+ 2795 , 2802 angstroms ; in Al++ 1854 , 1862 angstroms ; in Si+++ 1394 , 1403 angstroms ; in P++++ 1118 , 1128 angstroms ; and in S+++++ 933 and 944 angstroms . ' So each of the other lines of sodium finds its corresponding lines in the spectra of these stripped atoms . A beautiful regularity of nature ! Fourth-power Law. ? The doublet interval increases as the fourth power of Z ? The same relation recurs among x-ray doublets ; this was indeed the clue which enabled the physicist to distinguish the spin doublets from the screening doublets . Stripped Atoms in the Stars. ? The scientist knows the nature of the gaseous atmosphere about the sun and other stars from their absorption spectra . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their normal states , as witness the spectrum of hydrogen and iron and the other normal arc spectra . A few easily ionized atoms ( like calcium ) show the spark spectrum . On hotter stars , stripped atoms , singly , doubly ionized become quite prominent . Indeed the astronomer has used the degree of ionization found in spectra as a temperature scale for the classification of stars . All of the valence electrons are removed at a temperature of a few hundred thousand degrees . But in the interior of the stars temperatures are much greater , running up to perhaps some 50 million degrees . Here all of the electrons even in the kernel itself may be stripped from the atom ? the atom reduced to the bare nucleus . Such a completely stripped atom may occupy a volume some ten thousand times less than the normal atom and the density of the star may be as much as 60,000 gm. per cubic // centimeter . Such an instance of a hot dwarf , tremendously heavy , is found in the celebrated companion of Sirius ( page 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about the nature of the exterior of the atom . Spectra usually contain multiplets ; the number of components in a multiplet term depends on the number of outer electrons in the atom . The way in which electron spin combines with the orbital motion . to give the total angular momentum ( inner quantum number j ) is indicated in the chapter . In every case the outer orbits are of the S , P , D , and F , etc. , type . In the first and second groups of the periodic table the 1S orbit ( never a multiplet ) is occupied ; the other orbits are virtual . The screening defects , due to imperfect shielding of the nucleus , are largest in the S and P type orbits , comparatively small in the I ) and F types ? these are " hydrogen-like . " In addition to the normal arc spectrum , attention is called to the " spark " spectrum , the spectrum appearing in stronger fields due to the atom which has sloughed off one or more of Ilie valence electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding elements in the atomic table . CHAPTER XVII ELECTRON COLLISIONS An atom resembles an egg : it is elastic unless it is hit too hard . Direct proof of energy levels . Step-by-step excitation of spectra . It is the method of physics , as of the other natural sciences , to invite critical tests of its theories . The physicist approaches his inquiry without prejudice ? he asks only for the truth . One sometimes hears of the " scientific method . " There is no method except observation , analysis , common sense , ingenuity , and perfect fairness . ( And unfortunately this " method " can not be learned by conversing about it . ) No theory is true until as far as possible it has been checked and cross checked and proved right Galva- in its every implication . Our detailed theory of spectra would not be accepted without the con- verging confirmation of many experiments . We now present some phenomena which seem to give the most direct confirmation of Bohr 's energy levels . ' The best proof of Planck 's theory would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best proof of Bohr 's postulated energy states would be to measure directly the energies of those states . This latter was done in a celebrated experiment by Franck and Hertz . Franck and Hertz were trying to measure ionization of gases . The apparatus which they used we should recognize today as an 214 // ordinary three-element radio tube . In Fig. 66 the plate P is to be considered at present as connected through the switch pf to the filament F. A dry cell keeps the potential of the plate slightly below that of the filament . Electrons leave the filament , are accelerated to the grid , and are retarded from the plate . Relative to the filament the grid is positive and the plate negative . No electron can reach the plate since its potential is lower than that of the filament ; the acceleration which the electron experiences in the region F-G is more than balanced by the deceleration in G-P . No electrons can reach the plate but any positive ions formed in the region G-P will be collected . The current to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube as this is used today to measure low gas pressures ( the ionization gage page 50 ) . current can be collected by P in perfect vacuum . The ionization current is a measure of the gas present . With such a tube Franck and Hertz attempted to measure t lie ionization potential of gases . They first tried mercury vapor . A drop of mercury placed in the tube produced the necessary vapor pressure . ' The potential on the grid was gradually raised and a very small ' positive current to the plate was detected when this grid voltage reached 4.9 volts . A much larger current was obtained at 10.4 volts . This is shown in the lower curve in Fig. 67 . When it has a velocity corresponding to a potential difference of 10.4 volts , the impinging electron can strike an elect run loose from the atom . It can ionize the atom with which it collides . Beginning at this voltage a positive-ion current is collected by the plate ( P ) . ( The small current beginning at 4.9 volts is ( Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases were similarly studied by Franck and Hertz and their successors . Typical values of ionizing potentials are given in Table 36 . Inelastic Collisions. ? In a variation of this experiment Franck and Hertz measured the energy losses suffered by electrons when they collide with a mercury atom . The connection is now made in Fig. 66 between p and g ; the plate P is now maintained by the cell 11 volts lower than the grid . As the potential of the grid is raised , the voltage of the plate will likewise be raised . The electrons will be accelerated in the region F-G and decelerated , but only slightly , in the region G-P . Electrons can now reach the plate P unless their velocity has been reduced by collision to less than VA e-volts . The current received by the plate in this experiment is negative . When the grid is raised to 11 volts , the plate voltage rises above zero , and electrons begin to be received by the plate . The current then increases , at 4.9 volts it falls , rises again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.8 volts and again at 14.7 volts ( Fig. 67 ) . Below 4.9 volts the collision of an electron with a mercury atom is elastic ; above that potential the electron can lose 4.9 e-volts of energy and , if the original energy of the electron was less than 6.4 volts , the residual energy after collision will be less than the 1/ volts required to reach the plate . The decrease of the current in this part of the curve is a measure of the number of electrons which have lost Iheir energy . An electron can use 1.9 (  --  volts in one collision , or 9.8 r-volts in Iwo inelastic collisions , Frequency , vibrations per subsecond // or 14.7 e-volts in three collisions . These experiments of Franck and Hertz showed two types of inelastic collisions : one the ionizing type requiring at least 10.4 volts in mercury , and one an excitation collision ' involving an energy loss of exactly 4.9 c ; volts . Values of excitation voltage for several other elements are given in Table 36 . Single-line Spectrum. ? But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that the complete arc spectrum of mercury appeared at 10.4 volts . Below that voltage and above 1.9 volts they observed the single line X2537 ! Below 4.9 volts nothing . Thus this single-line spectrum of mercury was correllated with this 4.9-volt energy loss . The Test of the Bohr Theory. ? This was in 1914 . These discoveries with galvanometer and spectrometer came very happily for the newly proposed theory of Bohr . The newly horn theory furnished an exact explanation of these experimental results . 1 . Ionization. ? We have shown in Tables 31 and 33 the vibration numbers of the more important virtual orbits of mercury . The electron is normally in the 1'So state . The limit of the principal series of mercury has a frequency of 252.5 vibrations per subsecond . This corresponds to an energy quantum of 1000 atomic ergs . Such is the energy of the quantum of light given out when an electron falls into this orbit from the periphery of the atom ; such is the energy which must be acquired o remove the electron to the periphery . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 electron-volt ) , an electron traveling with 10.4 volts should be able to ionize the atom . This is in exact agreement with Franck and Hertz . 2 . Inelastic Collisions. ? Next beyond the 1'So base level come the ri plet levels ; 23P2,1 , oro . But a free transition to the base Ie el , emitting light , can occur only from the 23 level ( page 204 ) . Mils single transition , in the reverse sense , also occurs in absorption . ) The line emitted ( 1'So ? 23 ) has a wave length 2537 angstroms , and a frequency 118 vibrations per subsecond . In the inelastic collision observed by Franck and Hertz the valance electron in mercury was displaced to this 23 level ; the line 2537 angst nulls , and this alone , appeared in the spectrum lit 4.9 volts . The photon of this 2537 line has an energy of 470 // atomic ergs or 4.9 electron-volts . Again an exact agreement between theory and experiment . If V , , represents the critical potential for inelastic collision and v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct measurement of the energy in a single quantum of radiated energy , shows definitely the existence of energy states , and is the clearest demonstration of the reality of Planck 's quantum of energy ( hv ) . .. The small positive current which Franck and Hertz observed coming to their plate at 4.9 volts ( Fig. 67 , lower curve ) is due to the photoelectric effect . The line X2537 coming in at this volt age excites the plate photoelectrically . The electrons leaving the plate produce the positive current which Franck and Hertz at first attributed to positive ions . Step-by-step Excitation of Spectra. ? But why ( it may well be asked ) only this single line ( X2537 ) below the ionizing potential ? Others asked this question but not for a decade was the question answered . It was then shown that in fact each line of the spectrum appears below ionization as soon as the voltage is sufficient to displace the valence electron to the appropriate outer level . Above 6.7 volts the electron may be displaced // to the 21P level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so far in the ultra-violet that it is not usually observed . ) Above 7.9 volts the electron can be displaced to the 2S levels ( either 21S or 23S ) ? lines of the sharp series appear . Above 8.8 volts the first lines of the diffuse series appear . The spectrograms in Fig. 68 show the step-by-step excitation of this spectrum . All this is an exact confirmation of the Bohr energy levels . The Scientist at Work. ? In the earlier chapters the successive scenes of our panorama have passed quickly before our view . We have hardly had time to see the men who have done these things . Yet there is hardly a page of this book the writing of which has not cost the labors of many men ? many men perhaps for years . There is no fascination in the bare picture of this atomic world ; the fascination is in the memories associated with each detail , memories of failure and of success . It is all an entrancing story of the solving of mystery . The men who do these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventors or public benefactors or wizards perhaps they are prophets but , most generally , they are artists . They enjoy an unexplained phenomenon as Sherlock Holmes enjoyed a clever crime and often care no more , I suspect , for " progress " then he did for " law and order . " But out of their work has come , for better or worse , the basis of our modern civilization . Let us pause here and see the physicist at work . Let us see how this art of measuring critical potentials gradually developed . A decade or so before Franck and Hertz , Lenard ( like J. J. Thomson a great pioneer in electronics ) first measured the ionizing potentials of gases . He was before his time ; his results %%ere bare facts without theoretical setting . Men can not digestery much of such . Theory or a law of nature or an atomic model call it what you will acts as a cement , binding apparently unrelated parts together . Hence the peculiar beauty of physics ; each of the truths of physics forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lenard 's results were just brutal unalleviated facts . Incomplete , suggestive , they were buried in the files of the Annalcn der Phylik . But his method of : it tack lived on ; it was his method which was used by Franck and Hertz in 1911 . They were looking // for ionizing potentials just as Lenard had been before them ; they stumbled upon resonance potentials and , of course , did not recognize them at first . But now in 1914 there was a theory to guide and direct the experimenter . Before long , Franck and Hertz recognized the 4.9-volt collision in mercury as an inelastic collision . Very opportune was all of this for the new Bohr theory and vice versa . Others followed this trail . War halted science in Europe ; American scientists came to the front . Other gases were studied , particularly the metal vapors . Then diatomic gases were investigated more complicated results now , since dissociation of the molecule must first occur before the simple energy states of the atom appear . Hydrogen was investigated in vacuum furnaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules were mostly dissociated . Its 13.5-volt ionizing potential , its 10-volt resonance potential was observed ? also at lower temperatures the energy states of the hydrogen molecule . Just after the war American , German , English physicists , united in the common task , produced a wealth of quantitative confirmation of the objective reality of the Bohr energy states . In all of this earlier work on electron collisions very little that was really new developed . Time after time the predictions of the Bohr theory were confirmed . These energy levels can , granting the theory , be more accurately computed from spectroscopic data than by such direct measurement . But these experiments with resonance potentials strengthened this platform upon which future physics was to build . Much in the Bohr theory is superfluous , some inconsistent ; but these energy levels certainly exist . Only by having a prodigality of proof , by having support from every side , by the cumulative support of a great quantity of detail does a theory become a fact , established forever . Such a fact is , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a fact is , I believe , the existence of energy levels in atoms . This is the meaning of all of those papers on critical potentials which a decade ago appeared in our Physical Review and in the English Proceedings of the Philosophical Society and in the Zeitschift fur Physik . They were building up truth . The investigations of these electron collisions have been very extensive . We have mentioned only the most element:try question : how much energy is lost ? Other questions which have // been studied extensively are the nature of the scattering of electrons when they collide with atoms , the nature of collision producing multiple ionization and " spark lines , " and ionization by collision of positive ions . Sometimes an already excited atom strikes another particle ; instead of absorbing energy from the particle it may then give energy up to it . This is called a collision of the second kind . All these experiments are fascinating because of the directness of the interpretations we can usually make . They have contributed greatly to our understanding of atomic and molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in this chapter present more from the wealth of experimentation in this field . The Ionizing Potentials of the Atoms. ? From spectroscopy the energies of the normal states of the atom have been determined . In many cases the results have been confirmed by the electrical methods just described . These results are summarized in Vig. ( i9 . Perhaps this summary of the binding force of the valence electrons in the different atoms represents the most notable single result of spectroscopy . The weak binding in the alkalis , t he strong binding in the halogens and in the completed rare-gas shells , this explains to us the fundamental chemical differences of these elements . Now we see what is meant by the alkalis , the electron losers , and halogens , the electron capturers . Minor periodicities are shown in the figure . But at present we need notice only the increasing affinity for electrons as we go from light to heavy element within any period , the similarity of potentials among the transition elements of the long periods , and , t1s between elements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of the element . CHAPTER XVIII IN A MAGNETIC FIELD The atom is a magnet and the magnet is a gyroscope . In a magnetic field everything is one large merry-go-round . But only quantized orientations occur : proof , the Zeeman effect . Thus is completed our description of quantum state . Nuclear spin and fine structure . Magnetic Moment and Mechanical Moment. ? The electron moving about its orbit acts as an electric current ; in consequence , except when j is zero , the atom acts as a small electromagnet . This electric current bounds a magnetic shell and the magnetic moment ( M ) of this shell is 2e-r . This is the strength of this atomic magnet . ' But also , in virtue of the mass of the revolving electron , the atom acts as a small flywheel . Its angular momentum ( J ) is , as we know , mvr . The ratio of the magnetic moment to this // mechanical moment is therefore 2c m ' For an electron this ratio M/J is about % ( exactly 0.113 ) .1 This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in an orbit . When a charged mass is spinning on its own axis , the distribution of charge and mass at varied distances from the center must be considered and the problem is somewhat altered . For the spin of the electron the ratio of magnetic to mechanical moment M/J is e/mc . This fundamental difference between the orbital and spin motions introduces a complication ; to avoid this , let us at present consider only cases ( such as the singlet states ) where the spin may be l ieglected . The Gyrating Atom. ? Despite the magnetic force , these atomic magnets when free ( as in a gas ) can not turn themselves parallel to the magnetic field . Because of its rotating mass , each atom must act as a gyroscope and precess about the direction of the magnetic field ( II ) . If its axis of rotation is oblique to the field , that axis turns about , keeping the same obliquity , like the precession of a top . If its axis is parallel to the field , the orbital motion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case is ? 6H radians per subsecond . Larmor Precession. ? This is but a special case of a general principle . A magnetic field causes the paths of all moving electrons to precess slowly . We have seen in Fig. 40 the straight path of the cathode ray twisted through several degrees . An oscillating electron in a magnetic field finds its line of vibration gradually rotated . And now we find that a charge revolving in Is orbit , acts like a gyroscope , the axis of revolution precessing In the magnetic field . The paths of all electrons are turned about the magnetic field as if the world were one large merry-go-round. // This general rotary motion induced by the magnetic field is called the " Larmor precession . " The angular velocity of this general precession is ' radians per subsecond or revolutions per subsecond ( 31 ) In a field ( impracticably great ) of 1 atomic unit the frequency is 1/2rr X 0.113 , or 0.018 per subs e c o n d . I n a field of 1 gauss ( 1/128,500th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 7 million subseconds ; or , in other words , its frequency of precession is 1.4 X 10 ' J revolutions per second.2 Depolarization of Resonance Radiation in a Magnetic Field. ? A beautiful illustration of this Larmor precession is found in an experiment performed by Wood and Ellett . The resonance line of mercury ( X2537 ) was first polarized and then entered a tube containing mercury vapor . The clas sical picture of the atom can be used bit in magnetic sold . The m to explain the broader aspects of the observed phenomenon . We can think of the atom as a tuned oscillator , a million per second with a minute radio station . This atomic oscillator would absorb the polarized light , would oscillate in the plane of polarization , and later would reemit light polarized in the same plane . This is substantially // what Wood and Ellett found when the experiment was performed without a magnetic field . ' But when a magnetic field was applied to the resonance tube the secondary light could be completely depolarized . In this magnetic field the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of reemission . Only a gauss or two was required to nearly depolarize the secondary emission . Ellett has used the method to determine the mean life of the excited state of the atom . He finds that for mercury this excited life is 10 ? 7 sec . During that time a field of 1 gauss would rotate the plane of polarization through one-seventh of a revolution ? enough to give considerable reduction in polarization ; 2 gauss would cause a precession of more than 90 ? and completely depolarize the light . The Element of Magnetism. ? Let us consider singlet states , where the spin of the electron can be neglected . In earlier chapters it has been shown that the angular momentum of the atom is equal to jh . It ( i.e. , h/27r or 0.632 atomic unit ) is Nature 's unit of angular momentum . This natural unit of angular momentum we may call ( inventing the name ) a Bohr " momentum . " The electron ( without spin ) having mechanical moment of j momentous acts as a magnet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnetic moment and is called the Bohr magnet on . The magneton is practically one-fourteenth of an atomic unit . This natural element of magnetism is usually represented by , u.
