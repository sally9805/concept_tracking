txt Proportional Taxes Urged . To the Editor of The New York Times : Samuel Untermyer 's suggestion of a $15 automobile tax as a revenue measure is important primarily as a demonstration of a certain type of public - mindedness . Anatole France in a different connection expressed it somewhat when he observed that the law with majestic impartiality does not allow millionaires nor beggars to sleep on park benches . The character of this feeling of civio responhibility is ostensibly nonpartisan . It is manifestly free from the stigma of special pleading . It attempts to shield no special interests . But a further casual explanation of it reveals an appalling breach in the logic of its argument . The city 's finances are in bad shape . Something must be done . A $15 tax on the $5,000 and the $50 second-hand car will partially solve it . Perhaps it will . But this procedure falls short of the idea of taxation in a democracy . Why not a proportionate ad valorem tax ? One is inclined to accept Mr. Untermyer 's , roposal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $5,000 car owners . RICHARD STERN . New " York , May 31 , 1933.
