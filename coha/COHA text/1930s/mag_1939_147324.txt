During the last three months of her pregnancy , pious , 24-year-old Mrs. Esperanza Sacramenta Rafael of Manila lay in bed gazing at a chromo of Christ pointing to his exposed , bleeding heart . Last fortnight , in a small hospital in the Tondo slum district , Mrs. Rafael gave birth to a seven-pound baby girl , named Maria Corazon ( Mary Heart ) . The baby 's heart , faintly beating , lay on her chest , outside her body . Mrs. Rafael 's friends , who thronged to the hospital , stoutly maintained that the baby 's condition was due to Mrs. Rafael 's daily adoration of the Sacred Heart . <P> The exposed heart was a case of rare ectopia cordis , of which 28 cases have been recorded since 1706 . The deformity may be caused by failure of embryonic chest cells to fuse in the middle . Since Maria 's heart was unprotected by a membrane , Dr. Guillermo del Castillo carefully covered it with a thin stemless cocktail glass , and placed the baby , who was otherwise normal , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nurses , swallowed milk through an eyedropper . Her heart beat regularly , and when she cried it bounced up &; down on her chest like a tiny red rubber ball . Dr. Jesus Celius of the University of Santo Tomas refused to consider an operation to place her heart inside her chest . Reason : its aorta ( main artery ) would have to be shut off during the operation . Last week , after living seven days , little Maria Corazon died of pneumonia .
