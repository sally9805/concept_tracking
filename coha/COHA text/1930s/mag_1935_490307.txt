AWIRIGUOUS RECOVERY NOTE : The first full carload of horseshoe nails sold into New York City in over a quarter of a century arrived at the Deshrosses Street freight station the other afternoon . The firm that bought them would n't tell us whether they were going to be used for fastening new shoes on horses or for nailing up old shoes above doorways . AGENTLEMAN named Dr. Ry- an has been making a study of " auto fatigue " with the idea of showing how automobile design affects it . He has probably not taken into consideration , however , how tired it makes us , sometimes , just to look at certain types of cars , before we ever crawl into them . That should come under " auto fatigue . " Another thing he ought to study is the fatigue of the bones of a man 's hands , caused by hanging onto the modern steering-wheel , which , being designed for Lady midgets , is so skinny that when a man keeps his fingers wrapped around it for ten hours at a stretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he goes and gets a couple of dead teeth pulled out . CONOMISTS have been diligent , - LL4 almost violent , in pointing out that our frontier has vanished . In the main we do not dispute their findings ; but the frontier , although pretty well shot , is perhaps not entirely gone . Quite a while after the 1933 Chicago Fair had shut up shop , somebody wandered back in a reminiscent mood and found , lingering on there , a little hand of redmen left over from the attraction known as the Indian Village . With no carfare home , these Indians were encamped on the lakeshore and were living on fish caught with primitive tackle . Old frontiers are pushed hack , new ones rise . It is worth noting that our century of progress ended much as it began : with an Indian trying to spear a fish . AYOUNG couple we know are in the clutches of an Irish terrier . The animal , a young male , is fairly decent around the apartment except for one eccentricity : he wo n't let even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abercrombie cushion much in vogue among degenerate city canines . He quietly but firmly offers to tear to pieces anybody who so much as reaches out a hand toward this bed . The husband of the family , who likes to think of himself in a general way as the dog 's master , is fed up with this treacherous performance and is ready to give the pup the beating of his life ; but the lady of the house , who has read more books and things , has decided that the bed has a sexual fascination for the dog because it had once been occupied by a female terrier who presumably left a few hairpins and powder around . She says you ca n't blame a dog for defending what to him is the very symbol of femininity . Nevertheless , the situation is a bad one ; every move either one of them makes to touch the bed , either for sanitary or purely whimsical or experimental reasons , is met by a savagery almost unbelievable in Man 's Best Friend . The husband 's temper is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unnatural enough without the added complication of a dog who is in love with his own bed . THE editor of Writer 's Digest has received a letter from Simon Pearle , warden of the Arkansas State Institute for the Demented , asking him to discontinue the subscription of one of the inmates . " After reading a copy , " the warden explained , " he becomes violently morose . " This is an aspect of publishing which we know something about . Quite a number of our readers grow violently morose after reading a copy , but in our case , instead of our receiving a letter from the friends or wardens of these readers , we get letters direct from the readers themselves . That 's the form their violence takes . Sometimes we wonder why they go on buying the magazine , knowing as they do the effect it 's going to have on them . It 's like a man continuing to drink after he knows that it 's going to make him terrible . OCCASIONALLY , in Country places , along the pike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , in Virginia , we saw camels pass by night , the road lit by flares . Remembering how we felt on that occasion , we envy the man who happened to be sitting alongside the road near Hollidaysburg , Pa. , not so long ago , when there came along six large green buses plainly labelled " Madison-Fourth Avenue . " They were new and they were shiny , and they were headed with great singleness of purpose in the direction of New York . Havoc AN undergraduate . from Princeton ? / a senior he is , too spent last weekend in town . Sunday morning he slept away , and then rushed out for a couple of afternoon visits . When he got back to his hotel that evening and asked for his key , he was astonished to he told by the clerk in lugubrious tones that something regrettable had occurred . Would lie mind stepping into the office ? There he was informed that during the day his room had been entered and rifled ; the chambermaid had found it in a terrific state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return before touching anything and would appreciate it if he 'd go up now with the house detective and make out a list of what was missing . The young scholar went up with the detective , and when he saw the room realized it was unquestionably in a state of sad disorder . It looked familiar , however , and a check revealed no objects gone  --  everything exactly as he 'd left it , in fact . Model Receivership WE 'VE had it straight , from several men who ought to know , that the President still does n't do anything important without the counsel of Raymond Moley , although Mr. Moley no longer has any connection with the administration . This led us to wonder how Mr. Moley has been making out in a little chore of his here , running the Hotel St. Regis , which he 's been doing since last June , when he was appointed receiver of the property pending the outcome of litigation between Vincent Astor and the Duke Estate . Mr. Moley , we find upon investigation , is very active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , living right in the St. Regis , in a sixteenth-floor suite with a grand piano in it and a photograph inscribed " To Ray Moley , one of the best ' hombres ' I 've ever known . With love , John Garner . " He holds conferences almost daily with Mr. Emil Ronay , manager of the hotel . All the St. Regis licences  --  liquor , cabaret laundry , restaurant , and whatnot  --  of the St. Regis , whom Mr. Moley got back when he took charge . No detail is too minute for a MoleyRonay huddle . One of their first decisions was to put a fresh red rose in a finger vase on every breakfast tray . The receiver does n't have his breakfast on a tray , though , but in the thirty . dining-room every morning at sevenWhoever gets the decision from the Court of Appeals will find everything well under control at the St. Regis . Mr. Moley has said frankly that he 's out to make this a model receivership . When he gives the court an account-ing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re-gis was only forty per cent occupied last June ; now it 's eighty per cent . Finances have been kept on a self-re-specting basis : no big discounts , no due bills , no reduction in prices . Though a receiver is supposed to be a " conserver of assets during the period of litiga-tion , " he 's usually anything but that , according to Mr. Moley , because he has to pay politically for his appoint-ment with contracts and fat payrolls . Mr. Maley declared that he has no political debts and was determined to make a clean job of it . There was an-other reason , too . " People used to ask about Brain Trusters , " Mr. Moley re-marked . " Who they are , what ' they 've done . Well , I thought taking a proper-ty like this and turning it from a losing into a paying proposition would he an answer to them . " The New Deal at the St. Regis included a twen-ty-five-per-cent cut in the payroll , 2nd a decision to keep the Roof open this winter and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moley and Ronay have tried out a couple of orchestras since Lopez left . Johnny Green 's is there at this writing . The New Deal marches on , it seems , for Johnny Green is a Harvard man . Mr. Moley expects to be out of the hotel business by March 1st , or maybe sooner . He 'll still be a very busy man , though , for he edits Today , lectures Tuesdays and Thursdays at Barnard and Columbia , and goes frequently to Washington . He 's going to keep right on living at the St. Regis , though , and this makes Mr. Ronay proud . The receiver is scrupulous about paying for everything he gets personally ? suite , meals , and even stray cocktails and cigars . Mr. Ronay often tells Mr. Moley that he leans over backward in paying for some things that ought to he charged to expenses , but Mr. Maley laughs and remarks that Mr. Ronay never had all the Republican newspapers after him . Pop Goes Warburton AN admirer of William John War- burton writes in asking us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking in an emergency . Mr. Warburton , he tells us , is an aviator , a stockbroker , a prominent clubman , and a baritone . He made his radio &but; a short time ago ( in the last-named capacity , we suppose , although our correspondent does n't make it plain ) , the occasion being the first broadcast of a periodic feature called " Champagne Cocktails . " The program was to be started off with a loud , chainpagny pop . This sound effect was entrusted to the hull fiddler in Emil Coleman 's orchestra , who was to pull a cork out of a gin bottle . Well , about ten seconds before the zero hour , he dropped the bottle . Everybody in the studio  --  radio executives , sponsors , and friends of Mr. Warburton  --  stared helplessly at the pieces . Nobody could think of anything to do  --  nobody but Mr. Warburton , that is . Just as the red light went on , indicating that they were on the air , he stepped to the microphone , put his finger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop . Toot ! Toot ! BYno means all the whistles you hear blowing in the harbor during foggy periods ( gentlemen , we give you last week ) are on vessels . Many of them are attached to docks , piers , and other structures which , though stationary , are in considerable danger of being run into . Some of these whistles are automatic , and are actuated by as simple an object as  --  you 'd never have thought it  --  a strand of pig 's bristle . This , in some occult way , " feels " the fog as it conies a-roll- ? rig in , establishes contact with an electrical mechanism , and whoa-o-o-o , the foghorn starts  --  and you , if you live anywhere downtown , begin thinking of ships groping in the haze , lonely mariners , and so on . The foghorns , of course , send out only a routine warning . The rest of the medley of tootings you hear does come from vessels , speaking to each other as they sidle past . This they do by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short blasts from a steamer 's whistle , it means that somewhere out in the fog a ship 's officer is signalling " I am directing my course to port . " Usually , you 'll hear another whistle toot twice soon after . This means that the vessel he 's approaching has caught the signal and is acting accordingly . If it had n't understood , it would have given four quick toots , and he would have had to repeat his signal . One short blast means a ship intends to pass to starboard . If you hear three short blasts , it means " My engines are going at full speed astern and look out for a crash . " Two long blasts repeated at intervals of two minutes indicate a ship at . anchor ; one means she 's under way . One long arid two short mean a vessel is towing ; you hear that pretty often in the harbor from tugboats , hauling their strings of lighters around . Tugboats , by the way , and all vessels towing others , have to carry extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each vessel towed , strung down in a row from the masthead , below the running lights . The big aristocratic liners , of course , go in for very fancy whistles , often having several , each made especially , according to pet theories of line officials , and costing up in the hundreds of dollars . The Leviathan , for example , is equipped with three , one on each funnel and costing about three hundred dollars apiece . Most Cunarders have two : steam whistles of regular design , with a fixed pitch . The French Line , on the other hand , goes in for steam sirens , which slide up the scale as they blow  --  thinks they carry farther . The ile-deFrance has three of these . The Bremen has the most whistles of anybody : five , including a thing called a " nauto phone , " which is something like a giant loudspeaker , only it whistles . They use it in fog . The only time the Bremen gets any real fun out of its five whistles , though , is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they let loose with all of them simultaneously in three prolonged blasts : their rough way of saying " Aloha , " or " Farewell . " They never do that on this side , however . Afraid the West Side folk would n't understand . If Wishes Were Taxis " A WOMAN gits into my cab yes- tiddy , " our taxi-driver told us , " and gives me a numba in East Sixtysecon ' Street , see ? " We said we saw . " I takes her to the numba  --  a brownstone it was  --  and she ai n't got no money , understand ? " We said we understood . " Looks in her purse but ai n't got no money . Well , she goes up and ringsa bell but ai n't nobody home , so she comes hack and is about to hand me a spiel when she sees this old beggar comin ' along the street  --  guy that vialhks that neighborhood , get it ? " We said we got it . " Son-of-a-gun if she do n't up to this guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew her all right , guess mehhe she 'd handed him a dime now and then . Anyway , she gits the sixty-five cents and gives it to me , fifty-five and a dime tip . ' I 'll return it to you tomorrow , ' she tells the guy . ' God bless you , lady , ' he says , and goes on . Yell . Well , ya see some funny things , do n't ye ? " We said ya did . Case of Yetta FOR the greatest good of the greatest number , weekly shower baths are compulsory in some of the public schools , those situated in districts with a low bathtub census . There are n't many objections , once the idea gets over , and some of the children even come to like the showers . Now and then , of course , there is a snag . A teacher in one of the bath schools ran into a snag the other day  --  a snag of the name of Mrs. Goldstein , a parent . Mrs. Goldstein wrote a letter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which read : " Out the house for a shower for my daughter I will absolutely forbid . " She went on : " My daughter Yetta Goldstein is got a cold . Besides , my son Benjamin of the same school now with the grip and myself the mother of the children now with the grip and fever . I appeal to you , My Dear Teacher , not to permit her to take a shower on Fridays . Diphtheria and scarlet fever is now advancing in the thousands . In case this wo n't stop , I will have to get off . the bed even it should cost my life to protect my children , which is all I live for . So please do not send my Daughter to take a shower bath in school . It is good for Summer , not for Winte r . " Whether Yetta got an exemption we do n't know . Immaterial THIS happened last February , and we would n't have heard of it even now if the cold weather had n't reminded a lawyer to tell about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a divorce obtained in Florida was being tried in the Supreme Court here , and the attorney for one of the contestants was caught unprepared because the judge had denied him a continuance when the trial was called . His case depended , he felt , on the expert testimony of a Florida lawyer as to certain divorce technicalities in question . Having failed to get a postponement , the attorney did the next best thing : telegraphed his expert in Florida to get to New York as quick as he could by plane . The expert landed here next day , in the midst of a blizzard . He 'd left Miami in a great hurry , still wearing a white linen suit and a Panama hat . He was met at the landing field by the New York lawyer 's clerks , enfolded in an extra overcoat they had brought , and rushed to the courtroom . He was put on the stand immediately , the New York lawyer hastily excusing a witness he had succeeded in stalling along with fur an hour or two . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the Florida divorce . ' Witness took a deep breath , and was about to render his opinion when the opposing lawyer spoke up . " I object , " he said , " on the ground that it is immaterial . " " Objection sustained , " His Honor said . There was some little argument after this , but in the end the New York lawyer told his witness to step down . Witness stepped down , never having uttered a word , put on his Panama hat , and flew hack to Florida . Whistler 's Murder LL OTS of people think that Qucena Mario is Italian , but she is n't . The Metropolitan Opera soprano was horn Queena Marion Tillotson , her father being Scotch-American and her mother Greek . Her last name now is French , for she married Wilfred Pelletier , one of the Metropolitan conductors , ten years ago . Queena crept up on the Opera House here by way of Akron , Ohio , and Plainfield , New Jersey . Her progress was interesting . The late James K. Tillotson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War . He lived to see two plays of his produced with success on Broadway , " The Planter 's Wife " and " Report for Duty , " but he missed his daughter 's rise to fame , because she was only thirteen when he died . Queena , however , had been singing at the Metropolitan for two years when her mother died , in 1924 . There are five other children ; none of them sing , but all of them play the piano a little . The family moved from Akron to Plainfield in 1906 , and in the panic a year later lost all its money . Queena came to New York and began writing columns for newspapers , the Telegram , Evening World , Sun , etc . Under the name of Queena Tillotson , she wrote " Chats with Personalities " and " Looking on the Sunny Side of Life ; " under the name of Florence Bryan , she wrote " Talks About Your Children . " She did n't save a single clipping , but she did save her money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had her first audition at the Metropolitan , but she was turned down . Then she began to study with Marcella Sembrich , and in 1918 she was given another audition , with the same result . But she was n't discouraged , and took her voice to Fortune Gallo , head of the San Carlo Opera Company . Gallo could n't make up his mind about her , so he asked Carus() to listen to her . Caruso was charmed and advised Gallo to sign her up . When Gallo still hesitated , Caruso roared at him that he , Caruso , would pay her salary for one season if she was a flop . Queena 's first operatic appearance was in New York in November , 1918 , as Juliet in the San Carlo 's " Romeo and Juliet . " She made good , and sang with the company for three years . In 1921 , she went with Scotti 's San Francisco Opera Company , and word of her work got back to Gatti . He gave her her third Metropolitan audition , and on Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She has been with the Metropolitan ever since . Queena still studies conscientiously , and also does a lot of teaching herself . Among her pupils are Rose Bampton , now a Metropolitan star in her own right , and Helen Jepson , who will make her &but; in the new American opera " In a Pasha 's Garden " on January 24th . Queena Mario always learns new roles by whistling them first ( she has a repertoire of forty-five altogether , in four languages ) . She never sings a note until she can whistle the entire part accurately . She never heard of any other singer who does this and she does n't encourage it in her pupils , but it suits her fine because it saves her voice . A few weeks ago a murder mystery called " Murder in the Opera House " came out , under the name of Queena Mario . It 's the same Queena Mario . The story centres around a Metropolitan performance of " I Pagliacci , " and they say you can pull a thin veil from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pretty good mystery book , we hear , and has sold well . Queena gave a copy to most of the Metropolitan people , past and present , but does n't know for sure that any of them read it except Sembrich . She read it at one sitting , staying up till two-thirty to do so . Outside of writing ( and singing , of course ) , the soprano 's chief interest is penguin-collecting . She has her living-room full of penguins , all sizes and materials and always in pairs . No live ones , of course ; live penOmins do n't like whistling . Warning Tr is reported to us by a woman of no great size that she was heading south on Sixth Avenue , just below Forty-second Street , the other day when she perceived a very large man moving north by a series of short , abrupt tacks from the curb to the stoop line and back again . When a collision appeared imminent , she sidestepped to her right . The large man sidestepped to his left . She stepped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and there they were in the same relative position , and getting closer all the time . As she was on the point of deciding there was nothing for it but to turn and go around the block , the man stopped . He planted his feet wide apart to steady himself , looked straight at her , and said , " Little one , if you ca n't carry it any better than that , you better cut it out . "
