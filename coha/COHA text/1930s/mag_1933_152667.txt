Many a Connecticut woman packed up a rod &; reel and repaired to a three-mile stretch of Branford River near New Haven , when the State trout season opened one day last week . Few of them minded much when they tangled their lines in trees and bushes , whipped their hooks into each others ' clothes , got their wading boots waterlogged . They were happy because at last they had a chance to learn how to fish with no impatient male anglers standing by to criticize , complain , show off . Any husbands or fathers who went along had to sit meekly inactive on the banks . This was a stream for women only . <P> The fisherwomen had Publisher Thomas Hambly Beck , president of P. F. Collier &; Son Co. , to thank for their fun . He calls fishing " my golf , " serves as chairman of Connecticut 's State Board of Fisheries &; Game . When he heard last year about the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries ' trout stream for women in North Carolina 's Pisgah National Forest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same privilege . Property-owners along the chosen three miles of Branford River helped him by leasing fishing rights to the State without charge . He had the stream well stocked with gamey brook trout . <P> Only requirement for use of the stream is a State fishing license . Women who are squeamish about handling worms will not be sorry that fly fishing alone is permitted . On hand to teach them the art is a State warden of their own sex . She is Edith A. Stoeher , 27 , a husky , genial sportswoman who breeds English setters on her farm near South Wethersfield , likes to hunt , fish , trapshoot . Last fortnight , in a field test with four other applicants for the job , she proved her skill with rod &; reel , her knowledge of flies , knots , trout . Publisher Beck expects her to turn out many a woman angler able to whip Connecticut 's 32 State-leased trout streams with the best of men .                  @ @ @
