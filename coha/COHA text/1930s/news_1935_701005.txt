txt Venus and Orion . May I can to the attention of those of your readers who are interested in the glories of the heavens the planet Venus , which is once again an evening star , visible low in the western sky for perhaps an hour after sunset ? Venus is the brightest object in the heavens with the exception of the sun and the moon . She is moving eastward and her brilliance increases as she approaches the earth in her elliptical orbit around the sun , which orbit lies within the celestial highway of our own planet . It would appear that she has a heavenly tryst with the ' mighty hunter Orion . He is the dominant feature of the present Winter sky and passes the meridian about 9 o'clock , being Well up in the southeastern sky at sunset . Hie decline in the west well marks the passing of Winter and her coming signifies the advent of Spring . E. ALLAIRE- CORNWELL . Red Bank , N. J. , Feb. 1 , 1935.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
