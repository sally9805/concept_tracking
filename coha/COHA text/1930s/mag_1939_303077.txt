For years U. S. airlines have known a lot about passenger discomfort at not unusual flying altitudes between 10,000 and 15,000 feet . But they have done little to allay it beyond providing 105-lb. registered nurses , and handy cardboard containers . <P> Last week Northwest Airlines got practical about the problem , announced that it was installing plane oxygen systems which will : 1 ) cure airsickness , 2 ) prevent heart palpi tation and hard breathing at high altitudes , 3 ) make flying comfortable at cruising levels up to 30,000 feet , 4 ) prevent the painful sensation of having one 's ears stopped up in descents from flights . <P> Northwest chose the light-weight ( 4 oz. ) , nose-gripping oxygen masks invented by grey-haired Dr. Walter Meredith Boothby and two other doctors of the Mayo Clinic and already used to cure and prevent seasickness ( TIME , Jan. 16 ) . Last week , after demonstrating the oxygen sys tem in an overweather flight of four hours and 50 minutes from Minneapolis to Boston with nine passengers , Chief Pilot Mai Freeburg showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and newsmen . <P> Passengers with hangovers became clear headed when they began breathing a mix ture of 20% oxygen , 80% nitrogen . Others became violently airsick when they took off their masks , quickly recovered when they put them on again . All showed normal pulse and respiration rates , were able to eat comfortably without taking off the masks . <P> Before the plane began descending at 1,000 feet per minute ( normal airline descent rate 300 f.p.m. ) , the passengers ' masks were piped to a mixture of 20% oxygen , 80% helium and they experienced no ear pains . Passengers were told that ear plugging was due to failure of the ears to equalize inner and outer pressure in descent , that highly diffusible helium spreads more swiftly than air through the passages from nose to ears , keeps pressure reasonably even .
