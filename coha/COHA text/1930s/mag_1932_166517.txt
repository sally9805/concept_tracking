It looked last week as though the Federal Reserve Board had given a dose of salts to a country with a broken leg . The volumes of excess credit ( about $300,000,000 worth ) which the Reserve had quietly been piling up since February by increasing its weekly purchases of Government bonds ( TIME , April 25 ) still lay idle . Observing this , the Board lowered its purchases of Government bonds from around $100,000,000 a week to $58,000,000 , and awaited developments . <P> Secretary of the Treasury Mills and Governor Meyer of the Reserve Board went out to Chicago to do there what had been done the week prior in Manhattan-set up a new committee to find channels through which the new credit could be pumped out to " reflate " trade &; finance . On the committee , besides leading bankers , were such potent Chicago industrialists as President Alexander Legge of International Harvester Co. ; President David A. Crawford of Pullman Co. ; Chairman James Simpson of Marshall Field &; Co. ; Charles Glore of Field , Glore &; Co. ; President Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman was Sewell Lee Avery , able president of U. S. Gypsum Co. and of Montgomery Ward . " I have no magic in my briefcase and no rabbit in my hat , " said Secretary Mills . The first week 's experience of the new Manhattan committee suggested that other hats and briefcases were in like condition . <P> The Manhattan committee of twelve , chairmanned by Owen D. Young and promptly christened the Apostles , pondered long one afternoon and then announced that it had " discussed questions of fiscal legislation and their bearing upon things that the committee might itself recommend . " <P> This was , of course , pointing a polite finger at Congress . All week the Senate had haggled over the tax bill ( see p. 12 ) . All week the prospect of balancing the Budget had remained hazy . Day by day it was increasingly apparent that until Congress acted on the Budget and showed signs of adjourning , Business &; Finance must remain hesitant . The committee had to agree with the banking community that it would be folly to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balanced Budget . <P> Not only Business &; Finance were disturbed by Congress ' behavior . Europe began increasing its withdrawals of gold . Exports last week came to $70,000,000 , making the total for the past six weeks about $280,000,000 . Although bankers knew that the Federal Reserve could lose some $1,200,000.000 in gold before reaching the legal minimum they became afraid that the continued alarm might increase the flow , start a real " flight from the dollar . " Likewise they were afraid that it would renew hoarding . <P> Miniscule . One direct accomplishment of Mr. Young 's committee was to help small home-owners refinance mortgages and finance repairs . This was done by promising the Savings &; Loan Bank of the State of New York that leading banks would buy bonds from it whenever the funds were needed to be reloaned to member associations which in turn would pass them on to sound and worthy homeowners . The amount to be so used may run to $5,000,000-a miniscule portion of the funds on hand , far too small to reflate business or unfreeze New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
