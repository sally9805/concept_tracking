txt Substantial Brazilian purchases of locomotives and railroad equipment in the United States are a probability , it was learned last night . Orders , previously destined for German plants . may be rerouted to American manufacturers as a result of the recent severance of commercial relations between the South American republic and the Reich . The purchases under negotiation involve a very considerable expenditure and probably would be apportioned among the various locomotive and rail equipment companies in this country . Prior to the break-down of the German-Brazilian trade agreement , the Reich had become a formidable competitor for the rich Brazilian market , taking raw products on a barter basis for manufactured goods . However , in the latter part of June the Bank of Brazil , havingpiled up a huge surplus of German blocked marks . ceased to take this currency , good only for purchases within the Reicn . Relations between the two countries were strained further by the recent abortive fascist revolt in Brazil , and by discovery that Germany . in its frantic search for foreign exchange , was reselling Brazilian saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulu , found herself undersold in her own natural markets . U. S. Brazilian Relations Meanwhile , trade relations between the ' United States and Brazil have been improving steadily aided , in particular , by a monetary agreement and a gold loan for currency stabilization purposes . The orders for rail equipment , now in process of negotiation , will be more than welcome to the industry in this country , which has Just concluded an unfavorable half year . Contracts were placed for only 75 locomotives in the initial six months of 1938. against 228 in the like 1937 period . Baldwin Locomotive Works operated at a small profit , aided by a comparatively large carryover of engine orders from last year . and by the substantial activity of its subsidiary , Midvale Co However , both American Locomotive Co . and Lima Locomotive Works are understood to have incurred losses . Baldwin 's aggregate shipments for the six months ended June 30 totaled more than $23 , - 000.000. or somewhat above what is considered the pay point . However , the company 's backlog as of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 and the company has received practically no new locomotive business in the past six months . The BaldwinSouthwark subsidiary , makers of castings and special equipment , has been doing relatively better than the locomotive division recently . Latest Report Shows Profit Baldwin 's larger locomotive carryover ? which on December 31 , 1937 had an aggregate value of more than $13,000,000 ? as compared to the other companies was due in part to delays in deliveries during 1937 , and Baldwin appears to have been making up for lost time . The lat ' est available earnings report , that for the 12 Imonths ended March 31 , showed a net profit of $185,096 American Locomotive had largely cleaned up its locomotive backlog in 1937. and started 1938 with aggregate bookings of around $10,500,000 . On April 16 , last , $10,300,000 orders were on the books .

So far this year American has received orders from domestic railroads for six steam and 14 Diesel engines . Lima in Red Figures Lima , engaged principally In locomotive manufacture , although it maintains a power shovel division , entered 1938 with only four locomotives on its books and total backlog of $821,000 . Orders for six steam locomotives have been reported so far this year . With its compact plant . Lima is usually able to hold down losses fairly well in slack periods like the present , but the company has been in red figures for 1938 to date . Of the total of 75 engines of all kinds ordered by American railroads so far this year , 20 were electric locomotives to be built in company shops , 25 Diesel-electric built by Electro-Motive Corp . General Motors subsidiary . while four have been placed in miscellaneous shops . Latest available figures show total locomotives on order June 1 at 62 , of which 58 are steam and six Diesel .

Suggestion of RFC Chairman A recent development encouraging to the locomotive builders ' outlook is the statement of I Jesse Jones , RFC head , that " good power " would help the carriers " earn their way out of the present financial difficulties . " The RFC head also has stated that railrod officials and government agencies have been discussing possibilities of liberalizing loans for equipment purchases . The failure of Congress to enact helpful legislation at its last session dampened hopes for government financial aid . but the problem continues under consideration in Washington . The need for new motive power as an economy measure is widely recognized , the barriers in the way of a comprehensive buying program by the railroads being mainly financial and psychological at present . With increased traffic and liberalized loan sources , locomotive makers feel their business eventually will improve . However , it is strongly emphasized that traffic recovery is the factor moat needed to stimulate rail buying as a number of carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. arc holding plans in abeyance until the general carrier picture clears . Such aids as the recently granted passenger fare rate increase are regarded as important , but not sufficient to offset the other factors now holding back equipment replacements .
