txt  | him thereafter . With the Moslems swarming around him , and the Christian fleets drawing nearer , he set out from his camp and marched on the great city of Acre . " Never , " cries a chronicler , " did another show such audacity , and it is truly wonderful that he had the enterprise to go to fight men who were a hundred to his four . " When released , Lusignan had given his word that he would not bear arms against the Moslems . Now he broke his faith . Of course the patriarch had insisted that he was king , and so must go out again to the war . And the priests declared that it would be a sin to keep a pledge that would harm the Church . Guy appeased his conscience by a petty makeshift . He did not wear his sword now ; it was hung upon his saddle peak instead of his girdle , so that he might say that he did not bear arms . But the truth remains , that he broke his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made no protest . He much preferred to have the harmless Guy in command of the Christians , and he had released the king with that end in view . Meanwhile the Moslem scouts reported to the sultan who was then at Belfort that the king 's small army was marching down the coast , leaving Tyre behind it . Saladin wished to march at once , and descend upon it from the hills . But all his amirs advised him to wait , until the presumptuous little army should reach Acre . Then the sultan could cut it off and destroy it between his host and the garrison of Acre . This was sound advice from a military point of view , and Saladin yielded to it . And in yielding he made his greatest mistake . He was thinking of the north , listening for the approach of Barbarossa and watching for the sails of the crusaders ' fleets ? the fleets that might land anywhere from Constantinople to Cairo . By all the laws of warfare , Guy 's seventyfour hundred were doomed ? since Saladin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them before they could possibly return to Tyre . So , for the time being , Guy 's army was no more than a pawn , moving out of its own accord to a vacant square without any protection . And it would be poor strategy for the Moslem players to attack this pawn with their stronger  | pieces , while the enemy was preparing to attack elsewhere . The game itself was at hazard , because the crowned heads of Christendom were grouped about the chessboard . The pawn moved . Down past the rocky shoulder of the Ladder of Tyre , where it might easily have been cut off , since here the hills jutted into the sea . And now it is necessary to glance at the square of the chessboard lying before it . The plain of Acre , they called it . A flat shore , stretching south for twenty-odd miles , from the Ladder of Tyre to the mass of Mount Carmel . A fertile shore , hot and green in this month of August , extending roughly seven miles inland to the foothills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes of the higher ranges , with Hermon 's bald summit above them . Midway along the shore a small , low promontory stuck out . All this promontory was surrounded by a wall , and within the wall lay the city of Acre . South of Acre , a long shallow half-moon bay extended to the point of Carmel . The shore here was sandy . Palm groves clustered above the sedge grass . A small river , laboring across the plain , debouched into a half-dozen streams that ended in the sedge , forming a marsh . Such was the plain of Acre , and upon it waited a destiny more terrible than the fate of Waterloo . The army of crusaders should never have descended into it from the rocks of the Ladder of Tyre . Having done so , they should have been destroyed by the Moslems . So say the rules of warfare . But the men and women who marched across the plain of Acre were driven by an impulse more potent than all the reasoning of warfare ? the perversity of human beings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the road to Jerusalem , and Acre was the first city upon their way . In spite of everything , they decided to besiege Acre . There were , however , wise heads among them , and instead of camping under the walls they marched direct to a mound , or rather a series of mounds above the orchards a half mile from t he sea . While the tents were pitched on the high ground , the men-at-arms labored at digging a ditch around the mounds . All through the night they worked , and in the morning they  | diverted the water from the nearest stream into the ditch so that they had a fairly good moat around the camp . Then they began to throw up an earth wall behind the ditch . Naturally the Moslems in Acre took an interest in their visitors , and sallied out to skirmish in the plain . Nothing serious happened for a while because the Moslems were waiting for Saladin to come down from his hills and erase this audacious encampment , while the Christian knights knew better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain for supplies , and they did not lack for water . They christened the new position the Toron , or the Hill . And , realizing that they were cut off here , and would soon be besieged , they began to turn anxious faces toward the hills . Only a day 's ride past Saffuriya to the east lay the great plateau of Hattin , where even the ravens had long since forsaken the gaunt bones of the dead . So they waited on the bare brown knolls , with the banner of the cross planted by the queen 's pavilion , and their horses picketed down in the grass by the ditch . What happened then is related by a minstrel of the court named Ambrose who was there and saw it all . They dared not linger in the groves below them ; they stayed on the heights . It was three days after our men arrived and settled themselves on the Toron , where they kept under arms all night against the attacks of the Saracens , that the troops of Salahadin came ? Turks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third day of the week Salahadin came himself , thinking that he would soon have the heads of the Christians . Do not be surprised if they , who defended their heads , were uneasy and anxious during the watches and labors on this Toron where they had settled themselves . The Turks assailed them night and clay , and wearied them so much they could scarcely eat . There Geoffrey of Lusignan spared himself nothing in defending the host . Long had he been hardy and wise , but now he gained great renown . From Monday to Friday they were all in this peril . But you will see how God defended them . While the king and all his men were in such fear that they  | watched the far-off sea and begged God to send them some aid , behold ? there arrived a great fleet of barks with people in them . It was James of Avesnes , from Flanders . I do not believe that Alexander or Hector was ever a better knight than he . It was James , who had sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of Him who died and arose again . He had with him fourteen thousand renowned men-at-arms . Then it was the fleet of Danemark that came with many fine castellans , who had good brown horses , strong and swift . What had happened was that the Pisan , the Danish , and Frisian fleets bearing the crusaders to the coast had sailed down from Tripoli to Tyre . There they heard of the king 's sally to Acre , and came on to join him . Galleys and ships were run up on the beach near the city , and the newcomers fought their way across the plain to the camp . Conrad of Montserrat arrived from Tyre in his ships , to join the gathering host . The Christians now numbered more than thirty thousand and their ships blockaded the port of Acre . They dared extend their lines on either hand , so that the Toron camp became a semi-circle , isolating Acre from the hills .  | SALADIN , seeing that the real force of the crusaders was centering here , called in his divisions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on the siege of Belfort . His first effort in that month of September was to provision and strengthen Acre , which had not been prepared for a siege . Without much trouble , Taki ad Din 's cavalry broke through the camp of the Pisans which adjoined the sea at the northern end of the semi-circle , and for two days kept open this avenue of approach , while strings of camels laden with grain and supplies were passed in , with a whole corps of the army commanded by Karakush who had been summoned from Cairo . The sultan and Baha ad Din went in and walked along the walls , studying the lines of the crusaders . With the city thus strengthened , Saladin withdrew from it , and took command of his army which had been increased daily by new contingents . Moving down from the hills into the plain , he surrounded the crusaders in his turn , and struck at them with his horsemen . Ambrose tells how , in this crisis , new masses of crusaders arrived from the sea .  | A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brienne arrived to join us , and with him his brother Andrew , son of a good father and a goo dmother . There came also the seneschal of Flanders with more than twenty barons , and a German landgrave bringing with him good Spanish horses . And the bishop of Beauvais who was neither aged nor infirm , with Count Robert his brother , a skillful and nimble knight . And the count of Bar , as courteous a man as you could find . Many others , valiant and wise , joined the host at the same time . But the more they came , the less the Saracens feared them . Night and day they delivered attacks , and approached even to the tents . Those in the city made sorties . Know well that they had not been taken from plough and cart , those people in Acre . They were the best of the infidels , to guard and defend a city . The others outside grew in number every day , and filled the whole country so that our people looked upon themselves as prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the line the Christians were extending around the city . As usual , he chose for the attack a Friday when the Moslems all over the world would be at prayer . He was in the saddle himself before daybreak , and without eating anything . " Like a mother , " says Baha ad Din , " who has lost her child . " He launched his cavalry at different points of the line , to break the close ranks of the stolid men-at-arms , and to separate the divisions of the crusaders . But the issue was not decided that day , nor for several days thereafter . On a Friday of the month of September Ambrose relates I remember that a dire and sad misfortune befell our people . The Saracens attacked them without a day 's respite . The Christians armed themselves and arranged themselves in good order , in the different commands that had been agreed upon . On one flank the Hospital and the Temple held the river where numerous enemies were ? it was they who always began a battle . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men , the landgrave and the Germans who formed a great company , remained by a deserted mosque and cemetery . King Guy and the Pisans and other valiant men were on the right , at the Toron , to watch the Turks . The Saracens came on with spirit . You would have seen fine regiments among them .  | The Templars and the Hospitalers charged , assailed the first ranks , pierced them , threw them into disorder , drove them in flight and pursued them . Then the other Christians charged also , and the Saracens gave ground . But there was such a mass of them that the Christians did not know where to turn . The Turks could not rally themselves . They were drawing near the hills , when the Devil mixed himself in it and caused the death of many of our men . A horse belonging to a German ran away ; its owner pursued it , and his companions also ran after the horse without being able to catch it . The horse ran toward the city . The Saracens believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged in their turn . And they carried themselves so well that those who should have directed our army were only able to defend themselves . While the worthy Ambrose attributed the defeat to Satan 's power , the Moslems knew better , and Baha ad Din wrote a clearer account of the battle . It seems that the best of the Moslem generals , Taki ad Din , commanded the strong right ' cling of Saladin 's army . The sultan himself led the center , which was made up of their household troops . One of the older amirs , Meshtub , had the left wing , with mixed divisions of Kurds , Arabs , and mamluks , near the river . When the Templars charged , Taki ad Din decided to draw back his line to higher ground , and Saladin mistook this maneuver for flight . The sultan sent his reserve cavalry from the center to the retreating right wing . The commanders of the Christian center noticed this weakening of the Moslem center and charged point-blank at the sultan 's standard . Some Moslem regiments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little without breaking ranks . So by midday the Moslem right wing was swinging away from the rest of the army , and the center was pivoting back on the unbroken left . It was as if the crusaders had pushed apart double folding doors . They poured through the gap , pursuing the scattered Moslem regiments ? some of which fled headlong until they reached the bridge over the Jordan ! ? until they sighted Saladin 's camp ahead of them . The guards of the camp rode off , and the light-fingered Arab clansmen began to plunder figure  | the tents even when the crusaders were riding in . Some of the knights penetrated as far as Saladin 's pavilion before they realized that they had advanced miles beyond their main forces , and that the Moslems on either hand were making ready to resume the battle . Then the too-venturesome crusaders started back on tired horses , only to be struck and badly mauled by Taki ad Din 's and Saladin 's horsemen on either hand . They were thrown into disorder and lost heavily . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul be saved ? and never died a knight so valiant and helpful . The marquis of Montserrat was so hemmed in by his enemies that he would have been left there if the king Guy had not aided him . And here also was slain the master of the Temple ? he who spoke that good word , learned in a good school , when all , brave and fearful alike , called to him after the attack , " Come away , sir , come away ! " He could have come , if he had wished it . " Please God , " he answered them , " no one will see me again elsewhere , and no one may reproach the Temple because I had been seen flying . " And he did not do it ; he died there , for too many Turks cast themselves upon him . And of the common men , five thousand died there ? stripped and bare their bodies lay on the field . When those others in the city heard of the defeat of our men , they mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our men with such fury that they would have done them great harm if it had not been for their fine defense . But our men faced them . The knights struck good blows ; the king Guy did wonders , and Geoffrey of Lusignan , who endured much that day , did likewise , with that valiant James of Avesnes . So the enemy were beaten back and driven within the city again . So passed this day in which fortune went against us . The Saracens were so encouraged ? may God curse them as I curse them ? that they began to vex and harass the Christians more than they had done before . When the valiant men and the barons saw this , they said , " Seigneurs , we gain no advantage at all . We must resolve upon something to protect ourselves against these offspring of Satan who torment us every day and steal our horses in the night . " Here is the resolution they made . They dug a ditch , wide and deep , and lined it with shields , mantlets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground by the ditch . However , the Saracens attacked them without ceasing , and left them no peace .  | Listen to a sad thing ! At the end of the slaughter of which I have spoken , and which was so grievous for the Franks ? the day after the elite of the host had been discomforted and so many poor people who had come there for God had found death ? Salahadin had all the dead bodies taken up and sent back tous by casting them into the river of Acre . This was an ugly shambles , for the bodies drifted down the current until they arrived in the midst of the army , and as the heaps of the dead grew , such an odor arose that all the army had to go off far enough to be beyond it . And long after they had been buried , we still kept away from the odor . Meanwhile the Christians worked at the ditch which served them as a rampart . They kept themselves behind it when the Saracens came to attack it , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the battle field of the people of God , and of these dogs . Our men wished to dig it deeper and the others wished to destroy it . You would have seen then . . . arrows . They who dug the ditch passed them up to those who defended it . You would have seen , on both sides , men hardy and courageous . You would have seen the fighters fall , rolling over , and cutting open bellies , and giving heavy blows . Only the night separated them . Even those of us who were most at ease endured fears and watches and fatigues ; they dared not take rest before finishing the ditch . On the eve of All Saints ' Day happened a great misadventure . Those who were on the Toron watched the side toward Haifa , and they saw a great fleet of galleys approach from Egypt . The fleet drew near in good array , and the news spread swiftly throughout the host . Some believed , although no one knew it for certain , that these were vessels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came to aid in the siege . While they gave themselves up to wondering , the galleys carne in , and they came in so well that they entered the port of Acre and in doing so they carried off one of our ships which had men and provisions on it . This ship was towed into the city , the men were killed and the provisions taken . Listen to what the Turks did . On All Saints ' Day , they hung on the walls of Acre in defiance the bodies of the Christians they had killed in the ship . So the souls of these dead shared , our preachers said , in the great joy of the heavens that day . This fleet of which I have told you guarded so well the port and the coast that aid no longer arrived for the defenders of God . The  | winter came on , without bringing fresh provisions to them . They had finished the ditch , but later on it was ruined in spite of them . So Ambrose wrote , in blunt , awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the line of the Christian camp , and failed . While the crusaders had been worsted and cut to pieces on the first day of the battle , they held their ground thereafter . Saladin felt that the issue must be decided now , and the attacks pushed home . Ill as he was with malaria , he summoned his amirs to his tent , saying , " Now we have before us the chance of victory . Our enemies are few , but they will remain and more will come over the sea . And the only aid we can look for is from Al Adil , in Egypt . It seems best to me to attack . " But for the second time the amirs persuaded him to change his mind . The autumn rains were beginning , with the holy month of Ramadan , and they were eager to return to their homes for the winter 's planting . The sultan himself was ill , and later , in the spring , Malik Adil would join them . So they argued and Saladin , as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cease the battle , withdrawing himself to his main camp in the hills . Arabs and detachments of regulars were left in the foothills to watch the crusaders . During the stormy season no new fleets could approach the coast of the Holy Land , nor were the ships of the crusaders ? long , unseaworthy galleys , or round tubs of cargo vessels or open barks ? able to blockade the port of Acre . Winds from the west drove a heavy , ceaseless swell upon the shelterless shore , and the larger boats that could not be drawn up on the beaches had to return to the northern harbors or to Cyprus . In mist and wind and beating rain the year 1189 ended . The siege of Acre had begun . But the crusaders outside the walls were hemmed in and besieged in their turn . Open warfare in the outer country ceased for the time being , and in the Acre plain a new kind of strife was born ? trench warfare .  | SEEN from a distance , Acre looked very much like a clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless fist that never changed . Its outer wall made a right angle , stretching from the joint of the little finger inland to the wrist bone . At this angle rose a square bastion and a mighty tower that the crusaders christened the Accursed Tower . South from the Accursed Tower , along the other side of the angle , the wall extended as far as the joint of the thumb , where it reached the water . Then , like a massive thumb crooked away from the clenched fist , the wall went out some two hundred yards into the water , forming a harbor between it and the city proper . It ended in a tower . Between this tower and the city ? between the curved thumb and the first finger of the fist ? an isolated tower rose from the water . This , for good reason , was known as the Tower of Flies . From it , a great chain ran to the end of the wall , just under the surface of the water . The chain prevented enemy ships from coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a Moslem vessel pass .   Within the large right angle of the outer wall stood a smaller angle , the inner wall ? on higher ground . The broad space between the two was occupied by the troops , the horse lines , and markets . Rising over the inner wall could be seen the watch towers of the Templars ' house , and the terraces of the Hospital , and the poplars around the little cathedral . ( For Acre had been built almost entirely by the crusaders , and the Moslems had only held it for two years . ) The bell tower of the cathedral was now surmounted by a muezzin 's balcony , and the call to prayer echoed among the kneeling throngs in the courtyard below . Many of the crusaders knew every stone of the great city wall ? upon the summit of which four horsemen could pass , riding in different directions ? with its square towers and fortified gates . They knew that no scaling ladders planted in the wide ditch would prevail against that wall . Nor would the Moslems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . To enter Acre the crusaders must build engines powerful enough to open a breach in the wall . And nothing could be done during the deluge of rains . In the mud of the plain a strange city was growing up within the camp of the besiegers . A city of tents and clay walls , lying in a half circle beyond arrow shot of the battlements of Acre . Its walls were yellow clay and sand , its streets were mud , and its gutters canals . Under bending date palms clustered the drenched pavilions of noblewomen , ladies of Beyond the Sea and the courts of the West . When the sun struck through the clouds , they rode out on their palfreys , long skirts hiding their feet , and satnite and velvet sleeves hanging from their shoulders . The newest arrivals wore brave , embroidered crosses upon their breasts . Around them thronged youthful esquires in heavy mantles , and proud knights in girdled chapes and surcoats lined with ermine or sable . Hunting dogs trotted after them . They might ride along the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrenched city  --  where naked fishermen swam out against the surf , towing nets behind them . Or they  | might venture into the perilous plain , where Arab horsemen watched for a chance to snatch loot or slay a Christian and carry off his head . Mounted bowmen went out to hunt the Arabs , and knights relieved the dull hours by coursing hares and riding after gazelles toward the foothills . Through the streets of the tent city surged a motley throng ? burghers debating the price of corn and barley stored in warehouses , valerets and masterless men seeking the sheds where sheep were slaughtered and broiled over glowing charcoal , gaunt men-at-arms in leather jackets . Soft Provencal voices mingled with harsh German tongues ; blacksmiths ' hammers clattered with the swordsmiths ' forges ; carpenters ' axes tapped at the great ships ' timbers that were being shaped into arms for the mangonels and sheds for the rams . Even the rain could not wash away their good humor . Soon these mangonels would be casting darts at the infidels of Acre , and the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder . Pilgrims labored to aid the carpenters in the good work , and they sang together : " Hear us , O Christ our King , Hear us , O Thou Who art Lord of Kings , And show us the way . " And the voices of barefoot monks made answer : " Have pity upon us , And show us the way . " At nightfall processions wound through the streets , carrying tapers , and throngs gathered in the chapels , between walls of damp clay bricks , where the good bishops with their golden crooks sat in their robes by the new altars , and the swinging censers sweetened the stench of the mud underfoot . At all hours men came to the churches for their needs ? the sick to be sprinkled with holy water , babies to be christened , troubled spirits to be confessed and relieved . For the church was the life center of this multitude ?  | council chamber , and dispensary , and hospital . It was pleasant for tired eyes to watch the soft lights moving over the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was good to hear the rise and fall of the old chants that even the fishermen knew , the Ave Maria , and the Te Deum. here the shaggy jackmen were as much at home as the valiant father bishop of Beauvais , who liked nothing better than to don armor , and who dreamed of becoming a second Turpin ? " If , " as one man put it , " he could find a Charlemagne . " " Verily , " said another , " here is the Frisian who hath left his fish scales , and the Scotsman who hath left his fellowship with lice . " True , they had no acknowledged leader , but they managed well enough . And by early summer the valiant old emperor , Red Beard himself , would come down out of the north with the German host . While , men said , at home the young king , Richard of England , had made up his long quarrel with Philip king of the French , and the twain had taken the cross from the hand of William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , with their armies . Meanwhile the artisans of the tent city were finishing three mighty towers built upon rollers and strengthened by heavy timbers and covered with fresh hides nailed to the wood ? to protect them against fire . These three towers tapered to summits higher than the wall of Acre , and when they could be rolled against the wall ? then the good work would begin . The rains diminished , the muddy water dried in the ditches , and fresh winds cleared the sky , so that the sun beat down again on the damp walls of Acre and on the dark tent city of the plain . Soft green covered the sand and clay , and spread to the distant summits of the hills . The sound of running water ceased , and the ground all at once became hard underfoot . Along the beaches , the heavy pulse of the swell dwindled . Sails moved over the motionless sea . Horses and sheep were taken out to the plain to graze , under guard , and men wandered about restlessly . Spring had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war began again . Rusted mail was washed and cleaned with oil ? bows  | spliced anew , and arrows sorted over . Men swarmed like flies around the clumsy wooden engines , twisting ropes into place ? drawing the engines out over bridges across the ditch , into the no-man 's land between the camp and the walls . Sturdy arms carried mantlets ? giant wicker shields covered with leather ? and set them up in a line within arrow shot of the walls . Knights in armor led out their chargers and stood by , to guard the new line of assault . Meanwhile the galleys from Tyre came down , with the Genoese fleet , and the crusaders thronged to the shore to watch the daily skirmishing between their ships and the Moslem galleys from the port . Men waited eagerly for their turn to go out on the ships . The daring seamen even forced their way into the harbor past the Tower of Flies and towed out a Moslem vessel , landing their prisoners on the shore . The joy was great Ambrose explains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their hands , to seize the Turks by the hair and tug at them with all their strength . Then they cut off their heads and carried them away . At sea , by God 's grace , we had the victory ? for detachments of knights from the host , valiant men and well armed who fought hardily , took turns upon the boats . Our fleet drove the enemy galleys within the chain . From that day the Turks shut up within the city could not receive any aid by sea or land . Slowly the three great towers creaked and swayed , drawing nearer to the outer wall , while mangonels upon their summits spewed iron darts upon the battlements . Large as mountains were the three towers , each with half a thousand men within it . On one the banner of the landgrave stood , on another that of the king Guy , and on the third that of the marquis Conrad ? who had come back from Tyre for the assault . From the embrasures of these moving pyramids crossbrows snapped and their iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarrels struck a man they tore through shield and mail and flesh and bone . From the barricade on the tops of the towers skilled archers plied their shafts . Sliding over stone rollers , the towers drew nearer the moat of Acre .  | Already columns of men waited , behind the shelter of the mantlets , to run forward into the towers , when the drawbridges should be lowered upon the wall and swordsmen would rush forward . Swiftly the Moslems labored , to destroy the towers before they could approach too near . Engines on the walls , working under the direction of Karakush , the mamluk who knew all the arts of siege and defense , cast stones against them . But they were built of solid beams joined together . The beams cracked and yielded , without breaking . Other engines shot out flaming timbers that struck down the crusaders on the tops . But hides soaked in vinegar covered the wood , and prevented the fire from catching . While the throngs of men labored , a youth of Baghdad , Ibn an-Nadjar by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . " I wish , " said an-Nadjar , " to aid my master Saladin , and burn these towers . " The veteran mamluk listened with half an ear . " And how wilt thou do that ? " " I will prepare naphtha by a formula I know , and I will cast it upon the towers . If they were steel , they would burn . " " Ah , well , " Karakush looked at him . " Do the best thou canst . " And he gave the young copper worker two hundred dinars to prepare his materials . Later in the day , an-Nadjar was ready . He returned to the wall with soldiers who lugged three large copper cylinders from which short tubes projected . These pots , as the Moslems called them , were placed opposite the wooden pyramids , and one of them was lifted into the arm of a stone caster . The arm was drawn back , and released ? whirling the copper bomb against the broken face of the tower opposite . Flames roared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams . Within the tower the crusaders could not go near the copper bomb , and the fire caught , soaring up when the wind sucked at it . By sunset on that day the three mighty towers lay in smoking embers . The loss of the towers put an end to the attack , and the  | crusaders withdrew into their camp to plan new engines . They had known of the terrible weapon of the Arabs that they called Greek and wild fire , and they had heard that it was compounded of sulphur or naphtha , but this was the first time they had felt the effects of it . They were too full of hope to be discouraged . Did not the men from the ships say that the great kings of England and France had put to sea with new hosts ? And rumors trickled down through the mountains of the Armenians ? strange stories of Barbarossa at odds with the treacherous Byzantines ? prevailing over the Byzantines , and marching on and on , over the barren lands , drawing nearer every day . Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of ships . Soon they would be ready again to face the minions of Mahound , the very legions of Anti-Christ who had mocked them from the wall . Jackmen and axmen , valerets and peasants , seafarers and bowmen ? they put their heads together , and decided to do something on their own account . While the great lords lingered , they chafed at the waiting . They could not climb the wall of Acre , that was certain . But off yonder they could see the tents of the infidels , in the foothills , and they wanted to strike a blow or two . Besides , there would be plunder in the tents . So they banded together , burly Flemings and shaggy Danes , eager Provenrcals , and Pisans . Sergeants , ribalds , and men-at-arms ? ten thousand of them marched off toward the foothills without leaders , on the fete of St. James . " They were , " Ambrose says , " poor fellows , having great need and driven by their suffering , for we were not at ease in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later in the day word came back that they had entered the tents . But they did not appear with their spoil and presently some knights went to look for them . That evening a few of the infantry did come back , escorted by the horsemen , and without plunder of any kind . The rest of them , seven thousand , lay dead within the Moslem lines .  | But the daily conflicts in no-man 's land , around the engines , went on without ceasing . Ambrose made note of them . As the days passed , many things happened . Before and behind the stone casters , which were numerous in the host , many men came and went . I can not remember or relate all the adventures , but here is one . A Turk came out with his bow for a shot at our men , and would not go away . A Frenchman , aroused by this obstinacy , went out on his side . The Frenchman called himself Marcaduc ? he was no son of a duke or a king ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grayir . The one made ready to aim on the other ? the Frenchman on the Turk , the Turk on the Frenchman . Grayir demanded what country Marcaduc was from . " I am of France , " he replied , " and thou art mad to come down here . " " Thou art no bad shot , " the Turk said to him . " Wilt thou make an agreement ? I will shoot , and thou wilt stand the blow without flinching , and if I miss , I will await thy shaft in the same way . " He talked so much , and begged so that the Frenchman agreed . Then he shot , but his hand slipped and the arrow did not fly . Marcaduc said to him , " My turn to shoot ? wait for me ! " " No , " he said , " let me shoot again , and thou canst then try twice at me . " " Willingly , " said the Frenchman . But while the Turk was feeling in his quiver for a good shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not relish the new arrangement , let go his own arrow and shot him in the heart . " By Saint Denis , I will wait no more for thee . " Another time , it happened that a knight was down in the fosse , outside , on an affair of his own that no one can do without . As he placed himself so , a Turk in one of the outposts ? to which he was paying no attention ? separated from his companions and raced his horse forward . It was villainous and discourteous to seek to surprise the knight while he was so occupied . The Turk was already far from his own people , and was approaching the knight with lance in rest to slay him , when our men shouted , " Run , sir ? run , run ! " I lc had barely time to get up . The Turk came up at a full gallop , believing that he would be able to turn his horse and wheel back , if he needed to do so , but by God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to one side , and took up two stones in his hands  | ? listen to how God takes vengeance ! As the Turk checked his horse to turn back upon him , the knight saw him clearly , and as he drew near , struck him with one of the stones upon the temple . The Turk fell dead , and the knight took his horse and led it off by the rein . He who told me this saw the knight mount the horse and ride him off to his tent , where he kept him with much joy ... . Many of our people who were attacking the walls of Acre tried to fill up the ditches . ' Some gave it up , but others went on piling in the stones they carried there . Barons brought them as well , on their chargers or pack horses , and many women also found satisfaction in carrying them . Among the others , there was one woman who took great pleasure in it . A Saracen archer , on guard upon the wall , saw this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she came forward , he aimed at her , and struck her . The woman fell to earth mortally wounded , and every one gathered round her . She was twisting her limbs in agony , when her husband came to seek her . But she demanded of all who were there ? valiant men and ladies- that , on behalf of God and their own souls , they should make use of her body to fill in the ditch whither she had carried so many stones . This was done , when God had taken her soul . Now there is a woman who should be remembered ! Days went by , and the grass turned brown under the scorching of the sun . The axes of the carpenters tap-tapped along the beams ; the forges of the smithies muttered and purred . Riderless horses were seen galloping over the plain . A dry wind stirred the brittle palms , and brought to the camp the distant sound of weapons clashing and the hoarse voices of laboring men . Dust swirled around the tents , where women lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the host sat in talk , anxious for news ? uncertain what to do next . The water was growing bad , and they had seen the banners of Saladin again on the hills . One day there was a new sound . Drums thrumming in the foothills and cymbals clashing . Horsemen in mail rode  | down , to wheel before the watching crusaders , and swing their long sleeves over their heads . A few hours later ? the city always seemed to know the tidings from the hills , although no man could pass through the crusaders ' lines , or any ship through the blockade ? the excitement spread to the wall . Turbaned heads appeared between the crenels , and voices mocked the besiegers . " Slain is your emperor ! He hath come to his end and now ... it is as if he had never been . " Troubled were the barons of the host . The good Barbarossa dead ! But what of his army , and the German princes ? Other crusaders came in ships to the shore ? Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the kings . And Thibault of Blois , with the proud count of Clermont , and the tall count of Chalons . The chivalry of France was assembling anew in the camp , but they brought evil tidings . Barbarossa was indeed dead . The old emperor had been at the head of his army , within sight of the Armenian mountains , after many a desert march and struggle . At a ford , where the freshet ran deep , his horse had stumbled , throwing him , clad in his mail , into the water . He had been lifted out , but the shock had weakened the old man and within a few days he ceased to live . His son Frederick had taken command , but many of his nobles had turned back . Others were at Antioch . The crusaders listened grimly , and after a council chose Henry of Champagne to command them , and to assault Acre without delay .  | FROM his base in the foothills , seven miles away , Saladin watched and weighed events . He saw the steady increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hourly from Acre . In the north the little garrison of Belfort had yielded at last , and the mountain strongholds were all in his hands . But the new leader of the crusaders , Count Henry , sallied out to attack the camp of the Moslems , and Saladin was the first in the saddle . He had with him then the armies of 1 ) amascus , of Egypt and Mosul , and his veteran horsemen beat back the Christian onset , taking a heavy toll with their swords . It was like thrusting back the incoming tide . The water could be dammed or turned aside , but the pressure of the water never ceased ? more and more of it came in from the sea . And the Moslems waited anxiously for word from the far North , whither Taki ad Din had gone with the army of Aleppo to check the advance of Barbarossa . Saladin knew now that the great emperor was dead . A letter came in from the Catholicos , the Christian bishop of Ani ? who sent information to Saladin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had forty-two thousand men , somber and weary men wearing nothing but armor , marching with rigid discipline and intent only on reaching the Sepulcher . The Armenians had withdrawn from them , and Kilidj Arslan 's Seljuks were attacking them . Then the Catholicos sent down a spy , who told this story : I took my stand on a bridge that they had to pass , to watch them , and I saw many men pass by , almost all without mail shirts and without lances . When I asked them the cause of this , they replied , " Our provisions were gone and all our firewood , so we were forced to burn a great part of our gear and furniture . We had many dead . We were obliged to kill our horses and eat their meat , and to feed the fire with our lances . " They were still very numerous , but growing more feeble , having almost no horses or supplies . The greater part of their baggage they carried on donkey back . The third message came in from Taki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Germans , and scattered them along the plain of Antioch . Only five thousand survivors escorting their sick prince reached the shelter of the city ? where the Armenians and the lord of Antioch were scheming to seize their treasure chests . Saladin no longer needed to guard against the German crusaders . He ordered the northern armies back to Acre and the victorious Taki ad Din rode in with his son and the lords of Baalbek and Shaizar , while his wild Kurds sang of their deeds , and the drums of the Moslem camp thundered a greeting to them . The sultan received his nephew in his own tent , and feasted him with a full heart . In these months Saladin had to force his fever-racked body to keep to the saddle , and he leaned more and more upon the strength of Taki ad Din who had once been a hare-brained raider but who was now the most able general on either side . Before long the Germans also reached Acre . But they drifted down in ships , some two thousand of them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swabia commanded this remnant of the great host that had set out with Barba rossa.  | Saladin heard of them , and their condition , almost as quickly as the crusaders who welcomed them . Twice a day , the mamluks in Acre reported to their master in the hills , by pigeon post . Messenger pigeons , released from the roofs of the city , flew over the crusaders ' lines to the pavilions of the sultan . On the minute scrolls of paper within the silver cylinders attached to their claws were written the details of the siege ? the losses in fighting , the progress of the enemy 's engines , and the amount of provisions on hand . Just now ? at the end of the summer ? the crusaders were closing in on the wall with grim determination . The battle of the engines began again . The mightiest of the perriers on either side were matched against each other , fighting gigantic duels with boulders and tree trunks as missiles , until one or the other was broken down . The pigeon reports told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tip heated red hot , shot from the wall . The struggle went on at sea as well . The Pisans built a roof over one of the galleys , and constructed platforms upon the masts , with flying bridges that could be lowered from these fighting tops . While other galleys bombarded the " Tower of Flies with missiles , this strange craft was laid alongside the tower , and the seamen attempted to board the tower from the bridges . The attack was beaten off , and the galley burned by Greek fire . What bothered the defenders most were two beliers ? the Moslems knew what the Christians called them ? built by the bishop of Besancon and the duke of Swabia : two moving castles with framework of iron , and a kind of protective mat of plaited ropes on the side facing the wall . Their tops were fortified , and in the opening beneath one of them an iron beast 's head hung waiting to be swung against the lower stones of the wall . The beliers went forward on wheels , while attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been filled in . Karakush and his men tried everything , to find a vulnerable spot in the moving castles . When whole marble columns shot from the largest stone casters failed to break the iron framework , the Moslems cast out dry wood  | Din , writing his journal in the sultan 's tents , knew as well as Ambrose in the crusaders ' huts what happened each day ? knew how food was failing and how the last ships of the autumn brought in the first English contingents led by a certain archbishop of Canterbury , a warlike prelate . Gangs of Arabs made nightly raids upon the crusaders ' horse lines and seldom returned without trophies of some kind . They even crept through the guards . Clad in black , and moving as silently as animals , they stole into the huts where men lay sleeping ? and awakened the sleepers with knives at their throats . Holding fast their prisoners , they explained by signs that an outcry would result in a slit throat . Then they stole back with their captives through the lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archbishop and Count Henry and Conrad the marquis ? made a sortie in force to get possession of a supply of provisions the Moslems had left by the palm grove of Haifa , in the shadow of Carmel . They crossed the river and marched in a compact column between the swarms of Moslem horsemen , the Templars and the English keeping the rear . They were out in the open country for three days , and Saladin , lying helpless in the grip of fever , fretted himself with worrying because he could not take the saddle against them . And after three days of fighting they cut their way back again to the Christian camp without the provisions , that the Moslems had had time to remove . So the balance held even between the two hosts . If food was scanty in the crusaders ' camp , it was still more so in the city of Acre ; if an epidemic swept through Saladin 's open camp , it raged more disastrously among the Christians . The two sides were so accustomed to the sight of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankish soldiers sometimes ceased fighting to talk . The two throngs mingled , singing and dancing together , after which they returned to fighting . One they said , " We have been fighting for a long time ? let us stop a while and allow the boys of the camps to show what they can do . " So they matched two parties of boys , who struggled together with great eagerness . One of the young Moslems , seizing a  | young infidel , lifted him off the ground and threw him down , making him a prisoner . A Frank who was watching came forward and redeemed the captive for two gold pieces . " He was your prisoner , " the Frank said , to the victorious youth . The rains began again , but brought no respite this time . The chronicles yield glimpses of the good and ill fortune of both sides ? the death of the duke of Swabia ? grain ships coming from Egypt at sunset in a rising storm ? the ships driven upon the shore by Acre , while Moslems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Part of the weakened city wall falling , and the garrison building it up anew under the swords of the advancing knights . . . a surprise attack upon the wall by a single ladder , that almost prevailed . . . Saladin , debating for long hours with his amirs , and in the end deciding to relieve the garrison . . . The warworn garrison taken off by the ships that brought fresh men in under command of Meshtub , the Kurd , during the storms ... Karakush still in command ... Even Ambrose , watching this struggle of unyielding multitudes , felt that something rather epic was taking place before his eyes . He knew , it seems , the legends of antiquity and the songs of the elder minstrels . He tried in his own crude verses to make clear what he felt : Seigneurs ! Not of the death of dlexander Whose passing made such direful clamor , Not of Paris , nor of Helen , Who had from their amour such pain , Nor of A'rthur 's deeds , of Brittany , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom jongleurs sing so merrily Do I know the verity . I can not say , ' t is truth or lie . But of what befell this host of //ere The cold , the ills , the pain they suffer Ill that I can relate indeed , find good it is for you to heed .  | In winter that brings the wind and the rain , it is then that the little folk of the host of Acre had so much misery . Famine had come , and day by day it grew greater . All went well enough , it is true , until Christmas , but when the time of Christmas passed , the lack of things was felt . A man could carry a cask of grain easily enough within his elbow yet it weighed upon him greatly because it cost a hundred besants . A single egg sold for six deniers . Seigneurs , I say in all truth that they skinned good war horses , and ate their meat voraciously . A crowd gathered around whenever a horse was killed , and a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Even the entrails were eaten . When the men who had money wished to share provisions with others they could not , because so many people came to demand food . Without the herbs they had planted from seed and out of which they now made soup , they could not have held out . You would have seen good sergeants , and even nobles accustomed to wealth , watching the herbage growing , and going out to crop it and eat it . A sickness followed , and I will tell you about that . It was caused by the rains that fell without ceasing , until all the host was drenched with water . Every one began to cough , and their voices became hoarse , while their heads and limbs swelled . ' A thousand died in a single day in the army . Because of the swelling , their teeth fell out of their mouths . Many could not cure themselves because they had no food . Listen to a great evil and a pity ! Some men , made by God in His image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of food was so great in the host that many of our people went over to the Turks . They renounced their faith , saying that God could never have been born of a woman ? the cross , and baptism , they renounced all that . There were in the host two comrades , poor sergeants , who had between them no more than one denier of Anjou , and nothing else unless it was their armor and clothing . They debated how they would use the denier ? what food they would buy with it , to suffice for a day . They cast lots , by counting the hairs on bits of fur , and finally they decided that they would buy beans . They got thirteen , and in this number they found one that was hollow . To change it , one of them had to go back more than seven acres , and then the merchant would only change it after much discussion . The sergeant  | returned , and they ate the beans , nearly mad with hunger . When the beans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men got along with a kind of locust bean and little nuts . Those who were sick drank heavily of strong wine ? of which they had a good supply ? but not having food to go with the wine , they died by threes and fours at a time . All the winter the famine lasted , and the men suffered , who had come to aid God ? from Christmas to mid-Lent . I know this for certain , and not by hearsay . There were provisions enough in the host , but the merchants sold them dear . Some men made a search for those who were most miserable ? the count Henry did much good , and Sir Josselin of Montoire , who ought not to be forgotten , the bishop of Salisbury , who did not keep his hands closed , and likewise many others who feared God . Supplies arrived at Tyre , but the marquis of Montserrat kept them there and did not let them come to the host . Then they cursed the marquis . No one knew what would happen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of the famine and the general discouragement , the siege was pressed . Before the end of Lent the first grain ships appeared off the coast , to the delight of the common folk who rejoiced in the fate of the Italian merchants who had hoarded grain in the camp for still higher prices . Between Saturday noon , when the ships arrived , and Monday , the price of grain fell from a hundred besants to four . In April of this year 1191 ? the second year of the siege ? the army had new cause to rejoice . Six great ships came in , one of them bearing the standard of France and the king , Philip II , Augustus . With him landed a splendid group of nobles ? the count of Flanders among them . The young king had been long on the way , but he was here , and the whole chivalry of western Europe gathered at last on the sands of Acre . Some of them saw a bad omen in the landing . A large white falcon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soared up over the camp . The falcon came down on the wall of Acre , to the satisfaction of the watching Moslems who caught it at once . Later , Philip sent an envoy to Saladin to  | buy back the bird , but the sultan answered that it could not be bought . After this the French pushed the attack with new spirit , pounding the crumbling wall with their engines . And at each attempt , Saladin 's horsemen , warned by the beating of drums in Acre , swarmed to attack the outer line of the crusaders ' camp . Then early in June twenty-five galleys and ships sailed in to the shore . At sight of them all work in the camp ceased , and barons and men-at-arms thronged down to the sea . The clamor of horns and uproar of voices greeted the leading galley ? a red vessel bearing the banner of England . That evening the tapers in the churches were lighted , and bonfires blazed on the shore , while the crusaders sat over their cups , or danced in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Richard , king of England , had landed . A man Baha ad Din explains mighty in strength , vast in courage , and firm in will . Great battles had he fought , and da.ing was he in war .  | THE Lion Heart had reached the camp , but not the battle line . On a pallet covered with leopard skins , under the sun-scorched linen pavilion , he tossed and twisted in the grip of fever , his lips and throat covered with sores . His long , powerful arms quivered with weakness . Yet Richard of England was in the prime of life , being thirty-four years of age and the very figure of a king . Red hair , with a tinge of gold , fell to his massive shoulders . His forehead was smooth and broad , the dark eyes beneath set wide apart . A short beard , close trimmed in the French fashion , covered his chin . A man he was , confident in his own strength , and intolerant of weakness . He had a boy 's generosity and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bravery of a tournament and the richness of a banquet board . He was never so pleased as when he wielded lance and sword , or tuned his own harp at a table . In every game he must have a hand , and in war he must be the leader . On the voyage hither he had lingered the best part of a year to champion the quarrel of his sister with Tancred ,  | usurper of Sicily ; he had exacted a treasure from Tancred , and had made lavish gifts in return . His ships , scattered by a storm , had been ill treated by the Byzantines of Cyprus , and Richard had waded ashore to range the island , until he held the Byzantine prince a captive in silver chains , and his daughter a hostage . In the very cathedral of Cyprus he had married Berengaria of Navarre , his betrothed . Straightway he had embarked again with his bride , attended by his sister and the girl princess of Byzantium , and with new treasure in his coffers . His counselors knew not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whether to bemourn the weeks and the lives wasted in the gaining of it . Richard himself cared not a jot for statecraft . His great hands were shaped for sword hilt and lance shaft rather than pen or parchment . Recklessly he had sold the royal prerogatives in England to raise money for the crusade . He said he would have sold the city of London , if he could have found a chapman . In his veins ran the blood of Poitiers and Gascony ? the hot blood of troubadours and errant princes ? and he had lived a voluntary exile from his father 's wrath at the French court until the death of his father had brought him the crown of England on the very eve of the crusade . Fastidious , overbearing , and utterly brave , he had lived until now as a prince-adventurer . He had set out upon the crusade as if it were a new and most joyous adventure . And on the voyage he had mortally offended his careful cousin , Philip , king of France ? a youth no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven years . A patient and disillusioned soul , cowardly in the face of personal danger , but unyielding where the welfare of his kingdom was at stake . Peering into the future , pondering frontier castles and new laws , even on the crusade , Philip was the exact opposite of his errant cousin of England . Philip had pledged a truce with Richard , but Richard knew that he would break any pledge to gain an advantage . Philip begrudged the crusade that put the careful scheming of years to the hazard . While Richard exulted in the hazard , and baited his timid comrade-enemy with no gentle words . In these days Philip lingered moodily in his tent , out of  | joint with his surroundings , hearing uneasily that in this Holy Land William the Good of Sicily had died , and Frederick duke of Swabia , and the reverend archbishop of Canterbury . His cousin , the count of Flanders , lay dying , and even Richard was touched by the plague . Out of twelve thousand Scandinavians who had come in their ships , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in a single battle than in a year 's campaigning in France . Outside the ditch of the camp , crosses covered the clay knolls  --  crosses as thick as the stones in the field . In spite of that the siege engines whirred and crashed through the day and the night , and dust hung about the gray wall of Acre . Great stones soared from the crusaders ' perriers , falling upon the roofs within the city . From the Moslem engines on the wall , projectiles buried themselves a foot in the earth . The crusaders had pushed a covered ram over the filled-in fosse , against the base of the wall . And the Moslem engineers cast out dry wood , covering the leather-bound roof of the ram . They shot down Greek fire that caught in the dry wood and burned the ram . Then the crusaders rolled forward a new tower , higher than the wall , and sheathed with copper . Upon this the Moslems shot clay pots for hours . The pots broke and drenched the structure with a fluid that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them , the defenders went on shooting forth the pots ? until a flaming tree trunk was sent spinning through the air against the tower . In an instant , the whole tower burst into flames , roasting alive the men within it . The liquid in the pots had been naphtha . " These Saracens shut up in the city , " the veterans of Acre said to the newcomers , " are people of great and marvelous haughtiness . If they were not miscreants , we would say that we had never seen better men . " And the veterans spoke impatiently to the knights of France and England . " Lord God , when will the assault be given ? Here have come the most valiant kings of all Christianity , and the most able in attacking . Let God 's will be done ! "  | While Richard threshed in a fever of eagerness on his pallet ? waiting for the arrival of the bulk of his army with the siege engines ? Philip-Augustus at length gave the order to make a general assault . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the attack . You would not have been able to count all the armed men , all the goodly hauberks , all the shining helms , all the noble horses , all the white caparisonings , all the chosen knights . We had never seen so many distinguished knights , so many pennons , so many ornamented banners . They took their posts and advanced toward the wall and began to launch missiles , and attack . Before them rumbled the standard of France ? a cart drawn by mules , in the cart a staff as high as a minaret , bearing a white banner besprinkled with red , a gilt cross above it . Around the standard pressed a chosen guard of swordsmen . And that evening the standard rolled back again . The wounded were carried back , and the dead . A great stretch of the wall had been broken down , but smoke signals from Acre had warned the army of Saladin of the attack , and fierce counter-charges by the Moslem horsemen upon the camp had forced the besiegers to turn to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried sorrowfully , " what a poor blow we struck ! " And the harassed Philip-Augustus cried out to his men to avenge him upon the Moslems . For he felt the heat of fever in his veins , and his cousin the count of Flanders lay cold and lifeless in his tent where candles burned and priests watched . Another fleet put in to the shore , with the last of the French and those two captains of war , Robert earl of Leicester and Andrew of Chavigny , with the best of the English men-at-arms and King Richard 's engines . They went into the battle without a day 's respite . For the besiegers , maddened by their losses , fought now without giving or expecting mercy . They numbered nearly one hundred thousand and the broken wall was held against them by no more than six thousand Moslems . Gone were the  | days of duels and truces . Newcomers in the camp burned a Moslem prisoner alive within sight of the wall , and the garrison retaliated by burning a crusader at the stake . Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the English mined under the Accursed Tower , and the Moslems drove a tunnel out to meet them . In the night Arab swimmers carrying sacks of sulphur and Greek fire on their heads tried to pass the blockading vessels to enter the city ; they were caught in fishing nets . No more pigeons remained to carry news to Saladin , but a swimmer brought out a letter from the weary Meshtub and Karakush , commanders of the city . " We are reduced , " the letter said , " to such weakness that the city will be lost if you can not do something to aid us by the morrow . " On that day , the second of July , the Christians advanced again to attack . And Saladin came down from the hills with all his strength ? his halka , the veteran guard in yellow cloaks , the cavalry columns of ever-victorious Taki ad I ) in , the mailed mamluks of Egypt led by Al Adil , his brother . On the flanks rode the wild clans of the northern hills , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurds of the east with their lances and painted shields . Beyond them the Arab tribes hovered like birds of prey , ready to swoop in and snatch up plunder . Baba ad Din watched Saladin 's setting out , at the first dawn . " This day , " the worthy kadi said , " he would eat nothing , and he only drank some cups of liquid when he was urged by his physician . I did not assist at the battle , being kept in my tent at Al Ayadiya by sickness ; but from that place I saw it all . Twice did Al Adil charge the enemy in person this day . " He saw Saladin leading the ranks down , as far as the dark line of the Christian trench . He heard a new battle shout : " Ho ! Aid for Islam ! " The waves of cavalry swept against the line of the ditch and the mud wall , and broke up into streamlets of men that plied tiny arrows and dismounted to scramble up the glacis , sword in hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of horsemen trotted into the dust , to become little black dots that swarmed forward where the green banners flickered and the drums throbbed ceaselessly . Al Adil charged and Taki ad Din , and the dervishes ran between the horses , screaming , knives in lean hands , while the imams watching in the hills intoned an endless prayer . " This day men shall be like scattered moths , and the mountains shall become like flocks of carded wool . . . when the Earth with her quakings shall quake , and men shall say , What aileth her ? On this day shall she tell out her tidings . . . . " Moslems were breaking through the trench line ; they were wielding their swords among the tents , under that veil of dust . They were leaving their horses and breaking through . Wounded warriors drifted back , dark with sweat and drying blood , rocking in their saddles and shouting the tale of their deeds while the fever of fighting was in them . They told of Christian bodies filling the trench , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A Frank of enormous size mounted the rampart . His comrades passed stones up to him from behind . I k cast the stones down upon us . We struck that man with more than fifty blows of arrows of stones , but could not drive him from his work . He stood against us , struggling , until one of our engineers threw a glass pot of naphtha on him and burned him alive . " Baha ad Din listened to the tales . A veteran of the regular army , an old man and intelligent , came up . He had penetrated through the ditches of the unbelievers . " Behind their wall , " he said , " there was a woman , covered with a green mantle , who kept shooting arrows with a wooden bow . She wounded several of us . She was finally overcome by several men . We killed her and brought her bow to the sultan . He was amazed at this happening . " I lours passed , and the trench line of the Christians held fast . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until night Baha ad Din relates did the sultan return to his cant ) ) , after the last evening prayer . Broken by fatigue , and a prey to grieving , he slept . But it was not a tranquil sleep . At  | daybreak he ordered the drum beaten again . On all sides the soldiers began to form their squadrons and to take up their old tasks . Richard of England could endure idleness no more . He ordered his attendants to pick up his pallet and to carry him upon it , out to the battle . They carried it to a knoll in the front line , where a hurdle stood , roofed over with wickerwork . Through an opening in the wicker roof Richard could watch the wall of Acre , and the battered summit of the Accursed Tower at the angle where the English were attacking . Raising himself on his elbow , the sick king listened to the whir and thud of the great engines and the clang of iron darts ? the rending of wood and the clatter of steel weapons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . Calling for his crossbow ? a weapon that he handled with rare skill ? he began to speed his quarrels through the opening of the bombproof . That day the English fired the beams of the tunnel they had thrust down , under the foundations of the square tower . Smoke oozed up through the holes in the earth . Slowly the tower inclined outward : it settled into the earth and leaned toward the besiegers , but it did not fall . Richard summoned a herald to him . " Two gold byzants to the man who brings me a stone from yonder tower ! " he said , and the trumpeter proclaimed it from the knoll beside him . The men within hearing looked at the leaning tower , still manned by Moslem archers , and hung back . The king offered three and then four gold pieces for a stone , and groups of the English dropped their arms to run forward with iron bars and hammers , under the speeding arrows . Some of them were shot down , and others fled ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with them to the king . At twilight the Accursed Tower still stood . Through the hours of darkness men labored around it like ghouls in a great cemetery of stones . From the Christian lines they  | crept forward to throw the bodies of their dead comrades into the maw of the half-filled fosse . Thither they dragged carcases of horses , beams , and rocks . With sword and ax other shadows of men stood guard over them . Peering into the haze of moonlight , helmeted archers on the broken wall above them shot at the moving shadows . From the yawning breaches of the wall barefoot Moslems , wraiths tortured by hunger and lack of sleep , stole out and felt their way along the darkness of the fosse . They carried axes and long knives and when they came to the body of a man or the stiffened cadaver of a horse they hacked at the limbs until they could wrench them off and pass them back to other laborers , who carried their burden back into the alleys of Acre , and cast them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shadows worked to fill up the great ditch , while others toiled to clear it . The Accursed Tower was down at last , in clouds of smoke and drifting dust . A wide hole gaped in the angle of the gray city wall . And , as ants swarm forth to mend a break in the clay barrier of an ant hill , weary men thronged from the city to tug stones into place , one upon the other ? to build a barricade out of dismembered bodies and the broken beams of engines ; while other figures ran into the settling dust , to tear apart the barricade . With them went the banners of Leicester and Chavigny and the good bishop of Salisbury . Sword in hand , they climbed over the stones , smiting and hacking and pressing on . From straining throats came a hoarse cry : " Christ and the Sepulcher ! " Through the barricade they broke , stumbling and falling under the arrows that sped down from the heights around them . Back to back they stood in the welter of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners rose in the breach , and the distant watchers shouted : " St. George for England ! " One figure pushed ahead of the others . A knight , Aubery Clement , had sworn that he would enter Acre or die that day . And he went down under a counter-charge of desperate  | Turks , who fought with knives and broken swords to hold the breach until others came up with flame throwers . Sheets of flame licked out at the attackers , and burning naphtha drenched them . Scorched and tortured , men who would have stood their ground against steel fell back into the debris of the fosse , or stumbled clear of the wall . So were the English beaten back from the breach while the tired Turks shouted in mockery . But it was the last of the fire and almost the last of the garrison 's strength . On Friday , the twelfth of July , a swimmer from the city reached the outer shore and was brought to Saladin , with a letter from the commanders in Acre . The letter Baha ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last extremity ? too weak to defend the breach which was very great . Only death awaited them , and they did not doubt that all of them would be massacred if the city were carried by assault . So they had made a treaty to surrender the place . After reading it , Saladin summoned his officers at once to council in the field . When they had talked together , the sultan called the swimmer again and gave him a message disapproving the terms of the treaty . Saladin left the council without speaking to any one . That night he remained sitting in troubled abstraction , when all at once we saw fires lighted on the wall of the city ? and the banners and crosses of the enemy . Their fires of joy lighted all the rampart . Acre had fallen .  | WITH the surrender of the city a change came over the survivors of the Christian host . Under the burning midsummer sun the siege engines were left standing unattended , like captive giants bound with ropes and chains , and now at last permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored for months without respite put aside their armor and drank of idleness as a thirst-ridden traveler quaffs deep of wine in the cool of the evening . They took possession of their old quarters in the city , and watched the throng of Moslem prisoners working with brushes and pails of water , scrubbing the whitewash from the walls of the cathedral that had been a mosque . Under the white coating appeared the familiar mosaic figures of the saints , as if they had been waiting there these four years to welcome the Christians . The great army of Christians felt the relaxation from the strain ; it slept fitfully at first and then heavily , dulling the memory of pain and agonizing losses . It tried not to think of the . graves that covered the plain ? graves that held the bodies of three reigning princes , six archbishops and patri- archs , forty counts , and five hundred men of noble rank . And perhaps eighty thousand common men . ' The price paid for Acre had been too great , but the survivors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surely now the way was open to Jerusalem . Meanwhile , relaxing , the men who put aside their armor became individuals again with ambitions and grievances of their own . The men-at-arms settled old debts and went out to look for taverns . Courtly dress appeared again in the streets , where esquires rode in attendance upon their ladies . Other women came down from Tyre , and of nights the tinkling of gitterns , the clinking of cups , and the melody of the troubadours could be heard . And the leaders assembled in a great council to settle the question of the kingship of Jerusalem that had divided them into two factions . No idle question this ? for in the hand of the king lay the authority of God . In this council sat Philip-Augustus in his somber dress , his young face prematurely lined . Beside him the longlimbed Richard , in a rose-hued vest and hunting cap , his great sword in its plain sheath linked to his girdle with silver . He played with the staff in his hand , alert and amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the quiet earl of Leicester , and Henry , count of Champagne ? nephew of the two kings but a poor man . " Living from morning to morning , " the chroniclers say . With the English sat the Templars in their white surcoats , and the three brothers Lusignan ? Guy , the king in name ; Geoffrey , the warrior ; and Amalric , the constable . With the French were the dark-faced Pisans , and the nobleman who had caused the quarrel , Conrad of Montserrat , inscrutable , unyielding , and swift to seize upon any gain . He had already scored a decisive advantage over the help- less Guy . A year ago Queen Sibyl , the bride of Lusignan , had died in the camp . By the ruling of the high court of the barons in such a case , the younger sister of the dead woman succeeded to the throne . But Isabel was married ? during that stormy evening at Kerak ? to the mild and unkingly Humphrey of Toron . Isabel , only twenty years of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be separated from him . But her mother and Conrad 's agents beset her , troubling the girl 's conscience by insinuating that her marriage to Humphrey was no marriage because it had taken place before her age of puberty . She yielded at last , and the Church declared the marriage null . Whereupon Conrad claimed her and wedded her and at once demanded recognition of his right to the throne of Jerusalem , since Isabel was now the queen . There were ugly whispers that the marquis already had a wife in Constantinople , with another at home in Italy . " In reserve , " explains Ambrose , who hated him . " And now he married a third ! That is why the good archbishop did not fear to say that God was not present at such a wedding . " All these remonstrances the ambitious Italian brushed aside . The daring Geoffrey , brother of Guy , cast down his gauntlet before the marquis and Conrad ignored it . The Templars insisted that Guy was the rightful king , but Conrad gained the ear of Philip-Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard 's conquest of the rich island of Cyprus . ( The careless Richard had accepted Guy 's side of the quarrel , and , while he gave up the half of Cyprus , he opposed Philip-Augustus in the matter of the kingship . The crusade had fanned the latent enmity between the twain , and Richard openly sought the leadership of the army . ) Now in the great council the cause was debated gravely ? for the kingship of Jerusalem was perhaps the highest of earthly honors ? and a compromise was reached . Guy would have the kingdom during his lifetime , after which it would fall to the marquis or his son . If Conrad died first , King Richard would dispose of the kingdom as he pleased , if he were still in the East .  | So they agreed . Two things are clear . The barons of Jerusalem no longer had in their hands the choosing of the king , as in the time of the first Baldwin ; and the politics of the West had crept into the East . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ibelin and Humphrey of Toron belonged to the lineage of the first crusaders . The Templars had great influence , but the leadership of the crusade now lay between the kings of France and England , supported as they were by the powerful princes of Europe . After the council Philip-Augustus announced his decision . Richard 's knight errantry had exhausted his patience , perhaps , but he longed to take advantage of the death of the count of Flanders and to have the first hand in affairs at home . Under the excuse of illness , he meant to sail back to France at once . Naturally , the French contingents protested , and the other barons urged him to abide until the end of the war . The politic king did consent to leave at Acre the bulk of his soldiers under command of the duke of Burgundy . He would not stay . So great was his desire to make haste that he begged two swift galleys from Richard . No protest came from Richard , although even that singleminded warrior scented danger in the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep the faith he had pledged to him and would do no injury to the vassals or the lands of England , while Richard was absent . The king of France took the oath readily , and broke it as readily before the year was out . " Instead of blessings , " says Ambrose , " maledictions followed him upon his departure . " Be that as it may , Richard Plantagenet was happy ? well and hale once more , with no one to hinder him and all Palestine open to him . Alone Conrad dared question his acts , and Conrad , following a policy of his own , saw fit to retire into his citadel of Tyre , taking with him the Moslem hostages who had fallen to the share of the French king ; nor would he emerge at the Lion Heart 's summons . For better or worse Richard became leader of the crusade .  | His unbounded energy brought new spirit into the war , and the first result of it was the massacre . Acre had surrendered upon hard terms . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to the surrender of the place with all it held , to the payment of a ransom of 2o0,000 pieces of gold , to the release by Saladin of i , 600 Christian captives ? 100 knights selected by name among them ? and to the return of the holy cross . Saladin had been troubled when he learned the conditions . The fulfilment of course rested with him , since some three thousand of the garrison with the two commanders were held as hostages by the crusaders . He had asked what time would be allowed him to make the payment , and had been informed that he would have three months ? one third of the conditions to be met at the end of each month . Now the first month had elapsed , and the crusaders were eagerly awaiting the sight of the true cross , taken at the battle of Hattin . Whenever Moslem parties appeared near Acre , men ran out crying : " The cross is coming ! " But it did not come . Instead Saladin sent a message , explaining that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give hostages on their part to guarantee that they would release the prisoners at the end . Richard , in refusing this , demanded that Saladin make the payment without any conditions . ' Days passed , and no response came from the hills . We do not know what Saladin thought , or what he was preparing to do . Doubtless he distrusted the crusaders , and probably he was waiting for the arrival of some of the captives .  | But there is no doubt as to what Richard did . Calling a council of the princes in Acre , he discussed the situation and came to a decision . Twenty-six hundred Moslems of the garrison were led out into the plain to a kind of enclosure of blankets hung upon cords . Their hands were bound and they were put to death by the sword ? or hung ? within sight of the Moslem patrols watching from the hills . Of all the hostages only the higher officers were spared . In a frenzy of anger all the Moslem cavalry within summons rode down at the crusaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the plain . Eventually the Moslems withdrew , to carry the tidings to Saladin . Beyond doubt , he had not expected this . The massacre depressed him deeply , and not for many a long day did he show mercy to any crusaders taken captive . Ile did not , however , retaliate by a slaughter of the Christians already in his hands . Richard 's callous act roused intense feeling among the Moslems . By the letter of the agreement he had the right to act as he did . It must be remembered also that the crusaders were still afflicted by their losses at Acre ? that the majority of them , arriving on the coast during the tension of the siege , still looked upon their enemies as infidels to be slaughtered wherever met . Granting this , the fact remains that Richard stained his name and honor by this needless cruelty , and that Saladin did not retaliate except in the open war that followed . The slaughter had its afternote of comedy . The two Moslem commanders of Acre were held for individual ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 8,000 pieces of gold , while Karakush was thought by the crusaders to be worth 30,000 . It occurred to Meshtub to ask the figure set for the ransom of his brother-in-arms , and his captors told him . " I am worth as much as he , " Meshtub protested . " By God , Karakush will not bring 30,000 pieces if I bring only eight . " The knights laughed , and raised the old Kurd 's ransom to 30,000 pieces . Meanwhile Richard was preparing to march on Jerusalem .  | By common consent the crusaders placed themselves under his orders , although he had been on the coast for only two months . As king of England he was of higher birth than the remaining lords , and the command lay with him by right ; but Richard Plantagenet would have taken the lead of any army in which he served . It is no easy matter to perceive the real Richard , to separate him from the minstrelsy of the centuries . We would like to know the exact nature of the man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indistinct ? scarred and dimmed by time . This much we know . Richard was born late in life to Eleanor of Guinne , who had been the queen of Louis , one of the leaders of the crusade of 1149 ? Eleanor whose wilfulness preyed upon this monarch of the French until Louis abandoned the crusade and divorced her . No untoward fortune could dishearten the beautiful Eleanor , who chose for her second husband Henry of Anjou , cunning , passionate , and cruel . She could don man 's garments and go out against adversity ; she dared rebel against her husband after he had been anointed king of England . Henry , able enough in all conscience , defied the Church of Rome , and went to his death with his sons in arms against him and the stigma of Herod upon him , after the murder of good Thomas a Becket . The children grew up amid turmoil and the quarrels of the courts , tasting of vice at an early age . John , weak and covetous , inherited his father 's nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lie was her favorite . We have only glimpses of him , matching songs with the troubadours of Poitiers , standing silent beside his father 's body , without a word of blame or promise of good-will to the English barons who had fought against him . He plunges into the crusade , as if longing to bury all this futile past in a selfless venture ; he desires Berengaria of Navarre for wife , and yet sails from Messina on the very eve of her expected arrival in the charge of Eleanor . And after their marriage he avoids her ? places her with Joanna his sister , rescued from Sicily , and the fair Byzantine girl , daughter of the Comnene , held by him as hostage . Seemingly he takes delight in the young Byzantine prin- cess ? perhaps makes her his mistress . Berengaria follows him without protest , silent in her pride . The three women ? shadows behind the resplendent figure of the crusader king ? are housed with all splendor in the palace at Acre . They appear at banquets , and Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern jewels . He is no whit dismayed by the losses at Acre or the desertion of Philip . The thing in hand engrosses him , and he exults in the preparations for the march , buying new soldiery from the French , inspecting the ships . He can order the slaying of the Moslem hostages , and still send requests to Saladin for food for his falcons . He is childishly disappointed that the sultan will not meet him face to face in courteous talk before the coming battle . Passing from hunting field to the banquet table , jesting with men of all ranks , spurring on the laggards , beating down all opposition ? such is the outward bearing of the man , on the eve of the struggle . At times he is moody , and over-tensed nerves give way before little things . He has a Norman 's canniness , and never did crusader cast such stakes upon the board as Richard . To come thus far , he has drained England and left his kingdom at hazard . He means no doubt to win such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return and mend matters in the West . But he finds great powers opposing him at every step , and he is impatient . So for a moment the two adversaries gather their strength for the coming struggle ? the champion of the West preparing to go forth to meet the lord of the nearer East . In every quality they are opposed : Saladin has the clear vision of age , Richard the heedlessness of youth ; Saladin is patient , Richard impetuous ; Saladin , unable to take part in person in the fighting , relies upon generalship ; Richard depends upon his own prowess in battle . The sultan , a fatalist , will take long chances ? he has men fit only for striking , not for defense ; the king must feel the ground before each new step , but he has men equally effective in attack or defense . Either of them would give his life to hold , or to take , Jerusalem . Richard made the first move , a wise one . Instead of seek- ing Saladin or marching inland , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward Jaffa , the port of Jerusalem . A distance of some sixty-five miles as the crow flies , rather more than a hundred along the trails . He set out on August twenty-fifth of that year 1191 during the worst of the heat when the streams were dry . Saladin kept in touch with his movements by spies and by mounted patrols . He ordered the walls of the three towns between Acre and Jaffa dismantled , and the fortifications of that seaport destroyed . And he marched south beside the crusaders , out of sight within the hills .  | AT FIRST the Christian army did not move smoothly . In fact , it did not move at all . Acre sheltered a great multitude , speaking different languages and following different leaders . For weeks this multitude had rested in the shade of the poplars and the palm groves . " In the town , " Ambrose explains , " were good wines and girls , many of whom were very fair . They gave themselves up to the wine and the women until the valiant men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch his tents by the sand dunes of the river and send back his marshals to rout out the malingerers . They emerged peevishly , overburdened with baggage . And onsets of Moslem cavalry added to the confusion . For two days the crusaders camped in the shadow of Mount Carmel ? from the summit of which Saladin had been inspecting them ? while the useless gear was discarded and the men formed into companies . All women except hardy workers were sent back , and each man was given ten days ' supplies of biscuit , cereal , wine , and meat to carry in a pack . This done , the great standard , an effigy of a dragon mounted upon an iron- bound pole in a heavy cart , trundled forward within its guard of Norman swordsmen . With the Templars leading , the army crawled around the point of Carmel in close array . Ambrose marched with them , delighted at the sight . You would see there great chivalry , The fairest younglings , The chosen men , most proud , That ever were beheld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armorings , And old sergeants , hardy and proud , So many swords fair seeming , So many banners gleaming You would see there a host afoot , Greatly to be feared . Burdened by the heavy packs , the army trudged through the dry brush and thickets of the shore , surprised to see so many animals scurrying away before it . Scorpions and snakes worried the newcomers , and every day before setting out the sun emerged from the ridge on the left hand , making a glaring furnace of the sky , reflecting on the sand and even touching the tranquil green sea with fire . The army clambered past the limestone ledges of the Narrow Way , fearing that the Moslems would beset it . But the sand and the brush lay empty before it , as far as the ruins of Capernaum . The army advanced only a few miles each day , halting at an early hour to camp . When the men had eaten supper , and the sun had sunk beneath red clouds into a purple sea , the air became cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and call out the familiar words : " Holy Sepulcher , aid us ! " Others would take up the cry after him , repeating it as far as the outer lines where the silent Templars kept watch in mounted patrols . Ambrose said it refreshed them all ? as did the sight of the stalwart Richard by day , mounted on Fauvel , his bay Cyprian horse .  | The army trudged on , down the silent coast where no sheep grazed , and no wind stirred the dust , and even the thickets were gray and salt and bitter . At the empty town of Caesarea the fleet appeared , moving slowly under listless airs over the tideless water . It brought supplies and the last laggards from Acre . The army a chronicle relates pitched its tents by a river called the River of Crocodiles , because the crocodiles devoured two soldiers who bathed in it . Caesarea is great in size , and the buildings wonderful in workmanship . Our Savior with His disciples often visited it and worked miracles there . But the Turks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army turned a little inland ? for the line of the menacing hills had receded , and the leaders decided to follow the wells and cultivated land a few miles from the shore . ( And here , Baha ad Din relates , Saladin made a survey of the country ahead of the crusaders and talked for a long time apart with his brother Al Adil . ) On leaving Caesarea the Moslem cavalry appeared , skirmishing with the rear guard and harassing the crusaders with arrows . But Richard or his advisers had hit upon a formation that fairly baffled the eager foemen . The crusaders marched in three columns . The one nearest the hills ? and the Moslems ? was formed entirely of infantry , in close order . Those in the outer files exposed to the Moslem arrows carried bows and crossbows and wore shirts of felt and mail . They worked their bows without halting , and their armor shielded them from the hostile arrows . Within these files , their comrades carried spears and swords in readiness to stand and beat off a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up of the knights and horsemen , the real strength of the army ? protected in this fashion from the arrows that would otherwise have taken toll of the valuable horses . Nearest the sea and remote from the Moslems marched the third column with the carts and baggage and sick . These men could take their ease , and a division of them changed  | places every few hours with the infantry of the first column , who could then rest in their turn . The fighting of the first day ended at noon when both sides wilted under the trying heat . The crusaders kept on , across a barren stretch of sand dunes , and came to a narrow ravine , a portion of which the Moslems had thoughtfully camouflaged with a screen of branches to trap the horsemen of the advance . But the Templars were not deceived , and after testing the water and finding it good , they camped there . The river they christened the Dead River . On the next day the chronicle continues the army went on slowly through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day and they lost so many horses through the attacks of the Turks , they were almost reduced to despair . The king also was wounded in the side by a javelin while he was driving the Turks . Alas , how many horses fell pierced with javelins ! This terrible tempest kept up all day , until at twilight the Turks returned to their tents . Our people stopped near what was called the Salt River . A great throng gathered on account of the horses which had died from their wounds , for the people were so eager to purchase the horseflesh that they even came to blows . The king , hearing this , proclaimed by herald that he would give a live horse to whoever had lost his horse and who distributed the flesh of it to the best men in his command , who had most need of it . On the third day our army marched in battle array from the Salt River ; for there was a rumor that the Turks were lying in ambush in a forest , and that they meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advancing in order , passed the place unmolested where the ambuscade was said to be . On quitting the wood they came to a large plain and there they pitched their tents . Spies , however , brought back word that the Turks lay ahead of them in countless numbers . Saladin had inspected this plain with Al Adil , and had chosen it for the hazard of battle . In the last two days his horsemen had tried to coax the crusaders ' cavalry out of the protecting mass of infantry , and had failed . We had to admire Baha ad Din says the patience shown by these people , who endured the worst fatigues without having military skill or any advantage on their side .  | The Moslems , being all mounted , outnumbered the crusaders ' horsemen at least five to one . Their purpose was to induce the men of the cross to break their array ? to abandon the hedgehog-like formation and to scatter over the countryside , in which case the charges of the Turkish cavalry might overwhelm them . Richard , understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ranks under any provocation unless the signal was given to charge ? the simultaneous blast of trumpets down the line . So on that day of battle the Christians moved forward in their dense column , like an armored giant drawing himself painfully over the ground , heedless of the sting of missiles . The Templars took the advance again , followed by the Bretons and the knights of Anjou ; King Guy led the men of Poitou at their heels , and the Normans and English pressed after with the standard . Bearing the burden of the attack , the black-robed Hospitalers held the rear . At nine o'clock , when the crusaders were already drenched with sweat , the two sides were engaged ? swarms of Bedawins and the negro horsemen of Egypt assailing the rear . King Richard and the duke of Burgundy with their retinues rode up and down the line , to steady the men . The enemy relates the chronicler De Vinsouf thundered at their backs as if with mallets , so that , having no room to use their bows , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks , echoing from their metal armor , resounded as if they had struck upon an anvil . They were now tormented with the heat , and no rest was allowed them . The battle fell heavily on the extreme line of the Hospitalers ? the more so as they were unable to resist . They moved forward with patience under their wounds , and the Turks cried out that they were iron , and would yield to no blow . Then about twenty thousand Turks rushed upon our men . Almost overcome by their savage fury Garnier de Napes , one of the Hospitalers , suddenly exclaimed with a loud voice , " O St. George , wilt thou leave us to be driven thus ? " Upon this the master of the Hospitalers went to the king and said to him , " My lord the king , we are pressed by the enemy , and in danger of eternal infamy ; we are losing our horses , one after the other , and why should we bear with them ? "  | " Good Master , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attack . No one can be everywhere at once . " On the master returning , there was not a count or prince who did not blush for shame , and they said one to the other , " Why do we not charge them at full gallop ? " Thereupon two knights who were impatient of delay put everything in confusion . They rushed at full gallop upon the Turks and each of them overthrew his man , by piercing him with his lance . One of them was the marshal of the Hospitalers , the other was Baldwin de Carreo , a good and brave man and the companion of King Richard . ' When the other Christians observed these two rushing forward , and heard them calling with a clear voice on St. George for aid , they charged the Turks in a body with all their strength ; then the Hospitalers who had been distressed all day by their close array , following the two soldiers , charged the enemy in troops ? so that the van of the army became the rear and the Hospitalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count of Champagne also burst forward with his chosen company , and James d'Avesnes with his kinsmen , and the bishop of Beauvais , as well as the earl of Leicester , who made a fierce charge on the left , toward the sea . The Turks , who had dismounted from their horses in order to take better aim at our men with their javelins and arrows , were slain on all sides in that charge , for , being overthrown by the horsemen , they were killed by the footmen who followed . King Richard , on seeing his army in motion , flew on his horse through the Hospitalers , and broke into the Turkish infantry , who were astonished at his blows and those of his men , and gave way to the right and the left . Then might be seen numbers prostrate on the ground , horses in swarms without their riders , and many trodden under foot by friend and foe . Oh , how different is battle from the speculations of those who meditate amid the columns of the cloisters ! There the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks ; wherever he turned , he cut a wide path for himself , like a  | reaper with his sickle . The rest , warned by the sight , gave him wide room . For a long time the battle was doubtful . Oh , how many banners might be seen , torn and fallen to the earth ; how many swords of proved steel covering the ground ! Some of the Turks hid themselves in copses , others climbed the trees , and , being shot with arrows , fell with a groan to the earth ; others , abandoning their horses , betook themselves to slippery foot paths . For a space of two miles nothing could be seen but fugitives . Our men paused , but the fugitives , to the number of twenty thousand , when they saw this , recovered their courage and charged the hindmost of our men who were retiring . Oh , how dreadfully were our men then pressed ! They bent , stunned , to their saddle bows . Then you might have seen horses without saddles , and the Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an admiral , Tekedmus , a kinsman of the sultan ; he had seven hundred Turks of great valor from the household troops of Saladin , each of whose companies bore a yellow banner . " These men , coming at full charge with haughty bearing , attacked our men so that even the firmness of our leaders wavered under the weight of the pressure . The battle raged fiercer than before ? the one side labored to crush , the other to repel . For all that , the king , mounted on a bay Cyprian steed , scattered those he met , while helmets tottered beneath his sword . The enemy gave way before his sword , and thus our men , having suffered somewhat , returned to the standard . They proceeded on their march as far as Arsuf , and there they pitched their tents outside its walls . While they were thus engaged , a large body of the Turks made an attack upon the extreme rear of our army . King Richard with only fifteen companions rushed against these Turks , crying out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " When our men heard it , they made haste to follow him , and attacked the Turks , putting them to flight . Overcome with the fatigues of the day , our men rested quietly that night . Whoever wished to plunder returned to the field of battle , and those who returned thence reported that they had counted thirty-two Turkish chieftains slain . The Turks also made search for them . But we had to mourn greatly the loss of James d'Avesnes . On Sunday the Hospitalers and knights of the " Temple armed them- selves and made anxious search , and at last found the body , its face so covered with clotted blood that it was difficult of recognition . Thus , having decently wrapped up the body , they bore it back to Arsuf whence a great multitude of the soldiers came forth to meet it . So ended Saladin 's attempt to break the array of the crusaders in open battle . The sallying forth of two knights , against Richard 's orders , took the Moslems by surprise , and the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills with heavy losses . In this charge the men of Islam experienced for the first time the astonishing might of the Lion Heart , and Malik Ric gained for himself a place in Moslem legendry that endures even to-day . But counter-charges led by Taki ad Din and others made the crusaders retire into their close order , and move on without delay to the sheltering gardens of the little seaport of Arsuf . On the following day Saladin appeared , ready to renew the action , while the crusaders did not take the field . This affair of Arsuf was hardly a battle , and certainly not a decisive battle , as some historians have made it out , in the past . It did prove , however , that the crusaders under Richard 's leadership could hold their own in ranged battle against Saladin 's forces , and it lowered the morale of the Moslem soldiery . And it caused Saladin and his generals to change their plan of campaign . Instead of hanging on the flank of the Christians to draw them into action , Saladin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , determined to play for time . To do this he destroyed instead of defending Ascalon , the Bride of Syria . Ascalon , the southern key to Jerusalem and to the caravan route into Egypt , was a great and fair seaport , hut the Moslem amirs were in no mood to shut themselves up in another Acre , to defend it . " 1 take God to witness , " Saladin said , " I would rather lose all my children than cast down a stone from its walls , but ? it is necessary . "  | He drove his men to the grim work , recruiting an army of workmen . When these laborers entered the city Baba ad Din relates there went up a great sound of grieving ; for the city was pleasant to look upon ; its walls were strong , its houses beautiful . Its people began at once to sell everything they could not bear away with them into Egypt , even selling ten hens for one dirhem . They came out to the camp with their wives and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on foot , lacking money to hire beasts to carry them . The troops , worn out with fatigue , spent that night in their tents . This was a horrible time . From early morning the sultan busied himself in the work of tearing down . He gave all the corn stored in the city to the workmen . They set fire to the houses of the city . All the towers were filled with wood and burned . For two days the sultan was so ill that he could not ride or take any food . He shifted the camp close to the walls , which enabled the camel and ass drivers to share in the work . For he feared that the Franks would hear of it and come down to forestall him .  | RICHARD 'S impetuous spirit was fired by the withdrawal of the Moslems . " Seigneurs , " he cried in the first conference at Jaffa , " the Turks are destroying Ascalon ? they dare not give battle to us . Let us go , to save this city . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olive groves , swept by the dry north wind . The horses grazed hungrily in the fertile fields by the canals , and the men ate eagerly of the ripe grapes and fresh figs and almonds . They rested , in Jaffa ? some of them even went back by boat to the fleshpots of Acre ? and debated what ought to be done . It seemed to them that the wall of Jaffa must be repaired first . And Richard , so skilled in battle , so certain of himself in the face of the enemy , could not sway the minds of the council . Impatiently his thoughts turned to the great leaders of the Moslems , off yonder behind the haze of dust that half veiled the brown rampart of the hills . 1 le sent an envoy for Al Adil , the counselor and brother of the sultan . Al Adil came , courteous and watchful , at the head of a brilliant cortege of horsemen . Richard rode out to meet him , attended by Norman knights , with youthful Humphrey of Toron to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " has lasted a long time between us . On both sides a multitude of brave warriors have fallen . As for us , we are come only to aid the Franks of this coast . Make peace with them , and the two armies will retire , each into its own country . " Al Adil was apt at this fencing with words . Quietly he demanded upon what terms the Christians would make peace , and Richard , perforce , answered ? saying that Jerusalem must be yielded up , and the Moslems must retire beyond the Jordan . With pride , Al Adil refused . This meeting was reported at once to Saladin , and he wrote to his brother , " Try to drag out matters longer with the Franks and keep them where they are , until the Turkoman reinforcements which are on the way have joined us . " So Al Adil , summoned again by the English king , brought a great pavilion with him , and gifts of camels and saddled horses , and his cooks with a store of dainties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward his own tent , and the two feasted therein ? the Moslem cooks fetching their dishes into the crusader 's quarters . Richard prepared the feast with splendor and returned gift for gift . Quite frankly he admired Al Adil , finding that this lord of the pagans who could tell a merry tale or eat a whole sheep at a sitting knew all the lore of hunt and falconry ? that his pride was not less than Norman pride . Such a man could entertain the Lion Heart more than the wayward French barons , or the monkish Templars who labored at the stones of Jaffa . Thereafter Richard often sent to the Moslem chieftain for sherbet or ? when fever settled upon him ? snow from the distant peak of Hermon . Always Al Adil responded courteously , while he studied Richard . Months later Richard was to make a friendly gesture in recognition of Al Adil 's courtesy . ' He sent for the elder son of the Moslem prince and knighted him with all solemnity before the Christian lords . For the present , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly took Al Adil 's breath away . It seemed to the English king that a marriage might mend all the questions at issue ? the marriage of his sister Joanna to the cultured and affable Al Adil . This done , he on behalf of the crusaders ? and Saladin ? on behalf of the Moslems ? would surrender their mutual holdings in the Holy Land to the new couple and Jerusalem would be held in peace by both sides , with pilgrims at liberty to come and go . The true cross would be returned to the crusaders . So Richard suggested , apparently with all sincerity . Al Adil was a little dazzled when he reported the offer to his brother . " Wilt thou accept ? " Baha ad Din asked the sultan curiously . " Yes , verily , " Saladin said , thrice ? and smiled . He knew the thing to be impossible , and eventually Richard had to announce that his sister refused to marry a Moslem . Not that Richard was idle . The skirmishing going on between the horsemen of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He went out with a small following to look for hostile patrols and ride them down . The king of England Ambrose explains went out to meet the Saracens , hoping to surprise them , but once the thing turned out badly . The king had too few with him , and it happened that he went to sleep . The Saracens were on their-guard , and approached so near that he was barely awakened in time . Seigneurs , do not be surprised if he got up in great haste ? for a single man beset by so many is not at ease . But the grace of God enabled him to mount his horse : his people mounted also , but they were too few . When the Turks saw them in the saddle they turned and fled to their ambuscade , pursued by the king . Those who were hidden in the ambush rushed out and tried to seize the king upon his horse Fauvel , but he drew his sword . All around him the Turks pressed ? each one wishing to put hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword . If they had known who he was , they would have taken him . But one of his knights , William of Priux a loyal man and proud , cried out , " I am  | the malik . " That is to say , the king . The Turks seized him at once and carried him off to their army . There were killed Renier de Maron , who had a valiant heart , and his nephew . Alan and Lucas of the Stable were killed also ? that is the truth . No one pursued the Turks , for they went away in a great body , leading William a captive . When God had thus spared the king , several , knowing his courage and being fearful for him , begged of him : " Sire , for God , do not thus ! It is not your affair to go on such expeditions . You lack not brave men ? do not go forth alone on such occasions , for all our lives depend upon you . " More than one valiant man took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of a combat ? and very little could be hidden from him ? he cast himself always against the Turks . Once the Templars were guarding the foragers , when four squadrons of Turks fell upon them with loose bridles . The combat was at its height when King Richard arrived . He saw our people surrounded by the pagans . He had only a few with him , but valiant men and chosen , several of whom said to him : " In truth , Sire , you risk a great misfortune . Never can you bring our people out of there , and it is better that they die than that you perish with them . " The king changed color , and said , " I have sent them thither ? I asked them to go . If they die there without me , may I never again be called king ! " He gave his horse the spurs and loosened the rein ; swifter than a hawk he cast himself at the Saracens , and broke through them to the center . He drove them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severing their heads and arms . They fled like beasts . Many who could not flee were taken or killed . Our men pursued them so long that it was the hour to return to camp . Some men , however , blamed him because of the presents he had accepted from the pagans . But he would have delivered the Holy Land if he had not been prevented . October had passed , and November , while Jaffa was rebuilt and fresh contingents summoned up from Acre . The orange groves around Jaffa were heavy with fruit , and the feather grass blew brittle over the plain , under cloudy skies . Along the line of the hills the dust veil whirled when the north wind blew . Little by little the crusaders had penetrated the plain ,  | quartering themselves in dismantled towers and riding into the empty towns . They had gained the edge of the foothills , and before them the road to Jerusalem ascended among barren gullies twisting and turning around the shoulders of the hills toward the Holy City , hidden from sight twelve miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on the heels of the wind , and chilled the air . The bulk of the crusaders expected to march forward to Jerusalem , while the leaders , realizing the difficulties , had no plan at all , and Richard could not think of one . The days became cold Ambrose relates . The rain and the hail beat against us , overturning our tents . We lost there , before and after Christmas , many of our horses , while the storms rotted our salt pork and melted the biscuits . The shirts of mail were covered with rust , and many of us fell ill from lack of food . But their hearts were joyous because of the hope they had , of going to the Holy Sepulcher . Those who were sick at Jaffa and other places had themselves placed in litters and brought out to the camp . And in the camp gladness reigned  --  they lifted their helmets and tossed their heads , crying , " Our Lady , holy Virgin Mary , aid us ! O Lord , allow us to worship and thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high men and the captains decided that every one must go back to Ascalon , and rebuild its walls . When the news was known in the host , no one ever saw a host so troubled and so sad . Their joy ? when they had thought to go to the Sepulcher ? was not so great as this new grief . Some of them could not hold their peace , and cursed the long halt and the camp . All the host was discouraged . They did not know how to carry back the supplies they had brought thither , because the pack animals were enfeebled by the cold and storms . When they were loaded , they fell on their knees , and men cursed them , consigning them to the devil . Finally every one departed and that day we arrived at Ramlah.  | At Ramlah was the host , and because of the discouragement , it separated . Many of the French went away , with the duke of Burgundy . The king with his nephew the count Henry of Champagne went on to Ibelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little after midday they reached Ascalon , which they found broken down and destroyed ? they had to climb over debris to enter it . Saladin knew by his spies that our people had returned to the shore of the sea ; then he said to his Saracens that they could go away to their country and rest until May . They went willingly , having remained four whole years in Syria . Although Richard labored at rebuilding Jaffa , the first weeks of the new year 1192 saw the crusaders thoroughly disorganized . The French , their supplies and money exhausted , besought the English king for a loan ; the duke of Burgundy went from Richard 's side to talk with Conrad , who was secretly negotiating with Saladin ? offering to make open war on Richard if the sultan would pledge him more of the coast cities . The Normans and English mocked the French , saying that they held wine goblets instead of swords in their hands , and that they filled the houses of the prostitutes in Acre so that their comrades had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pisans who had given sturdy aid from the first now had time to covet the coast ports and to brood upon their ancient feud , and they started a war of their own in the streets of Acre , pulling the duke from his horse when he tried to intervene . Richard rode in haste up to the rioting , and managed to bring some order out of chaos . He assembled all the captains in conference , and listened to their grievances . And he had to taste the dregs of his own failure to lead them . Because they explained that they were weary of delay and of the figurehead of Guy , who could never be a king in deed ? they thought the only man who could make head against the Moslems was Conrad of Montserrat . They wanted Conrad to bring the factions together and to lead them as king of Jerusalem ? so they pleaded , on their knees . In silence Richard heard them . Like a bird of ill omen ,  | word had come over the sea from England . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bishop of Ely , and he knew that his affairs in England went badly . His brother , the earl John , had driven out his chancellor and seized upon the exchequer . He listened to the crusaders , and dismissed from his mind his own quarrel with Conrad , giving his assent to the election of Conrad and the retirement of Guy . To compensate the unhappy Lusignan , Richard made over to him the island of Cyprus . Messengers were sent to Tyre to announce the decision of the council , while the crusaders rejoiced , making ready their scant robes of ceremony and furbishing their arms for the coming coronation . But their rejoicing was silenced within a few days , when a strange power from beyond the mountains intervened in their affairs . Conrad , riding home from a banquet at the house of the bishop of Beauvais , was attacked by two young men without cloaks and stabbed . The Assassins who once had menaced Saladin struck down the marquis before his coronation . In the general consternation , many tales were repeated of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written years later , is the clearest . Two men of the Ismailites clad in the habit of monks rushed upon the marquis who was mounted on his horse . One of them struck him with a knife ; the other fled into a church , near by . In truth , the wounded marquis was carried into this same church by his companions . When the monk who was the companion of the assassin beheld the marquis alive and speaking , he rushed out at him in the middle of the church and struck him again , and straightway he died . These two Ismailites , seized and crucified and tortured by the Franks , said that the king of England had sent them . And because of the enmity which had been between them , the Franks believed the words of these cutthroats . However , it was manifest afterward that the sidna , chief of the Ismailites , sent them .  | The death of Conrad ? the one man Saladin feared ? healed the long feud that had divided the crusaders . At Tyre the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , riding into the city by chance , was seized upon by them as the man to take the crown awarded the dead marquis . Henry , young and amiable , had no enemies , and he was nephew to both Richard and Philip-Augustus . They urged him to marry the widowed Isabel at once . Far in the south , Richard heard the news of Conrad 's assassination while he was boar hunting , and for a space he was silent in astonishment . " Sir Sergeants , this is my word ? let Count Henry take the city of Acre and Tyre , " he said at length , " and the whole of the land , if it please God , for ever . As to his marriage with the widow , I have no advice to give , for the marquis had her unlawfully . But tell the count in my name to take the field as speedily as possible and bring the French with him . " So , after Easter-tide , Henry married the youthful Isabel , and the crusaders assembled around his standard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lion Heart remained . And the English king , determined but irresolute as always when the responsibility of a campaign was laid upon him , bethought him of sending envoys to Saladin . " Greet the sultan , " he instructed his messengers , " and  | say that the Moslems and the Franks are reduced to the last extremity , and the resources of the two sides in men and material are exhausted . " As for Jerusalem , we are determined never to give it up , so long as a single man remains to us . You must return the land to us as far as the Jordan . As for the sacred cross , to you it is a bit of wood without value ; but in our eyes it has a very great value . Will the sultan have the graciousness to send it back to us ? " After consulting with his amirs , Saladin answered : " Jerusalem is as much to us as it is to you , and has more value in our eyes ? for it was the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of assembly for our people at the Judgment Day . Do not think that we will give it up to you . The land was ours in the first place , and it is you who have come to attack it . " If you were able to take it once , that was only by surprise and owing to the weakness of the Moslems who held it then . So long as the war will last , God will not permit you to raise stone upon stone there . As for the cross , its possession is a great advantage to us , and we can not give it up except for some gain to Islam . " And to his officers the old sultan spoke emphatically : " If we make peace with these people down there , nothing will guarantee us against their bad faith . If I were to die , it would be difficult to get together such an army as this again . The best thing to do is to carry on the holy war until we have driven them out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | SUMMER came again to the Holy Land ? the fifth summer since the yellow banners of the sultan had been carried across the Jordan . Green were the foothills , where the sentinel poplars stood ; clear the streams that wound between dark cedars and shining rims of marl and red sandstone down to the lush grass where the sheep grazed , and cloaked figures watched . The herds fattened upon the good grazing and there was a sound of bees in the warm air . Only the figures of the men , alert in their watching , unwieldy in their iron sheathing , were somber and intent upon the task of war that had been begun long since by forgotten grandsires , but had not yet been finished in this quiet land . Upon them lay the burden of the war and they went on with it , turning aside from the fields that awaited the plough and the empty villages . It had become a part of them , as it had been a part of the vanished men of Antioch , and the ghosts of Hattin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and sent them forth at night where no roads led . Down in the plain the crusaders said , one man to the other , that a miracle had taken place in the Sepulcher that Eastertide . Saladin had come to the Sepulcher , to sit before the  | darkened tomb where the dark lamps hung ? and a hand invisible had lighted the lamps before the eyes of the Moslems . Surely the lighting of the lamps had been a sign and a portent . Along the plain rode King Richard and his men . They stormed the fort of Darum , and slew every Moslem within the walls . They rode on , to the gardens of Gaza , among the sand dunes . But there were whispers of messengers that summoned him home across the sea . His followers talked of a wrong-doing in England , of a composition between the earl John and King Philip by which he would lose England . Some said that he would go away , and others said that he would remain in the Holy Land to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he went , they would still go on to Jerusalem . They rejoked at that . Only the king was troubled by his thoughts . He meditated apart from his men , and flung himself alone upon his cot when his tent was pitched . At such a time one William of Poitou , a chaplain , beheld him . The chaplain walked back and forth before the tent entrance , not daring to speak to him , but weeping . The king called him in and spoke . " By thy faith , what grief makes thee weep ? " " Sire , " said the priest , " will you pledge me that you will not be angered if I speak ? " Richard pledged his word , and the chaplain mustered his courage . " Sire , they blame you . Through the host runs the rumor of your return . May the day never come , in which you will leave us. 0 King , remember what God hath done for you ? for no king of this time hath suffered less harm . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor so powerful your arm did not overthrow him . Remember the Brabacons you discomforted so often , and that good adventure at Hautefort when the count of St. Gilles besieged it . Remember how your kingdom came to you without need of shield or helmet , and how you stormed the city of Messina , and that fine exploit at Cyprus when you put an emperor in chains ? and the capture of Acre . how often hath God aided you ? Think well , 0 King , and protect this land of God .  | All of those who love you say that if you leave it without aid , it will be lost and betrayed . " Silence fell upon the tent , for those in attendance upon Richard dared not open their lips , and the king uttered no word . Chin on hand , the red-haired king meditated , and the chaplain stole away . The next day the Lion Heart summoned his herald and bade him go through the host , before the gates of Ascalon , and proclaim that for no earthly quarrel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming Easter . And that all should make ready to march on Jerusalem . And the host exulted , tumultuous as birds at the dawning of day . " Now , we shall see the Sepulcher ! " men said . The great lords hastened to put their equipment in order , and the small folk made up packs holding a month 's provisions . A long column set out upon the road , and through the dust helmets gleamed above the shields emblazoned with devices of lions or flying dragons . The marching men made haste , to Blanche Garde and the ruined Toron of the Knights , to the foothills and the hamlets of Beth Nable where they were joined by the French , at the mouth of the ravine through which winds the road to Jerusalem . Perforce they halted there , for the Moslem cavalry beset their patrols and attacked the baggage trains coming up from the coast . While the earl of Leicester and the French engaged the enemy horsemen , the host set to work shaping timbers for siege engines . But Richard found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nable rode three men in Turkish dress ? three men born in Syria and speaking the language like Moslems . They were the king 's spies and they had come from Egypt with news . The first great caravan of the summer was on its way from Cairo into the East . They had watched it winding , an endless stream of camels bound nose to tail , of mounted warriors and laden donkeys , whole families with slaves and goods , moving slowly across the dunes of the Jifar , circling far from Ascalon . Thousands of laden beasts , hundreds of armed men , forging along the desert road down to  | the Dead Sea . By now they would be passing through the bare spurs of the hills south of Hebron . Richard lost not an hour in setting out . Choosing a thousand riders and another thousand men-at-arms to sit the cruppers behind them , he mounted Fauvel that evening and headed south . A full moon climbed over the bulwark of the hills , and for a while they rode in the shadow of the heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Solitary watch towers gleamed white above them . But they had been seen . Moslem couriers galloped to Saladin , and the sultan ordered an escort to hasten down to warn the men of the caravan and to lead it away from the trail out into the blind breast of the desert . His officers outstripped the crusaders , without sighting them ? since they lay hidden in the ruined walls of a town during the next day ? and reached the caravan . But , with no danger in view , the Moslems of the caravan were reluctant to leave the road and its wells . At the end of the afternoon they camped by the well of El Khuweilfa , where the beasts were watered ? the escort of warriors going out to pitch their tents a little in advance of the multitude of the caravan that surrounded the well . At Khuweilfa there was a cistern beside the well , but even with that , it took long hours to water several thousand animals , and the caravan lay passive , after its commander gave orders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this was related to Richard by some friendly Bedawins who had come to the ruined town with their tidings , that evening . The English king thought they were lying , but he decided to go to see for himself . Taking some Turcoples for his only guard , and putting on an Arab head cloth , rings , and khufieh , he bade the Bedawins lead the way to the well . '  | Cutting across the hills and riding swiftly ? avoiding the watch towers on the trails ? they drew near El Khuweilfa after dark but before the rising of the moon . They reined in their horses and went forward slowly , and almost at once they were challenged by Arabs on a hillock . The Bedawins motioned Richard to be silent , and one of them answered the outpost . " We went toward Ascalon to see if it was God 's will that we should find plunder . Now , we go back to our place . " " Nay , " cried the voice from the darkness , " ye have come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king of England . " " Y'allah ! " the Bedawins swore . " That is a lie . " They did not check their horses , moving on toward the black shape of the caravan . Several men mounted and rode after them , but lost them in the darkness wherein scores of figures moved around the animals . Richard and his companions walked their horses around the bivouac , until they made certain of the size and situation of the encampment . Then they hastened back to the crusaders . The raiders fed their horses and ate a little themselves ; in the clear moonlight they made their way out of the hills , approaching El Khuweilfa in the murk before dawn . This was an hour that warmed Richard 's heart ? he divided his men into companies , bade the French follow on his heels , and the foot soldiers follow the knights . Lis herald went among them , warning the dark groups not to pause for any plundering . Headlong they charged into the first tents , which happened to be those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike tumbled out of their sleeping robes and ran for their horses , to be cut down by the long swords of the knights . Some of them were able to saddle their beasts , and drew off toward a height where they held their ground . Meanwhile it grew light and the crusaders sighted the main caravan , turning their attention to it at once . The plain became a chaos of swerving horses and running men , frightened camels staggering up roaring , and women screaming . Richard 's Bedawins snatched loot by the armful and  | the drivers joined forces with them . Through the confusion moved the armored forms of the great English lords , the earl of Leicester and the knights of Anjou ? for the fighting went on stubbornly until the sun rose and the mounted Moslems withdrew . They managed to take away under the eyes of the crusaders two portions of the great caravan that had camped elsewhere . But the raiders found wealth under their hands . Mule loads of spice and chests of gold and silver , with rolls of brocade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine cloths . They counted more than four thousand camels , and as many horses , and investigation yielded rare things indeed ? suits of silvered mail , and chessboards , medicines , and silver dishes . Most welcome of all was the great stock of provisions ? barley , grain , and sugar . They took five hundred prisoners , and made them lead away the laden animals . When they returned to the army at Beth Nable they were greeted joyfully , but they heard ominous tidings . Spies reported that the Moslems had destroyed the wells and filled up the springs around Jerusalem . All the exultation of the raid left Richard , hemmed in again by these multitudes of men praying to be led toward Jerusalem , while the grim Templars shook their heads . He fell moody again , watching through the hours of the nights when the sluggish face of the moon reared above the black ravine , and the cool night air stirred . Up yonder hidden eyes watched in the shadows and death lay in wait . Up yonder there was no water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very ledges of rock took shape in the night , rising like battlements before him , inanimate and forbidding .  | VERY move of the crusaders was reported daily to Saladin by his spies and scouts . He knew that they were assembling at Beth Nable to besiege Jerusalem , and he felt suspense growing among his own men , wearied as they were by the ordeal of Acre and the rout at Arsuf . Without respite he directed the work of preparation for the decisive conflict . In the saddle before sun-up , he watched his masons raising the walls ; he divided the circuit of the walls among his amirs , while gangs of laborers hauled up stones for the engines . At times he even dismounted to go among them and carry stones himself . Every one knows Baha ad Din relates that in the land around Jerusalem it is useless to dig wells to find drinking water , the ground being nothing but a mountain of very hard rock . The sultan was careful to cut off all the waters found around the Holy City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cisterns , and to break down the wells . There remained not a drop of water fit to drink outside the walls . He also sent the order into all the provinces to hasten troops toward him .  | On the Wednesday after the loss of the caravan the old Kurd called his amirs into council to announce to them his plan for the defense of Jerusalem . They thronged into his pavilion and seated themselves about the carpet , whispering together . Many faces were missing from the circle . Al Adil , the shrewd and resourceful , had been sent to quell a revolt beyond the Euphrates , and Taki ad Din , who had been the sword-arm of the sultan , had been laid in his grave on the eastern frontier ? when Saladin had held in his hand the letter announcing his death , he had sent away all the attend from the tent , and had wept , fingering the broken seals of the missive . But El Meshtub , commander of the Kurds , was back again , ransomed . At his coming ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender ? the sultan instead of reproaching him had risen from his seat to take him in his arms , saying that he had endured more than any of them at Acre . Meshtub was seated again with the newcomers ? Aboul Heidja the Fat , who could barely move once he was down on his heels , and the lean Turkomans from the east . Asad ad Din , the veteran , was there , and Baha ad Din , who from his master 's side scanned the ring of faces intently . Saladin , leaning toward the kadi , bade him speak for a little on the war . And while the learned man was talking , Saladin mustered his thoughts , knowing well that these chieftains were balancing between zeal for his cause and dread . For they feared that a siege of Jerusalem would be a second Acre , and they longed to keep to the open country . What followed is told by Baha ad Din . The sultan remained silent some time in the attitude of a man who reflects and we respected his silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods , but their inner feelings were very different . They said to a man that the presence of the sultan in Jerusalem would be no advantage , and might be a peril for Islam ? that they would hold Jerusalem themselves while he kept the outer country as at Acre , to surround the Franks . Then he spoke . " The praise to God . To-day you are the only army of Islam . Only you are capable of confronting adversaries such as we have now before us . If you withdraw ? may it not please God ? the  | enemy will roll up the country as you would roll up a leaf of parchment . On you alone depends the safety of the Moslems , everywhere . I have spoken . " El Meshtub then took the word . " By God , I swear that while I live , I will not cease to aid thee ! " Others answered likewise , and this cheered the spirit of the sultan . He had the customary supper served and after that every one retired . Thursday ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended again upon our prince , and watched with him a part of the night , but he was not at all communicative . We made the last prayer , which was also the signal for all of us to retire . I was going out with the others when he recalled me . So I sat clown again at his side , and he asked me if I had heard the latest news . I answered , no . " To-day I have had a communication , " he said , " from Aboul Heidja . The amirs and mamluks held a gathering in his quarters , and blamed us for wishing to shut ourselves up in the city . They said that every one would undergo the fate of Acre , while all the outer country would fall to our enemies . They think it would be better to risk a ranged battle ; then , if God gave us victory , we would be the masters ; if defeated , we would lose Jerusalem , but the army would be saved . " The letter also contained this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , stay with us or else leave a member of your family ? for the Kurds would never obey the Turks , and otherwise the Turks would no longer obey the Kurds . " Knowing by this that they did not intend to remain in the city , the sultan had a grieving at his heart . He had for Jerusalem an attachment that can hardly be conceived , and this message caused him pain . I spent that night with him . It was the eve of Friday in the dry season , and no person other than God made a third with us . We decided to place in the city his great-nephew , son of Ferrukh Shah and lord of Baalbek . At first he thought of shutting himself up in the Holy City . We watched and prayed together . At daybreak he was still awake , and I begged him to take an hour 's rest . I went out to my quarters but had no sooner arrived than I heard the muezzin call to prayer , and for a while I made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break . As I sometimes made the morning prayer with the sultan , I went back to him and found him finishing his ablutions .  | " I have not slept a single moment , " he said to me . " I know that . " " How could you know it ? " " Because I have not slept myself ? there was not time . " After making the prayer together , I said to him : " An idea has come to me . May I submit it to you ? " He replied , " Speak ! " " 0 my lord , thou art overwhelmed with cares . To-day is Friday , in which all prayer is three-fold effective , and here we are , in a most suitable spot . Let the sultan make the ablutions , with bowings prostrations , and confide the keys of his problem to the hand de Lord . " For the sultan believed sincerely in all the tenets of the Faith , and submitted himself without misgiving to the divine wisdom . I left him then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prayer beside him in the mosque of Al Aksa , and I saw him make two bowings and prostrate himself , murmuring in a low voice . I saw the tears drip upon his grizzled beard and fall to the prayer rug . In the evening of the same day I resumed my usual attendance upon him , and at that time a dispatch arrived from Djordic who commanded the advance guard confronting the Franks . We read these words : " All the army of the enemy has just drawn up , mounted , on the crest of the hill and then retired to its camp . We have just sent spies to find out what is happening . " Saturday morning another dispatch came in , reading as follows : " Our spy has just come back and tells us that a dispute divides the enemy , some wishing to push on to the Holy City and others intending to return to their own territory . The French insist on marching upon Jerusalem . We have left our own land , ' they said , to regain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' " To that the king of England replied , From this point on , all the springs have been destroyed , so there is no water left near the city . Where , then , can we water our horses ? ' " Some one pointed out that they could have water at Tekou'a , a stream which runs about a parasang from Jerusalem . " ' Flow , ' said the king , could we water our beasts there ? ' " ' We will divide the army , ' they replied , into two bodies , one of which will mount and ride off to the watering place while the other remains near the city to carry on the siege , and every one will go once a day to Tekou'a. '  | " When one part of the army goes to drink with its animals , the garrison of the city will sally out and attack the others who remain , ' the king answered , and that will end it . ' ' " They decided finally to choose among the best-known men three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dozen individuals who would then choose three to decide the question . And they spent the night waiting for the decision of the three . " On the next morning we received another message . The Franks had broken camp and were on their way back to Ramlah . Saladin had triumphed and Richard had failed , without giving battle . And the reason for this was that the Lion Heart , the mightiest man of them all in single combat , became helpless when he took command of the army . ' Ambrose gives this account of Richard 's decision to turn back : " The French urged him many times to lay siege to the Holy City . The king said , We are far from the sea , and the Saracens would come down to cut of our supplies . Then the circuit of the city is so great that so many men would be needed . . . that we could not keep the host from being attacked by the Turks . And if 1 should lead the host , and if I should besiege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , I should be for ever blamed and dishonored . It is not to be done . " Richard then left the decision to the men selected by the council , who seem to have been Templars and Hospitalers for the most part . Another chronicler , De Vinsouf , says that if they decided to go on , Richard offered to go with them not as leader but as a soldier in the ranks . As to the final verdict , Ambrose says : " Those who had sworn and determined not to go on explained their reason  - -  that no water could be found for beasts or men , without great labor and danger . It would be the season of great heat , and no water could be found without going two leagues into a district filled with enemies . "  | THE pliant steel of Saladin 's patience had broken the iron courage of the crusaders . As iron snaps asunder , the army broke up into fragments once it had turned its back upon the hills of Jerusalem . Angered past reconciliation , the French went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed down to Jaffa , while the Italian soldiery hastened to their citadels of trade along the coast , and only the Templars and Hospitalers remained to guard the new wall of Ascalon . Richard went at once to Acre , as a man hurries from a long ordeal . His thoughts ht. kept to himself . Beyond doubt , he was impatient to embark for England where he was sorely needed , and had only lingered this long because the crusaders had insisted on marching to Jerusalem . So long as they turned their faces toward the Holy City , the pride of the Lion Heart would not let him forsake them . Now , with failure accepted , his hands were free . As a boy casts aside a once-cherished toy for a new plaything , he started toward the sea . Not before he had , done two mad  | things . In solemn conference he approved a plan to march against Cairo , after his departure , promising the aid of some three thousand English and Normans ? although even the minstrel Ambrose saw the hopelessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envoys to find Al Adil and bid the sultan 's brother make terms for the crusaders . Still , he clung to the hope of fair terms , saying that he would not relinquish half-ruined Ascalon . And on his way to embark ? after joining the queens at Acre  --  he ordered his own followers to make ready to take ship for Beirut to win this fertile northern port for the crusaders . He paid no heed to the gibes of the French , or to the song they sang in the taverns . For they made up a song about a coward and a king that stung the pride of the red-haired warrior . So matters were , when Saladin seized his opportunity . He roused his amirs , shook from them the inertia of the year 's defensive caution , and launched his horsemen straight down from Jerusalem to Jaffa . They came like a sword thrust out of the night , twenty thousand mounted men with siege engines on camel and mule back , and an exulting mass of Arabs clinging to their flanks . They drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pound with rocks and iron javelins at the gate of the wall toward Jerusalem . Some five thousand Christian men-at-arms were penned within the wall and in the tumult they manned their defenses sturdily , while a ship sped to Richard at Acre with tidings of the attack . The first rush of the Moslems was beaten back , and the sharp check cooled the spirits of the Turkomans who had no sympathy with sieges . It needed all Saladin 's urging to drive them to the assault , and for three days the Sultan 's mangonels gnawed at the gate until it was broken down and a breach of two lance lengths opened in the wall beside it . Then the Moslems scented victory , and flung themselves at the gap under a storm of arrows , their long scimitars swinging and crashing into the close ranks of the crusaders . Climbing over bodies and broken stones , the exultant mamluks forced the breach and drove the Christians through the  | streets , up the slope to the little citadel on a rocky height above the sand of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs nearly maddened by the rich plunder around them in dwellings and shops . Beating in the door of a monastery , the Moslems fell to hacking the bodies of the monks , killing them slowly to enjoy their torture . A church was ransacked and burned , and smoke poured up from the alleys where the looters snatched and screamed . They were beyond all control of their officers . Finding at . casks in the houses , they beat in the heads of the casks and let the wine run underfoot ; they forced captive women and children to drive the herds of swine together in one place and then left the bodies of the Christians strewn among the carcases of the abominated swine . Some of the fugitives climbed into boats drawn up on the gray sand of the shore , while others struggled to launch the boats . Alberic of Rheims , the commander of Jaffa , tried to escape in one of these vessels , but his knights pulled him back and led him up to a tower of the citadel . Few survived here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hazardous because the wall of the citadel had not been entirely rebuilt before the Moslem attack . Alberic of Rheims saw no hope for them . " We can do nothing here except give up our lives , " he said . The patriarch , a gigantic man who had escaped the contagion of fear , had sterner stuff in him . He rallied the people , reminding them that a ship had been sent to Acre for aid three days ago . If the assistance did not come , they could beg Saladin for terms . Saladin tried to restore order among his looters , and to launch a fresh attack on the gray stone wall of the citadel . The soldiers would not obey him Baha ad Din explains although he did not cease urging them until a late hour of the night . Then , perceiving that they were harassed by heat and fighting and smoke to the point of stupor , he mounted his horse and returned to his tent which was pitched near the baggage trains . There the officers who were on duty rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tent . But it was impossible to sleep ? I was so troubled by misgiving .  | At daybreak we heard trumpets sound among the Franks , and we thought that aid had come for them . The sultan sent for me , and said : " Reinforcements must have come for them by sea . But enough Moslem troops are on the shore to keep any one from debarking . Here is what must be done . Go and find the Malik el Dahir , ' and tell him to place himself outside the southern gate . You will enter the citadel with some men of your choice , and induce the Franks to pass out . You will take possession of all valuables and arms you find there . " I went off at once , taking Shams ad Din with me , and I found the Malik el Dahir on the hill near the sea with the advanced guard . He slept , in his coat of loose mail and mail hood , ready for combat . When I woke him , he got up at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the place where he was to await the sultan 's orders . There he made me explain what I planned to do . With my men I then entered the town of Jaffa , and on reaching the citadel we called to the Franks to come out . ' They replied that they would do so and began making preparations . Just as they started out Aziz ad Din remarked that they must not be allowed out until we had removed the Moslem soldiers from the town , or they would be pillaged . Djordic then tried to drive back our men by great blows of his baton ; but as they were no longer under the control of their officers or in ranks he found it impossible to make them go out . He kept on struggling with the mob against my remonstrance until it was full daylight . Seeing how the time had passed , I said to him , " Reinforcements are drawing nearer to the Franks , and the only thing for us to do is to hasten the evacuation of the citadel . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to do what I asked . We went to the gate of the citadel nearest the spot where the Malik el Dahir waited . Here we managed to pass out forty-nine Franks with their horses and women , and sent them away ? But then those who remained in the citadel took it into their heads to resist us . By now the relieving fleet had drawn near and every one could  | count the ships , and the garrison prepared to resume fighting ? we saw them putting on mail and seizing their shields . Seeing matters take this turn , I descended from my knoll near the gate and went to warn Aziz ad Din who was posted below with some troops . A moment later I was out of the town and with the malik , who sent me to the sultan to inform him of what was happening . He ordered a trumpeter to blow the call to arms . The drums rolled the recall , and our soldiers hastened in from all parts of the country to join in the conflict . They closed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garrison finding that no aid coming from the ships believed death inevitable . King Richard was in command of the galleys that drifted beyond the swell of the Jaffa beach . The galley bearing word of the Moslem attack had reached the harbor of Acre in the evening , while he was in his tent making the last preparations for embarking with his followers for Beirut and then for Europe . The messengers had come before him without ceremony , crying that Jaffa was taken and a remnant of the Christians besieged in the citadel , and that all would be lost unless aid reached them at once . " As God lives , " Richard had answered , " I will go there ! " And go he did , in spite of obstacles ? for some of the army was already at Beirut , and the French refused point-blank to march again under his standard . The Templars and Hospitalers agreed to go to Jaffa by land , only to be held up on the way by a Moslem ambush . Richard boarded his galleys with the earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Andrew of Chavigny and the Priux knights . With some hundreds of men-at-arms and volunteers from among the Genoese and Pisan bowmen , he put to sea , only to be held back for two days by contrary winds off the Carmel headland . They reached the Jaffa beach in the night and waited to see what story the dawn would tell . When the mists cleared and the sun blazed above the distant hills they saw nothing to cheer them . The beach was filled with Arabs and Turks , who were obviously settled there . Above the line of the sand , smoke eddied from the low gray wall of the city , half a mile from them . In the palm  | groves near the wall stood Moslem pavilions . Only Moslem banners could be made out . No sign of any kind was visible on the fortress , on its low bluff over the sand . The galleys moved in closer . Richard , standing with his knights under the red awning of the stern , scanned the line of the shore , and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , " what shall we do ? go away , or land ? " To try to force their way ashore in the face of Saladin 's army seemed to them out of the question , and they said so . They believed that all the people of the castle had been killed . At this moment the survivors of the citadel were actually calling to them , but the sound of the voices was drowned by the pulse of the swell and the taunting cries of the Arabs ? " flllah akbar ? illah 1'allahu . " So Baha ad Din says . Then a black figure dropped from the wall of the citadel to the sand of the beach below . It fell but got up again and ran through the Moslems to the edge of the swell . Plunging into the water , it swam toward the nearest galley , which moved in and picked it up . The swimmer proved to be a priest of the garrison and he was taken at once to the long red galley over which the king 's banner floated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees before the king . " Beau Sire , the people who await you here are lost if you do not aid them . " " What ! " Richard demanded . " Are any living yonder ? Where are they ? " " Some of them live , shut in the towers . " Richard looked at his companions . " Messires ? damned be he who hangs back ! " He ordered his vessel to row in , while the half-naked seamen on the benches looked each at the other askance . The long oars rose and dipped , the red galley with the dragonhead prow slipped into the line of the swell and the others followed after . On the sideboards the English men-at-arms buckled tight their belts , thrusting their arms through the slips of the shields , and freed the swords in their sheaths.  | The red galley was the first to grate upon the sand . It lurched and rolled in the swell , while the Moslems yelled their hatred and the swarthy Italian shipmen crossed themselves and snatched up bows and axes . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason into the madness of this landfall . He jumped over the side , waist deep in the water . He still wore his ship slippers with no other armor than a mail shirt and a steel cap . On his shoulder he gripped a crossbow and his long sword hung at his side . Wading through the swell , he began to shoot bolts at the ' ' ' Moslems , with Peter of Priux and another knight beside him . When they came out of the water they drew their swords , lashing about them under the arrows that the shipmen plied from the prow . Recognizing the king , the Moslems in front of him gave back hastily , while the English hastened forward to form a shield ring about him . Other galleys were running up on the beach , the crews casting beams and benches ashore . Men caught these up and carried them forward , lugging the small skiffs and riff-raff of the beach into a barricade of sorts . But Richard was not within the barricade . Taking a shield from a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall and a stair that he remembered led to the Templars ' house . With his knights clattering after him he leaped up the stair and the Arab looters of the alleys yelled in amazement at sight of the dripping figure that strode among them . Richard cleared the alleys and pounded at a gate of the citadel until the garrison became aware of him . By then his galleys held the beach , and his men were streaming up the Templars ' stair . his banner went up , on the tower of the citadel . The knights of the garrison took new heart at his coming ; they sallied forth and began to drive the disorganized Moslems toward the gates of the outer town . Then 13aha ad Din relates charging in a mass on our men , they drove them out of the town . The gate was so clogged by the fleeing that many lost their lives . A throng of pillagers who followed the army had lingered in some churches , occupied with deeds that  | should not be mentioned . The Franks forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This all happened under my eyes in less than an hour . As I was mounted , I set off at a gallop to advise the sultan whom I found with the two envoys ' before him , and holding in his hand the pen with which he was about to write the letter of grace . I whispered to him what had happened , and , without commencing to write , he began to talk to them to distract their attention . Some seconds later Moslems came up , fleeing before the enemy . Seeing them , he cried out to his men to seize the envoys , and to mount their horses . Richard 's quick action had wrought something like a miracle . On his heels the men from the galleys had been able to break into the waterfront of Jaffa before the disciplined portions of Saladin 's troops could come up to oppose them ; the rout of the Moslems in the streets had thoroughly disorganized the army outside , forcing Saladin to draw back in haste to the nearest hills to take stock of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could with the three horses they managed to pick up in the town . The bolts of the crossbows followed the Moslems for two miles , and that night Richard pitched his tent where Saladin 's pavilion had been . Word of the arrival of Malik Ric spread over the countryside , and when quiet had fallen around Jaffa in the evening , some of the old mamluks and chieftains like Dolderim went back to the Christian lines out of curiosity to see this king who had dared land in the face of an army . They came in peace , and were taken to the royal tent , where Richard cried them a welcome . They found him still in his mail shirt , seated on his pallet amid a mass of arms and gear . Around the great tallow candles stood the tall figures of his knights . Wine goblets had been emptied and filled again many times , while the ruddy warrior king laughed at the happenings of the day . Nothing could have pleased him more than the appearance  | of the dark Moslem lords in armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by name . " Why did the sultan leave at my coming ? " he demanded . " By God , I did not come armed for serious fighting . Look , I still have on no shoes but ship sandals . " Again he exclaimed , " By the great God , I did not think he could take Jaffa in two months , and here he carried it in two days ! " After thinking a moment , he gave them a message fore Saladin . " Tell him I have no wish to be a Pharaoh over this land . Will he sacrifice all the Moslems to keep me out ? I renounce the claims I made to Al Adil . Let the sultan grant me but one church , and I will return him the like . " To this upon the next day Saladin made grave response . " The king has made himself master of all these cities , yet he knows well that if he goes away they will fall into our power . If it seems a simple matter for him to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it not more easy for me ? " I have around me my family and my children . Moreover , I am now an old man , no longer having a taste for the pleasures of the world . I have renounced all such . As for my troops , the men I have round me in the winter are replaced by others in the summer . In the end , I believe that my actions will be accounted as true devotion . And I shall not cease to hold to this line of conduct until God grants the victory to him to whom He is pleased to grant it . " Behind thesewords might be perceived a hope that Richard would leave the coast , and a dread that he would stay . Saladin 's will to hold out was steadfast as ever , but he was laboring with the disorganization among his men . Under no other circumstances , perhaps , would he have agreed to the plan to seize Richard that his men were now forming . In the interval arrived Henry of Champagne with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest were checked by the Moslems holding the shore . Richard had now at Jaffa some fifty-five knights with several hundred men-at-arms and two thousand-odd bowmen , Genoese and Pisans among them . But he had no more  | than fifteen horses . With this semblance of an army he lay outside Jaffa facing the Moslems . He had landed on Saturday . It was Tuesday night that a detachment of Turks from Aleppo and one of the Kurdish clans started forth to penetrate his camp and carry him off .  | DARKNESS covered the earth , blurring the outlines of the squat fig trees and the shaggy palms against the sky where the stars were fading . Dogs barked from time to time in the distance . Along the beach behind the camp the swell sighed gently . Beside the tents a church tower loomed . Among the tents men sprawled on cloaks , breathing heavily . There were no camp fires , and the young moon had slipped out of sight long since . Sentries who had paced the hard ground idly in the earlier hours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen of the trees where the water bags dripped , and tried not to snore . A young Genoese got up from the ground , yawned and spat . Stepping over the huddled bodies around him , he walked between the tents , lifting his feet drowsily over the cords that had been tightened by the dampness of the night . He walked out into a trampled field in which tufted artichokes had been growing not long since . He squatted down , blinking indifferently at the sky , now turning gray . Somewhere horses moved with a shuffling sound , and he heard the mutter of men 's voices . But there were no horses afoot in the  | camp . Down in the murk toward the hills dull gleams appeared and vanished , and he watched them . Then he heard a faint clinking of metal , and a cold chill passed over his skin . The dim flashing yonder under the lightening sky came from polished helmets , and men and horses were moving toward the camp . The Genoese ran back toward the tents , shouting : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the nearest sleepers roused . The Genoese ran on , stumbling over the ropes , and tall figures came from the tents to question him . An order was given and a horn blared . Knights ran up , pulling mail coifs over their heads and knotting sword girdles about their hips . Some of them had not stopped to don breeches or hose , and their legs shone white in the murk . King Richard appeared among them in full mail , his Danish ax swinging in his hand . A horse was led up and he mounted hastily . The quiet earl of Leicester and his companions followed his example without ado ? there were only ten horses , and in the darkness a man took what he found . Even these makeshift chargers , sorry nags some of them ? which did not know a lance from a cart pole  --  were better than no horses . The sky lightened in the east , with the first yellow of sunrise . Men said that Moslems were advancing in squadrons , slowly . Either they had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge until they could see something . Beyond the church , on the other side of the town , the horns of the Genoese and Pisans sounded . Richard had Normans and English with him . Under his sharp commands they ranged themselves in a half circle spreading from the church to the shore . The men of the outer rank went down on their right knees , holding their shields slanting from the ground in their left hands . Their right hands held their lances , the butts wedged into the ground , the iron heads pointing outward . Between every pair of lances a crossbowman took his place , with another standing behind him to load an extra piece and pass it forward to him . Along their rank rode King Richard , outlined against the red dawn , and they heard his deep voice .  | " Stand fast , valiant men . . . . Do not give ground , for the enemy are round us , and to flee is to die . " His voice went away , and the Moslems charged with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard ground . They came direct for the red banner of the lion , and the crossbows whirred in their faces . The horses crashed into the spears , and the clatter of swords was heard . The charge did not break the sturdy spearmen , and the Moslems wheeled off . Other waves charged , but under the sting of the iron bolts , they turned and galloped along the front , plying their bows . Richard had not the patience to endure this for long . He led out his ten horsemen against the clans , with spears down . The heavier knights beat a way through the Kurds , and Richard found himself beyond them . Looking around , he saw the earl of Leicester on foot , fighting with his sword . Richard galloped over to him , and covered him until he could mount a riderless horse . The melee grew thick about them , and some Turks overthrew and disarmed the knight of Mauleon . They were carrying him off a prisoner , when the king saw them and charged them , lashing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and among his own men . The Moslems drew off , and the sun flooded the plain with light . For a while there was a pause while the two sides ranged themselves anew . And in this quiet , an unarmed Turk rode up , holding high his right arm and gripping in his left the reins of two fine horses ready saddled . He was allowed into the lines and led to the knights , to whom he explained that the horses were a gift from Al Adil to the English king . The sultan 's brother had seen that Richard was poorly mounted . " Sire , " his knights cried , " do not ride either of them . There is evil in this and they will bear you off to the Moslems . " For answer Richard swung himself into the saddle of one of the chargers . " I f Satan sent me a good horse this day , " he said , " I would ride him . " And he ordered a purse to be given to the messenger .  | By mid-morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mounted bowmen drove at them , first at one place , then at another . The men-at-arms stood their ground , but the galley men drifted back to the ships , away from the missiles . Some of the Genoese ran into the town , and behind them the Moslem horse penetrated the gaps in the city wall . When Richard heard of this he rode back , into Jaffa , taking with him two knights and a couple of archers . He dared not withdraw more men from the thin line of the Normans and English . Trotting through the narrow streets among the fugitives , he came full upon three Turks who had bright caparisoning on their horses . He dug his spurs into the Arab charger , and struck down one of the Moslems with his sword , knocking a second man from the saddle . The third fled and the archers caught the two horses . Seeing the king , some seamen trailed after him , and Richard fairly cleared the streets with a growing queue of retainers behind him . This done , he seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending his new followers into the galleys to rout out the malingerers . When the ships were cleared he upbraided the throng , telling off five men to guard each vessel . With the rest he went back into the city , mustering wounded and unarmed men to pile stones within the breaches of the crumbling wall . Then he led the fugitives out to the fighting line . Here he dared not rest . The Moslems were still attacking . With his dozen horsemen , Richard sallied out and broke up a charge . Still , he pressed on , his great sword swinging over his head . He left his companions and went forward , disappearing among the Moslems . Some Turks closed around him and he beat them off . A single officer charged him at a gallop , bending low in the saddle , his round shield raised and his scimitar swinging . As he came , he mocked those who hung back before the king . " Make way , " he shouted , " 0 dogs ? make way for a man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stirrups to strike once with his sword . The long blade split the light shield , and bit through the man 's throat , turning against the bones of his chest . With the head , the Moslem 's  | shoulder and arm flew off and his body dropped lifeless to the ground . Shouting their dismay , the others drew back before the iron rider who could not be overthrown . They shot arrows at him , and launched javelins as he passed among them , but one man among so many is no easy mark . From the whirling horses and the dust clouds Richard emerged again into the view of his men , with javelins sticking in his mail and the leather caparisoning of his horse pierced with arrows . No longer did the Moslems attack with spirit . Richard seemed to them invulnerable , and to go against his sword was surely death . They could not break the line of the Christians again , and when Saladin gave the order for another onset , his riders sat their horses motionless and sullen . Snatching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes were elsewhere . From the line of spearmen Richard had appeared anew . Into the cleared ground between Christian and Moslem he trotted , lance uplifted , and from left to right he rode slowly down the Moslem front , and no man dared go out against him . When Saladin cried to them again to charge , only the malik his son responded . When the old sultan motioned him back , some of the amirs laughed , and the brother of Meshtub shouted , " Make your young officers charge ! Call them forth , who struck us the day of the taking of Jaffa , and stole the loot from our men ! " Saladin looked about him and gave the order to retire , riding off with his mamluks to his own tent . Richard had saved Jaffa . But in the next days , overwearied , he fell ill with many of his people . In the heat and stench of the town that was little better than a shambles , men died swiftly , and the king did not get back his strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered Count Henry and the masters of the Temple and Hospital to his couch . They came with grave faces . At Jerusalem , Saladin had found new reinforcements , trained mamluks from Egypt . The malcontents had been sent away , the army whipped  | into shape for a new blow against the weakening crusaders . The French had moved south , but were camped at Caesarea , determined not to fight under Richard 's banner . The whole line of the coast was open to attack , with no more than a hundred knights to be relied upon to obey Richard . The king , wasted by the fever , knew that he could not take the saddle again for weeks . " Bid Al Adil from me , " he said , " to make what terms he can for us . Anything , but the surrender of Ascalon . " He had struck his last blow in the Holy Land . Humphrey of Toron and the veteran lords of the land went to Saladin 's camp , and there agreed upon the terms of peace with Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that his troops were weary of the war and that no gain could come by fighting on . " I fear to make peace , " he said to Baha ad I ) in , " for I know not what will happen if I die . " The terms were simple ? each side keeping , in effect , what it held at the time . The Christians became acknowledged masters of the coast , from Tyre to Jaffa , including of course Acre . This meant that they kept also the neighboring villages in the plain midway to the foothills . Ramlah on the pilgrim road from Jaffa to Jerusalem was to be held mutually , and no taxes were to be placed on merchandise going and coming across the new frontier ? in this clause , and in the long dispute over Ascalon , the hand of the Italian merchants is to be seen . Christian pilgrims were to be free to journey up to Jerusalem without paying tribute , under the protection of the sultan . Richard had to yield Ascalon ? at least the fortifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place left open , without being held by either side for three years . And a truce was agreed upon for three years from the coming Easter , which meant more nearly four years . Al Adil rode down with the chieftains of the crusaders , to hear the Christians take the oath at Acre . It was Wednesday , the second of September , in this year 1192 , that Count Henry , Humphrey of Toron , Balian of Ibelin , and the masters of the military orders gathered in the small stone-flagged  | room beside the sick chamber of the king . Under Al Adil 's eyes a written parchment lay upon the table where candles stood to give a better light than the dim embrasure . In their court surcoats the Christian lords who were now to be masters of this strip of coast came forward and signed the parchment or made their mark , and swore upon their faith to keep the new peace . Then the parchment was carried in to Richard , and a priest began to read over the written words . The sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand impatiently , bidding the reader cease . " I give my word and my faith , " he said , and turned his head away from them . He had sworn to them that when the truce ended he would return to the Holy Land with new forces , to renew the war . The next day Saladin swore to the peace before his amirs , asking only that Bohemund , prince of Antioch , and the count of Tripoli agree also to the terms ? which they hastened to do thereafter . On that day Moslem officers rode into the streets and market places of Jerusalem and announced that peace was made ? that Jerusalem was safe in the hands of Islam and that Moslems could go where they willed among the Christians . Drums beat by the gates and throngs sat in joyful talk . Venturesome souls wandered down into the Christian camps ; warriors from the East left their outposts and rode among the weary men-at-arms who had left Europe long months before . The men-at-arms were drinking wine , well content to hear that the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and already the Christian priests and barons were making ready to journey up to Jerusalem to visit the Sepulcher . Richard would not go . He would not go as a pilgrim to the Sepulcher that he had sworn to redeem with his sword . What were his thoughts as he lay on his pallet , harkening to the stir and bustle of his nobles making ready for the ride to Jerusalem ? Did he remember that his unbridled spirit had  | estranged the other leaders of the crusade , until , one after the other , they left him ? He should have healed the quarrels , not embittered them . And Jerusalem ? could he have taken the Holy City if he had pressed on that last summer ? Under his leadership the crusade had failed . No man could wield sword or lance so well as he , and surely he had not spared himself hurt or hazard in this venture . But when he ( took command of the armed host he became helpless ? even the success at Arsuf had not been his doing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced with the army ; and when , at long last , he stood at Beth Nable within a ride of the Holy City , he might have treated to advantage , instead of withdrawing . He had failed . And yet long would the Moslems remember Malik Ric , and never would minstrel or soldier forget how Richard had waded ashore at Jaffa in the face of an army ? or how thereafter almost single-handed he had held thousands at bay , from the rising to the setting of the sun . Almost he had won there with his sword the victory that he had forfeited by his feckless leadership . Almost .. . Heedless and arrogant , lovable and utterly brave , the Lion Heart lay on his pallet in Acre town , and thought of this not at all . He played with his hawks , or listened to a new lai of the minstrel Blondel ? impatient of Berengaria 's ministrations , eager only for the hour when he could put to sea and set his face toward a new venture . Such is the Richard revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legendary Richard , ever victorious , and not the Richard drawn by Scott , high-strung , dominant , yet always hampered by the jealousy and treachery of the princes his allies . And still the portrait is not complete , and the riddle of his actions remains to be explained . When Richard landed upon the coast of Acre , it is clear that he was assured and confident ? even to carelessness . He had so borne himself at Messina and Cyprus ; at Acre he chafed under delay , and he thrust aside the other commanders deliberately , estranging them or overruling them until he himself held sole command . He  | sent jesting messages to Saladin , and ordered the massacre of the Moslem captives who were actually hostages . Between that massacre , on August twentieth , and his first conference with Al Adil , on September fifth , his whole bearing changed . The careless and confident warrior became the cautious and moody king . Consider his actions during those two weeks . He is in unquestioned command at last , yet his march toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation in which he has placed his men ; at Arsuf he forbids irritably the Hospitalers to make a counter-charge ? yet when that charge begins involuntarily , he throws aside all restraint and gets to the head of it himself . But the next day he declines to resume the battle . Although he had hoped to march on at once to Ascalon , he delays at Jaffa , and delays again . He fortifies Jaffa and indulges in magnificent but useless knighterrantry while the months pass and he importunes the sultan almost petulantly for terms . When the army itself twice begins the march to Jerusalem , he is the first to insist upon a retreat . He fortifies Ascalon , and garrisons every little hill tower he can reach . No general was ever more eager to in trench himself and more reluctant to attack . His only hope of defeating Saladin and gaining Jerusalem lay in taking the offensive . And this he did not attempt . When the French nobles reminded him that the sole purpose of the crusade was an advance upon Jerusalem , Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He even insisted on them , in the last , bitter argument . Why ? What had changed the debonair Coeur de Lion into the timid general ? Not the disheartening tidings from England . Richard had already twice hazarded the fortunes of his new kingdom , to aid in the crusade ? once when he exhausted the resources of England to outfit his expedition , and again when he remained in Palestine after Philip sailed back to France ? and the urgent appeal to return to England did not reach him until April , - 192 . Modern historians , both French and English , have observed that Richard was unfit to hold high command . In-197 capacity alone , however , does not explain his actions . A foolish or ignorant commander may sacrifice his men , or throw away his army , but he does not intrench and safeguard his men and communications . Richard sacrificed the chance of victory for minor successes until the last . There an explanation of the riddle of Richard 's conduct . In justic to the memory of a gallant man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acre , the English king had been accustomed only to the feudal warfare of France , with its raid and siege carried on by the ill-disciplined and scanty feudal levies of the princes . The moment he set out from Acre to march to Jaffa at the head of a great army , Richard was confronted by the problems of the grande guerre the war of armies maneuvering over open and strange country , with the fate of the crusade hanging upon each battle . I t seems to the present writer that the English king realized then his unfitness to command in such a war . He could not relinquish the command . He had sought it deliberately at Acre ; his reputation and his exalted rank prevented him from yielding it to an inferior ; and there remained no man of princely rank to whom he could have surrendered it ? even Conrad , the ablest commander of the allies , having withdrawn in anger to " Pyre . He was helpless to accomplish anything , but he could not resign his leadership . Nor could he alter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hearts set on Jerusalem , blindly , at all hazards . So Richard became afraid , not of personal peril , but of disgrace and disaster . Unable to turn back , he must go on , knowing that his unfitness to command made every movement hazardous . The antipathy of Conrad , the growing insubordination of the French who realized his failing , and the bad news from England , all made his position more intolerable . And the blind devotion of the common soldiers who looked upon him as a matchless leader only added to his mental torment . The proof of this may lie in his own words , in answer to the French when the army was nearest Jerusalem , as given by the chronicler De Vinsouf : " You will not see me as leader ,  | when it would be folly to press on , and disgrace to me . If it please you to proceed to Jerusalem , I will accompany you as comrade , but not as commander . I will follow , but I will not lead you . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His brief letters home only mentioned events such as Arsuf , and he confided , apparently , in no one . Perhaps he never understood that he had ruined the chances of the crusade by his refusal to content himself with the leadership of the English contingent , and to cooperate with Philip and Conrad . But it is significant that , at the end , he would not visit Saladin and set foot within Jerusalem ? the two things that he had most longed for ? after his failure . What he decided to do , in his dilemma , is pitifully clear . He determined to avoid battle with Saladin and to safeguard the army at all costs , while he risked his own life in reckless efforts to gain some advantage with a handful of men . Always on such forays , he was in high spirits , while in the camp he became moody and uncertain . He shunned his headquarters deliberately , and kept himself as much as possible beyond the protection of his own lines . It may have been that , realizing his failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of the army fit in with his own knight-errantry . That was when Saladin came down on Jaffa . Richard 's response was instant , and his almost childish enthusiasm afterward was unmistakable . The riddle of Richard puzzled Al Adil and Baha ad Din at times , but Saladin understood the warrior-king . It was with a two-fold meaning that the sultan said , " If I should be fated to lose the Holy Land , I would rather lose it to Malik Ric than to any other . " He admired Richard 's courage , while he perceived his inability to command . But Saladin was not to relinquish the Holy Land . All the armed power of Christendom , with a sacrifice of nearly two hundred thousand men , had won back only a fragment of his conquests and not one of the holy places . Although he did not realize it , the truce that Saladin had dreaded was to be a safeguard for Islam , since his own days were numbered .  | ALMOST before the treaty had been signed the first of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of the hero Andrew of Chavigny . They put aside their weapons and armor , and went in a body hundreds strong ? an extraordinary risk , for the Moslems who had fought against them a few days before were still camped in the hills , and they had not yet received a safeconduct from Saladin . Ambrose relates what befell them : As they passed the plain of Ramlah in their journey , the barons talked together and decided that they would send to tell Saladin that they were coming to Jerusalem , with letters from the king of England , to visit the Sepulcher . Those who carried this message were wise and valiant men , but all their prowess was rendered futile by their negligence . They rode on horses across the plain of Ramlah , as far as the Tower of the Knights , where they halted to search for El Adil . The truth is , they went to asleep for so long that , long after they went on again they saw in front of them Sir Andrew and the pilgrims marching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messengers coming after them , they stopped bewildered . " Ah , Seigneur God , " cried the high men , " we are lost if the Saracens see us . Here are the ones who should have carried the message of our coming . If we go among them without warning them , they will attack us . " The messengers hastened on again , toward Jerusalem . They found more than two thousand Turks camped outside the city . After a long search they found El Adil and explained that our people were coming . El Adil reproached them bitterly , saying that it was an insane undertaking , and that they valued their lives little to march without a safe-conduct . Night fell as they spoke together , and the main body of Christians came up , without arms or plans . When the Saracens saw them , they confronted them with such menace that even the boldest would have liked well to be back at Acre then . They passed that night behind a wall . The next day the Saracens went before Saladin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims . But Saladin at once summoned his officers and told them that the Christians had his safe-conduct to go to the Sepulcher and make their pilgrimage . Ambrose himself went with the second throng , that met the first pilgrims coming out of the I loly City at dawn . By then Saladin 's guards were posted along the road , and the crusaders felt safe . We passed through the hills , and came to the joyous height , from which Jerusalem can be seen . Then our hearts were glad . We knelt as all those do ? and ought to do ? who come hither . We saw what we could ? above all the tomb in which was placed the body of the Lord after death . Some of us put offerings there , but the Saracens snatched them away . After that we only gave silver to the captives , men of Europe and the Syrian coast , who were in bondage there . We gave them our offerings and they said , " God requite you ! " We went to the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planted , there where the rock had cracked asunder . We came to this place , and we kissed it . From there we went to the church of Mount Sion , all ruined . Then we hastened to see the holy table where the Lord once seated Himself and ate , and we kissed it also , but we barely stayed there for the Saracens were seizing the pilgrims from our train and hiding them in caverns , three or four at a time ... .  | Then we went , much disturbed , to the grotto wherein was the Lord when he was taken . Filled with pity and yearning , we kissed this place and we shed hot tears ? for there were the stables and the horses of these servants of the devil who defiled the holy places and threatened the pilgrims . We left Jerusalem then , and returned to Acre . Saladin remained as generous in his hour of victory as he had been before the stress of the war . When Richard wrote to him requesting that the French ? who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to visit Jerusalem , the sultan replied that he could not withhold his permission from some of the crusaders after giving it to all . 1 lc bade the worthy bishop of Salisbury who led the third contingent of pilgrims ask a boon of him , and the bishop , after a night of thought , requested that two Latin priests be allowed to remain at the Sepulcher to perform Mass , morning and evening . When Richard announced that at the end of the truce he would return and wrest the land from the Moslems , the sultan responded gravely that if he must lose the I loly Land he would rather lose it to Richard than to any other man . The English king had been convalescing at llaifa while the survivors of the crusade took ship for the long voyage through the autumn storms . Here he was joined by his queen Berengaria who nursed him in his pavilion within the shadow of Carmel by the gardens of Elijah 's tomb . She was to have only this one month of quiet with the Lion I leart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crusade , and for a moment at the wedding in Cyprus she had come before the eyes of the world . Thereafter , she is no more than a name heard of from place to place in the footsteps of her stormy warrior . Richard would not take her with him , and she sailed from Acre to the shelter of the papal court in Rome , where she lingered on learning that Richard had been made captive . For a while then she rested at the Plantagenet court , with Queen Eleanor at Poitiers , but Richard did not seek her there . A story is told that he sent for her on his death bed ,  | but it is only a story , and the name of Berengaria was heard no more after his end . She did not go back to her father 's court of Navarre , nor would the Plantagenets give her aid or countenance . It is known now that she lived in obscurity for years in a town within the hills of Anjou , her only visitor a passing cardinal . Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small escort . His homefaring was no simple matter , for by now his brother John was settled in England , his own partisans scattered , and nearly every reigning prince of Europe his enemy . When he boarded the galley , he went to his cabin at once , and the sail was hoisted . Not until the next dawn , when the Syrian coast lay beyond sight , did he appear on deck . How , untroubled by the dangers ahead of him , he turned into the Adriatic , to try to pass through the German lands in disguise , and how he was recognized by his royal bearing , sought by the man he had offended at the siege of Acre ? Leopold of Austria ? and held for ransom by the emperor , is a tale that has been told often . Saladin waited on the coast until it was known beyond doubt that the English king had sailed . Then , in the Haram of Jerusalem , he dismissed his officers and turned his thoughts to the needs of peace . For three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would have liked to go back to Cairo , that he had not seen for ten years , but he was troubled by lassitude and by the fasting which he now undertook to make up for the Ramadan fasts that he had been obliged to omit during the campaigning . When the rains began , he went to the court at Damascus , hunting a little and listening to the talk of learned men . Thither he summoned his faithful kadi toward the end of February . Baha ad Din found that the sultan had secluded himself and would see no visitors , although many waited in the anterooms of the palace . When the kadi , however , was announced , Saladin ordered him admitted and greeted him with genuine pleasure , sitting in the garden beneath the bare poplars . A tray of fruit and sweetmeats was brought out to them , and Saladin only tasted the food , while he spoke of his greatest  | wish ? to make the pilgrimage to Mecca in the coming spring . The autumn pilgrims from the south , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to Damascus . The next day Baha ad Din relates he sent for me , and I found him seated on a bench in the garden , having around him the youngest of his children . He demanded if any people were waiting to see him , and , hearing that envoys of the Franks were there as well as the amirs and higher officers of the state , he gave orders to admit the ambassadors to him . One of his young children , the amir Abou Bakr ? of whom he was very fond and with whom he was accustomed to make sport ? began to weep at seeing these men who had shaven cheeks and strange garments . Then the sultan excused himself to them , and dismissed them without hearing what they had to say . In these last days he had given up his receptions , explaining that it troubled him to move about . Indeed he suffered from weariness and another thing . Many fasts had remained for him to undergo , since he had not observed them during his frequent illnesses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up the omitted fasts , and this injured his health . His physician blamed hint much for doing as he did . The sultan would not listen , saying , " No one may know what will come to pass . " So he had continued to fast until he had made up all that was lacking . He asked if I had news of the pilgrim caravan . " I met some of the travelers on the way hither , " I answered . " If it had not been for the mud , they would have arrived to-day . But to-morrow they will enter the city . " He then said that he would go to meet them , and gave order to mend the road and drain away the water ? for the season was still rainy . After that I withdrew , noticing that he lacked his usual vivacity . Friday morning he went out , mounted . Leaving the servants , I hastened to join him , and just at that moment he met the caravan . In it were Sabah ad Din and Karadja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his habit with the older men . It was a magnificent sight this day , the inhabitants of the city coming out in a mass to meet the caravan and see the sultan . I noticed for the first time that the sultan had not his quilted khalat , without which he never went forth on a horse . When I asked about it , he had the aspect of waking from a dream , and demanded the  | garment , but no one could find the master of the wardrobe . It seemed strange that the sultan should be asking in vain for the khalat that he was never without . I asked if there was no way of returning to the city without passing through the multitudes . He said yes , and took a by-path that led through the gardens . We followed after him , but I felt oppressed fearing for his health . Coining to the citadel , he entered , crossing the drawbridge as usual . It was the last time that he went out mounted . That evening the sultan was troubled by extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of fever . Twelve days later , on the third of March , 1193 , died the Malik en Nasr Salah ad Din . Although Baha ad Din and the sultan 's companions had expected it , they left the palace that day in profound grief . Damascus mourned , the shutters drawn over the shops , and the bazaars deserted . Beside the body of the man who had led them for twenty years with unfaltering patience , the old imams read from the leaves of the Koran . When Saladin 's son took the sultan 's place at the head of the carpet for the noon meal , the companions of the dead sultan felt the stab of grief anew . When they called upon the treasury for money to pay the expenses of the simple funeral , they found almost ' tithing in the palace . He who had possessed so much Baha ad Din explains and such great riches , he did not leave in dying more than forty-seven dirhems and a single piece of Syrian gold . He left neither goods , nor house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other kind of property . Saladin had sacrificed years of his life to keep the field against the crusaders , and his spirit had been as simple and fervent as that of any Christian crusader . He had kept inviolate his ideal of personal honor ? more exacting than the Christian code of chivalry . He was a Kurd , ruling over Turks and Arabs for the most part ; the glorious first days of victory were followed by the hard years of conflict with the crusaders from overseas , and the Moslems had grown weary of the  | long war . ' Saladin 's last months - even when embassies came from Constantinople and the Caucasus to felicitate him ? were disturbed by revolt in the east . It was the irony of his life that , at heart a scholar and a lover of peace , he had to be at war without respite . They buried his body in the garden tomb , beside the north wall of the great mosque in Damascus , where the school children patter by on their way to the teachers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above that courtyard , on the lintel of the sealed door , still stood the inscription of forgotten years : " Thy kingdom , 0 Christ , is everlasting . " Neither Saladin 's ability nor his zeal for the holy war descended to his three sons . They inherited variously Cairo , Damascus , and Aleppo and soon became engaged in differences with each other . As Saladin foresaw , his army was never assembled again and when the thre eyears ' truce drew near its end the prince of Damascus was well content to renew it , while the crusaders on the edge of the Syrian coast were too weak to make any new effort toward Jerusalem . The Ayoubites ? as Saladin 's successors came to he called allowed trade to take its natural course with the coast ports , and occupied themselves with fortifying their three citadels - Cairo , Damascus , and Aleppo . They were tolerant and cultured men , little inclined toward war , and it became profitable to them to allow the Italian ships to put in to the ports without let or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Adil , a powerful influence in Saladin 's day , physically strong and energetic ? he could finish off a whole lamb at a sitting , and was at fiftythree still a great lover of women ? began to gather into his capable hands the reins that death had taken from his brother .  | With large possessions of his own in the east , he waited until actual conflict broke out between the new prince of Cairo and the new sultan of Damascus . Whereupon he threw his influence upon the side of Al Aziz , the stronger , in Cairo , and became himself governor of Damascus . It was only natural , then , that he should be appointed atabeg or war lord of the two kingdoms when Al Aziz died , leaving an incapable son on the throne of Egypt . Arabs , Turks , and Kurds alike remembered the old patriarchal rule of the clans , by which the eldest able-bodied kinsman became chief of the clan . Thousands of Saladin 's mamluks had kept together even while serving in the various armies . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they favored Al Adil more than any grandson . " Is it not disgraceful , " said the Malik Al Adil , " for me , an old man , to be the atabeg of a child ? I should have succeeded my brother the Malik an Nasr Salah ad Din . I gave up this hope out of respect for my brother 's memory . " The words of the shrewd Kurd struck a responsive chord in the veterans of the army , and Al Adil was acclaimed sultan of Egypt . He had , of course , his old provinces to the east of the Jordan , and the Damascus country . Swiftly he extended his authority over much of Arabia and Jerusalem and southern Syria ? so that he held together the nucleus of Saladin 's small empire in the year ; t 198 . The northern regions had broken up among minor chieftains . When the crusaders advanced again , they found a shrewd and extremely capable sultan in command of the Moslem forces . Two years before there had been discord among the Moslems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | IT Is necessary now to look behind the scenes . The men who have played their parts upon the battlefield are engaged elsewhere , even Al Adil . They have returned , it might be said , to their homes ; they have put aside the crusader 's cross and have donned mufti , but they have not laid aside their swords . Again , they play the natural roles of life , and what they are doing is most important . In these years from 1195 to 1199 the curtain is drawn upon the theater of the war while there is truce in the I holy Land . Yet in these years vital changes took place in the aspect of the crusades . Old roles were cast aside  --  some of them torn up ? and new parts studied . Fresh ideas replaced old , and the stage itself was enlarged . We must look at Europe as a whole where the actors are at home . The heavy losses of the years 1189 to 1192 did not dishearten the men of the cross . After all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sepulcher . They had stern stuff in them , and it seemed to them that another effort would redeem the holy places . Besides , a new generation was growing up , ready to take arms .  | Jerusalem , in their eyes , was the road of salvation . Defeat , the priests told them , had been caused by their own sins . A greater sacrifice , a more fervent attempt , rightly led , and the Seigneur God would bless them by the restoration of His city . The visible , actual Jerusalem was still the invisible Eternal City through which they entered upon salvation . No doubt about that . It was as certain as the water of baptism , or the wine of the sacrament . Those who failed to redeem Jerusalem lay under the anger of the Lord . The capture of Jerusalem would be a sign of the forgiveness of the Lord . The masses of Christendom yearned for this sign of victory . Preachers exhorted them , as once Peter the Hermit had done , and they took the cross anew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed in the new cathedrals for the restoration of Jerusalem . The ribald and masterless serfs no longer appeared in the groups of crusaders ; there was no place for them . In the hundred years since the first crusade , things had changed . Undisciplined masses no longer hastened upon the via Dei . The resistless torrent of the first days had become a strongly flowing river guided into fresh channels . The first crusaders had spoken of their comrades as the soldiers of Christ . The popes , however , who had led the preparation for the crusades , called them soldiers of the Church . But by now ? unmist- . ably during the campaign of 189 ? 1192 ? the kings and princes of Christendom had taken the command . The popes still urged the war , but the monarchs led it . The obligation of the crusade now lay upon the crowned heads of the princes , and sons inherited it from the fathers . For one thing , the feudal isolation of a century before was breaking up . The nests of the barons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was still a patchwork of lands on both sides the Channel , under the restless Normans ? King Richard , redeemed at last from captivity by the last of the gold and silver , melted some of it from the vessels on the altars , was piecing together his dominion ? warring with Philip-Augustus , who was making firm the foundations of France .  | The pope urged both of them to embark again upon the crusade , and both refused point-blank . And without the leadership of powerful kings , no crusade could be undertaken . The last hundred years had convinced the wiser heads among the Christians that Jerusalem could not be plucked out of the grasp of the Moslems by zeal alone . The Moslems themselves must first be defeated . The stronghold of the Moslems was Cairo ? the only stronghold accessible from the sea . The sultan , Al Adil , reigned there . Even while Richard was on the Syrian coast , the leaders had debated an advance on Cairo . To capture Cairo , or a similar point , would be a stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of some three hundred thousand lives in attempting it the Christians understood that the overland road through Asia Minor was closed . The mightiest of them , Frederick Barbarossa , had left his bones there in final proof . Meanwhile the road over the sea had become more easy . Ships had grown larger ; the great pilgrim traffic had accustomed navigators to take whole fleets to and from the I loly Land . And the stripling cities of Genoa , Pisa , and Venice had developed into young and sturdy sea powers . On the whole , these thriving republics had borne their share of the labor of the crusades , but they had drawn profit from it as well ? being Italian . Genoa and Pisa , barred in the beginning from the East by the Byzantines and Moslem pirates , had beaten a path for their ships in the track of the first crusaders . Their fondacas sprinkled the Syrian coast , and tapped the rich Asia trade . They supplied the settlements of crusaders with the wool and furs and wines of the homelands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain of the Syrian coast . But the Asia trade was the mine from which they drew undreamed-of riches . The growth of this trade was felt in all the eastern Mediterranean . The Norman ports in Sicily and southern Italy ? Palermo and Brindisi ? became important . The fine harbor of Candia in Crete became a halfway point . But the real gate of gold was Alexandria , the port of Egypt , in Moslem hands . By enduring certain humiliations and paying well for the  | privilege , the Italian seamen gained entrance to Alexandria . And Alexandria was a port of Cairo . Every one of these factors played a part in the events that followed the closed road over the land , the open road over the sea ; the plan to break the military power of the Moslems before advancing on Jerusalem ; the growing fleets of the Italian cities , and the necessity of using them to transport the crusaders who had no fleets of their own . In this period of suspense , most of the princes of Europe became crusaders , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aid for the Sepulcher " was heard from the fields of England to the forests of Hungary . The only question was , who would lead the new army , and where would it strike ? The aged pope of the day could do little but exhort . A mightier figure came forward to take command , the son of Barbarossa , Henry , by the grace of God king of the Romans , and Augustus . The man who hoped , not without reason , to draw upon his shoulders the mantle of the Caesars . Henry VI , the emperor , was a true son of Barbarossa , and a Hohenstaufen . Already head of the Holy Roman Empire , he ruled from the Baltic to the Tiber . The heart of his empire was the German Reich , the power in his hand , a multitude of valiant German swords . He had married Constance , heiress of all the Norman lands in southern Italy . Out of that marriage came generations of strife . Yet , for the present , it raised the emperor high indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Palermo , in 1194 , he was crowned king of Sicily . At the church of Bari the next year he took the cross from the hand of the bishop of Sutri . On this sun-warmed shore , the red Hohenstaufen dreamed , with his eyes to the east . Perhaps , in other years , Barbarossa had inspired this dream . Certain it is that Henry turned his back upon the north . Had not the wayward Richard of England done homage to him , while in captivity ? Could not he crush the stubborn Philip-Augustus , if it became necessary to do so ? They  | were fighting with each other , for the nonce , and no one dared disturb the mighty Reich that stretched from the castles of Lorraine to the pagan hamlets of Prussia . In the mountain citadels of Sicily he dreamed , looking toward the east . To him journeyed Amalric of Lusignan , now , by the death of his brother Guy , king of Cyprus . He did homage to the emperor for the island ; and a letter came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vassal of the Hohenstaufen . So these two Christian states upon the edge of the Holy Land were under Henry 's rule henceforth . There was nothing petty in the emperor 's dream . He meant to be , in fact , the Caesar of a new Rome . He would extend his rule north from the hills of Sorrento to the great Lombard plain , joining Sicily to the German Reich . With all of Italy in his grasp , he could put to sea with his Germans and Normans . With great fleets at his service , he could retrace the frontiers of the Caesars . North Africa would fall , if he captured Cairo . That could be done . It could be done in the crusade . As to the I loly Land , Henry had debated with his jurisconsults and they had agreed ? startled , we may suppose ? with their lord . Until then the conquests of the crusaders , held by various little princes , had been looked upon as the redeemed property of the Church . The Hohenstaufen conceived it otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , was he not also the rightful lord of the East ? Whatever came into his hands in the East would be part of his empire , himself the sole lord . The authority of Caesar was not to be delegated to others . There was , of course , an obstacle . In the East the ghost of the dead Caesars confronted him ? Isaac the Angel lord of Constantinople , wearer of the purple buskins , who held the title of emperor of the Romans . But Isaac was no more than a shadow , a Byzantine prince who had seen his fleets dwindle and his frontiers recede to the sea . For the present the Hohenstaufen contented himself with marrying his brother , Philip of Swabia , to the daughter of Isaac the Angel , thereby establishing a claim for future use . Not that he lacked sufficient excuse to attack Byzantium  | ? the Normans of Sicily , now his vassals , had determined to do so , and his father Barbarossa had suffered injuries while passing on crusade through the lands of the Byzantines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the former Eastern Empire , himself a very Caesar , master of Rome and the world . He would tread the road toward the rising sun " Thy dawn , 0 Master of the World , thy dawn ! " It was , indeed , an imperial ambition . And every particle of it was fated to breed strife thereafter . The first step ? the crusade . Henry dispatched a disciplined contingent under Conrad , his chancellor , to Acre by ship , while his archbishop anointed Amalric in the cathedral of Cyprus , and Leon in Tarsus . Fired by enthusiasm and by the memory of the dead Barbarossa ? believing that the old hero would return to life to lead them to the Holy Land ? multitudes of men took the cross to follow the Hohenstaufen and Henry prepared his fleets at Bari and Sicily . Conrad 's forces with the knights of Syria occupied Sidon and captured Beirut ? although Al Adil roused to meet them , and took Jaffa on his own account . It was evidence of the new plan of invasion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain the best harbor on the Syrian coast . The Germans advancer ' ' into the hills and sat down to besiege the small castle of Tibnin . Here they delayed for two months until Al Adil brought up a relieving army . And then they heard that , months before , Henry had died in Italy . The death of the emperor broke up the crusade , and the Germans sailed back . They left , however , a new military order behind them , a German branch of the Hospital of St. John : " Brothers of the German House . " To distinguish them from the Hospitalers , whose mantles were black with a white cross , these wore white mantles with a black cross , and they started to build a castle in the hills near Acre . In these years , from 1197 to 1199 , occurred events that altered the whole scene of the crusades . It was as if an in- visible hand passed over the stage , removing the old actors and their cues , and bringing forward the new , to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after making peace with Philip , besieged the castle of a vassal in a fit of anger over some gold , and was struck down by a crossbow bolt granting life and freedom to the man who shot the bolt before he died . Henry VI , the mightiest of the emperors , died just before Innocent III , the mightiest of the popes , entered upon his pontificate . Henry , once count of Champagne and now king of Jerusalem , fell from a window , dying of his injuries . Amalric of Lusignan , now king of Cyprus , married his widow , Queen Isabel ? thrice a widow at the age of twenty-six ? thus becoming king of Jerusalem . The civil war among the Moslems ceased when Al Adil became sultan and transferred his capital to Cairo . And in Constantinople Isaac the Angel was overthrown by a kinsman , and cast in prison after being blinded . So ended the Twelfth Century . And Baha ad Din , finishing his long history of his beloved master , wrote these words that hold a prophecy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived therein ; they have passed away like dreams . "  | WINTER mist covered the gray Tiber and drifted through the thick ilex trees by the brown basilica of St. Peter . But the sun beat down upon the mist , and the throngs of men and women could see clearly all that took place in front of the bronze doors . They had stood there for a long time , very patiently . All their eyes were fastened on a slight figure seated under the portico , sheltered from both the mist and the sun . It was a small man , the face sharp and handsome , the gray eyes set close together . Ordinarily this man moved quickly and spoke , as they knew well , most eloquently . A few moments ago he had been Cardinal Lothaire , of the familiar Roman house of Conti . No more than thirty-seven years of age , and a distinguished Christian gentleman , thoroughly versed in matters of law and mysteries of the councils . Now the episcopal miter had been taken from his head , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a voice from the red circle of cardinals announced , " and know that thou art the father of princes and kings , the ruler of the world , the vicar on earth of our  | Savior Jesus Christ , whose honor and glory shall endure through all eternity . " Other voices murmured a response . The crowd jostled and peered , while the men-at-arms thrust them back , and horses were led up . One of them was covered with scarlet trappings . And when the figure rose from the chair and mounted this horse , the crowd all saw that , without doubt , Cardinal Lothaire had become the pope , Innocent III . A priest bearing a cross took his place before the horse . The white-and-gold standard of good St. Peter was lifted , while twelve guards ranged themselves on either side the new pope . Images of cherubim hung from their uplifted lances . Their horses sidled and snuffled , pawing the earth under the folds of the heavy embroidered caparisoning . Behind the pope the nobles of Rome bearing their shields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing ahead of rivals who were their feudal enemies on ordinary days . Knights in armor brought up the rear of the glittering cortege , and the watching crowd murmured its delight at all this splendor . Suddenly the bells of St. Peter 's clanged and echoed . The horses moved forward at a foot pace , while the high voices of young boys soared against the clanging of the bells . The choir marched in the procession . But the eyes of the crowd fastened greedily upon a horseman in black velvet , a gold chain about his neck . He was the chamberlain of the new pope , and from time to time he would put his hand into a stout wallet that hung from his saddle horn . Then he would raise his hand and scatter coins among the straining figures of the multitude . Ragged men struggled over the silver coins , and the men-at-arms thrust them back . When the procession passed the face of a low building of dull wood the crowd roared with excitement and rage . An old man in a purple robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His trembling hands held above his square cap a roll of parchment covered with a veil . The crowd knew that this was the rabbi of the synagogue , bearing on his head the veiled roll of the Pentateuch . Before the scarlet horse the old Jew bent his head . He was asking , as  | the rabbis had always asked , the mercy and protection of the new pope ; but in the shouting of the throng his voice was lost . The young Father of the Church looked into the faded eyes of the Hebrew , and uttered a few words of forgiveness . When he opened his lips the crowd fell silent , and when he had done voices shouted approval . The chamberlain tossed out coins again , and men jostled the rabbi in the purple robe to get at them . Leaning on their spears , the soldiers paid no more heed to him . Burning through the mist , the sun gleamed upon the princely cavalcade as it reached the muddy bank of the river and paced slowly across the marble bridge leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Innocent III sat in state in his Lateran palace . He wore now a red girdle . From the girdle hung two heavy purple purses , smelling of musk . In the purses were gold pieces and the twelve ancient seals of precious stones . One after the other , the members of his new court and council approached the pope sitting apart in his porphyry chair . They knelt before him to kiss the ring upon his white hand . And the face of Innocent was wan and tired before the last had withdrawn at the hour of candle lighting , and he could pray alone in the chapel of the popes , kneeling on the mosaic floor . Gone were the years of controversy and the feuds of Rome . Gone were the ten years of struggling with the questions of the papal council . Innocent was now solitary and apart . Beyond the darkening embrasures of the Lateran , the fortified towers of the nobles stood against the evening sky . Brown and bare walls , on every height , above the hovels of the commoners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel and the walls of the gray Lateran soldiers paced , and spear tips shone in the dusk . Alone , Innocent meditated , in his hand the invisible key that could unlock all gates . Now at last , at his command , was the dread authority of the Church itself . In the mind of the pope a new map was taking shape . When he sat with his councilors of state the only maps they  | looked at were queer round drawings upon parchment , with a cross marked where Jerusalem lay , in the center of the circle . The rest of the world was no more than scattered names arranged around the Great Sea , with mountains drawn between the names , and towers leaning this way and that to represent cities . Round the circle angels and demons clustered , intertwined with Leviathans out of the sea , and pagan Turks . But in his mind Innocent held a map of the world much more accurate than this . He knew the different peoples , and the roads that the merchants followed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , and where and why ? and the numbers of the pilgrims who sailed in them . All the structure of the Church was clear to him , from the lands of the greatest bishopric to the gardens of a solitary monastery . Everywhere he had eyes that served him ? his legates at the courts of refractory kings , and his messengers in the palaces of the pagans . Letters brought daily to the Lateran all conceivable tidings . Innocent knew as swiftly as horses could bring the report the fact that Philip of France had divorced his wife Ingeborg , or that a new chapel had been built in Iceland . He knew what the king of the savage Hungarians said at table , off there in the east , what merchandise the Venetians sold in Alexandria . And in turn , letters went from his hand to all the corners of the earth . Letters that told a bishop when to wear his pallium , or advised the barons of unruly England to pay scutage to his dear son John , their illustrious king . He condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he censored the extortion from the Jews of Spires . In this map that lay within his mind , Innocent was shaping an invisible empire . He meant to bring the lands of the earth under papal authority . In other days St. Augustine had written of the kingdom of God , and Hildebrand had dreamed of the spiritual dominion that would rule even emperors and kings .  | To a certain Acerbius , a prior in Tuscany , Innocent wrote : " As God , the creator of the universe , set two great lights in the firmament of heaven . . . so He set two great dignitaries in the firmament of the universal Church . . . . These dignitaries are the papal authority and the royal power . And just as the moon gets her light from the sun , and is inferior to the sun . . . so the royal power gets the splendor of its dignity from the papal authority . " He said that power lay with the two swords , the spiritual and the temporal . One rested in the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kings . And Innocent never doubted that the spiritual sword must be raised above the temporal ? mercifully but inexorably . Both swords belonged to the Church , and the temporal weapon was bestowed by it , to be used on its behalf . All power lay in the hand of the Church . Innocent was sustained by an unswerving will , by inexhaustible energy . He had , moreover , the wide vision and the swiftness of thought of a most able statesman . Realizing that the Church itself must be mobilized to take command , he was , if possible , more inexorable in reforming the clergy than in punishing laymen . He was rigid in punishment . Forgiveness followed . The sword of authority was never laid down . " And so we order . . . the spiritual sword against all heretics . . . . The indulgence of sins to all those who faithfully and devoutly aid the Church . " Never did he fail to exact the last bit of retribution . When a whisper reached his ears of a superstition and a questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to the archbishop of Auch : " You shall exercise the rigor of the ecclesiastical power against them . They may not appeal from your judgments , and if necessary , you may cause the people and the princes to suppress them with the sword . " An omen , here , of the terrible thing that was to come later . Innocent forced every issue to its end , however bitter the end might be . He said once , " Any evil may be endured to gain a worthy result . " When Philip of France refused to take back Ingeborg ? having married again in the interval ? In- nocent laid France under interdict until Philip was compelled to remarry Ingeborg , although he kept her in prison thereafter . The sword of Rome glittered with a new splendor . Of all the issues confronting Innocent , the crusade was the most insistent . Jerusalem lost , the long-treasured cross held by the far-off infidels , the crusaders clinging to the coast of the Holy Land , with their backs to the sea . Throughout Christendom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innocent could not close his ears to this cry . He could not turn aside from the march to the tomb of Christ . The preachers of the Church had urged the war , and daily the alms boxes in the churches were filled by the hands of people who gave to the aid of the war . And in the last century , immense advantages had come to the Church of Rome through the crusades . For one thing , men who took the cross placed themselves under the protection of the Church , which watched over their property during their absence ; at such times , the crusaders were answerable only to ecclesiastical courts , and for the time being they became virtually subjects of the pope . They were expected to make gifts to the Church , although they were freed from the payment of other interest , and debts . Innocent proclaimed this clearly his first council : " We decree that all who have taken the cross shall be free from all collections , taxes and other burdens . As soon as they take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Peter and of ourselves . . . . And until they return or their death shall be certainly known , their possessions shall not be molested . " So , in addition to collecting the great tithes for the crusades ? which were cared for by the ecclesiastics until they were paid out to needy crusaders by themselves or the Ternplars and Hospitalers ? the papal officers had a voice in the administration of bulks of lands , goods , and revenues . In this way the papal courts could intervene constantly in the affairs of the feudal lords . They also gained the right of requisitioning property , and  | of acting as mediators . In a crisis of the great conflict , the papacy served as counselor and treasurer to fresh multitudes . As the war flamed up , or died down , the prestige of the papacy with the common people rose and fell . Innocent was not only obligated to champion the war , he was led to do so by his own interests . " I hold nearest my heart , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Land . " There is no mistaking his earnestness . Victory in the war , the recapture of Jerusalem , the restoration of the lost churches ? these were the keystones of the arch of empire at which he labored . And from the first this inexorable man threw himself into the preparation for the new crusade . He spared no one . A tax was levied , one twentieth of all the income of the clerics , and when the silver was slow in coming in , Innocent contributed one tenth of his own wealth , and of his cardinals ' . " Prodigal with others , " he stormed at the clerics , " misers with yourselves ! " He could be eloquent ? no doubt of that . " What ! You will not open your hands to aid the poverty of Christ ! You would leave Him to be struck , scourged , and crucified anew . You , who preach to the laymen that they must sacrifice themselves ? what do you give , besides words ? Words ! Where arc your acts ? Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon your dogs and falcons . " The barons who were occupied with their own troubles and quarrels also drew down the lightning of his indignation . " They no longer pay attention when the pagans insult us and say to us , Where is your God ? Look , we have profaned your sanctuaries . In spite of you , we hold fast the cradle of your fathers ' superstition . We have broken the lances of the French . We have overthrown the efforts of the English , the strength of the Germans , the heroism of the Spaniards . We have massacred your people in such fashion as to put their children in mourning for ever . Your kings and nobles that we have driven long since from the Holy Land have gone back to hide their fears in the dens they call their kingdoms . They would rather fight each other than measure themselves against us . Nothing more remains for us to do  | but to invade in our turn your Christian land and destroy it , even to the memory of your name . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocent 's plans . He spared no pains to learn the exact situation in the East . His cardinals journeyed to the Syrian coast , his grain ships sailed to the ports of the Holy Land ; he corresponded with Roupen , king of the Armenians , and Amalric , king of Jerusalem ; he called for reports from the Templars and Hospitalers , and even wrote personal letters to the Moslem princes . Clear indeed was the outline of the East , within the map of his vision . And never had the prospects for a crusade been brighter . Great strength of disciplined men waited in the castles of the military orders ; fleets lay in the harbors of the Italian republics . Only an army of European crusaders was needed ? twenty thousand more men , perhaps , would be enough . For Saladin was dead ? Al Adil removed to Cairo ? and the divided Moslems could not withstand such an army . Innocent heard that great throngs listened to his preachers , who went from church to church . One Fulk , cure of Neuilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done more than a century before . The common people followed Fulk about , and it was said that he wrought miracles by the laying on of hands ? under his touch the blind saw again . Just before Christmas of the year 1199 word came to the Lateran that Fulk had preached at a gathering during a tournament in Ecry-sur-Aisne . Men opened their purses to him ? although some doubting souls dared ask of him an accounting of the silver . But the chivalry of northern France took the cross , in the midst of the tournament . The great count , Thibault of Champagne , took the cross , and Louis , count of Blois , with the redoubtable Simon of Montfort . Even the young damsels had gone among the knights , offering crosses to them . After the new year , Innocent heard that Baldwin , count of Flanders , had pledged himself to the crusade , with Marie his wife and Henry his brother . And before long the knights of southern Germany took the cross at Bale . On the coast of  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy abbot had said an awkward thing in Bale : " The promise of salvation is certain , and the hope of gain in wealth is more certain . " But the crusade was launched , sufficient in numbers and valiant in spirit . The flower of French knighthood ? chevaliers who held honor high and scorned personal danger ? formed its nucleus . Months later these same chevaliers made an openhanded treaty with Venice for a fleet to carry them to the Holy Land . For the transport of 4,500 knights and their horses , 9,000 esquires , and 20,000 foot sergeants , they agreed to pay the Venetians 85,000 silver marks , and to yield to the Republic one half of all the land they conquered . It was a one-sided bargain , but the Venetians would supply a number of war galleys . Innocent noticed that the treaty only stipulated that the crusaders were to be transported beyond the sea , and that no mention was made of the coast of the Holy Land . Ile approved the treaty . Then , in the winter of 1201 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the count of Champagne , a visitor came to the Lateran . Boniface of Montserrat , brother of the Conrad who had been master of " Pyre , had been elected leader of the crusade , to take the place of " I hibault of Champagne . Now he requested an audience of the pope , and for hours he was closeted with Innocent . What they said is not known . But the men of the Lateran whispered afterward that Boniface had urged leading the crusaders against Constantinople instead of to Jerusalem , and Innocent had refused to consent .  | Look for a moment into the East , with the watchful eyes of the Lateran palace . The first thing visible is the long barrier of the Adriatic , now fast becoming a Venetian lake . The Lateran is on most friendly terms with the Venetians . Above Venice lies the farther portions of the great German marks ? the German marks that have been the worst foes of the papacy . Just now , after the death of the Hohenstaufen emperor , his brother Philip of Swabia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reluctant to take the crown away from the infant son of the Hohenstaufen , Frederick . So there is an interregnum in these German lands , and Innocent will not mend matters for Philip because he looks for no good from the hand of a Hohenstaufen ? especially a Hohenstaufen whose mother was Constance of Sicily , so that the son holds lands to the south of Rome as well as to the north . Instead , he is most amiable to the king of the half-pagan Hungarians  --  those horsemen who have come out of the East to dwell above the winding Danube . For the Hungarian will  | act as a check upon the Swabian , at need . But Innocent looks more to the East , and he is sending his envoys among the wild Vlachs and the Bulgars below the Danube . He is extending toward these savage men the mantle of the papacy . Meanwhile beyond the Adriatic and all the mountains of Greece lies the dwindling empire of Byzantium , harassed and tumultuous , its fleet vanished . The emperor of Byzantium is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , and now looks upon the popes as usurpers . Years have been widening the breach between this Eastern church and the West . One is Greek , the other is Latin ? one upholds the sanctuaries of Constantinople , the other the basilica of Rome . Deftly and cautiously , Innocent is trying to cross the breach , to bring Constantinople back into the communion of Rome . The scholastic of the West is debating with the theologist of the East , and honors are about even . For Innocent can not change the memories of the Byzantines who still dress the stiff figures of their saints in cloth-of-gold . Innocent is patient with the ghost of the Caesars . Ile is eager to bring the churches of Byzantium under the rule of Rome . But he threatens a little : the Venetians , having sucked gold out of Constantinople , hate the Byzantines , and the duke of Swabia has not forgotten the dream of the Hohenstaufen ; the Normans of Sicily are like wolves , ready to hunt toward Byzantium . " Think , " Innocent bids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Swabia be victorious , crowned emperor , master of Sicily ? what peril for Constantinople ! " The emperor does think , but he hides his thoughts behind suave letters signed with red ink and adorned with an effigy in raised gold . In reality , Innocent desires nothing less than the conquest of Constantinople by the Hohenstaufen . That would place his worst enemy squarely athwart the gateway of the East . But he draws a sword halfway from its sheath , allowing the glitter of steel to be seen by the Byzantines , hoping that they will ally themselves to Rome . This done , the void in his map of the East would be filled . All the pagans and near-pagans of the borderlands ? Prus- sians , Lithuanians , and Bulgars ? can be converted to Rome ; Byzantium can be induced to submit to Rome , and the Moslems of Asia Minor and the Holy Land can then be driven out by the crusaders , sent forth by Rome . The united East would be under the yoke of the papacy . " Thy Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Innocent dreamed as the Hohenstaufen had dreamed . Meanwhile lesser human beings wrangled and suffered and snatched at the power held by others , as they are apt to do . In Constantinople the old emperor Isaac the Angel , who built a mosque in his city because he was afraid of Saladin , had been overthrown by a palace revolution , and blinded and cast into prison . The new emperor called himself Alexis III , and carried on the negotiations with Innocent . But the son of Isaac , who was also named Alexis , managed to escape from prison and fled across the seas to claim aid for his father . He went , as it happened , to the court of Philip of Swabia , the Hohenstaufen who had married the Byzantine princess , Isaac 's daughter . The young Alexis appealed to Philip of Swabia for aid , in the first months of the year 1201 . But Philip 's hands were tied by the chaos in the German states . Alexis journeyed to Rome with his shabby elegance and his small entourage of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the great pope would not intercede for him . After this Alexis returned to Philip 's court . He found there , awaiting him , a most able diplomat in a friendly mood ? Boniface of Montserrat , who also had married one of the much-desired princesses of Byzantium . The three of them discussed the situation , planning ways and means to lead an army against Constantinople . Philip would support such an undertaking , and would profit by it , but could not share in it ; Alexis would be the figurehead of the invasion ? the son of the dethroned emperor ? and Boniface was willing enough to have a finger in the pie . They all knew the wealth of Constantinople , and the weakness of its defenders . Here was a world prize ready for the plucking ! But how to go about it ? How to raise an army ?  | How they pondered the question and what they said , we do not know . We are certain only that they were there together ? the luxury-loving Alexis , the swarthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Byzantine prince would make any promise to be installed as ruler of Constantinople ? his blind father could not rule again . All of them had the same thought ? that an army was already mobilizing near at hand . They were thinking , of course , of the crusaders . Boniface had just been chosen leader of the crusade . If they could turn the crusaders aside to invade Byzantium , then Constantinople could be seized . But two obstacles stood in their way . The crusaders themselves would refuse to go anywhere but toward Jerusalem . And Innocent could not consent to the invasion of a Christian empire by the crusade . It was at Christmas of 1201 that the three princes talked together . Early in the spring Boniface traveled to Rome and tried to gain Innocent 's support in the venture , as has been told above . But , learning that the spirit of the pope a chronicler relates was against this enterprise , he settled the business pertaining to the crusade , and returned to his own country . Just who thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Boniface , or Philip . Or the Venetians themselves may have suggested the plan . But after failing with Innocent , the conspirators turned to Venice . The city of the lagoons had old quarrels with Byzantium . Only a generation ago Venetian merchants had been massacred in Pera . The present doge of Venice , the old Dandolo , had been almost blinded by the Byzantines . Above all , the republic was gathering to itself little by little the islands that once had formed the chains of the sea empire of Byzantium ? while the Byzantines raged against them , calling them " sea serpents . " Now the Venetians were to escort the army of crusaders across the sea . What if they could lead the crusade toward  | Constantinople , instead of to Jerusalem ? What if they sent the whole strength of their fleet to support the army ? Envoys are dispatched from the court of Swabia to the court of the doge , and men talk together behind guarded doors . No chronicler relates their words , but Boniface and Alexis are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the problems . He weighs the dangers ? ponders the anger of Innocent . He is all for the Constantinople venture , that will yield new seaports , and gold , and vengeance . After all , his treaty with the crusaders only obligates him to transport them over the sea . A way must be found to lead them into the Dardanelles . Time is short . Already the first contingents of cross bearers are entering the roads of Venice . They are crowding the camps , and their leaders A stroke of fortune favors the conspirators . It is soon apparent that the crusaders can not pay the full sum agreed upon to Venice .  | IT WAS then the end of summer ? the summer of 1202 . An unwonted bustle filled the canals , where the watermen pushed at the long oars of barges and the slim gondolas of the nobles slipped beneath the screened balconies of ramshackle wooden houses . A damp breath came from the mosquito-infested swamps , in the long evening hours when the merchants of the Rialto closed their shops and gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heavy with the scent of aromatics and cinnamon . From the balconies women watched , veiled and painted and guarded by eunuchs behind barred doors . For the lords of Venice were half-Asiatic in their tastes , and they had found women to their liking in the ports of Greece and the mountains of Circassia . The merchants on the bridges wore doublets and cloaks of velvet and brocades of Damascus . They talked under their breath of prices over the seas , in the slave market of Tana , and in the silk souk of Alexandria . Some of them knew the worth of furs in the land of darkness where the Hyperboreans dwelt , but all of them held nearest their hearts  | the secret privileges of trade , and written treaties that no court had ever seen . For they were tasting a new and delightful power that had been born of the sea . By the stone edge of the Riva degli Schiavoni clustered the shadows of ships , the high masts and the slanting yards tipping drowsily from side to side under the pulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war galleys lay moored to great painted piles . Grotesque dragon heads and strange impassive women heads peered from the lofty prows in the glimmer of the mooring lanthorns . In the harbor of the arsenal lay new galleys , waiting like inanimate sea serpents to be launched forth upon destruction . Over them towered the dromonds , fitted with two banks of oars and heavy square sails , with room in their depths for five hundred men or more . These were the transports of the soldiery . Giant busses attended them ? pot-bellied sailing craft as high as the dromonds , some of them weighing all of five hundred tons . They had two or three masts , and no oars . Along their decks were ranged the timbers of siege engines and the barrels and hemp sacks that held the stores . Lesser craft lay moored around these giants of the sea ? broad shallow craft to carry horses and fodder : flat-bottomed barbotes , or lighters , to land men and horses upon the shore . Men had labored for months at the quays to o. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the first time the Venetians were going to carry an army oversea in their vessels , and it was whispered along the waterfront that the fighting craft of the Republic would sail with the crusaders . Even at night the alleys and the canals were astir . Crusaders in mantle and tunic strolled over the bridges , pausing to enter a chapel to pray , or sitting down on the benches of a wine shop to eye the veiled shapes of the passing women . Wine cooled the blood , and made it possible to sleep in this lifeless air . And presently there would be no more taverns , and no more women . By the doors of the palaces fiddles whined and beggars pressed forward to cry for alms whenever they caught sight  | of the broad shoulders and clipped beard and long ringlets of a French lord . In the open square in front of the domes of St. Mark 's , the crusaders lingered to make the most of the nights that remained to them on shore . They strolled along the piazza , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aisne or the fields of Flanders . They wore light linen mantles and long hose , for they had left their armor in the barracks of St. Nicholas Island . They talked impatiently of the long delays . Most of the chevaliers had emptied their purses during the months on the road , and had borrowed from those who still had silver in their wallets . Only a few bought the rare embroidered silks and the cleverly worked gold images of the Venetian shops , to send back by courier or Jew to the girls at home . They were all eager to be aboard ship and on the way to the Holy Land . The Flemings who had departed long since must be there by now , and many crusaders had failed to appear at the rendezvous . The chevaliers did not wish to wait any longer , because they felt assured that they the chivalry of the Loire and the Rhine ? would be able to fight their way to the Holy City . So they idled through the warm nights of Venice , while the ships rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Mark 's summoned them to the hours of prayer . One of them , the young castellan of Coucy , passed the time in his quarters composing a song . Humming under his breath , he traced words carefully upon a still parchment ? for this was an important love song , to his wife : Beau sire Dieu , how may I endure To leave the comfort and the courtesy Of my lady , whose sweet allure , Made her my delight and belle amie . He had all of a minstrel 's skill , this Sieur de Coucy , and he was very earnest in making this song .  | Beau sire Dieu , now must I complain That she no more may comfort me , Where I must go . No love will be Like hers , that may not be mine again . At the same time an older man , one Geoffrey of VilleHardouin , was writing down the happenings of the crusade . He was a soldier , a simple mind , and a very honest gentleman . He was , besides , marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaders , and came to know of the bargain that was made at this time in Venice . So the count Louis Ville-Hardouin wrote and the other barons went off to Venice , and they were received with a great fete and great joy , and were lodged with the others in the Island of Saint Nicholas . Fine indeed was the army and the valiant men ; never did any one ever see so many people , nor finer . And the Venetians furnished them with a trading place good and sufficient where everything could be bought for the horses and soldiery , and the fleet that they had made ready was so rich and fine that no Christian ever beheld better , with galleys and barges enough for three times as many men as we had . Ah , what a pity that the others who went to different ports did not come there ! Christianity would have been lifted up again , and the Turks cast down . The Venetians had kept their agreement very well , and now they bade the counts and the barons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , for they were ready to set sail . So the passage money was sought in the army . There were many who said that they could not pay their passage , and the barons took from them what they were able to pay . When everything was collected , they had only half the sum needed . Then the barons talked together , and said : " Seigneurs , the Venetians have kept their promise , and more ; but we are too few to make up the sum of money agreed on for our passage . For God , then , let each of us give what he can , to make good our promise . Because , if this army does not sail , the conquest of Outremer must fail . " Then there was a great disagreement , for the larger party of the barons said , " We have paid for our passages , and if they are willing to take us , very well ; if they are not willing , we will call quits and  | go to some other port . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather put in all our wealth , and go ahead poor than to see the army separate and break up . " Then the count of Flanders began to pay in all that he had and all that he could borrow , and the count Louis did the same , and the marquis and the count of St. Paul and those who held to their view . You would have seen many fine vessels of gold and silver carried to the house of the doge , to make up the payment . And when all had paid thus , 34,000 marks of silver were still lacking of the sum agreed on . Then the doge spoke with his people , saying to them , " Seigneurs , these men can not pay more , and all that they have paid belongs to us by the agreement . But our right to it would not be recognized everywhere and we would be blamed ? we and our state . So we ought to compromise with them . " The king of Hungary has taken from us the great city of Zara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never with all our efforts will we be able to recover it from him , unless by the aid of these men . We should demand that they aid us to conquer Zara , and we will give them a respite for the 34,000 marks that they owe us , until God permits us to gain it together ? we and they , together . " So the agreement was made . It was strongly opposed by those who wished to divide the army , but soon the accord was made and approved . Then everyone assembled round the church of Saint Mark . I t was a very great fete . The people of the country were there , and the larger part of the barons and pilgrims . Before the Mass began , the doge of Venice , who was named Henry Dandolo , mounted the lectern and spoke to his people , saying : " Seigneurs , you are joined together with the best men in the world in the highest undertaking that ever has been planned . I am an old man , and feeble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am crippled in my body , but I see that not one of you knows how to command so well as I , who am your lord . If you wish to have me take the cross to safeguard and direct you , while my son remains in my place and cares for the country , I will go forth to live or die with you and with the pilgrims . "
