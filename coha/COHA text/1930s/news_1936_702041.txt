txt Confederate Flag- at Manassas To the Editor of The New York riMES ! I notice that in the illustrations of the articles on the re-enactment of the Battle of Manassas the Confederate flag shown is that bearing the St. Andrews Cross . I venture to suggest that that is incorrect . On March 4 , 1861 , the Confederate Congress adopted tile stars and bars de- signed by Orrin Randolph Smith of North Carolina . We have one of these " flags  --  seven white stars in a circle on a blue ground , and three barn , red , white , red . Our belief has been that this was the battle flag of the Confederacy at the Battle of Manassas ; that it was there confused with the United States flag , and that General Beauregard then designed the flag bearing the St. Andrews Cross , and that this was - henceforth the battle flag of the Confederacy . I can hardly imagine the military mithorities re-enacting the battle to be . in error , but think it worth while to raise the question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ga. , July 28 , 1936.
