As the 51st triennial General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church got under way in Atlantic City last week , 10,000 people gathered in vast Convention Hall for a mission rally . Dr. Lewis B. Franklin , treasurer of the Church 's National Council , was about to announce results of a ' ' Thank Offering " collected among the women when suddenly a plain churchman whom few recognized leaped up , strode to a microphone before the high altar . As Presiding Bishop James De Wolf Perry looked on with amazement from his throne , Rev. Cornelius Polhemus Trowbridge of Salem , Mass , cried : " I am not Franklin , but I am a minister of Christ . I have the permission of the Bishop of New Jersey to make a brief statement . I feel . . . that the contribution $5,139 made at yesterday 's magnificent opening service was entirely inadequate . I want to ask all of you who have $10 , and are willing to contribute it , to stand up . " About 25 delegates arose . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got $5 ? Form a line and come up and give anything you can . " Organist Firmin Swinnen swung into " Onward Christian Soldiers . " By dozens , by hundreds , by thousands , the Episcopalians trooped up to the altar . Singing fervently as they marched , they pulled $10 , $5 and $1 bills from their wallets , fluttered them on the altar steps like autumn leaves . When the last of 5,000 people had passed by , Bishop Perry shuffled into the pile of money , lifted both hands for the congregation to kneel with him in a prayer of thanks . Then seven attendants stuffed the bills into bags , carried them out to be counted-$7,916.56 . Meanwhile New York 's small Bishop William Thomas Manning had marched , not up to the altar singing " Onward Christian Soldiers , " but straight out of Convention Hall , in haughty dignity . Like some other Episcopalians , he apparently resented Mr. Trowbridge 's salesmanship methods as a violation of the good taste for which his Church is famed . And Bishop Manning may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ordained , in 1925 . Graduate of Princeton and Virginia Theological Seminary , Mr. Trowbridge was curate at Manhattan 's Calvary Church until 1928 when he went to Salem 's Grace Church . He is 36 , married , father of three . No delegate to General Convention , he went to the missionary rally on his own , started the money-giving stampede on the spur of the moment . Declining afterwards to pose for photographs , he said : " There are people who may misinterpret the incident and have an idea that it was done with some thought of publicity . " Nevertheless the evangelical fervor which he aroused was heartening to General Convention members who were worrying about finance . True , the Everyman 's Offering raised by Charles Phelps Taft II amounted to more than $250,000 . True , the women 's Thank Offering came to $807,747 . But the latter can be used only for future missionary work and the former makes only a 25% dent in the Church 's $1,000,000 deficit .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
