After each major act of Joseph Stalin 's regime , a vast cheering throng swells into the Red Square , carrying aloft on long poles horrid caricatures of the enemies of Bolshevism , handsome likenesses of its Dictator . At 15 below zero last week , thousands of prospective demonstrators stood shuffling , stamping and blowing on their hands in narrow side streets and alleys adjoining the Kremlin Fortress in which J. Stalin lives , and the Red Square . They were all ready to march in and cheer as soon as the Soviet Supreme Court should hand down its batch of death sentences in the Second Old Bolsheviks ' Trial ( TIME , Feb.1 ) , and the waiting Moscow crowd had plenty to talk about . <P> So much Trotskyist deviltry had been confessed to before the Supreme Court that a map of the Soviet Union last week was a map of assassinations , rail wrecks , mine explosions , sabotage and conspiracy by Old Bolsheviks ( see map ) , plus everywhere the spirit of Leon Trotsky , exiled from Russia in 1929 but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State Public Prosecutor 's charges and the confessions of all 17 prisoners , they had conspired with Exile Trotsky , who is now in Mexico ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) , not only to accomplish 3,500 railway wrecks in Russia in two years , but also in connivance with Japanese and German spies to cede to these countries , after a war which would unseat Dictator Stalin , vast areas of Siberia and the Ukraine . <P> <P> Japan was to get the rest of the Island of Sakhalin , and the confessions made screamer headlines about " TROTSKYISTS TO GIVE JAPAN OIL FOR WAR WITH AMERICA . " <P> The Soviet archcriminal , guiltiest of the Old Bolsheviks on trial , was " That Monkey " Radek , depicted horribly grimacing and malevolent on the placards which the Moscow crowds were about to shoulder in the Red Square , shouting exultation that Karl Radek was to be put to death . Up to about four months ago , Comrade Radek lived in an elaborate penthouse , atop a new Bolshevik skyscraper , and was honored as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Stalin 's official newsorgan Izvestia . That Radek should have confessed to high treason and blanket " Trotskyist " conspiracy against the Soviet Fatherland was too despicable , too foul , to be put adequately into words by even the most picturesque proletarian . <P> Everyone last week who believed Izvestia , now raking Radek savagely in its columns , everyone who believed in Soviet Justice saw clearly that in Arch-Traitor Radek 's case the only possible sentence was Death-and this had been predicted in cables not only by Walter Duranty of the New York Times but by all the big wire services out of Moscow . <P> When at last came the news that the Supreme Court had handed down 13 Death sentences but spared " That Monkey " Radek and three other self-confessed arch-traitors last week , the crowds in the Moscow alleys were at first stupefied , incredulous . Had not Radek just been called by everyone such things as " the worst betrayer since Judas Iscariot " - the betrayer of Stalin ? However , Communists are the world 's most disciplined Party . With almost no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other Old Bolsheviks doomed to Death raised high , and shouting , cheering into the Red Square swarmed the marchers .
