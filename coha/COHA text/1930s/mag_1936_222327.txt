One night last week the small ballroom of Manhattan 's Hotel Pennsylvania oozed cigar smoke at every crack . Cigar makers , wholesalers and dealers were gathered to ponder the plight of the U. S. cigar . As they all well knew , production had fallen from the all-time high of 8,304,000,000 cigars in 1920 to 4,344,700,000 in 1933 . Even with the recent rise of the 5 cigar , production last year was only 4,763,900,000 . The cigar men had gathered to hear Joseph Kolodny , onetime chairman of the NRA code authority for the wholesale tobacco trade , outline plans for saving the cigar . Apparently attached to New Deal terminology , Mr. Kolodny announced the founding of a promotional committee called the Cigar Progress Board , with himself as administrator . <P> " Many people ascribe the decline in cigar smoking to the accelerated pace of American life , " meditated Administrator Kolodny in a fine blue haze . " Others declare it is partly due to the invasion of women smoking cigarets . " But whatever the cause , said he , the Cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige . Cigar makers , who will save some $3,800,000 this year through invalidation of AAA processing taxes , will support the following CPB efforts : <P> This week U. S. cigar stores will simultaneously put forth fresh placards , counter displays , handouts plugging cigars with such slogans as " The Friendly Gesture-Have a Cigar " and " A Good Cigar Makes Every Meal a Banquet . " Other slogans , placards , pamphlets will appear every ten days . <P> Every day 30,000 cigar salesmen will make it a point to buttonhole at least two people for a cigar salestalk , give each a cigar * <P> To the art student submitting the best poster for Father 's Day ( June 21 ) the Cigar Progress Board will give a scholarship . To President Roosevelt ( who invariably smokes Camel cigarets ) the Board will send a chest of 500 fine cigars on Father 's Day , which is to the tobacco trade what Mother 's Day is to florists . <P> To young men on the make , special literature will try to show that successful men smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To the rushed and frantic , CPB will show that in the cigar there is hope of slowing down civilization because nobody can hurry with a cigar in his mouth . <P> * CPB formula for the approach : " ( To Customer ) Do you smoke cigars ? ( Make motion towards pocket for cigar . If answer is negative or partly negative-bring out cigar and extend it to customer-but as customer tentatively reaches for it-withdraw it halfway , and pointing to the cigar , talk up some of its features . . . . ) "
