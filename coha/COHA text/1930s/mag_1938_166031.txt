With danger of another World War desperately acute , and the chances good that part of it would sooner or later be fought upon Polish soil by the armies of Germany and Russia , the Warsaw Government abruptly dissolved Parliament last week and called an election for November 6 . <P> Purpose : a last-minute attempt to win widespread Polish support at the polls for the ostensibly Democratic Republic whose Strong Man is Field Marshal Smigly-Rydz . <P> Most of the political parties and 60% of Poles entitled to vote boycotted the last election in 1935 , because the " Polish Republic " is a mere faade for Army Dictatorship , although technically under the Constitution dictatorial powers are vested in a civilian professor of chemistry , President Ignacy Moscicki . Army Strong Man Smigly-Rydz hopes he can now coax the boycotting parties back into making a show of national unity at the polls , but not of course into ousting the Army clique of which he is the head . <P> Key to this queer situation is the Peasant Party , which must step up and vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity . " Peasant Party henchmen promptly announced that their minimum terms were Government pardon for their leader , famed , rustic Wincenty Witos , who was jailed under the dictatorship of Marshal Pilsudski in 1930 , escaped and fled to Czechoslovakia . Warsaw reports failed to reveal whether Marshal Smigly-Rydz is yet ready to have Wincenty Witos pardoned , recalled that Polish reactionaries attempted the assassination of persons who some years ago proposed this pardon .
