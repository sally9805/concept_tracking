THINK OF THE STARS A STORY BY VIRG/LIA PETERSON ROSS MM ARY put a careful edge of cold cream on each eyelid , reddened her lips , and got into the tub . There was plenty of time . Lubski would not come for another half hour to fetch her . She could bear George in the next room , stepping methodically from closet to bureau in the familiar routine of dressing . To-night , however , he was not singing " Water Boy . " He was not , in fact , singing at all . Noticing this , suddenly Mary frowned . She slid deeper into the hot water , leaned her head on the ledge of the tub , and sighed . From below the shuttered bathroom window came occasional shouts , throaty and unfamiliar . Mary shifted a little in her tub and tried to listen . It was probably a fight between taxi drivers . At home it would only jar the nerves . But here in Vienna , where she could scarcely understand , a fight between taxi drivers became a drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became grim , sinister , and somehow important . That was the best part of going to far-off places , Mary reflected  --  the importance of everything . It prickled sharply within you . You were more aware . You no longer took your days and nights for granted since they acquired an edge . You came alive . That is , you came alive inside , Mary amended to herself as she swashed her neck with soap , avoiding her face which was arranged , rather more carefully than usual , for the evening . You could not share this reborn vitality . Not , at least , with George . With George , to spend extra energy meant to play thirty-six holes of golf instead of eighteen , or to see Roman ruins , somewhere , anywhere , see them from first nook to last cranny , quoting judiciously from a guidebook , and padding the information here and there with warmed-over facts learned long ago . Or it meant , this spending of George 's energy , a day of gala generosity , a day of buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . That , of course , was lively . More because it gave George such obvious joy , such a masterful feeling , than because she wanted a freight of possessions . Two years ago perhaps , before she was married , when she had gone to dance at the Casino in an eighteen-dollar bargain , conscious of splitting seams and a brittle surface so surely the sign of cheap material , conscious , too , that the milk bill must go over another month to make up for the purchase of the dress ; two years ago , when she had to pretend to her smoothly groomed friends that to be poor was a gay adventure , these shopping bouts with George would have lifted her to a peak of relief . They would have meant freedom . But all that seemed now a past incarnation . The time when a package arriving at the back door was a whip to excitement , when a new pair of shoes carried you fleetly through the most oppressive day , when the dream you turned to for escape was about an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time had irrevocably fled . It had ended abruptly , neatly , like a rope cut in two by the stab of a blade , on the day when she saw Peter . The name Peter , just the word itself with no vision behind it , slipping to the foreground of her mind , startled Mary . Quickly she pulled the plug in the bath . Quickly she flicked cold water on her shoulders and stepped from the tub . There was a knock on the door into George 's room . " I 'm not quite through , dear . What is it ? " Mary asked . George opened his door a crack . " Who did you say that fellow is , the one you 're going out with ? " " He 's a Pole , named Anton Luhski . You remember him . He was at that party the other night . The oldish one , with gay eyes . " " You know , Mary , " George cleared his throat uncomfortably , " these foreigners do n't feel the way we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect things . It 's not done here . A fellow was telling me , the other day , about a Frog who took his sister to a place in Paris and . . . " " Oh ! do n't . I 'm sorry , dear , but really I 've heard that story before . After all , I 've been places . I 'm no infant . I do n't need mollycoddling . " " No , but still you 're my wife . I do n't want anything to happen to you . I was only thinking , darling , that it might be better  --  I could easily change my date . If I came along I would n't cramp your style . I promise I would n't . And that fellow would have more respect for both of us . " " Damn respect . Listen , George . It is n't that I do n't like going out with you . We have a lovely time . But one 's got to have a little change . Do n't you see ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only did it twice , anyway , in the whole year we 've been married . And a party with three people is deadly . You know it is . Please , George , do n't make a fuss . " There was a pause . Then George poked his head into the bathroom . " Darling , I want you to have a good time . It 's just because I love you that I try to protect you . You 're my little girl , you know . I 've got to take care of you . I do love you so , Mary . " Mary , wrapping her towel close , went over to the door and kissed George on the cheek . " I know you do . You 're lovely to me . You do take care of inc . You make me feel safe . George , I appreciate it , honestly . It 's only that sometimes one must risk a little . Otherwise safety loses its value . " Mary kissed him again lightly . " You can have the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . " It was true that George made her feel safe , Mary thought , turning the words over in her mind . If she fell ill he would move mountains to care for her . When a dark curtain dropped over her spirit , provided she gave him a reason , sound and understandable , for her mood of stubborn melancholy , George laid himself out generously to help her . George stood between her and the world , would always stand so if she kept her world within his confines . But when the world loomed beyond him , rolling into a whole universe he did not suspect , when dreams , grown dim , flared close again , George 's gesture , however gallant , was bootless . Beyond his safety lurked life . Mary twisted her hair behind her ears and secured it . She lingered over each step in the process of dressing , trying for once to prolong it . At the back of her mind , poised , ready at any second to drop , hung a little plummet of pain . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen . Plumping into the sea of her doubts , it would stir a current among them , break the stillness for which she had fought these many months , put an end to peace . If the plummet fell this is what would happen . It had happened so often before . She pulled on her dress . Then she sat down at the dressing-table to groom again her ruffled hair . The dress was a warm color , warm for a winter night , and its reflection warmed her skin . An earth color , Mary thought . Peter had loved earth colors . Peter rarely mentioned what you wore . He always said that you should not wear anything . Clothes were an impediment . They were part of the weary paraphernalia with which people blanketed reality . They were merely possessions to clutter your freedom . They belonged with houses , furniture , golf clubs , churches , and marriage , he used to say  --  all weapons with which people could stamp away ideas . Because people hated ideas , I I Peter said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hugged the tenets of their neighbors . They sought not only objects to possess ; they sought to possess one another . But once when Peter had been away and Mary had not seen him for a month , which was a long hiatus , even for Peter , he had come in , unexpectedly , and found her in a red dress . " I like you in earth colors , " he had said . " You are Mediterranean . You are warm , that way . " Then he had closed swiftly around her . After a time he had gone on talking , of the soil here and there in strange parts of the world . He had talked long and brilliantly . Mary , meanwhile , had sat quite still , thinking , " He likes me in this dress . " Across the room the telephone bell trilled , scattered Mary 's thoughts , pricked her to activity . This was Vienna . She was going out . Lubski awaited the Gnadige Frau in the lobby . Mary brushed her hand across her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you 're boxed . " She would have bound him in irons , if she could , to keep him from prying the lid off her mind . She wrapped herself in her fur coat and went over to George 's door . " George , " she called , " I 'm all ready , and Lubski 's downstairs . " George came into her room . " You have n't put on those boots , darling , and there 's a heavy snow . " " I hate wearing the things . They make me look so bundled and clumsy at night . I sha n't need them . I 'll be in a taxi all the time . " " Mary , please . You might at least do that much for me . " " Oh ! all right , dear , if you think it 's wise . " Mary sat down and buttoned the velvet boots meekly . Then she stood up and smiled . " Well , good-night . Be good and go to bed early . " George held her arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Pretty late , I guess . We 'll probably dance , or something . Do n't worry though . " George kissed her , a little feverishly . " I ca n't go to sleep till I know that you 're safe . Remember that . " Mary sighed . " I 'm safe , George , " she said . She left him standing in the middle of the room . At four o'clock in the morning Mary and Lubski were in a taxi humping along the snow-laden streets to the Prater . They had danced till the pianist closed his piano and till the waiter had stood adamant before their table , check in hand . Then they had started back to the hotel . But Lubski pleaded for another hour . One only went to sleep to escape boredom , he said . So Mary conceded the hour . All the way into the park Lubski whistled for her . He had one of those pure , light whistles pitched for melody . " The Merry Widow " careened through the night air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart . No jolt of the taxi could jar its spell . At the end of a by-road , near a darkened inn , the taxi stopped . " For a moment we will get out , " Lubski said . " Only for a moment . It is perfect to see the Danube among snows . " Lubski made foot tracks down a slope to the river 's edge . Mary , with gingerly steps , followed him . They stood together . Mary felt the silence close around them . It was an important silence , wintry , black-shadowed , piling the scene with meaning . " Look there at those stars , " Lubski pointed to the serried brilliance overhead . " What can it matter , after all , about us ? " Mary stood very stiff and quiet in the cold . She did not answer . If he had looked through the walls of her mind , if he had sought to prod what hid behind them , he would have said that . What can it matter , in the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more Peter was beside her , not touching her , yet , as always , truly penetrating her . It had been cool with the coolness which succeeds heat , that summer night a year and a half ago , when for the last time Mary saw Peter . A mist crawled up the river bed and drifted toward the hill crests . She heard her own voice , ripping the silence . " I 'm in love with you . " " Does it hurt you , Mary ? " Peter had asked . " Sometimes . " " I 'm sorry . " Peter fell silent again . " It is wonderful to be loved , " he said at last . Then again silence . Mary 's heart gagged . She put up her hand to steady it . " You see , " Peter went on , " being in love means wanting to keep . I do n't want to keep you . I ca n't . I must not have possessions , even dear ones , to watch over and care for , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must be free to come and go . I have work to do and I know I can do it . Being in love , as it is called  --  no , it 's not for me . " Peter sounded so gentle , sparing her in that way the fact that simply he was not in love with her . Peter would be kind , no doubt , if he were killing her . Mary said nothing . There was nothing to say . " Look up there , " Peter said , tilting her chin with his hand , toward the sky . " Look at those stars . Do you know that there are thirty million other nebulae besides the one we know ? That is very important , Mary , when you are hurt . Think about it a little , will you ? " The thirty million nebulae were only a halo for Peter 's head . But , of course , he could not see that . Still , Mary did not speak . " I 've tried , " she said finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't have what you want , you know , a whole heaven of self-poised stars wo n't ease you . Listen , my dear " ? her voice fell sure and smooth ? " I do n't think I 'll go on this way . I do n't dare . So do n't call me up . Wait till I send for you . Will you ? " " If that is best for you . " Gravely he took her hand . " I ca n't thank you , " he said . " Good-night . " Mary walked away , through the field , down the path . She did not look again at the stars . Her eyes were riveted on the road ahead . Mary moved a step from Lubski . " I think we 'd better go back , " she said . " I 'm a little cold . " As he handed her into the cab Lubski said : " What we Europeans always wonder about is why your men allow their beautiful wives to go out with us . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimate question perhaps ? I am truly interested . Do you not , as a woman , like to be taken care of ? " " But I am taken care of . That 's why I married , I think . The need to feel that one is uppermost in someone 's Life , more important , let 's say , than the stars . " Mary mustered a small laugh . " Since I 'm being so frank with you , have you noticed these boots ? My husband would n't let me come out tonight without them . " George had insisted on the boots . He always thought of boots , of coffee when she needed it , and of tickets when she would have forgotten them . He was the most thoughtful person in the world . George never kept her waiting . He preferred to wait . He would not be waiting now though . It must be nearly five o'clock . George need not know , Mary decided , that she had gone to the Prater with a Polish fellow and stayed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked swiftly down the corridor to her door . She took care in turning the key not to rattle it . She went in and switched on the light . George , with his pipe between clenched teeth , was sitting there , in the armchair , awake . " Darling , why on earth are n't you in bed ? " George took the pipe from his mouth with deliberate fingers . " Have you had an accident ? " he asked . " Why , no . Of course not . We danced . " oh. , , George got up and went through the bathroom to his own room , closing the door behind him . Mary sat down for a moment . She felt suddenly as tired as she had ever felt . George was trying to enclose her . That was how she had wanted to enclose Peter . Poor George . In a few minutes she followed him . " Darling , I 'm sorry , " she said . " It was very thoughtless of me . I 'm afraid I am a thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please , " Mary put her hand on his shoulder , " Please do n't . Forgive me . " His face looked stiff in the light shed from the ceiling . He shook away her hand . " I am angry . Why should n't I be ? Anyone would he angry . My wife stays out all night in a strange city with a fellow I do n't know anything about , while I 'm supposed to go quietly to sleep . I ca n't bat an eyelash when you 're out for nearly twelve hours . What do you think I am , anyway ? I 'm a human being . Our lives are bound together , and what you do with yours is my concern . As a matter of fact , it 's my chief concern . Nothing else makes any real differences . " George blinked in the light , started toward Mary , then turned and threw himself into his bed and drew the comforter over his head . Mary looked gravely at the heap of bedclothes . " Think of the stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say something ? " he asked , still muffled . " I was only saying that I under-stand . " Mary went slowly from the room .
