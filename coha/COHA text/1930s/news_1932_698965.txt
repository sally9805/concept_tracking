To facilitate the valuation of such securities the Insurance Department will resort to the ratings furnished by the regular rating services . AU bonds within a five point rating range ? that is five steps down from the highest rating of any of the standard services  --  will come under the commissions ruling . Amply secured real estate bonds will also be treated on a similar basis , but the ruling does not apply to any bond in default as to principal or interest . Securities not subject to that treatment but falling within the classifications covered by the " Convention Values " established by the National Convention of Insurance Commissioners of December 11. 1931 will be valued by adding to the " Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dividing the sum by two . In a letter informing all insurance companies under its jurisdiction of this plan , the Insurance Department also sends a call for a statement of their condition as of June 30 , to be submitted prior to August 15 .
