A pudgy little man in a grey pullover sweater stepped up on the dais at the Philadelphia Academy of Music one day last week and . bracing his shaking knees , picked up a baton to rehearse the proud Philadelphia Orchestra . The players greeted him politely but on many a stony face was a look of dark suspicion . They were tired of guest conductors and this one was a pianist . But Jos Iturbi also used to be a boxer and he would not be glared down . He smiled a disarming smile and set the musicians to work with the authority of their own Stokowski. *Before the rehearsal was half over every last one of them knew , that the little Spaniard on the podium meant business . <P> Not until last spring when he went to Mexico City did the world realize that Jos Iturbi 's ambition reached higher than the piano . There he gave 15 recitals in three weeks and still the Mexicans wanted more . He itched to try conducting . Because there was no assembled orchestra available he put an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hired 40 players . By the time he reached the 29th concert he had no musicians under his baton . When he returned to New York in the summer he conducted the Philharmonic in the Stadium series ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) . Twice the audience rose to cheer him . But Iturbi well knew when he went to Philadelphia that a formal winter engagement would be a stiffer test , that success depended largely on the response of the men at rehearsals . <P> Marvel to the players as rehearsals proceeded was that a conductor with such brief experience had memorized each detail of the music so perfectly , that by listening to orchestras , reading over pocket scores in trains , at meals , in bed , he had developed such clear ideas on the meaning of each phrase and nuance . First thing he did was to reseat the orchestra , putting the first violins on one side , the second violins on the other , to hear two distinct voices instead of one massed tone . Next he instructed the fiddlers to make their bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . The Mozart-Kleine Nacht Musik started off too delicately to suit him . " Excuse me , " he shouted . " It is too fairy . Mozart was very man . " He imitated perfectly the sounds he wanted from the English horn , the double bass , the flute . The men 's respect mounted until some were calling him the next Toscanini . But Iturbi wanted no adulation . " Please , " he repeated frequently . " The music ! I am not genius . " <P> At the public performance Iturbi merely clenched his baton a little tighter and with the simplest of gestures led the men on to do what he had taught them at rehearsal . But the music was so articulate , the Mozart so sparkling , the Rhenish Symphony of Schumann so gravely romantic , that in intermission the lobby was abuzz with the talk of this coming young conductor . The program went on with Debussy 's La Mer , the Intermezzo from Granados ' Goyescas , three dances from De Falla 's Three-Cornered Hat . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped their feet , beat excitedly on their music racks .
