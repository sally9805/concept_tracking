Production of electric power in the U. S. last fortnight amounted to 2,493,993,000 kilowatt hours , which looks like almost as handsome a number as the U. S. 1939 deficit . Actually it is a very handsome number . It means that electric utilities is one industry which is not only producing 12% more than in lowly 1938 , not only 10% more than in rattling 1937 , but is selling to consumers about 20% more than in luscious 1929. * <P> Last week U. S. powermen were frantically looking for plants with spare capacity to help out others whose capacities had already been overtaxed . They had already begun to give impressive orders for new equipment : $70,000,000 ordered since the war began . They were drafting specifications for perhaps as much as another $100,000,000 , to be ordered before the end of the year . <P> The reason for this hunt for new capacity is partly Act of God . Last summer 's drought lowered the level of the rivers which feed the 27% of U. S. power capacity which is hydro instead of steam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new record : 41,500,000,000 kilowatt hours , 38% of the total . <P> But August 1939 , when total U. S. power production was up about 10% over August 1938 , hydro production was down 8% , and steam plants had to plug into hydro 's distribution outlets to stave off a power famine . August steam plant output jumped 21% . September told a similar story . Most acute water shortage was in TVA country , in New England ( where August hydro output fell 34% ) , in the Middle West ( where rainfall had been ? to of normal ) . Part of last month 's coal crisis ( TIME , Oct. 2 ) was due to utilities ' emergency demands . Another reason for the need for new generating capacity is the relatively small recent investment in utilities plants . In 1929 the utilities invested over $900,000,000 in new plant , topping a six-year average of about $800,000,000 . Depression practically stopped all utility investment , but even in 1937 new utility investment ( exclusive of TVA and other Government spending ) recovered to only $450,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every installation by industry of high-powered modern machinery adds huge wholesale loads to electric consumption . With a possible boom at hand and more than half of U. S. machinery still well over ten years old ( and not using as much juice as new units ) , if industry begins to modernize on a big scale the utilities may have to step lively to keep up . <P> Three things now hold up new investment in utility plant : 1 ) many systems have poor capital structures and weak earnings records which make it hard for them to raise capital ; 2 ) no one knows yet for sure when or if Government competition will end ; 3 ) and nobody knows either what sort of territorial integration ( under the Public Utility Holding Company Act ) may eventually coordinate the sprawling structures of many holding , companies .
