Last fortnight in Flushing 's Municipal Court , Musician Fox 's suing landlords submitted this letter which they had sent him : " The insects you complained of are crickets and no doubt are found in most of the homes and apartments of Bayside . They are harmless , and many people enjoy their chirping ; in fact , there was a poem sic dedicated to ' The Cricket on the Hearth and in China they put them in cages to hear them sing . . . . " <P> Last week , after ten days ' study and reflection , Justice Nicholas M. Pette brought in a twelve-page decision .

Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff for the full amount demanded $135- "
