Denver 's Champa Street shrilled one day last week with the din of hundreds of urchins pushing their way to the front of the Denver Post building . At the head of the line each youngster was given two ice cream cones , a handful of cakes , a hearty invitation to come up the line again for more . This was the Post 's Annual Free Ice Cream &; Cake Party for Denver 's children . The Post that day front-paged hot weather reports from other parts of the U. S. under the big , black headline : COLORADO IS COOLER . ... It announced plans for the Post 's annual sponsorship of a pilgrimage to the Mount of the Holy Cross where religious services are held before a rocky peak on which late melting snows in two ravines form a gigantic white cross . . . . Post delivery trucks continued to block traffic on Champa Street . . . . Everything was as usual . There was nothing to remind the Post reader that notorious Publisher Frederick Gilmer Bonfils had been dead for four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that instead of " Bon 's " bushy grey head bowed over the massive desk in his office , there was now poised the attractive blonde head of his daughter Helen . Following more &; more frequent visits to the office since her father 's death , she took complete charge last week , although the nominal publisher &; editor is William C. Shepherd who was managing editor for 20 years . <P> As boss of the Post big-framed Helen Bonfils , 38 , starts without benefit of practical experience but with a reputation for general good sense and ability . Denver residents who might have looked for a toning-down of the Post 's incomparable blatancy were due to be disillusioned . Said practical Miss Bonfils : " Why should there be a change of policy when it has been successful for so long ? " <P> Publisher Bonfils &; daughter were mutually devoted . She used to say , when his journalistic escapades aroused criticism : " Papa is so misunderstood . " Last week she said : ' ' Papa 's spirit directs the Denver Post today just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " According to Denver legend Helen Bonfils might have been married long ago but for her father " who chased away her suitors because he thought they wanted to marry for money . " Denver socialites have snubbed her but last year she was admitted to the Junior League . She might have been a professional actress , had her father permitted it . Until her father 's death , Helen Bonfils ' keenest interest was the University of Denver 's highly successful Civic Theatre in which she acted ably . To her regret , she is a native not of Denver but of Manhattan . <P> Last week Miss Bonfils and four other executors filed an inventory of her father 's estate . It was valued at $8,200,266 , mostly in shares of the family 's Boma Investment Co . One item of 2,151 capital shares of Colorado-African Expedition Inc. was valued at nothing .
