Last week from Madison , Wis. the shadow of Ohio 's late Senator John Sherman spread darkly across 18 major U. S. oil companies , five of their subsidiaries , 58 oilmen and three oil trade journals . Under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act they were all criminally indicted by a Federal grand jury for having " combined and conspired , beginning in February 1935 , and continuing to date , to raise and fix prices of gasoline sold in interstate commerce , mainly in ten States of the Middle West . " <P> Named in the indictment was practically every prince and potentate in U. S. oildom . The list included President Edward G. Seubeit of Standard Oil Co. of Indiana , President John A. Brown of Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. , President Dan Moran of Continental Oil Co. , President R. G. A : Van de Woude of Shell Union Corp. , President Alexander Eraser of Wolverine Petroleum Corp. , President J. F. Drake of Gulf Oil Corp. , President Henry May Dawes of Pure Oil Co. , President William Starling Sullivant Rogers of Texas Corp. , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Shea of Tide Water Oil Co. , President Jacob France of Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp. , President Frank Phillips of Phillips Petroleum Co. , President Edwin B. Reeser of Barnsdall Corp. , President William G. Skelly of Skelly Oil Co . Also indicted were Keith Fanshier , petroleum editor of the Chicago Journal of Commerce , and Warren C. Platt , publisher of Platt 's Oilgram and National Petroleum News. * To oilmen the sole surprise was that the Government had decided to use for the first time in a big case its power to conduct a criminal rather than civil prosecution under the Sherman Act . Late last spring Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings announced that complaints of oil price-fixing had been received , that at President Roosevelt 's express request the Department of Justice would investigate . Three months ago a Federal grand jury began sitting in Madison , has since examined more than 100 witnesses . <P> Last week 's indictments charged the defendants with fixing prices by : 1 ) operating two buying pools , one in East Texas , the other in Oklahoma and the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities of gasoline in spot transactions from independent refiners at artificial prices which they sought to and did establish and maintain as the going market prices " ; 2 ) selling gasoline to some 4.000 jobbers under long-term contracts in which the price would be determined by the average of the spot market prices published in the Chicago Journal of Commerce and Platt 's Oilgram . <P> The result , according to the indictment , was that large sums of money were arbitrarily extracted from jobbers . Furthermore it was specifically charged that the defendants were still attempting to stabilize prices by taking ' ' distress " ( i. e. , excess ) gasoline off the market , particularly in the East Texas fields . <P> From the New Deal , such accusations sounded strange to oilmen 's ears . Said one oilman : " The oil industry feels like a small boy spanked by mama for doing something papa told him to do . . . . "
