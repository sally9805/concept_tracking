" That 's my first desk , " I said . " I began to write on it . It always wobbled , and I had to steady it . " I opened it , and it was a surprise to find it empty , It used to be crowded with bills , the formula for the baby 's milk , rejected manuscripts , and one prized letter which said that I showed promise and to try again . Also for several yeam:it contained a small red bankbook . The book showed a few deposits , and then , evidently despairing of ever making any more , I used it as a notebook , carefully recording what I sold , where , and how much I received for it . Later on I shall come back to that bankbook . All at once I was back again in that upstairs sitting room , littered with mending , crowded with To that desk and its five successors I have been tied ever since . I am not alone in this . Every experienced writer has more or less the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One complete novel was written on a. laundry table , moved upstairs in a country house for the purpose ; another on a kitchen table in a Maine cabin , so cold that I worked with an oil lamp by my feet to keep them warm . I have written on trains , in theaters , in hotel bedrooms , and for years in a city office , the first one having been meant for my husband 's X-ray room , arid having black painted walls . Also I have made profuse notes on horseback , on camel back , under bombardment and air raid during the war , in bed with great regularity , S HORT time ago I was spending a week end at a farm belonging to a member of my family . Here and there I saw pieces of furniture which were vaguely familiar : the usual flotsam and jetsam of family life . drifting about from hither to yon , mute and battered reminders of the past . But in this ease I came , quite unexpectedly , upon my very first desk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small one ; a wall desk , made to close , and sitting on four spindly legs . It had sat in the parlor when I was a girl , and I had taken it with me when I married . There was no prophecy about that move , no indication that I was to spend more than thirty years at it and its successors . I stood gazing at it . the enormous black leather chair which was one of our wedding presents , and tilled with small children ; giving the boys the china clock off the mantel to keep them quiet , taking away from them the scalpels from my husband 's office below , with which they proposed to operate on the baby 's doll , or running madly when an ominous thump-thump told me that one of them was falling down the stairs . Listening , too , for the postman 's ring , and , from the top of the stairs , seeing him hand in the bulky envelope , addressed in my own writing , which told of a story coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting it into the desk , and then beginning all over again . and once on the bank of a wadi in Northern Arabia. , while fearing an attack from hostile Bedouin . Unusual ? Not at all . Only in detail does it differ from the record of any other writer . For writing is work . Only a part of it is done at a desk  --  or a kitchen table . The writer must take in , in order to give out . His method of taking in may differ from mine , but his necessity is the same . I do not , of course , belong to the stream-of-consciousness school . I have never turned my mind in and let it run riot among my emotions . It has always seemed to me that a good psychiatrist was the remedy for this need of the confessional . What I was looking for primarily was material , There are two stock questions always asked any writer : How did he start to write , and where does he get his ideas for stories ? Once again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , I started because I liked to write and wanted to earn some Money . For the second , my own work has divided itself into two parts . One part comes very hard . Indeed , most of it comes very hard . Some ideas have taken two or three years before they ripened into any sort of shape , and even a short story , carefully thought out beforehand , may take a month to get on paper . But once in a blue moon something else occurs . Such an incident happened to me two years ago . I was in bed , resting before a serious operation , and I wakened in the morning with a short story in my mind , complete and ready to write . I sat up in the bed and wrote it that day , finishing at eleven o'clock that night . The next day I went to the hospital , carrying it with me for rewriting . Nurses came and went , but I hardly saw them . I sat up in my high bed , a hoard on n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock that night . It is useless to ask any writer to explain that . Other stories , of course , have had a definite origin , On the desk in front of me is the confession of a murder . It is written on a small slip of paper and was found carefully hidden under the telephone box on the floor of a cheap hotel . The woman who ran the hotel had been driven out of town , and when the telephone was being repaired the slip of paper had been found . It reads : To whom it may concern : On the 31st of May , 10 ? , I killed a woman in my house of sin at ? St. , ? . I hope you will not find this until I am dead . She had signed her full name , and , so far as I know , she is living today . The police dug up the cellar of the house , but no body was ever found . But some time later I wrote a story called The Confession from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers know them . It may take time for the idea to germinate . It was two years after I spent some time at a little sick-and-sorry house in Belgium during the war before I wrote from that experience a book called The Amazing Interlude . The Tish stories , also published in The Saturday Evening Post , began many years ago from the purely accidental meeting with three spinster ladies living together who had been adopted by a strange dog . And a recent Tish story , in which she crosses the Atlantic in a blimp , owes its origin to a statement by some man whose name I have forgotten or never knew , that it was possible to fish for sharks from a small dirigible . Stories Just Are n't Tossed Off HERE are other origins equally easy to trace . One Is day in Vienna I saw a street called the Siebensternstrasse , and wrote a. story called The Street of Seven Stars from it . And a hideous murder at sea provided me with a book which had the strange result of reopening the case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been imprisoned there for seventeen years . So much for the origins . What about the work itself ? Writers who began before the war were trained in a hard school . We sent in our material , complete to the last semicolon , got it back or had it accepted at any price an editor chose to pay , and that was that . But it made troupers of those who survived . The general idea that when I or any other writer wants something it is only necessary to toss off a story , drives me to fury . One day at my desk would disprove that , as well as discourage those amateurs who see in this profession an easy means to wealth and reputation . I have never been able to be a prima donna . Even had I shown such a tendency I had a happy humorous family which would simply have laughed at me . But the reliable trouper in this combination of art  --  if possible  --  business and profession does not throw temperament about the place . He is usually sober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is generally that of an individual with a bad toothache . He does not expect to he nursed along by either editor or publisher . If he has a date line he tries to keep it . And always he works . Not only is life always about , pressing on him with its problems and its incessant demands . It is frequently necessary to work against extremely adverse conditions . In fact , it is axiomatic with most writing people that there are no such things as perfect conditions for work . But even at the best the strain is very great . For example , a year ago I finished a long story which , us The Wall , ran serially in The Saturday Evening Post . To write it I had taken notes of all sorts for some fourteen months before I began . In writing the story with pen and ink I did three and , in some parts , four and five complete versions , an estimated 375,000 words . The completed book ran 120,000 words , The work was done in five months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day after I finished the story , I passed out , and was two weeks in an oxygen tent before I returned to consciousness . And not too much of that ! This is the work which the writer is supposed to toss off in leisure moments between bridge and trips to Europe . Or when he wants a new ear . Yet it has its amusing side . Some seven or eight years ago I was in a hospital , and was visited by a friend who was also a very eminent psychiatrist .. He knew my long record of illness and operation ; and he sat beside the bed and inspected me soberly . " Just what . are you escaping from ? " he inquired . " Me ? Escaping ? " " Certainly you are escaping . From what ? Writ-ing ? " " Would escape cause gallstones ? " f asked feebly . " Of course it would , You are escaping from work . You might as well know it . " Well , perhaps he was right . Some writers go fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is just possible that I escape into gallstones or an oxygen tent ! I do not know . But I do know that now and then I escape into writing , leaving a world I can not face for a dream world of my own creating . Once , stricken with grief so profound that I felt I had reached the end of my road , I faced work half done , and had to go back to the desk again . I think it saved me . I can write of that period now . I could not then . The first day , with my pen in my hand , and finally giving up and putting my head down on the desk . The second day , a few words ; to he thrown away because they were undecipherable . And then at last , after a long struggle , the road opening up again , an escape for a few hours , and the blessed relief of work once more . Perhaps that is why writers keep on writing . That and other things . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professionals really stop . For one thing , the early urge to write , in time , becomes the habit of writing . We are often miserable at our desks or typewriters , but not happy away from them . And most writers also must earn . It is an uncertain profession , at its best . It does not lend itself to the accumulation of wealth . True , prices are very different today . I have already mentioned the small leather bankbook , and here I quote the material I sold in those early days , and what I received for it . Most of the entries mean nothing to me today . I can not remember them at all . But in that Niagara Falls of work during the first year or two there are a dozen so-called poems which brought anywhere from two to twelve dollars . I remember vaguely only two of them , and they were pretty dreadful . There are also fifty-nine short stories ; the earlier ones bringing me an average of twenty dollars , the later ones showing a slight rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four serials and published them , and two novelettes . I do not remember anything about the novelettes , which is the way they are listed ; but I see that one brought seventy-five dollars , which is certainly all it was worth . As to the four serials , two of them I have forgotten entirely , and have no idea what they were about . The other two , however , became my first two books . One of them , called The Man in Lower Ten , brought me four hundred dollars as a serial , and the second , The Circular Staircase , five hundred . The Terror of Unexpected Success C EISTAINLV the darn had burst ! But I came of a family where my father , its sole reading addict , had had rather fine literary tastes , and I was only a storyteller , and barely that . Before my first book came out I warned all my friends that I was bringing out a penny shocker , and please not to read it . When the fatal day came I was hiding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while gratifying , frightened me almost into a fit . Every writer knows the terror of an unexpected success . How to carry on ? How to repeat it ? But , willy-nilly , I had a business by that time , although it was not yet a profession . One day I went out and bought a large flat-topped desk , moved enough of the children 's toys to find space for it , and closed the little wall desk forever . Things , of course , became easier later on . The boys began to go to school , and I had more time , for one thing . But they were not easy . I knew no one who wrote . I lived far away from New York . I had never heard of a literary agent . The name of my first hook publisher was achieved by the simple method of taking a book from the bookcase . And the letter they wrote me accepting the book was read to me over the telephone while I was at the butcher 's , the telephone being set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was much in my favor , nevertheless . There was less competition . Fewer people were writing . And times were good . The magazines were prospering . I often think that I would not care to build a reputation of sorts under present conditions . In those early days I could get an idea while making a cake , write it in the afternoon , get it typed  --  I had a little Jewish girl who lived around the corner for that  --  awl send the story off the next day . When , or if , it came back , I sent it off again to another magazine . It was as simple its that . Or was it ? I weighed ninety-six pounds . My health was bad . I had it big house with the nursery on the trip floor , and the children had everything from measles and whooping cough to 1 ? The Story of AU Writers I learned a great deal in those early years ; that professional writing is a hard , arduous and highly competitive business . The knocks  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances , and I waited nine months after the publication of my first book For the royalties to ( lone in . But one thing I did learn through painful experience , and that was to rewrite and then rewrite again everything I did ; so that for years , during the progress of any work , I am practically swamped in a sea of paper . Even today my wastebasket sees far more words of mine than the public ever does , and it is only twelve years since , with a novel half completed , I walked downstairs to the furnace and burned the whole thing . True , I took the same idea and began at once another hook . But I had been off on the wrong foot before , and , luckily , I discovered it . That is not only my own story . It is the story of practically all professional writers . Even at its best , the work is hard on the health . Not all our illnesses are pure escape . Writing requires long sedentary hours and often meals eaten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precarious . Article or story or novel , each of us must manufacture a new product each time . If we had shown judgment March tr. tese at the start and manufactured scrubbing brushes , we could probably go 00 making the same scrubbing brushes indefinitely . We ca.nnot go on rewriting the same story , although some of us are accused of it . Also , once successful , it is necessary to continue producing successes . That is not as easy as it sounds . Men  --  and women , too  --  have been ruined by doing a piece of work so good that it could never be repeated . Also the writer flourishes best when conditions are static . In rapidly changing times like these he has no fixed background for his characters . What he writes about today may be entirely altered tomorrow ; and this , I think , accounts for the number of historical and semihistorical books now being produced . The past at least is dependable . Also he is almost invariably an earner , suffering , like the rest , from depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes take a large portion of earnings . Laboring With the Pen Truly the writer is like the man who caught the tiger by the tail and could n't let go . He must carry on . He is a factory , which stops business if he has a headache or tonsillitis ; but otherwise he must work . He is lucky in many ways . He has small upkeep , and if his Factory starts to ache , at least there is uo pay roll to meet but his own . Also he has no hours . He may work all day or all night . But work he must . A question often asked of professional writers is as to their methods of work . Personally , I have always thought that Arnold Bennett had reduced that method to a science . He rose at six , with a tea outfit close at hand . He brewed and drank his tea and then went to work . At nine in the morning he had finished for the day . He never rewrote . To me , he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often frenzied days , life pressing from all sides , people , clothes , food , letters , business and emergencies , I know that I manage badly . Yet , in case it is of interest , I do try to work systematically . I have no fixed hour for going to my desk , but it is always as soon in the morning as I can do it . From then until one o'clock there is a theory that I shall not be disturbed . It is largely theory , but I go back , nevertheless , after each interruption . At one o'clock my lunch tray comes . I eat or not . If I am working hard I may take only a cup of coffee . After that I go on until one of two things happens . Either I am writing nonsense or my hand will no longer hold a pen . At the end of it nine-hour day , for instance , I may have to soak my right hand in hot water for some time , and my head feels as though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed , again to make notes for the next day 's work ; and this may go on for months . During that time I have an almost complete detachment from the world I live in , a sort of armor against distraction . I talk to people , move about , am pear on the surface much as usual . But later on I have only a confused memory of what has happened during that period . . I am quite sure that this is true of all professional writers during any long piece of work . Nevertheless . I have my own idiosyncrasies . I must have ray own pen ; pen so important to me after eight . years of use that it is kept carefully hidden , lest some absent-minded visitor carry it off . I must use a certain kind of ink . I work badly if there is anything on my mind , from a dinner party to an unpaid bill . And  --  possibly due to my early experience  --  I do not work well in a large room . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact remains that , having built myself in more opulent times a large book-lined study , for years I was conscious of the room . It was too high , too spacious , perhaps too grand . Some memory of the first little black-walled office must have persisted , and today I am once more working in a small and unencumbered plate . Not long ago I found a writer in the depths of despair . He could not . write . It was gone . It was over . I asked him where lie was working , and discovered that he had a study the size and general proportions of a hay barn . I suggested a cubbyhole somewhere , and he agreed to try it . He is working again . I have no explanation , unless it is that , in a small space , one feels more shut away from the active interesting world outside and alone with his characters . Or that the mental inversion essential to creation is somehow assisted by the closing in of walls . 0 . Henry writing in a prison cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general interest . People ask where the writer gets them , and if he is honest he will usually say he does not know . Certainly I never drew but one character direct front life , and that was in the very early days . I met a man , and later on I murdered him . He had bean very kind to me , and I have been sorry ever since . Actually I think that most writers invent their characters to fit the parts they are to play in the story , True , they change , these people . I have known a villain on my desk to become almost saintly before he left it . This is familiar to all writers , but it is generally the exigency of the story , and not the character walking away with the book , which causes it . A Pump You Ca n't Prime Style is also a subject of inquiry and interest . I know nothing about style , except to have an idea and to present it as lucidly and simply as I can . Writers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jerky , staccato prose . The ponderous ones write the long involved sentences which represent . their own mental ponderosity . The suave and sophisticated reflect what they are . In plain truth these hurried days leave little time for style per se . People read more and more for subject matter and less and less for quality in writing . It is no time for a Macaulay rewriting one sentence thirty-two times . Which leads rather naturally to what leads to success in writing . Every writer wants that . In fact , he wants two things . He wants to he both the fair-haired child of the critics and to be a best seller at the same time . Sometimes , more often in recent years , this happens . It is no longer considered fatal to all literary craftsmanship to sell a lot of books , or to be a successful magazine writer . The result , however , of this dual objective is hard on the writer himself . He wants both to do the best possible work and alsp , to reach the is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aliscouragement . There , are , as I have already Raid , ? orno Nei , who are so cocksure of them-selling that they never feel it . My own personal discouragement , however , is so keen that it reaches the point of neurosis , and I have never failed to have it . At some time during any given piece of work it overtakes me . The story seems pointless , the writing bad . I am overwhelmed by a sense of futility . I want desperately to quit. , and I have a sense of actual nausea at the sight of my desk . But eventually I carry on ; and here I think is the distinction , not so much between success and failure as between the temperamental aspirants and the professional group . The first gives up , the second goes back with grim determination and finishes the job . It is a curious thing , this matter of creative writing . There are times when the well apparently goes entirely dry . For fourteen months , five years ago , I was as arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a year . I believe it is common to all writers , and , so far as I know , there is nothing to do but wait until the well fills up again . It does , almost invariably . But attempting to work at such times is lilce pushing against a closed door . It only closes it tighter . My Best  --  or Nothing Then some morning it is over . The creative mind  --  whatever it may be  --  commences to function again . The well is full ; perhaps it always has been full . The sense of failure passes . The sun shines . When this happens to me my pen is ready , my special ink , the yellow paper , eight and a half by eleven inches , which I find easier on my eyes than white . 1 turn on the desk lump  --  that is another idiosyncrasy ; I use the lamp whether I need it or not  --  state hopefully that I am not to he interrupted , and go happily to work . Back to the job , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not only a writer ; I must try to be a successful writer . I must reach a wide audience of varied ages and tastes . I must satisfy my editors as well as my public . And as nearly as possible , I must satisfy myself . I dare say , after all this time , with a long list of published work to my credit  --  if that is the word  --  I could go on for a time under my own steam . That is , I am pretty sure of a. market for what I write , provided it is not merely words out of the dictionary . But long ago I decided never to do this . I work harder as time goes on . I have never claimed to be literary , but I rewrite everything , three , four and even five times . I polish more , am less satisfied , more fearful . There must still he the memory of the postman 's ring of long ago , and the fat envelope being handed in at the door . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wall , for example , almost cost me my life . But two rules have controlled my work since I began to find an audience : One is to give it the best I had , if it killed me . The other , to promise nothing until at least the first draft was done . For the first of these there is more than the usual pride of any professional . American reacting taste has improved . The standards are higher , and there are many people writing well and a few superbly . Then again the old idea that it is necessary to leave the heroine on the edge of a cliff at the end of a serial installment , with somebody ready to push her over the edge , no longer holds . Reader interest is held by characters , by story , or sometimes by sheer brilliance of work . The other rule , as to writing to order , has always been fatal to me . There THE SATURDAY - are some writers who work better under pressure ; but , by and large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write and wants to write it .. Or  --  since no writer ever really wants to write  --  when he can sit down , unencumbered , and go through the painful process of putting on paper what was so joyfully conceived in his head . lie may succeed , he may not . For no one as yet really knows how success in writing is achieved . Certainly 1 do not know , except that I try to interest the reader . But of one thing I am certain . The resort to the more unpleasant aspects of sex by any author as a substitute for what he lacks in ability , or as a medium for success , is sure to end in failure . I like honesty , but there are few of the facts of life on which I need or want further information . And I do not like dirty words , in print or out . As this record shows , writing is work . It cuts out many of the pleasant things of life . The author lives with one foot in an everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another more precarious one . And still he can not analyze entirely either Why lie writes instead of making scrubing brushes ; or why , having chosen to write , lie writes the things he does . Almost always he falls below even the meanest of his conceptions . I have produced over fifty books , uncounted articles and editorials , and have produced seven plays . Every one of them has disappointed me ; many bitterly , some less than others . And while no one has ever counted how many miles my pen has traveled , I sometimes feel that the distance should be measured in light years to some distant  --  oh , very distant  --  star . The hooks have covered about every phase of life I know , and some  --  like one aboard a sailing vessel , where I placed a bridge where no bridge should ever have been  --  about things of which I knew very little . But it sometimes startles me to think that I have written . so much about murder . I have no criminal side to my nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who return books and umbrellas , and insist on giving up my railroad ticket if I am overlooked . But I have written fifteen books about crime . Not thrillers , which bear no relation to life or plausibility , but stories of murder , committed with normal weapons by people otherwise normal . And I am frank to say that I have had a lot of trouble doing it . The plain fact is that a properly written and developed crime book is really a novel , plus an intricate and partially hidden plot . The writer , in doing one , has pretty nearly as hard a time as the criminal himself . For not only must the characters be real , the setting reasonable and the crime logical . The intricacy of the plot makes it necessary to hold a dozen or a hundred threads in the mind . In doing one I take notes as I go along , but altera tions often make these useless ; and also I frequently mislay them . The result is that , in writing such a story , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I may forget something . My pulse goes up , and I have even been known to run a temperature ! I do not . know how this sort of work affects the others who do it , but the results with me are pretty devastating . The smallest change , too , in the rewriting may necessitate changes all through the , book ; and if anyone thinks that either easy or funny , one day in my study would show him a haggard wild-eyed woman despairingly searching through mounds of yellow paper for the caliber of a bullet , or tracing the clue of a lost button through four hundred pages of manuscript . Yet , in its essence , the crime story is simple . It Consists of two stories . One is known only to the criminal and to the author himself . It is usually simple , consisting chiefly of the commission of a murder and the criminal 's attempt to cover up after it ; although quite often he is driven to other murders to protect himself , thus carrying on the suspense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is told . It is capable of great elaboration and should , when finished , be complete in itself . It is necessary , however , to connectk. the two stories throughout the book . This is done by allowing a bit , here and there , of the hidden story to appear . It may be a clue , it may be another crime . In any ease , you may be certain that the author is having a pretty difficult time , and that if in the end he fails to explain one of these appearances , at least five hundred people will discover it and write him indignant letters . Compared with this sort of writing , even the most ponderous tome looks simple . In fact , it is really the ponderous books which I envy . How easy merely to put down everything you think or imagine . No holding back , no telling oneself that this does not belong , or that . No hewing to the line . No cutting . No fear of letting the interest die . No wastebasket . How wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments  --  and I have them  --  I think that writing rather resembles cooking . In other words , almost anyone with sufficient determination can cook a roast of beef . But it takes a light hand to make pastry . Of one thing the reader can be certain : the more easily anything reads , the harder it has been to write . There is no such thing as lighthearted spontaneous creation , save in the mind , before it is set down on paper . Even this simple article has not been easy to do . It has been written and rewritten over a period of days . Now , in the late afternoon , I am finishing this third and final draft . My lunch was a cup of coffee ; the cup is still on my desk . The lamp is lighted , and there is a sea of yellow paper around me . Outside there is a busy world passing under the windows , but only now am I aware of it . This is writing . A world passing by , and someone with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on paper .
