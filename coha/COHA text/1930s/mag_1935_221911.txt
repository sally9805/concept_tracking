Sensing that the **25;7402;TOOLONG snarl has tied white men 's hands for some time to come , Japan boldly raised at Geneva last week the great question she has tried to keep hushed until now : What right has Japan , since she quit the League , to continue to hold " League-mandated " strategic islands in the Pacific ? <P> Up for the spunky little Empire at Geneva last week spoke Japan 's Minister to Poland , cocky Dr. Fumio Ito . Down the League Mandates Commission 's throat he rammed a Japanese thesis that because of " the undeniable fact of world economic interdependence , the League of Nations has not ceased to interpret the expression ' all members of the League ' as meaning all the countries in the world and not only members of the League , as it seems at first glance . " <P> No Briton or other member of the Commission challenged this thesis and Dr. Ito was allowed to add , still unchallenged , that by acting " in this sense the League has worked with more or less success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of League mandates as granted and withdrawable by the League , Minister Ito barked that Japan was one of the Allied &; Associated Powers which won the World War . " The situation of the Imperial Japanese Government as one of the powers which distributed the mandates and at the same time as one of the powers designated as a mandatory , " he proclaimed , " can not be affected by the fact that Japan is or is not a member of the League . . . . The real title to the mandate has been vested in the principal Allied &; Associated Powers . . . and only formally and officially confirmed by the League . . . . As a result of that fact no change either in the mandatory or in the mandate 's articles can be effected without the Imperial Japanese Government 's express consent ! " <P> These potent Japanese postulates Dr. Ito drove home with the excuse that Japan had been challenged last week by the Mandates Commission . Some of its more daring members , seeing Italy being jumped on , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not deprived Japan , as a State now outside the League , of trade privileges which only League States are supposed to enjoy with British-mandated Palestine and French-mandated Syria . <P> London and Paris have not cracked down on Tokyo , as their moral League duty requires , because of Japan 's effective Might . At the Commission last week Dr. Ito blazed , " Japan has an inherent Right to equal treatment , " with League member States in trade with Palestine , Syria and other mandates . <P> Since the big League drum of sanctions was being beaten against Italy by British Captain Anthony Eden next door , the Mandates Commission , in a panic lest League prestige be weakened if Dr. Ito 's postulates received publicity , hushed everything up last week by agreeing not to discuss them . Also hushed was evidence reaching the Commission that Japan is fortifying her mandated islands in violation of explicit mandate statutes .
