txt LONDON , Oct. ** major pa . Mica/ parties in Great Britain had revolts within their ranks this week . In each case the national execu. tive machines defeated the rebels , but there is ample suggestion for speculation in contrast between the controlled harmony of the Labor , party and the almost fifty-fifty split among the Conservatives over the government 's India policy . As both party insurrections were on the mat for issues of long-terra policy , it is fair to compare them and to regard them as indicating either solidarity or lack of it in each group . There is more factionalism among the Conservatives than in the Labor party , and them is a general election just over the political horizon . The evidence is furnished by the annual conferences of the two par ? ties , the Conservatives at Bristol and Labor at Southport . Tories Backed Resolution . The Bristol test came on a re ? actionary resolution , supported by the Tory die-hards , led by Sir Hen . ry Page Croft , attacking the gov ernment 's pending measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitting that there might be a larger measure of self . government for the provinces in India , was against any increase in autonomy for the central govern ? ment at Delhi of India as a whole . It said : " This conference records the ern ? phatic opinion that the partnership of Great Britain and India in the central government for the Indian Empire must not be dissolved and urges the British Government to assent to no proposals which would imperil the future of India within . the empire or impair the confidence and unity of the Conservative party in view of the menace of socialism . " In other words , the party 's growing Right Wing urged the scrapping of the plan of its own government and going back to the Simon commission report of four years ago , which had been rejected by two Indian round-table conferences . by the last Labor Government and by the present Conservative Government . India Resolution Barely Loses . Stanley Baldwin and other party leaders begged Sir Henry Page Croft and his associates not to bring up the Indian question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee of the Houses of Lords and Commons , but his pleas were disregarded and the resolution came within 23 votes of being carried against the party leaders . The ballot was 543 to 520 . The issue at the Southport conference , which was handled much more successfully by Labor leaders , came on a motion by the radical Left Wing to achieve State ownership of banking , industries , railways and land by confiscating properties without compensation to the present owners . The State ownership program of the regular party leaders calls for compensation . On a card vote the leaders won by 2,118,000 to 149,000 , or by the overwhelming margin of 14 to 1 . But the whole of contrast in the internal dissensions in the two parties is not indicated by mere arithmetical ballots . In the Conservative party the breach is widening ; in the Labor party it is narrowing . For example , at the Conservative conference last year , when there was a similar fight over India , Mr. Baldwin won by a vote of 737 to 344 instead of a bare majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labor conference a year ago the same radical Socialist group which has now just been completely squelched was able to impose its general strike policy for preventing war on the reluctant party leaders . This year those leaders were able not only to wipe the confiscation advocates off the board but also to rescind their general strike vote of 1933 . Furthermore , the narrowly defeated Page Groft group is still left outside the organization breastworks to continue its assaults , while the Labor leaders have taken the disturbing radical leader , Sir Stafford Cripps , under their wing by making him a member of their national executive committee . At the Conservative conference the leaders felt so sure of repeating their victory of a year ago or else so afraid of dignifying the rebels by using heavy artillery on them that the fight against the Indian resolution was left to a Bristol Alderman and one back-bench Member of Parliament . No member of the Cabinet or party leader condescended to participate in the debate . At Southport , on the other hand , no less than six former Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fight against confiscation was led by Herbert Morrison , former Minister of Transport , who at the moment is looming bigger than anybody else as the next Socialist Prime Minister .
