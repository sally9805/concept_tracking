txt About a year ago Mr. SAMUEL S. BOARD , director of the Yale Graduate Placement Bureau in New York , said in a public address that there were some parts of his work which he did not relish . He had to tell young men unpleasant things about their lack of fitness for certain positions they wanted , and he forced himself to it , but he did not like It . In this connection he spoke of the desirability of providing an official in college who would tell certain students and their parents that the boys are headed for difficulties after graduation unless changes are made in their mode of life at the university . That job , too , he shrank from even while confessing its importance . The particular instance he had in mind is one of the most distressing . It is that of the boy whose parents have made sacrifices to send him to college . He has had a limited social environment , and he works so hard at school , probably earning part at least of his tuition , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his training most necessary to his future success . Ease of manner and the ability to enter into free social life should be emphasized for him . Mr. BoARD gnen Zr. : far as to say that if he can not find time for those activities which most students take to as a duck takes to water , he might better give up college and seek education in some other way . Most students do not give evidence of a se tous bent toward unsocial relidions , " though of course all would be better off for guidance and a few present very disturbing problems . That the need is recognized is shown in the offering of courses for that ill-defined process , " personality training , " in some colleges , and in the work of organizations attempting to untangle the business and social relations of people who were not ' set on the right path at school . One of these latter , the Association for Personality Training , has tried for some years to give unadjusted individuals concrete help in improving themselves . Its annual meeting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of next month . Several large business firms , as well as schools and colleges , are represented in the association by employment managers , personnel directors , social workers , educators and others interested in the case of employes of all kinds who are not at ease or not progressing well in their work and outside lives . Although the association has the usual trouble in defining that unlucky word which means everything or nothing in its name , it makes its purpose clear enough in the subdivisions of its task . People who want to learn can be taught how to improve their personal appearance and their manners . They can change in some degree their mental attitudes , and can learn the meaning of morals and business ethics generally . It may be as trying as Mr. BOARD anticipated to inform a young business man of some defect that even his best friend wo n't tell him , but these hardy educators are going to give the truth until it hurts and helps .               @ @ @ @ @ @
