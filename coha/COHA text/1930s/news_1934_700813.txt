txt DENVER , Sept. ** defeat of Miss Josephine Roche for the Democratic nomination for Governor in the recent primary is chiefly significant for its bearing on the political fortunes of United States Senator Edward P. Costigan . The Senator used every ounce of his influence to get the nomination for Miss Roche , and the attacks aimed I at Governor Johnson , the victor in the campaign , by the Roche forces were so bitter as to preclude a reconciliation between the ' Senator and the Governor . It is freely predicted , in fact , that the Governor will seek to replace the Senator when the latter 's term expires in 1936 , hut , regardless of ' Mr. Johnson 's ambitions , it is highly improbable that Mr. Costigan can be nominated to succeed himself in that year . Had he been able to win the nomination for Miss Roche , regardless of her fate in November , his chances for nomination , if not for election , in 1936 would have been good . But , as it is , the primary has aligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State with the exception of the Federal appointees . Senator an " Accident . " To a degree Senator Costigan is an accident in Western politics . A cultured intellectual , his liberalism has shocked the conservative element here , while his insistence on viewing all legislation from the national and not the sectional angle has alienated those who might otherwise have been his supporters . His sponsorship of the Jones-Costigan Sugar Act is evidence of this . No more unpopular piece of legislation has been dealt by the New Deal ' so far as Colorado is concerned . I Eventually the restrictions imposed under the law , on the production of beet sugar , may work to the advantage of the farmers , but the latter will never admit it and will never give Senator Costlgan credit in any case . Beyond this antipathy to the Senator , because of his viewpoint , is the jealousy of the machine politicians for the man himself . He is more distinguished than they . With his Eastern background and career on the Tariff Commission , to which he was named by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national reputation , which the average officeholder here can never hope to attain . Therefore , the machine has tried to get him out of the way ever since he slipped by them to win his Senate seat , more or less by default , in 1930 . Party More United . But if the recent primary indicated the end of the Costigan in , fluence , it confirmed the power of I the Adams clan . Governor Johnson owes his nomination and his re-election , which now seems assured , to the support that Senator Alva B. Adams gave him when former Governor Uncle Billy Adams withdrew from the race . Mr. Johnson has thus become an Adams man and presumably will conduct himself accordingly in the future , which , prior to the primary , he did not . In view of this the primary , if it did nothing else , established a more closely knit Democratic party in Colorado . Before the primary there were three factions  --  Johnson 's , Cos : tigan 's and Adams 's . Now , with the Adams-Johnson alliance in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing in Democratic councils in the future .
