Last December Pan American Airways invited four makers of passenger air transports and four builders of war planes to submit plans of ocean aircraft to its unsalaried technical adviser , Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Left out of the bids was a ninth manufacturer , Major Alexander de Seversky , who promptly secured P. A. A. 's permission to submit drawings . The plane called for was to carry 100 passengers , a crew of 16 , fly 5,000 miles nonstop up to 20,000 ft. at 200 m.p.h . <P> Lockheed , Curtiss-Wright , Martin , North American Aviation all withdrew from the competition for reasons of their own . Secret plans for " dream planes " were , however , submitted last week by Boeing , Consolidated , Douglas , Sikorsky . With a grand flare of publicity came drawings from the ninth firm , self-invited Seversky , which suggested that the inventive Russian had out-dreamed them all . <P> The " Seversky Super-Clipper , ' ' at least on paper , would fly farther faster than any other , carry nearly twice the payload P. A. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; five propellers driven by eight motors developing 18,400 h. p. ; cruising speed a flat 250 m.p.h. ; a wing 250 ft. long and triple fuselage accommodating 120 passengers , crew of 16 , a dining room for 50 , observation deck , cocktail bar , promenade , 70 toilets and a lifeboat . Pontoons serve also as shock absorbers , retract in flight into the hulls of the two main fuselages . The whole ship in stainless steel , by collaboration with Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Co .. costs an unheard-of $7,000,000 . <P> Its war potentialities would also be super . By stepping its gas capacity up to 42,500 gal . it could fly 12,000 miles , carry ten bombs weighing a ton apiece , as well as a " sizable " torpedo boat to maintain surface contacts or search suspected ships . <P> No Buck Rogers is 44-year-old Alexander Procofieff ( " Sascha " ) de Seversky but successful head of Seversky Aircraft Corp. , famed builder of army planes . A Russian naval flyer who lost a leg in his first World War engagement but recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. on a mission of the Tsar 's Government in 1917 , never returned to his sovietized land . Long a U. S. citizen , married to a U. S. girl , Alexander de Seversky joined the U. S. Army Air Corps Reserve , rose to the rank of major . In 1931 he organized his own company at Farmingdale , L. I. , of which he is president , chief designer and test pilot . Many a Seversky design has been derided , but his planes in the air are fast , radical , practical , and he is producing them at the almost unequaled rate of one per day . <P> P. A. A. made no comment on the merit of Seversky 's proposed ship , resolutely held secret the other submitted plans . As a $7,000,000 price tag had already been hung on the " Super-Clipper , " it was obvious that Seversky had no expectation of getting an order .
