txt It is a pleasure to report the progress of our beloved contemporary , that incomparable magazine of medley , the Congressional Record . Fortunate in its publisher , hard times do not touch it . It does n't have to become more valuable to be more ' costly . Mr. UNDER HILL of Masssachusetts , Chairman of the House Committee on Accounts , tells us of expenditure and distribution : The largest printing bill of the Government is the printing of the Congressional Record , and last year the cost was $753.693.94 . This was an increase over the previous year of more than $175,000 . There are only 38,000 copies of the Record printed and they are distributed in this way : 88 copies to each member of the Senate , 60. copies to each member of the House and there are only 520 paid subscriptions , showing how much interest the public has In the Congressional Record . Once it was what it purports to be , a record of the proceedings of Congress . Long ago it ceased to be that and became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . The intrusion of alien stuff is so enormous as to be , as Mr. UNDERHILL says , " a scandal and " burden upon the taxpayers which " is unjustified . " As usual , the Senate is the chief offender . Not content with its own interminable tide of words , it is always borrowing currents from a thousand sources . A Senator would be false to the holiest traditions of the Senate if he ventured to object to the swelling of the Record with infinite exterior impertinences.a speech and writing . The zeal of- Senators to gratify their constituents , their friends , their pet opinions and prejudices is not likely to moderate . The sole hope of Record relief may lie in the mounting cost of the present monstrosity . Representative GARNER takes the curious view that the larger space tenanted by the Senate , with less than a fourth of the membership of the House , " ie giving the other " statesmen an advantage over the " gentlemen who occupy this Cham " ber . " May it not be just the other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer by the shameless padding which it practices ? Does anybody but humorists , sociologists , philosophers of ennui and perhaps a few forced laborers in newspaper offices even glance at those dreary acres of miscellany ? It would be interesting to know the actual judgment of the reading readers , as distinguished from . the persistent skippers . The 37,480 eleemosynary recipients may be disregarded . They are selected to oblige ; and in a country still essentially innocent , there must still be persons who regard it as a distinction to get even a public document from their Representative or Senator . The paying 520 elicit admiration and invite scrutiny . ? One can only conjecture that there must be among them industrious , intrepid students , collectors of ancient anecdote and doggerel , writers of theses on " The Art of Quotation in Congress , " cynical delighters in crossroads rhetoric . Whoever they are and whatever their varying motives , their courage and their generosity are ? beyond praise . If they are not deficient in the American spirit of fraternity , they will form the Sodality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society will be reasonably " exclusive . "
