<P> " Also aboard the S. S. Ile de France " was the way most Manhattan newspapers referred last week to Dr. Earle Brownell Babcock , associate director of the European centre of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , and Cinemactor Charles ( " Buddy " ) Rogers . A chocolate-brown third class passenger eclipsed in news value the entire first and second class . As he stepped ashore , " The Black Eagle of Harlem , " Colonel Hubert Fauntleroy Julian , " The Negro Lindbergh , " faced batteries of press cameras , eloquently told his tale . <P> Just prior to the Coronation of the Emperor Power of Trinity I of Abyssinia the Associated Press reported from Addis Ababa that Colonel Julian , " then chief of the Abyssinian Air Force , had crashed in the presence of His Majesty , destroying a plane which had been a Coronation gift and so enraging Power of Trinity I that he stripped him of all honors , ordered him out of the country in such poverty that the U. S. colony in Addis Ababa had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare home ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) . <P> Though he arrived third class , Hubert Fauntleroy Julian was not meanly dressed ( see cut ) . He carried a cane and two pairs of gloves . " The Emperor and I are pals , " he said , " and if you reporters doubt the logicability of that I will pay for a wireless to His Majesty . " <P> Reporter : Did they take up a collection for you ? <P> Julian ( displaying what he said was a draft on the Bank of Abyssinia for $1,400 ) : I needed no gratuity . <P> Reporter : Well , why did you leave your pal ? <P> Julian : I may as well be frank . . . . When I first got over there , I was instructed to revise the Abyssinian air force . <P> The first thing I did was to condemn all the French planes . That is what caused all the trouble . The French tried to bump me off . I also supplanted some of the French aviators and that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me once in my hotel . . . . Why stay in Abyssinia and be killed when I can remain alive by leaving there ? <P> When my plane crashed , I was not incarcerated . My passport was issued to me , and it reads " For the purpose of making a temporary visit to the United States . "
