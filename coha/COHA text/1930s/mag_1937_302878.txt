MUSEUM-James L. Phelan-Morrow ( $2.50 ) . <P> At the edge of a desolate section of fog-ridden moors , the grey , ancient English prison of Bleakmore was almost impregnable , had harbored so many generations of convicts that it smelled " of the primal basic filth of old humanity , of the things forgotten when the oldest cities began . " Although fogs sometimes came down while convicts were working in the quarries and on the moors ( blotting out the prison road in an hour ) , convicts who escaped under cover of it were easily caught because all outlets were guarded . When a young convict asked , " What 's the chances for a stoppo jailbreak ? " oldtimers replied . " Two million to one . . . ten million to one . " <P> This week this grim stronghold serves as the setting for a memorable first novel in which able descriptions of prison life about evenly balance the confused accounts of the breakdown of a sensitive prisoner . The story of Number 957 ( name : Alexander William Mansell ; sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ft. 7 in. ; age : 20 ; ruptures : none ) , Museum deals less minutely with its central character than with the stones which enclose him . The work of an Irish agitator who spent 14 years in Dartmoor and Parkhurst prisons , was twice sentenced to death , it is written in a sensitive narrative prose , interrupted with passages of Joycean inner-monologs , suggests the emergence of another strong poetic talent in the ranks of young Irish novelists . <P> Mansell was no revolutionist , but a bewildered weakling with a streak of artistic feeling . He learned his first lesson when two convicts got into a fight about him , quickly accepted the prison social distinction between " mugs " and " right . " The mugs included perverts , morons , members of the choir ; the others do n't " run after the chaplains , nor crawl to governors , nor run with the sissies . " Sickened by the perversion he saw all around him , Mansell was helped out by big , tough Bill Weldon , doing a five-year stretch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first month , drew him into a circle of accomplished thieves , big-time bank robbers , Socialists . This organization centred at the carpenter shop , was respected by the guards , smuggled in tobacco and books , got its members transferred to the best jobs by wire-pulling as elaborate as any in ward politics . But to keep in with the group that made prison life bearable called for more courage than Mansell possessed . For ten months microscopic amounts of dynamite were stolen from the quarry , until enough was collected for a sizeable explosion . The plan-hinging on bribery of guards and perfect timing-was for Mansell presumably to be buried under rock , while he escaped on a truck scheduled to pass at the moment . The explosion went off on schedule , the truck passed on time , but Mansell got cold feet at the last moment , was cursed by a Socialist who escaped in his place . From then on , Mansell 's dissolution was a study in descending discords . Although readers will be impressed by the authenticity of his story , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief they might feel at getting out of jail themselves .
