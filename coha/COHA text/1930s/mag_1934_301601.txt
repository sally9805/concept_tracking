Soon after the British Museum bought from the Soviet Government its famed Codex Sinaiticus ( TIME , Jan. 1 ) , a campaign was begun to raise half the cost ( $511,250 ) by public subscription . The Codex 's vellum pages of Old and New Testament in Greek were placed on view in the British Museum . Peering at them an old lady cackled : " Have they ever been translated ? " <P> " Yes , madam , " replied an attendant . " You will find the King James Version an excellent translation . " <P> Last week the British Museum was heckled from the monastery on Mt . Sinai where in 1844 the Codex was discovered by German Scholar Constantine Tischendorf . According to monks of the monastery , Tischendorf took the Codex to Cairo pleading that he must study it in a warm climate . He went to the Russian Consulate and , thus on Russian soil , defied the monks to get their Codex back . Tischendorf gave the manuscript to Tsar Alexander II who reimbursed the monastery with a paltry $3,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed all this in a long , indignant cablegram to the British Museum . The Archbishop demanded the Codex back , or else " substantial recognition " of its loss .
