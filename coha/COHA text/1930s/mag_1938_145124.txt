The theorem that " the camera can not lie " is one banality which no self-respect-ing photographer ever repeats . Unless a camera is skilfully used it can produce mechanical lies on the negative , and in many kinds of light or shadow even expert photographers do not yet know how to reproduce what they see . Under the best technical circumstances , moreover , a photograph tells precisely that fraction of truth allowed by the camera 's brief interval of exposure and limited field of vision . This fraction may be very slight or very great , depending on the photographer 's luck , care and awareness . To know where and when good shots can be made takes intelligence and a wakeful eye . To register them with the camera requires talent . <P> There are perhaps half-a-dozen living photographers who are seriously and solely engaged in making the camera tell what concentrated truth they can find for it . One . the oldest , is Alfred Stieglitz . Another is a Hungarian war photographer , Robert Capa ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurous , is a 29-year-old vagabond Frenchman named Cartier-Bresson , whose abilities sober critics have called " magical . " Apparently carefree but quick on the trigger , Cartier-Bresson has snapped unforgettable , revelatory pictures of commonplace and sub-commonplace scenes , from bare French cafe tables to Mexicans with their pants down . Closest to him among U. S. photographers is a 35-year-old ex-St . Louisan with an inquiring nose and an unobtrusive but exacting eye . Walker Evans began with simple equipment ten years ago , mostly influenced by Matthew Brady 's Civil War photographs and by the movies of Von Stroheim and Vertov . This week Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art published American Photographs , a book of 87 pictures by Evans , and honored him with its first one-man show of photography . <P> Compared with such recent books of documentary photographs as Archibald MacLeish 's Land of the Free ( TIME , April 25 ) , Evans ' selection in his own book is many-sided , disinterested , clinical . The photographs are uncaptioned yet arranged to be looked at in order . In each the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some significant things : the early morning light on hundreds of back yards in an industrial city ; four sour people on a Bronx bench on Sunday ; a pompous Legionnaire with waxed mustaches , looking brave . <P> " The power of Evans ' work , " says Critic Lincoln Kirstein in an excited but penetrating commentary , " lies in the fact that he so details the effect of circumstances on familiar specimens that the single face , the single house , the single street , strikes with the strength of overwhelming numbers , the terrible cumulative force of thousands of faces , houses and streets . " Photographer Evans himself likes some of his pictures because of their designed humor , others for a quality of care and sensitiveness poorly known as " poetry . " Evans ' ruined Southern mansion , for example , is no ordinary Southern mansion but one of exceptional , weathered , Doric dignity . A huge dead tree is fallen , uprooted , in front of it .
