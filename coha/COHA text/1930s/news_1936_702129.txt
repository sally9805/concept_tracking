txt Governor Lehman 's hearing of the removal charges against District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan of Brooklyn ended today after seven hours of oratory in which counsel variously pictured Mr. Geoghan as a " disgrace and menace " to his community and as the " innocent victim of a plot spawned by foul politics and yellow journalism . " The political future of the former poetry teacher who is prosecutor in the second largest county in the country rests now with Governor Lehman . The Governor assured both Mr. Geoghan and Special Prosecutor Hiram C. Todd that he would make his decision at the earliest possible moment . There was no indication when that would be , but it is known that the Governor has been receiving daily reports from his legal advisers in the hearing , and presumably he already is well started on the task of digesting the enormous mass of evidence . There was a vast contrast in the presentation of the two cases today . Mr. Todd , counsel for the special grand jurors who are the authors of the charges , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a picture of an incompetent , negligent District Attorney , whose actions in the Drukman murder case and whose associations render his continuance in office a danger to the community . Stryker Attacks Prosecution Lloyd Paul Stryker , counsel for Mr. Geoghan , confined himself chiefly to an attack on the prosecution 's motives and methods , with a consideration of a few - " holes " in its case , rather than to a detailed analysis . Mr. Stryker , with flaying arms and loud denunciations , depicted the case as another Dreyfus affair , and Detective Charles S. Corbett , the prosecution 's star witness , as a " perjurious Goliath , " " unleashed " by Mr. Todd in a scheme to ruin Mr. Geoghan . Frequently he leaned over Mr. Todd accusingly and pounded his clenched fists within a few inches of the special prosecutor 's head . . As Mr. Stryker roared his accusations into Mr. Todd 's ear , the prosecutor sat in his chair with the attitude of a very much bored man . The Governor and his advisers , Dean Charles K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Justice James V. Coffey , leaned back and listened with expressionless faces . Charles Poletti , counsel to the Governor . sat with them for the first time . Geoghan Shows Strain Mr. Geoghan , dressed in a brown business suit instead of his customary tropical attire , appeared to show the strain of the fourteen sessions of the hearing . He sat slouched at his counsel 's table , one arm over the back of his chair . His wife and their three children sat in a front row . When it was all over they rushed up to kiss Mr. Stryker . Mrs. Todd also was in the room and heard the attack on her husband , who was accused outright by Mr. Stryker of having perpetrated a fraud in the drafting of the grand jury 's charges . The Governor 's wife was not present , for the first time . Mr. Stryker , after working himself up to a climax , closed his address to the Governor by invoking the commandment " Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor . " Mr. Todd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Governor Lehman 's own speeches concerning the necessity of driving out " the venal and inefficient public official . " At the outset of the hearing today the Governor welcomed the twelve grand jurors who had come up from New York to listen to the final review of the case that they have been investigating since last December . The charges against Mr. Geoghan are only one phase of their inquiry . Mr. Geoghan is accused primarily of mishandling the Drukman case , and the point that was hurled against him time and again today was that the three murderers of Samuel Drukman , who were exonerated after his presentation of evidence , are now in prison as the result of the Governor 's action in reopening the case . " Not a Naive Official " " We are not dealing , " said Mr. Todd , " with a naive , inexperienced public official . In my opinion District Attorney Geoghan is keen and wise and can not be fooled about situations ; nor was he in this case . To use the slang expression , ' He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals for years . He knows how they operate . " Everybody knew the Drukman case was fixed except the District Attorney himself , Mr. Todd kept pointing out . " I ask , " he continued , " what thinks the man on the street of such a District Attorney ? There is only one answer . He is a disgrace to the public service and a danger to the community so long as he holds the high office of District Attorney . " The special prosecutor summed up virtually the entire case of the grand jurors in these words : " They are firm in the belief that the conduct of the District Attorney of Kings County should be judged by the highest standards of public service ; that he and every member of his staff should devote their time exclusively to the performance of their official duties ; that criminals should be prosecuted promptly , vigorously and effectively ; that a District Attorney who knowingly permits a delay of over six weeks in the presentation to a grand jury of the evidence in a murder case , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the murder , is so grossly negligent in the performance of his duties and so callous to crime as to endanger the lives and property of the citizens of Kings County ; that a District Attorney who fails to investigate charges of bribery of officials , which are laid before him by the Commissioner of Police of the City of New York , is so lacking in an appreciation of his official responsibilities as to be a danger to the community ; that a District Attorney who is on intimate friendly terms with notorious lawbreakers , whose office door is open to them , who turns to them for advice and financial aid in personal political matters , who accepts their hospitality at dinners , prizefights and other sporting events , who accepts their services in supplying him with liquor and who brazenly admits these relations , such a man lacks the moral fiber and the sense of decent standards of conduct which are essential to a proper performance of the public duties of a District Attorney . " Such a man has irretrievably lost the respect of his fellow-citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of his office . He must be removed . " In their action in presenting these charges , your petitioners have found encouragement in the virile statement made by Your Excellency at the Governor 's Conference on Crime , the Criminal and Society , had in this city on the 30th of September , 1935 : " ' Public opinion must be alert and powerful enough to make public officials realize the seriousness of the situation and to understand that indifference , supineness , inefficiency and corruption will no longer be tolerated . Public opinion must be active enough to drive out the shyster lawyer , the corrupt politician , the venal and inefficient public official . ' " Stryker Charges " Plot " Mr. Stryker , in his summing up , blamed the political situation for the " plot " against Mr. Geoghan , attacked Detective Corbett , whose testimony was the cornerstone of the prosecution 's case , and accused certain newspapers of having decided deliberately to destroy his client 's career and reputation . The gist of his speech was a charge of " bad faith " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Drukman case , he said , was dead until Joseph D. started to run against Mr. Geoghan as the Republican-Fusion candidate for District Attorney last Fall . Thep. suddenly , he declared . the police sprang into action , there was renewed activity , the accusations were made that the case had been " thrown , " and the newspapers made it a leading topic of the day . At one point he interrupted his main line of argument to suggest to the Governor that some control be placed over newspaper editors ' attacks upon public officials whose official acts they are unable to appraise properly . He pointed out I ! that newspapers are not equipped with the power of subpoena or other court processes that would enable editors , he said , to make a proper investigation of highly complex situations such as were involved in the Drukman case . All the way through Mr. Stryker 's address there ran the name of Detective Corbett . He was described by the attorney in these words : " I never watched more intent interest than was registered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , this great lumbering fellow , got up here and took an oath for what it was worth . " There he was , there he sat , weighing by my estimation , I should say , about 260 pounds , a great mountain of a man , with a little baby piping voice , with a glassy stare in his eyes , looking off into space and reciting that story almost verbatim that he has told so many times  --  looking off into space very much the way an 8-year-old girl would recite a piece in the district school . " Points to Contradictions Then Mr. Stryker recalled how in questioning Corbett he had obtained from him contradictions that , the lawyer said , destroyed his credibility as a witness . He referred to Corbett 's denial of Police Commissioner Valentine 's statement that the detective had said the District Attorney 's office " was rotten from stem to stern . " " To expose the machinations and the distortions and the foul innuendoes of these charges by which so long they have stabbed my client in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is why I am bringing it out before you and before the people ! " Mr. Stryker shouted . Glaring in the direction of Mr. Todd and flinging his arm at him , the defense counsel digressed into a defense of young , struggling lawyers and then said : " I say that the meanest thing in this world is a pharisee and a hypocrite . There is nothing meaner than hypocrisy . There is nothing meaner than the parade of virtue to cover up ulterior objectives . There is nothing worse . I say that we should n't have lawyers that would do that kind of thing . " He mentioned the indictment of Detective Giuseppe F. L. Dardis on a conspiracy charge in the Drukman case . The jury disagreed as to Dardis , who was Corbett 's partner , and Dardis himself always denied the truth of Corbett 's story of the bribe offers . " I wonder if Mr. Dardis would have been indicted if he had come in and consented to corroborate Corbett . I do n't knbw . I leave the question . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I do n't know . I say I wonder . " Would Limit Newspapers Of the newspapers , he said : " I do n't care how intelligent or how perfectly honest a newspaper editor writing editorials may be ? he may have and I dare say often does have mental attributes that may transcend those of many of our judges ; perhaps that is true . They are educated men . They are fine men . They are men of character , and it is right that we should have their editorial comment . That is all right . Of course , with some of those men it is a long time since they have done what we call the leg work  --  that is , get out the way these correspondents do and get the news . " But here is the point I want to make , and I think this is sound , and possibly it might appeal to you as a possible subject of study for your counsel . I am only stating platitudes when I say that an editor , no matter how honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped . Let us say  --  let us leave out mentally equipped ? I mean equipped by power of subpoena and processes of the court to bring before him witnesses . He hardly has the time , we will say , to run down this case the way we have been doing here hours on end , to cross-examine witnesses , to study countless thousands of pages of testimony , and analyze exhibits . " If the people wanted to have a system whereby a newspaper editor passed on whether a man 's good name should be continued or not , or his property left to him or not , if they wanted a system whereby it should be decided that some man sitting in the editorial rooms of The World-Telegram should suddenly decide , ' Now , I think his property ought to be taken away from him , because I think he did n't get it honestly , ' the only way they can do that under the system we have now is to have a summons and complaint , pleadings in court , testimony and judicial process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police beating of the Drukman murderers on the night of the murder . This beating supplied them with an alibi : They were able to say they were beaten by a group of men who killed Drukman . The Police Commissioner admitted that the police action was " atrocious , " but confessed an inability to find out just which policemen did the beating . Mr. Stryker said : " If the American people feel that the only way that evidence can be secured is by beating up a prisoner , I think it would be well to provide that in the statutes , define exactly what forms of torture the policemen would be allowed to use , how many ribs could be kicked in . Perhaps it would be graded for the different offenses ? so many ribs for this , and so many for that , and go right back to the days of Philip II and have a legal torture chamber . " And the Police Department ? I do n't know who is at fault . I wo n't state , I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that that kind of thing should never happen again . " Growing still more heated , Mr. Stryker turned to the political campaign , which he held responsible for the " plot " against Mr. Geoghan . He chanted these headlines : " ' Murder is safe in Brooklyn . ' ' Drukman case closed . Nothing can be done . ' " Every stop of this great steam piano of defamation opened up . The New York World-Telegram blaring out with cartoons and editorials and hostile news accounts : ' Geoghan untrustworthy , Geoghan ca n't be trusted , Geoghan throws case , Geoghan gives back evidence . Murder safe in Brooklyn . Drukman case closed . ' " When the lid was off , and the mask was torn from this pretended interest in the Drukman case , and it was exposed as a cheap attempt to abuse the process of the court and to inject the police department into Fusion politics , then the cornmissioner took the high ground that he wanted a court order amended so that he could n't get the grand jury minutes until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after election day , why did n't he do one of two things : Either make his motion months , and months , and months before the Mayor 's friend was nominated , when there was no political issue , or wait until afterward. ? " Here is Mr. Geoghan . He could n't go to press every day . He could n't write editorials . Mr. Geoghan could n't make cartoons . But the cartoons and the editorials were there , and there was no limit whatever to this campaign of libel and defamation of this newspaper , and we did n't know then that the candidate was basing his attack upon the statement of a psychopathic liar . " Still , despite all that , because the people of Brooklyn know Bill Geoghan , because they have weighed him in the balance and found him not wanting , because they know that his intimates are not that way , because they know those two sweet daughters and that fine young sophomore at Georgetown , they know his life , they know the man , and after they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand jury of the people go out and it comes in with a verdict of 147,000 majority for this man- that now Mr. Todd has the hardihood , the effrontery , to say he has the confidence of the people of Kings County . Suggests Todd Seek Office " Let Mr. Todd come over to Kings County and just run for District Attorney himself against Mr. Geoghan , and he will have a little practical demonstration of how much he has lost the confidence of the community in this time . " We gave them everything we had  --  and that is that . " Now , if Your Excellency pleases , here is the man that has broken up all these rackets in Brooklyn : Here is the man that has weathered every test , from poverty up . Here is the man that was good enough for one of the highest-class educational institutions in the city , in the country , the City College  --  a cultured , re , fined gentleman , an educated , highclass lawyer , practicing in the civil courts and the Surrogates ' Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now a distinguished jurist . " Then he was elected three times District Attorney of his county , the last time after the meanest , the I most contemptible attack that any man ever encountered at the polls . And here he is . And out of his 43,000 cases they find one case , they say , mismanaged , and , they say that makes him incompetent . And they find two people , they say , with whom he should not have associated . " Mr. Stryker did not dwell at any length on Leo P. Byk , the slot machine operator , and Frank A. Erickson , the bookmaker . He attempted to show that the prose- I cution had failed utterly in connecting Byk and Erickson to the Drukman case itself , and he argued that the only reason they were mentioned in the charges was for the purpose of " poisoning " the atmosphere . " This unconnected proof ! " he exclaimed . " My , what a thing for a lawyer to do ! You could excuse a layman . I do n't criticize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I will say this . If I have tired out the ears of the Governor of the State and his advisers , I am sorry , but if I could summon to this room now the thunderous voice of the great Jehovah when from Mount Sinai he spoke to Moses , I would use that voice and say what he said to Moses : ' Thou shalt not bear false . witness against thy neighbor . ' " Todd Reads Address Mr. Todd 's address , which by agreement was delivered first , was read by him from a typewritten manuscript . He occasionally lifted his fist and brought it down with a resounding smack on his desk , but he engaged in no histrionics . He recalled the murder scene , the bloodstained murderers , the warm body , the canvas bag . " The District Attorney was present there that night in the station house , " he said . " He saw those murderers with the blood on their hands and the blood on their clothes . " He ran through the specifications , taking up each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor of his own reaction when he was called into the case to supersede Mr. Geoghan : I " What was the first thing that the special prosecutor appointed by you did when he came into this case ? He asked for the April grand jury minutes , and he read them and , having read them , he says , ' This case stinks to the heavens ; something is rotten with that jury . ' And he got a list of the members of that grand jury , and he has it in his pocket here ; he has carried it ever since that time , and that is where he started his investigation . " It was by the interrogation of the men on that April grand jury that his hand was laid upon the string that , having been pulled and pulled and pulled , led us to the evidence that has been brought to the extraordinary grand jury ; brought about the conviction of the three murderers and the conviction of four of the defendants in the conspiracy case for obstructing justice . " Mr. Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the April grand jury had exonerated the murderers . " And he expressed surprise  --  that is all . " Why , sir , what would a District Attorney who was in earnest and alive to the duties of his office have done in the premises ? The first thing he would have done would have been to call in his assistants who presented the case and he would have asked for a report and said , ' What is the trouble ? ' " Did Geoghan do that ? No ! " If the District Attorney had done his duty it never would have been necessary for Your Excellency to have convened an extraordinary term of court . The man on the street would not have asked , and continued to ask until this day , what happened in the Drukman case . I say to you , sir , that to condone this flagrant disregard of his primary duty and responsibility would set a precedent which , if relied upon by other prosecuting officials in this State , would make law enforcement a comedy of justice . " Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attempts to get Mr. Geoghan to resubmit the case  --  a matter in dispute with the District Attorney  --  and continued ' I ' : t was only because of that spotlight of publicity through the press that the day before election , for the first time , the District Attorney dis- I cussed with his assistants whether or not the case should be resubmitted . Remember now , May 10 the case had been dismissed , June 10 , July 10 , Aug. 10 , Sept. 10 , Nov. 10 ? five months of doing absolutely nothing looking toward the resubmission of the case ; and all that time Valentine had been cracking the whip , but had got no result . The application was not made until the District Attorney was driven to it by the publicity given to his failure to properly prosecute this case . " Mr. Todd characterized the charge of failing to prosecute properly the I ( bribery evidence reported to him by Corbett and the Police Commissioner as the strongest of all charges against Mr. Geoghan . " Your Excellency 's ruling upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the standards by which prosecutors in every county of this State may henceforth measure their conduct . The right ruling will do more for the protection of the lives and happiness of the citizens of this great State than a ream of new laws yet to be written upon the statute books . For , after all , what good are penal laws if prosecutors are to be condoned in an escape from their sworn duty to faithfully enforEe the law ? " The utterances of platitudes by public officials who speak with their tongues in their cheeks but who fail to act and hold themselves to high standards of conduct have dampened community faith in their officials . A virile ruling here , sir , will awaken an enthusiastic response in every community in this State . Geoghan Praised Corbett " What was there about Detective Corbett which made Mr. Geoghan come to the instantaneous conclusion that he was crazy ? Was it be-1 cause in 1931 Mr. Geoghan had written a letter to the police cornmissioner in which he used this I language in praise of Corbett : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wel- I come knowledge at his command . ' His work in this particular case stamps him as one of the outstanding members of your department . ' " Your Excellency , in viewing , in considering Corbett , remember these things . If Corbett is crazy and his charges not worthy of investigation , then the November grand jury were wrong in their estimate , the extraordinary grand jury were wrong in their estimate , the trial jury at the murder case was wrong , the petit jury at the conspiracy case was wrong , and Justice Rogers was wrong , after listening to Corbett testify in the conspiracy trial . " Turning to the Byk and Erickson specification , Mr. Todd said : " There could be no misunderstanding of what we mean by the District Attorney 's association with Byk , and of how that contributed to his failure in the Drukman case . We do not charge these associations were the sole cause of his failure . We do not charge his willful neglect was due to these two men at all . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the causes of his willful neglect , and we maintain that the truth of this charge must be apparent to Your Excellency in the face of the facts . " One of these men was engaged , in Brooklyn , in a business which is clearly illegal under the laws of the State of New York , although the District Attorney says he was saved from illegality by a cotter pin . The other of these men was in a business also condemned by the laws of the State of New York , although the District Attorney says he was saved from illegality by a telephone line under the Hudson River and his business was not illegal in Ireland . " We charge that the friendship for-Leo and Frank was one of the reasons why he did not question them . We charge that if he had . questioned them he would have found evidence of their connection with the conspiracy to fix the Lockman case , and he would have been aided in the prosecution of that case . " How did this friendship between Byk and Assistant District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says that Byk was a friend of the District Attorney 's . He no doubt believed that the friendship of Byk would advance him . He has testified that he cultivated him more than he did other men . Byk also seems to have cultivated members of the Police Department . The District Attorney himself has testified concerning his deep concern forDetective Diamond . " Why , did Leo cultivate Bill ? " he demanded . " What business did Leo P. Byk have in the District Attors ney 's office ? What possible legiti " mate business could he have there ? , How was it that he could open Bata shay 's door and say , ' Hello , Hymie , r. and walk ha to see ' Bill ' as a social friend ? Did that tend to promote the confidence of the man in the street in the way the District Ait ? torney 's office was being run ? Or did it advertise that Byk had a pipe line to the District Attorney 's office ? " If the District Attorney of the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws , he would not only run Leo P. Byk out of his . office ; he would search the penal law from end to end to find some way of running him out of the county with his nefarious business . " Mr. Todd closed with an analysis of the relation between Mr. Geoghan. and Erickson , the bookmaker , and particularly with the $500 campaign gift given to Mr. Geoghan last Fall from funds supplied by Erickson . This was reported , however , as coming from Erickson 's attorney . " Again , I ask , ' What thinks the man on the street of such a District Attorney ? ' There is only one answer . He is a disgrace to the public service and a danger to the community so long as he holds the high office of District Attorney . " Statement by Governor After the addresses of counsel the Governor made a brief statement . He said : " I have been deeply conscious at all times of the solemn duty imposed upon me as Governor . I recognized a two-fold obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to the accused . I am satisfied that I have discharged both obligations . " I have afforded the District Attorney every opportunity of pmsenting his case in his own way , with no handicap of technical limitations . I have permitted the introduction by counsel for the petitioners of all evidence that might have had even a remote bearing on the charges before me . I did this so that no facts would he kept either from me or from the people of the State . " I shall give to the evidence such weight as I think it deserves . Every word of the evidence and testimony is a matter of public record . " As soon as the hearing was over Mr. Geoghan and Mr. Todd prepared to leave for their Summer places for a few days ' rest . Mr. Todd expected to pass his time at Saratoga , and Mr. Geoghan in Monroe , N. Y. Members of their staffs motored down to New York later in the evening .                @ @ @ @ @
