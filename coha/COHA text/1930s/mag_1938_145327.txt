Dramatic School ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . In Manhattan last fortnight , critics were delighted by the premiere of Ballerina , which , made in France , concerned itself with the hopes and perplexities of Paris ballet students . In Manhattan this week , critics will have the opportunity of comparing Ballerina with a picture which , made in Hollywood , concerns itself with the hopes and perplexities of Paris drama students . Unlike the moppet personnel of Ballerina , the personnel of Dramatic School are full-grown young actresses . Unlike the cast of Ballerina , mostly made up of real students in the French National Opera school , the cast of Dramatic School are all Hollywood professionals , most notably Luise Rainer and Paulette Goddard . <P> Hollywood 's champion long-distance emotional gamut-runner , Luise Rainer has a real field day in Dramatic School . Her rich part requires her to twitch out the interpretation of a factory girl so anxious to perfect her histrionic technique that she constantly tells lies so that she will have to practice acting . The part also requires her to run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angel voices , as Joan of Arc . Poor little Paulette Goddard-co-starred presumably as part of the build-up for a forthcoming appearance as Scarlett O'Hara-comes off second-best but , as a more sophisticated inmate of the Ecole Nationale des Arts Dramatiques she wears her clothes well and conveys an air of sullen , anti-social charm . <P> Among Hollywood celebrities , a special niche is reserved for phantom actresses- young women who become internationally celebrated as movie stars without appearing on the screen . In this niche , Paulette Goddard 's place is secure . Until last month , she had appeared in only two pictures . In the first , The Kid from Spain , she was a chorus girl . In the second , Modern Times , she did not talk . Since Modern Times she has maintained an apparently impregnable position in U. S. headlines , first as the centre of the controversy about whether or not she was married to Charlie Chaplin , then as the centre of the controversy about who would play Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind . Last week the persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Roy Howard 's World-Telegram and again denied . Cinemaddicts concluded that , since Gone With the Wind has become practically a phantom picture , Paulette as Scarlett would be good casting to type . <P> No phantom , Paulette Goddard is actually an amiable little brunette ( 5 ft. 4 in. , weight no ) who , born and reared in Great Neck , L. I. , entered public life at twelve , as a model for children 's clothes . At 16 , she married Edward James , Broadwayite twice her age , whom she divorced five years later . Paulette Goddard prepared herself for her Hollywood phantom career by appearing as a chorus girl in Rio Rita . Her appearance as co-star in Dramatic School is not quite her first since Modern Times . She also made an effective talkie debut in The Young in Heart . <P> More distinguished than any of her performances thus far as a mere working actress was Paulette Goddard 's farewell performance as a phantom actress . Last winter , after breaking one of her nails , which were almost an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in a sling .
