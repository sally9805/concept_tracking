Strapped onto a massive chair in a room gradually filling with gas fumes , a husky , 20-year-old Negro in white trunks coughed , clenched his fists , expanded his chest and fiercely cried : " Joe Louis ! " Such was the death two years ago of Allen Foster , first criminal to be executed in the lethal gas chamber of the North Carolina State Prison at Raleigh . The Foster execution lasted eleven minutes , provoked a storm of newspaper criticism . Today lethal gas executions are legal in six States besides North Carolina-Colorado , Nevada , Arizona , Missouri , Wyoming , and Cali-fornia-and are increasingly efficient , but to many conservative criminals and laymen alike the humdrum noose or electric chair still seems safer . <P> Last week 30 spectators flattened their noses curiously , against a bullet-proof glass wall in California 's San Quentin prison to watch a preview of a lethal chamber which its makers , Eaton Metal Products Co. of Denver , thought would end all such doubt . Resting on a chair inside was a cage in which waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropping 16 cyanide eggs into pans of sulfuric acid , thin blue fumes began to rise toward the cage . The pig jumped , squealed , flapped its ears , rolled over . Like Allen Foster , the San Quentin pig died hard . Nine times the pig staggered to its feet and collapsed . The ninth time , three minutes and 25 seconds later , its corkscrew tail straightened out rigid in death . After the gas was blown out and the pig removed , opinions remained divided . Most of the newspapermen spectators professed themselves horrified . Queasy Warden Court Smith confessed that he had turned his eyes away . But W. H. Rockingham of the State Department of Architecture , who had supervised the construction of the chamber , expressed his satisfaction , announced that he would recommend that the State accept the chamber and pay the contractors their $4,950 fee . The five men in San Quentin 's death row scheduled to enter the chamber next , thought Mr. Rockingham , should die in 15 seconds .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
