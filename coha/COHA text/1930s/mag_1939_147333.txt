Tibet is a windswept highland where the chief drink is buttered tea , the chief fuel is yak dung , and a stuck-out tongue is a friendly greeting . Faith of the 3,000,000 Tibetans-and of other millions throughout the fastnesses of Central Asia-is Lamaism , a theocratic form of Buddhism . Lamaists believe in numerous divine incarnations , chief of them the Dalai Lama , " Buddha of Mercy , " who is not only temporal ruler of Tibet but a god . Since the death of Ngawang Lopsang Toupden Gyatso in 1933 , Tibet has been ruled by a council of lamas . Last month , a new Dalai Lama was discovered* in a remote village of Kokonor . Last week his caravan was winding through snow-swept mountain passes toward his sacred city of Lhasa . <P> Until his satisfactory identification through omens , portents , visions &; oracles , this 14th reincarnation of Buddha was a 5-year-old peasant boy named Tanchu , " quiet mannered with bright penetrating eyes . " Now Tanchu will live in a gold-domed penthouse atop the Potala , his massive fortress-palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lama regency learning about his previous incarnations and the intricate Lamaist ritual . If he reaches the age of 18 he will be consecrated , rule for the rest of his days . <P> A familiar Tibetan figure is the sinister Tzuren or poison-doctor , who practices his art to keep the ins in and the outs out . In modern times , only Dalai Lama who did not die mysteriously before reaching his majority has been Ngawang Lopsang Toupden Gyatso . In 1893 , shortly before he took office , he thoughtfully ordered his regent and other advisers thrown into dungeons . As " Buddha of Mercy " he then had a long and prosperous life . If the 14th Reincarnation learns this much about the 13th , he may think it wise to do the same . <P> <P> *Such a discovery , reported intermittently for years ( TIME , Dec. 13 , 1937 ) , this time appears genuine .
