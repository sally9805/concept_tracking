The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 passed into U. S. history one January afternoon in 1936 , when Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts began reading the majority Supreme Court decision in U. S. v. Butler et al. , receivers of Hoosac Mills Corp . The AAA of 1938 has yet to reach the Supreme Court . But last week two of the men most prominently identified with it set out to argue its case before the tribunal of public opinion . One demanded an outright conviction for failure , the other appealed for a suspended sentence . <P> Mad Farmers . South Carolina 's Ellison D. ( " Cotton Ed ' ' ) Smith took a long time to make up his mind whether he was proud or ashamed of the fact that , as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture , he brought the second AAA to the Senate floor this year . In his recent campaign he sometimes blamed the bill on the New Deal , sometimes claimed credit for it . Last week , with cotton prices tumbling under a bumper August carryover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cotton Ed set his weather-vane for good . <P> He and seven other cotton Senators- Georgia 's George and Russell , North Carolina 's Reynolds , Mississippi 's Harrison and Bilbo , Missouri 's Clark , Oklahoma 's Elmer Thomas-marched on Washington to demand that the Government 's present 8.3% cotton loans be upped to the 11.75 maximum ( 75% of parity ) possible under the Act . There they were told that the President was too busy , advised to take their grievances to AAA . Cotton Ed snorted : " These farmers are mad . Why should n't they be ? ... I have served here under five Presidents preceding this one . I never was refused an audience and I never was asked what my business was before this . " " Do you want to be quoted on that ? " cautioned his secretary . <P> " Hell , yes , I do . Why not ? " Surest Way . To Secretary of Agriculture Wallace AAA has recently come to stand for ache , agony and anguish . In defense of AAA he has argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the Dust Bowl bloomed this year ) than to any serious defect in the Act . But in spite of the most far reaching crop control laws ever enacted , all three major U. S. crops are in trouble . Wheat , with a near-record crop of 940,000,000 bushels and a whopping 300.000,000 bushel carryover in prospect for next year , has stumbled to 50 a bushel on the farm ( against $1.25 in 1936 ) . A plan to subsidize export of 100,000,000 bushels has been so snagged by record surpluses abroad that only 10,000,000 bushels had been moved out by last week . AAA estimated that this year 's corn crop was not so large that compulsory marketing quotas need be applied , but corn last week sold at 5 compared to 65 a year ago . The crisis in cotton , where compulsory marketing has been imposed , was so grave that Oklahoma 's Thomas , a faithful New Dealer , reported last week that cotton farmers in his State were deserting their land to go on Relief . <P> Taking his courage in both hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers at Hutchinson , Kans. and-cotton growers in Fort Worth , and promised to talk next week to corn farmers at Springfield , Ill . " Fight for the program that you have , " he urged , then revealed what he thought should be done to AAA II to make it work .
