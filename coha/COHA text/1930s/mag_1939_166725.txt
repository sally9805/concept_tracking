One morning last week 356 delegates to " Homer Martin 's convention " in Detroit voted their United Automobile Workers of America out of C. I. O. , which had already booted them out . That afternoon they negligently passed the same resolution all over again , cheering lustily and voting to wire a copy to John Llewellyn Lewis . <P> Thus was established what newly elected President Homer Martin called " a democratic , autonomous , clean union . " His inference was that the other part of the United Automobile Workers of America which in the recent split ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) remained with C. I. 0 . has none of these qualities , although it undoubtedly has a clear majority of organized autoworkers . <P> Homer Martin 's one chance of survival outside both C. I. 0 . and A. F. of L. is to sell his wobbly minority to automakers who , now that they must have some union , ask nothing more than an orderly one . For selling talk , Mr. Martin had his delegates pledge themselves to observe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debar all such gentry from office . In doing so Homer Martin alienated radicals who have stood loyally by him and supplied the bulk of his administrative brains . <P> Followers of Communist Oppositionist Jay Lovestone yelped that they had been sold out to the most reactionary elements in the union , threatened to desert en masse . Meantime Henry Ford 's unionized competitors resigned themselves to battle not with a union but between two unions claiming the same name , same contracts , same prerogatives under the Wagner Act .
