txt A study by local cotton-crop spenielists of prospective acreage and of current fertilizer sales in comparison with former years leads to the conclusion that so far as purchases of fertilizer are concerned , the South is not going in for unusually intensive cultivation of cotton in 1934 . This conclusion is reached in face of the fact that sales of fertilizer in the nine principal cotton-growing states for the four months ended March 31 , 1934 , indicated by tag sales , amounted to 1,946,000 tons , an increase of 72.4% over the 1,129,000 tons sold in the like period a year ago . The conclusion is based on a comparison with the average of sales in the fourmonth period from December to March in the five seasons from 1928 to 1932 , amounting to 2,540,000 tons . Sale of fertilizer in the four month period of the season 1933-1934 are 23.4% less than this five-year average . Selection of the five seasons from 1928 to 1932 as a basis for comparison is made because those are the seasons on which allotments of acreage for this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres to cotton on an average in these Ave seasons . Under voluntary agreements already signed by farmers , it is estimated that the 1934 acreage will show a reduction of 25% from this average . The Bankhead bill is designed to bring about conditions such that this estimate will be borne out . It seeks to keep farmers , not cooperating with the government under the voluntary plan , from planting a full acreage of old cotton land or from bringing new land into cultivation to cotton . It is possible that the cotton-farm family , with a reduced acreage , may have more time on its hands to do more hoeing and weeding and otherwise take better care of the crop , and to pick the last shred of fiber on the plants . But a reduction of fertilizer purchases so far this season of 23.4% of the five-year average is not far out of line with the reduction of 25% indicated for the acreage .
