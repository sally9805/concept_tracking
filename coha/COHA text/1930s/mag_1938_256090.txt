Aching hunger , rather than lack of munitions , has become Leftist Spain 's gravest problem . Leftists can point with pride that their troops have held their own for the last three months . Now Leftists are handicapped by this summer 's poor harvest , the cutting in two of Leftist territory , the feeding of 3,000,000 refugees who fled before Rightist advances , difficulties of transportation , ceaseless bombing , sinking of food ships bound for Leftist harbors . <P> It appeared last week that all these things combined have produced a food scarcity which , if not remedied , may very well force Leftist Spain to agree to a " Munich " mediation if not outright surrender . <P> For more than a year to each gnawing stomach of 900,000 Madrileos have been rationed only a few daily scraps of bread , a handful of rice , an occasional potato or orange , rancid olive oil , no sugar , mudlike coffee , little meat . Trees have been cut down , furniture broken up , destroyed houses and buildings whittled away to provide fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wintry blasts that sweep down from the Guadarrama Mountains . <P> In primarily industrial Catalonia , her population swollen with refugees , her few railroads and highways glutted with military supplies , the possibility of famine was so urgent last week that Barcelona 's press bureau sent cables to U. S. Leftist sympathizers appealing for food . Should France and England grant belligerent rights to Rightist Spain-an increasing probability-and thus enable Generalissimo Francisco Franco legally to blockade Leftist ports , little food from the outside could get to Leftist Spain . <P> Despite a press campaign against anything but unconditional victory , even in Rightist Spain there was growing talk of mediation . Few U. S. or British newsmen covering Rightist Spain have stood in the good graces of Generalissimo Franco 's avid blue-penciling censors for long . Notable exception is New York Times Correspondent William P. Carney , who has minimized Italian help to the Rightists , mentioned Moorish troops infrequently , reported denials of large-scale executions , called the Rightists " Nationalists " and described the Rightist reoccupation of Teruel seven weeks before that city was retaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to Gibraltar before he cabled that mediation was " debated on all sides from every angle " in Rightist Spain . <P> Calling reports of disaffection exaggerated , Mr. Carney left-handedly discussed Generalissimo Franco 's popularity , made the perplexing statement that the Generalissimo was more popular in the south , traditionally Leftist , than in the north , which used to vote Right . He failed to explain why . <P> Meanwhile , Barcelona lived through one of its most terrifying 24 hours , marked by six Rightist air raids . For the first time since the war 's start the city saw a priest in full vestments march through the streets , carrying a cross , followed by Foreign Minister Julio Alvarez del Vayo and General Jos Riquelme , among others . <P> Occasion was the funeral of popular Captain Vicente de Egua of the Militia , killed on the Ebro front .
