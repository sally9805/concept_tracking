Job of cinema producers is to produce cinemas . How to do so and at the same time deal with Hollywood 's screen writers , actors and technicians , whose organizational activities in the course of the last month have reached a record peak , has lately been cinema producers ' most pressing problem . Last week in Hollywood they found a solution : to represent them as labor arbitrator , the eight major companies included in the Producers Association ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Paramount , Warner Bros. , Twentieth Century-Fox , RKO , United Artists , Universal and Columbia ) elected Benjamin Bertram Kahane , for the last year right-hand man to Columbia 's President Harry Kohn . Bald , hook-nosed Ben Kahane , 45 , is a onetime Chicago lawyer who became general counsel for the old Orpheum Circuit , and got into cinema when the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation was formed in 1928 , worked up to become president of RKO Studios in Hollywood until a year ago . Promptly dubbed " producers ' tsar " by Hollywood 's trade press , his $75,000-a-year job of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor troubles will last for three years . <P> Tsar Kahane 's appointment coincided auspiciously last week with the conclusion of Hollywood 's most troublesome recent labor difficulties when , after six weeks of picketing and bickering , the strike of painters and scenic artists ( TIME , June 14 ) approached settlement . Pending final wage adjustments , the strikers last week returned to work .
