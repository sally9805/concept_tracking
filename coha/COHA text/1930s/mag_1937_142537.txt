In the somewhat banal white marble palace of the Pan-American Union in Washington last week gathered diplomats from 21 republics of the Western Hemisphere , to hear a somewhat banal Pan-American Day message from their Good Neighbor , Franklin Delano Roosevelt . Beaming " with faith in the high destiny of the Americas , " Good Neighbor Roosevelt spoke a smooth public piece in the style to which all Americans are now accustomed . When he had finished he unexpectedly dismissed the press , asked that the microphones before him be deadened , and in a suspenseful silence gave a confidential extempore talk which every delegate present was soon itching to get onto a cable . Particularly itchy was Cuba 's brand-new Ambassador Pedro Martnez Fraga , for the substance of Good Neighbor Roosevelt 's remarks was that he would under no circumstances be prevailed upon to intervene in the affairs of Cuba . <P> Day prior , Good Neighbor Roosevelt 's most obstreperous neighbor , Cuba 's Army Chief and Strong Man , Colonel Fulgencio Batista , had dramatically tightened his hold on the island which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camagey Province to his gleaming , refurbished Camp Columbia ten miles outside Havana , Boss Batista met his Capitol lieutenants to hear details of how the lower house of Cuba 's 16th Congress was staging a legislative " standup " strike in the corridors outside their chamber . For a full week they had refused to take their seats in number sufficient for a quorum . Unread on the lectern was the latest message which Dictator Batista had authorized his hand-picked President Federico Laredo Bru to read . <P> As soon as the Colonel 's lieutenants shuttled back from Camp Columbia to the Capitol , the stand-up was over . Back into the chamber filed 111 of the lower house 's 162 members , just enough for a quorum but not enough to let Boss Batista forget that they were aggrieved . What they then heard from President Laredo Bru would have burned the ears of any U. S. Congress . <P> The Government , thundered Camp Columbia through the mouth of Laredo Bru , was tired of keeping 162 Representatives and 36 Senators at a cost of $4,000,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the Senate obeyed the Colonel 's orders last December and impeached troublesome President Dr. Miguel Mariano Gmez , both houses had been feeling a new sense of power . They had refrained from legislating to argue over such matters as jobs . Now the Government , reported dutiful Seor Laredo Bru , was going to set things moving again by holding elections for its long-deferred Constituent Assembly which , among other acts , is supposed to write a new Cuban constitution .
