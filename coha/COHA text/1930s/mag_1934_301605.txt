During the French Revolution a memorable meeting of the Third Estate was held on a tennis court . In Chicago in the last six months two memorable meetings have been held in a gymnasium . The meeters have been the stockholders of Armour &; Co . Last week in the big brick building which the late J. Ogden Armour built to make strong Armour meatmen stronger , the stockholders completed the revolution they began last autumn . <P> When President Lee called the meeting to order last week he knew exactly what was going to happen . After his own reorganization plan had been blocked by stockholders ' committees ( TIME , Sept. 11 ) , he had been forced to consider the wishes of Frederick Henry Prince , 74-year-old Boston banker who had suddenly become one of Armour 's largest stockholders . Crusty Banker Prince and President Lee had agreed on a board of di rectors , and between them they held nearly two-thirds of the proxies . <P> Apart from other stockholders sat Chase Ulman of St. Louis with S. Mayner Wallace , his lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . Mr. Ulman had fought President Lee 's plans as bitterly as Banker Prince . Last week Mr. Ulman and Lawyer Wallace were added to the full Prince-Lee slate . While election tellers went through with the formality of counting the vote , a lawyer read a report from a stockholders ' committee . Up jumped Mr. Ulman to accuse him of being a paid attorney , not a stockholder . His speech of denial was drowned in " Boooos . " The stockholders then turned their attention to President Lee . They wanted to know all about salaries . President Lee promised to tell them individually if they would come to his office later . " Boooooo ! " howled the stockholders . Someone attacked the management . " Boooo ! Boooo ! " Someone defended the management . " Boooo ! Booo ! Booo ! " Finally one of the 250 stockholders yelled : " We want dough out of this company , not a lot of talk like this . " <P> Thirteen old Armour directors were re-elected and eight new men added to the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , Lawyer Weymouth Kirkland , James A. McDonough and Banker Prince . Two represented Mr. Ulman-Mr . Ulman and his lawyer . The election of the other two marked the reentry of the Armours into Armour &; Co . They were Lester Armour and his brother Philip Danforth III . <P> " P. D. " III was 37 and first vice president when Thomas George Lee was made president of Armour &; Co. in 1931 . Vice President Armour thought he deserved the topnotch job . When the directors offered him an impotent vice-chairmanship , " P. D. " III resigned in a huff . And for the first time since the Founding " P. D. " went to Chicago shortly after the Civil War , Armour had no Armour executives . Two second cousins of " P. D. " III and Lester stayed on as directors ( and were re-elected last week ) but the grandsons of " P. D. ' ' were out .                    @
