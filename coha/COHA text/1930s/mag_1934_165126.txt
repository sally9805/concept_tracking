A hot , tired young man boarded a Pullman in Washington one night last week , squeezed his lanky length into a berth , went quickly to sleep . Half hour later , as the train was clacking through Maryland , another man tiptoed down the aisle , parted the green baize curtains , popped a package of papers on the sleeper . The man in the berth rose up , seized what had struck him , hurled it at the intruder . The man in the aisle picked it up , tossed it back into the berth once more . Swish , the package came sailing out of the berth a second time . The other man retrieved it , laid it back on the Pullman passenger , walked away . <P> Next morning the nation learned that Secretary of Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace and a U. S. Deputy Marshal had been playing a midnight game of volley ball with a Federal court summons . In Baltimore a suit had been filed by Royal Farms Dairy questioning the constitutionality of AAA , naming Secretary Wallace a defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the process server had seized the opportunity of cornering the sleeping Secretary while he was rolling through Maryland on his way to Chautauqua . N. Y. to deliver an address . <P> At Chautauqua Secretary Wallace said he did not recall much about the affair . " I was too sleepy and tired to really know , " he said . " I was expecting some kind of nutty performance . "
