" They do things so funny in Cleveland . This whole thing is really terrific . " What made pert , red-headed Toto Leverne thus exclaim last week was the French Casino 's canvas top which one night leaked buckets of rain on her naked body , spoiled her swan dance . But for the 250,000 people who last week gaped at Dancer Leverne and other exhibits of Cleveland 's Great Lakes Exposition , her remark was the perfect tribute to a city 's spirited struggle to lift itself up &; out of Depression . <P> By 1934 Depression , plus a wave of strikes and racketeers , had brought Cleveland to its knees . First rally was organization by the Advertising Club of a <P> " Come-to-Cleveland " committee , which this year is bringing to the city no less than 176 conventions . Civic affairs got a distinct lift last November when Harold Hitz Burton , an able , vigorous Independent Republican backed by Cleveland 's three newspapers , was elected Mayor . Meantime , a little group of public-spirited citizens had been thinking that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good chance for some kind of municipal exhibitionism which would put Cleveland back into the national sunlight . Having had the inspiration , they turned for action to a onetime Clevelander named Lincoln Griffith Dickey . <P> Genial , hook-nosed " Linc " Dickey got his first training in showmanship by promoting itinerant Chautauquas and William Jennings Bryan . In 1922 Cleveland hired him to manage its huge Public Hall , scene of last month 's Republican Convention . So notable was his success that in 1928 Atlantic City lured him away with $25,000 per year to run its Auditorium . Five years later rich Manhattan got him for chief of its Convention &; Visitors Bureau . <P> Glad to get back to Cleveland to do some creative showmanship , " Linc " Dickey finished up his blueprints for a Great Lakes Exposition early last winter , laid them on the desk of Cleveland 's No. 1 philanthropist , Dudley Stuart Blossom . Enthusiastic Mr. Blossom promptly agreed to bear all development costs up to Jan. 1 . By the end of January contributions ranging from $25 to $50,000 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , General Manager Dickey , General Chairman Blossom and 125 trustees went into action . <P> The city contributed its $25,000,000 worth of halls and stadiums , its unsightly 150-acre dump sprawled along the lake front . Last March contractors began blasting away at frozen ashes , tin cans , bedsprings . In three months 15 miles of paving were laid , huge buildings erected . Exhibitors , paying $4 per sq . ft. for space , moved in their products . When last fortnight Secretary of Commerce Roper drawled a dull greeting into a microphone before a tiny audience , Cleveland suddenly woke up to find its dump converted into a thing of fun and beauty . <P> Pointing to Chicago 's Century of Progress , which was five years in the making , and to New York 's 1939 World 's Fair , for which ground was broken on the Flushing , L. I. , meadows last week , Clevelanders boasted that their Exposition had taken just So days to build , that every nail was in place for the opening . Supposedly the Exposition centered around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight Great Lakes States .
