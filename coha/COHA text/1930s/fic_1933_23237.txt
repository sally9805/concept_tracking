COCKTAIL PARTY A STORY BY JANET CURREN OWEN N EITHER the shadowy film of dust on the toile curtains nor the litter of toys on the floor could much detract from the original beauty of the room . There was loveliness of line in the curve of the open staircase , and the twin arches of the deep bookshelves rose purely over rows of colorful books . But disorderliness hung about the room ; it was acutely perceptible to Lucia because she had not yet forgotten the clear window panes , the shining silver , the well-brushed cushions , and the dandiacally precise attitudes of the little chairs and tables . Without at all taxing her imagination , she could see Hilda as she had stood over the piano , and a gesture with which the girl had run her cloth between the black and white keys was bright in her mind . She herself would never be able to achieve quite that air of perfection in any place . She turned her attention to the two little boys who had scratched up the thick nap of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she told herself that it was enough to have kept them both clean , amused , and  --  well fed . She had done well ; so long as their robust bodies were live and eager , what did it matter that actual sadness filled her because , before her eyes , her house grew daily more unlovely in disorder ? For a moment , watching the little boys , her thin face was pleased and interested , a cloudy preoccupation entirely erased from it . Then she became conscious of the strained taut feeling in her thighs , of the dead ache between her shoulderblades . She had been used to seeing her laundresses comfortably sitting at their ironing , but when she had come to do it herself she found she was too light and small . Hours of standing over the board and of throwing all her weight onto the heavy iron left her senseless with fatigue . Thoughtlessly she sighed aloud as she sank back into her chair with her legs stretched straight out before her . Immediately Clay looked up from his book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideward toward him , seeing in a flash how he was at ease in an old tweed coat and flannel trousers . She knew exactly how she meant to scream at him , " Tired , you idiot ! I 'm dying of tiredness . I tell you I ca n't ? " But her frown of hysterical irritation passed like a shadow before it had settled . She smiled mechanically and drew up her relaxed limbs . " Oh , a little , " she said . " But go out and look at the superb ironing I 've finished . Hung out on the clotheshorse , pure as ? Go along ; go and see . " He rose with an indulgent expression and strolled toward the kitchen . When he had disappeared Lucia hur-tied after him-to hang over his shoulder as he gazed with admiration . Her eye became critical as she tried to see with his perceptions . She darted round iu front of him and folded out of sight a small scorched spot . " Nothing , " she said . " It 's noth-ing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's this ! " he cried . " You 've scorched my shorts ? " He caught hold of her roughly ; they both began to laugh . Their laughing faded off into faint half-sighing sounds and finally silence as Lucia leaned her head on his shoulder while he supported almost entirely the weight of her slight body . He took from her the weight of her body ; tired , tired , she leaned against him . While her eyes were open she was able to see the upward-slanting line of his jaw and how his hair grew too low . The hair line , which should have been clean cut in a semicircle behind his ear , was overlapped with ragged darkness . Then her eyes closed and her fatigue dazzled her into unreality . She thought vaguely that if she could find the smallest pair of scissors she might carefully snip round his ear . . . . The voices of the children were very far away . Perhaps the nurse had them bathed and fed and in their beds . Perhaps in a moment Hilda would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit together at the freshly waxed table broken by sheer linen into squares and oblongs of dark and light . She opened her eyes and they fell on the table . It was dull , and bare of anything more than a pale flecking of dust . When it was time for the little boys ' suppers Clay took them upstairs and gave them their baths in the same water . " Why do I always have to have a bath with Johnnie ? " said the bigger boy furiously as the small boy dug strong toes into his bare back . " Because , " Clay patiently explained , " we do n't want to use more hot water than we must . Every time we turn on the hot water it makes the gadget in the cellar go , and every time that goes it costs money . We must spend as little as possible . " " ' Cause you 're home with us all the time ? " the bigger boy asked , looking wisely into his father 's serious face . " That 's it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucia said when they came downstairs in their clean pajamas . " Shame for what ? " " Shame for pestering Daddy , " she said indignantly . " I heard you ? ' She set on their table two identical bowls of cereal and two cups of milk . At an exact angle to the right of the bowls she methodically placed the dishes of prunes . Then she lighted the toaster and stood silently before it until it glowed warmly . " This kitchen is too enormous , " she told Clay . " A day in it is better than walking three times around the reservoir . " " Your health should improve , " he said gravely , tying Johnnie 's bib . " Exercise is so fine for you . " " Prunes , prunes , " the bigger boy chanted , viciously thrusting his spoon at one of the moist brown ovoids . " They 're pretty wrinkled . I guess they 're going to die pretty soon . " The little boy said immediately , " My prunes is so w'inkled they dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last word , tauntingly . Lucia glared at them over her shoulder as she cut the bread in thin slices . Her mouth turned up at its corners in amusement but she tried to pull it down in severity , so that the muscles quarreled with one another . The effect was a formidable expres-sion , and the little boys , seeing it , hastily stuffed spoonfuls of cereal into their round red mouths . Suddenly Clay cried in a loud whisper , " Good God , we 've guests ! " Lucia bent her head and followed his glance through the door and out the dining-room window . Her eyes fell swiftly to the old blue smock she wore . She had been used to wearing it at the hospital where she had folded white gauze into surgical dressings and directed visitors to the wards in order to accumulate points for her Junior League work , but in the last few months it had adapted itself to the more serious milieu of the laundry . In a dozen spots it was scarred with starch and soapy stains . Silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a despairing gesture , ran out of the room . Heroic leaps up the stairs and a dash down the hall , and she was able to close her door on a harmony of bass and treble voices which sought out all the quiet corners of the house . For a moment she stood irresolute , listening . Then she began rapidly to unbutton her smock . She stepped out of all her clothes and scrambled them into a handful which she threw into the hamper in her bathroom . On an impulse she was in and out of the shower before she had time to anticipate it . The cool water had turned her pale flesh blue . With a trembling hand and her face tipped close to the mirror , she painted crimson the wide thin mouth , dashed color high on her cheeks , and drew back the soft waves of her untended fair hair with alternate tender movements of the comb and her fingers . A wall of the room was solid with paneled mirrors . Lucia , with chilled fingers , slid one panel behind another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed to her cheek . She owned many lovely dresses ; theircolors were brilliant to her eyes as the world is dazzling after the confinement of a long illness , so that it was a relief to let her glance rest on the drabness of muslin slips covering evening gowns . She took down gold cr  --  pe pajamas . Her arm ached almost immediately because she held them high , out of reach of the dust she felt must coat the floor . When she was all ready , the ends of the jacket tied tight around her waist , she stood again before the mirror . A drop of amber perfume clung to the bottom of a big square bottle on her dressing table , and this she shook recklessly straight onto the crown of her head . A tiny bead of liquid was cool against her scalp where the hair was parted . The two boys came upstairs , and she put them into their beds , flipped blanket ends beneath the mattresses with a fine dexterity , pulled down shades , and closed doors . She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were there . She could n't begin to count them . They milled about in the living room and overflowed into the kitchen , cluttered with the debris from supper and filled with the fresh smell of her proud laundry . Their ears in the driveway were parked double and three deep , and the cocktail shakers they had brought stood tall and frosted on tables , and one of them made a pale aromatic circle on the shining wood of the piano . They cried to her that they had all been having cocktails at Allison Gill 's ; that they had had this brainstorm and come right along to share them with Clay and Lucia . Lucia smiled at them a little stiffly and said that it had indeed been a brainstorm . She added vaguely that there were probably crackers somewhere in the house . " Do n't move ! " Allison cried to her . " This is my party entirely . Ted has a whole box full of canapes and the olives are all ready , wrapped in bacon . " She took hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broiler this minute . " Then Lucia smelled the bacon and she began to feel a little better . She did n't ask where they were going afterward ; she could guess from past experiences that it would be either the country club or a sort of speakeasy on the road to Boston . It had never been anything tremendously exciting , but the fact that she was not going with them cast a glamour over their activities , and she thought wistfully of a whole lobster and little crisp rolls and a big gleaming tureen of creamed soup from which a waiter with a perpetual crick in his back would obsequiously ladle great spoonfuls . She accepted a cocktail from Stanley Clarke , whom she had once felt she knew very well . He told her that she was looking marvelous and that he had never seen the lawn and garden lovelier . Lucia knew he must have seen the For Sale sign which stood blatant in the center of the smooth green expanse ; she stopped herself from saying that Clay now had lots of time to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks she began desperately to want a cigarette . She had not had one for a month at least . That habit was gone ; she had dispensed with it . Nevertheless , she reached out and idly opened a small cloisonn ? box . Empty . Her eyebrows lifted in surprise . Stanley thrust before her an open leather case . There were exposed in it two long rows of perfect white cigarettes , and Lucia delightedly caught the faint scent of fresh tobacco . Her hand hesitated , hovered over the fine ovals . She looked about uncertainly and then with sudden firmness she selected one . " Yes , I will , thank you , " she said . Gratefully she drew the smoke into her lungs . Slowly , slowly , she relinquished it , allowing it to escape from between her lips in the smallest possible wisps and curls . When the radiant tip was so close that it scorched her month Stanley , smiling , took it from her fingers . He flipped open the leather case and again held it toward her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she greedily smoked any number of cigarettes of which there appeared to be a wanton profusion . She talked entirely coherently to Allison Gill about hospital work . Her eyes fixed on the open fronts of Allison 's sandals through which the toenails ruddily gleamed , Lucia heard her own voice saying , " He took a long time to die . It 's four months since I saw him in the hospital . I was sitting down , Allie , at the little desk in the hall , and there was a large bustling at the door and in he came in a wheel chair . All I can say is , he looked like death then . Afterwards I found his admission card and I saw that he had put himself down as a Presbyterian . I thought that was funny . Do n't you think that 's funny ? His being a Presbyterian with one kidney gone and his liver just rigid with alcohol ? " She was rather surprised at her facile conversation and she was glad when Stanley Clarke came back to her . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with him . In the intimacy of their embrace he gazed fondly down at her . " You ought to come out more , Lucia , " he said . " It 's bad of you to keep away from us. / miss you terribly . " His arm clasped her more closely and he added , " You 're so thin , little Lucy . " She was wondering how much electricity the radio would consume ; in-sanely she answered him . " Yes , I am . It 's the hard , hard bending over the wash tubs as does it , mister , combined with the light fare . " He held his body away from her and looked into her face , shocked and curious . But he said nothing , and when they reached the group they had left he released her . Soon afterward there was an exodus as concerted and rapid as had been the arrival . Clay closed the door gently and turned to look at her . She sat apathetically on the arm of a chair . She did n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room with her eyes . She began to walk about hurriedly , thrusting her hand , swift and greedy , into the seats of the chairs . Nothing . Angrily she chose a long butt from an overflowing ashtray . The flame of the match made a sizzling sound against an escaped strand of hair . She knew that the expression of pain and humility would be plain in Clay 's eyes , so she did not look at him . But it made her angry to know that it was there . She began to gather together all the small glasses left in unexpected places all over the room . Clay helped her ; they carried them out to the kitchen where she arranged them on the shining porcelain table beside the sink . Then she put a big apron over her pajamas and as she brought from the refrigerator the butter , two eggs , two tomatoes , and a bowl of lettuce she said in a hard voice , " Nothing like a few cocktails to restore the languishing appetite . " That phrase " languishing appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her laugh was as strained as the cry of a woman in labor . Suddenly she fixed on Clay her dark eyes , brilliant and febrilewith the stimulation of the drinks . " What do you say , " she began rapidly , " to a good cup of that chicken broth Hilda used to mix with cream of mushroom soup ? And little curled stems of celery and big ripe olives and crusty bread with slabs of sweet butter pressed against it And then , dear , " she continued in a cruel dreamy voice , " filet mignon a good three inches thick and the small tender hearts of artichokes shining in Hollandaise ? " Clay put his hand on her arm . It was a restraining gesture , and she saw that his eyes were frightened . He was afraid of what she might say , just as she was always afraid of what she might say . But something had momentarily pushed fear from her mind . " And perhaps endive with the chopped egg and Roquefort dressing . Here are the eggs  --  exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettuce , too . Of course , " she said , poking with a disdainful finger at the lettuce in the bowl , " one might say that this lettuce was just a trifle  --  er-desiccated ? " She saw Clay 's face from the corner of her eye . She saw him half turn as though to go out of the room , turn back , and with bent head cut the butter into two small pats which he balanced with a knife as he transferred them to bread-and-butter plates . His whole manner so enraged her that she crashed the bowl of lettuce onto the porcelain table . Half a dozen little glasses bounced into the air and smashed with a pretty musical sound . When he heard the wise of the breaking glass , he straightened and put his hand to his face . Lucia went to him . She pushed aside the butter and pulled herself onto the shelf . First she kissed Clay 's mouth and then she smoothed his head as it lay against her breast . " Never mind , my baby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
