txt Fourteen United States Treasury notes worth $590,000 disappeared Thursday from the United States Trust Company of New York , 45 Wall Street , under circumstances which convinced police that they had not been stolen . The police theory was that the loss was an accident . The notes , which were of the 27/8 per cent issue due June 15 , 1938 , were delivered at the securities cage of the trust company at 11:45 A. M. by two messengers . The clerk who received them placed them about two and a half feet from the wicket on the counter within the cage . There was a misunderstanding about what the messengers were to receive in return , and , while they waited . the clerk made inquiries of officials of the trust company and also talked by telephone with the First Boston Corporation , 100 Broadway , the office from which the notes had come . He was away from his window no more than ten minutes . When he returned the fourteen notes , which he had left clipped together on the counter , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of First District detectives , said that neither the police nor officials of the trust company had the slightest suspicion of any of the six men who were at work in the cage at the time . That disposed of the " inside job " theory . Captain Murray said also that it would have been impossible for a sneak thief outside the cage in the lobby to have reached the notes unless he " fished " for them through the barred wicket with a spear or a clip attached to a stick more than two feet long . " There were people around all the time , " Captain Murray explained , " and any thief trying to fish for them would have had a hard time . I 'm sure it could n't be done . " That disposed of the " outside job " theory . There was left only the hypothesis that the loss was accidental . Workers in the cage said they believed that several outgoing packages of securities had been dispatched during the time the $590,000 packet was lying on the counter . Police investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these packages in error . All deliveries will be checked to determine whether any one got the notes . The police were not called in on the case until twenty-four hours had elapsed . First , the insurers were notified . Because it seemed that the notes had been mislaid , searching parties covered every inch of the trust company office . The day 's waste paper had not yet gone to the baler , and it was sifted piece by piece . The search continued Thursday night . T. H. Wilson , vice president of the trust company , called in the police yesterday noon . Deputy Chief Inspector John J. Ryan went immediately to Wall Street from headquarters . He placed Lieutenant James F. Fitzpatrick of the First Squad in direct charge of the case , to which Detectives William F. Fay and Donald L. were assigned . The police questioned every one who had anything to do with the securities . The notes , which are of the " bearer " variety and which carry interest coupons due today , were delivered by Bernard Ferris , 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Himz , 45 , 10 Palmer Avenue , Port Richmond , S.

They passed the notes through the wicket to Ralph Longstreet , 30 , of 55 Hanson Place . Brooklyn . who turned them over to Fred Hilgeman. 27 , of 181 Clairmont Avenue , Westwood , N. J. Mr. Hilgeman had been instructed previously that a check was to be delivered to the messengers in return for the notes . Attached to them , however , was a " substitution slip " indicating that other securities were to be surrendered , It was while Mr. Hilgeman was straightening out this difficulty that the notes disappeared . During that period the two messer- , ers were waiting on a bench in the lobby . They saw only one person nrr the securities cage , and he was a messenger for the Federal Reserve Bank who had business there . Of the six men working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby from the wicket side . These were Longstreet , Hilgeman and Adam Batchellar of 1,072 Park Avenue . None of them told of seeing any person who aroused their suspicions . Five of the notes were worth $100,000 each and the others were for $10,000 each . The five bore the numbers 9607 , 9608 , 9609 , 9610 and 1402 . The police said the transaction was being carried out for a savings bank which is a customer of the trust company . The wicket through which the securities were passed was taken off by detectives , and over the space was pasted a piece of paper on which was written " Please use other window . " No fingerprints were found on the wicket . Police pointed out that if it was a theft case , the thief would have considerable difficulty disposing of the $100,000 notes because of their size . Officials of the trust company said that all the men working in the cage were employes of long standing .

There was no attempt to contend that any one aside from the trust company was responsible for them .
