Virtually certain to win a future Nobel Peace Prize award would be the statesman-conjurer who could persuade both sides of the 23-month-old Spanish Civil War to lay down their arms and peacefully mediate their differences . Last week Great Britain 's peace-talking Prime Minister , Neville Chamberlain , slyly let it be known through " authoritative " sources that he was considering waving a magic wand in that direction . <P> Mediator Chamberlain was represented as believing it possible : 1 ) that Fiihrer Adolf Hitler and II Duce Benito Mussolini would persuade Generalissimo Francisco Franco to talk matters over with his enemies ; 2 ) that French Premier Edouard Daladier could press Spanish Leftist Premier Juan Negrin to declare a truce ; 3 ) that Leftists and Rightists would agree to a government of Spain formed by " neutral " Spaniards in which Catalonia would remain autonomous . <P> To students of the British Prime Minister 's " realistic " policy , Mr. Chamberlain 's notions were something less than realistic . Neither Germany 's Hitler nor Italy 's Mussolini showed any interest in the plan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " neutral " Spaniards qualified to run the country . <P> Mildly irritating at times even to his loyal half-sister-in-law , Lady Austen Chamberlain , widow of the late Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Austen Chamberlain ( see cut ) , the Prime Minister 's mediation talk taxed the patience of Laborites and Liberals . The whole thing was probably best explained by United Press as a gesture designed to appease the rising ire of the British public and released to a pro-Government press for British consumption only .
