txt Premier Laval returned to Paris this afternoon to face three months of intense work if , following the conversations in Washington and the " understanding " said to have been reached there , anything of real value for the world is to result . The problem which he must face is how to restore confidence throughout the business and political world that Germany is or can be made solvent , and , second , that France has a real desire to restore her debtor to prosperity . M. Laval 's return today was very much of a personal triumph . He was received at Havre at noon and in Paris later with the applause of all parties and with that quick excitement of French crowds which disposes in a minute of all elaborate police precautions . With his daughter clinging to his arm , he had almost to fight his way out of the Gare St. Lazare , while the police were thrown aside by the crowd eager to see and to cheer the man who had held his own in America and . according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Borah to some kind of friendliness toward France and her desires by his ingratiating manner and his common sense . Confers With Doumer . The first visit the Premier paid was to President Doumer . With his closest colleagues in the Cabinet he had this afternoon long talks , but tomorrow the official work will begin in setting up that scheme of things whic:i was outlined or perhaps just hinted at as possible in the Washington communiqu ? . Tomorrow morning there will be a Cabinet meeting . In the afternoon , in the presence of Foreign Minister Briand , M. Laval will receive at his request the German Ambassador , Dr. Leopold von Hoesch , who will come ss a petitioner on behalf not only of Germany but of Germany 's private creditors . The nature of his petition is not yet known . It is said that he will ask for a great creditors ' meeting to be held at which there'will be a revision of the whole reparations question . It is recognized that in almost any event there must be at the beginning of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent as possible . however , it is demanded that the German Government must be compelled to stand behind the defaulters and take the responsibility for the situation of the country as a whole . It is only in that way , the French argue , that the real objective which was sought in Washington of restoration of confidence can be assured . World Bank Committee Suggested .. As to mechanism , nothing has yet been decided . It is suggested that a kind of re-enforced consultative Committee appointed by the World Bank might be set up , with the power not only to suggest but also to take some action in the control of German finance . There , again , one must , however , face the internal German position squarely and ask whether such a measure could be possible in a country where a large section at least of the population is definitely opposed to any foreign control , even if very distantly exercised . It is felt here that France can not remain alone in dealing with Germany . There are other creditors whose interests may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed Germany will make full use of this fact . At tomorrow 's Cabinet meeting it will probably be decided that Parliament shall be reconvened on Nov. 12 . That will mean that many days will have to be spent in explanation and discussion and in the formation of what it is hoped may be a new French opinion toward the whole problem . " It was all Laval . How hospitable and helpful the Americans are ! " was Mlle. Jose 's tribute . The Premier himself , who is always careful about his communications to the press , was content to repeat what he had already said in America and on the ship : " I am entirely satisfied with my journey and I have good hope that it will bring happy consequences . " Only one incident occurred in the excitement of M. Laval 's arrival in Paris . When the Premier 's automobile was leaving the station two young members of the so-called Fascist youth organization began shouting invectives ' against Aristide Briand . They were arrested but released after questioning . P. E. Flandin , Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques Bizot and Jacques Rueff , financial experts who accompanied M. Laval to Washington . Foreign Minister Briand , who was represented at the Qa.re St. Lazare this afternoon by his hef de cabinet , M. Leger , returned to Paris tonight from his country home at Cocherel and will attend the Council of Ministers tomorrow . He also , with M. Laval , will confer with the German Ambassador , who returned tonight from Berlin . " This preliminary meeting is not expected to go further than a mere exchange of information , " says Le Matin tonight . " Before submitting the different propositions that have been examined at Berlin the Reich wishes some light on the nature of the recent conversations at Washington , but if is easy to foresee the general lines of the plan of Chancellor Bruening . Says Reich Sees Waste of Time . " As concerns reparations , Germany believes it would be wasting time both for herself and for her creditors to have recourse to a consultative committee , as provided in the Young Plan , to determine anew Germany 's capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to meet without delay , especially as the Hoover moratorium has brought into consideration the unconditional payments in the Young annuities , while a consultative committee , if the letter of the Young Plan were followed , would not be called upon to pronounce upon the unconditional payments , which would be regarded as intangible .

" Calllaux Warns France . LE MANS , France , Nov. 2 UP ) . ? France was cautioned by Joseph Caillaux , former President and head of the war debt mission to the United States in 1925 , in a speech here today to exercise prudence in helping other countries solve their troubles .
