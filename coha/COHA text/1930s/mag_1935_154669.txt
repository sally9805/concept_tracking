A prideful lot were the nerve specialists who met in London last week for an International Neurological Congress . To them , the brain , cathedral of human intelligence , is no more than 2 lb. of raw meat , the cerebrospinal nervous system , conveyor of human will to muscles , a set of puppeteer 's strings ; the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems , a network of complex paths , lanes , byways and highways through which the human soul moves strangely . To know the complexities of the neural ways and cords and of the cerebral mass requires a chess player 's intricate mentality . To dare to touch them with a knife requires unpassionate fingers . <P> Such fingers has McGill University 's handsome Dr. Wilder Graves Penfield who told the International Neurological Congress how he opened the skulls of 75 epileptics , removed the scars and abscesses he found on their brains . A large number of the 75 were improved , remarked Dr. Penfield , and a few were cured . <P> From handsome Dr. Max Minor Peet of the Universityof Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidneys , adrenals , spleen , pancreas , liver , stomach and intestines , of cutting dorsal sympathetic nerves which affect the colon , rectum , bladder and genital organs . Dr. Peet operated thus on 60 patients to relieve their high blood pressure . Results : <P> 85% improvement , varying from the relief of headache to apparent complete cure ; 10% not benefited . About 15% seemed to be cured . " <P> Handsome Dr. Richard Max Brickner of Manhattan took out both frontal lobes of a man 's tumorous brain , a unique case , said he . Together with the excised pieces of his brain the patient lost his memory and , reported Dr. Brickner , " control over his emotional drives , presumably because he had lost the knowledge that there was a social gain in such control . In this respect , he was like a child who has not yet learned that there is a world in which it is necessary to meet people and situations and become adapted to them . " <P> The operations which Drs . Brickner , Peet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing emphasis among doctors . Where physicians can not cure with drugs , psychiatrists with suggestions , manipulators with physical therapy , surgeons with excisions , nerve specialists are daring to meddle by disconnecting parts of the body 's signal system . Along this line is the work of the Mayo Clinic 's handsome senior brain surgeon . Dr. Alfred Washington Adson . Dr. Adson told the London Congress the technique , which he worked out with a Mayo associate , Dr. George Elgie Brown , of stopping Raynaud 's Disease . This is a disease to which neurotic young women are peculiarly susceptible . After exposure to cold , shock or insult , their fingers or toes turn white , feel icy , grow numb , hurt . Attacks last from a few minutes to an hour . After many attacks the fingers or toes decay , may drop off . Sometimes the tip of the nose , the ears , parts of the lip rot away .
