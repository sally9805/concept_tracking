Fortnight ago San Francisco 's Golden Gate International Exposition suddenly announced that it would close on October 29-thirty-four days ahead of schedule . This decision was the more remarkable since the Exposition 's attendance was just reaching new highs for the year . But Exposition officials , foreseeing November rains , feared a late-fall attendance drop , decided there would be more profit in packing two months ' business into one . Last week they were getting ready to raze the topless towers of Treasure Island , to liquidate the Exposition that does not have to run a second year to save its face or its bondholders ( of whom it has none ) . <P> Different was the predicament of New York 's $157,000,000 World of Tomorrow . Three weeks from closing time , $436,670 of its current liabilities was owed to banks , $500,000 to contractors , another $500,000 immediately due to bondholders , and bills payable topped receivables by $500,000 . To meet these quick obligations it had $1,000,000 cash . In New York , as in San Francisco , October 's attendance is proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two weeks ) . It looked as if the Fair , by closing day , might just about pay off all but about $500,000 of its current debts . But the bald-faced fact was that no Fair official expected there would be a penny left to pay the outstanding $23,982,808 of the Fair 's original $27,000,000 bond issue . The World of Tomorrow had to last over till 1940 . <P> For that reason the impeccable Grover Aloysius Whalen last week tiptoed around the edges of the battlegrounds of Europe , drumming up trade for the 1940 edition of his World of Tomorrow . From Rome this sentimental journeyman reported : " Government officials are favorably inclined . " Elsewhere , he intimated , nations had received him most cordially . But so far he had no signatures on his pocketful of dotted lines . That was serious . For if a majority of this year 's 58 foreign exhibitors fail to renew their leases , the 1940 Fair will have to cope with a lot of blank spots where the handsome foreign pavilions now stand . <P> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Dow Gibson ( Fair board chairman &; potent Manufacturers Trust Co. president ) wooed U. S. exhibitors . To entice them in again next year he : <P> 1 ) slashed rentals almost 50% ( $14 to $7.50 a sq . ft. ) in Fair-owned buildings ; 2 ) cut ground rentals 10% for those who had built their own buildings ; 3 ) offered a 50% rent cut to all States exhibiting ; 4 ) advertised sites in the Fair 's Town of Tomorrow at a 30% markdown ; 5 ) abolished all charges for removing garbage . <P> First to snap up the bargain rates for Fair-owned buildings was big Metropolitan Life Insurance Co . General Electric , Ford , General Motors , Firestone , Carrier Corp . also signed up . By week 's end Florida was the only State to renew her contract ; Ohio the only one ( of 33 ) to say she would n't . <P> To Banker Gibson this was such good news that he loosed the floodgates . He ruled that for the remainder of the 1939 Fair ( except weekends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted without paying 25 admission . ( " Of course , " one of Banker Gibson 's assistants hastily added , " if the child has a beard , I think we can ask payment . " )
