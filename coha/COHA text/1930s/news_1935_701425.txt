txt Call for the Referee . The ethical standards of groups and individuals seems  --  for the present  --  to be much higher and finer than that of political organizations . For example , in the pugilistic field , heavyweights are matched with heavyweights , lightweights with lightweights . For a heavyweight to challenge a lightweight would be considered poor sportsmanship . Can not the same principle be applied to nations ? Should not the referee , the League of Nations , prevent a strong nation from attacking a weaker one ; or , failing that , come to the aid of the latter ? To offer as an excuse that other nations have done this sort of thing before is a poor alibi . This is the twentieth century . The League of Nations is a fact . So is the World Court and the Kellogg-Briand pact . B. D. JONES . New York , Sept. 1 , 1935.
