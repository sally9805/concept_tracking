" Our new models have been well accepted . There appears to be a greater interest than existed a year ago . This , is evidenced by the attendance at the showings of our new cars as well as by the number of retail orders actually received . " This leads us to the belief that the trend of consumer buying when retail deliveries of new cars can be made to customers in volume will be found to be substantially improved over that existing during the past few months . " Therefore , the corporation feels justified in increasing its current production schedules by revising upward the plans made last Summer , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher level of volume . And notwithstanding that the circumstances now available are indications as distinguished from facts , there being no real way of judging the depth of the better demand now manifesting itself .

" To assist in carrying on its stabilization of employment program , the corporation will again build substantial inventories in excess of retail demand during the Winter months , thus giving more hours of employment to the working force and at the same time preparing for the seasonal increase in business which occurs every Spring . " At present the number of General Motors employes is about 200 , - 000 , according to unofficial estimates .

A figurative " hooray " went up from official Washington today upon news that General Motors was re-employing 35,000 workers and rescinding some pay cuts . Administration economists , most of whom have regarded the motor industry as one of the key factors in the future of general business , were jubilant over the prospect for acceleration of the recovery from last Fall 's slump . " It makes the outlook even brighter than it has appeared , " said one who would not be quoted by name . " Probably it will stimulate business through the Fall , Winter and Spring . " It is also possible that General Motors 's action may lead some other companies to abandon plans for wage cuts . The outlook is perhaps for increasing wage rates generally .

DETROIT , Oct. ** learning that the General Motors Corporation was to rehire 35,000 men , Homer Martin , president of the United Automobile Workers of America , said : " It heartens me to learn that this many more men will be re-employed . I have no doubt the corporation is doing its best under poor market conditions to produce and sell as many cars as possible . " However , it still seems that the corporation will not find itself in a position to rehire all the men who worked in the various plants in 1937 . These men and their families will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any assurance that G. M. will be able to maintain its employment rolls for very many months . All estimates of the car production for this model indicate no more that 3,000,000 will be built . About 5,500,000 1937 models were produced . Since then there have been technological improvements further reducing the man-power required . " This rehiring of 35,000 mitigates the situation , but serious unemployment in the automobile and other industries remains . " In the automobile industry we need stabilization of employment rather than periodic hirings and lay-offs . No word of that has yet emanated from the corporations .
