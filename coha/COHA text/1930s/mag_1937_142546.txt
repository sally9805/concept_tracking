Babes In Arms ( music &; words by Richard Rodgers &; Lorenz Hart ; Dwight Deere Wiman , producer ) is a dewy and precocious musicomedy about a gang of youngsters who , abandoned by their vaudevillian parents for the summer , put on a revue to keep off the county farm . If for nothing else , the production is notable as a feat of theatrical cradle-robbing ; there is hardly a vote in the cast . <P> The two most talented babes of Babes In Arms are apparently not even eligible to operate a motor vehicle at night in New York State , where full driving privileges begin at 18 . One is Mitzi Green , a stripling advertised as 16 who used to be a child star in the films , progressed to a juvenile radio program which she surprisingly forsook this winter to entertain at a Manhattan night club called Versailles , a house where innocence is as rare as courtesy . There Miss Green did impersonations , the most painful of which-a re-enactment of Luise Rainer 's big sob scene in The Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her physical appearance but because of her propensity for rolling her eyes and giving the customers a continuous big square-mouthed smile , Miss Green is constantly , if unintentionally , in the throes of an imitation of Fanny Brice . Nevertheless , she is the spark plug of Babes In Arms . She dances a little , sings a lot : most charmingly a song called My Funny Valentine , most stridently a song called The Lady Is A Tramp . <P> The other moving spirit of Babes In Arms had no previous theatrical experience whatever , which is evidently something of an asset since most of her colleagues are professional youngsters inclined to make up with mugging what they lack in poise . She is Wynn Murray and hails from the church choirs of Scranton , Pa . Miss Murray is the Kate Smith type , weighs some 150 lb. and , well into Act I , is the first one to get Babes In Arms off the ground when , with a pleasantly sophisticated manner , she croons of her home Way Out West On West End Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> change , <P> I 'm ridin ' home to my kitchen range <P> Way out west on West End Avenue ! <P> Oh , I love to listen to the wagon wheels <P> That bring the milk that your neighbor <P> steals <P> Way out west on West End Avenue ! <P> Having participated in the most refreshing musical show of the previous season , On Your Toes , Messrs . Rodgers &; Hart were felicitated for having picked a novel notion this season for the first show they ever provided with a book as well as songs and lyrics . Lyricist Hart-never topped since he observed in 1925 that ' ' beans could get no keener reception in a beanery : bless our mountain greenery home ! " - still maintains the lightest touch in the business . As usual , the Rodgers melodies are fresh as a May wind , artful and surprising as the flight of a barn swallow . George Balanchine 's ballets , particularly a long dream dance , continue to set marks for more serious masters to shoot for .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
