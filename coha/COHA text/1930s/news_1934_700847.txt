txt Governor Lehman signed at Albany yesterday afternoon the papers for the extradition of Bruno Richard Hauptmann to New Jersey to stand trial for the murder of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr . The papers were brought here last night by an official messenger . In the Bronx Supreme Court this morning , James M. Fawcett , counsel for Hauptmann , will begin his legal fight to prevent extradition by suing for a writ of habeas corpus . This may force the New Jersey authorities to uncover their case against Hauptmann and the defense to disclose the alibi whereby it hopes to prove that the prisoner could not have been at Hopewell , N. J. , at the time of the kidnapping . Hauptmann is scheduled to go on trial in the Bronx County Court this morning on the charge of extorting $50,000 ransom from Colonel Lindbergh , but District Attorney Samuel J. Foley of the Bronx announced that he would ask an adjournment of this case for one week , to give the New Jersey authorities time to complete extradition . Cell Prepared in Flemington . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing their most secure cell for Hauptmann , and were planning to guard the county jail day and night against escape or attack . It was expected that the trial would begin soon after election early next month . A detail of seventeen New Jersey State troopers was held in readiness in the Bronx to escort Hauptmann to Flemington as soon as extradition was completed . It was revealed last night that the State of New Jersey has a new witness , who is expected to prove beyond a doubt that Hauptmann was in the ? vicinity of Hopewell on March I , 1932 , when the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped . The witness is Hartley B. Phillips , 17 years old , whose father , at the time of the kidnapping , owned a gasoline filling station on the New Brunswick-Hopewell Road . Young Phillips was not called upon to testify before the Hunterdon County grand jury that returned an indictment of murder against Hauptmann . The reason given yesterday by New Jersey police officials was that they had hoped to use him as a " surprise witness " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips 's story , about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of March 1 , 1932 , he was tending his father 's filling station when an automobile bearing New York license plates drove up . The gasoline tank , Phillips said , was almost empty . The driver of the car asked him to fill the tank and check the oil . Besides the driver , Phillips said , two other persons were in the car . One was a man several years younger than the driver ; the other was a veiled woman . What attracted his attention at the time , he said , was that the woman held a handkerchief before her face and seemed to be sobbing . Once , he said , she made a remark about wanting to turn back . But the driver of the car , speaking in broken English , assured her that everything would be all right . Finally , Phillips said , the driver got out with a road map in his hand and inquired the road to Hopewell The youth consulted the map and drew a line on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips added , got out of the car almost as soon as it had stopped and walked around nervously , stopping from time to time to examine one or another of the tires . When the gasoline tank had been filled , the car drove off in the direction of Hopewell . Although he often recalled the incident and wondered about it , Phillips said , he placed no especial significance upon it until after Hauptmann 's arrest . His father , who , since the kidnapping , has traded his gasoline station for a farm near Flemington , was reading an account of Hauptmann 's arrest when the son glanced at the paper and saw a picture of the suspect . instantly , he said , he recalled Hauptmann as the man who had been driving the car that day . Phillips was not sure of the make of the car , but the authorities say that his description of it fits Hauptmann 's car perfectly . Last Saturday the Flemington police took Phillips to Trenton , where he was questioned at length by Attorney General David T. Wilentz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seclusion at home until after Hauptmann is taken to New Jersey . Then Phillips will be taken to see Hauptmann . Action on Extradition . The extradition papers were signed in Trenton late Tuesday afternoon by Governor A. Harry Moore of New Jersey , and were handed to Governor Lehman at his home here that night by Attorney General Wilentz of New Jersey , in the presence of other New York and New Jersey officials . Governor Lehman carried them with him yesterday morning when he left Grand Central on the Empire State Express for Albany . Before leaving , the Governor told reporters that he had studied the papers Tuesday night , and intended to continue his study of them on the train . He said that he intended to follow the regular procedure , which would require a day to elapse between his receipt of the paper and the affixing of his signature . He would like to sign them as quickly as possible , be added , but in view of the seriousness of the case , he did not wish to be too hasty . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he came to .. lbany . A news reel representative tried to arrange for the Governor to pose while signing the papers , but the Governor replied that the case was too serious for that sort of thing . Mr. Fawcett traveled to Albany on the same train as the Governor , but they did not see each other on the trip . The Governor reached the Capitol at noon , followed shortly by Mr. Fawcett . Governor Lehman immediately went into conference on the case with Charles Poletti , his counsel . Soon afterward , Mr. Fawcett and the Governor 's counsel had an interview .

Mr. Fawcett started back to New York after his conference with the Governor . The defense lawyer announced that he would apply to Supreme Court Justice Ernest E. L. Hammer in the Bronx this morning for a writ of habeas corpus . " We are going to fight this case to the finish , " Mr. Fawcett said , He added that he bad not asked Governor Lehman to hold a hearing before signing the extradition papers . " The Governor told me that he was ready to grant the request of the New Jersey authorities , " said the lawyer . " I did not ask for a hearing because I preferred to carry the case to the courts . " Mr. Fawcett said last night that his application for the writ of habeas corpus would be based on the ground that Hauptman had not been properly identified in connection with the kidnapping or the resultant murder . He added that he expected the court to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence would be heard in detail lin the question of extradition . The lawyer explained that the writ , if obtained , would serve as a temporary stay to the extradition order . He added that Governor Lehman had assured him that there would be no attempt to remove Hauptmann from New York before he had time to apply for the writ of habeas corpus . The New Jersey officials left Albany about the same time as Mr. Fawcett . Governor Lehman signed the extradition papers in his Albany offices at 5 o'clock . Present were his secretary , Joseph J. Canavan ; Mr. Poletti and newspaper reporters and photographers . Before acting he made certain that no motion picture cameras were present . Papers Sent to Valentine . As he signed the papers Governor Lehman handed them to his secretary . When he finished he said , " I have signed them . " Later he said to reporters : " I am sending this requisMon by Arthur Corscadden , assistanexecu-. tive clerk , to Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine in New York . The papers authorize him to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , according to The Associated Press , ordered Commissioner Valentine to deliver Hauptmann. to Captain Lamb , as " duly authorized to receive him into his custody and convey him back to New Jersey . " It charged that Hauptmann was " a fugitive from justice and stands charged in that State with having committed therein , in the county of Hunterdon , the crime of murder . " It ordered the Police Commissioner to " arrest and secure the said fugitive wherever he may be found within the State . " Corscadden , the Governor 's messenger , left Albany on the Empire State Express last night for this city , with the extradition papers for delivery to Police Commissioner Valentine . The messenger arrived at Police Headquarters here with the extradition papers at 9:45 o'clock last night and handed them to Acting Inspector James F. , in command there at the time . Acting for Commissioner Valentine , Inspector took the papers to Bronx police headquarters and turned them over at 11:30 o'clock last night to Deputy Chief Inspector Henry E. Bruckman , in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed by Mr. Fawcett , was present and reported to the latter by telephone . Inspector Bruckman asserted that there was no " trick " contemplated and that no effort would be made to take Hauptmann to New Jersey during the night . The inspector subsequently got in touch with District Attorney Foley and was told to deliver the papers today . Officials in Albany , New York and Trenton united last night in saying that there was no possibility of an attempt being made to transfer Hauptnaann. to New Jersey during the night . It was pointed out that Hauptmann is under $100,000 bond in the extortion case in the Bronx , and that this bond must be vacated and Hauptmann placed on parole by court order before he can be released from the Bronx County jail . It was also noted that when an extradition warrant is served upon a prisoner , the law requires that he be notified that he can get a writ of habeas corpus . Probable Procedure Today . In Bronx official circles , It was said that the procedure this morning probably would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James M. Barrett at about 10 o'clock , when the extortion case is called for trial . The case will be adjourned at District Attorney Foley 's request . If Hauptmann 's attorney obtains a writ of habeas corpus , the prisoner will not immediately be returned to jail , but will be taken before Justice Hammer , presiding in Part I of the Supreme Court in the Bronx , for the hearing of arguments on the writ . It is customary for the court to announce its decision in a habeas corpus proceeding from the bench after the arguments are concluded . If the court decides to permit extradition , Hauptmann may be taken to New Jersey forthwith , unless Mr. Fawcett files notice of appeal end receives an adjournment . District Attorney Foley pointed out that even though Hauptman is paroled and his bond vacated in the extortion case the extortion indictment itself will be held in abeyance , so that if he escapes conviction in New Jersey he can be brought back to the Bronx to stand trial for extortion . Attorney General Wilentz announced that he expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney Foley moves for adjournment this morning . He said that when Hauptmann is taken to New Jersey he will be lodged in the Hunterdon County jail and arraigned the following day before Supreme Court Justice Thomas W. Trenchard in Flemington . No bail is allowed in New Jersey on a murder charge . Raising the question of how Hauptman could afford to make a legal " fight to the end " such as Mr. Fawcett has announced , New Jersey authorities at Trenton last night disclosed that all the prisoner 's known assets have been impounded , except for $1,000 which has been set aside for his wife 's use . The New Jersey officials estimated that it was costing the defense at least $300 a day for fifteen private detectives said to be working on the case . The defense also has engaged handwriting and fingerprint experts . Besides counsel fees in New York , it was said , Hauptmann will have to retain a trial lawyer in New Jersey . Captain Lamb , in his affidavit attached to the extradition papers , asserted he had information that Hauptmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Schwarzkopf , asked to reveal on what testimony this statement was based , replied : " I can , but I wo n't tell you . " Asked if Betty Gow , former nurse to the Lindbergh baby , had been requested to return to New Jersey to testify at the prospective trial of Hautpmann , the State police head said she had not yet been requested to do so and he did not know whether such a request would be made .
