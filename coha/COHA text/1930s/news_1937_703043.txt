txt Preliminary information on the retail distribution of 1938 model automobiles indicates that General Motors Corp . thus far has made decisively the best sales showing of any of the major car producers in comparison with the initial selling period for 1937 models . Circumstances also indicate that Chevrolet , the corporation 's most important producing division . may again take first rank among individual makes for unit sales volume in 1937. despite the serious inroads in its volume of business from strike tie-ups early in the year . This would be largely a result of Ford 's extended delay in developing volume production of its 1938 models this fall . On the basis of incomplete data covering total retail sales in November , the first full month in which the 1938 models were on the market , about one out of every two new passenger cars sold was a General Motors product . In November , 1936 , as well as in December of last year , the corporation accounted for about 44% of the domestic passenger car market For the 1937 model season as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 40% November Sales Off In actual unit volume of sales , General Motors ' retail business in November was . of course , considerably less than in the like 1936 month in conformity with the smaller total demand now available . Furthermore . a 50% share of the market undoubtedly is higher than the corporation will be able to maintain . In November of both 1936 and 1937 , the Ford Motor Co. load insufficient dealers ' stocks of new models to attain its usual share of the total business . Nevertheless , the General Motors ' showing was substantially better than that of the balance of the industry . With two exceptions , the products of ev= ? 5y other major passenger car manufacturer apparently obtained a smaller share of the total market than in November . 1936 , the preliminary data indicates . These two exceptions are Nash and Willys-Overland , the latter not having been actively in the market ill November , 1936 . On the other hand , every division of General Motors expanded its share of the total retail market in comparison with November of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend for the corporation continues  --  allowing for considerable downward adjustment of its unusually high November share of the total as the Ford resumes its full trade position  --  General Motors is likely to show a much more favorable comparison with 1937 levels in its first quarter retail sales than will the balance of the industry . This is assuming , of course , that there is no recurrence of serious labor difficulties this winter The strike tie-ups in General Motors plants last January and February , which sharply curtailed the movement of cars to dealers during those months , caused a decline to about 3354 , in the corporation 's share of the retail market in the first quarter of last year . These strike tie-ups and the subsequent sporadic interruptions during the second quarter , bore most heavily on Chevrolet and seriously impeded that division 's volume of deliveries during the peak selling months . As a result . Ford consistently outsold Chevrolet during the first half of the year . By the end of July . Ford 's lead , as measured by new vehicle registrations , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units in car and truck sales combined Sales Leadership Regained During the next three months . Chevrolet regained monthly sales leadership and by the end of October had reduced Ford 's lead to about 57,000 in passenger cars and about 69,000 in cars and trucks combined . In November , with Ford producing only a nominal quantity of its 1938 models and with Chevrolet operating actively and having an ample supply of new cars in the field , Ford 's margin was sharply reduced . By the end of the month , it is likely that Ford 's cumulative sales lead for 1937 was probably only about 9,000 or 10.000 units in domestic passenger car sales and about 18,000 In car and truck sales combined . Whether Chevrolet will be able to close this final gapuring December depends in large part upo the rapidity with which Ford 's expanded production this month moves into the hands of conaumera . Ford 's output has been in excess of 20,000 cars and trucks for the past two months and it is expected to maintain this rate for the balance of December In 1936 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 24% or 182,000 units in passenger cars and of about 23% or about 209 , - 000 units in cars and trucks . In 1935 , Ford outsold Chevrolet by a substantial margin but in the preceding years since 1931 Chevrolet held the lead .
