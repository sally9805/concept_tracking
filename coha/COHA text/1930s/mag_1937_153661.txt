Many a gallon of blue blood coursed through the veins of a snooty party delicately sipping tea one afternoon last week on the trim lawns of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes . Here and there a peer , dangling a strawberry , gazed into the middle distance for a patch of white canvas against the blue of The Solent . In full swing was the Squadron 's regatta . <P> The atmosphere of the R. Y. S. is more nearly that of a cathedral than of a club . Founded in 1815 by London yachtsmen " to promote seamanship and the improvement of sailing vessels , " it has 250 members ( including 19 women ) who cheerfully pay 100 guineas entrance fee , 100 guineas a year , has headquarters in a turreted fortress built by Henry VIII , later used as a state prison . Rigidly hostile to " trade , " the Squadron refused to admit the late Sir Thomas Lipton ( tea ) even though he had been proposed at the request of King Edward VII , had spent a fortune trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee , King Edward reputedly summoned the Commodore , asked : " Ca n't it be done ? " Replied the Commodore : " It can , Sire , * but if it is , the R. Y. S. will have but two members-yourself and Sir Thomas . " <P> Year ago this citadel of British aristocracy was shaken when an " unprincipled young bounder " from Cambridge University hoisted atop the Squadron 's masthead a pair of frilly , pink panties . <P> Last week Squadron members received a second shattering blow . Serene and blonde Viscountess Hinchingbrooke , wife of a onetime secretary of Earl Baldwin , went tripping across the sacred lawn in bright blue linen trousers . Nothing so blasphemous had happened since the day few years before when a shameless hussy appeared without stockings . Horrified , popping eyes were turned upon the Viscountess who blandly sat down , ordered tea . Next day the Squadron Committee met to discuss the crisis , decided to authorize the gatekeeper to turn back in future any woman so dressed . To newshawks Lord Hinchingbrooke expressed himself laconically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . . . Private matter . So what the Hell ? " <P> <P> * Unlike Sir Thomas Lipton , Aircraft Magnate T. O. M. Sopwith , whose Endeavour II last week straggled valiantly in the wake of Harold Vanderbilt 's Ranger ( see p. 25 ) , is not " first generation , " is therefore a member in good standing .
