Because Philadelphia had not paid $303,000 of their 1937 bills , two coal companies last week threatened to deliver no more coal to the city 's water works . Director Wilhelm F. Knauer of the Department of Supplies &; Purchases warned the City Council : " We ca n't let a city of 2,000,000 go without water . . . .
