NEARLY a dozen cups of coffee have flowed over the breakfast table since the World 's demise , and we find we miss it . It had come to be a kind of town gazette . During a period when most papers preferred the comfortable mediocrity of an impersonal viewpoint , the World continued to support personal journalism and a highly opinionated staff of writers  --  a nose-thumbing , posy-throwing , book-reading , playgoing , cantankerous group , the very color of whose neckties was known to every reader . Five or six years ago that loudly critical and essentially autobiographical page called " the page opposite the editorial page " reached a high peak of robustinus fame that made it unique in newspaperdom . However remote it was from news reporting , certainly there was nothing like it anywhere , certainly it gave one some excuse for getting out of bed in the morning . On days when the sheer dullness of the previous day 's news left other papers high and dry , the World often was at its most blooming  --  with Martha Hepplethwaite hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night 's show being torn limb from limb by Mr. Woollcott 's bare teeth , with a slim concert made understandable and amusing by Deems Taylor 's graceful pen , with a detailed statement of Mr. Broun 's household dilemmas of the day before , with a new Horace ode from the painstakingly flawless and darkly grammatical Mr. Adams . Perhaps the persons to whom the daily arrival of the morning World meant most were the exiles  --  people temporarily or permanently doomed tobe away from their beloved city . There were always a lot of these adherents scattered around the country ; and to them , in barbershops and boarding houses , in commercial-hotel lobbies and in city-rooms of small-town newspapers , the World was the bright moment of their twenty-four-hour day . It was a letter from home , In the doings of its colony of writers , whose personal habits were almost as familiar to readers as their names , was written the romance of metropolitan existence , plus the glamour that most people associate with being a newspaperman . The World had collected a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wrote almost continuously about themselves . That particular brand of autobiography would have frightened or bored most publishers , and it drew a sharp line between the World and such magnificently solvent organs as the Times . Imagine the Times chronicling the fact that one of its reporters had won twenty dollars yesterday playing kelly pool with a friend I Maybe that 's why the Times is where it is today , and the World where it is ; but the fact is , as we said before , we miss the World . In his last " Conning Tower " column , F.P.A. wrote : " Nobody , in short , ever ordered anything to be printed or omitted . " That degree of freedom is an unusual state of affairs  --  take it from anybody who ever worked on a paper . The same privilege extended to all the writers , and not infrequently one would find Mr. Braun , on Page 13 , briskly knocking the props out from under something that an editorial writer , over on Page 12 , had diligently built up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , though . It gave to life , in some inexplicable way , a continuity  --  a subtle feeling of progression . Mr. Adams ' interminable and unsuccessful campaign for visible house numbers , his perennial lamentation over dry sweeping , dull as they were , provided the sustained and pleasant illusion of life 's going on . It did n't matter whether one cared anything about these matters : merely reading about them created an enjoyable bond between people at thousands of breakfast tables . Lovers , despairing of a more private expression of adoration , used to pour out their hearts in a " Conning Tower " poem , safe in the knowledge that it would not be published if it were bad , confident that it would be carefully proofread , and pretty sure that it would be seen by the right party next morn-ing . Friends who seldom saw or wrote to each other kept in touch , now and then , through their contributions to the World . It was a community organ , and it was a pretty good newspaper , too . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , sometimes there were n't . No paper was more articulate , editorially . Lately the World had grown a bit creaky ; some of its best writers had gone , some of its best reporters did n't seem to he attending the right murders ; yet people stuck to it , if only for old times ' sake . We 've heard a lot of grousing about the World lately , but we never heard of anyone cancelling a subscription . There was something about it that made it impossible to abandon . Maybe it was that amazing daily paragraph by J. Otis Swift called " News Outside the Door , " which always , to the best of our recollection , began with the same sentence : " Along the meadow brook where golden willows are a yellow cloud of glory un warm February mornings ... " We never quite followed those paragraphs about nuthatches and periwinkles , but it was nice to read them . It was nice to know where Mr. Pepys dined on Tuesday , and to know on Thursday he was early up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a firm which sells some automobile accessory was reporting to the home office in New York about his business . It was pretty good , it seemed . " I know maybe the rest of the boys will want to hear about this , " he concluded , " but to avoid duplicity I am writing only to you , knowing you will probably pass the news along . " Word got about all right . The letter was mimeographed , without change , and forwarded to the forty other branch managers of the firm . Mishap COMPLETION of the mooring 1 -- - ) mast of the Empire State Building will be delayed for a month or more because an office-boy poked a chemist in the hack . That 's how involved life has got . Here is what happened : A firm in Greenpoint has been makbig the metal buttresses and sheathing for the tower , and it has n't been much fun . They 've had the devil 's own time getting the right finish to use . The laboratory at the factory has been open day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the right combination for the finish one night a couple of weeks ago , and the first shipment of metal was to have been made the neat day , hut , alas , came misadventure : Toward midnight the chemists  --  there were two of them working that night  --  sent an office-boy out to a corner restaurant for coffee and sandwiches . On his way back the boy picked up a stick to play with and when he returned to the laboratory he crept up behind one of the chemists who was standing engrossed over a crucible and Bunsen burner , and poked him in the back with the stick . The poked chemist jumped and knocked over the burner , crucible , metal finish , and all , and in a few moments the whole laboratory was burning beautifully . Most of the sheathing was so badly scorched that they will have to work it over . The manufacturer did his best . He bought out a concern similar to his own the day after the fire , moved over there , and started to work again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then his mother phoned and asked if her son could have his job back when he was cured of the burns he suffered in the fire . The boss said the job would be waiting for him . Raskob , Smith , et al. , arc waiting too . Getting On ONE evening last week a doctor pulled up near the Academy of Medicine , in 103rd Street , and fell to talking to the youth there who is in the habit of gleaning a dime tip from him by assuming responsibility for his car while he is inside attending meetings . He found out that trade was flourishing with the lad  --  he has saved up nineteen dollars ; further , when he grew up he was going to go to college and be a doctor too . " Well , " said the physician , " some day you 'll be driving Lip here and leaving your own car and some kid will come up and want to watch it , eh ? What 'll you do then ?

The mongoose , just a baby , had made a nice pet fur a while , but gradually it took to disappearing under things , and not coming out . This got on its owner 's nerves , and the Zoo got the mongoose . In order to own a mongoose it is necessary to get permission from the government . Even Dr. Ditmars , the Zoo 's snake man , had to go through the usual formality . Mongooses are so quick on their feet that they can kill almost any small creature they feel like killing  --  birds , rats , mice , baby chicks , snakes . If they were allowed to multiply in the land , the slaughter would he great : that 's why the government bans them . When a mongoose fights with a cobra , its ancient enemy , it places itself tantalizingly within the snake 's range , then hops back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neat trick , and it tires the snake out . The more tired the snake gets , the closer the mongoose approaches , until suddenly he grabs the snake by the back of the neck and hangs on . After a certain amount of writhing the snake gives up and dies . There are only three mongooses in the United States , we understand . The other two are in the St. Louis Zoo . We do n't see why all three of them should n't he given the run of Riker 's Island to kill the rats . It would make a great movie . 0 . Henry Reversed ONE of the newer New LJ York clubs has been making a big-scale membership drive and a young lady engaged for the emergency has been pretty busy . In eight weeks , for instance , she sent out nine thousand letters to prospective members , signing the name of Mr. James B. Cauthers , the president of the club , to each of them .

" Tex and Ella ONLY one of the Wendel sisters is left : Miss Ella , who is eighty-one years old . Shr owns about a hundred million dollars ' worth of New York real estate and lives alone in that silent , mournful old residence at Thirty-ninth and Fifth Avenue  --  the Wendel house . For years the three Wendel sisters lived there , mice-like , working a miracle of solitude in the heart of the city 's traffic and trade . The death of Miss Georgians in 1929 left Miss Ella all alone . One supposed the old house would he more mysterious than ever , that the world would never see the one old lady stirring outside it . Certainly nobody would have dreamed that Miss Ella would one night step out and visit , of all places , Texas Guinan 's night club . Take a firm grip on your chair arm while we tell you that this , however , is exactly what , one night , she did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Guinan writes a column for the Graphic and a few weeks ago she printed in it an open letter addressed to Miss Ella Wendel , addressed , indeed , informally , just to " Dear Ella . " It was a cheerful , impudent , teasing letter . Miss Guinan asked Ella why she did n't have a telephone put in , why she did n't try out the new invention , the electric light , why she did n't come on up to her night club some night and have a good time  --  chatter like that . A day or two after the column was printed an old gentleman who looked as if he had stepped out of the eighteen-eighties , as indeed he probably had , appeared at the night club . He announced himself as Miss 1 . N/enders at torney . At this point you could , of course , have knocked Miss Guinan down with a quill pen , she was so astonished  --  and frightened . She thought she was going to be sued for libel . The old gentleman from out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter and had decided to accept the invitation . Personally he deprecated the whole affair , had tried to dissuade her , but she had made up her mind and that was that . He felt it incumbent upon him to convey to Miss  --  ah  --  Guinan her acceptance . Miss Guinan managed to keep ahold of herself and said she was very happy . A date for Miss Wendel 's appearance was then set . On the great night Miss Wendel appeared , accompanied by her emissary , another old gentleman , and another old lady . All were over eighty . Miss Wendel wore a sable coat and a diamond hair ornament . They arrived at nine-thirty but Miss Guinan and her troupe happened to be on hand then as they were making a radio broadcast . The four old people sat through this , deeply interested , and they remained on for the regular show later . It was two A.m. before they bowed their way out of the uproar . Miss Wendel was interested in everything that went on . Miss Guinan sat at her table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tex " and " Ella . " They had a nice chat . In the course of this , Miss Guinan mentioned that she was upset because earlier in the day she had lost a valuable handbag , a present from Larry Fay  --  whom , we must suppose , Miss Wend el could not place . Ella listened sympathetically , however , and asked what sort of a bag it was . Tex told her in detail . About a week later Miss Guinan received a package  --  from Ella  --  containing a tittle gift . It was a handbag as George Kaufman , the co-author , who plays in it , does n't appear until the second act and sometimes he hangs furtively around the back of the auditorium during the first act , eavesdropping . He says he has n't yet heard one favorable remark about the show , and one recent experience was particularly distressing . He saw Mr. George M. Cohan sitting in an aisle seat toward the rear of the auditorium and set himself to watch his fellow-playwright 's face . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was able to edge up pretty close to Mr. Cohan , but toward the end of the act he got what he considers a positive reaction . Mr. Cohan got up , started up the aisle , accosted Mr. Kaufman , and said ; " Can you tell me where the smoking-room is ? " Buzz Buzz Pause WE dialled a number the other day and got what we instinctively knew was the raspberry  --  a buzz that was neither the busy buzz nor the ringing buzz nor the complete-disintegration buzz . It went like this : buzz buzz pause buzz buzz . We looked into it right away and learned that we were getting the V.C.T. ( Vacant Code Tone ) , the latest wrinkle of the Telephone Company . Only a few exchanges are equipped to give you the buzz buzz pause buzz hoar , but it is the coming thing : it tells you that you have dialled and lost . If you meant to dial BR 9 and accidentaly dialled BR 8 ( an exchange that does n't exist ) you would get the V.C.T. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " The old system was " What number did you call , pleeuz ? " That was complex and lengthy ; the V.C.T. saves the Company both time and money . Three exchanges in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn have it , so far . In a year all will have it . There 's a paragraph about it in the directory , Page 13 , called " Signals for which to listen , " and if you want to hear it , just out of curiosity , dial WO rth 5-1234 . That 's the Company 's test call for the V.C.T. Did you know , by the way , that the Company deliberately endowed forty-five of their one hundred and ninety-three exchanges with numerals in holes other than the holt occupied by the third letter of the exchange ? It was a deliberate move , made for the purpose of finding out how dumb or how bright the subscribers were , or how well disciplined . As dirty a trick as we ever heard of ; yet officials say it was the only way they had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system . Incidentally , people are catching on pretty quick . The Company is supremely happy at the way things are going . They wo n't have to think up a new exchange for fifty years . It 's marvellous to lean back in one 's chair and draw a free breath . Nostalgia IN meat-packing circles the name Schmidt ( we will disguise it as that ) is a big name . Mr. Schmidt is one of New York 's celebrated sausage-makers . We know a little story about his wife , Mrs. Schmidt  --  a magnificently ample and good lady who used to preside over the cashier 's cage of Schmidt 's butcher-shop in the humble days . All through her husband 's meteoric career she has been a busy woman and a helpmeet . The other day a lady who , as a little girl , had known the Mrs. Schmidt of the butchershop , saw , after all these years , the Mrs. Schmidt of sausage fame . She saw her in a Brooklyn graveyard , standing beside the Schmidt mausoleum a gleaming temple of Carrara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drawn up behind her was the Schmidt motorcar , its liveried chauffeur waiting patiently in the driver 's scat for Mrs. Schmidt , who was applying Bon Ami to the windows of her mausoleum , with all the gusto and absorption of a newly married Hau5-frau . Commodore THIRTY-FOUR years ago A. B. ( " Rescue " ) Randall sailed around the Horn and around the world on a smallish craft commanded by his cousin . The ship was gone a year . Randall 's mother had the idea that the trip would cure her son , then seventeen , of his hankering to he a sailor , but she was wrong : it made him want to he a sailor and he 's been on the sea ever since . In January he was put in charge of the Leviathan , as Commodore of the United States Lines , succeeding Commodore Cunningham , who resigned because he wanted to spend more time on land . Randall does n't like to spend any time on land . On shore there 's no routine or discipline , and the taxicabs drive him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new commodore keeps his cabin windows tightly closed at night . He gets plenty of fresh air , however , in fogs and storms ; on several occasions he has n't taken his clothes off for six days and nights and in bad weather he 's gone as long as sixty hours without sleep . Captain Randall got his nickname , " Rescue , " in the early nineteen-twenties . In January of 1920 he transferred two hundred and seventy-four passengers from the Powhatan , which he cornmended , to another ship , and then brought the floundering Powhatan into port safely at Halifax . Two years later , shortly after he went into the merchant marine , he rescued six men from the schooner Reinc Demers , which was disabled at sea . About a year after that , as skipper of the President Fillmore , he rescued six more men from the troubled schooner Rita M. Cluet . Two more years went by and in violent October weather off Nantucket he rescued the crew of eight men from a Coast Guard cutter that had been blown helpless out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships in distress have , as you know , usually veered in the direction of Captain Fried , instead of Randall . Randall is an amiable gentleman , short and stocky , with a niddy face and graying hair . He likes to dance and to joke with people . He will ask you what Hoboken has that New York ca n't boast of , and after you 've tried to guess , he 'll say " The other end of the Hudson Tubes , " and laugh heartily . When ashore he lives at Beechhurst , near Flushing . After each trip he has from two to five days ashore , and every year a six-week period for the annual overhaul , during which time , however , he visits his ship every day to see how things are coming along . His hobby is stamp-collecting . On land he bundles up carefully and always wears overshoes and carries an umbrella when it is damp underfoot or threatening overhead . He never wears his uniform off the ship because , he says , it makes him look like a bandmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm was naturally pretty flustered toward the end of a day spent with movers transporting his furniture From one set of offices to another and his irascibility was probably excusable during the struggle to get a large , heavy , antique table out through the door of the committee-room . All the moving men were attacking it , all save one who leaned against the wall watching with interest and , one might suspect , mild enjoyment . " Why do n't you give a hand ? " demanded the engineer . The mover just looked tolerant . " I 'm a metal mall , " he explained .
