txt BUFFALO , May ** tax rate of the city of Buffalo for the fiscal year 1933-34 will be the lowest that has been levied since 1909-10 . The actual figure is $20.47 per $1,000 of valuation . Rates in other recent years have been : 1932-33 , $23,62 ; 1931-32 , $27.94 ; 1930-31 , $29.40 ; 1929-30 , $29.40 , and 1928-29 , $26.30 . The total appropriations in the latter year were $45,595,000 . The average for the last five years has been $44,217,000 . The appropriations for 1933-34 are $38,980,418 . The total amount to be raised by direct tax on property is more than 30 per cent below the sum levied in 1930-31 , when the city was under an administration holdin ? over from the commission plan of government . Moreover , this new tax rate is to be spread upon reduced assessments . In recognition of the general depression , valuations for purposes of taxation were cut down by $87,000,000 in Buffalo this year ? the first reduction of assessments in thirty-two years . This reduction in expenditures may be credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roesch , but it also affords an instructive illustration of the operation of Buffalo 's present charter , which was adopted in 1927 and includes a budget system quite unusual in American municipalities . The feature of the plan which is most influential in promoting economy is that the executive and legislative branches become checks upon each other . Either may reduce the other 's appropriations independently , but increases can be made only by cooperation . Such a provision may count for little when both are under a common political control , but when they are divided in party allegiance and ambitions , the system is subjected to a test which makes the taxpayer chuckle . Work Begins With Mayor . Briefly , the process of budgetmaking begins with the submission by the different departments of their estimates of the amount of money which they think they will need . These must be in the hands of the Mayor by Feb. 1 of each year . The Mayor and his budget director then have six weeks to consider the requests , hold hearings , revise and readjust . Under all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , the departments asked for amounts totaling $45,140,828 . The budget which the Mayor submitted to the Council allowed them $38,967,131 . Not till after this report on March 15 did the Council begin to take part in the framing of the budget . The Council does not come into original contact with the department heads when they are presenting their requests , but it hears them , if at all , only after the Mayor has decided on their claims . The Council then may strike out or reduce any item in the budget , sand this action may be effective without further reference to the Mayor . If only reductions are made , the budget becomes law in the form in which it leaves the hands of the Council . If the legislative branch , however , makes additions , it must state each item separately . A month is allowed the Council for this work . When the budget is returned to the Mayor on April 15 he may sign it with the addition which the Council has made or he may veto each separate addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-thirds vote . If there is a filibuster or other delay preventing action by May 1 the budget stands as originally recommended by the Mayor . The economy budget of this year , effected by salary cuts ranging from 71A to 30 per cent and by important refunding of debts , precipitated a fight which raged almost to the last legal date . A final veto by the Mayor and failure by the Council to muster a two-thirds1 overruling vote carried the strug-gle within three days of the limit , but the result was that the reductions of both Mayor and Council became effective and all attempts at increases failed . Partisan antagonism operated to save the money of the citizens . If this object lesson suggests to other communities that Buffalo has developed a budget system worth studying , investigators will find no obstacles in their way .
