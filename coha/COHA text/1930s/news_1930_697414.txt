txt Philip Snowden , Chancellor of the Exchequer , has won his fight in the British Cabinet against protection , and the Imperial Conference is to be informed that Great Britain will not accept the proposals for reciprocal preferential protection asked by the dominions , led by Canada . This may be done on Monday or later next week , but there is no longer any room for doubt about the decision of the Government . At the same time the British Cabinet will put forward its scheme for bulk purchases abroad by government boards  --  In other words , State buying of Britain 's needs abroad . This is said to be no more satisfactow to Prime Minister Bennett of Canada than his proposals are to Mr. Snowden , who dominates the British Cabinet . Thomas Announces Stand . The way the wind Is blowing was clearly indicated by the speech which J. H. Thomas , Secretary for Dominions , made at a luncheon today to the dominion delegates . Especially striking was Mr. Thomas 's criticism of the Canadian proposals because he personally had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every dominion delegate , " Mr. Thomas aserted , " has said his first interest was his own people . They say , ' We first and the empire second . ' In sporting terms they hope the rest will be among the also rans . Well , that 's our position too . I say on behalf of the British Government that our first thought must be for our own people . " We as a government are accused of not having a policy . Suppose , on the opening of the conference , I had set forth our position . What a row there would have been ! We would have been accused of making up our minds before hearing the others . I kept the door open and told the dominions to put their cards on the table . " Stresses Old Country 's Burden . Mr. Thomas said the dominions should not forget that the old country bore the greatest burden of all parts of the empire , that the dominions ' security was guaranteed by Britain and that their ability to borrow money depended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , " do not let us be blinded by sentiments which might do incalculable harm . " The greatest of all dangers at the conference he thought would be a panic . " We have got to be practical , and do not let us quarrel because there are differences as to methods . " What will happen to Premier Bennett 's plan , on which he demanded a yes or no answer , is anybody 's guess . Since the Conservatives wish to make it an issue for the next general election , one may guess the whole economic end of the Imperial Conference may be referred to a committee composed of representatives of members of the British Commonwealth of Nations pending the fighting out of the issue before the British electors , which probably will take place next Spring . Mr. Snowden politically is a free trader . But he would scarcely confine his reply to the dominions to a lecture on the theoretical blessings of the absence of tariff walls , because the six dominions now have protective tariffs . Mr. Snowden will turn to the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . presume to predict what will be said by the most able Chancellor of the Exchequer , one is free to speculate on what he may say . It is a perfectly good guess Mr. Snowden will inform the dominions they have been selfish , that they seek only better markets for them- selves in Great Britain , and that their 10 per cent preference tariff means little when they have by their existing tariffs virtually shut out the goods England would most wish to sell them . When the wall is too high to jump , Mr. Snowden will argue , one brick less on the top of it matters little . Then he may be expected , after telling the dominions that Britain already buys more from them than they buy from Britain , to emphasize that less than half of Britain 's foreign trade is with the dominions , while the rest is scattered all over the world . It would not be to Britain 's interest to jeopardize the larger portion of her foreign business to help the minor portion . . He may be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South America , where she must compete with the Unit " d States . In South America lies one-fifth of Britain 's foreign investments . She can not , therefore , resort to protective tariffs which would , it is held , hamper her South American trade . The Chancellor of the Exchequer may say that Britain 's economic position has been based on free imports of raw materials and free exports of manufactured articles , and he will deny that anything has happened to alter the conclusions to be drawn from that position . Since it would be in keeping with his disposition , he will probably have caustic things to say about the ben ' efits of protection to the countries which have it . He may talk about the situation in the United States and Germany , and he may even ask why , if protection is so efficacious , Canada now finds herself seeking a better foreign trade position . Snowden Ready for Fight . At any rate , he will turn down Mr. Bennett 's proposal and turn it down hard . If the Conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to fight it out with them . From this it may be seen that the chances of the Imperial Cour- accomplishing anything definite in the economic field are very slim . It may lay the groundwork which 11 might result in British protection if the Conservatives win the next gen ! eral election . But the issue must wait on that development . Mr. Snowden will not permit Mr. Thomas or his followers or even Premier to swing to pro- : tection . In fact , when the Prime Minister 's turn to speak came at yesterday 's meeting of the heads of the conference delegations , he announced that Mr. Snowden would explain the Cabinet 's position . Mr. Snowden did it very plainly and then announced that the formal position would be placed before the conference in the near future . Assails Baldwin . Tomorrow 's Daily Herald , a Labor organ , will publish a statement by Premier assailing Stanley Baldwin , Conservative leader , for making a political issue of the Imperial Conference situation . " I am perfectly amazed at Mr. Baldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws the Imperial Conference right into the arena of partisan controversy and puts the Prime Ministers of the dnminion in a most unfortunate position . " He does not know what is going on nor does he know , indeed , in precise business terms what is involved in the declarations at the Imperial Conference which he has adopted and has informed the country he has made into his own program . " All I can say is that the Conservative party has once more changed the fly with which it is fishing for votes and also that when the new fly is examined it will be even worse as bait than some of the previous ones . " Nothing would please me more than for Mr. Baldwin to go to the country asking for power to impose double duties on wheat and also to tax our imports of raw material as part of the Tory program to reduce our costs of production and open the way into foreign markets . That will deceive nobody . " I should have thought party pronouncements might have been postponed until the negotiations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the dominion Premiers how hampering it is that every word they say is to be taken up here by rival politicians and turned into party cries . " Mr. went on to say the conference was examining the meaning of trade figures and seeking how the rival economic interests within the empire can be made into mutual helpfulness . " When that work is finished , " he continued , " and it will not take very long , then I should have thought mould be Mr. Baldwin 's time for tellus what a Conservative thinks . I iuiow Mr. Baldwin 's internal c it -s , but I would beg of him not to rig harm to the negotiations and ex ; ... minations which are on foot . That only means he should ' keep silent for a week . or ' twO. , ' He will then be in *a position to , pass judgment on the final pronouncements and not . on the opening statements which allow of all sorts of accommodations and friendly understandings .
