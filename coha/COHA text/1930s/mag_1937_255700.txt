Seven to seven , San Francisco 's Art Commission stood deadlocked last week after months of bitter bickering . The question at issue was whether or not the city should authorize the erection of a 180-ft. stainless steel statue of St. Francis on Christmas Tree Point , across the city from famed Telegraph Hill . Leading the opposition were Banker Herbert Fleishhacker and Mrs. Adolph B. Spreckels ; champions for the defense were Artist William Gaskin and a Mrs. Marie de Lavega Welch West . Words grew hotter , tempers frayed . <P> " Send for the Mayor , " someone cried . " He has a vote ! ' ' <P> In due time Mayor Angelo Rossi appeared , listened to the arguments and promptly cast his vote in favor of the statue . Out in the corridor an excited crowd almost mobbed Sculptor Beniamino Bufano . " Good old Benny ! " they shouted . " The statue wins ! " Artist Bufano , who chopped off his trigger ringer during the War , frequently sleeps in his clothes , and lives almost exclusively on nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a burning ambition to give San Francisco a heroic statue of her patron saint . <P> In Paris a few years ago he completed one of black granite , 25 ft. high , 10 ft. thick at the base . When San Franciscans failed to produce enough money to move it sight unseen to California , he abandoned it in a French barn ( where it is still held for unpaid storage ) and returned to California with two smaller statues salvaged from stone chopped out from under the saint 's arms . <P> The growth of WPA projects gave Sculptor Bufano another chance . Abandoning stone , he thought of a figure of glittering stainless steel , arms upraised in benediction . He made a model of redwood and copper , shrewdly choosing Regional Director Joseph Danysh of the Federal Art Project for his model . Then the arguments were on . Even the Catholic Church was divided , Father George of the Franciscans , representing the Father Provincial of the Western United States , violently objecting that the statue was an insult to his Order , Archbishop Mitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , the statue will cost $35,000 , and weigh 65 tons . A new stainless alloy containing 2% white glass will be used for the sheets forming the statue . There will be an interior staircase , an observation platform in the Apostle of Humility 's head , and on the too of his head will splash a drinking fountain and bath for the wild birds St. Francis loved .
