9 ONE SUNDAY last spring an airplane flew over the uptown districts of New York , broadcasting through an amplifier a musical program interspersed with vocal advertisement of a business house . Millions of people heard it ? had to hear it , if they lived anywhere along its route , or if in an area of a hundred square miles or so they had chosen to spend a pleasant afternoon out of doors . It seems likely that few of them enjoyed this assault upon their ears , and many of them must have reflected that it was only a feeble foretaste of what life will be like when aerial broadcasting is general . That sort of thing has been stopped ? for the moment ; it would be reckless to predict that the prohibition will continue if somebody with political influence wants to advertise something . But was it stopped by the spontaneous protesting roar of millions of people ? Not at all . Only one man complained ? a clergyman who was offended less by the noise than by the desecration of the Sabbath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be a man of intelligence , who realized that if airplane advertising once got a foothold it would become an intolerable nuisance . You may ask what better could be expected of New Yorkers , who permit their government to dispose of sewage by dumping it into the waters that surround the town , and of garbage by tossing it in the sea just outside the harbor , whence it floats back to carpet the bathing beaches . ( This pleasant practice is about to be stopped , but only because the Chambers of Commerce of New Jersey shore resorts had the matter taken into the Federal Courts . ) Browbeaten and subdued by the daily degrada tion of being herded into the subway , New Yorkers have perhaps lost the spirit to resent anything ; certainly they remain indifferent to revelations about the government of their city that would have produced quite a com motion fifty or even twenty years ago . But are inlanders any better ? Is there anything that would make the American people of to-day stand up on its hind legs and roar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers against a man who wants to live different ly from the majority for his own satisfac tion ; but when a man invades the rights of the rest of us for his own profit , it seems to be the general feeling that he is entitled to all he can get away with . Roadside billboards annoy millions of peopie , since the whole country goes driving along the roads ; yet the war against them meets with very moderate success , and even that success is due less to the efforts of nature-lovers than to the support of the newspapers , jealous of billboard competi tion . The average citizen may ask why he should take sides in a fight between rival sellers of ad vertising space , but there is a difference . What makes outdoor advertising , audible or visible , of fensive is the fact that it is inescapable . Nobody is compelled to buy a newspaper or a magazine , and if he buys it he is not compelled to read the advertisements . Nobody has to buy a radio ; and if he listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising talk and switch in again on the music that follows . But the billboard forces itself on the attention of every passer-by ; the flying broadcaster compels a whole countryside to hear him .  | Now they are beginning to advertise in the movies . It could be argued that if you buy a magazine for a story you want to read , without being offended by the advertising in the adjacent column , you can take a movie program in the same spirit . But you can read what you like in the magazine ; you read the advertisements only when the advertiser works for his money , produces something that attracts your attention . In the movies you must look at , or at least listen to , the advertising , unless you want to walk out on the rest of the show . Will movie-goers stand for this ? Well , they seem to be willing to stand for practically anything . A man who does not like any particular advertising campaign has his recourse ; he can refuse to buy the product it recommends . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be influenced by many other factors ; rare is the instance when an offensive advertising campaign has been checked by public sentiment . Many people are disgusted by faked testimonials , but their use does not seem to be unprofitable . One of the most conspicuously successful of modern advertising campaigns leaps gayly from one unsupported and improbable assertion to another . It happens to recommend a product which many people like and which would sell widely on its merits ; I wish I could believe the immense recent sale is due to the merit of the goods rather than the brazen effrontery of the advertising . I would not seem to be disrespectful to advertising ; I know well that my own trade is a mere parasitic mistletoe on that sturdy oak . But it seems a little ominous for the future of this country that so many advertisers should assume that the public is chiefly composed of imbeciles ? and get away with it . II M0ST OF us will listen to anything with which a man who has something to sell sees fit to assail our ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes . You do not have to read advertisements , or look at the movies , or listen to the radio ; but you can not help looking at conspicuous buildings , and it seems to be generally felt that the sort of building a man puts up is his own business . True , the zoning movement has spread ; in self-defense the community has decreed that a man may not put up a commercial building in a residence district ( unless he has political influence ) , that he must observe certain minimum requirements as to light and air and fire protection . But for what his building looks like he is responsible only to his own conscience . So New York , containing some of the world 's most beautiful buildings , contains also some of the most hideous , planted on sites where you can not help seeing them . I have not seen the Paramount Theater in Paris , but I am told that it is a gem . If you want to build a theater in Paris , public opinion requires that it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to put up a theateroffice building on the busiest square in New York they knew they could put up anything that seemed good to them ; and their creation sticks out like a sore thumb . Mr. Raymond Hood , who has designed some of the most admired and some of the most bitterly criticized buildings in the country , argues that an architect 's responsibility , moral as well occupy it , not to the general public which merely looks at it . But the responsibility to the occupants implies nothing but decent interior planning , which is pretty general . A man 's office address is conditioned by rentals , location , the prestige of a new building , rather than its outward appearance . It can be very beautiful without greatly improving its prospect of one hundred per cent rental , or very ugly without much hurting it . But when you put up a building which hundreds of thousands of people can not help seeing every day , I do not see why those people should be nauseated  | merely because an architect is whimsical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the public does complain . It is a healthy sign that quite a good deal of criticism has been provoked ( with some hope of being effective ) by the designs of the new Radio City which is to be built on Fifth Avenue ; but that was the fault of the preliminary ballyhoo . We were encouraged to believe that the projectors of Radio City were successors to Augustus and the Medici , preparing to adorn New York with a supernal triumph of American architecture out of mere big-heartedness . Naturally there was a roar when the published designs revealed something that looked like the average radio program translated into steel and concrete . If the builders had not professed to be doing any more than putting up the sort of buildings they thought would pay , few people would have challenged their right to make them as ugly as they chose . This did not matter so much ? nothing mattered so much ? in the old days when a man who did not like the way things were going where he lived could move far enough away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet filled up , but the parts of it that people want to live in are filling up rapidly ; the automobile has abolished isolation , and the airplane threatens to abolish privacy even in the open spaces . We are going to have to learn to live together in closer quarters ; and we might profitably be more tolerant of some things and less of others . It is none of my business if the couple across the court from my apartment are living in sin , but it is my business if they leave their radio turned on all night . ( I speak of a theoretical couple ; the actual couple across the court are married and noiseless . ) But if I complained to the police , even in New York , on the first of these counts , I should stand a better chance of getting something done about it than if I objected to the noise . Almost everywhere in apartment houses , increasingly even in residence districts since the loud speaker was invented , the neighbors ' noise is one of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic congestion ) go about as far to explain the discontent of modern city dwellers as the spiritual factors that are more talked about . But what can be done about noise ? In some apartment houses flagrant and repeated offenses lead to the expulsion of the offenders ; but more often than not the noise goes on till the noise-makers collapse in an alcoholic stupor . Homicide as such is too popular in this country ; but homicide as the only cure for noisy neighbors is astonishingly infrequent ? perhaps regrettably so . Older nations , which had no great open spaces to fill up , got used long ago to living in close quarters , and in varying degree learned the adjustments that make life tolerable . The old Chinese culture , one is told , was especially successful in this . Certainly the pre-war English had pretty well solved the problem ; and not as the Germans solved it , by inspiring everybody with awe of the police , but by a slowly matured habit of minding their own business and expecting other people to mind theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Trespassing Forbidden . By Order . " Whose order ? Usually you had to guess . I think the reaction of the average American to that cryptic notice would have been to go ahead and trespass ? to find out who had given the order and what , if anything , was going to be done about it . Not so the English ; they took it for granted that it had been ordered by proper authority . But try to infringe on what one of those apparently docile Englishmen considered his personal liberties and you would have a fight on your hands ; he would stand up for his rights , stand on precedents and guarantees  | running back seven hundred years . The war , of course , changed everything ; the English lost most of their rights temporarily and have not yet recovered them all . The post-war Englishman is impoverished and usually dispirited ; but he still has a good deal more liberty than we to behave as he likes , so long as he does not annoy his neighbors ? and a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own profit . @# THE FRONTIER has been given credit for most of our national virtues and most of our national faults , so it is with some diffidence that I wonder if this trait too is not the work of the frontier influence . The suggestion is merely tossed up for whatever professional historians may find it worth ; but it seems plausible . For this docility has its reverse side ; we let other people impose on us with the tacit understanding that when our turn comes they will let us impose on them . The man who has something to gain by it ? especially money ? has the right of way ; the man who stands up and protests against what the majority is willing to tolerate is laughed off as a crank , if he is not suppressed as a nuisance . In the old days he did not have to undergo that humiliation . If he did not like the way things were done he had his choice of two courses ? to stay at home and put up a fight , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to get into a covered wagon and go west till he found some place where he could manage things to his own taste . When he found that place the memory of old quarrels still rankled ; he was as inhospitable to dissenters as the majority back home had been to him ; anybody who did not like his way of doing things could pack up and go still farther west . We owe much to the adventurous courage of the pioneer , the constructive impulse of the empire builder ; we owe as much or more to the love of money which lured men on to places where more money could be made . But besides all that , one large factor in the conquest and settlement of this continent was the fact that it was often easier to move on and build an empire than to stay at home and put up a fight . And the land was rich ? a virgin continent with wealth waiting for the taking ; the rush for it was in many places more or less of a free-for-all ; but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellow 's way . ( Exceptions were plentiful , but as a generalization that statement holds true . ) So the tradition grew up that a man who was after the money was at liberty to do pretty much as he saw fit . Now the country is more crowded ; he is apt to step on our toes . But we still let him do it . This may perhaps explain some of the public apathy to governmental corruption . If officials , too often , were working for their own pockets , so were most of us ; and if we got ours we have generally been willing to let them get theirs too . It may explain some of the indifference to organized crime , so long as its exactions are levied on somebody else . In the fluid society of the old days , when everybody was on the make , you admired the man who was " making good . " The mere phrase implies a general feeling that to make was good in itself ; what you made was of less importance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . They have adjusted themselves , in their own way , to living in a complex society . I think the defeatist awe of the racketeer which pervades so much of contemporary fiction ? the conviction that he is a better man than we and there is no use trying to resist him ? is a spiritual malady not yet epidemic ; most people are not yet afraid of the racketeer because they have not yet had any occasion to feel any concrete personal emotion about him at all . But the time may  | come when all of us shall have to feel about him ; and we might have more hope of solving our major problems if we showed a little more spirit in dealing with minor annoyances . A man who can stop the noise across the airshaft is not necessarily capable of cleaning up his city government and breaking the power of criminal gangs ; but these feats are not likely to be accomplished by a man who is too meek to try to stop the noise across the airshaft. @# A LITTLE APATHY IS a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things that are not worth getting excited about . But in the happy days of Coolidge prosperity most of us decided that nothing was worth getting excited about but the rising stock market , and now that those bright hopes have vanished all the world seems indifferent to less potent stimuli . Mr. Chesterton , finishing a tour in America , lately remarked on the vigor of intellectual discussion he found here , a pleasant contrast to the apathy of his own people . But Mr. Chesterton moved in a limited circle ; that is proved by the fact that what he heard most talked about was Humanism , a fad even more evanescent than mah Jong . Certainly those who call themselves intellectuals ? even if they deny one another 's right to that title ? have fallen from their high estate of five or six years ago . In those days they were perhaps not apathetic enough ; they made a terrible hullabaloo about everything , discovered that there was nothing much to be done about it ? and now , in disillusion , a good many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racketeer who gets away with it when they ca n't ; while others are going over to Catholicism or Communism ( usually the latter ) which offers a higher authority to do their thinking for them . That is probably a temporary phase ? like the present apathy of the stock market , a reaction from the overstimulation of the past . I can not guess what will stir the intellectuals up again any more than I can guess what stocks will in the next five years make big money for their purchasers ; but it is a safe prediction that there will be a recovery in the idea industry as in all others . More disturbing than the present apathy of the working intellectuals is the continuing docility of those who may be called the passive intellectuals ; the people who do not produce ideas , but may be counted on to comprehend them in moderation and put some force behind them . The majority of those people still read the books that it is respectable to read , even though the criteria of respectability have been altered ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read now take what they get from the book club . The book clubs , in general , have given them very much better fare than they would have been likely to select on their own initiative ; but it might be a healthier sign for American letters if people read the bad books they picked themselves rather than the good books somebody else picks out for them . It is the passive intellectuals , in the main , who support the visiting European lecturer ; and their toleration of some of these distinguished personalities is one more proof of apathy . Visiting European lecturers have been criticized perhaps more harshly than they deserve . If not all of them have the tact and good manners of such men as Galsworthy or Maurois , they show up about as well as would the average of American authors in a comparable situation . The foreign author regards America , I suspect , very much as the New York author regards Hollywood ? a place whose inhabitants have somehow managed to amass more money than they can profitably use . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them but much for the visitor ? to an outlander who seems to have  | something they want ( however ridiculous their wants may appear to him ) , he might as well take it . That is a reasonable way to feel , even if good manners suggest that you should not express it too plainly . But there are visiting lecturers and visiting lecturers ; there was , for instance , Count Keyserling . It is true that the formidable schedule of demands which was presented to the people who had to entertain him was an asking price ; he insisted on champagne , but if driven to it he would drink what you had . But the fact that he was permitted to get away with it all over the country is proof that despite prohibition and Ku Kluxism we are in some ways a tolerant people . Too tolerant . Well , does it matter ? That question can always be asked of any critic of American ways , and till lately the answer seemed to be " No . " With all our faults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting away with it just now ; and even when business improves it will be harder than it was two years ago to believe that we can get away with it forever . Public life was probably more corrupt sixty years ago than now ; criminal gangs dominate many of our cities and the city has been called the new frontier , but they often dominated the old frontier too . But on the old frontier the gangs were smashed when the country settled up and the law came in ; now the country is settled , the law has come in ? and gone out again . It may take some effort to bring it back . Further , we can no longer consider America in itself ; we must consider America as a unit in the society of nations ? the richest unit and the strongest , in so far as wealth is power . Ten years ago most Europeans were afraid of us because they knew how any European power would behave in our position ; a few of them hoped we would save the world because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some thought we would behave badly , some thought we would behave well ; but hardly anyone expected that , as a nation , we would not behave at all . We are still , potentially , the strongest power in the world ; but Europe has ceased to fear much from us , or to hope much either . There are grave disadvantages in the foreign policy advocated by war-time idealists ? the policy which at its extreme would have had us take a mandate for Armenia and defend that much persecuted nation against all corners . It entails tremendous risks for America with no certainty that we should do any good to anybody else ; but at least it is ? or was in its day ? a policy , a consistent policy , defensible on its own premises . There are equally grave disadvantages of another sort in the policy of which the Chicago Tribune is the chief exponent ? jingo imperialism , the doctrine that they should take who have the power and they may keep who can . ( The Tribune does not approve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago . ) It would be of dubious benefit to anybody else and would certainly work serious moral harm to America ? quite possibly serious material harm too . But at least it is a policy , a consistent policy , defensible on its own premises . Still less attractive is the Borah-Johnson doctrine of pure isolation , but even that is defensible on its own premises ; though in the day of radio and transatlantic aviation and planetary economics those premises are painfully antiquated . Even that is better than a total unawareness that we need any foreign policy at all ; and this last seems to be the mental state of the majority of the American people . I do n't believe we can go on getting away with it . As an ex-Calvinist I may take things too seriously ; but I do not believe a great power can exist in an interdependent world without some consideration of its relation to its neighbors , and some fairly coherent theory by which its international behavior is guided . or do I think the average peaceful citizen an go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up occasionally for what rights he has left . The frontier is gone ; we ca n't run away from it ; we must stay at home and either put up a fight or take it lying down . And we might as well start at the beginning . When a few dozen people have been shot by neighbors whom their loud speakers had tormented beyond endurance , we can begin to feel that America is on the way up .  |
