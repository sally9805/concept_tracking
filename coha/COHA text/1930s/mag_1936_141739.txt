Come and Get It ( Samuel Goldwyn ) gives Actor Edward Arnold , recently seen as Diamond Jim Brady and General John Sutter , another subject for his full-length screen portraiture of hearty , colorful U. S. types . Lifted this time from Edna Ferber fiction instead of history , the subject is Bernard Glasgow , Wisconsin lumber millionaire . The result , against a background first of lumber camps and small-town saloons , later of early 20th-century urban plutocracy , is an extraordinarily warm and lively picture of one of the few romantic aspects of the U. S. which the cinema has so far neglected . <P> To rise from head of a timber crew in the north woods to the partnership he has set his heart on , Barney Glasgow has to do more than spur his gang on to a record cutting . He has to marry the boss 's unappealing daughter . For this high hurdle in ambition 's path he gets up courage by a brief affair with a dance-hall hostess ( Frances Farmer ) , not the least of whose charms is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a barroom brawl . When Glasgow goes off to marry his heiress , the eccentric Swede foreman ( Walter Brennan ) who has been his best friend stays on to marry the dance-hall girl . It takes a full generation for Barney Glasgow to count the gains and losses of this move . The final audit comes when , the richest man in the State , he discovers in the old Swede 's daughter the image of his old flame . Barney showers benefits on the family . His efforts to renew his youth by making the young girl his mistress are frustrated by her romance with his son ( Joel McCrea ) . <P> Come and Get It was budgeted by expansive Producer Goldwyn at $1,000,000 . It cost 25% more . Part of the increase was caused by delay when Director Howard Hawks quit , after differences of opinion with Producer Goldwyn , to be replaced by William Wyler . Part was caused by Stunt Director Richard Rosson 's discovery , when he went to the north woods to photograph lumberjacks riding falling trees or breaking up log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of lumberjacks , are scorned by contemporaries as unsophisticated generosity to their employers . He had to return to Hollywood to recruit a crew of fake lumberjacks with enough courage to do what real lumberjacks are supposed to do . Included in the uproar concerning production of Come and Get It was the story which billed Actress Andrea Leeds as Hollywood 's " kiss champion ' ' after she had spent more than nine hours kissing three young actors to test their ability to play the role of her fianc in the film . Winner was tall , tennis-playing Francis Xavier Shields . In the course of the picture , he and Actress Leeds ( Barney 's daughter ) kiss neither each other nor anyone else .
