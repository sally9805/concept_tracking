 | @# Wanted Ten Thousand Good Samaritans By Francis Rufus Bellamy Over a quarter of a century ago a New York publisher discovered that he could feed people in a self-sustaining restaurant for five cents a day . During the last four years he has not only kept six such restaurants going , successfully , but he has made every effort to tell the world about it so that somebody else might go and do likewise . Yet nobody else has had the initiative for a similar effort . Why ? Again , there is a small series of struggling emergency day nurseries scattered over the country , sponsored so far by Harry Hopkins and the Federal Government . This new nursery relieves hard-pressed parents of the daily care of their children , in the children 's formative years before kindergarten age . It has done this so successfully for poor children that college instructors who have come in contact with it have made every effort to have their own children taken in . This nursery fills the gap in our public school system , long recognized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breadline , it has had the almost religious support of many distinguished people , including Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt . Yet the chances are that as a means of helping our neighbors in distress it will fail of eventual country-wide recognition - despite the efforts of its supporters and in the face of the fact that it has had Federal backing . It is a common-sense method whereby the unemployed can help the unemployed . But nobody whom I can find is taking it up . Again , why ? Certainly there is nothingwrong with either of these enterprises . One meets the most pressing social need of most communities : cheap food for those in straitened circumstances . The other takes care , in an intelligent manner , of otherwise neglected children from almost desperate homes . It is not only first aid for worried mothers , it builds definitely for the future of our citizenship . Both enterprises constitute solutions for basic problems created by the depression - solutions which are practical and which can be achieved by individuals alone or working together , with or without official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernarr MacFadden made his  | first experiment with a penny restaurant on the Bowery in 1907-When prosperity returned he closed it . In 1931 he fitted up a small store on Third Avenue to serve nourishing and really palatable dishes , at a penny , to 40 customers at a time . The effort was a success . It was not charity . It was a real penny restaurant . People , decent people , who were temporarily up against it , patronized it . After an initial loss of $600 - a cent each on its first 60,00o meals - it paid its way . Anybody with a little money , some initiative and a flair for getting fun out of the air could have done it . Encouraged , MacFadden opened a larger one on 43rd street near Seventh Avenue . Again success came ; well-known people gave the project publicity by visiting it ; police officials welcomed it as an aid to crime prevention ; thousands of books of tickets were distributed through charity organizations by a group of citizens whose conscience hurt them every time they turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three more restaurants in New York , one in Brooklyn , one in Chicago and one in Washington . All paid their way . To date he has served 10 million meals for So million pennies ; 15,500 people use his restaurants every day . Favorite dishes served are , in the order of their preference , cracked wheat , bean soup , corn meal , raisin coffee , soaked prunes and raisins and meat cakes . Old ladies , farmer boys , young girls looking for work , jobless old men buy these dishes . Nobody knows what many of these penny bowls of soup mean to these people . From the beginning , the methods of buying and preparing the food have been open to anybody . Now , obviously , there are difficulties in imitating an enterprise like this . NRA wage scales , proper locations , a possible lack of the volume necessary for financial success - all these things present problems . But difficulties are inherent in any human enterprise . The point is , any already selfsupporting individual with time and initiative , who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his town could probably finally succeed in establishing one , either personally or under the auspices of some group . Whether the restaurant eventually charged one cent or two cents for its dishes is immaterial . At least the poor in pocket would be helped . Similarly , difficulties would undoubtedly attend the efforts of any man or woman who got together a group of friends , found a suitable free building , secured the necessary information from the U. S. Office of Education in Washington , got trained unem-  | ployed helpers - from seven to eleven people are required for every 30 children-and put a nursery school in operation in his community . But since when have difficulties daunted Americans ? Since when must relief agencies and governmental boards start everything for us ? What has become of our ancient individual initiative ? I defy any human being , specifically , to go to the Hill Top Nursery school on West 123rd street in New York and come away unchanged . An abandoned Jewish synagogue , scrubbed clean , is the setting . Cracker boxes , homemade wooden blocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap cots , child-size wooden chairs and low tables , placed in bare , highceilinged rooms - these are the furnishings . But everywhere is order , quiet and cleanliness . In an improvised kitchen the daily meals are prepared at a cost of 8 cents per child . Tomato juice waits for the mid-morning feeding . Downstairs , at the entrance , is the chart where the mother first stops with her child every morning and gives the record of the child 's sleep and food this morning at home-not always , alas , the truth in these days of poverty . Mothers have pride . A nurse next examines each small pupil - they range from 18 months to four years ! - and then come the play and rest rooms , each with a teacher . Here are our future citizens . One hundred children . From homes where no security , rest or peace is possible . Some are dazed little waifs , recently come , underfed , unaware of the use of a toy . All are children who would be otherwise neglected , whose mothers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nine till four , getting a glimpse of childhood 's rightful heritage , reserved so far in America only for the children of the well-to-do . Not everybody , of course , could succeed with these enterprises , or would want to - any more than everybody wants to play golf well , or can . But they are dramatic illustrations of what can be done by people who care to do it . Today , the depression has created a condition which is getting beyond the reach of governmental or local agencies , one that should be met in part by the individual , inspired by the ancient tradition of American neighborliness . For those who will use their leisure time to help their neighbors , the field lies wide open . Zona Gale , for instance , tells of a woman in Portage , the lovely Wisconsin town in which she lives . This woman was simply a justice of the peace . But for 14  | years , until her death in 1932 , she made herself the village employment agency , welfare center and associated charities rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help , although she was without means . Only by extreme self-denial did she succeed in educating her two daughters . But in the storeroom back of her office she set a tub and hung a mirror . Down-and-out strangers could at least have a shave and a bath . Any town ought to be able to provide that much free . When she received a small fee , as a justice of the peace , she put 17 cents in a little basket on her desk . You could get three pairs of socks for 17 cents in Portage - and walking , looking for work , is a footsore business . As for food , when hungry men or women came to her door , she had an account with Dog Wagon Harry when she had no cash . When she was able to provide coffee and bread herself , she went down to the local " calaboose " and asked unfortunate vagrants up to an eight o'clock breakfast . Portage had no policewoman , so Elizabeth Cushing was the person to telephone when someone was in distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , crying by the bandstand in the darkness . Elizabeth Cushing found out the trouble , verified it and guaranteed a night 's lodging at the small local hotel . If the case was worthy , she sometimes gave up her own bed . She had no spare room . In the closet off her office was a space set aside for old clothes - disused garments , she called them . She would interrupt any case before her to show an unemployed man to the shirt pile . Elizabeth Cushing is still known in Portage as the woman who would never turn down anyone in distress . To Zona Gale , she was the most interesting person in her town . Hers was the neighborly spirit in its purest form . She was an example of precisely what I am talking about . Multiply her story in ten thousand of our towns and villages , according to the varied gifts and interests of ten thousand individuals , and it takes no prophet to point out the social results . As an individual , certainly she proved that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much too high . Compare it with the actual value that lies in the driving force of a single person of courage and initiative who realizes that imaginative effort in the interest of others pays higher personal dividends than the most absorbing hobby .
