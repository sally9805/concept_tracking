A year after the opening of Spam 's bloody , but undermanned civil war , neither Leftists nor Rightists lack able staff officers . What both sides do need is enough troops for effective action on five separate fronts that snake for nearly 1,200 miles down the midriff of Spain . For some months military observers on both sides have cynically propounded a convenient rule : they will concede definite military superiority to whichever side is able to maintain an offensive for three successive days . <P> By last week 's end that rule was still unbroken , but plenty was happening on both sides to keep correspondents busy . Madrid observers reported that masses of troops and a dusty serpent of nearly 1,000 motor trucks were climbing the ridges , moving north for a final assault on Santander , last important stronghold of the starving Basque defenders of Bilbao . <P> Quickly correspondents in Loyalist Spain translated this as an admission that the potent Rightist assault against Madrid of fortnight ago had broken down . For many weeks they have been aware that the Italian and German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded headquarters directly opposite the west door of Salamanca Cathedral , have advocated two different plans of campaign for the remainder of the summer . Basically the German scheme was to immunize every front but Madrid , try to lure the Leftists into one more half baked offensive , always fruitful of casualties , and then mass every available man from Malaga and the South , the Basque front , Toledo , Teruel to make one great conclusive drive against Madrid . <P> Basis of the Italian plan was to do something quickly to restore Italy 's battered military prestige . Santander , once the favorite yachting centre of the Basque Riviera , is less protected by mountains than is Bilbao . There are not more than 5,000 exhausted Basque militiamen to guard it , and though Valencia has been able to sneak a few planes through to Santander in recent weeks , a service it could not perform for Bilbao , the overwhelmingly superior Rightist forces on the Basque front ought to be able to capture Santander in less than a week , any time the order is issued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dearly love to make a grandiloquent state entry into Santander and then , if possible , in the opposite corner of Spain , where other Italian thousands are quartered , extend that stalemated front from Malaga to Almeria for another publicized victory . It would then be time enough for a final decisive attack on Madrid . <P> The half-successful Leftist offensive of last month ( TIME , July 19 , et seq. ) shelved the Italian scheme for weeks . By any scheme of tactics a counteroffensive was immediately necessary and it was undertaken with continuing but vague reports of Rightist successes . Then last week came that serpent of troops and trucks from Burgos and Vitoria . It meant that the Rightist offensive at Madrid had been checked too , and the Italian plan was getting another inning .
