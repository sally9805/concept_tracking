To the American Association for the Advancement of Science , meeting in Milwaukee last week , Dr. Victor George Heiser ( An American Doctor 's Odyssey ) made a powerful plea for proper stoking of the human machine . Science has proved , said he , that the greatest factor in longevity is correct eating . <P> Dr. Heiser quoted a now-classic experiment : " Sir Robert McCarrison established in India in the early 1920s a thoroughly healthy rat colony . The 1,189 stock rats were fed a diet similar to that eaten by certain peoples of northern India , among whom are some of the finest physical specimens of mankind . The diet consisted of whole-wheat flour , unleavened bread lightly smeared with fresh butter , sprouted Bengal gram ( legume ) , fresh raw carrots and cabbage , unboiled whole milk , a small ration of raw meat with bones once a week . . . . During two and a quarter years about 70 years for human beings there was no illness among these rats , no deaths from natural causes occurred in the adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Another group of 2,243 rats was given food eaten by natives of southern India , who are puny and disease-ridden . Their menu , cereal grains and vegetable fats , no milk , butter or fresh vegetables . Not only were these rats stricken with well-known deficiency diseases such as pernicious anemia ( lack of iron ) , goiter ( lack of iodine ) , beriberi ( lack of vitamin B ) , but they also developed pneumonia , pleurisy , deafness , adenoids , eye ulcers , kidney stones , gastric ulcers , heart disease , skin infections . <P> Dr. Reiser 's moral : a well-balanced diet fortifies man against most of the common diseases . <P> For years nutritionists have tried to teach the U. S. public common sense about eating . But most people who can afford to eat well eat unwisely , pour enormous quantities of oils , sugars and refined starches into their overworked digestive engines . " If a diet is correctly balanced , " said Dr. Heiser , " a smaller quantity of food will suffice . " Certain it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outliving their self-indulgent friends . Facts on food : <P> &gt; There is no standard diet to fit all ages and classes . A hard-working farmer or laborer needs an abundance of fuel foods such as bread , potatoes and meat . A growing child needs almost twice as much food as his sedentary father . A Southerner needs less starch , sugar and fat than a Northerner . A desk-bound businessman needs practically no white bread , potatoes , cakes and pies . But for health and longevity , eaters of all ages and classes must tuck in one quart of milk every day , a variety of vegetables , fruits , fresh red meat , fish , and eggs several times a week . Also essential are whole-wheat grains ( in bread ) . <P> &gt; Simplest vitamin rule : eat bright , colorful foods . Yellow foods , such as butter , corn , carrots , egg yolks , are rich in vitamin A ( essential for good eyesight ) . Greens are rich in minerals , and in vitamins A , B and C. With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Public Health Service , no healthy person need worry about vitamin deficiency , or spend money on pills , tonics , " vitaminized " foods .
