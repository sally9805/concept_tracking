txt The budget balancing program recommended by President Hoover will be placed before the House Economy Committee tomorrow in detail by Colonel J. Clawson Roop , Director of the Budget , as Congress enters upon the session 's most serious consideration of economic questions . Meanwhile , the Senate Finance Committee will resume hearings on the billion-dollar tax Increase , the largest revenue bill in our peace-time history . It is Increasingly apparent to Washington that the attention of the country has been focused upon the pressing necessity of balancing the budget by reductions in government expenditures , including salaries , with indications that Congress , under pressure of public sentiment , will be forced to abandon partisan considerations and agree on legislation on businesslike lines . While there was a disposition to accept the President 's cooperation in reducing government expenditures , members of the House Economy Committee indicated today that they would not accept the administration 's plan for " staggering " employment and reducing salaries through forced furloughs. for Committee Plan . Representative of Alabama , chairman of the Economy Committee , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the House tomorrow a percentage reduction of all governmental salaries . " The committee has already agreed that the way to meet the situation is to face it squarely and reduce the salaries 11 per cent , after an exemption of $1,000 , " Mr. said . " In other words , there would be a reduction of $88 on a salary of $1,800 . This seems to the committee fair , in that it would give the government employe some idea how he could meet his obligations . " Under the President 's plan of forced furloughs of a month or more , the way would be opened to_the discrimination and favoritism . My telephone has been ringing all day long , with Federal employes protesting against the furloughs proposal . " These employes intimated that favoritism would creep in . under the furlough system , and they preferred a percentage reduction in salary rather than to face the uncertainty of how far their furlough would extend and whether favoritism would be employed against them . " Expects Report Today . Mr. thought that the committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the latter would adopt the salary reductions as a rider . He estimated that a saving of $67,000,000 would be effected in the fiscal year 1933 , and that the same percentage of reduc- Lion would be applied to all government employes except those whose salaries are fixed by the Constitution , such as those of President and Federal judges . The administration is reported to be opposed to a large reduction in salaries . Organized labor leaders have also objected to the government adopting such a plan , on the ground that if it does so the system would be followed by States and cities and other governmental units . establishing a precedent which would be followed by industry generally . At no time during his conference with the Economy . Committee yesterday did the President suggest a percentage reduction in payroll . The President opened this phase of the discussion by saying he was willing to accept a cut in his salary , which is $75,000 a year . Congress can not reduce the President 's salary during the term for which he was elected , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Intends to recommend reductions in the President 's salary and in those of Federal judges , which would be effective after next March and would apply to new judges to be appointed . The President yesterday morning told the committee that a plan which seemed fair to him would be to have the Classification Board adjust Federal salaries all over the country in line with comparable work in private enterprises and industry . This plan would have effected a saving of more than $125,000,000 , it was estimated , and in the opinion of members of the committee would have been a too radical procedure . In the session yesterday afternoon the President abandoned this Idea and submitted for it the forced-fur1 I lough system and the introduction of a five-day week for per diem employes . Under such a procedure , there would be no exact percentage reduction that could be objected to by organized labor , which was reported to look with favor upon the administration 's proposal . The Economy Committee , according to Mr. , had previously discussed most of the ideas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to recommend many of them . The suggestion that the Philippine Government pay for maintaining the Philippine Scouts at an anneal cost of $5,000,000 and the closing of some navy yards , and the placing of per diem men on a five-day-a-week schedule , Mr. said , were among the new ideas advanced by the President . Declares Crisis Must Be Met . " We are glad to have the President 's suggestions and we intend to cooperate with him in meeting the situation , " Mr. added . " We are facing a crisis and we must meet it bravely . The government should do what men are doing in their private affairs , scale down salaries and all other expenses , and do it without regard to partisanship . " The Democrats intend to work with the President . We will produce a program that will help greatly in balancing the budget . " If the Republican Administration will join with the committee in an effort to effect economies in government , I believe the committee can present to the House bills which , if enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $150,000,000 to $200,000.000 . " We should meet the situation like Great Britain : impose heavy taxes and reduce all salaries 10 per cent or more . The railroads reduced their wages and salaries 10 per cent . Some States and cities have made similar reductions . The taxpayers have been forced to accept less pay , , and it seems to me that the government should follow suit . " But salaries should be reduced in such a way that every man can know how he is to be affected , and not through any indefinite forced furlough system that might lead to favoritism . " Under the committee 's 11 per cent reduction plan , the salaries of members of Congress would be reduced $99J a year . Senator Borah has a bill pending providing for a graduated cut which would reduce the salaries of Senators and Representatives $2,000 a year . He intends to fight for his plan and will offer it as an amendment to any program coming from the House . Prepare to Rush Tax Hearings . Hearings on the billion-dollar tax increase will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push the hearings as rapidly as possible in an effort to have the new taxes written into law before the national political conventions . Hearings have already been scheduled through April 22 . Witnesses scheduled for tomorrow 's hearing include F. I. Raymond of Chicago , James Lee Loomis of Hartford , Conn. , representing the Association of Life Insurance 1Presidents ; Byron K. Elliott , St. Louis , of the American Life Convention , and representatives of national farm organizations . The greatest menace to quick ac tion on the tax bill in the Senate continued to come today from efforts of Senators to use the measure as a vehicle for tariff duties . Trades already have been attempted by some of those favoring duties on copper , wood pulp , lumber , shingles and manganese , and those seeking to retain the oil and coal tariffs voted by the House . Senators Smoot , Walsh of Massachusetts , and Harrison , members of the Finance Committee , aided by Senator Tydings of Maryland , have launched a counter-move in an effort to forestall any . discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution pending , on which he will ask action this week , forbidding the Finance Committee to take up any tariff duties . The resolution would direct the committee to strike out the import taxes on coal and oil . Some leaders fear that if tariff discussions are once started , the attempt to pass the tax bill before the conventions might as well be abandoned . They point to the history of the Hawley-Smoot act , which blocked practically every other business in the Senate for eleven months and was eighteen months in getting through Congress . Democratic Senators will hold another conference this week with the avowed purpose of effecting a " meeting of minds " on the question of excluding tariff items from the tax bill . ?
