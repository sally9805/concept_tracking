For many a week Japanese , harassed by a succession of Government crises and staggering under the biggest military budget in their history , had looked forward to April 14 . That day , Japan 's leading soothsayers had declared , would be the luckiest in Japan 's year . The nation 's bamboo-stick-shufflers , temple oracles and stargazers all agreed on this point . <P> The happy day dawned . Through the town of Matsue in Shimone prefecture swept a raging fire which burnt to ashes more than 400 houses , a hospital , a school , many business offices , deprived 1,500 of their homes . Korea , Japan 's mainland dependency , was lashed by a storm which toppled 62 houses in the Keishonando district , lost eleven fishing boats near Fusan , bearing 70 fishermen . At Shingishu , Korea , 200 houses were washed away by floods . At Nagano , 20 persons were blown to bits by a fireworks explosion . Many mountain villages were wiped out by forest-fires between Kobe and Shimonoseki on the Empire 's main island . A cyclone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked communications . At Nagoya , a despondent Japanese supplemented the work of the elements by throwing himself under a freight train . He was killed , the locomotive and 16 cars were wrecked , traffic from Tokyo to Shimonoseki stood still .
