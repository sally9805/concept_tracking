Victor , the Russian valet , stepped back and proudly regarded his handiwork : Sergei Koussevitzky , the best-dressed man in Boston , imposing in cutaway and flowing black cravat . On Symphony Hall stage the players tuned to the oboe 's A , while Brahmins found their places . All stood when Koussevitzky entered , made his calm &; studied bow . When the first piece was over he did an unaccustomed thing . He grinned . To open the Boston Symphony 's 54th season Koussevitzky had chosen a rich , compact passacaglia which he had written himself . Bostonians had been curious . Koussevitzky , they knew , was the world 's greatest bull-fiddler . He could write sympathetically for the big bass , as Kreisler has written for the violin . For the Symphony 's 50th anniversary celebration he contributed an overture . But Boston was apathetic to a composer who at that time preferred to remain anonymous . When last week 's audience approved the passacaglia , prouder than Victor the valet was a plump motherly woman who by choice sits in the balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Albert , a shaggy mustache , high wing collars . She had stepped out of her class and married him , given him money to form an orchestra , tour the provinces and down the Volga . Exiled from Russia she helped finance him in Western Europe , became his shrewd self-effacing partner in a music-publishing concern which has sponsored the works of Stravinsky , Prokofiev , Scriabin , Rachmaninoff . Natalya Koussevitzky is rightfully proud of her husband 's U. S. achievements . He has polished Boston 's orchestra so that it again rivals New York 's and Philadelphia 's . He has given peerless performances of Ravel and Debussy , established himself as the greatest of U. S. program makers . Proud Bostonians have accepted him to the extent of making him a member of the Somerset Club , a Beacon Hill institution so exclusive that little Brahmins are usually registered for it immediately after birth . <P> Natalya Koussevitzky , obscure in her balcony seat , had her own feast-day coming . Two days after the Symphony opening came her 60th birthday . Koussevitzky , patterning himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , play an early-morning serenade to his good wife .
