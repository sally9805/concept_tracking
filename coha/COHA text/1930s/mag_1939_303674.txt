In the grim game of blockade and counter-blockade , which is Great Britain 's deepest strategy against Germany , Britain continued last week to score herself far ahead of the enemy with 338,000 tons of " contraband ' ' cargoes seized at control ports to 174,000 tons of shipping lost ( as of Oct. 17 ) . * Winston Churchill announced for his Admiralty , moreover , that 29,000 tons of enemy bottoms had been captured and 104,000 tons of new British ships brought into service . Convoys for British shipping were now organized in the Seven Seas . Across the Atlantic a series of radio patrols two hours apart was substituted for transoceanic convoys . S. S. Cameronia arrived " going from lamp post to lamp post " as her commander put it . <P> All of which annoyed Adolf Hitler , who last week called for fiercer action by his U-boats and Air Force to enforce his counter-blockade against Britain . Neutral ships were warned against joining Allied convoys . Scandinavians in the Baltic were advised to use the Kiel Canal to facilitate German search and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nazi planes to attack the Allied convoys , a new phase of World War II . In the first two encounters of this sort last week , British escort warships held the Nazis off with gunfire until British fighters could arrive from their land bases . Four Germans were reported shot down , the merchantmen untouched . <P> Meantime , as rescue ships reached port , stories of U-boat successes outside the convoy lanes continued to swell the grisly sea record . <P> &gt; Into Bordeaux steamed the U. S. Independence Hall with survivors of the City of Mandalay , which was torpedoed as she stood by to rescue survivors of the torpedoed Yorkshire after both ships got separated from their convoy . A U-boat had followed the Yorkshire all day . When the Independence Hall hove to for its double rescue , the U-boat surfaced and its commander , in excellent English , called " Thank you ! " He had killed 67 persons in sinking the two ships . <P> &gt; Mess-boy Frank Elders of the British freighter Heronspool described that ship 's running night fight with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub came up and it was so close that we could see men smoking in the turret . It looked as though we were looking right into the mouth of its gun . But when he fired , the shot fell a few yards short of us . ... We fired about eight shots at long intervals . Could n't do more because we could n't see her . <P> " I hung out near the gun and got the men coffee . That 's all I could think of doing . I heard somebody say ' Here he is ' and then came an explosion . Oh , mother ! I 'll never hear another like that . Our mainmast went down and the whole centre of the bridge and all the steering apparatus . <P> " The whole bow of the ship seemed to go up sky-high .

Same day the German tanker Emmy Friederich slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39,500 barrels of oil and a lot of livestock , lumber and cloth . She said she was bound for Malm , Sweden , but observers guessed she had a U-boat rendezvous .
