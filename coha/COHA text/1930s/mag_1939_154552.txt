As it must to all men , Death came last week to Wilford B. Smith , editor and publisher of the once-famed Pitchfork and a mighty man in North Texas . <P> Prodigiously built ( he was six feet four ) , prodigiously dressed ( in black suit , broad black hat and flowing black Windsor tie ) , a prodigious writer , talker , fighter and drinker , Pitchfork Smith worshipped at the shrine of one man and one man only : William Cowper Brann ( the Iconoclast ) . Once , on Brann 's birthday , his disciple got drunk , visited his grave at Waco , and sat there all night communing with the soul of his friend , for every drink he took himself pouring an equal amount of whiskey on the sod . <P> Son of a parttime minister and farmer of the Black Lands , Wilford Smith went to Dallas as a boy , attended a Moler barber college , graduated ( so he said ) cum laude . Back in his home county of Delta , he worked in a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became a country schoolteacher . Said he : " The only weak moment I ever had was when I played croquet with some old-maid schoolteachers , one of whom I married . " <P> Three years of teaching school netted him $90 , with which he started a weekly newspaper . When it folded , he sold books on the road for three more years , went to Kansas City , studied law , was admitted lo the bar . He quit the law because all the lawyers he saw were drunk and a newspaperman told him that if he wrote he would starve to death but , meantime , would always have a lot of fun . He founded a magazine called Plain Talk , which was suppressed for inciting race troubles . So he changed its name to The Pitchfork " because the pitchfork is the poor man 's implement ; you can fight with it or work with it . " When he was ordered never again to publish a political paper in Missouri he moved The Pitchfork to Dallas . Its first office was over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far for his news . <P> Famed throughout Texas grew Pitchfork Smith 's thunderous writings , his private battles , his oratorical eloquence . Old timers still quote from his street-corner oration on the death of John Barleycorn , the night before Prohibition took effect . One of his speeches ( " When You Die , Will You Live Again ? " ) was so highly esteemed by one P. S. Harris , president of Lucky Tiger Remedy Co. , that Mr. Harris gave The Pitchfork a lifetime advertising contract , reprinted the speech and sent copies to every barbershop in the U. S. <P> Excerpts : <P> " Is death a door or a wall ? ... I hear the Pagan maiden sing her wild love song until its wailing notes sweep the stars into one tear of pity for her breaking heart . But no answer comes . ... If this natural impulse to live after physical death can not be relied upon , then life itself is a myth and the starry blazonry of the midnight sky is a flaunting lie . .. . Nature is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for immortality can not be a colossal joke ! "
