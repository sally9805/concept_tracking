Adolescents who are yanked off to symphony concerts by culture-maddened parents often conceive a permanent dislike for symphonic music . Symphony boards of directors have long wondered how to make these adolescents take it and like it . Six years ago , Philadelphia 's platinum-blond Conductor Leopold Stokowski suggested a solution : make the parents stay away . Thereupon he started a series of " Concerts for Youth , " sold tickets to youth only ( between 13 and 25 ) , got " bouncers " to patrol the aisles of the staid Academy of Music with orders to throw out anyone who looked overage . <P> To his carefully selected audience Conductor Stokowski played full-weight symphonic programs . But he punctuated them with speeches , quips , unprogrammed surprises . He held conversations with them across the footlights , let them wriggle , whistle , cheer , shout , sing , throw paper darts . Once , when they dared him to , he brought down the wrath of Philadelphia 's Tories by playing the Internationale . Stokowski 's Youth Concerts became the most jam-packed events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sizable percentage of Philadelphia 's jitterbugs had been saved for Beethoven . <P> Last week Conductor Stokowski , back in Philadelphia on a return engagement , rounded out the sixth season of Philadelphia 's Youth Concerts .

Then , as one adolescent , the whole audience sang Ein ' feste Burg ist unser Gott , Schubert 's Ave Maria and a brand-new Philadelphia Youth Song to music by Sibelius . Maestro Stokowski called for more jive : " Let the walls rock and the ceiling move up and down , " he cried . " I want to see that chandelier agitated by its emotion ! "
