FOREHANDEDNESS NOTE : Surmising that it will he difficult to get hotel accommodations during World Fair time in 1939 , Dr. Myron I. Ingram , of Chicago , has made reservations . He has taken a double room with bath in the Belvedere , for himself and Mrs. Ingram . IN our Fliigelhorn story , of recent date , we confessed ignorance as to the origin of the " Whoa-hoho-ho . " Since then we have been catching up on our reading . Obviously the expression comes from the Swan of Avon himself , whose pre-Onyx Club play " The Merry Wives of Windsor " contains the line ( Act V , Scene 5 ) : SLENDER.  - -  - Whoa , ho ! ho ! father Page ! THE snow-shoveller we liked best during the recent ice age was the one on Forty-fourth Street between Fifth and Madison who managed to push his shovel out in front of him with one hand while holding a box of pencils out behind him with the other . He seemed to us a doomed man , caught between the rigors of municipal abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , speaking of abun- dance , Abundance House , at 41 East Twentieth Street , dedicated to the ideal of plenty for all , closed its doors on December 31st . The only thing there was plenty of was snow . THAT was a good letter of Thomas Jefferson 's which F.P.A. published in his column , in which Jefferson pointed out that there was nothing sacred about constitutions , and that they were useful only if changed frequently to fit the changing needs of the people . Reverence for our Constitution is going to reach droll new heights this year ; yet the Constitution , far from being a sacred document , is n't even a grammatical one . " We , the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union .. . " has turned many a grammarian 's stomach , perfection being a state which does not admit of degree . A meticulous draughtsman would have written simply " in order to form a perfect union " ? a thing our forefathers did n't dare predict , even for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Associated Experimental Schools last week . We did n't get to it because we had to stay home and get the knots out of a pair of shoelaces , but we were interested in one paragraph of the prospectus , which said : " We gauge our educational success by the richness of the children 's experiences rather than by the amount of factual information acquired . " That 's a good enough gauge , all right , provided an adult ever knows when a child is having a rich experience , which we doubt . We will bet the principal of P.S. 2 a licorice nigger baby that she was never aware of a single experience of ours that we remember as " rich . " Our rich experiences , as a child , were secret , unexpected , and unreported . Sometimes they were vaguely obscene and calamitous ; sometimes they were truancies of the mind dur ing periods of extreme academic drowse . We are fairly sure that nothing in our face or in our manner ever gave us away during the onslaught of a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , or troubled , or frightened , or amused ; but a teacher who thinks she knows when a pupil is having a rich experience is just kidding herself .

In last week 's issue of Mr. Gold 's paper there was a big announcement of a $1,500 prize contest , sponsored by the circulation department , with a first prize of $1,000 for writing a caption for a cartoon . " The contest is really a fascinating and easy game , " said the ad . " Do n't delay . Just think what you could do with $1,000 cash ! " This baffles us . What cart a New Masses winner do with a thousand dollars ? Get drunk at a Republican rally ? Buy some sound common stocks ? Are the editors trying to whet our greed , which is already so whet it drips ? We did n't realize that a Communist paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically it does n't admit exists , although we have suspected , from time to time , that our society might eventually be overthrown not by political zealots but by contest-answerers . If the Communists are looking for subscribers whose chief characteristic is an itching urge for a thousand dollars , then the new Communism is an awful lot like ol ' dehil capitalism . Anyway , we intend to enter the jousts , being a captionwriter ourself , and will donate our winnings , if any , to the Lighthouse for the Purblind , Motes and Beams Division . Prosperous AC CORDING to our Indianapolis correspondent , the State of Indiana has just celebrated Insurancel , Veek , with all sorts of organizations joining in testimonials to the benefits of insurance . The most convincing testimonial was that of a department store , which devoted a show window to a display of two rooms , one representing that of a poor widow left without insurance , the other that of a prosperous beneficiary . The surroundings of the poor widow were poor as poor , but the rich widow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds . Woo 's Weather THE other day we received a letter from an excited young lady in Bellaire , Long Island , telling us that her laundryman , one Ng Woo , of 211-49 Jamaica Avenue , predicts the weather , including the " color of the air . " More over , she told us , he writes his predictions on the typewriter and makes enough copies for the newspapers round about and for his customers . She suspected , she said , that he consults certain plants and two goldfish in getting up his reports . We put on our hat and went out to Bellaire . The confusion began when the laundry at the address given turned out to he operated by one Wing Sing ; his name was on the window . Through the glass we spied two goldfish in a bowl , looking neither mystic nor wonderful . We went in and found a short , roly-poly , gray-haired , bespectacled Chinese , busily ironing . We asked him if he was Wing Sing and if lie could direct us to Ng Woo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiably . " Ng Woo , myself . Wing Sing , busy name . Ng Woo , really name . Mclican easy say Wing Sing . Melican no easy say Ng Woo . " That seemed logical enough . We asked him if it was true that he predicted the weather , and he promptly handed us a typewritten sheet . It was headed : " The Weather Report Made by Ng Woo . Thirdty Days Long . Now . Who Can Be Dictum of Snows Fitingly First Day Explicate or Weather Progh . " That did not seem so logical . ( As a matter of fact , the last sentence was not cleared up while we were in the shop and will probably not be cleared up during our lifetime . ) We gradually gathered , however , that the predictions on the sheet were for the whole month , one line for each day . Here are a few of them , at random : " Fair , sky air yellow with white color , west north wind , " " Little cold frost early morning , east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudiness thwart the sunshine , burly cloud at evening , " " South wind in east , probably thundertimes thwart today . " That will give you the idea . Mr. Woo said lie has been getting out his weather reports for twenty years . He worked out his system from a Chinese calendar he fell to pondering twenty years ago . He explained the system to us . " Ten character in sky , five for earth , twelve for time , " he said . " East green color , south red color , west white color , north dark color , earth yellow color , sky blue color . Yellow air go up , get warm ; blue air come down , get cold . Different parts sky , some push this way , some push that way , ca n't catch much . " As simple as that . We asked Ng if he was the only person who knew the system . " I am head man , " he told us . We wanted to know if he ever consulted barometers , litmus paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between , whole go between , different , lots to do , take lots time , " he said coldly . That was his denial of the goldfish calumny . The prophet has run laundries for thirty years or more ( he 's fifty-seven ) , at one time in New York , where he also gave out typewritten weather reports . He has never charged a penny for them . He does it for the love of the thing . Outside his shop , we looked through the window at the goldfish . If one of them seemed to wink , it was doubtless purely an illusion . We were rather overwrought . The Niceties THE New York agents for Guin- ness 's Stout maintain a pretty firm stand on questions of morality . If you happened to see " The Puritan , " which opened ( and closed ) recently , you will remember that one of the scenes is laid in a rather questionable resort , with several of the characters lolling about and calling for Guinness . Well , the agency had agreed , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as soon as the Guinness officials got around to dropping in on a rehearsal , and saw how Guinness was involved in all these dubious goings-on , they cancelled the agreement . We saw their letter to the producers ; it said they just could n't go through with it , " in view of the character of the people ordering it and the circumstances under which they do so in the play . " Poet Wanted QEEMS like only yesterday that we 1 --  ) were telling you about Postal Telegraph 's new Personal Service and Information Bureau , but three years have gone by , and Mrs. Katharine Bleecker Meigs , the resourceful lady who runs it , has had lots of adventures since then . Freshest in her mind when we dropped in at 67 Broad Street to call on her was a telegram that had recently arrived from Florida , reading : " PLEASE SETTLE CONTROVERSY STOP WHO HAS SHAKEN HANDS WITH MOST CELE BRITIES ANSWER IN 24 HOURS . " Not knowing offhand , and being pressed for time , she dispatched simultaneous telegrams to Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes , asking each of them if he was the one . They all answered yes . This left things pretty much up in the air until somebody at the Postal office remembered Bill Egan , General Stationmaster of the Pennsylvania Railroad . It turned out that Mr. Egan was the most likely candidate , having been at the greeting job ever since the Penn Station was built , twenty-five years ago , though there are , of course , no statistics on handshaking ; his name was sent down to Florida . It cost the inquiring Florida party two dollars and sixteen cents , No charge for the four fruitless telegrams to Al Smith and the rest . Mrs. Meigs then had to stop talking to us for a while to tell some woman , by telephone : ( a ) That it is proper to wear an evening gown without a hat at an evening wedding . ( b ) That street clothes with a hat are all right for a very informal daytime wedding . ( c ) That you ca n't marry a divorced man in Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final decree . ( d ) That a Catholic priest will not perform a mixed marriage in church , certainly not when the groom has been divorced . ( e ) That it 's illegal to be married without a licence , even by a clergyman . We were rather puzzled as to how a person who did n't know about marriage licences did know about Postal 's information service ; Mrs. Meigs was n't puzzled , though  --  said people were always asking elementary questions about the wedding ceremony : which side of the church does the bride 's family sit on , which arm does a father give his daughter ? Sometimes they wait until the ceremony is just about to start , and then Mrs. Meigs has to answer by telephone in order to make the deadline with the information . This kind of defeats the purpose of a telegraph service bureau , but builds good will , she says . She makes no charge for giving information over the telephone . The demand for having Postal sing " Happy Birthday to You " to one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in New York . Regular messengers do the singing , and will do it in German , French , or Spanish without extra charge . At the moment , Postal is n't prepared to furnish escorts for the evening . They never really furnished them anyway , Mrs. Meigs told us ? just ordered them from an escort bureau . Even that has been d is-continued since a woman came in and complained that the gent she hired for New Year 's Eve had forced his way into her apartment , beaten her up , and stolen her jewelry . Now Postal wo n't transmit any requests for an escort unless the client is willing to accept an operative from the Burns Detective Agency . As we chatted , a telegram came to Mrs. Meigs ' desk , reading : " WANT POET As DINNER GUEST HE MUST WEAR DINNER CLOTHES AND ACT AS MY GUEST NOT EMPLOYEE MUST RECITE FROM HIS WORKS DURING EVENING WILL PAY UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS . " Mrs. Meigs said she 'd try to fill that order . A poet is a little different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , " she said , " is more like an entertainer . We fill lots of orders for entertainers . Only last night I sent three bagpipers to Yonkers . " Instructions AA DWELLER in a modest apart-ment building over near the East River has sent us his month 's rent receipt , which has printed on its reverse side a list of rules for tenants . He directed our attention to Rule 14 : " DO N'T ARGUE WITH THE JANITOR . " She-Money WE had a lot of two-dollar bills given us in change when we were up Boston way last summer ( just why , we never found out ) and we became interested in the denomination . Wondered about its being considered unlucky , for one thing , and when that started . A couple of numismatists we looked up have told us some facts . In the first place , nobody really knows just how or when two-dollar hills began to be looked upon as Jonalis , but the superstition is usually attributed to race-track men and is said to go hack about forty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a certain bookie who lost everything except his shoes on the horses and finally attributed his bad luck to having put up a two-dollar bill on a horse one day . That got around . Then we heard of a book called " Kentucky Superstitions " which touches on the subject , too , only it includes , among the original fraidycats , " saloonkeepers , railroad men , and waiters . " One expert we talked to said the uneasiness might be traced as far back as Pythagoras , who , some twenty-five hundred years ago , announced , " The number two is the symbol of diversity , of inequality , of division , and of separation . Two is an evil principle , a number of bad augury , characterizing disorder , confusion , and change . " The expert did n't say , though , how that would have come down through the ages to our racing stables and dicing rooms . As you may have heard , you can take the curse off a two-dollar bill by tearing a small piece out of one edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . A hundred years ago or thereabouts , we found out , before the national government standardized money , state banks used to issue all kinds of small bills  --  for $1.25 , $1.50 , $1.75 , $4 , $6 , $7 , $13 , and the like  --  often based on the whim of some bank president or other ( bank presidents were great cutups in those days ) . This practice flourished until the Civil War . After the government took over the currency , there was a general demand fur a three-dollar hill , and we came very near to having one . This near : Originally our smallest hills , the one and the two , were printed from the same plate . This piece of paper bore the numerals 1 , 2 , and 3 . Whichever numeral was circled in white represented the value of the bill . The 3 was never circled and , some time after the Civil War , was dropped finally . The two-dollar bill stayed on . It 's used mainly now by mills , factories , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . A paymaster who pays off , say , fifteen hundred persons snaking $12 a week saves himself fifteen hundred motions by reaching for a two instead of two ones . No bank will give you twos unless you ask for them . Practically nobody except a paymaster ever does . One reason , of course , is that they are easily confused with ones and handed out as such . For this reason two-dollar bills were once known to tellers as " she-money " ? that is , they confused you and cost you money . See ? We got much of our information from Mr. George H. Blake , who lives in Jersey City and is a numismatist of note . He served in the United States Treasury under McAdoo and while there started the government 's collection of old , large-size paper bills . The collection is worth $200,000 now and contains the last ten-thousand-dollar legal-tender note in existence  --  unless you have one tucked away in an uld sock . To get back to two-dollar bills : there were twenty and a half million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just about twenty-five times that many ones . Perfectly ectly Simple P-r HERE was quite a little corn motion in West Fifty-second Street one night last week , when a taxicab drew up in front of one of the elegant dives of the neighborhood with a young lady in evening clothes at the wheel , and in the hack seat her escort and the nominal driver of the cab . Most of the spectators suspected the trio of first-degree whimsy , shrugged , and passed by on the other side of the road . Fortunately , there was also present a Mr. Schuyler Watts , who was charitably willing to believe that the happening might have a rational , nonwhimsical explanation . After the couple had gone indoors , he questioned the cab-driver . It seems that the cab had got stuck on an ice floe over near the Waldorf , and none of the passing cars had been hardy enough to risk pushing it . The young lady 's escort had tried to push it by himself , but he was n't quite strong enough , so she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . The young lady had kept on driving after they got under way , because the lights were with her , and they were in a hurry . It was all as simple as that . The Beethoven Man WE went to see Artur Schnabel at the Ambassador last week , lured by the sheer magnitude of his self-imposed chore of playing the thirty-two Beethoven piano sonatas in Carnegie Hall on seven successive Wednesday evenings . Considerable mellowness , it turned out , lurks under a grim pedagogical exterior and austere platform manner . Though he is acknowledged to be the world 's greatest interpreter of Beethoven , and has in his active repertoire all of the master 's piano works except some unimportant juvenilia , it irks this grizzled Austrian to be extolled as a Beethoven specialist . " Frankly spoken , it iss my limidation that I play so much Beethoven , " he told us in a deep bass , gesturing with a long cigar . But he added blandly , " I am compledely happy in my one-sidedness . " He is startlingly short , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than it actually is . If you think he practices like a fiend between Wednesdays , you 're wrong ; en hour a day , or less , about hits it . He has played all the Beethoven sonatas since childhood , first getting his teeth into them during the six years ( age 9 to 15 ) which he spent with Leschetizky , the only formal teaching he ever had . This is the fourth time he has given this jumbo series , Berlin having heard it twice and London once . Germany brought out his edition of the scores of the thirty-two sonatas nearly ten years ago , and only last November he finished recording them all , in England . Mr. Schnabel wo n't express an opinion on the relative merits of the sonatas . " Each one iss a perfect work of genius " is all he 'll say . If you put great pressure on him , he 'll tell you that he considers the Opus 106 sonata the most difficult technically . He first came to America in 1922 , and thinks the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How ? " he had an answer all ready . " I see now , " he said , " a more idealisdic urge in the direction , so to say , of individualisdic differentiation . " We wrote that down carefully , and you might make a note of it yourself . Berlin used to be his home , but he left it in 1933 ( " In order to maindair solidarity with art , " he says diplomatically , when you mention Hitler ) . Since then he has lived in a villa on Lake Como , where he teaches an adoring circle of artist-pupils , some of whom are Americans . His wife , who did n't come with him this time , is Therese Behr , a noted Austrian contralto . Schnabel came over on the Ile-de-France , and it was one of those stormy winter crossings . He suffered acutely until the third day out , when , to his own surprise , he suddenly composed a couplet : " Every day the sailing rougher , people at the railing suffer . " Felt better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth Street and Fifth Avenue the other day , waiting for the green light , we heard in hack of us a pair of ladies muttering , mulling over some problem . Finally one of them said , in loud , ringing tones of decision , " Well , I 'd speak to her If that girl comes home every night torn and bedraggled , I 'd certainly speak to her ! "
