txt " Soap Bubbles . " If inflation does come out of the committee huddles and becomes the money policy , no one knows for certain what will happen . It might mean nothing more serious than the bank holiday of 1933 . Nobody from the President down to the $5 depositor knew what was going to happen then . To everybody 's surprise nothing happened and the credit for nothing was , in the general bewilderment , given to the All-American scapegoat , the great American peepul . For all we know the proposed inflation measures might be Vie solution of the bonus and farm finalicing . Still I say the hell with it . Inflation can never cure itself . Its greatest failure will be its success . If inflation succeeds at one problem , the American mind is so constituted that immediately inflation will be universally applied to every problem . ' Universal inflation ends with everybody having nothing . I learned that when I first blew soap bubbles . GEORGE CHAPLAIN . Sag Harbor , N. Y. , Feb. 2 , 1936.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
