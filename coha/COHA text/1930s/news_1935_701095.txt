txt The recent demoralization In the raw cotton market has brought to a head efforts being made by the cotton textile industry to obtain government sanction for the industry 's own plans for meeting a growing emergency . Conferences are being held with the National Industrial Recovery Board and within the industry to determine on a policy of action . Never has the industry been so beset by such a tangled combination of troubles . Mills have been operating in the red since last July selling below coat because the consumer would not pay higher prices due to processing taxes and wage increases . The smash in raw cotton further weakened goods prices and stopped buying but spot cotton for actual use held firmly at 12 cents , the government loan price , ( plus 4.2 cents a pound tax or 16 cents to the mill ) . Due to the apparent peg many mills did not hedge their inventories and are now faced with serious losses on their stocks . And Japan is eating steadily into both export and home markets . What Industry Wants To meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct overcapacity by spreading business and employment over the mills in any specified group according to a pre-arranged plan . At present there is widespread but uneven curtailment in many branches of the industry , with some mills shut down . others running two or three days a week and others running nearly full . Under Section 6 of the cotton code , the Code Authority has the right temporarily to reduce machine hours in groups of mills where needed . The leading factors in the industry propose to invoke this provision in this way . Each division will meet and determine the proper rate of machine hour operation for its group . Then upon vote of say 80% of this group a general rate of operation would be declared mantstory. spreading business and , employs ... ? , " verily among the group . This plan is clesignentoss temporary measure to meet the present emergency pending more fundamental remedial action in Washington . It is not designed to increase the present curtailment but to apron out both the curtailment and the activity evenly over the industry . A meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible the needs and desires of this particular group of mills Other meetings will probably be held later to work out additional plans . The situation in the industry is obvious from the fact that domestic consumption of cotton decreased 14% in 1934 from 1933 . Consumer resistance has met an advance of over 100% in the cost of cotton and 70% in labor costs . The Last Straw The straw that has finally broken the camel 's back , however , is a startling intensification of Japanese competition that has become increasingly evident in recent months . The ' United States already has lost its two principal export markets , the Philippines and Cuba to Japan , and while actual Imports into this country are small they are growing alarmingly . In addition they are demoralizing to the price structure , particularly in colored goods and bleached goods . Our cotton goods export business declined last year about 60% , and although it is normally only about 7% of the total volume of the industry its loss seriously upsets balance . It is estimated that normally about 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottons , but now more than half of these are out of work . It is proposed by the industry that an immediate quota be placed upon Japanese goods based on a five-year average as one measure for helping employment . Opinion in the industry is not in favor of reducing wages or working hours , or of cutting the price of cotton or depriving the farmer of help , but it is widely felt that the processing tax has been proved a disastrous failure and that it must be eliminated and replaced by other means of relief .
