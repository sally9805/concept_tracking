Gloom descended on U. S. gunners last year when the Government cut the wild-fowling season down to 30 days ( TIME , Sept. 7 ) . The Government 's unanswerable reason was that Drought had decimated the flocks in their northern breeding grounds . Sportsmen , fearful lest a temporary measure for conservation be transformed by sentimentalists into a permanent prohibition , held long discussions , seeking a positive remedy which would bring back the birds and the long shooting season ( in most States three months ) . <P> Last week , after three months of debate , the sportsmen were agreed on their remedy . Introduced in the House by Congressman John W. McCormack of Massachusetts was a bill to raise $7,000,000 a year through a 1 tax on shotgun shells , most of the revenue to be spent to conserve and increase U. S. waterfowl . <P> Problem . The wild fowl shortage is the accumulated effect of several bad breeding years . The U. S. Bureau of Biological Survey has been singularly vague about the actual effect , in numbers of birds and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the birds hardest hit were canvasbacks , redheads and lesser scaups . Pintails , mallards , black ducks and geese were little below normal . Low water concentrated what birds there were in the good feeding grounds , causing many shooters to doubt that a shortage existed . Bureau agents found such concentrations in Florida 's " panhandle " district , in the Crane Lake area of Illinois , along Missouri 's Sheridan River . Southern California 's flight , usually 40 miles wide , was ten miles last year . Little affected by Drought were areas on Puget Sound , the Columbia River , the Susquehanna flats , and Long Island . Last year 's curtailed season , believed to have reduced the kill from nearly 18 to seven million birds , may result in a longer season next autumn , but this is doubtful . This year the Department of Agriculture plans to purchase or lease some 40,000 acres for six sanctuaries , has begun by acquiring 2,274 acres on Long Island ( near Hewlett ) . <P> Remedy . When the American Game Conference met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two opposing factions . The American Game Association wanted a $1 Federal hunting license ( " Dollars for Ducks " ) . The More Game Birds in America Foundation favored a 1 tax on shells ( " Pennies for Ducks " ) . Outvoted by an arbitration committee , the Game Association last week was prepared to support the 1 tax plan . So were several smaller organizations , Outdoor Life and other magazines . <P> The tax would be paid by the manufacturer or seller ( of imported shells ) on shells for 410-gauge guns and larger . Each box of shells would bear a stamp . One cent would be added to the retail cost of each shell . Proponents of the McCormack bill estimated that at least $7,000,000 would be raised annually . Of this sum , 5% would be used for Federal research , administration and law enforcement . The remainder would be apportioned as follows : to the States 55% for increase and protection of all game and for refunds to trapshooters ( apportionment among the States to be based on the number of hunting licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45% to increase waterfowl by enlarging breeding , refuge and concentration areas .
