Week after week , month after month , Eastman employes all over the world sell Kodak films and cameras , smile politely at squinting family groups , light-struck negatives , the round bottoms of infant sons . But most of them still take photographs in their spare time . To encourage them the paternal Eastman Co. holds an annual exhibition and gives prizes for the best photographs by its 23,500 employes . To Rochester last week for the ninth time went the favorite prints of 500 Kodak employes in 21 countries . A distinguished jury walked solemnly down long galleries of exhibits , conferred , then awarded the Eastman Gold Medal to Ralph J. Fallert of Chicago for a misty study of coal elevators and chimneys entitled " Towers of Industry . " The Sulzer cup for the best portrait went to another Chicagoan , John W. Zarley for a picture of a smiling gentleman in a derby sucking a pipe .
