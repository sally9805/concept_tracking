On the 67th floor of the RCA Building in Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center is the breezy Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club . There one sweltering day last week , after a few rounds of cool Budweiser , some 35 financial newshawks sat down at a long table as the guests of Robert Ralph Young , amiable spokesman-member of the trio which bought control of the Van Sweringen railroad empire from George A. Ball , the Muncie , Ind . fruit-jar tycoon ( TIME , May 3 ) . It was quiet Mr. Young who described himself and his two partners-Allan P. Kirby and Frank F. Kolbe-as " just babes in the woods . " Last week the " Babes " started out of the woods . Before the luncheon in Rockefeller Center the directors of Alleghany Corp . and The Chesapeake Corp. , most substantial trees in the dark forest of Van Sweringen holding companies , met in Mr. Young 's swank Park Avenue apartment , voted to merge the two in a new Chesapeake Corp . ( no " The " ) . * <P> Originally the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was the company the " Babes " bought from old Mr. Ball . But of the two , Chesapeake had a far better name with the public , and Messrs . Young , Kirby &; Kolbe have demonstrated an uncommon flair for public relations . To newshawks last week Mr. Young handed photostats of the chart used by the Wheeler committee during the Washington hearings on the Van Sweringen empire . Through all holding companies which have been , or would be , segregated or eliminated on completion of the Alleghany-Chesapeake merger , Mr. Young had drawn heavy black lines . Crossed out were 17 non-railroad holding companies and Midamerica Corp. , the tiptop unit set up by Mr. Ball . Today The Chesapeake Corp . owns about 35.5% of the stock of Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Co. , and Alleghany owns 71% of the stock of The Chesapeake Corp . After the merger new Chesapeake Corp . will be the holding company for all the railroad properties , only one step removed from the rails . <P> As far as old Chesapeake is concerned , the merger offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its shareholders will be offered the choice of either one and one-half shares of the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Co. common stock , the holding company 's principal asset , or one share of a prior preferred stock in the new company . Alleghany 's capitalization is more complicated-common stock , two issues of preferred , three bond issues . Two of the bond issues will be assumed by the new company . Holders of the third issue , the famed 5s of 1950 , will be offered $200 in cash , $800 in preferred stock of the new company for each $1,000 bond . Holders of Alleghany prior preferred will be offered $7.50 in cash and one-half a share of new prior preferred . For Alleghany 's old preferred , which owes approximately $34 per share in accumulated back dividends , one new share of non-cumulative preferred will be offered , together with warrants to buy new common at $5 per share . Alleghany common will be swapped share-for-share for new Chesapeake common . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
