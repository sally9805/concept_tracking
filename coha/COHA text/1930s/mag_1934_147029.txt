" We 're broadcastin ' our spiritual exercises . . . . Remember , words are the spirit , the very spirit of life . No matter how big and strong the body may be physically , it 's dead without the spirit . When a man pulls a gun and says ' Run , ' the word ' run ' with the knowledge of the gun does you a spiritual wrong . For , as a man thinketh , so is he . . . . Whatsoever is true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report-If there by any virtue , think on these things . . . . " <P> Amen . . . . Yassuh . . . . Praise de Lawd . <P> " The sun is shinin ' . The birds are singin ' . They 're not complainin ' ' bout the depression . Why should we ? " <P> Ai n't dat de truth ! ' ' Then sing , brethren and sisters . " Praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . A men ! <P> Such devotional exercises , interspersed with a rollicking theme hymn called " Happy Am I , " have become familiar to many a U. S. radio listener during the past year . Broadcast from Washington over the CBS network every Saturday night , the Church of God of Elder Solomon Lightfoot Michaux is a lively Negro romp , noisy and syncopated as some white folks believe all black worship should be . Last week for the first time Elder Michaux took his choir of 40 and his jazz orchestra of ten out of Washington to capitalize their fame . For his first appearance he chose stolid Philadelphia . <P> When Elder Michaux advertised for 100 female ushers , 4,000 girls , black and white , applied . When he opened his twelve-day revival in Philadelphia Arena , some 5,000 persons of both colors elbowed in . They bought programs , contributed to a collection . Stocky , gold-toothed and grey-haired , Elder Michaux introduced himself as " The ' Happy Am I ' preacher , " launched into a sermon praising President Roosevelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored the NRA BlUb Eagle . I sponsor the NRA White Eagle . The difference is that the first stands for National Recovery Administration while mine stands for National Revival Administration . Any doctor will tell you that you ca n't have recovery without revival . The same is true of our country . ' ' The audience cried " Amen ' ; and " Yeah , man . " When Elder Michaux bellowed that " the Devil is right here in Philadelphia and we are going to get him , " they stomped their feet and swung into " Happy Am I. " <P> In many ways Elder Michaux resembles Harlem 's Major J. ( " Father " ) Divine ( TIME , Aug. 7. et seq . ) . Each declines to tell his age . Each performs good works among poor Negroes . Each lulls his followers with a catchword ( Father Divine 's : " Peace , It 's Wonderful ' ' ) . Each preaches a warm , rambling theology . But Elder Michaux makes no claim to divinity . Once a fish peddler in Norfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington in 1929 to found the Church of God under the Gospel Spreading Association . A small Alexandria radio station , WJSV , began picking up his services . When CBS absorbed WJSV , Elder Michaux was the only feature retained for the chain .
