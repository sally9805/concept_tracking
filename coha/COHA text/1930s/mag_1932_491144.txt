I told him I was on my way to Wall Street to - talk to a few multimillionaires , in the hope of getting harrowing statistics . You make a colossal mistake in going- to Wall Street . after stories . Those you will hear there will he too samey . A still greater mistake is to think that t he men you ought to interview are the millionaires . In a rapidly growing country , like the United States or the Argentine , rich men are not necessarily wise men . Personally , I have found the contrary more apt to be the case . In old , civilized countries , like England or France , a man has to be unusually able to become a millionaire , because there is so much competition and he is not helped by the growth of a country that long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate , or by any of the many factors that make money-making in the United States a relatively easy and rapid process . Because we are still engaged in establishing the routine of civilization , a man of no particular ability may become a millionaire not only in a short time but quite often in spite of himself . We all know that type of rich man . " When Little Knowledge Was Profitable " TN WALL STREET , much of the money has been I made by lucky plunges , and the wise man is never one to plunge blindly . He sees the dangers too clearly to ignore them : knows too much to have the courage of ignorance . How many business men do you personally know who have made money at . times by not being ' businesslike , by disregarding the voice of experience , by doing what no wise man would dream of doing , even though his friends call it nerve ? How many people do you meet every day who tell you that all they ask is to get the breaks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study to their problems ; and yet many of them make money . I know intimately a dozen multimillionaires , perhaps more , and only two of them are what I would call wise . Listen to the others and you will find that not one in twenty can generalize accurately . The Wall Street Napoleons are more like Murat than like the great Emperor . They can lead a cavalry charge fearlessly , but they can not determine principles and rules for the conduct of their ticker operations , as Napoleon did for the art of war . " You must not lose sight of the fact that during the late bull market the large winnings were made by people who did not know enough about stock speculation to fear the consequences of paying fool prices for stocks . For many months , suckers , rich and poor , to whom the game was a matter of luck , disregarded values and grew rich and richer . Why not , when what was chiefly needed then was blindness ? If you can not see the top , you are bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . The less wise the market players were in ' 28 and ' 29 , the richer they became . Of course , what made t hem rich then was precisely what later made them poor . It took brains , knowledge and character to cash in . Why talk to the millions who did n't cash in ? " You will tell me that what I say goes for reckless speculators . As a matter of fact , it does n't . The conservative rich did not gamble . They did nothing at all . What millions they made during the boom came from merely keeping what , stocks they had held for years . When they found it paid beyond their wildest dreams to do as the mob did , they modestly concluded that they and not the mob must be wrong . They continued to grow richer by the minute because they kept on breathing . Not having bought for the rise , they felt no compulsion to sell for the fall. - In other words , guilty of the oldest of all sucker plays in thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . It is perfectly plain than a mind of that type may be trusted to function the same way throughout the life of the owner thereof . A man who can see no top can see no bottom . Having held on throughout the bull market , they held on throughout the bear market . Today they are the mob . Persistence is an admirable trait , particularly if you drop overboard and insist upon sinking until yOU can touch bottom  --  at fifteen fathoms . " I see these men every day . Sometimes I can not help lunching with some of them . My early training compels me to listen politely to them . I can not tell you how often I have to pine ) myself to make myself realize that these men are considered able by the public that reads the newspapers . Earnings meant nothing to the Great American Public during the boom . They mean nothing now . The state of mind being the same , I he rich players who refused to sell out stooks that returned less than 2 per cent per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 or 12 per cent . There is the same disregard of essentials . Friends who sneered at you when you told them to take their profit . in ' 28 and ' 29 , now threaten you with bodily violence if you offer to give them a list of bargains to buy . Same poor men . Same millionaires . Same wisdom . Where is your story ? I and not cynical . If I know any class at all well , it is the Wall Street crowd ; not the pikers , but the talent .. Sup-pose you disregard the majori ty and consider the bright bunch . Al-most every stockbroker has been complaining that he can not induce his custom ers to buy anything . Well , the so-called leaders have not been a bit braver or wiser . " I say that I have rather specialized on rich men because I know h urn dreds of them ? all sorts of millionaires in every section of this country of ours . Few of them are all-round men . Those whom we may call able have usually succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another , with a genius for detail , may be too much of a penny pincher ever to succeed greatly . Another may understand salesmanship and not production . There are speculators Who know the psychology of stock traders bu t lack that sense of timeliness without which stock-market battles are invariably lost . That is why , in the.present depression , so many millionaires have lost so many of their millions and why so few of them can tell you the reason . It is too unflattering to themselves . " Anybody can give you dozens of stories of men who made large fortunes during the boom and knew enough to cash in before the crash , but bought cheap stocks in 1930 and sold those cheap stocks at tremendous losses in 1931 : Take the case of our mutual friend , William Martin . He is a very decent . chap , w one of those competent executives who are written // smiled  --  until the crash . But Martin had several millions to his credit at his bank . Now , uninvested money is a very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after the break , was still too high , and intelligently refused to buy it . He could n't see that it was cheap on a 5 per cent basis because it had once sold on a 1 per cent basis . But the price sagged and finally it reached alevel at which the stock netted the holder better than S per cent per annum . He bought a very large block of it , paid cash and put it away . No margin nonsense for him .. " The price continued to decline as business fell off more and more . When the stock sold at . a price that would return 12 per cent , Martin took on 10,000 shares more . He had to put up his other stock as collateral , for he had used all his cash . You can guess the rest . In 1031 the stock made new lows  --  and finally sold on a 20 per cent basis . Martin had no more - margin to put up and he was sold out 1 ) y his bank . That is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sensible . Today he thinks the worst is yet to come . fie means , for all his friends to lose all their money . In protecting themselves , the a loan secured by some thousands of shares of a stock that was listed on the New York Stock Exchange . The borrower was the president of the corporation , who had bought the stock because it . was cheap . He lived in the town where the company 's chief plant was . The New York bank refused . make the loan . But knowing that the president 's block of stock was hanging over the market , the New Yorkers called in some of their own loans that had some of the same stock as collateral . The price , of course , The High Cost of Being Human particularly i they made money doing it . When the stock was obviously selling way beyond its value , Martin advised his staff to get out . Take your profit now . - We 'll never earn enough to pay dividends that would return more than 1 per cent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down again . ' But you know how it is . They were all thinking not of the earnings but of advances ; their eyes were on the tape , not on the future . And the tape said : ' No top ! ' " Martin himself got out ; he sold every share he owned . He saw it go higher and his friends banks have made recovery difficult by depriving people of the ammunition to : fight with when the tide of battle turns . I can not tell you how many insiders lost in 1931 all they had made in the boom  --  and a little more when the banks sold out their collateral , especially bonds . They will never come back . They are down-and-outers . " Of course , many of the stories you hear are rather unpleasant . You ca n't tell what may happen to a millionaire these days . In the old days they were safe , whatever happened . The president of a corporation in a good-sized city came to New York to borrow some money from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials did not tell him that they did not care to lend him any money . Instead they asked for a statement . They saw , among other items , " NA TELL , knowing what I did and feeling as I felt , ff V how did I manage to lose four-fifths of my for-tune ? Because I am a human being , like hundreds of other helpless millionaires who can not , perform surgi-cal operations on themselves . There was my business . It had made me a great deal of money in the past and probably will make money for me in the future . since it . is neither an obsolete nor an obsolescent . industry , like so many others . I , therefore , had my own future to consider in the light of the past and , having done so , I held on . I am paying for doing the only thing I could do  --  for considerin4 my organization , my part-ners , my hundreds of employes . It is easy to say that I could have gone out of business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and sleep . Most of my capital is invested in my business . My other assets are in securities . They were as good as any other securities at t he time I bought I hem . There was no reason to sell them if I could not buy better ones . I 've always owned securities . This time I should have had none . A fairly common millionaire 's mistake , of the - vintage of 1931 .. " Take my house . I have devoted much time , money and study to the development of my place . It has given me great . plea-sure . I did it out of in-come . In the course of twenty years , the total spent on it is quite large , Now it costs me considerable to keep it up . The cost of living has decreased much more for the poor man than for the chap with a la re .. - , e house . It takes a Mt le less to feed my help , but I have not reduced their wages . The reason I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what money I might save that way would be too little to compensate me fur the discomfort that a. sense Of grievance on the part of my help would visit on me . I use money to buy comforts ; and , of all places , I must be most comfortable in my own home . And the grounds have to be kept up , because what I would save by discharging a couple of gardeners , I would lose in the depreciation caused by the slovenly appearance of an u rider-manned place . Of course I should have moved to a cheaper plane and saved considerable money , but who does that until all his money is gone ? It is not . true economy to stop spending money when you have none to spend , and that is the only economy most of us pract ice . Undoubtedly , t he inability of millions of Americans to adjust themselves instantly to changed conditions and to make their budgets balance is responsible for many hardships today . After all , the rich man and the poor man are alike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . The average attitude toward money changes too gradually to be of help in a crisis . " Finding Comfort in Poverty " That is why I am still spending too much , though I fully realize that the man who spends too much is bound to pay for it sooner or later . My business shows a deficit , though I am proud to say that it is proportionately a smaller deficit than most of m3 , , competitors can show . But I keep my office going at the expense of my diminishing capital . My personal expenses are less because I have stopped collecting for the time being . We poor rich are growing poorer . Of course being poor of ter having been rich does not hurt as much as the poor , who have never been rich , imagine . Millionaires who have been wiped out in 1931 will testify that after months of fearing the worst , the final Wow brought them a sense of relief rather than of ruin . The suspense was over ; the tortures of uncertainty were ended . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that they are poor . Nobody is as rich as he was two years ago . It does not matter whether we measure wealth , American fashion , by the market value of the estate , or by the more logical English fashion  --  that is , by the yearly income . All of us are poorer . Not all of us are wiser . Write about the real reason for the depression . Never mind who lost money . Stick to why . " Notwithstanding my friend 's warning , it seemed to me natural to assume that today 's big losses would be found where yesterday 's big winnings were . For more than two years Wall Street has been losing almost . without interruption . Speculators and investors , customers and brokers , borrowers and hankers , all have suffered . Of course one does not have to go to the financial district to find lame ducks . I called on broker after broker . All of them reported juicy deficits . The working forces had been cut in half and still the offices were overmanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the recent mergers of brokerage firms as well as about other mergers that didn'tgo through ; and why they did n't . There was no business , everybody said , and overhead and inventory were eating them up , to say nothing of the shrinkage in assets due to the slump in all securities . The senior partner of one of the most prosperous of all the commission houses , a friend of many years ' standing , told me : " Well , I shall not have to pay any income tax for 1931 . " " But you own a nice collection of stocks and bonds , outside of your interest in the firm , " I reminded him . " Oh , yes . We made a lot of money during the bull market and my personal estate increased somewhat in those fat . years , but my share of my firm 's loss this year more than offsets the income from my private investments . Where re were borrowing S2.50 , - 000,000 at one time in 1929 , we are now borrowing , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 help in our various offices two years ago , we are carrying about 800 on the pay roll ; and we could do with less than 500 , with the little business we are doing . Do n't print . that you saw me burst into tears , but. , honestly , my holidays are embittered , not by the knowledge that we ran our business at a loss this year , but because I do n't see how we can help letting some more of our help go . NN'e have had to reduce some salaries and We give some of the boys a week 's vacation without pay once a month ; but . having to tell them at this time that we have to let more of them go is tough . You hear a great deal about the wickedness of Wall Street . Suppose you now print the truth about the way practically every commission house for two years has carried men on the pay roll at a. serious loss , not because we had to keep up the organization , but because we didn't. want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years to spare , I would tell you about one-thirtieth of the tales of woe that 1 can personally vouch for . " . " I 'll listen to one , " I said . An Exception to the Rule " One of our best customers is Tom Parsons , the vice president of a company . He has traded in this office for years . He is an extremely able , self-made man with a most extraordinary faculty of never deceiving himself about the ability or his associates , no matter how famous they may ' be . He appraises all men at . their exact value . This keeps him from thinking too much or too little of his advisers and compels him to concentrate on the advice . He is very far from being- a gambler . I dare say that , strictly speaking , he is not really a speculator , but having no illusions about men or things and no dollar fears , he always has adequate reasons for trading . " Just . about the time the bull market started he came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . He told me that he was convinced that we were about to go into the biggest . boom in the history of the United States , and gave me his reasons . I held the same views . He told me he wanted to buy as much of his own stock as he could carry . As a rule , company officials who take flyers in the stock market are seldom as bullish on their own stock as they are on outside ones on which they get hot tips instead of exact statements of earnings . They prefer to get their stock-market information at second hand . Apparently aman may be so closeto his own apple that he sees all the spots and specks on it unduly magnified . I could tell you a dozen stories about presidents of corporations who can not , see any reason why their stocks should advance without especial developments in the business . They blame it on manipulation by pools and allow rank outsiders to skim all the cream . Tom Parsons was an exception to that rule . " Getting Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his company 's stock . He bought intelligently , being neither overeager nor overcautious . He told me , when he gave me his first . order : If we are going to have the boom , as I feel certain we will , I can not see what is to stop our stock from going up with the rest of the market .. We certainly will get our share of the business and perhaps a little more , because we operate in territory that has all sorts of boom possibilities . And I 'd like you to bear in mind , before we start , that everything in this world , including a bull market. , has an end . Business is bound to go sour after a period of prosperity . When that time comes , I don't. want to be long of any other stock than the only one that I know all about .. That will enable me to act in accordance with conditions that always determine the actual value of all stocks . It . is the only way to operate intelligently . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I propose to be long of my own stock and of nothing else . I know there is going to be big money in lots of other stocks , but I shall stick to my own . ' " I call that an intelligent , businesslike attitude . Ile bought his 10,000 shares around 38 . The boom came , as he had foreseen ; and stocks rose , as he had predicted . He watched closely the trend of general business for the warning bell . As prices rose he began to pyramid in the same intelligent , conservative way , always keeping one eye on the stock market and two on his own company 's earnings . Every time there was a five or ten point dip he bought a little more . Finally he had quite a. large block . " One day , early in 1928 , Parsons came to me and told me he was getting out . " What 's the matter ? ' I asked . " I There is trouble ahead , ' he answered , ' and I can not see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . Close out . my entire line . ' " ' But the market is sure to go higher , ' I said . ' Why do n't you sell a part and hold the rest ? ' " ' It is altogether likely that you are right , ' he said . myself think there is no doubt that . the market , is going somewhat higher , but how much neither you nor anyone else can tell . As for myself , I see the danger signal and I am not going to run past it . I bought this line of stock because I saw good business ahead for this country . Now I see the reverse . If it . was a wise and logical thing for me to buy when I did , it is equally wise and logical for me to sell now . ' " I could not move him . As a. matter of fact , I did n't try , because lie certainly knew what his company was doing , and if he could see the beginning of a recession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He closed out his entire line at a profit of very nearly $2,000,000 . The stock , after hegot out , continued to mount . Men in this office who did n't begin to know about the company 's business and prospects what Parsons did , stayed with the stock and made much more money than he had . As a matter of fact , some of his friends , who had bought the stock on his advice , used to josh him when the price rose 30 points above what Tom got out at . They took particular pleasure in telling him what . their profits were , day after day . But all he would say was : ' I 've got mine in cash . Yours is on paper . Something is bound to happen . Watch out ! Nothing goes so quickly as paper , once it starts . Gasoline is n't in it with it . ' " But for all his talk , the market kept on rising by leaps and bounds . Public and great bull operators alike could see nothing but high.er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made more millions  --  of the highly inflammable kind , as it . turned out . But Parsons ' friends , who had made more millions by not selling when he did , with all his financial savvy and cleverness and inside dope , continued to tease him .. I remember at our luncheon club one day , one of the big winners  --  on paper  --  told Parsons : Torn , you have no business being vice president of your company . That job ought to be filled by a. man of vision . Somebody who looks ahead . ' It I am looking ahead . That 's why I. see what 's there . You fellows ca n't , because you 've got several thicknesses of paper profits in front of your eyes . One of these days we 'll find out . who was blind . ' ' ' Cashing In on Bargain Day " The market continued to go still higher . Parsons told me that more than once he was tempted to sell his stock short , but he decided against ' feeling for the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most expensive practiced by stock speculators . It . has busted some of the greatest . It caused more fatalities than all other practices in 1927 , 1928 and 1929 . Ask the bears that went broke . " ' A man may sell too soon , of course , and miss some of the rise , as I did , ' Parsons explained , but that . wo n't hurt him if his selling is profit-taking . But if I sell short too soon , it may cost me more than I care to pay . Anyhow , I should n't want it known that I am short of my own stock . It would n't sound well , no matter how wise that market position might be . But let me ask you this : If my company did not earn 5 per cent on the stock in a booming business year like 1927 , why should it earn more this year or next , when business falls off , as it already has begun to do ? Pass that on to your customers . They wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blame themselves and not their broker ; " The big crash came in 1929 . Tom Parsons was one of the few men in this office , out of our hundreds of customers , who was able to buy cheap stocks on those terrible days when there were absolutely no bids for many of the issues on the list . He was n't bullish , but bought for a turn .. I think we bad about 81,000,000 in margins from him ; " He had figured on the rally . and he held on to his stock until the spring of 1930 . That was the time when the guided tried to make a bull market . It was then , when hull talk was once more heard in the hind , that Torn Parsons sold out  --  at a profit of about S1,000,000 ? t he line that he had bought in the November break . A few weeks later he went short of two or three market leaders . The rally had not run its course and the market went . against him for a while . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shorts and cleaned up another 51,000,000 . " I tell you all this in detail merely to prove that Parsons is an exceptionally wise bird . In this office he made and kept : : , s2,000,000 in the bull market . He was wise enough not to feel for the top , which , as it turned out , would have been an expensive experiment . lie had brains and boldness enough to buy in the 1929 crash and gumption enough to cash in on the rally the following spring with another s1,000.000 profit ; and then he cleaned up anot her 51,000 , - 000 on the short side . Valuable versatility ! It is obvious that . he had wisdom and vision , experience and nerve above the average . Also , I would have you especially note that he was no hog , which should have made him a non-losing animal in ' any business . " It will now interest you to know that since March , 1931 , Parsons has lost 55,000,000 in the stock market . No , not on paper ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How did he come to do that ? " I asked the broker . " I asked Parsons the same question , and he answered : ' I have no alibi . I knew well enough that there was no boom coming . I was as sure as anyone could be that we had a long , hard row to hoe ahead of us . But I thought , months ago , that prices had discounted all that . In particular was I convinced that the moving-picture shares had overdiscounted it . I was after bargains . The time to buy stocks has always been when nobody wants them . And the Lord knows nobody wanted them last spring ! I followed a rule that always had made money for me . I went through the list and found excellent reasons for not buying most stocks . Unfortunately , I happened to spend several weeks in Washington , D. C. , on an Interstate Commerce Commission case . I forgot that the Government always works full time at full wages and that its employes , who constitute the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went to t he movies and round them crowded .

But it . did not occur to me that while movie places might . be crowded in Washington they might not be crowded anywhere else . ' " From Rags to Riches and Back " Parsons took his 55,000,000 loss some time ago . It nearly cleaned him out . With what money he had left . we bought good safe bonds for him . " ' If bonds like these are not worth more than I am paying for them , ' I remember his telling me , ' then stocks are worth nothing . Bear market or not. , stocks must be worth something ! ' " Well , since that time some of his bonds have sold for much less than he paid for them a few months ago , and a. certain stock that is paying dividends at the rate of six dollars a year sold today at $4.25 a share .

" The head of a commission house that once honored itself by occasionally accepting small orders from me knew what . I was seeking even before I spoke . He shook my band as warmly as though I were still a customer , and said : " I was thinking of you today because I ran across three ex-Napoleons of Wall Street whose names and deeds tilled the pages of the newspapers when everybody was getting rich .

All the plungers together of the great McKinley boom that ended with the Northern Pacific . panic in 1901. did n't make as much money as some of these chaps of whom nobody ever heard before 1927 . They ran the winnings of their cliques into incredible sums . They bought and paid for country estates and yachts and town houses . Today everything is gone  --  even the fame . " . , 07 Midas of the Bull Market " You remember all the talk about . the Day of the Common Stock ? Well , one of the most successful of all the young financiers , who used to tell conservative brokers that they were obstacles to progress and a brake on prosperity , is really very clever and persuasive . " He began bulling stocks at the very start of the biggest bull market in history . His success was sensational . From the first . until he became one of the , partners of a banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every rung , somebody said , represented 51,000,000 . He persuaded the firm to form an investment trust because it was a crime not to capitalize their well-established reputation as careful bankers . It would make the firm more important . and increase the number of contented customers by being up-to-date .. " Bolton , the young financier , seems really to have had a genius for stocks . His vast . inexperience in stock-market matters was no handicap to him in the bull market . The way he piled up millions for his pools and his firm was talked about in the best banking circles as well as in envious commission houses . Probably the very brilliancy of his spectacular success is what . ruined him . Every stock he bought proceeded to go up as though its one aim in life were to please him . In the course of time the buying price got to mean nothing to him . You really ca n't blame him ; in the stock market his purchases had been so uniformly profitable . Presently his partners perceived there would be money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buyers all ready to buy . They acquired a company at a ridiculously high price , but sold it to their investment trust at still higher figures . Bolton was neither a merchant nor a promoter , but he did not have a clear notion of what he was n't , because so many people wanted to make millions betting as he advised that they made him think he was everything . He began to buy plants and businesses inst old listed stocks . He was out of his element there . " He had a knack of making friends and it . was easy for him to become one of the pets of the president of a large stock-market bank in New York . He did it by buying many thousand shares of the bank 's stock at the highest price ever recorded for it . It is still the high record . Of course , he had no trouble in convincing the president of that . bank that he was a- shrewd judge of values , because anybody who could pay such a price for that bank stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual man .

Nobody believed then that a day of reckoning would come and that the day would be more than 20,000 hours long . How much over , nobody call yet tell ; but I think the end is in sight . " ably customers used to enjoy telling me wonderful stories about the Bolton bird . who made so much money for his friends by telling them what , to buy and when , instead of croaking conservatively . Everywhere he went he was greeted with the respect that men accord the possessor of the Midas touch  --  the only touch that does n't harrow the feelings of the touched . " Came the crash ! Down went stocks ! Bolton 's customers ' millions melted magically . And what do you think happened to him ? He grew in the esteem of his victims by loudly admitting that . lie had made some mistakes ! Everybody always pays too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must admit we made money to beat . the band , but we all went too fast . The thing to do now is to find out . exactly how much our assets are really worth .

' He dispatched auditors and appraisers and experts all over the country to determine exactly the value of the concerns he had bought at . any old price . He asserted loudly there would be no self-deluding , no sugar-coating of pills , nothing but the truth . " In the Red for a Hundred Million " Well , prices of his stocks went below what his experts had figured as their true value . The customers waited anxiously for him to begin making up their losses and his partners begged him to begin buying , but he told them sternly : ' Not yet ! This is a bear market ! The pendulum has to swing as far toward the minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait until we get bargains that will knock your eye out. ! ' " Well , as all stocks went lower , everybody had to admit that Bolton 's mind worked even better on the bear than on the bull side . Finally , when stock prices were as far below true value as they had been above it the year before , Bolton bought heavily . His customers sat down to wait for the recovery . " Stocks continued to go down . Bolton congratulated his clients on their luck in having such a marvelous opportunity to make big money and bought more stock for them . Today his bargains are selling for about one-third of what he paid . Bolton has lost all his winnings . Today , when Bolton orates in that office , nobody listens . When he insists upon being heard , he talks to frowning faces . One of his victims figured the other day that the bunch was in the red rather more than $100 , - 000,000 . They are not my figures . " You know what Billy Brown did for Consolidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . His stock-market career was called the most remarkable episode of the greatest bull market in history . Billy used to go around the offices taking orders for goods from Wall Street men . In that way he made the acquaintance of many famous capitalists , among them two members of the group that controlled a great industry . Those men had money to burn . They liked Billy , who was as sharp as they come , witty and excellent company . He picked up some dope about the Acme Cooler Company , which was traded on the curb , and lie induced some of his old customers to form a pool . They all made considerable money out of it . Billy not only got his share but . they made him a present of a curb membership . He became a. specialist i.n Acme Cooler . He investigated the company 's business , got all the dope obtainable , found out that a still better apparatus was made by another concern , and in due time he effected a consolidation of all the cooler companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat on the Stock Exchange , where he became a specialist in Consolidated Cooler stock . His rich friends were represented on the directorate . " The Surest Money in Wall Street " He took to the stock-market game like a duck to water . He bulled Consolidated Cooler early and late . People used to laugh at him because he would never sell his own CC stock . He told his cronies on the door of the Exchange that the time would come when every home would have a cooler , which would make his company rank next to U. S. Steel and General Motors in size . Many believed him , bought CC and made fortunes . " The price of Consolidated Cooler rose and rose . Every day Billy 's newspaper friends told a quotation-reading world how much richer Consolidated Cooler stockholders were at the close . That way Billy got some wonderful publicity from the financial writers as well as from the greatest of all boosters , the tape . The stock was the sensation of the most sensational bull market in our history . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation . " Early in 1929 , Billy , who saw that some of his associates whose judgment he valued highly were reducing their holdings , did some unloading himself and became a multimillionaire in the process . Not only did he have the actual . cash in bank but owing to the prestige accruing to him as the engineer of the Consolidated Cooler rise , he had built up a wonderful business . He managed pools in other stocks and made commissions  --  which is the surest of all sure Wall Street money . Thousands of people were not only willing to follow Billy 's advice but begged for the privilege of being allowed to open accounts with his firm . It opened branches everywhere , and the money came in by wire . " The slump came and , of course , Consolidated Cooler , having had an extraordinary rise , had an equally extraordinary fall . Billy 's customers were massacred , marketwise . But Billy had his in his safe . The CC losses ran , accordin to the goss : of the Street. , into figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thousands of people lost millions in that wonderful stock , the newspapermen said at the time  --  and you know how conservative all newspapers are . As the bear market progressed , Consolidated Cooler politely led the way down until a price was reached that compelled Billy to buy . In the first place , he had to save his face and stop rumors of impending bankruptcy , when , as a matter of fact. , he was on Easy Street ; and , second , a man who has been for years a maker of millionaires and has been overpaid in adulation finds it pretty hard to remain a mere un thanked commission broker . He knew all about Consolidated Cooler  --  its huge business , its earnings and its prospects . Well , yesterday Billy Brown was reported to be broke . " But one of the greatest of the wizards was Walter Watts . He brought to the Street valuable assets , the chief being a large supply of theories and a , marvelous gift of financial oratory . Money-making had at last been reduced to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaive . A promise to make a man a millionaire is something that the deafest van hear . It 's like the doctor who describes so accurately and technically what . ails you that you ca n't help believing he is going to cure you . Walter told them why they were n't rich and then what to do to be cured . But you had to follow the indicated treatment . " dqn Easy Way to Make a Million " If there was anything he abhorred , it was a piker . He therefore interested not only hard-boiled , experienced investment bankers but three or four plungers who had made so much money that when they bought anything , the numbers they used , up to 100 , meant . millions , not . thousands . Walter became the stock-market manager of the group . Altogether , the paper profits of this coterie of hard-boiled Americans led by a financial genius were enormous . " In the office over . which Walter Watts presided during the bountiful boom years , you could find in the anterooms great capitalists waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the great man to deign to tell them what to do . Nobody in that bum+. sold , because that was contrary to Walter 's pet theory of speculation , which was ; Buy in bull markets . The one exception happened to be Walter 's private secretary , a remarkably bright girl , who sold every share she owned without telling her gifted boss about it . One of my clerks who has known her for many years tells me that she soaked away more than $1,000,000 . " Of course , after the bear market started , Walter Watts ' theories had to undergo a change . By that time everybody had lost everything . - Walter saw every cent he had made go the way of all Wall Street . wizardry . He did not have a follower in the world . But he has got himself a new set of theories that have to do with bear markets and how to make millions in brand-new ways . " I do not know how big Walter 's paper profits were at the peak , but they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men that Wall Street ever saw , because I can prove it . When he did not have a cent or a friend or a job or a home , what did he do ? He made a million without a penny to make it with . He did it in less than twenty-four hours . He married his secretary ! " rq $4,000,000 . Rdvance on $600 The head of a New York ban.k talked as if he had the courage that an easy conscience gives . One of the habits of his bank is to gain depositors when other banks have runs . His attitude toward the decline in security prices and his confidence in the future made me suspect that his bank probably confined its operations to banking . In the course of our conversation , he said : " It is not the psychology of the pub-lic that needs to he studied in order to know what to do , but . the psychology of the men to whom the public naturally looks for guidance . The lack of leadership in industry , finance and politics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years of depression there was still uncertainty at the end of 1931 . Any Wall Street broker will tell you that it is not the speculative public this time but the big interests who were responsible for the gloom . You saw rich men at the end of the year selling depreciated securities in order to establish income-tax losses , regardless of the fact that their sales established a lower level for prices . Think of what the virtual collapse of the bond market . did to the collateral held by banks throughout the United States ; and think of what it has done to borrowers who are sold out and thus deprived of the means wherewith to work to regain their vanished assets . When everybody loses nobody gains . I can understand the natural apprehension of a superannuated school-teacher about the solvency of her bank , but I can not understand what ails men who can buy securities and don't. because they fear a further decline . We saw , in December , bond issues break five points between sales . Reason ? Oh , yes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . Here is a bond that rallied five points on . the purchase of three bonds at 38 , 42 and 43 . That is to say , a man who invested $1200 in cash bought bonds that will pay him more than 12 per cent per annum , and in so doing caused a five-point . rally . The total issue is . $80,000,000 . That man could have come to us and borrowed $600 on those bonds , so , with only $600 in cash , could increase the market value of that . issue S4,000 , - 000 . " It only took the purchase of twelve bonds of another issue  --  an outlay of $5000 ? to mark it up $13,000,000 . The same thing happened on the way down . The sale of bonds having a cash value- of less than 51,000,000 affected the entire bond market in December to the extent of hundreds of millions . What did that do to collateral held by the banks on loans by business men ? What did it do to the state of mind of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quotation on a certain bond the other day because we had fifty of them on a loan which up to that time had been amply protected by the rest of the collateral . My brokers sent back word that it was 25 bid , offered at 80 . On that same day the sale of a single bond reduced the market value of an issue more than $8,000,000 . Soak the bondholder ! Punish the conservative investor ! With issues that pay from S per cent to 20 per cent going begging , the public must conclude that if the big men , who ought to know , pass them up , something awful is due to happen . " What the Country Needs Today " Well , take this railroad bond . It falls due on January 1 , 1933 ; one year from now . The company is solvent . It is a 3 to 1 bet that it will remain solvent .. And yet . that bond is selling on a 40 per cent basis . Is there anything any banker can do to make the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks and bonds which are bargains unless we all go to smash completely , in which case nothing is worth anything . The poor can not get poorer , but the rich can always find it easy , to stop being rich . Leadership , courage , facing the facts  --  that is what we need . how many taxpayers ' strikes will break out before the cities , counties , states and Washington decide that . it is time to begin to operate economically and efficiently , and that instead of finding ways of soaking the rich , they must devise measures to help the poor ?
