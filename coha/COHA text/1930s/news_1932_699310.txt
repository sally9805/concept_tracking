txt Gratitude From Middletown . To Me Editor of The New York Times : Realizing that for years I 've kidded and lambasted you city slickers , I 'm now graciously going to backwater and give you fellows great credit , as well as thanks , for certain educational advantages we poor devils hereabouts have had given us . ' Cause through your hard-earned tax money , indirectly extracted and so ungrudgingly given , you , - via. the Home Bureau Department of the State , are supplying just now a nice woman to learn our sparrin ' pardners how to make rugs , and another equally nice , one expounding illuminating lore an how to properly decorate the old farm shack at Christmas time , when the kids pay their annual visit , with a lantern for pop and a box of candy for mom . Consequently , as we are doubly grateful , this is said with two by becks . HOMER M. GREEN . Middletown , N. Y. , Nov. 30 , 1932.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
