The " Stop Hitler " movement initiated by Great Britain after the seizure of Czecho-Slovakia petered out ignominiously last week . Adolf Hitler was not likely to be stopped so far as Britain and France were concerned . British ( and , for that matter , French ) prestige fell to new lows on the Continent . <P> Britain had planned a pious milk- &-water; declaration against further aggression . But the nations on Adolf Hitler 's list of probable victims wanted a hard- &-fast; promise of military help . Moreover , The Netherlands and Switzerland , remembering that France had once sworn to defend Czecho-Slovakia and that both France and England had talked about guaranteeing dismembered Czecho-Slovakia 's frontiers , let it be known that they are not interested in French and British guarantees at all . Rumania 's pistol-point signature to an economic alliance with Germany showed what that country thought of the " Stop Hitler " campaign . <P> The signatures which the British Government was especially anxious to obtain for the " Stop Hitler " declaration were those of Poland , Russia and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of St. James 's , soon told British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that such a toothless declaration was meaningless , would only anger Herr Hitler . He suggested that Britain initiate conscription and sign a military alliance. * <P> Soviet Russia was flattered and amused that Britain was courting her . Soviet Ambassador Ivan Maisky even had lunch at the London house of Lady Astor , hostess of the famed appeasement-favoring Cliveden Set . But Russia let it be known that since Russia and Germany have no common borders , the Soviet signature was useless without Poland 's , and suggested an anti-Nazi conference . This was apparently too near to definite action for the ever-cautious British . The realistic French Quai d'Orsay looked upon the proposed British declaration as a typical instance of Anglo-Saxon diplomatic piety . French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet did , however , use the State visit last week of President and Mme Albert Lebrun ( " Mr. and Mrs. Brown " to Londoners ) as a fit occasion to talk matters over with British statesmen . M. le President and His Majesty King George VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Buckingham Palace . <P> Promptings . Despite the fact that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain has publicly buried his own appease-the-dictators policy , it was evident last week that such an old habit would die hard . Correspondents even suggested that the Cabinet 's Stop Hitler campaign was welded more by the white-heat of public indignation than by any new warmth for a showdown by the Government . Mr. Chamberlain admitted , however , that the present was no moment for him to go flying to see Fhrer Hitler again as he did last September .
