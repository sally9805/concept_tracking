The world 's greatest securities market is not , as most people suppose , the New York Stock Exchange . Together that exchange and 21 others in various U. S. cities trade in a mere 7,000 security issues . But the vast , inchoate and little publicized U. S. over-the-counter market deals with no less than 55,000 . The dollar volume of business it handles has been estimated as much as 300% above that of the exchanges , but no one knows how great it is . Nor does anyone know exactly how many " otc " dealers there are . On January 1 , 6,883 such dealers were registered with the Securities &; Exchange Commission , but it guesses that there are at least 3,000 more . <P> Since SEC 's major purpose is to police U. S. security markets , * this ignorance , after three years ' intensive study of the subject , might be surprising were it not that everyone admits that complete o-t-c regulation approaches the impossible . Congress was stumped by the problem while creating SEC in 1934 and purposely left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years ago , after a majority had done so , it began a cautious supervision ( TIME , Jan. 13 , 1936 ) . Last summer it issued a set of fair practice rules . But not until last week was it finally ready to take in hand the o-t-c market as firmly as it already has the exchanges . Through SEC Chairman William O. Douglas ' close friend and political backer , Senator Francis T. Maloney of Connecticut , the Commission presented Congress with a bill to regulate over-the-counter trading . <P> Since anyone who engages in the business of trading securities outside of an exchange is an over-the-counter dealer , o-t-c firms range in size from one man behind a dirty glass partition to frenzied establishments with 175 telephones . Because there can be no o-t-c ticker and hardly any published quotations , the market prices are established largely through dealer-to-dealer telephone inquiries . Dealers act either as brokers ( buying securities on commission for customers ) or traders ( selling securities they own to customers ) . <P> In counter trading there is no fixed brokerage commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic will bear . Most o-t-c dealers prefer to sell as traders because the " spread " between what they paid for a security and what they sell it for can be far greater than are most commissions . In both cases , however , customers have little means of telling whether they are quoted a fair price or charged a fair commission . <P> This indisputable evil is counterbalanced by numerous advantages which make the o-t-c market virtually indispensable . Since most exchanges will not accept new security issues without much red tape , counter trading is their primary market. * It is also the primary market for buying and selling huge blocks of securities . On the New York Stock Exchange , sale in one deal of $10,000,000 in bonds would cause tremendous speculative excitement and price fluctuation . On the o-t-c market , it passes unnoticed . Secretive firms , loath to disclose their finances , also prefer to have their securities traded on the over-the-counter market rather than on the exchanges . Banks and insurance companies are almost unanimously o-t-c patrons because they fear published fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
