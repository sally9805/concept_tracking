// Statement of the United States Treasury , and he took it . to a place where he could wrestle with it in solitude . His idea was to write a popular article on Government finance , popular in the sense that it should be so lucid that anybody could understand it . The subject was simple enough . The public purse . The people fill it in two ways  --  by paying taxes into the public Treasury and by lending their money to the Government on its promise to pay them back . Then the money is spent and the purse has to be filled again . Why should there he any difficulty about making the vicissitudes of the public purse quite clear on the plane of elementary arithmetic ? Yet , after a while , he gave up the idea . It was no good . What was happening to the public purse could be made intelligible only to expert accountants , and even so , much of it would be left in dispute . Why was that ? It , was because the Government itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , borrowing and lending in billions , operating in commodities and real estate , speculating in foreign exchange , manipulating money and credit to affect prices , pegging the price of its own bonds in Wall Street , besides banking in one and all of its branches  --  competitive banking , mortgage banking , investment banking , chattel banking , installment-credit banking , underwriting and promotion ; capital for all purposes ; interest rates low or nominal , adjusted to the needs of the borrower . Never was such a banking business as this . Millions of separate accounts . Books kept by automatic machines . Checks written in the same way . Everything guaranteed to be as good as money . The National Legerdemain Y ET , after all , astronomical magnitudes would not change the principles . Were not the principles that govern the universe the same as those that govern a toy ? As a business , this one , like any other , must have assets and liabilities , receipts and expenditures . The Old Reporter was looking at them ; and he saw that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business not subject to the laws of solvency that govern business . Why not ? Because , if the Government loses money in business , it can exert the taxing power to make the losses good . What could he say of a business that , first , in order to reassure its creditors , treats its outstanding loans as capital assets to be deducted from its own outstanding debt , and then , when these capital assets begin to come back , spends them as if they were income , but without showing them as income under the head of receipts , only as deductions from current expenditures , to make its expenditures look so much less ? No matter what he could think to say about it , who but an accountant would understand what he was saying and be able to follow it through ? And there it was that his idea began to fail . Moreover , about the public purse , it was n't true , as he had said to himself by way of simplification , that it was filled in only two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending their money to the Government on its bonds . Even that would not bold . The purse could be replenished again and again , as it had been once , by the ancient and reprehensible expedient of shaving the currency . When the Government repudiated the promise to pay in gold that was engraved upon its bonds , and then made people give up their gold , besides , under pain of fine and imprisonment , it shaved two fifths out of each gold dollar and called the shavings profit . That profit , or most of it , euphemistically explained as " increment resulting from reduction in the weight of the gold dollar , " now stands on the Treasury Statement under the head of " Exchange stabilization fund , S1,800,000,000 . " Nor is that all about this fund that came from shaving the gold . It is a fund that must be kept in a secret drawer . Thu Secretary of the Treasury , in his own discretion , may use it , spend it , or lose it , and the only person he is obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret-drawer fund of nearly two billions in the United States Treasury ! This was the point at which the Old Reporter gave up the idea of an artless treatment . of the public purse . He folded the Treasury Statement back into its original shape and sat looking at it thoughtfully . What did it represent ? A pyramid of billions revolving at high velocity on its apex . Could it go on revolving faster and faster forever ? Certainly not . On the other hand , it would be perilous to slow it down , if that were possible , and disastrous to stop it . Such is the law of whirling things . You might suppose the anxiety feeling was beginning to rise again in the Old Reporter . But it was not . Therefore , the thing he dreaded could not he economic disaster . What else did that piece of paper represent ? The answer he wanted would be a single word . When he had found it , the word was " power . " Arriving at it , was not difficult . What were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? First , physical power , whereby to compel obedience , which , in the case of a free people , is a visible and jealously guarded power ; secondly , economic power , which is neither visible nor jealously limited . The Food of Power Fi CONO.M1C power as the open road to kin- I limited government . This was tho thought that caused the feeling of anxiety to begin rising again . That pyramid of whirling billions was not cause , but consequence . What caused it was an incredible extension of the Government 's economic power , touching people in their common habits and in their work and in the conditions of their living , and touching them in the only way a government may act upon people at all , which is to say , by classes  --  creditors as a class , farmers as a class , wage earners as a class , the aged as a class , youth as a class , and at length imaginary classes , such as , on the one hand , economic royalists , and , on the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing except that in order to acquire unlimited economic power , by consent in the first place , the Government must undertake to redistribute the wealth of the country downward , taking it from those who have more and giving it to those who have less , whence , at last , those who have as a class and those who have not as a class . How little did people in general know about the nature of this power and what it must feed upon ! If they did not understand it , a power extending itself deeper and deeper into their lives , how could they be said to govern themselves intelligently ? And if it went on extending itself , what would be the effect at last upon Government , upon the relations of people to Government , upon human freedom ? The beneficiaries , of course , could not be expected to care . That was perhaps the worst part of all . This thought reminded the Old Reporter of how , when the Townsend Plan was a popular delusion , his elderly neighbors used to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took pains to tell them what the consequences would be , yet they invariably went away as little changed in their minds as if he had said nothing . He wondered at this , thinking he had not made it clear enough . Then he realised what the trouble was . They understood perfectly what he said to them . But they were not interested in the consequences . What if everything he said to them was true ? Well , it would not happen all at once , probably not until they were dead , and meanwhile they would have had their two hundred a month to spend . They did not wish his opinion on the plan , though that was what they asked for ; all they wanted to make sure of was that they were not being gypped out of their dues . The Haves and Have.Nots Putting the monthly Treasury Statement in his pocket , the Old Reporter went for a walk . He kept telling himself that property was not the subject . Property only came into it . He himself had no great tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would in a little while be used up or worn out or lost , having to he replaced continuously by new wealth . He supposed that if modern wealth were divisible and you put the whole of it in one pile and divided it equally among all the people , in a very short time the ownership of it would be again pretty much as it was before , unequal , of course  --  provided you left everyone free to do with his share as he pleased . Such being the nature of people , what would be the problem of a government that undertook to redistribute the wealth of a country among them according to an ideal plan , each to have enough for comfort , se-malty and happiness ? Not how to make the redistribution . That would not he difficult . The problem would be this ? that if people were left free in their folly and wisdom to administer their own affairs , then all the old inequalities of freedom would soon reappear and in a little while it . would he - as if nothing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , that is , to save people from themselves as people , it would lie necessary for the Government to limit their freedom and appoint itself guardian to administer their affairs . The lokic of this alternative bad already appeared . That was when the Congress was debating a bill to buy up a lot of arable land , divide it into small , made-ready farms , and give them to landless farmers on long-term mortgages at very low rates of interest . Observe , landless farmers as a subclass . The theory underlying this proposal was that a landless farmer was a victim of the social system , wherefore it became the duty of the Government to make amends to him . Nevertheless , common sense intervened to say that a landless farmer was very likely to be one who could not 1w entirely trusted , if only for the sake of his family , to do what he pleased with his own . He might put a second mortgage on the farm to buy an automobile , or he might sell his equity in it , lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , it had to be written in the bill that the farm he received from the Government , although it was truly his own , should be inalienable , which was to say he could not put a mortgage on it or sell it without the consent of the Government . Thus he was to become a landowner under the guardianship of the Government , not a freeholder . The only thing he should he free to do with his land would be to walk off and leave it . Nobody could think of a way to stop him from doing that , for if he were forbidden to do that , he would be a serf in fact , tied to the land . The Old Reporter made a pencil note on the margin of the Treasury Statement . It was to be added to it colleetion , in case he should be minded to write an essay ' on Government . The note was : " Political fictions . The fie-lion of political equality . A grand and supportable fiction . Freedom is thereby achieved . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom is thereby imperiled . Why ? Because eronomie equality is incompatible with freedom . It can be achieved only hy guardianship , compulsion and tyre tiny . " lie was standing in Constitution Avenue , a street . of complete magnificence , complete because it did nut happen first to be a street and then to be built upon ; it was created by design to be what it is . On one side , in styles of formal architecture , are the mighty seats of bureau and departmental administration ; and the weight of these is balanced on the other side by the stately premises of the public gardens , the National Museum , the Smithsonian Institution , and two beloved monumental pieces , the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument , besides the long , reflecting pool that was nude for the Washingtou Menu-malt to see itself in full length . The Beanstalk of Bureaucracy He could remember a time when there was no Constitution Avenue , but in place of it , even where he was standing , had been slums and sumps and the unmentionable life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thread of scarlet in the window . Here now , housed in marble arid granite , were bureaus of Government he had seen the beginning of in little brick buildings , in rented rooms , or with only a desk squeezed in somewhere , He was proud of it . Why should n't the richest country in the world have the finest capital city ? And this was , as he knew from having seen the others , the finest capital city . Not only that . It was the only great city in the world exclusively devoted to the uses of government . What , then , were his misgivings ? Not that his Government should he housing itself in a grand manner . That was all right . But that there should be so much more of it to house  --  that was the significant fact . Vi'hen those administrative bureaus and departments moved to Constitution Avenue , the buildings they vacated were not torn down ; they were filled tip immediately with new bureaus . And still there was not room enough . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , all these new bureaus , too , would he housed in marble and granite . He knew the natural history of bureaus , from having observed it for many years . When one was born into the rough political world , it seemed always so weak and defenseless that you would think any ogre of a senator or representative whose man had not been appointed there could eat it up at one bite ; and what saved it . at first was a behavior of prayerful. timidity . Thus , the instinct of self-preservation was already acting ; so was the principle of growth , It grew in a miraculous manner by cell division ; as it grew it acquired power and became ramified ; and when it was very large , it flit on a shell of marble or granite and became indestructible . Depression 's Building Boom There had been a boom in bureaucratic government . That was what Constitution Avenue signified , beyond its complete magnificence . In the environs of Washington it had been hardly possible to build small dwellings fast enough for the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people . How curious . This had been the only residential building boom in the whole country during and since the great depression . He happened to be looking at the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Once it was housed in the Treasury . Now it must have a grand building of its own , and yet more people in the Treasury Building than ever before . The space vacated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue Was needed fur new bureaus . Formerly the principal business of the Bureau of Internal Revenue was to collect liquor amid tobacco taxes . Now , besides a great variety or other taxes  --  punitive taxes , ouistowe taxes , regulatory taxes , social-security taxes , eorpuration taxes , and so on  --  it collects also the income tax , and for that purpose it must keep a separate tile for each citizen whose economic , status is above the line of the underprivileged ; it must know what he has in his safety-deposit box , how he keeps his books , how much money he makes , what he dues with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , if there is any suspicion , sends an agent to investigate his private papers . Then he looked at the Department of Labor , which , beginning as a statistical arid information bureau in a small , uneventful way , became a department of Government , now has its own imposing facade on Constitution Avenue , and represents the idea of regulating by Federal authority the hours and wages of labor through the wholecountry . The brick building vacated by the Department of Labor when it moved was occupied at once by the Social Security Board , or as much of it as could get in ; the rest or it went to Baltimore . The Social Severity Board was emitted to administer a law of compulsory thrift , if you live by wages , and whether you like it or not , the Government compel syourem pl over to deduct out of your pay envelope a. certain amount , beginning at I per 52 THE SATURDAY watt and rising to 3 , and send it to the Ceited States Treasury through the Bureau of Internal Revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly out of his own profits , adds an equal amount ; but this , too , in the end must . come out of wages , because the whole social-security tax is , in fact , a tax upon pay rolls . The Government says to you : This is your security . When you are old , the Go% ernment will give it hack to you with interest , and you can re . iire . " The ffovernment does not offer to save your money for you . It compels you . It becomes the job of the Social Security Board , therefore , to keep in touch with more than 30,1100,000 wage earners through the whole of their working lives , to know how much each one earns in order to know how much each one of them will be entitled to receive from the Government in old-age retirement . What a lot of marble it will take to form the shell of that L11- ' 1 ' 7111 !

As fast as the money comes in , the Government it rites its I 0 U for the amount , puts the 1 0 U in a special drawer , and spends the money . Farming by Edict " Constitution Avenue was imaginable , " said the Old Reporter . " I might have imagined it myself from the threshold of Dennis l'ilullum " s bar , at almost this very spot . But a national law of compulsory thrift , that was unimaginable from any point of view that was here twenty years ago . " These two changes , one visible in the form of a nyhilecture , the other invisible in the form of principle  --  Constitution Avenue and a law of compulsory thrift  --  they were somehow related . He was sure of it , if only he knew how to make them touch . Power in loth eases . A government putting forth its power . Who was Government ? Was there u natural history of governments , too , like the natural history of bureaus that ? knew ? 1reyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the lovely white building of the Department of agriculture . This had . been an exception . The Department of Apiculture was one that had not moved . Its new building was on the site of the funny old brick structure that housed it when there was about it a smell of seeds and harvest , and its work was to conduct biological research in the egetable and animal kingdoms , kill the boll weevil , and spread the evangel of better farming . That work was still going un , but what else ? The Department of Agriculture had become a gigantic economic machine , to plan agriculture for the whole country , to regulate it by administrative rules and edicts having the force of law , to disi ! ileac- , benefits and cash subsidies to farmers amounting in one year lo as much as the whole cost of Government was twenty-five years ago  --  and all of this under the theory that it was the Oovernment 's business to see that farmers as a class should receive a larger share of the total national income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer to do what he liked with his own land , under pain of a punitive tax , or , in the extreme ease , imprisonment , EVENING POST ' Flue machine , Its he knew , was not in the white building . Only the controls are there . Behind it is another building culled the United Slates Department of Agriculture Extensible Building . It has already five miles of corridor and yet it is designed to be extensible . Forethought of bureaucracy . The machine is there , and it is marvelous . Its organization is such that it can treat the entire country as one farm , saying how many acres there shall be in wheat : or earn or cotton , what kind of grass shall grow on the rest of the land , and whether the grass shall be plowed under for the good of the soil or fed to livestock , in case the price of meat is not already too low : or again , it is such that it would undertake on one week 's notice , maybe less , to nail a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " This farm is permitted to produce for sale only so much of this and so nitwit of that , by order of the Secretary of : 1erieuiture " ; and yet again , it is such that in one week from Tuesday , it can calculate what each farmer is entitled to receive from the Government in the way of subsidy for his willing obedience and mail out . 3,000,000 separate checks . All for the farmer 's own good , to be sure : all to save him from himself arid from the economic consequences of abusing his freedom . " I do n't know why I am doing this , " said the Old Reporter to himself . " I see no copy in it . But since I am looking at Government , I may as well go to a White House press conference . " And he went . The President sat at a large flat desk , under a strong light , smoking a cigarette in a holder , facing the newspapermen . He was sitting there when they came in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their first names , launched quips and sallies at them , and they answered back , though never with too much point , and never in a way to turn the laugh on the President . Every moment of it was his show ; he was pleased , amused and serious by turns , and so sure of himself that he seemed not to be giving his whole mind to it , as if at the same time he could be thinking of other things . The Press and the State It was all very agreeable . Was it too agreeable , perhaps ? The Old Reporter had learned to note laughter , because laughter is very often an unconscious statement beyond words . The laughter that weal . hack and forth here wits not on an equal plane , as everything else was made believe to he How should he think of it ? On one side it was laughing up ; on the other it was laughing down . Well , that might be so . Pass it . This happy access of the press to the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some would say it was democracy working in , perhaps , its best informal manner . But the Old Reporter fie longer knew what people meant by the word " democracy , " or the word " democratic . " Suppose it meant in this ease simply the informality of the President meeting the newspapermen in an intimate , easy manner . Well , he was not cynical , but he had known men who called themselves great democrats , and who were believed to he , because they spoke always in the name of the people , as if tittering by command the people 's innermost thoughts . He had never noticed that these men were marked by any particular kind of manner , either informal or austere . What did murk them in every ease was an imperious nature ; and , strange to say , they were invariably men who , in fact , distrusted the people and would be scandalized to hear you say so . Their faith in people was a faith in themselves . Proof of their distrust of people was their passion to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what was good for them , to reform them by law . The Old Reporter had heard that the President secretly entertained a great contempt for the press ; exempting , of course , the individual newspapermen for whom he conceived a personal liking . However that might be , it was obvious here that the press was not exploiting the President ; to the contrary , the President was exploiting the press . With one sentence  --  and it might be a sentence that was not to be quoted  --  he could make big headlines on the front page of every newspaper in the country , saying , the Government may , the Government will , the Government is about to , do a Pertain wonderful thing , and if these headlines turned out badly , he could make new ones at the next press conference . The One.Man Theme Just then the Old Reporter was thinking of a paragraph that had appeared in Arthur Krock 's New York Times column . The paragraph was : " In the present Government the President is supreme . He who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer rests with one man , the President , ' spoke the exact truth . " One man responsible for the industrial prospect of the country . How could that he ? Because , quoting Krock again : " Meeting on Monday with some of his close advisers , including Harry L. Hopkins , leader of the spending-to-save school , and Leon Henderson , economist , the President was quickly faced with two courses . One was to draw hack his budget-balancing pledge , open the floodgates of the Treasury again and begin pouring out the money in loans , grants , gifts and subsidies . The other was to turn every power of the Government toward activating private enterprise . " One man to decide these things ! One man to say what the economic future of the country shall he  --  whether the Government shall go the whole way or give private capital one more chance ! Arid that was the matt who sat there raving the newspapermen , chatting ' with Itm , exchanging pleasantries with them , laughing down to them , smoking a cigarette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Reporter wondered what would happen if a member of the press conference should say , " Mr. President , I read to you what Arthur Knack has written in The New York Times , " and should read it , and should then ask : " ls that true , Mr , President ? For if it is true , we have arrived at one-man government in the United States . " What would happen ? He knew very well what . The President would say : " Is Arthur here ? Ask him . " And one who ought to have known better than to make himself absurd for nothing would he laughed down at . by all . The fact was  --  and it might he a historical fact  --  that what Arthur Krock had written was not startling . It occurred in the middle of his weekly piece from Washington , with no special emphasis . Almost any Washington correspondent might have written it , or the equivalent of it . Indeed , it was hardly news . In contrast with what he had been looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote is time and meaning that he had almost forgotten it . He was then a Washington reporter and had the White House assignment . It was during the McKinley Administration . Nearly all the big news came from Cabinet meetings . The custom was for the reporters to be waiting at the White Housedoor when the Cabinet adjourned and the members began to come forth . Then what happened was that they took the members separately and walked oil with them , one reporter , maybe two or three , with each member , according to a plan , which , besides being a plan to divide the work for faster results , was one that . took account also of the personalities involved . Some reporters could get more than others out of the Secretary of State , others did better with the Secretary of the Navy , and so on . Later they came together again and made a fair exchange of their notes . And that was how a Cabinet meeting was covered . It was a very interesting time , too , because the Spanish-American War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out either with the members of his Cabinet or right after them , to go for his daily drive . The reporters bowed to the President and the President bowed to the reporters , but all that was ever said was " Good morning " or " Good of ternoon " or some very simple greeting . No one would have dreamed of asking the President what the news WAS . The Washington Star man  --  was his name Price ? ? was a large , fa t. person who suffered in the heat . He did best with the Secretary of  --  , One hot day be came back from his walk with him bringing a statement that he had written out in full as he received it , carefully , because it was important and might be controversial . It was to be printed , but with the stipulation that the Secretary himself was not to be quoted . Everybody printed it , and printed it in that way , and then it turned out to be wrong , and a piece of personal propaganda at that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the members coming out at once , the Washington Star man said , " Pardon me , gentlemen , but will you stop one moment ? We wish all of you to bear this . " Then he turned to the Secretary of ? and said : " Mr. Secretary , hereafter , if you can not tell us the truth , will you be so good as to tell us nothing ? Good day , sir . " The Secretary of ? got very red and said not a word . After that he was ostracized by the reporters . " Now , if we speak of what is democratic , " thought the Old Reporter , when he had finished this recollection , " is it hero or was it there ? I suppose , " he went on thinking , " there was not a man at that press conference today but has in his closet both a dinner jacket and a coat . with tails . They are a fine-looking lot . They are entertained socially all over the place by the people who give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unde'rstand , if they are not in official disfavor . And I suppose that in that gang of reporters of my time who ostracized a Cabinet member for hay , ing misled them by what they thought was an untruth in his own interest , there was not one dinner jacket , let be a tail coat , unless it was a Gridiron Club THE SATURDAY man who would have had to have one . I do n't remember him . " That night the Old Reporter was having dinner with an accidental group of gloomy men . One was in electric power , two were lawyers whose clients were coal and railroads , one was a public-relations man and one was somebody else . They talked about the Government , not government in theory or principle , but the Government , and what it was doing to business , and how it had ruined the railroads , and that now it was fixing a social price for coal while at the same time it was itself competing with coal in developing , with public funds , hydroelectric power to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to the private power companies . It went on for a long time , with frequent references to the Constitution ; and when one of them got too excited , the others looked around to see if he was being overheard , especially the electric-power man , for this was a public dining room , and an administrative officer of the Government might be sitting at the next table . The Barrier of Fear " Listen , you economic royalists , " said the Old Reporter . " I 've been listening to you for three hours . Do you realize that everything you have said in that time could have been expressed in one word ? " " What word is that ? " the public-relations man asked . " It 's a word , " said the Old Reporter , " that I 've been trying to think of for three or four days . A single word to define a new fact in the relations between people and Government . Tho word is ' fear . ' You are all afraid of the Government , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say we are afraid , " said the power man . " I 'm afraid to be seen talking to a representative of the Government . I 'm afraid that if I forget to report it to another representative of the Government  --  what one I do n't know  --  I 'll be breaking the law . You are right . Every man who has anything that can be taken away from him is afraid . Those who do n't fear the Government are those to whom the Government gives what it takes from the rest of us . " " That 's less than I mean , if you mean property , " said the Old Reporter . " I have n't any property to lose . What I fear is the loss of something much more important than property . " " I know what you mean , " said one of the lawyers . " But is n't it all one thing ? An attack upon property is an attack upon common honesty , and that is the same as to attack morals . " " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be classified as one who sets property rights above human rights . " " Pooh I " said the lawyer . " And you have been bringing in the Constitution , as if that had anything to do with it , " said the Old Reporter . " What do you mean ? ' as if that had anything to do with it ' ? " the lawyer asked . " This thing we speak of , calling it fear , is new , is n't it ? " the Old Reporter continued . " I 've been thinking about it a good deal in the last few days . I 've been trying to contrast the Washington I 'm looking at now with the Washington I first knew . I 've brought it down to the attitude of the ordinary citizen toward the Government . How has that changed ? When I first came to Washington , the attitude of every man EVENING POST here , of every man who came here on any errand , was that the Government was his Government . He supported it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ways in which the Government could touch him were definite and limited ; he knew what they were and submitted to them in a voluntary manner , and if it tried to touch him in any other way , he knew how to put it in its place . That was fine . At least , I think it was . But that feeling is entirely gone , Where will you find any trace of it left ? In place of it is fear . No man is sure what his immunities are . He may be suddenly confronted by a law he knows nothing about . He may be put in jail for violating the rules and regulations issued by a bureau . No man knows how , tomorrow , the Government may touch him or what he can do about it . Is n't that new ? Does n't it suggest to you a great change in the character of Government . Or do you agree ? " " Yes , we agree , " they said . " Well , " said the Old Reporter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights been rewritten ? " " Only violated , " said the lawyer . " You to say that , " answered the Old Reporter . " A man of the law . You should say reinterpreted . And observe , reinterpretations of the Constitution by the Supreme Court are constitutional . They become the law of the land . You are fooling yourselves who talk of defending the Constitution as if it were an immutable thing , like the Ark of the Covenant . This change we are looking at has taken place within the grammar of the Constitution . There is no power in phrases written on a piece of skin to stop government . Forget what is written in the document . Defend , instead , the spirit and philosophy that wrote it . " " Why do n't you writs that ? " asked the lawyer . And that ended the dinner party . Wisdom From Brazil In the papers the next morning , Brazil had the leading front-page position . A president named Vargas had anointed himself with the divine oil and by that act became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the municipal councils were abolished . An edict , called a new constitution , was proclaimed , giving all the power to one man . There was no trouble in the streets . People went to sleep one night in a republic  --  or was it a democracy ? ? and came awake next morning in the embrace of a dictator , with nothing more to worry about . Brazil was far away . The Old Reporter read the first few paragraphs of the news and was about to leave it , but his eyes went . on to something this Vargas was saying , and then he read it several times , Such a thing was not expected to come out of Brazil . There is a certain quality in the Latin tongues , especially the Spanish , a kind of ordinary excellence , that may account for the fact that they so often utter a complex thought with astonishing clarity . At any rate , this is what the Brazilian dictator was saying : " Today the influence and control of the state over economy tend to increase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the likelihood of civil strife gives way to the ever so much more serious likelihood of class struggle .

" What was it the Old Reporter had been regarding , here in Washington , though more the motions and surfaces of it than the inwardness ? Nothing else than what Vargas was talking about  --  namely , the extension of government in terms of economic power . All the governments in the world were doing it , for it was in the air of the times . In all the writings and sayings of government , and about governments , the noun " economics " and the adjective " economic " had taken the room of the noun " polities " and the adjective " political .

Here the Old Reporter recalled the opening of the fine introduction to Irving Babbitt 's book , entitled , Democracy and Leadership . He wrote : " According to Mr. Lloyd George . the future will be even more exclusively taken up than is the present with the economic problem , especially with the relations between capital and labor . In that case , one is tempted to reply , the future will be very superficial . When studied with any degree of thoroughness , the economic problem will be found to run into the political problem , the political problem in turn into the philosophical problem , and the philosophical problem itself to be almost indissolubly bound up at last . with the religious problem . " But there was a complete argument in what Vargas said , having the form of a syllogism . The increasing domination of economic forces by government leads to class struggle . Class struggle leads to civil chaos . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination of economic forces by government tends to produce dictatorship . Why does t he domination of economic forces by government lead to class struggle , if it does ? Well , in fact it does , and the reason why is simple enough . The end of economics is division . There is no point in producing anything unless it is to be either consumed or divided . In the modern scheme , few of us any more consume what we produce , not even the farmer , who produces a cash crop for sale and buys what he consumes . Therefore , all is division  --  nearly all . Thus , when the government begins to administer , or to dominate , the economic affair , it becomes involved at once in the endless quarrels over division , It must begin to say how the annual product of wealth shall be divided among the different classes of society  --  between capital and labor , between the agricultural and the industrial parts of the population , between the few and the many , the effectives and the inerfectives . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , only what government shall do  --  do for this class and that one , for the farmers , for the wage earners , for the underprivileged . What will the effect of this be upon a government that must appeal periodically to a popular vote ? Since nobody was content with the terms of division before , it follows that the government must change the terms . This it undertakes to do . It must have some rule for doing it . But there is no rule . So it invents one . The wealth shall be divided according to a rule of social justice . What is social justice ? Who can define it ? Shall it be decided by vote of the classes ? The Old Reporter turned the leaves of Irving Babbitt 's book again , and found this : " Social justice means in practice class justice , class justice meant ) class war , and class war , if we are to go by all experience , means hell . " He made a note of it in case he should want to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose we are convinced before we are born , " he thought , which reminded him to look in Emerson for a line about races springing from the ground already preoccupied with ideas for which they were willing to fight and die . Once in our history , many times in the world 's history , this had been an idea of freedom . Let . it be that freedom won . In a little while the price of freedom seemed too much to pay and them was a cry for government to limit freedom . Then the power of government began to rise again and freedom was on the defensive . " But that belongs to a thesis , " he said . " Writing a thesis is not reporting . A reporter 's first business is with the facts . " Dividing the notes he had been making into two piles , notes of fact in one pile and notes of judgment , opinion and feeling in another pile , and remarking the disparity between them , he wondered if the subject of government was a reporter 's job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
