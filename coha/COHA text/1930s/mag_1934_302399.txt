The sun poured down at Marathon . To the right of the winding road , on hills where goats nibbled the brown grass , the rocks made sharp black shadows . To the left , a warm , slow spray varied the edge of the Aegean . Pheidippides , running toward Athens 22 mi. away , headed down the dusty road . <P> When Pheidippides staggered up to the city gates , announced that the Persians had been defeated and fell dead of exhaustion , he was lucky . In a modern marathon race , he would have failed to reach the finish . The 193 runners who left Hopkinton , Mass , last week had 26 mi. , 385 yd. * between them and Exeter Street in Boston . A light wind fanned into their faces . Old Clarence De Mar , Keene ( N. H. ) school teacher , who has won the Boston Marathon seven times , waved to his friends at South Framingham . At Natick , a New York runner named William Steiner , who stepped along like a sprinter , was 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steiner slowed down and John Kelley of Arlington , Mass , and a pale , unhappy-looking Finn named Dave Komonen soon caught him . From the sidewalks , Wellesley girls waved to the runners who pass through their town in underclothes once every year-Leslie Pawson , last year 's winner ; cheerful Jimmy Henigan , winner in 1931 ; Paul De Bruyn , the furnace-man who trained for his victory two years ago by running up and down the back stairs of a Manhattan hotel . <P> Pawson got a cramp , walked for two miles , sighed and stopped . Henigan dropped out after 17 mi. and rode the rest of the route in an automobile . For 10 mi. , over the long Newton hills , Kelley and Komonen held their lead together , Kelley gaining a few steps as they plodded up , Komonen gaining a few as they coasted down the other side . At Boston College Komonen pulled ahead . He had trained for the race by running 15 mi. a day on snowshoes . At Coolidge Corner , coming into Boston , his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds roped off along the sidewalks . He was alone running down Commonwealth Avenue . He turned into Exeter Street as lightly as though he were trotting to catch a street car , whisked across the finish where he was timed at 2 hr. , 32 min. , 53 sec . He was sitting down to a plate of beef stew in the Boston A. A. clubhouse when the other runners arrived . <P> Like most marathoners , Dave Komonen is a small man , 5 ft. 6 in . He weighed 131 Ib. at the start of last week 's run , lost 6 Ib. along the way . Four years ago he came from Kakisalmi , Finland to Ontario , where he is a carpenter in the Frood Mine , at Sudbury . When he finished second last year in the Boston Marathon-hardest and oldest ( 37 years ) in the U. S.- Komonen was asked if he would try again . Aloof and taciturn , he answered " Rata auki ! " ( " Clear the track ! " ) . Last summer he won marathons at Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine at Sudbury , he received a marathon winner 's usual reward : a medal and a laurel wreath-presented to him by Boston 's Mayor Frederick W. Mansfield . <P> <P> * When the Olympic games were revived in 1896 , a marathon race was included in the program . Most famed of modern races was that from Windsor Castle to Shepherd 's Bush in the 1908 Olympics . The distance of the London run , some 4 mi. longer than the original , has been made standard .
