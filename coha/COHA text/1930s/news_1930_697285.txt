txt Demand for greater activity and effective aid on the part of the State authorities in areas where admittedly " grave deficiencies " exist in enforcement of the prohibition laws was made today by Attorney General Mitchell in making public the reorganization plan which will be . put into effect when the prohibition bureau is transferred to the Department of Justice from the Treasury Department on 1 July 1 . The reorganization plan provides for a reduction of enforcement districts from twenty-seven to twelve , to correspond with the Federal judicial circuits . Enforcement districts numbering eigkty-seven and corresponding with the Federal districts will remain about as at present . The bureau will be in charge of Colonel A. W. W. Woodcock , selected as director after a long period of ' successful work as Assistant Attorney General for Maryland and Fed-. eral Attorney at Baltimore , with Howard T. Jones as his assistant . Mr. Jones was assistant to Mabel Walker Willebrandt when she was Assistant Attorney General in charge of prohibition and is now assistant to Assistant Attorney General Youngquist , who succeeded Mrs. Willebrandt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo and now chief of special agents at Washington , has been selected to direct activities of District No. 2 , which ' will consist of New York State and Porto Rico , with headquarters at New York City . He will succeed Maurice Campbell . Mr. Campbell is ordered to Boston as permit supervisor under the Treasury Department . District No. 3 , including Pennsylvania , New Jersey and Delaware , with headquarters at Philadelphia , will be in charge of John D. Pennington , now administrator at Pittsburgh . S. 0 . Wynne , who has been administrator at Philadelphia , will remain there as permit supervisor . Attorney General Mitchell 's statement of policy , in which ' he said that his department would seek to bring about " that degree of law enforcement which can only come through the united efforts of State and Fed ' eral Governments , " backed up by the citizens , was : " While the object of transferring prohibition enforcement to the De ' partment of Justice is to secure close cooperation between the investigating and prosecuting officers of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage greater activity and effectiveness on the part of State and local ' govern/ mental agencies in enforcing the liquor laws , both Federal and State . " When the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted it was not contemplated that the Federal Government would I assume the entire burden of enforcement , or that the Federal Govern ' ment would create an enormous I police force duplicating that of the ' States , such as would be necessary to measurably enforce the law if I State authorities did nothing . DRY FORCES SHIFTEDthat degree of law observance and enforcement which can only come through the united efforts of the State and Federal Governments supported by the large body of citizens who , whatever their views toward the object of the Eighteenth Amendment , believe that the law of the land should be respected and obeyed . " The transfer , which is aimed at more effective enforcement of the dry laws , carries out a campaign pledge of President Hoover . After passage of the Williamson act , providing for it , the details were worked out by Mr. Mitchell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those for Districts 2 and 3 , are : No. ** England States , headquarters at Boston ; Jonathan S. Lewis , now in charge at Boston , administrator . No. ** Virginia , West Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , the District of Columbia ; headquarters at Richmond ; R. Q.

" Constitutional prohibition is ? the ! supreme law of the land . Its being in the Federal Constitution does not make it any the less the law of each State . True , there is no legal way of compelling State Legislatures to ! enact enforcement statutes or to compel State authorities to aid in enforcement , just as there would be I no legal way of compelling Congress I to enact enforcement legislation if it chose not to . The moral obligation Ito take measures to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment rests alike I on the Federal and State Govern ; ments . The power is concurrent and , therefore , the duty is concurrent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments and the Federal Government would each take a part in the enforcement . In those States which have repealed enforcement statutes and whose authorities do not perform a proper share of the work , there have been , and will continue to be , grave deficiencies in enforcement . Where such conditions exist , they are a matter of choice with the States . " Some States enforce their liquor laws so effectively as to leave little to be done by the Federal Government . There is cooperation between Federal and State authorities over much of the country , and some officers , even in those States which have repealed their enforcement statutes , give assistance to the Federal authorities . " The department will put forth a special effort to confer with authorities of each State , or at least those who have enforcement statutes of their own , relative to the part the States may play in the performance of this difficult teak and to secure Assignments of Funds and Agents . While all assignments of administrators and deputy administrators are temporary , most of them will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to occur within the next two or three months , according to Mr. Mitchell . Of the current appropriation of $13,500,000 available for the Bureau of Prohibition in the Treasury De-1 partment , abount $9,000,000 has been 1 allocated to enforcement and $4,500 , - 000 to supervision of permits . Property and equipment have been divided on substantially the same basis . Of the personnel , about 2,700 , including 1,750 prohibition agents , investigators and special agents , will be transferred to the Department of Justice and about 1,700 will remain in the Treasury Department . A corps of men from the two departments will superintend the actual transfer of personnel , equipment and records at the various headquarters in order that the new organizations may be set up and ready for action immediately after July 1 . About 250 special agents will continue to investigate the more extensive liquor law violations , such as importations , large-scale manufactures and conspiracies . The preliminary work of revising the joint regulations relating to the manufacture and use of Industrial alcohol and Intoxicating liquor has been completed . Further study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those now in force will be continued until Sept. 1 . The Department of Justice will be represented by the prohibition administrator and the Treasury by the permit supervisor at the headquarters of each district , in order that there may be close cooperation between the two departments . " The prohibition administrator will exercise general supervision over enforcement activities in his district , " Mr. Mitchell said . " The direct responsibility for the actual work of enforcement will rest primarily on ' the deputy administrators , of whom there will be , as now , one in each of the eighty-seven judicial districts of the United States , other than Alaska , where the United States marshals perform that duty . " The offices of deputy administrator and United States Attorney in each judicial district will be closely coordinated to obtain a maximum of efficiency In enforcement work . " The Treasury will have a Bureau of Industrial Alcohol , in charge of the present Prohibition Commissioner , Dr. James M. Doran , which will retain the duty of issuing permits for the manufacture and use of alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities of the permittees .
