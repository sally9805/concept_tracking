As well as being one of the noisiest and most crowded in the world , the New York subway system is also the safest . Over its 230 miles of track bed , 8,755 electric trains clatter daily on split-minute headway , carrying well over 1,500,000,000 passengers every year , more than three times as many as ride each year on all the big U. S. railroads put together . Until this week no subway passenger had lost his life in a train crash in more than two years . Then one morning a closing car door caught a woman 's hand as a local train started to move out of an east-side station . An excited passenger jerked an emergency stop lever . The train jammed to a halt . Into the rear of it banged another local that was coasting into the station . Toll : two deaths , injuries to 50.
