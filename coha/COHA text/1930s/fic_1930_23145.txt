AFTER ALL A STORY BY ROLAND ENGLISH HARTLEY W HEN Paul Berryman and Edna urged him to go walking with them on the hills back of the campus that Sunday morning in the early spring , Allan knew at once that the thing he had been expecting had come ; for always before this his sister and his roommate had seemed to find their walks enjoyable enough without him . There had been a dance at the house the night before , and when Edna came down from the city in the afternoon Allan had met her at the station to escort her to the sorority house where she had friends to offer hospitality . " How 's mother ? " he had asked as they went along the curving walk beneath the elms . " Oh . . . all right , I guess . " " Does n't she mind being left alone when you come down here so often ? " " She wants me to come ! " " Yes , she 's that way . " There was something in his tone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect me to sit around home and enjoy being gloomy all the time ? " He made no answer to this and presently he asked , " Have you seen dad lately ? " " No . But I had a nice letter from him a few days ago . " She seemed to be on the point of saying more ; but they had turned in beside the wide lawn by now , and two of the girls were moving toward them from the porch with trills of welcome . Allan set down his sister 's bag and got awayhastily while kisses were still being distributed . That night after the dance Berryman sat for longer than usual on his narrow couch across the room , his knees drawn up to his chin , his round face beaming fatuously above them , lighting one cigarette after another and discoursing upon Edna 's charms . Finally Allan broke into his rhapsodies . " For the love of Pete , Berry , let a fellow get a little sleep . I 've known Edna ten times as Icing as you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Berry grunted " Oh , all right " resentfully and reached for the light button . Then in the morning they wanted him to go walking with them . They struck off into the hills , above the lake , along a road that wound across grassy slopes among scattered oak trees . Edna and Berry were merry and nervous and absorbed in each other . Allan at last demanded of them impatiently , " Have you got something to say to me or did you just bring me along to enjoy your lamb-like caperings ? " Then they told him that they were engaged . Of course he had known it was this . " Well , it 's up to you , " he said . Berry laughed rather self-consciously . " Thanks for the congratulations ! " Edna ran her hand under Allan 's arm . " Ca n't you be nice , for once ? " He did n't want to say these harsh things , but there was that tautness within him that would let no other words come . He achieved an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrents . Later , in high-school days , he came more and more to think of himself as " on his father 's side . " He resented his mother 's watchfulness over his own comings and goings and was warmed by his father 's objection to this as " nag-ging . " " What do you always keep after the boy for ? " his father often said . " Are you trying to make a mollycoddle out of him ? " His mother made no answer to these complaints and only set her lips more firmly . Her eyes were troubled . The boy felt sorry for her at the same moment that he felt triumphant for himself . For a few days he could n't enjoy his father 's sly jokes about the " lord high executioner . " Life was growing difficult and confused . The sense of confusion grew in him as the years went by . For he was seeing now what had been hidden before and he knew that his father 's gait was sometimes uncertain and his speech unsteady , and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was torn back and forth in his loyalty between the two . The only defense was a pose of defiance , towards them , and everyone else , and the feelings that made constant battle in him . He was glad when it was time to go away to college . Down here on the campus one seemed to be breathing a fresher air . One talked and exchanged experiences and acquired new judgments and grew away from the sentimentalities of home . One learned new ways of facing life . And out of all this grew a tolerance toward his father , a renewed sense of companionship . This sense was strengthened by his father 's occasional Sunday visits to the house . The fellows liked him . They did n't feel constrained and unnatural in his presence as they did with most of the fathers . They swapped tales with him and liked his hearty laughter and liked it when he clapped them companionably on the back . Allan had never before known his father in these moods . At home he was always quiet , making his rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down here with the fellows he was a different man . Allan felt proud of him . It was his father who told him , one Sunday afternoon when they walked on the Quad , that he was " on his own " now , that he bad left home and had an apartment downtown . Allan had n't known anything about it ; they had n't written of this . " You ca n't imagine how much better I feel , " his father said eagerly , with a hand under his arm . " And I 'm sure your mother feels the same way about it . She 's a splendid woman , Allan , but we never quite hitched . You know how particular she is about every little thing . I could n't get used to that . I felt sort of cramped all the time . But now .. . I 'm a new man ! " Allan had been at college for three years . He had spent his vacations working all about the state  --  in summer camps in the mountains , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hollywood . He felt that he now knew something of life . He could meet his father as a man of the world . " I 'm sure it 's the best arrangement , " he said gravely . His father 's fingers tightened about his arm . " Drop in and see me whenever you come up , Allan . We do n't want to lose each other . " They shook hands warmly over the promise of continued companionship ; yet when Edna came the next week the first thing that Allan asked was , " How 's mother ? " Edna 's frank brown eyes met his own squarely . " Do you know about it ? " " Yes . Dad was down here last Sunday and he told me . " " It 's ever so much better that it came at last . " " But how 's mother ? " he demanded again . he went up to the city he liked to be with his father in his little sitting room , their legs swung over the arms of leather chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as man to man . It was pleasant to have gone beyond the awe and fear one felt of a parent . It was pleasant to regard one 's father with understanding and a tolerant liking . Perhaps , Allan thought , his father had found the answer to all the unanswerable things  --  found it in ceasing to look for it and in easy yielding to the impulses of the hour . It was on a day not many weeks before Edna and Berry took him for that morning walk in the hills that Allan had last seen his father in the city . When he rang at the apartment door a booming " Come in ! " had sounded . He turned the knob and called out " Hello ! " His father , looking flustered and sheepish , came charging to meet him in the doorway . " Oh , " he was mumbling , " I thought it was the boy with the magazines . " He stood there as if to bar the way . Beyond his shoulder Allan saw a woman in the large chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcoming smile . " is this Allan ? " Her voice had a high , metallic quality . His father stood aside , doing his best with a smile . " Yes , this is Allan . . You 'd better . . . wo n't you come in ? This is . - I 'd like you to meet Miss Jewett . " Miss Jewett laid her cigarette in the tray beside her and lifted a heavily ringed hand to Allan . Closer to her now , he saw the harshness of her skin beneath the overdone make-up . " Well , I 'm glad to get a look at you at last , " she was saying . He found nothing to answer . There was that tautness in him that held back words . " I 've been hearing a lot about you , " she went on easily . " Your father 's certainly proud of you . " He caught a laugh in his throat . " But he 's certainly done his darnedest to keep me from seeing you . I don'tknow whether he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She laughed noisily . " You college boys have the reputation of being regular devils , you know . " There was a moment 's silence , and then Allan 's father , who still stood near the door , said laboriously , " Miss Jewett used to work in the office . " " Oh , only for a little while , " she explained airily . " It got very tiresome . " Again she laughed . " It 's about all I can do nowadays to keep an eye on this old gentleman . I guess , " she added confidentially to Allan , " you know all about him . " " Yes , " Allan answered flatly , " I guess I know . " She motioned to the chair beside her . " Sit down here now and tell me about college . You know , I used to think I 'd go to college some day myself if I ever had time . But somehow I never got around to it . But I always did like college boys . " The bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the door . " I got ' em all , Mr. Slater . " The lanky , sallow bellboy came in with a handful of gaudy magazines and dropped them in the chair beside the woman . " Here you are , Mrs. Slater ! " She laughed and said , " Thanks , Tom . " Allan went over to stand by the window , fingering the curtain and looking down into the noisy street . When the boy was gone his father , after a few moments of silence , cleared his throat heavily . " Wo n't you sit down and stay a little while , Allan ? " His voice had a quavering note of entreaty . Allan turned sharply away from the window . " No , I was just on my way out to see mother . " He halted on his way to the door to bow stiffly over Miss Jewett , who was already fingering the crisp pages . She gave him her limp hand . " Oh , I 'm sure we 'll meet again soon , now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the " I have n't thought very much about that yet . " " You could sell this big place , I should think , and be more comfortable in a few rooms somewhere . " Presently , while he paced again , she asked him , " What are you going to do , Allan ? " And he too echoed the words , " What am I going to do ? " " You 'll be through down there in a few months , " she reminded him . " Yes , in June . " " Have you any plans ? " He had a number of possible plans but they were all thrown into disorder by his unrest . " I 'm not sure just yet , " was all he could say . " I do n't want to give up the house , " she said , " in case you want to come home . " " I do n't know what I 'll do , " he mumbled . He looked at his watch . If he hurried he could get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away . He felt that he was being subtly bereft of his freedom . In the lower hail his mother clung a moment to his coat-sleeves . " You 've always been such a comfort , Allan . " He thought of his harsh words upstairs . " Pretty poor comfort , " he muttered . " But you have , dear . . . . And now you must be kind to Edna . " Edna again ! He snatched up his hat . " I 've got to be running along . " He felt freer when lie got outside . He was away from it all for a while ! And the very next morning , within ten minutes after they got up from the breakfast table , Berry asked him to be his best man . " Hell , no ! " Allan shouted at him . Berry 's face grew very red . " Oh , all right . then . " All morning Allan thought about it . He might as well have stayed away from those lectures . At noon , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theshaded walk ahead of him . He hurried to overtake him and caught him by the elbow . " I 'm sorry , Berry , old man . Of course I'Il stand up with you . " Berry was n't the fellow to harbor resentments . His cheerful smile came readily . As they went up the steps of the house he was telling Allan all about the bungalow he was having built in his little Oregon town . And Allan was elapping him heartily on the back . He felt happier than he had for many months . Perhaps this was the way : going to meet things  --  his mother 's way . Only he would try to steer clear of the grimness . He would grin hack at the grinning stupidities of life . It was in this spirit that he made his visits home during the next weeks . He never stayed there long . The house was in a turmoil . Little Miss Murchey , the bent-backed dressmaker , was living there now ; and a fellow could scarcely find a chair to sit on without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls were always gliding in and out , going up and down the stairs with excited whispering , intent upon some treasure known as " the things . " Helen Parkinson , a robust blonde , who was to be Edna 's maid of honor , was almost always there . Her manner toward Allan showed her acquaintance with the tradition that a romantic attachment is bound to spring up between the two seconds . Allan retaliated with all the cynicism acquired in four years of college life . He explained to her fully about the crumbling social order . Sometimes they talked in the sewing room , where Miss Murchey listened with snapping eyes . " Do n't you fret , " she said one day , " there 'll always be weddings as long as there 's wedding dresses . " Back at the house on the campus , he had to listen to Berry 's long accounts of that bungalow . Sometimes he began the talk himself . " Let 's see now , Berry , how many nails did you say there were in the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explain the con-kneeling now ; and then once again the organ was sounding as they turned to march to the door . With the maid of honor 's hand on his arm and her warm smile enveloping him , Allan turned to look into the front pew . His mother 's one hand clung frightenedly to the back of the seat while the other reached slowly out for the arm of his father , who stood large and smiling beside her . Home , with its ranks of white tables spreading through all the downstairs rooms , seemed strange and unfriendly . Edna and Berry , in a corner of the sitting room , were doing their best to say very old things in very new ways . His father was moving about from group to group with his ready laugh . His mother was nodding brightly to the eager comment of their Aunt Bertha , a faded lady in stiff satins , who had come from Sacramento . Allan went to his mother for a moment to press her hand before he joined the swirl about the bride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place at the bridal table he could look across to the table where his mother and father sat with Berryman 's uncle and aunt , a tall , thin man and a tall , thin woman , who had come all the way from Oregon . Mr. Berryman was beaming across at the young couple ; and Allan 's father , whenever there came a moment 's pause in the hilarity , called out loudly , " Well , well , what 's the matter over there ? Bride and groom quarreling already ? " Allan was careful not to meet his mother 's eye . Then Mr. Berryman arose to express his fervent hope that the young couple , untouched by the restlessness of their times , might know the lifelong , unbroken happiness of their elders . There was a slackening of the quick tension when Mr. Slater 's voice came booming out , " Hear , hear ! " Relieved approval sounded from all the tables . Allan saw his mother 's hand trembling against her glass ; but she raised her eyes , wet and shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . . . Allan was surenow of what he wanted to do . He wanted to stay here with her . . . . At last it was over ; Edna and Berry had gone upstairs to change ; the others were marking time with vague talk until their reappearance . Allan sat by himself in a dim corner near the stairway . It was as good a place as any to evade the ardent bridesmaid . He watched the Filipino boy clearing the little tables away . The doorbell rang , and the boy set down his napkin and went to answer it . As he stepped back from the door a woman came in . There was a group of young people near the door , and she was at once among them . But Allan had seen her face . It was that woman , that Miss Jewett . As he jumped from his corner and hurried toward her , her shrill voice sounded loudly . " Well , this is a nice family party , is n't it ? That 's what they told me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and see for myself . " Her glance was moving searchingly through the rooms . Allan , turning his eyes to follow it , saw his father fortunately hidden in a tight little group and then saw his mother moving forward , with an anxious look of surprise . He stepped quickly between her and the woman at the door , catching for an instant his mother 's doubtful glance at him as she halted there . The young people by the door had drawn away from Miss Jewett , and she stood there alone . Allan saw that her lips were slack and her eyes unsteady . " She would n't have done it , " he thought , " if she had n't been drinking . " He came to stand close before her , shutting off from her view as much as he could of the MOMS . " Well , if here is n't that nice college boy ! " " Yes , here I am , " he said hi a low voice . " Shall we get out of this ? " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to stay and see the fun . " He took her by the arm . " No ; come you do n't mind I think I 'd like to get out and walk . " " Suit yourself . " His father drew up to the curb . " I 'm damn ' glad that affair is over , " he said as Allan climbed out . " Yes . I feel that way about it too . Good-night . " His father was whistling as he drove away . Allan turned back toward home . He was still thinking that he had heard his mother call . Anyway , he wanted to walk . A fog had blown in from the sea and he liked the cool soothing of it against his face . The house was quite dark when he came to it . He stood on the sidewalkfor a long time , looking up to the windows . Fog blew across his face and gathered in drops on his lashes . At last he turned away , and knew now , when he still seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those voices that would always be sounding in the silence . He walked on . The day that he had looked to to ease him of burdens of doubt had come and gone , bringing him only greater unrest . He walked for hours before turning back to the hotel . He wanted to be very weary , and then to sleep . Perhaps , after all , there was only this answer to all deep questioning : weariness that brought a respite from thought .
