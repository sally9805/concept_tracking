Sophisticated New Yorkers , accustomed to the finesse of their annual Skating Club Carnivals , have been slow to warm up to professional , itinerant ice shows . Last week , however , when the Ice Follies of 1940 hit town , New Yorkers crammed Madison Square Garden to the rafters for six nights , whistled and stomped like yokels . For suddenly , it seemed , the variety-show-on-ice had crystallized into first-rate entertainment . <P> It was the fourth year the Ice Follies had come to Broadway . The show was started on a shoestring by Eddie Shipstad &; Oscar Johnson ( a pair of St. Paul skaters who first got into the business 13 years ago when they were hired to do a comic Bowery skit at a Manhattan hockey game ) and Eddie 's younger brother , Roy . In 1937 , the Follies were as crude as a road company of East Lynne . Next year the little St. Paul troupe was more professional . Last year they were still better . This year their show was as polished as any Follies the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staged , its acts varied from acrobatics to ballet , from comic capers to spinning solos . It had no glittering star like Hollywood 's Sonja Henie . But skating fans last week were ready to adopt new ice gods : Wisconsin 's piquant Bess Ehrhardt and dashing Roy Shipstad ( the " human top " ) ; Adagio Specialists Idi Papez and Karl Zwack of Vienna ( onetime European pair champions ) ; Brooklyn-born Evelyn Chandler , who turns nine Arabian cartwheels without touching hands to ice ; little Harris Legg , who takes a breath-taking leap over a lineup of eleven barrels and as a giant snowman performs the rare stunt of skating on 18-inch stilts ; onetime Minnesota Footballer Heinie Brock and his buffoonery ; Eddie Shipstad &; Oscar Johnson , still cutting up in their own show . <P> But the skaters that brought down the house each night were Frick &; Frack , a pair of Swiss comics . Frick &; Frack have been a scream ever since they first skated together in their native Basle three years ago . Frick , whose real name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zurich . Frack , born Hansruedi Mauch , was studying at a business school . One holiday afternoon they set to burlesquing some of their pompous neighbors who acted as though they owned the rink . Onlookers tittered merrily . <P> Before they realized what was happening , Frick and Frack were performing in Zurich , Berne , St. Moritz . At St. Moritz an English producer spied them , hired them to do a turn in a London ice show . In London last winter a U. S. promoter saw them , hired them to do their stuff at Hollywood 's Tropical Ice Garden . When the Tropical Ice Garden melted after four weeks , Frick &; Frack got one job and another , finally found themselves in St. Paul 's Skating Carnival . There Producers Shipstad &; Johnson , who know a good comic when they see one , grabbed the boys from Basle-at $500 a week for 48 weeks of the year .
