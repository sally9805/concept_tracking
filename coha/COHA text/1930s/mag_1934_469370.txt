EXACTLY a year ago I stood listening to the congratulations of a stream of people at my wedding reception . One of them told me that a certain white-haired old gentleman had compared me to the " innocent brides " of his own day . A moment later an intellectual looking gentleman with glasses wished me tuck , and in an undertone expressed his surprise that a person like myself should have wanted all that " archaic mummery " ? with a gesture toward the church and a deprecating glance at the minister . How wrong they both were I could not know then . Despite every effort I had made I was quite unprepared for the most remarkable discovery of early marriage . So I nodded agreement to the gentleman with glasses and tried not to smile too much when I shook hands with the gentleman with white hair . The innocent bride has been extinct for a number of years . She vanished , not merely because the modern girl in her last year in school or her first in college takes a course in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels and sees uncensored plays , not even because she may have had pre-marital experience , but because she makes a deliberate effort just before her marriage to acquire what might almost be called a technical knowledge of the subject . Innocence , in most cases , has fled long before she becomes a bride . Ignorance remains to be dealt with . Most young couples to-day are familiar with the dictum of Havelock Ellis that the average man making love to the average woman resembles an ourang-outang trying to play on a violin . They are familiar with the fact that many brides are hysterical or frigid , and they appreciate that a little judicious reading can do much to instruct the ourang-outang and to put the violin in tune . Nevertheless , the spectacle of my fianc ? and myself seated in the sunshine of an August garden discussing the endocrine glands was something which , to my mother 's mind , consorted ill with both delicacy and romance . It was what our white-haired old gentleman most certainly would have called " taking the bloom off the peach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these books to read she said to me with a reminiscent look , " Perhaps that was why I felt thus and so . " Thirty years of married life had failed to give her an explanation which she had sought in secret . Again , a recently married couple , both of whom had had pre-marital experience , fell to reading a hook on the physical side of marriage merely as a favor to one of their well-meaning but more " innocent " friends . They were both amazed at the number of things experience had not taught them . Now they go about presenting this book to all the engaged couples they know . This state of things is comparatively recent . The first few of my acquaintances who married did not think of preparing themselves in this way . Of the dozen or so who have married in the last two or three years all but two have done so , one of these being exceptionally old-fashioned , the other exceptionally neurotic . Nevertheless , I was somewhat surprised about a week before our wedding when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youngish man , married only a few years himself , and he had a goodly number of scientific books to suggest if we had not already read them ! The explanations are not far to seek . Psychoanalysis has traced countless unhappy marriages to sexual maladjustments , and its findings are becoming more widely known each day . The attempt to make marriage a success through knowledge and prevention is exactly comparable to the enlightened if self-conscious attitude of recent parents toward their children . The latter naturally came first because modern psychology lays its first emphasis upon childhood . Now we are going back still farther , to the foundations of the family into which the child is to be born . But there is also another reason . I believe that the spectacle of divorce has appalled the young people of or approaching marriageable age even more than the elder generation . When I was a sub-deb I went to dancing classes and parties attended by pupils from most of the well-known schools in New York . Of the " older girls " and many also of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two of them have been divorced several times . And they were not , be it said , mere nodding acquaintances but people whom I knew tolerably well . If these repented only in the divorce court , why should I be in haste to marry ? Too much pleasure , work , and freedom are available to the single young woman of to-day . Why should I give them up for an institution which has been a conspicuous failure among so many of my friends ? A girl who reasons thus will be keenly aware of her position when the inclination to marry does come . She will go into it with her eyes open . She will be doubly eager to make it a success . To be sure , there was a time when young people married with the avowed intention of going promptly to Reno " if it did n't work . " But the Gin Period is out of date . Modern young people have no intention of leaving matrimony to work itself out . Rather are they inclined to listen humbly to what Grandmamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time that they keep Keyserling or Doctor Stopes under their arm . II With such preparation then we were married . After a few months the discoveries about the physical side of marriage were condensed into something quite simple . The books , we found , were right . Our friends and popular opinion were wrong . I refer chiefly to that amazing but still prevalent delusion that the engagement marks a happiness which rises to its climax in the honeymoon and then gradually sinks back through a period of adjustment to a level that is generally pretty humdrum . Love and passion are very different , our parents told us . Love lasts , passion does not . Love is all right . passion ? well , we were given the impression that they did n't know much about it , they were glad to say , but referred us to the young man who .. was lost totally And married a girl in the corps de ballet . Was this merely prudish , old-fashioned ? A callow sophisticate once observed to me that " you could be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I have not been married long enough to know whether or not it is true that companionship , security , and several other things our parents told us about increase with time . What I do know is that it is in the nature of passion to do so . Tolstoi is the only novelist I have ever read who has dared to call the honeymoon a " greatly overrated period " and to depict the greatest physical happiness later on in the married life . And it is one of the chief functions of the textbooks on marriage to indicate how much passion can grow , not only for the woman but also for the man , and that it can last many years provided certain conditions are observed . These books emphasize various matters of technic , the importance , directly and indirectly , of giving satisfaction to the woman as well as to the man , and the importance of divesting oneself of the idea that the body is evil or shameful . Did people 's religious taboos make it necessary for them to conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of love ? Or were these taboos and the many painful complexes related to them so strong , or men 's methods so blundering , that such consummation rarely occurred ? Or again , did our elders say nothing merely in order to preserve the honeymoon myth ? I do not mean that my honeymoon was not marvelously happy . Certainly there was a freshness and wonder about it which I do not expect to experience again . But it was largely a mental and emotional happiness , not unattended by a certain strangeness and uncertainty . It is easy to understand the delight of an embrace . The delight of a complete union is both more difficult of achievement and more substantially enduring . But possibly the chief reason for silence on this point is simply the fact that most of the people who profferadvice on marital questions are comparatively old . Perhaps they have forgotten what the first years , the first months , were like . I trust that I shall neither forget nor fear to be frank , for I believe that it is unnecessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love that that part of it which is most present to him at the moment will be the first to die . I should urge rather that he study to develop and preserve it , realizing that he can avoid many of the things which tend to put it to flight . People who fear lest such counsel place an overemphasis upon the element of passion , thus making it the easier to confuse with love , should appreciate that they are unconsciously doing the same thing when they keep reminding us of its evanescence . This question of religious taboos has received much publicity of late . It has been held responsible for all sorts of repressions , maladjustments , illnesses , and sometimes , through a process of reaction , violent excesses . In the concept of the virgin birth there is , of course , an implied condemnation of intercourse on this earth , and about the best St. Paul could say was that it is better to marry than to burn . Incidentally , there were plenty of saints who preferred to burn , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early Christian asceticism was the inevitable corrective to Roman decadence and the overemphasis on things carnal which that involved . But like many another mode of thought , it has outlived its purpose and now causes more trouble than it is worth . I believe that the modern scientific attitude toward sex , even though still in the making , is far more wholesome and useful for modern people . Voluntary parenthood is a part of that attitude . And though I was keenly disappointed when considerations of health obliged me to postpone having a baby for a time , 1 came to believe that a slight delay would be beneficial to both husband and wife in almost any marriage . Another of the surprises which was in store for us concerns the clement of fun ? fun as children and , possibly , animals know it , a na ? ve , exhilarating , end-in-itself experience which is seldom accessible to adults , but which , if it exists for them at any time , exists in the first year of marriage . I can not understand why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people suggest that early marriage is a delirium of happiness never to be repeated ; so-called realistic literature and sober-minded people , that it is a period of very delicate adjustment usually entailing much disillusion . It occurs to me that possibly the very intensity of the former and the seriousness of the latter require to be offset in our constitutions by a certain species of comic relief . At any rate , it is always fun to live with another young person whom you like , particularly if you have been living alone or with much older people : how much more so if one of you is a man and the other a girl ! Possibly the physical inhibitions just referred to also stifled a good deal of this natural exuberance . Flirtatious young people ? and it is quite possible to flirt with your husband ? do not need Freud to point out the connection between the two . Furthermore , the question of age again enters . Doubtless when we have children of our own and more responsibilities , some of this blithe atmosphere will dissipate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sublime and subtle thing to which few attain ? and from which those few are constantly descendng to the dull details of existence ? Such details are dull no longer . This very happiness leaves a residue of sheer animal spirits which play in and out among them in all sorts of trivial , often silly , always salutary ways . Fun is not quite the same thing as humor . But even a bride and groom are not entirely unable to appreciate the incongruous and the unexpected . My chronic inability to believe that I am presentable unless I have a particular kind of wave in my hair ( a wave which my husband , alas , is incapable of perceiving even when it is pointed out ) is a source of unfailing amazement and amusement to him . I , on the other hand , can never quite comprehend the solemnity and duration of the morning shave . It is a point worth noting because of the present-day " eyes open " attitude toward marriage . Undoubtedly the preparation of the average man and woman for this greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if young people are to be warned of its changes and difficulties they ought also to be apprised of its gay and buoyant aspects . The innumerable small surprises in the unfolding of another personality , the novelty , the frequent incredibility of the whole situation can supply more diversion than all the theaters in the world ? diversion , provided they do not produce ill-temper , conflict , and hurt feelings . And this brings us to those prodigious bugbears , The Adjustments of Early Married Life . The important thing about adjusting is not the adjustments but the mental attitude one brings to them . Persons about to be married need not spend time worrying about what these adjustments will be , for they can not possibly be foreseen . Of course in a general way it is plausible to assume that if you are a chorus girl you may not fit in easily with the private life of a cleric , and vice versa . But in most instances the problems will be altogether different from what you expected . For example , before I was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I dressed or even changed my hat I was inclined to throw things all over the room , so that by the time I departed it was the quintessence of untidy haste . But then there was always a maid to pick up the flung stockings , the dresses collapsed upon the floor . In depression marriages there is seldom such a maid . Moreover , during the course of our engagement a chance episode disclosed to me the appalling fact that my fiance was not only a neat person himself but that he was inclined to resent disorder in others . Instantly I was in a panic . I determined to break myself of a habit of many years ' standing during the remaining six weeks before our marriage . I made a herculean effort ? but in vain . What happened ? From the day I was married I began to hang up my clothes as regularly as though I had been doing it all my life . I could hardly believe that this should be termed an adjustment , for , far from making any effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? until I visited my family several months later and began to throw things about again ! It was a phenomenon which I shall not try to explain . On the other hand , there was the problem of temperature . I had never thought of temperature as a problem . During the few months before we were married we had seen each other at concerts , night clubs , and in the open air ? places where we had no control over the heat or cold . After our marriage what was my consternation to discover that he liked to live in an atmosphere that fairly made my teeth chatter . If he turned on the heat to please me beads of sweat stood out upon his brow . If I then opened the window to please him we were both miserable . Whatwas to be done ? We agreed that each of us was an extremist , and endeavored to moderate our preferences . But since I proceeded to acquire a long series of colds in the head , my husband in this case bore the brunt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what he considers a semi-tropical climate . Again there was the question of his work . Before I was married I could not possibly have imagined being jealous of a man 's job . I had always been attracted to hard workers , and since I had work of my own I not only understood how absorbing it can be but also believed that I should never want for occupation when my husband was busy . Well , we returned from our honeymoon . The abrupt change hum companionship all day long to merely in the evening is often more difficult than people who have not themselves been recently married realize . Shortly afterward my husband brought home a brief case and worked from the close of dinner till two or three in the morning . This happened the next night and the next . I forget whether it was the third or the fourth time that something , as the novelists say , snapped within me . I did not know whether to weep or to storm ? or to punish him later by withdrawing in my turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been away on vacation there would naturally be an abnormal accumulation of work , and that it was harder on him than on me . The one fact that I could see was that I wanted him and that he was absorbed in something else . To wax really hysterical and complain that he did not love me any more was but the next step . And this is where Havelock Ellis came in . It is common knowledge that a woman 's emotional life generally lies deeper than a man 's , that she is apt to be more difficult to arouse . As a result , Ellis points out , a bride who suddenly has opened up before her vast realms of physical and emotional capacity long hidden frequently feels the need of twenty husbands . If things have gone well the groom is generally appeased , the bride more stimulated than ever . Eventually she becomes adapted to the circumstance of having but one husband ? and that one likely to desert her now and then in the service of his profession . All this , when remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possibility that my romance had not died an early death after all , and I managed to control the outburst , not , I confess , without some aspect of strain . Now when I see a brief case come in the door I may deplore the competitive New York system but I no longer feel tempted to tantrums or tears . I know a man who falls in love frequently but is careful not to propose to a girl until be has tried her out for months and even years upon every conceivable topic and in all kinds of situations . Of course he sooner or later comes upon something which does not altogether please him . So he goes on to the next lady . Such a system of crossing bridges before they are reached proves nothing . Indeed it is precisely the differences , above all in the masculine and feminine points of view but also in the most trifling details , which give that richness , that three-dimensional quality to married life . IV If , then , individual problems can not be foreseen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago I had no idea . A good deal was said , somewhat vaguely , about consideration . There must be a give and take in marriage . Marriage is a fifty-fifty proposition . And so on . It all sounded frightfully dismal , like instructions to a pair of sulky childrenplaying croquet : turn and turn about and no fair cheating . The symbol of a more congenial approach was discovered in the expedient of the toothpaste cap . One day when we were on our honeymoon we picked up a magazine in a lounge and happened upon an article on marriage which we promptly , read . In discussing this same matter of adjustments the author said that her husband 's habit of failing to screw the cap on the toothpaste tube used to annoy her intensely . Finally she told him about it and now , it seems , he screws it on so tight she can scarcely get it off . This , she said , was just one of those small adjustments which mean so much to the success of any marriage . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the watch ; for before long we were solving uncertainties by asking , " Is that a toothpaste cap ? " This became both a joke and a useful custom . It could also be applied the other way round . " I have a toothpaste cap , " I announced one night with some trepidation . Another time he had one . Mine was that his cavalier manner of driving a car gave me the jitters ; his , that he abominated my favorite whole-wheat bread . It becomes increasingly evident that in marriage it is not enough to meet a person half way . Such is the standard of business : you do something for me and I 'll do something for you . Rather , as Wordsworth said in extenuation of a king who built a beautiful church at great expense , Give all thou canst ; high Heaven rejects the lore Of nicely-calculated less or more ; On earth one thing at least rejects it likewise and that is love . Love can not survive an atmosphere of calculation . I believe that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance in marriage , as is so commonly asserted , but the tendency to treat love as though it were a commodity like sugar or creana which you , as an efficient housewife or shopkeeper , may bargain over and dole out in such quantities as you see fit . Love will not be bound in this way ? or in any way . But if you beat the other person to it by volunteering , " Is that a toothpaste cap ? " you have not only made the adjustment easier on both sides but you have also added fuel to your mutual emotion . There is so much pettiness in the world that love is the one place where man expects and longs to be quit of it . And how seldom he is ! Usually because the two people will not sufficiently trust and submit to each other . What the psychologists call " giving up one 's narcissism " is the same thing as losing one 's life in order to find it . Normal adult marriages are built upon this principle . Apparent exceptions only prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some spoilt and selfish women who will consistently abuse the generosity of those they love . Yet even here the concept of marriage as a fifty-fifty proposition only makes things worse ; for it leads inevitably to asserting one 's rights , which leads in turn to constant quarrels .. The wisest thing that was said to us when we were engaged was that there are no rights in marriage , only obligations . The extreme selfish types can be dealt with in a variety of ways , and since they make good dramatic material they have been much exploited by fiction and the funny papers . The average couple should ignore them . The mistake of asserting one 's rights , of invoking an atmosphere of justice , is similar to the mistake of making a fetish out of logic or reason . I know a recently divorced couple each of whom would tell you portentously that the other was " so unreasonable . " In spite of , or possibly because of , the fact that they were both highly intellectual persons engaged in scientific research , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely damning . Which of them was really unreasonable ? Suppose they both were . The structure of marriage does not depend upon the foursquareness of each brick but upon the mortar that holds them together . Being reasonable is a poor standard if only because things you think unimportant may be vital to the other person . Indeed , our idiosyncrasies are often more deeply rooted than anything else . Undoubtedly my husband thought me unreasonable to be frightened by the way he drove a car . He might have argued that he had never had an accident , that other people admired his driving , that I ought to get over being fidgety . I might have argued that he ought to grow to like whole-wheat bread , that it is both cheaper and better for you than white bread . . . . Life is too short . Unreason we have always with us : a man 's fatigue , a woman 's nerves , illness ? in all of these it may appear , vanish , and reappear . But love understands it and is charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man of the world tells us . I know a man who is sometimes so drunk with his own sense of importance that his statements are imbecile ? you would not believe he could be the power he is in business . But his wife understands and does not attempt to reason with him . I knew a woman who was periodically so nervous that no drunkard in the world could vie with her for sheer perversity and abrupt changes of mood , contentious one moment , sentimental the next , sullen the next . But her husband did not understand this , and invariably argued with her with all the heat and eloquence of a district attorney whose trained mind was being affronted by post hoc fallacies . Since these occasions had no patent connection with her physical life , the woman , though intelligent and " educated , " knew no more than the man what was at the bottom of their quarrels . There is much to be said about quarrelling . I have sometimes thought that pacifists would get farther if they talked less about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pleasures of war . If domestic strife were all unpleasant there would not be so much of it . But arguments lead so imperceptibly , first to occasional quarrels , then to constant bickering , that many people are not even aware that their marriage lacks completely that deep and sustaining factor ? harmony . They would be the first to tell you that they were happy ; and I dare say they are for they enjoy quarrelling . If you told them so they would say , " Oh , but we are n't quarrelling ! We 're just expressing our opinions . " I know a man who , to prove to his terrified children that his wrangles with his wife were not serious , told a story of two Irishmen in a regiment . They fought and nearly killed each other , but at their court-martial testified , in spite of their broken arms and bandaged skulls , that they were the greatest of friends and that their set-to 's meant nothing . " So you see , " said the narrator , " the bystanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst persons to judge of the extent of a quarrel are those concerned in it . There are other people who know that they enjoy quarrelling and do it deliberately . They are absurdly afraid of boredom . And it is such fun to kiss and make up ; there is such power in holding a person at arm 's length , in making him or her jealous , in " keeping him guessing . " Although really springing from a doubt of one 's power and a consequent need to be always proving it , this sort of thing might be all right if there were no one else in the case . I say nothing about the guest who is made uncomfortable ; the well-nigh incalculable harm done to children is another matter . Psychologists tell us that the parents ought to be the background of security for the child . Where they quarrel there is no security : anything may happen . If parents understood that many of the difficult traits which are such a trial to them in their children come from the fear and imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort before ever the children were born . For effort is required . Peace is something that must be valued and striven for by even the gentlest and most devoted of lovers . Love alone will not protect them : rather it makes them more prone to fight . A word of criticism , a mood of indifference even though quite unintentional , hurts most in someone we love . The chief causes of marital discord are said to be money , flirtation , and alcohol ; but I believe that more often than not they become excuses for quarrels the real root of which is purely emotional . It seems apparent that the attitude which is most practical and most productive of happiness in family life is based upon the principles of love and charity rather than upon those of justice and reason . V These words have a familiar ring . What do they stand for but the essence of Christianity ? May I remind the reader at this point that neither my husband nor I has been inside a church for years except on wedding occasions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals constantly and with interest in what passes for justice and reason . As to the questions of worship , and of the possibility of realizing Christian ideals in the world of affairs , I do not presume to an opinion . What I do assert is that marriages in which these principles are not followed , consciously or unconsciously , will fail . The charity to which I have referred ( not , of course , in the narrow sense of helping the poor ) signifies a mingling of love and compassion . Our sense of justice is not always reliable : for it perceives only apparent truth . Charity is an attempt to achieve the reality of justice by leaving a margin for that part of the truth which we can not see . What we usually call the sense of justice is a limited and average quality which most people have simply because they could not get through life without it . Unfairness and indiscriminate pity are both deviations from the norm . A child is the first to cry , " No fair ! " A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have despitefully used him . This has nothing whatever to do with the deliberate martyrdom we find so obnoxious . To see only masochism in Christianity is to miss the forest for the trees . The person who says , or whose attitude implies , " Go on : abuse me . I 'll return good for evil . I 'll get my reward " is a travesty on the Christian idea . If charity " suffercth long , and is kind , " in the very same sentence it " vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up . " Many psychologists and many laymen have been prejudiced by such cheap exploitation as appears in the above example , and have never bothered to search farther into the extraordinarily penetrating truths of the human heart which Christianity reveals . Still more prejudice possibly has resuited from the extravagant reverence for chastity displayed by so many Christian teachers . But deprecation of love between the sexes is no more essential to the genius of Christianity than the countenancing of perverted love is to the genius of Socratic philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were born . When all is said , what could be more appropriate than the philosophy of love for lovers ? Not one of the Christian virtues but has its spontaneous beginning in the love situation . Instances might be multiplied indefinitely did space permit : to love another as oneself sums it all up . The trouble is that unless we hold on to and re-enforce these impulses , they tend to scatter . Not , primarily , because people change and new situations arise . They do ; but the ideals of many lovers are discarded before the trousseau . The moment the first flush of involuntary generosity subsides they allow it to do so , sadly or cynically or pretending not to see it , as the case may be . They do not realize that to keep love they must follow the direction it has already indicated ; that the truest spontaneity , as my music teacher used to say , comes with practice . Of my white-haired old gentleman and my gentleman with glasses I should say that they both " date . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotional equipment , I believe to be an asset which every bride and groom should have . But to rear their young love to the full stature of marriage they can invoke no more quickening power than that of an active Christianity .
