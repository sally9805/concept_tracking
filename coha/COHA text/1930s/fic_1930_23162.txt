BORDERLAND A STORY BY ROLAND ENGLISH HARTLEY ARK walked slowly along the upper fringes of the beach , kicking savagely at the low hummocks of drooping grass . To think that he had ever liked coming to this place ! . . He found some comfort in remembering how long ago that was  --  years and years ago , when he was only a child , content to sit all day scooping out walled cities in the damp sand . Now , before long , he would be going to high school . The very thought of this pushed back the boundaries of life . A fellow could n't be expected any more to take much interest in sand and rocks and these stupid waves that came endlessly crashing against the shore . It was an added grievance that it was n't even summertime . In summer , of course , people had to go somewhere . But what in the world possessed mother to want to come down here now , in the late fall , when at home he and dad might have been going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study that night a few weeks ago to tell him of the plan , Mark could scarcely believe it at first . And then , " What about school ? " he demanded , though this was far from being a usual preoccupation of his . " Mother thinks maybe she can find a tutor for you down there . " " What 's that ? " While dad explained , Mark sat tracing with his fingertips the outlines of the patch of light where it fell from the reading lamp on to the shining wood of the table . " I do n't think I want to go , dad , " he brought out finally . Dad reached across the table to lay a hand on his arm . " But you see , Mark , mother thinks she needs the change . And of course I ca n't go down there now . So that just leaves you to look out for mother and Charley . " Mark knew well enough that mother did n't require any looking-out . for from him ; but at least dad 's putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , all right then ; I guess I 'll go " ; and perhaps it was just this that dad had wanted . Well , they were down here now ; and mother did seem better for the change . At home she was usually tired . " Do n't bother me about that now , Mark ; I 've got a headache " was the response to most of his enthusiasms . Down here at Capistrano she was much more of a chum . It was fun to go walking with her along the beach in the early morning , when she wore her short khaki skirt and carried her limp straw hat in her hand , and the wind loosened curls of her bright shining hair and brought them blowing across her face . Oh , there were some nice things about Capistrano . The place would be all right , Mark thought , if it were n't for the people . Those uneven rows of cottages that stood sheltered behind the dunes and went straggling up the slopes among the pines were the homes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark thought of as " nuts . " Although there were newcomers now and then in the ranks , most of these men and women Mark had known since babyhood , seeing them summer after summer , and growing more and more , as he became more conscious of them as individuals , to resent their deviations from the normal  --  as this was established for him by dad and mother and the people one knew at home . But mother liked these people down here . " It is n't just the sea air ; it 's the atmosphere of the place , " she always said when she was accounting to a stranger for her exhilaration at Capistrano . Mark had thought that air and atmosphere meant pretty much the same thing ; but mother explained that atmosphere was people , and that 's what she liked down here . They had endless disputes about it . Any little thing would start the argument all over again , especially if Mark spoke of these people without the tone of respect that mother demanded . She might ask , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And if he answered , " That old fool Keldon " he would have to listen for half an hour to her outraged championship of Capistrano 's poet . " But his coat is dirty . He spills things all down the front of it , " Mark might put in when he had a chance ; and then mother would inform him angrily that there were things that mattered vastly more than this , and that he was a stubborn , foolish boy always to be criticizing these people instead of making the most of this chance of being among them . Mother went back again and again to this point  --  of what he could learn from these people ; and Mark tried conscientiously , on many of his solitary walks , to think out what they had to teach him , but so far without any result . The only one of them that he could even like at all was Lanthier , the gaunt , black-haired musician , who sometimes took him for walks deep in the pine woods . But having invited him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked a few perfunctory questions and paid no attention to the answers , Lanthier would seem to forget all about him and go striding furiously among the trees , humming bits of tunes , so that Mark was hard put to it to keep him in sight . He liked these walks ; they had the savor of adventures . But what he could learn from Lanthier was not at all evident to him . Unless it might be bad manners . For if anyone , in Lanthier 's presence , mentioned the music of some man by the name of Wagner , Lanthier at once began shouting and waving his arms , as violently as Charley did in his " tantrums . " And then there was Miss Verley , who painted trees so that you could count every leaf on them even if they were a mile away ; and there was Pernet , who painted portraits of all the others , so that it was fun to guess who they were , with their faces and bodies flat like the sides of a house ; and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who was always reading aloud bits of his exclamatory prose . Mark had been hearing of this book for a great many years now , but had n't even seen the covers of it yet . No , Mark thought , as he came to the end of the beach and began scrambling up the rocks to the Point , they might be all right for mother , these people , but they did n't mean much to him . And the worst of it was , one could n't get away from them . All through the day some of them would be lounging or strolling on the beach , and at night everyone went to the hotel . If it was cool they sat inside , where a great fire of logs burned on the hearth ; if it was warm they sat on the porch . Inside or out , there was endless talk , most of which seemed to Mark much more silly than the prattle of the smallest children on the beach . The children , at least , talked of understandable matters , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then laughed loudly with a laughter as empty as their words . It made Mark very uncomfortable to see how completely mother became a part of this life . He did n't like to watch her when she was with these people , and yet he could n't look away . At the hotel at night he would try to make himself be interested in the dancing or in the play at the shuffleboard ; but before long he would be back where he could look in or out a window or door and see mother again ; and as he watched her with the others , wretched little shivers and fevers ran about his back . Many of the men called mother , Dorothy ; they drew their chairs very close to hers while they talked ; they leaned nearer sometimes and touched her hand lightly ; and she would be listening intently and nodding eagerly from time to time and looking back steadily into their eyes . When it came time for good-nights some one or other would hold mother 's hand so long at parting that Mark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenching painfully at his sides . Walking home , mother would tell him and Charley excitedly how this one or that had explained to her all about the new work he was doing , and how interesting it was , and how proud she was to be told of it ; and Mark , kicking at loose stones beside her , would blurt out , " He 's an old fool ! " And then there would be nothing but scolding for him until they got home . It was a comfort , these days , to think of dad and of the grave talks one hadwith him at home at night in the dim-lighted study . Dad would n't like these people , Mark was sure . Indeed , he could remember how when dad came down for a few days in the summertime they scarcely saw these people at all . They would have a boat those days and go far out on the bay , fishing ; or they would get horses and go riding , all four of them , way up into the woods . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the hotel with them ; and dad had smiled and said , " AII right , " and when he was there he had shaken hands with all the others . Mark had been very proud of dad , standing there straight and smiling quietly , among all those fussy people . But they did n't talk so much to him as they always did to mother ; and they did n't seem to like him , Mark had noted resentfully . He had overheard Gillam say something to Lanthier about " having the plutocrat with us . " He did n't know what plutocrat meant , but he thought they were talking about dad , and the tone made him angry . Afterwards , he had looked up the word . Plutocrat meant a man with a whole lot of money . It was foolish to call dad that ; just because he worked for a bank it did n't mean that all the money was his . Why , mother often told dad that they had almost nothing ! . . . Mark , as he climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now to agree with all his opinions . " They 're a lot of nuts , dad , " he said ; and dad answered , " They do seem a bit queer , son . And now there was this new fellow , Hugh Wayman . As Mark came to the level path along the Point and turned out toward the seaward tip , be began thinking about him . He looked all right ; there was no question of that . In his snug flannel shirt , with the sleeves rolled back to the elbows of his sun-bronzed arms ; with his bared head of short dark hair and his smiling gray eyes , he looked like a fellow that Mark could like . And then he had to talk like all the others ! They had encountered Wayman on one of the first mornings after their arrival . Mark and Charley , with mother between them , were running along the beach where the sand was wet and hard , and the spent waves sent their frothy tongues stealthily up to catch at one 's feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Point when they saw old Keldon coming down toward them from the rocks and a stranger with him . Keldon had n't seen mother since they arrived , and he greeted her with that comradely tone that Mark hated . " It 's a happy mother who can be a sinter to her boys , Mrs. Treadway . " Mother gave her two hands into his which he held out and smiled back into his eyes and said , " Youth must be battled for , you know . " That 's the way people talked at Capistrano . Now what was the sense in saying things like that ? Mark turned away in disgust to where Charley had found a withered starfish . But then he heard Keldon call out , " Hugh " and looked back to see the stranger coming nearer . Keldon introduced him floridly and Mark caught some of the phrases . " Living with me . . writing plays . great promise . " The new young man made a low bow over mother 's hand . " I 've already heard a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling Hugh , " Keldon put in , " that you come like sunshine to Capistrano , to warm our budding talents . " " And some of our poor frail buds , " Wayman added , " need such a lot of sunshine ! " Mark turned his back squarely on them , to saunter away to Charley . If they insisted on talking like that , afellow could n't be expected to listen . But mother , when she presently called them back to her and turned toward home , was happy and excited . " Was n't that a nice thing that Mr. Keldon said about me ? " she demanded . When Mark only brought out a " Huh ! " mother went on gaily , " It makes me very happy to think that I can be a little . .. inspiration to people who are doing these wonderful things . " Mark stooped to pick up a shell and flung it widely from him . " I never heard dad talk about inspiration and all that nonsense , " he muttered . Mother seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , " it does n't take inspiration to make investments for a bank . " " I bet it takes a lot more sense , " Mark answered ; and he had the satisfaction of the final word , for mother only looked at him and shook her head hopelessly . Well , that had been about a week ago , and all the days between had been about the same , and here he was this morning , strolling out on to the Point and less conscious of the glittering , heaving sea beneath him than of his dissatisfaction and his longing to be away from all this , back at home with dad . " Hello there , Mark , " he suddenly heard someone call from the rocks above the path . It was Mildred . He stood quite still . He felt very warm all over , but there were little shivers running wider the warmth . " Do n't you want to come on up for a while ? " He could see only her head up there among the rocks . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath was quick and heavy hi his throat . " You 're a great one for always staying by yourself , " Mildred greeted him when he came to her in the sun-flooded nook . She had spread a blanket there on the rough sand and sat back against a rock , with books scattered about her . Mark dropped on to a low stone and bent over to examine his shoe . " Yeh , " he said , and pulled painstakingly at a minute sliver of leather . When at last he looked up to her she met his eyes for an instant with a bright smile and then turned from him to watch some seagulls flying . Mildred Newell . How strange it was that words like these could mean , at different times , such very different things . For many years they had meant only a long-legged girl who used to come and watch the younger children at their play . Mark remembered that once she had kicked down his sand castles , and he had thrown shells at her ankles . Then all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She became more sedate and sat among the elders . And then , by another sudden transformation , she was one of those young ladies who did n't seem to find anything better to do than stroll endlessly with young men along the beach . Mark , in these later years , had scarcely separated her in his thoughts from the other strolling and dancing and swimming young ladies . Her one distinction in his mind was that she was one of those rich Newelis who lived in the great house among the pines above the Cove . And now , this year . . Mildred Newell . . . there were no words he had ever heard that could stir him like these . There was no happiness he had ever known to compare with being beside her . And yet it was a happiness torn by strange flurries of unrest . When he talked to her , at any moment his words might be cut off by that odd feeling that tightened his throat and sent the hot blood flooding his cheeks .. But now she had taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to her . He could sit silently beside her and watch her unobserved . He looked at the shadows that fell from her lashes to darken her brown eyes . He followed the intricate weavings of her dark massed hair . He let his slow caressing gaze pass along the outlines of her face , down from the brow along the straight clear line of the nose , then the sweet out-curving of the lips , and the chin , and the throat , down to where the warm skin was lost under soft folds of delicate and mysteriously fascinating fabrics . His whole body was trembling now . He was throbbing with the desire to throw himself down there beside her , with his fingertips reached out to touch her hand . He wanted to lie there and never move away . Nothing could soothe the turmoil in him but to lie there through the ages , to be beaten with blows and chilled with cold as he lay there , and never to draw away his fingertips from her hand . Suddenly her eyes came up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny boy , Mark . What are you thinking of , all the time ? " " Thinking . . . thinking . . . ? " Whatever thoughts he had were whirled tumultuously away . Mildred laughed lightly . " It 's almost lunch-time , is n't it ? We 'd better be getting on toward home . " He helped her gather up her books and shake out and fold the blanket . Then he walked with her , carrying all the burden loosely and once in a while dropping a book . It was a little easier to talk now , walking beside her . Mildred wanted to know what he thought of some of the people , and he did n't hesitate to tell her that they were " nuts . " " Have you met Mr. Wayman yet ? " she asked . " Yes . " When he did n't say anything more , BORDERLAND 7e5 she went on , " And what about him ? " " Oh , lie looks all right , " Mark told her , " but he talks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expected of people down here , you know , " Mildred explained , laughing . And by now they had come to the gateway of heavy logs where her road turned in . Mark never went with her beyond this point , for Mrs. Newell had a way of scrutinizing a fellow as if he were some strange and not altogether trustworthy insect . At home he found mother and Charley already nearly through with their lunch . " Where you been ? " Charley wanted to know . " I 've been . .. talking to Mildred Newell . " The room seemed to him to fill with music as he spoke her name . " Huh ! " And Charley bit deep into his jelly-laden bread as one who knows the desirable things of life . Mother filled his cup with fragrant , steaming chocolate and then she said , " I 've been waiting for you to come , Mark , to tell you both what I 'm planning . I 'm going to get Mr. Waynian as a tutor for you . " Mark set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . not him ! " " What 's a tutor , anyway ? " Charley demanded . " He 's going to come and help you with your studies , " mother explained patiently . " I think we 're very , very lucky to find someone like that . " Charley 's round , fat little face was contorted with disapproval . " Oh , gee , mother ! I thought we came down here for some fun ! I met a kid this morning who told me where there 's lots of abalones , and he says there 's a fisherman at Three Mile Beach that takes kids out in his boat . And now I suppose I 've got to sit around here all the time studying . Do n't you remember , I got a headache once last year from studying ? " But mother was smiling on in her secure way ; and Mark , on his side of the table , was making up his mind to be so maddeningly stupid that that fellow would n't last for long . A half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few rooms of their cottage , his hands before his mouth as if they held a horn , shouting , " Toot-er , tooter-er , toot-er ! " in tones of deep derision ; but even this insult had no power to keep their destiny from them . At ten o'clock in the morning Wayman was there , and it was understood that he was to hold the boys to their studies until noon . Though Mark had carefully prepared his stubborn defiance , he found it very soon yielding to his growing liking for the man . Wayman quickly revealed the intelligent and human point of view that studies were a good deal of a nuisance , to be got through with as expeditiously and pleasantly as possible . He even admitted that grammar was nonsense . After that Mark could n't help respecting him . And Charley responded warmly to the personal yarns that he mixed among his teachings . But when mother asked at noon how things had gone , they answered with flat unenthusiasm , " Oh , all right . " It was as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayman came to them now , and gradually more and more lanterns were lighted along the dark ways of scholarship . Mark would have found increasing satisfaction in these studies if only it were n't for mother . She was acting toward Wayman now as she did toward all the Capistrano people , with that air of intimate understanding that distressed Mark so greatly . He could n't see why she should want to smile into their eyes as she did and sigh and exclaim over their confidences and suffer their comradely closeness . Mark always 726 HAR PER 'S MONTHLY MAGAZINE wanted to shout out at her when he saw her this way . It made his face burn ; he felt humiliated , as if she were displaying a lightness somehow to his own discredit . Hugh Wayman usually came to the cottage in the morning some time before the beginning of lessons ; and then he and mother , in the sitting room or on the porch , would talk in Iow tones , while Mark paced restlessly through the rooms waiting for ten o'clock to strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to them , mother had said , " It is n't time yet , Mark " so sternly that he knew he was n't wanted there . Wayman was writing a new play . He had told the boys so . Maybe that 's what he and mother found to talk about so long . Maybe that 's why mother leaned near to him , with her eyes on his as he talked , and murmured , " Splendid ! " and " Oh , that 's wonder-ful ! " Pretty soon Wayman began bringing hits of the play to read to mother . Then the lessons did n't even begin at ten . One day Mark went in and out of the room a dozen times , and they did n't even seem to see him there . Finally he took his stand in front of them and brought out hoarsely , " Are n't we ever going to have lessons this morning ? " They jumped up at once then , laughing gaily together . And when it was found that Charley had taken advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at all , but only laughed more merrily than ever . To go away from home these days to the sunny nook in the rocks and to find Mildred there was like throwing off cares and finding blessed soothing . He would sit for long and watch her as she read , and sometimes his eyes would grow misty with tears . Again and again he would say her name to himself . Mildred , Mildred . It was like a gentle hand laid upon him . He wantedto say it thousands , tens of thousands of times , to keep on and on murmuring to himself , Mildred , Mildred  --  and then no hurt could reach him . When they talked it was of trivial things . Mildred insisted upon asking often about his studies . She seemed to like to hear even the most unimportant details . " You like Mr. Wayman better now , do n't you ? " she said one day . Mark 's tone was so doubtful when he answered slowly , " Yes . . . I like him all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll like him better the more you know him , " she said briskly , as if to balance his own lack of ardor ; and after a moment she added , " Your mother thinks he 's fine . " Mark looked deep into her eyes for the misted glint of meaning that was hidden there when people meant more than they said ; but Mildred 's gaze was frank , and he looked away again quickly , with a little shiver of relief . One day when he came to Mildred in the rocks he found Wayman with her there , sprawled out comfortably on the spread blanket . Mark hung back a moment , while a harsh flurry of resentment and distress ran through him . " Come on , Mark , " Mildred called out to him , across the last low barrier of rough stone . Wayman , with his head propped on his arm , blinked drowsily at him . " I guess Mark sees enough of me in the morning . " Then Mark went forward to them slowly , and Mildred was especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease until Wayman got to his feet , stretched largely , mumbled , " See you folks later , " and went whistling away from them . Then Mildred seemed a little cross , accusing Mark of crossness . " You act just as if you did n't like him , " she said . And all that Mark could answer was , " I do n't know . " His spirit was darkly clouded with this failure to know , to understand this new world that was drawing about him in place of the old world he had known . There was even no joy in being with Mildred now . Soon he Left her and went among the dunes on the far side of the Point , where there would be no people . He wanted no one near him until his mind was cleared of this echoing " I do n't know . . I do n't know . " Just a year ago life had been so simple ; and now , wherever one turned , there was only confusion and doubt . It was n't fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . A fellow was entitled to some reasonable treatment at the hands of life . He should be allowed to go along clearly marked paths , as he had always gone before , instead of losing himself in all these tangled coverts of uncertainty . Coming home from this troubled walk , it was comforting to find everything quite unchanged . One had had a torturing fear that suddenly the tumult within one might seize hold on all the stable things of life . But here was mother , setting the supper things on the table ; and here was Charley , trudging relentlessly after her to tell just exactly where and how the jellyfish was found . When they sat at table , a little later , Mark suddenly heard himself saying , " I do n't think dad would like Mr. Wayman very much . " He was at once filled with a great terror of the effect of his words . He drank water in short gulps until the glass was empty . But mother did not seem even to have heard ; and Charley , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating . In the evening they went to the hotel . Here , invariably , Mark felt his great disgust with the place flowingback over him . A year ago all this babble of voices had been only so much noise to him ; but now certain elements of the talk were beginning to disengage themselves , and more and more he hated it all . If people hushed their voices when he came near , he knew they were talking about Miss Merrill and that man in the cottage next to hers . The hush even more than the words he overheard made him fee/ that he was in the presence of ugly things . And now to-night the thought suddenly came to him : what if he should bear mother 's name spoken by these veiled voices ? He jumped up from his place on the stairs and went at once to find her . " Come down to the beach with Charley and me , " he urged , and urged so desperately that mother , laughing back at the group he took her from , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along the wooden path across the dunes . There was a low bit of moon that sent its light across the dark water and the wet sand . Charley at once began investigating that path of moonlight , but Mark held close to mother 's side . She was impatient with him for bringing her out here . " You 're getting so fussy these days , Mark . I ca n't understand it . " " I do n't like it down here , " he murmured . " That 's nonsense ! " " I wish we could go home . . . to dad . " " Well , you can just get that idea out of your head ! " He pressed closer to her . " Do n't lean on me that way , " mother said . But he stayed close beside her . He felt that he wanted to throw both arms around her . . . to protect her .. . against what , he did n't know . Mother seemed to feel his need and presently her arm came about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes grew foolishly moist . . . and of course the moisture had to go through mother 's thin dress , so that she held him quickly away from her , to see his eyes glinting in the moonlight . " Why , you funny boy ! What 's the matter ? " " I wish we could go home , " he said once more . And this made mother cross again . " We 've had enough of this moping out in the dark , " she said and called Charley to them and led the way back to the hotel . Next morning Hugh there even earlier than half hour before lesson gan reading bits of his play to mother , while Mark walked unhappily down to the dunes and back again , down to the dunes and back . Once when he came near the sitting-room window he did not hear their voices and went quickly to the porch to look in . Mother and Wayman were standing there together in the middle of the room . He held one of her hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low voice , " I 'm very happy about it , Hugh . I 'm very happy . " Mark scraped his feet noisily across the porch and went striding in to them . They were still standing there , but a little farther apart now . " It 's way past ten o'clock , " Mark announced accusingly . " I guess it is , all right , " Wayman said , with a nervous laugh . Mother went out to find Charley , and soon the three of them were at work in the little room . But lessons were not much of a success this morning . Mark could n't remember from one minute to the next what the arithmetic problem was about ; and Way-man 's voice repeatedly trailed off to silence in the middle of an explanation . Finally he stood up . " Let 's call it a day . What do you say , boys ? . . . I ca n't seem to keep down on earth . " Charley needed no more to send him galloping out of the room ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard Wayman , sometime later on , go down the steps and away . That afternoon Mark walked again among the dunes on the other side of the Point . He could n't even go to Mildred now . He wondered if all his life he must be alone like this with his unrest . He wondered if people were always shut off from those about them by doubts and fears . When his legs grew weary from tramping in the heavy sand , he found a little hollow where he lay in the sunshine . . . and when he woke it was almost evening and quick-moving masses of fog were drawing their shadows about him . Then , after supper , it was time for the hotel again . He begged to be left at home ; but mother said he needed something to cheer him up ! He sat apart from the others , leaning across the railing , looking out to the pale moonlight on the sea . Strollers passing along the porch behind him dropped bits of talk into his ears . Here was Pernet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they would n't see him , huddled there in the dark . " And now our charming Dorothy . . . " Pernet was saying ; and what might have come next was lost in Lanthier 's mocking laugh . Mark held his clenched hands firmly to his sides and waited till they were well past before he slipped down from the porch , under the railing , to the soft sand . His face was burning so hotly that even his eyes felt afire . Mother 's name now , mixed up in this hateful talk ! He went on blindly and found himself before long following the path that ran out along the Point . Moonlight brightened the path and silvered the water far below , but the rocks were black and monstrous in the shadows . When he came to the verge of the headland , where the cliffs drop sheerly to the sea , he sat on a ledge that he knew , with his feet braced against the rock , and looked down into the pale wash of the waters . He looked and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his own white face looking up to him from the froth of the waves . The slow tears were moving down his cheeks . There did n't seem to be anything for him to do but go down there into the water . Then there would be an end to this burning distress . . . . And no one would care . He was just a nuisance to them all . He tried to remember every single time that anyone  --  dad or mother or Charley  --  had been out of patience with him . There was a grim satisfaction in the thought that no one would care . He could see very clearly how his cold , wet body would be drawn from the water , with the heavy hair clinging about his face . Perhaps they would cry a little , then , but they would n't really care . Leaning forward a little on the narrow ledge , he groped behind him till he found a small stone , that be tossed down from the cliff to see where anything would fall . It struck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned forward farther . . . and just then a heaving wave broke at the foot of the cliff and the outrushing water of its subsidence left bare a jagged rock , straight below , with its black , wet edges grim as steel in the moonlight . Mark 's hands tightened spasmodically on the rock . He threw back his weight from the edge . A dizzying sickness caught his senses . When he had crawled back higher among the rocks and lay there gripping them still with straining fingers , a cold sweat broke from all his body . He lay shivering and weak , with the sound of the sea in his ears , beating on those rocks . It was a long time before he gained courage to move . Then he crawled slowly up to the path . He felt ashamed to go home but eager to be there . He found that mother and Charley had n't come in yet ; probably they had n't even missed him at the hotel . He got quickly into bed to be there before their coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that very soon he fell asleep . Waking in the morning to see Charley 's round , red face stuffed into its pillow and to hear mother 's humming in the kitchen was like coming back to life from beyond the gates of death . He was filled with a new urgent tenderness toward them . All day he could scarcely let them out of his sight . Again and again mother scolded him for " treading on her heels " all about the house ; and when she summarily ordered him forth and he sought out Charley at play , he clung so closely that Charley began grumbling , " I do n't see why you 've got to hang around me all the time ! " But Mark 's unrest through all the next few days could be soothed only by being constantly near them . He was oppressed with the sense of approaching calamity . He brooded over his doubts and fears until he could see no outcome for them but sudden disaster . Every vague word he heard at the hotel at night became the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and Wayman burned deep into his consciousness . He was alert and tense with watching ; so it is no wonder that it took a very little thing to bring him to the breaking point . One mid-afternoon when he and Charley came into the house mother was n't there . Often she was not there when they came in , but this time all Mark 's fears came crashing about him . Something in him shouted , " Now it has come ! " He went from room to room calling " mother ! " in such a strained voice that at length Charley caught his panic and came trotting beside him with anxious round eyes . For all their searching , mother was not to be found . Then Charley , from the sitting room , called out , " Here 's a note . " Mark sprang toward him . " Give it to me , Charley ! Do n't read it ! Give it to me ! " His heart was throbbing in great leaps . He snatched the folded bit of paper from Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got a nerve . " Though he held the paper close to his eyes , Mark could n't read it . There was nothing here but blurs of shadow and jets of darting light . Only gradually the words emerged . " I 'm going over to Mrs. Newell 's for a little while . If you 're hungry , there 's custard in the cooler . " Mark dropped into a chair and covered his eyes with his hand . Two long , deep sobs broke from him . " What 's the matter , Mark ? What 's the matter ? " Charley began to whimper . Mark held the paper out to him . While Charley read slowly he sat looking hard at the floor , fighting back those sobs that crowded his breast and tightened his throat . Pretty soon Charley began to laugh , loud and scornfully . He took his stand directly in front of Mark , to make his scorn more fully felt , and went on laughing . " I 'd like to hear you ever call me a crybaby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent itself ; then he got up slowly and left the house . He wanted to find some place where he could be a crybaby . All this turmoil in him had to find some vent . As he went among the dunes , searching out some hidden nook , he came within sight of the Point ; and there , high up among the rocks , he saw a glimmer of white that must be Mildred . He had avoided her lately . He had felt compelled to be alone with the confusion of life . But now , suddenly , a great need for fellowship flooded over him . Now he knew that it would be no comfort to throw himself down in the hot sand and let these prisoned sobs escape . Now he must go to Mildred . Mildred had meant to him this year all the new beauty and mystery of life ; and if life had now grown threatening and harsh as well , he must find the soothing from Mildred . He felt none of the usual embarrassment when he came to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . But all the words that had come thronging to him as he climbed over the rocks , the words that were to be poured out to her to make her help him understand , all these were gone from him now . He could only sit beside her and look out over the sea to where a round white cloud was coasting along the horizon . He felt her hand on his arm . " You have n't been very happy lately , Mark . " He swallowed hard and answered , " I do n't like it very much down here . " " But is it as bad as all that ? " she said , with her gentle laugh . " I hate these people here , " he burst out hotly . Mildred made no answer to this and presently he went on , " Mother 's always saying how fine they are , but that 's just because she 's so silly about them . " The words were coming back to him now , with a rush . " Mother never acts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she wants to make such a fuss over these fools for . It makes me feel . . . kind of ashamed . And Mr. Wayman . . . " When he paused he could feel that Mildred 's eyes were fixed upon him , but he would not turn to meet them . After a moment she asked quietly , " What about Mr. Wayman ? " But Mark could n't answer for a while . The sense of loyalty to mother was asserting itself again , stronger than all the other feelings . " What about Mr. Wayman , Mark ? " Mildred presently asked again . " Oh , he just comes there all the time and they keep talking , that 's all . " Mildred sat silent and very still for a few moments and then she said , " I want to tell you , Mark . . Mr. Wayman and I are engaged . " He faced sharply about to her . " You 're going to get married . . . to him ? " Mildred laughed lightly . " Some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mark started to scramble to his feet , but Mildred 's arm came about him and held him close . He felt no tingle of exaltation but only a pervading ache . " Listen , Mark , " Mildred was saying , " we have n't told you about this before , because it 's a secret from everyone , you see . We do n't want it talked about because we may not be married for a long time  --  not till Hugh gets really started with his work . And you know what a great place this is for talk . We do n't want to be mixed up in that . Your mother is the only one that knows . She and I have been such good friends for years . And I had to tell some one . . . . That 's what Hugh and your mother find to talk about so much , I guess . He says he must talk to someone about me . " And now , when her quiet words came to an end , Mildred lifted her hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him on the forehead . And then Mark jumped up and went quickly away from her , down across the rocks . Mother was there when he got home . He burst into the room where she satand ran across to her and dropped down beside her on the floor to bury his face in her lap . He could feel her hands in his hair , trying to turn his head so that she could see his face . " Mark I What 's the matter , Mark ? " After a while he turned his face , still pressed against her , only enough to let him speak . " Mildred 's going to marry Mr. Way-man . " " Yes , Mark . " " She told me just now . " " Yes . . . . She said she wanted to tell you soon . " " She told me . . . and then she kissed me . " " Mildred 's a dear girl . " " I do n't see what she kissed me for . " Mother 's arm tightened about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mildred likes you , Mark . " " But she likes him better ! " Mother 's only answer to that was the slow stroking of his hair . Mark raised his face a little more from her lap . " I do n't see why people always have to be that way  --  doing things they do n't really mean  --  kissing people when they like somebody else better . . and talking to people as if they liked them more than they do .. . and . . and always acting that way . And Mr. Wayman was always coming here , and you were talking to him like that , and . . . " Her hands were on his shoulders and she was shaking him roughly now . " Mark ! What do you mean ? " " Well , he was always coming here , and I did n't know he liked Mildred , and you were always talking to him that way , and I could n't help thinking . . . " She lifted him up to face her , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mark ! " She gave his shoulders another shake . " You did n't think that ! " Then she laughed brokenly and caught him fiercely to her . " Oh , you funny , funny boy ! " She held him now with his cheek pressed against hers , and be felt that her cheek was wet . He tried to pull away , but she gripped him closer . Her breath came in hot little bursts against his neck . " Do n't , mother , do n't , " he pleaded . Still she held him close , and he could feel the pressure of her lips against his hair . " I guess something 's been the matter with me , " he mumbles ! . " My head 's been kind of funny lately . " " My poor , funny boy ! " she whispered . He drew far enough out of her clasp to turn and pat her wet face . " Let 's go home , mother . " " Yes . I want to go home too , Mark . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , mother ? " " Yes , Mark . I want to go . " He jumped up and ran to the door . " Charley ! " he shouted . " Where are you , Charley ? Hooray ! We 're going home !
