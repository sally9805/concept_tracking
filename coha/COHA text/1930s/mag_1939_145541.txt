Ever since 280 B.C. , when 70 learned Jews of Alexandria translated the Old Testament from Hebrew into Greek ( the Septuagint ) , tinkering with the Holy Bible has been a prime occupation of scholars . The King James Version , most familiar to the English-speaking world ( ordered by the late Queen Elizabeth 's pious , witch-hunting successor ) , is a 17th-Century revision in the light of then available Greek and Hebrew texts . The Revised Version ( 1881 , 1885 ) was meant to bring the Bible up to date ; the Goodspeed-Smith " American " Bible of a few years ago did so even more thoroughly .
