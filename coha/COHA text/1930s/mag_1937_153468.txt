In the last days of King Edward VIII 's reign , a London stage revue was considered daring and excruciatingly funny because one of the characters was frequently addressed as " Miss Simpson . " Music hall and radio comedians throughout the United Kingdom fairly itched to utter the words " Mrs. Simpson " in any connection whatsoever , and these British funsters were still itching without relief when , last week . Miss Joan Young , author of a British Broadcasting Corp . radio revue called Masculine Fame on Parade , took her place to conduct this performance . The B. B. C. Variety Orchestra struck up . Itching intolerably , Comedian John Rorke stood by waiting his cue while the chorus sang : <P> We 've come along this evening And one and all we feel We wish that you could see us For we 've all got sex appeal . <P> As the last line went out over the ether waves , listeners by the million were startled to hear a loud voice bellow " YES , MRS . SIMPSON ! " <P> Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too good , the moment too irresistibly apt , for his British sense of humor . Within 30 seconds every telephone line into the modernistic , ship-shaped B. B. C. Building was jammed with the furious complaints of British radio listeners who had never before heard " Mrs. Simpson ' ' uttered on the air . The Duke of Windsor in his B. B. C. abdication broadcast called her simply " the woman I love . " Almost instantaneously last week a B. B. C. technician had cut the broadcast , but just too late . <P> " We must apologize to listeners , " came the B. B. C. announcer 's voice a few moments later , " for the apparent bad taste shown . " <P> " I was terribly upset ! " moaned Authoress Joan Young . " There was nothing regarding Mrs. Simpson in my script . I was shocked and astounded ! I can not say anything more , as the B. B. C. will not allow me to . " <P> Comedian . John Rorke , having eased his itch , was overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. job , and with remorse . Distractedly he said he had meant to shout " YES , MRS . GIBSON ! " although that was also no part of the script . " It was a slip of the tongue , " he moaned inconsolably . " I would not say anything out of place about any living being , my former King or a peasant . " <P> The stern B. B. C. sentence pronounced upon Shocker Rorke was suspension for five weeks , during which time he may not enter any B. B. C. broadcasting studio .
