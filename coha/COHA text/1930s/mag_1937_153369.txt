Jimmy Walker paid $500 for a pair of Blue Azore chickens to take down to his new farm on Long Island . An addled architect wrung the neck of a prize gamecock , tried to make off with it under his coat . But the prime news of this annual gathering of fowl fanciers , the biggest in 23 years , was its display of the largest number of ornamental pheasants ever exhibited at a U. S. show . <P> Few years ago fancy pheasants were as rare in the U. S. as the four-volume mono graph on Pheasants , Their Lives and Homes-by William Beebe , published in 1918-22 at $250 per set and now a collec tor 's item at $750 . Brilliantly-plumed birds could be seen on the lawns of ty coons like Bethlehem Steel 's Eugene Grace , but to most citizens a pheasant was only a long-tailed wild bird useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been re-issued in one volume at $3.50* and pheasant raising has become a fad among rich rural connoisseurs . With only five pairs entered in last year 's Poultry Show , a handful of fanciers organized an Ornamental Pheasant Society , set out to advertise their pastime . Chosen president was Philip Morgan ( " Phil " ) Plant , onetime Manhattan playboy and second husband of Constance Bennett , who settled down few years ago to breed bantams and pheasants on his 2,000-acre farm in Waterford , Conn .

" They 're just to look at , " explains Fancier Plant . " They might replace peacocks that people keep in penthouses . They 're like a miniature peacock , but they 're more dainty . There are 56 varieties . Hell , there are only five or six kinds of peacocks . " <P> * Doubleday , Doran.
