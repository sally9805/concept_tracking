POEMS OF PEOPLE-Edgar Lee Masters -Appleton-Century ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE PEOPLE , YES-Carl Sandburg- Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> Twenty years ago two gifted free-verse poets who became prominent at about the same time were widely hailed as among the most original spirits in the emerging group of Midwestern writers . Two more dissimilar talents have seldom been found in the same school . Edgar Lee Masters was a gruff , hardbitten , Kansas-born lawyer whose poems were bitter epitaphs on the wasted lives of a small town . Carl Sandburg , cheerful , intuitive , sentimental , had worked as a porter in a barber shop , sceneshifter in a theatre , truck-handler in a brickyard , a dishwasher , harvest hand , Social-Democratic Party organizer , newspaperman . As Edgar Lee Masters followed Spoon River Anthology with poems cut in the same pattern , but increasingly dry and progressively longer , Sandburg followed Chicago Poems with his songs of labor in Smoke and Steel , with tributes to the physical beauty of the U. S. in Slabs of the Sunburnt West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same period , Sandburg writing his colloquial children 's tales , Rootabaga Stories , Masters his cycle of thesis novels . Both wrote biographies of Lincoln , Sandburg picturing him as the greatest U. S. hero , Masters seeing him as the wrecker of the Union . Last week these two poets signalized their return to verse with volumes of tributes to the people . Saluting them for different reasons , each had a different crowd in mind . <P> To most readers , there is likely to be no question as to which has made the happier choice of subject . In Poems of People Edgar Lee Masters lapsed into stock poetic attitudes in writing of Washington at Fraunces ' Tavern , Jefferson , Martin Van Buren , Daniel Boone , De Soto . Only in Andrew Jackson does he carry out the promise of his title , calling up <P> The People hungry , ignorant , despoiled ; The People in want , however much they toiled ; The People smelling , cockeyed and crazy . <P> who entered the White House with Jackson , where " they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 286-page volume in which no such signs of aloofness are apparent . As Sandburg 's most ambitious poetic venture , it has little in common with the fragmentary , glancing , impressionist verses that won him his reputation , stands superior to them in originality and wit . One of the chief critical charges brought against Sandburg has been that he lacked an integrated philosophy that would guide his writing , that his poems have too frequently been mere expressions of moods , descriptions of street and industrial scenes , echoes of stray opinions overheard in crowds . As a poet he has been like a radio tuned in on several stations at once , getting bits of preaching , bits of political talk , bits of good music , bits of the chattering , discordant static of U. S. urban life . These several voices he has never before fused into a program that made sense or symmetry . With The People , Yes , he comes close to doing so , and the book narrowly misses a place with the best of U. S. poetry . Written with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , unstudied , lower-class humor , it succeeds in making " the people " a hero worth a poet 's tribute .
