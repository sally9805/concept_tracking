txt Important statements by ? several ' French Ministers during the past day or two indicate unusual activities in the matter of the French armament program . France is to build two 35,000-ton battleships immediately , according to a statement made by William ) 3ertratich Minister of the Navy , more the Naval Commitee of the French Chamber yesterday . The Committee approved his stand for a ' bigger navy to meet Italian competition in the Mediterranean and passed a resolution requesting the dovernment to submit to Parliament at the earliest possible moment details as to its new and enlarged naval program . Government 's Aim Nevertheless , the Government is trying its best to prevent the burden of its enlarged program from falling on the production end of the nation 's industry . In a statement last Tuesday , Paul Marchandeau , Finance Minister , said that a series of decrees , already approved by Premier Camille Chautemps , would be submitted to the next Cabinet meeting . Some of these are intended to ease taxes on general production and others are intended to lift cerExpansion Plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By a Stall Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor WASHINGTON , Feb.10 ? Development of the opposition to the $800,000,000 naval expansion program was carried forward In public today with a declaration that it is a " definite step on the road to war " while behind the scenes it grew increasingly apparent that Secretary of State Cordell Hull and President Roosevelt have not succeeded in allaying congressional or public suspicion that something more is intended by the program than national defense . Frederick J. Libby , Executive Secretary of the National Council for the Prevention of War , a leading opponent of the big navy movement here , took the witness stand before the Naval Affairs Committee charging that the President in his Chicago speech " embarked on a policy of threat and bluff which can end only in humiliation or war . " He declared that the naval expansion program was a part of this policy , not a national defense measure , and Insisted that " when you threaten another nation and it does not yield to threat , you must either back down or fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Com- mittee Secretary Hull , it is learned , Is calling individual members of Congress to his office , devoting much time to each one and attempting to persuade each in his earnest manner that there is real fundamental danger to the United States in the current world situation , and that the only way to make sure the nation will not be involved in war is to help prevent the outbreak of war . He explains to each that the naval program is a purely national defense measure in thiS sense , namely , that it is essential to the success of a policy which would discourage aggression and therefore keep war away from the United States . He has had some success in persuading his callers to see his point of view . It is apparent at , the naval hearings that a majority of the members of the Committee have accepted it . But it is also learned that among his callers are at least three who have reacted entirely contrary to Secretary Hull 's intention and have gone over to opposition In the belief that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volving American involvement abroad , Isolationists Aroused It is perfectly clear that traditional isolationism in Congress has been seriously aroused and is in an insistent and questioning mood . Even in the Naval Committee itself there is sufficient demand for , more enlightenment to require some clarification as a prerequisite to Committee approval . During the morning hearings Representative Ralph 0 . Bi ewster IR ) of Maine , demanded that Arthur Krock , New York Times columnist , be summoned before the 1Committee for questioning as to the source of his information that there is an intangible naval understanding between the United States and Great Britain . " I demand that we call Mr. Krock before this Committee to tell us where he gets this information that we can not get , " he said . " Are we mice or are we men ? " Discussion Is Ended The chairman of the Committee ended the matter with a suggestion that it be settled in an executive session . Mr. Libby 's testimony was the main feature of the day 's hearing . Citing a number of editorials from newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour he said in part : " Your Committee is doubtless fully aware of the uneasiness in the country of which these references to typical newspapers are indicative . We believe that the President in his Chicago speech embarked upon a policy of threat and bluff which can end only in humiliation or war , " Mr. Libby contended that the State Department should be asked other questions than those recently put to it . " If this country is pursuing a parallel course with Great Britain to safeguard international treaty rights in China or consulting for the purposes of concerted action to serve the joint purposes of the United States and the British Empire , " he said , " the consequence to our country of carrying this policy through to its logical conclusions is to involve us unnecessarily in the wars both of Asia and of Europe . " Peaceful Adjustments If the U. S. rejects a policy of concerted action to settle world problems by war , Mr. Libby urged , its influence will be exerted on the side of " an alternative constructive policy of peaceful adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of Congress , the State Department , and the whole country of the van Zeeland report . He concluded : " In rejecting a British alliance or parrallel action with Britain as against other nations , we reject at the same time the policy now branded as ' isolation . ' To borrow from the ** Chautauqua speech , ' We are not isolationists except insofar as we seek to isolate ourselves completely from war . ' International economic co-operation , ' Collective action ' with and not against certain nations , the President 's ' good neighbor ' policy persevered in toward all nations  --  these are the policies which seem to us to be in the plain interest of the United States , and not only of the United States . They seem to us to offer hope , and perhaps the only hope , for ultimate peace . " We oppose , therefore , the supplementary navy program as a definite step on the road to war and as making more difficult those peaceful adjustments that we regard as essential to world peace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government plan is to relieve from production tax the proportion of goods which has been produced above the level of the preceding year , thus constituting a premium on increased production . At the same time M. Marchandeau indicated that the exchange equalization fund would play its part in financing the armament program . This fund 4is to be reinforced by the restoration of a fund of approximately 4,500,000,000 francs , ceded by the equalization fund to the Bank of France last fall to aid in repayment of the British loan . This amount of gold has now been placed once again at the disposal of the fund to Mid it in defending the franc , Royal Visit Stresses Close Ties That Bind France and England By a Staff Correspondent of The Chrtstion Science Monitor LONDON , Feb ** forthcoming state visit to France of King George and Queen Elizabeth is viewed here as yet another indication of the close ties which bind the two western democracies in the social as well as the political field .
