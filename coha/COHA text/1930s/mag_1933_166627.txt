Playing Safe . At the end of the week in which Jimmie Mattern airily promised to circle the earth from and to Floyd Bennett Field , N. Y. ( TIME , June 12 ) he was in Khabarovsk . Far Eastern Siberia , so utterly exhausted by a grueling flight across sea and land that he could not even answer newsmen . With all chance gone of beating the 8-day globe record of Post &; Gatty he now was trying to make the best possible solo record , yet heeding the cabled exhortations of his backers to " take it easy and play it safe . " Sorriest mishap of Mattern 's flight across the steppes occurred east of Omsk when a fuel line in his Lockheed plane broke . Dizzy and nauseated from breathing gas fumes . Pilot Mattern set his ship down at the coal mining settlement of Belovo , so groggily that it cracked the stabilizer . He lost a day and a half there before mechanics , flown from Novosibirsk , completed repairs . For the treacherous 2,600-mi. hop from Khabarovsk across the Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nome . Pilot Mattern steeled himself with plenty of rest . <P> Cuatro Vientos ( ' ' Four Winds " ) is the name of the military airport near Madrid where , three years ago , Major Ramon Franco ( ' ' The Spanish Lindbergh " ) led a dramatic but abortive revolt by 500 Spanish aviation officers and enlisted men . One of Major Franco 's followers was Lieut . Joaquin Collar . Last week at Tablada Airdrome , near Seville , Lieut . Collar and Captain Mariano Barberan , bald-pated air hero of the Moroccan war , climbed into a long-snouted Breguet biplane named Cuatro Vientos . Lumbering beneath an enormous fuel load ( 1,400 gal. ) the plane took more than a half-mile run to get off . In an hour it was over the ocean . For a day , a night , and another day the plane roared westward across the Atlantic like a perfectly aimed projectile to the eastern tip of Cuba , settled down at Camaguey , flew on to Havana . The nonstop distance over water , 4,500 mi. , was second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. ( 4,800 mi . ) . <P> " Last Flight . " A late afternoon breeze blew suddenly in from squally Lake Michigan , whipping up violent swells in front of the seaplane ramp at the Chicago World 's Fair . Said an employe of the airplane sightseeing service to the pilot : " Do you think it 's safe for landings ? " Replied Pilot Carl Vickery : ' ' I 'll try one last flight . " Seven or eight men &; women passengers ( no one was positive of the exact number afterward ) piled into the Sikorsky amphibian and off they went . Twenty minutes later the ship glided to a landing . Crack ! A slapping wave broke the starboard pontoon . Rather than taxi through the swells with his right wingtip boring the water , Pilot Vickery gunned his engines , took off for the landing field near Glenview north of the city . A mile short of that goal the weakened right wing crumpled . The plane crashed in a plowed field . Pilots , passengers , all were cremated.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
