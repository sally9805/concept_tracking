First U. S. wage earner to be registered for a Social Security Act pension at 65 was a 23-year-old Princeton graduate who remarked : " It 's a long way off " ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) . Last week the first U. S. wage earner to apply for a pension was one Ernest Ackerman , for 33 years a motorman for Cleveland Railway Co. , who became 65 on Jan. 2 . His wages for Jan. 1 , day the pension plan went into effect , were $4.96 , of which he paid 5 as the Social Security tax . For his pension , he claimed 32% of his total wages since the plan went into effect . This figures out as 17 , or a profit of 12 . Asking for it in a " lump sum , " Motorman Ackerman announced : " I 'll blow it on my friends . "
