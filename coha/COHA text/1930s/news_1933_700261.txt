txt In Washington Hard Knocks Will Mark Monetary Battle . By ARTHUR BROCK . WASHINGTON , Nov. ** it is evident that the public battle over the administration 's monetary policy , precipitated by Professor 0 . M. W. Sprague 's letter of resignation , will be full of personalities and hard knocks . Comment offered in Washington today and Secretary Woodin 's criticism of Mr. Sprague in New York definitely revealed this tone . What effect the struggle will have on the policy itself its foes frankly have no idea . They were entirely prepared for the Warm Springs dispatches reflecting the President 's determination to proceed along his course in the world gold market . They were not at all surprised at the manner or matter of Mr. Woodin 's statement , although they feel that loyalty was its principal animating force . Mr. Woodin was expected to issue some sort of reassuring statement about government policy before he left on his quest for health . In fact , he indicated strongly that such a statement would be forthcoming . For some reason it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprague 's letter . Sprague Weighed Loyalty Issue . Mr. Woodin , whatever his doubts about the gold purchase and sale plan , is committed to the view that every citizen should now sink his individual opinions on economics and " stand by the President . " That is his creed , and that is now one of the major beliefs of the administration itself . " The President has the country 's interest at heart . The President intends to restore , not to destroy , the country . The President has the ability and intelligence to know how to accomplish that restoration. , And , above everything , he will preserve the credit of the United States . " That is the sort of statement one hears these days from men like Mr. Woodin , who , as President , would probably never have experimented with Professor Warren 's monetary scheme . Friends of-Mr . Sprague say that he weighed arguments of this sort very carefully before he decided on his course . He , with other dissenters , was informed of the President 's belief that public criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of a blow at government credit . But , believing firmly that the gold policy will lead inevitably to greenback inflation and that such inflation will depress the government 's credit perforce , he preferred to take the criticism and make the attack now . " If you are going to break through the ice anyhow , " his friends quote him as saying , " It is better to fall in while you are still near the shore . " So he is all for testing the ice at once , and , if the government credit falls in , to have a. stout group of rescuers ready for life-saving . Policy Suspension a Way Out . There is little hope on the part of those who are responding to Mr. Sprague 's rallying-call that the gold policy will be officially withdrawn before the time comes for what they consider " the inevitable drift toward inflation . " They believe that the bulk of public opinion is against that drift , but they realize that the time is short for education . Yet they are not wholly despairing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing to him an aroused public opinion . If they can do this , they entertain the faint glimmer of a hope that the gold policy might be cast aside without an official admission that this had been done . One way of doing this without conceding it would be for the administration to announce that the gold policy had accomplished what was required of it and now could " temporarily be suspended . " Charts of commodity prices and gold prices could be produced to support the thesis , but statistics must be found to support the charts . At present the gold-price curve is well above the commodity curve , and they must be near to a merger before the President can sustain the statement that his monetary policy has been a success . Even if that merger has been sufficiently effected by statistics , the probability is that suspension of the gold plan would knock down the cotton , grain and stock markets . And to keep up the first two of these is one of the administration 's chief concerns . Shocked by Radio Speech . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is likely that the administration has gone too far on the road to inflation to stop , even if it wants to . It is also likely that the time before decision is too short for Mr. Sprague and his supporters to mobilize for the purpose of turning back the administration by the force of public opinion . Those who have talked recently with the new anti-inflation leader say that there was one aspect of the President 's radio speech in which he announced the gold plan , that shocked Mr. Sprague far more than the fact of the plan 's adoption . He had for some days prior to the speech been advising Secretary Woodin and other Treasury heads on the refinancing operations involving the calling of Liberty bonds by Oct. 15 . He had agreed to the plan whereby holders of Fourth Liberty 414s were urged to exchange them for a new Treasury issue of ten to twelve year bonds , paying 41A the first year and 3 ' , 4 per cent thereafter . The issue drew cash subscriptions of $1,989,015,000 and Fourth Liberty exchange offers flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the administration was guilty of a positive wrong in arranging for this type of refinancing and , a few days later , embarking on the gold policy that depressed the face value of its new issue . After that he and the President were not likely to get along .
