From the menus of some railroad dining cars and many a restaurant , beef several months ago made a silent but definite exit . From the tables of the poor , pork ( " the poor man 's food " ) has likewise long been absent . Reason for both these facts is , as every housewife knows , the current high price of meat . Last week choice steers were selling for $19.50 a cwt. in Chicago , highest price in 18 years , and angry housewives had to pay 47 ; a Ib. for sirloin which they could buy two years ago for 36 and which cost but 52 in the boom year of 1929 . <P> Present high prices are due to the unforeseen occurrence of heavy droughts in 1934 and 1936 , just after the New Deal 's Agricultural Adjustment Administration had slaughtered huge numbers of swine and cattle . Last week it became evident that others beside the consumer have felt this acute livestock shortage when Cudahy Packing Co. , fourth largest in the U. S .. passed a dividend for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Big Four " ( Swift , Armour , Wilson ) , Cudahy suffered more because most of its slaughtering houses were in the drought area and it lacks its bigger rivals ' range of by-products to tide it over . In the last fiscal year ending October 1936 , Cudahy made $1,815,000 or $2.65 per common share . So far this year it has paid $1.87 per common share . In passing last week 's dividend , President Edward A. Cudahy Jr . explained : " Smaller volume of raw material , together with substantial increases in wages , various additional forms of taxes and increased costs of certain supplies , contributed to higher unit operating costs and made it increasingly difficult to earn satisfactory profits . " Cudahy common last week dropped 15 points to $19.50 a share , low for the year .
