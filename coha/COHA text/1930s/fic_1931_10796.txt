The British do n't like it , but that 's because they are n't as good at it as we are . " Her needles clicked rapidly . " Were you figuring on leaving her that dirty green color ?

I had , but there seemed to be no reason to say so to my mother ; and I had decided , finally , that the very dirtiness of the green was an advantage , since it might make us less easily visible to enemy craft . Once or twice , too , I had been tempted to speak to her of the miniature I had found in the pocket of my coat ; but I knew nothing would be gained by idle chatter on the subject , so I remained silent about that as well . She moved restlessly in her chair and sighed . " Get your charts , " she said , not looking up from her knitting . " I 've been thinking about the British trade routes . It 's easiest to go to the Grand Banks and so intercept the merchantmen bound to Halifax from Britain and the Indies ; but I 'm beginning to suspicion it would be a mistake .

" If I were captain of the Lively Lady , I 'd head out across the Gulf Stream and bear south to the sugar trade route . " She tapped her finger on the point that coffee and sugar traders from the West Indies must cross in sailing to England : the same point where there are always slow-moving merchantmenladen with English goods , heading for the West IndianP101markets . " It 'll be hot down there , " she said , " but you ca n't let a little heat stop you . What 's more , I think you 'll find next to no enemy war craft and few enough of our own privateers to compete with you .

I stared at a picture of Rome on the wall paper , a picture showing a sheep herder putting his arm around a handsome , dressy girl , though from what I had seen of sheep herders in Spain and Portugal they 'd be given a wide berth by any girl not weak in the head . My mother finished the stocking . " There , " she said , " that 's the fastest knitting ever done in this town ! If you 're going out on the flood tide you 'd better get forty winks . " We stood in the door , listening to the soft , slow , irregular plunge and murmur of the surf on the hard beach , and to the chirping of the crickets . Then she patted me gently on the shoulder , and we went upstairs . I 've heard it said we New Englanders are cold folk , taking no pleasure in life or love . I do n't know how such beliefs spring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among people said to be more passionate ; and our families could n't conveniently be larger .

We made sail in pursuit ; and since it was our first chase the men were excited and in high spirits , though they made an effort to remain calm , leaning over the bulwarks and spitting when asked a question , and looking always at the sky before answering , though there was no cloud in sight and no chance of a change in wind . As we drew up on this first sail of ours we cleared for action . The muskets , except those for the sharpshooters , were ranged in a rack by the main hatchway ; each man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two long guns were cleared of their screens , the hatchway coamings were set with eighteen-pound shot ; and ready on the decks were boxes of grape and langrage , water buckets , ; tubs of wadding , rammers and sponges , among which Pinky sniffed as though they were there for the sole purpose of letting him locate the rat that had made free with them . She was a slow brig of some three hundred tons . The closer we came , the more Jeddy Tucker licked his lips , pleased and eager at what was about to happen . Just then the brig hove-to and hoisted Russian colors , so I was certain she was a neutral and our first chase a vain one . All around the deck the men settled back on their heels , growling and swearing ; while I , wishing to make no mistake , spoke her and found her to be the Russian brig Moskva , Captain John Blanton , eight days out from Havana bound to St. Petersburg withP1o3a full cargo of sugar , logwood , and coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log book , letters , crew and passengers . All was in order , as I had felt sure would be the case ; and from Blanton , a Louisianian , Jeddy picked up intelligence that did us little good  --  that he had been boarded five days before by His Majesty 's brig Scorpion but had sighted no other sail ; that there were many British vessels at Havana , several ready for sea , and that a convoy was expected to set out within the month . We sent the Moskva on her way and made sail to the southwest . Finding only light airs and calms , such as are often found in this section of the Gulf Stream in the month of September , we got out our lines and trolled , which I do whenever I can in the Gulf Stream because of the innumerable fish that cruise on its surface  --  ferocious fighters and as good eating , or better , than halibut . When the breeze picked up we moved along to the southwestward . Toward evening of the second day we sighted another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disappointment . We were , he said , carrying a Jonah aboard , one that soured our luck ; and from various of his phrases having to do with chair makers and grayfacedwild men , I gathered he had somehow got it in his head that Rowlandson Drown would be at the bottom of any ill success we might have . We laid a course , that night , calculated to hold us in the neighborhood of the sail we pursued ; and when dawn came , the lookout spied it four miles astern . She was a brigantine , a clumsy , slow thing ; and when we ran down toward her and fired a gun , she hove-to and hoisted the American flag . She seemed to have a familiar look ; so when we boarded her I went myself with Jeddy to see what it was that stirred my memory . As our boat came up to her side , I saw a nick in the galley stove pipe . A moment later the lean face of Eli Bagley stared over the rail , as inflamed and congested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halifax harbor . " Well , Captain , " I said , as I came aboard , " this seems like old times . "  | He smiled a sick smile , and I suddenly remembered he was what we call a fish-chowder sailor : one who lacks the courage or the skill to navigate out of sight of the coast . " Are n't you a little far from home ? " " Oh , a leetle ; a leetle . I  --  I got me a sailing master . " " Well , well ! You 're coming up in the world ! You 'll be working a tea ship before you know it ! Let 's look at this sailing master of yours . " Bagley hesitated , his jaw bones moving like the gills of a fish . I could see he wanted to question my authority , but felt he might he treading on delicate ground . " I hold a commission from President Madison , " I told him , " to capture , burn , sink , or destroy all enemy craft . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no enemy craft ! You know me : I 'm out of Portsmouth . " " Where 's that sailing master ? " He hesitated : then pointed to a lean , red-nosed man who stood at the lee rail , looking fixedly at nothing and chewing busily . " What 's your name ? " I asked him . " His name 's Thomas , " Bagley said hurriedly . " Tammas McAndrew , " said the red-nosed man , a hint of sourness in his voice . " A herring choker ! " I said . " I do n't like it . Let 's see your papers . " " There ai n't nothing wrong , " Bagley said . " You know me , Nason . You wo n't find nothing out of the way . " " Let 's see your papers . " We went into his smelly little cabin . The pewter whale-oil lamp , unmended , had been hung back on its hook beside the door . " Well , " I said , when I had finally wormed his papers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a British port with lumber for the British . You 're as good as a Britisher yourself . " Bagley 's lumpy jaw bones moved convulsively . " Why , that ai n't so ! I 'm just a poor man with a living to make ! Why , Halifax harbor 's full of New Englanders running flour to the Canadians ! Gosh almighty ,  |p105Nason  , them poor Canadians could n't live a week if we did n't run flour to ' em ! " " Nor the British army in Canada , " I said . " No , " he agreed uncertainly . He seemed to have no idea he was doing anything out of the way . " Will you tell me how in hell we 're going to whip the British if we keep feeding ' em before we fight ' em ? " " We got to live , ai n't we ? " " I do n't see what 's gained by it . I 'll keep these papers , and you can make for the nearest port in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to Jamaica ! I got to have those papers . " " You 'll never hit Jamaica in a thousand years . I 'm taking your sailingmaster with me , so you 'd better head for more familiar waters . " " You ca n't ! " he shouted , his face a mottled green and crimson , like a half-ripe apple . " I ca n't find my way without McAndrew . " " Yes , you can , " I said . " All you need to do is steer west . You 've got to hit land if you do that . Columbus did it , and so can you , if you know where west is . " " Gosh ! " he said , his eyes round and staring , " what 'll I do if a British frigate chases me ? " " It ought to be worth watching , " I said . " Maybe you can outmaneuverher . " We threw overboard his deckload of lumber . As an afterthought I sent Jeddy to the cabin to hunt for rum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it with Bagley , fearful it might poison my crew if I took it with me . McAndrew made no protest when I ordered him into the boat . " Accept my apologies , " I said , " for taking you off that tidy little craft ; but this is a war , even though some have n't sensed it . " He spat over the side . I saw he was chewing slippery elm . " Tidy ! " he ejaculated . " Did n't he set a good table ? " I asked . " Ghastly ! " McAndrew said. io6 THE LIVELY LADYP106I shook my head at Jeddy . " Life can be very disappointing . Under the circumstances we'Il have to let Mr. McAndrew mess in the gun room  --  at least until we take other prisoners to keep him company . " We were not long in doing that . On the third of November we came up with a brig flying the Spanish flag . We brought her to , for I hoped to buy a few pipes of Spanish wine from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take prizes . She was the Dos Hermanos from Pernambuco to Portsmouth  --  a fine craft , coppered to the bends and clean as the inside of a mussel shell , which is n't usual with Spanish vessels , all those I have seen being thickly crusted with dirt and smelling villainously of rancid oil , garlic and mold . To add to these suspicious circumstances , she had two Englishmen aboard as passengers , one of whom was standing with the captain at the rail as we came up ; and her cargo was composed entirely of India goods : silks , guavas , opium , indigo , tea , ivory , carpets , and spices , chief among these being ginger and turmeric . Now it seemed unreasonable to me that this brig out of Pernambuco should be laden with India goods , rather than with sugar or coffee or aguardiente or cigarros , which are Pernambuco products . The captain was a Spaniard and held the backs of his thumbs against his breast when I sought to question him , flapping his fingers limply in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told Jeddy , " bring down those two Englishmen . " They came down , polite and affable , and we had a glass of Spanish wine together . " You gentlemen took passage from Pernambuco ? " I asked them . They said that was the case . ' Jeddy walked around them and around the captain , looking atthem front and rear . I could see he made the Englishmen uneasy . " You gentlemen have lived in Pernambuco for some time ? " I asked . One of them , a squatty red-faced man , looked helplessly at theother , a small man with the protruding upper front teeth that seemP 107 almost a fashion with so many of the inhabitants of mighty Albion . He said quickly they had been traveling . " For business or for pleasure ? " " Pleasure , " he answered readily enough . The squatty man , I thought , relaxed gently in his chair . " And where have you traveled ? " " Oh , " said the man with the teeth , waving his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India , Ceylon , Madagascar , Brazil --  " Jeddy laughed , his eyes as wide and blue as those of a china doll . The glance of the buck-toothed man shifted and wavered . I poured him another glass of wine , and we drank , all of us . " A pleasant trip , indeed , " I said . " You make it often ? " " No , we 've worked hard for a number of years , and now we feel it 's time we enjoyed ourselves . " " Of course , " I said . " And what may your business have been ? " The squatty red-faced man , I could see , had grown tense once it more . " Really , " said his buck-toothed friend , thoroughly English in his manner but smiling sweetly none the less , " such interest in our affairs is complimentary , I assure you . " " A natural interest , " I told him , " for I recently spent some little11 time among English people and became almost excited about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business ? " " Land , " said the buck-toothed man sourly . " We dealt in land . " " Where ? " " London , of course . Land and houses . " " Your families did n't accompany you ? " " No ; my wife is dead  --  ah  --  my children are too young to travel . " " So you left them with relatives ? " " Here ! " he protested , " you 've no right to ask these things ! " His lips were tight across his teeth ; but when I looked at him without speakingand Jeddy laughed under his breath , he smiled again , albeit atrifle weakly .   " Of course , " he said , " I left them with my sister : two sweet little girls and a little boy . " " And you learned to speak Spanish while selling land in London ? " " Why , yes ; that is , no . I do n't speak Spanish . " " Probably you were talking to the captain in Russian when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glowered at me , and Jeddy laughed again . " Oh , well , " I said , " that does n't matter . Suppose you show me the trinkets you picked up in China and Ceylon and Madagascar for your two sweet little girls . And for the little boy . And for the kind sister who has been caring for this lonely little family . " Both Englishmen stared at me . " Well , " I said at length , " I 'm waiting . Let me see some of the things you bought somewhere except India . " " This is a damned outrage , " the red-faced man said huskily . " No doubt , " I returned , " but if we start exchanging outrages , we 'll be here all night , and we must be on our way . This is an English brig carrying English goods to an English port , and it 's as plain as the nose on my face that the captain 's no captain at all , but a cat'spawput aboard for you to hide behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sloop . " " I protest , " said the man with the buck-teeth , though it was plain he knew he was caught . " What 's to become of the brig ? " " Well , it 's a shame to harm this fine new English vessel , even though she does masquerade under the Spanish flag ; but I 'm going to shift her cargo to the sloop and burn her . " With that I told him to tell the Spanish captain that if all of them would help shift cargo , we would put them aboard a smaller prize some day , so they could sell it and have the money : otherwise they would be ordinary prisonersof war with the chance of being carried to America . We laid the sloop alongside and worked at shifting cargo all that afternoon and through the hot , calm night . An hour after sunup the next day we had what Cephas Cluff and Jeddy and I figured was close to eighty thousand dollars ' worth of the best India goods underP109hatches , to say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spanish wine , and barrels of powder to replace that shot away in practice ; and the crew were sluicing themselves with buckets of clear cool water from the blue Gulf Stream . At eight o'clock we hoisted her sails , lashed her helm , and set her afire . Ten minutes later we ran up to windward and used her as a target . There was an oval keg of Spanish wine at the foot of the musket rack by the main hatch ; and when the crew had given her a few rounds out of long guns double shotted with grape and ball , there were so many white splinters showing around her bends and bulwarks , and so much gear at loose ends , that Jeddy went down and told the crews to have a small tot all around . With that we wore ship under her stem and let her have both long guns through the cabin windows . The grape and solid shot went in with a crash that could be heard above the roar of the guns  --  such a crash as might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainmast was cut four feet above the deck and her foremast halfway up ; so that in less than five minutes she had become a torn and shattered hulk , belching a column of smoke amidships , and trailing masts , sails and shrouds over her sides . ' Lisha Lord turned from this sad wreck to shake his fist threateninglyat the crews . " By Ory ! " he shouted , " I told you to keep that fire low , and here you 've gone halfway up the foremast with your shod What the hell you think you 're shooting at ? Angels ? " P110WE HAD worked well down toward the trade route when Pomp , seated at the masthead like a black cloud , shiny and happy from the heat of the noonday sun , caught the flash of a distant sail on our starboard quarter . We put about , and when we drew up on it in the late afternoon , we made her out to be a ship : a good one ; partly laden so that she rode high out of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two in- the stern . We stared hard at her , but could find no trace of a long gun . " I tell you , " ' Lisha said , " she carries carronades and nothing else , like most running vessels . " The men in the waist of the ship were shouting " Take her ! Take her ! " so we piped to quarters and loaded and double-shotted the long guns . Tommy Bickford brought me the double-barreled fowling piece my mother had traded out of Sir Arthur Ransome , placing it on the deck where it would be handy ; and my little dog Pinky came and lay beside it , helpful and obliging , his whiskers resting on its stock . We ran up the British flag and bore off to windward of her . Her ports were open , and we could see men at the guns , but not many , and I was sure there would not be enough of a crew to damage us with musketry fire when we closed with her . She hoisted no answering flag , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American flag , and fired a gun . She ran on as silently as before , a beautiful , high-sided ship , her mass of sails ruddy in theP111late afternoon sun . A cloud of pink smoke puffed from her stern ; and a spout of water shot into the air two hundred yards ahead of us well off line . " Hell , " ' Lisha told me , " that 's a twenty-four pound carronade ! We can outrange her and take her from here . " " Go ahead , " I said , having determined long ago never to risk losinga man if I could avoid it . ' Lisha sighted his long eighteen . The deck jerked ; the gun roared ; the white smoke came down around us . There was a distant crackle , like a dog crunching a stick between his jaws . The boat at the after davits seemed to fall apart reluctantly . ' Lisha cursed bitterly while the gun crew sponged and rammed , moving with seeming laziness , as they had been taught , but having the gun ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown into our throats . " There , by gravy ! " said ' Lisha , squinting after Pendleton 's shot . " Caught her that time ! " A star-shaped patch of white splinters appeared at the stranger 's water line . ' Lisha pulled his lanyard , and the ship 's mizzenmast swayed drunkenly , just as she turned slowly into the wind . She ran up the British flag , only to haul it down instantly . She was the ship Auchterlonie , Gilbert Lubbock , master , from St. Thomas for Bermuda , 518 tons and twenty-four men , armed with two twenty-four pound carronades and ten nine-pound carronades , and half laden with sugar and rum . I went aboard with Jeddy and found Lubbock feeling unhappy , as well he might . " Here , " I told him , " it 's not your fault . If I did n't take you , somebodyelse would . " " Aye , " he said , gazing bitterly at the Lively Lady , which seemed too small and battered , lying off to windward , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could have stayed with the convoy another day or so . " Here was news indeed  --  news that might , if our luck held , result happily for us and sadly for the British . " That 's true , " I said , hoping112 THE LIVELY LADYp112to lead him into giving me further information , " but doubtless we 'd have caught you in the end ; for it 's probably a small convoy , and weakly guarded , like most we find in these waters . " Lubbock nodded angrily . " Weakly ! " he growled . " The word 's as weak as the guard ! If the Governors of the Bank of England followed the methods of the fools in the Admiralty , they 'd toss their money in the street and set a sleepy midget to guard it ! Thirty-two sail there were in our convoy when I hauled away , and no protection save the Turnstone sloop-of-war . " Delighted at what he told me , I assured him we would do all we could for him . " Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I said , " we 'll try to get you another vessel somewhere . Anyway , America is n't so bad . All our prisoners are paroled . " I dinna like the place , " he growled . " It 's either too hot or too cold , always , and not too bonnie , neither . " As an afterthought he added , " But bonnier than the stone box the British have for prisoners . They 'll give ye no parole ! " " I know , " I said hastily , having heard enough of Dartmoor . " Where 's your specie , Captain ? " He shrugged his shoulders and pressed his lips together stubbornly ; then , evidently figuring on making the best of a bad bargain , he showed me the panel behind which he kept his specie kegs , they being made and marked to look like nail kegs . We rolled out twelve , containing thirty-five hundred English pounds , or in the neighborhoodof eighteen thousand dollars . We took out some rum and small articles from the Auchterlonie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look like patches of Maine sunsets , so beautifully rosy are their feathers . Then , though I disliked the thought of so many prisoners , we sent the captain and the crew to the Lively Lady , wheeled a carronade to the Auchterlonie 's main hatch , and blew a hole in her bottom  --  though I could n't help but hear the men growlingwhile they did it . We had brought Rowlandson Drown with us , in anticipation ofP113needing a carpenter 's help in scuttling her ; and I think his grumbling was loudest . " We 'd get forty thousand dollars for this ship if she was manned out for home , " he told Seth Tarbox , his face dark with sourness ; and unfortunately he was right . It was dark when we set her afire and tumbled into our boat ; and we wasted no time on rum or Spanish wine , for every last one of us panted to see the-convoy of which Lubbock had spoken . We paroled Captain Lubbock , the two Englishmen from the Dos Hermanos , the Spanish captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be watchful of the seamen lest they rise against us and seize the Lively Lady for themselves , which was why I dislikedtaking prisoners if I could avoid it ; yet I could n't turn them loose in a good ship when it was my purpose to distress the enemy in the greatest possible degree . We bore off to the eastward , hunting for the convoy , and cruised for three days , with the weather what it so often is in those parts  --  bright blue overhead , fleecy beds of cloud near the horizon , and occasionally a sharp squall banging past with a thunderstorm in its arms . Toward mid-afternoon on the third day there was a bellowing of " Sail ho ! " from the bow and the masthead at the same time , a distant squall having uncovered a white speck like the tip of a hen feather . Hoping we had found the convoy , we held on our course , and soon discovered the stranger had hauled her wind and was bearing straight for us . Since there was no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . We ran off on the other tack , figuring on getting to windward of her , whereupon she went off on the other tack herself , and we saw she was a schooner with a raking stern and bow and almost no freeboard , so that she seemed plastered to the water . She had tremendously tall raking masts and next to no top-hamper , there being only two shrouds to the foremast and one to the mainmast ; and the masts , bending like fishing rods , seemed to spring the schooner ahead as though she were alive and being whipped along . She had a beautiful clean run , and she slipped over the waves , rather than through them , seeming to have no keel at all to hold her back . " Well , " I said , " there 's only one place where they build schooners like that , and that 's Baltimore . " The others agreed , but we manned the long guns for the sake of safety and watched her whisk through the water . We saw she could weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest schooner I had ever seen . If we were logging twelve knots , which I think we were , she must have been logging thirteen and a half . I even think she was doing a knot or so better than that , but I am reluctant to say it for fear there will be folk to snort and declare no craft afloat can travel with such speed . I knew no Britisher could have overhauled her in a chase , so it seemed to me that she must be an American privateer . If I had not felt sure , I would have run from her long before ; and I think I could have kept ahead of her until dark and then given her the slip . We ran up the American flag , and I maneuvered to get under her lee ; but a hen might as well have maneuvered to get under the lee of a kingfisher . She came about and ran down on us . We could see she carried fourteen guns  --  two of them long guns  --  and had a sizable crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside ; not a half pistol shot away ; and since there were no muskets leveled at us we knew her captain was certain of our nationality . None the less , her gun crews were at their stations , and a dark , slender man with a small black mustache , flashing white teeth , and elegant-seeming clothes clung to the ratlines , one hand on his hip , and shouted down wind , " What sloop is that ? " I rapped Pinky on the snout to stop his barking , he being beside me with his forepaws on the rail , considerably affronted by this stranger 's question . " Private armed sloop Lively Lady , Nason , out of Arundel , " I called back . The dark man took off his gray beaver hat and made me a politeP115bow . " Schooner Comet , " he shouted , " out of Baltimore ; Boyle commanding . Would you do me the honor ? " We hove to , and I was rowed over to the Comet , where Boyle met me , hat in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side . This Captain Thomas Boyle of Baltimore was the most affable man I have ever known , and the gentlest-seeming . Indeed , if I had not seen more of him at a later date , I might have thought his deferenceassumed ; for it seemed to me , at times , that no man could be as gracious as he and still be serious about it . Yet he was always courteous , even to his men and prisoners ; though there are captains of a score of British war craft and masters of almost a thousand Britishmerchantmen who have declared he was the most tantalizing and troublesome man that ever lived . He was , as I have said , gentle  --  so gentle , almost , as to seem harmless  --  andappreciative of things said by others . I noticed early in our acquaintance that if I was speaking with him and he was forced , for some reason , to interrupt the conversation , he would apologize profoundly at the earliest opportunity and ask me to be kind enough to proceed from the point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in on me . He was quiet , too : the most deceptive man , it seems to me , that ever lived . His seamanship was a thing for seamen to marvel at , and I have never seen his equal for boldness . It was this boldness that so addled and fuddled the British ; and it was common talk in French ports at one time that the captain of a British frigate had been so infuriated at Captain Boyle 's behavior in the Channel that he had wept openly on his own quarter-deck from rage . He took me below to a neat small cabin as pleasant to look at as his beautifully fitting broadcloth coat and pale-colored trousers buckled under his boots , and had out a mahogany chest inlaid with a satinwood lion and unicorn . " I do hope you 'll like this , Captain , " he said , drawing out a fivesidedbottle made from purple glass  --  the prettiest bottle I had evern6 THE LIVELY LADYp116seen . " It seems to me not half bad . I took it from a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had . This is from the oldest , and I find it passable , but I 'm eager to have your opinion . , He took a goblet from the slots in the cover  --  a purple goblet , like the bottle  --  filled it for me , and watched me anxiously while I sipped . If the wine had been sea water and sour milk I would have praised it , because of his eager hospitality , but it seemed to be a blend of delicious fruits and faint perfumes and the essences of tropical nuts . " Well , " he said , when I spoke enthusiastically of it , " that is very kind of you . Very kind . Let us have another glass . Then you must tell me about your cruise . I hope and trust , Captain , that your cruise has been successful . Your idea of a small boat is excellent  --  excellent ! Next year you may find a larger craft advisable ; but what we need now is speed . I think you 're exactly right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " No , your sloop is very fast , Captain Nason . You 're too modest by far . You could have lost me in the dark if you 'd tried . " " Yes , and if I 'd tried , I might have been raked with a long twentyfouraround midnight . " Captain Boyle laughed , a musical Southern laugh , quite in keepingwith his voice , which , being soft and flat , was easy on the ear . " No , sir ; I always talk things over with an enemy before I shoot , if it 's possible . " " Well , " I said , " I saw she was a Baltimore schooner , so I suspicionedyou were American , but I never saw a Baltimore schooner behave like this . Sometimes she gets right up out of the water and flies . " " It 's a pleasure to hear such appreciation from a seaman like yourself , Captain Nason , " Captain Boyle assured me . He held up his purple goblet and stared through it at the scuttle overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to tell you that so far as I know the Comet is the fastest Baltimore clipper ever built . She 's faster thanP117little Baltimore-built government sloop Enterprise . Doubtless you ember her , Captain Nason .

I 'm very averse to saying it , sir ; for I might be misunder- ) d ; but you 've seen the Comet , sir , from the deck of a fast sloop ; I 'll tell you she 's logged over fifteen knots . " I could make no reply to this except to whistle , which I did ; and had a drink on it . " Well , " I said , " I 've had fair luck , but I hope to have better . There 's convoy of thirty-two sail bound for England under the sloop-of-war Turnstone . " " A convoy ! " Boyle exclaimed , and his eyes , velvety brown eyes seemed to glow with yellow lights . " A convoy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped our Madeira silently . I knew he was thinking long-:1y , as was I , of that diversity of vessels with the sloop-of-warssing around them like a hen with a family of addle-pated chicks . Finally Boyle shook his head . " I should be off about my business . ve taken nine prizes on this cruise and manned out six for American ports . My crew 's reduced to forty-two men instead of the hundred and twenty with which I started ; and I 've a swarm of prisoners  --  board , eating me out of house and home . " I asked him whether many privateers were putting to sea . " Lord ! " he said , chuckling a rich Southern chuckle , " the sea 's full of ' em ! " He threw himself back in his chair , hung a fawn-colored leg over its arm , looked up at the scuttle , and checked them off on his fingers . " Out of Baltimore alone there 's Barney in the Rossie with a hundred and twenty men and fourteen guns , Grant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revenge with sixteenguns and a hundred and forty men , Dooley in the Rolla , Wilson iu the Tom . That 's six . There 's the Dolphin , the Nonsuch , the Globe , the Wasp , the Hornet , the Liberty : twelve . There 's the Sparrow , thirteen , and the Sarah Ann , fourteen , all out of Baltimore . There must be three thousand Baltimore men at sea in privateers andP118letters-of-marque : all fast vessels , sir ; fast and well armed ; commanded by able men . Speaking of able men , Dominique Diron 's out of Charleston in the Decatur . He 's a Frenchman and a pirate , but he 's able ! There 's some out of New York that you 'll hear from , too : fast and dangerous  --  the Governor Tompkins , and the General Armstrong  --  byjolly , Captain Nason , there 's a brig , the General Armstrong , with nineteen guns and a hundred and forty men , that would make trouble for any British sloop-of-war ! There 's the Yorktown and the Holkar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there 's the Saratoga and the Orders in Council and the Benjamin Franklin  --  and over a dozen more I 'll call to mind in a minute . Why , they 're coming out of the Chesapeake like a swarm of bees and pouringout of New York ; and I 've heard , Captain Nason , that New England'snot being backward in the matter . " " They must be coming out of Salem and Boston almost as fast , " I told him , " and they 'll be out of Portsmouth and Newburyport in fair numbers , if they have n't started already . " He nodded . " If I knew how to do it , I 'd bet a thousand dollars to a pipe of old Madeira that American privateers will capture or destroy five hundred British merchantmen in a year 's time , and do more than a hundred million dollars ' worth of damage . " " Do n't you ever bet ? " I asked him . " Whenever I get the chance , " Captain Boyle replied politely , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " " This convoy , now , " I reminded him : " It would be an education to watch you in chase of it . " " That 's very kind of you , sir : very kind , " Captain Boyle said . " Not only kind , but gracefully expressed . " He meditatively touched his small black mustache with his finger tips . " I should be getting home with my prisoners and refitting for another cruise . " He stared at me thoughtfully . " But it would be mighty pleasant , " he added , " to keep company with you against that flight of doves . " " I must get rid of my prisoners , too , " I reminded him , " and I 'll refitp119from one of the convoy if my luck holds . " At this both of us rapped the table top with our knuckles . He sighed gently . " I do n't like to sail short-handed . It 's an uncomfortablefeeling if you have a sudden need to fight . Still , we may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It has been known to happen  --  " he smiled at me gaily  --  " so I 'll go along with you a little way , though we ca n't expect to do much unless we get a bit of dirty weather . " I knew that here was a rare piece of good fortune , running into a seaman like Boyle and finding him willing to keep company with me against a convoy ; for while it 's not overdifficult to harry a convoy alone , provided you have luck , it 's easier and surer when two together make the attack . None the less , I did n't begin to know how fortunate I was ; for all I knew of Boyle was that he was a good seaman . We arranged that the first to sight the convoy should run down to the other so that plans might be made , and that if the convoy should be sighted by one while we were separated , the discoverer should hang astern of it for three days before attacking , in the hope that the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest , being already on the trade route ; and le was almost discouraged at the manner in which the Comet outsailed us , even though we cracked on all we had . Yet we hung together by dint of Boyle making long reaches to windward and to leeward , and so worked up in the general direction of the Azores . The bright blue sky that had favored us so long was filmed with a loose gray veil on the second or third day , and the wind had started to pick the tops from the waves , shake them to pieces and toss them against our mainsail , when Pomp , riding high and darksome at the masthead , shouted that the Comet had put about . We made her out shortly , bearing down on us like a distant gull ; and ten minutes later , when she had taken on size , Pomp went to shouting , " Sail ho ! Sail ho ! Sail ho ! " until I thought he had lost his mind . But the men in the bow moved excitedly and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convoy . With that I put the sloop into the wind , hoping we had escaped their notice ; and in the southwest I saw , faint and far off , a small gray dot that came and went , and then another , and then two more close together . I did n't bother to hunt for others , for they could n't be far away , I knew , and it was a pleasant thought that within our reach were more than thirty West Indiamen laden with millions of dollars ' worth of rum and sugar and India goods , and God knows how many kegs of specie . The Comet came slipping up under our lee as easy and graceful as a seal , and Boyle waved his gray beaver to me , affable and polite and anxious to please . The men crowded up to look at him when he came aboard ; and I could tell from this how they felt toward him ; for our Maine men wo n't stir two feet to see a person like the Dey of Algiers , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced around at them and smiled a bashful smile , very friendly . " Well , Captain , " he said , bowing a quick little bow to me , but speaking , I was sure , for the benefit of the crew , " it looks as though England might find herself somewhat poorer by dawn to-morrow . " P121WHEN we had made our plans , we payed off to the southward till dusk ; then turned to the northeast in the track of the convoy . It was a night of pale darkness with a smart wind from the east ; yet it was not bad , for the stars shone , and the sea was nothing to cause us inconvenience , though the decks were wet with scud , and there was a moaning in our top-hamper that foretold heavier weather . The Comet stood along within half pistol shot of us under a reefed mainsail and jib , so we might hang together . We could make her out clearly , skimming along as easily as the deep-sea birds that follow craft for days in mid-ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as silent as though she sailed without a crew , with no figure showing on her decks except that of the helmsman . Not a sound could I hear from her above the complaining of our mast , the screakingof the boom and the gun carriages , and the gushing rush of the waves along our sides . Yet I knew her people were on deck , as were our own , armed with cutlasses and boarding axes , the sharpshooters ready with their muskets , and all of them lying under the bulwarks or sprawled around the long guns . When we had held our course for two hours , there was a hoarse half shout of " Sail ho ! " from the bow . In the same instant I heard the same half-stifled call from the deck of the Comet , and as if she had been nothing more substantial than a fog she sheered away and was gone in the gloom . I saw the bulk of a smallish vessel on our lee bow . We came up on122 THE LIVELY LADYp122her fast . I caught sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a small brig . We hauled a little away ; then ranged alongside . There was a shout from the man at the helm of the brig . With that Jeddy clapped his hands , and our boarders came out from under the bulwarks and went over the brig 's side and into her waist , fast and silently . There were four men on the brig 's deck , unarmed and with no thought of attack , so when Jeddy led a boarding party of ten toward the stern and Rowlandson led another ten toward the bow , all with cutlasses swinging , there was no opposition and no noise save another shout or two and a little thudding of feet on the deck . In five minutes Rowlandson 's ten boarders were back again . The brig came about , according to plan , and the two of us bore off to the southwest , all without a shot being fired or a flare kindled to give the alarm . For fifteen minutes we drove back on this course , keeping the brig close under our lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy , we hove to once more and settled the business . The brig proved to be the Star of the Indies , Fagin , master , two six-pounders and a crew of nine , from Jamaica for Liverpool , laden with rum , sugar , and fresh fruits . Also she had two thousand dollars in specie , which we promptly seized . Having no time to waste , I proposed to the captain that if he would put his men to work transferringa part of his fresh fruit to the Lively Lady , receive on board our prisoners , and engage to sail northwest for two days , so that he would be in no likelihood of picking up the convoy again , I would transfer one third of the brig to him and one third to Captain Lubbock , who had told me of the convoy , and one third to the remainder of the prisoners and his crew and set them all free . Otherwise , I told him , I would take him and his men prisoners and scuttle his brig to boot . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would jump down my throat in his eagerness to accept ; and two hours laterP123we were once more on our way to the northeast , free of prisoners and keeping a sharp lookout for the Comet . A little after half-past ten we made out a sail on our weather beam and were sure we had again come up with the convoy . When we found this craft to be another small brig , we fell away from her , wishing bigger game . We were soon rewarded by sighting a large ship , and without more ado ran under her lee and ordered her to wear immediately and head southeast , or we 'd sink her . This was the plan made between Captain Boyle and myself  --  that I should run my second prize off to the southeast while he ran off to the northwest . Thus if one of us should be pursued by the convoying sloop , the other would have time to strip his prize . Instead of obeying our order , the ship held on her way , firing a gun . We heard no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warn the others . At this ' Lisha Lord rapped out a quick order to the musket men , as we had agreed . A crackling of small arms sent pale flashes against her sails and the smoke wisps that still clung to them . There was a crying-out on her deck , indicating that Moody IIaley and Moses Burnham had poured their fire into the helmsman . " Wear ship ! " I shouted again , " or I 'll blow you to pieces . " She came about slowly . Ahead of her a blue flare blazed in a ship 's bows , revealing faintly luminous mainsails , topsails , and topgallant sails against a wavering background of blue light . Two miles to leewardanother blue flare shone out ; and then a third , almost a mile away . There was no way of telling whether they had been set off out of fright at hearing the gun , or whether Boyle had swooped down on another of the convoy and so put all of them into the tremors . Now a strange thing happened when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hove her to ; for when I boarded her I found a person I had known before ; and though I had no thought of meeting an acquaintance , I felt no surprise at the encounter any more than as though I had expected it . The ship was the Lord Startham , James Houie , master , from Kingston to Falmouth , 407 tons , 10 guns and eighteen men  --  or what had been eighteen men ; for our musketry fire had killed the helmsmanand wounded the first mate . She was laden with sugar , rum and indigo , and carried 8,250 English pounds in specie . Not liking the groans of the first mate , poor man , who had been shot through the lungs , I sent back the boat to bring aboard our doctor , Jotham Carr , ordered the indigo to be swayed up from the hold for transfer to the Lively Lady , and rapidly proceeded to an examination of the ship 's papers , knowing the sloop-of-war might come down on us at any moment . I discovered there were three passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sugar plantation in Jamaica , and the others his wife and her maid . I had no liking for this ; for there was no place on our sloop for women , nor had I any desire to encumber myself with prisoners . " Have these people brought here , " I said to the captain , for whom I had little sympathy because he had kept on his course when I hailed him . " I think they should have something to say concerning their disposition . " Sanderson proved to be a young man with a pleasant dignity about him and a look that struck me as vaguely familiar . With him came his wife , a pretty blonde girl of a washed-out appearance , as though she had stood too long in tropical rainstorms , and behind her a maid whom I could see but dimly in the light of the whale-oil lamp , , which swung in figure eights with the uneasy rolling of the ship . " I 'm sorry for all this , " I said to them , wondering where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take , burn , sink , or destroy all enemy craft , and this ship must be sunk . Now , I can do either of two things , and because of Mrs. Sanderson I 'll let you say which it shall be . Either I can take all of you as prisoners to my sloop , which is small and uncomfortable , and destroy this ship ; or I can stand by you till morning , run you within sight of the convoy , and set you afire . Then the sloop-of-war will take you off , or you can go in your boats to one of the other vessels . There 's some danger inP125the first course , for nobody can tell when we 'll be fired on ourselves . As for the second course , if you go aboard a merchantman , she may quickly be captured herself , so you 'll have it all to do over again . " When I said this my eye caught a movement of the maid behind Mrs. Sanderson . I stared hard at her and saw she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little from its grimness , as though she wished to smile but could n't quite decide on it . I knew then I had seen this grim gray woman in a field near Saco . Her name , I remembered , was Annie ; she had given Jeddy and me a glass of wine at the behest of Lady Emily Ransome . It seemed a queer thing , the thought that flashed through my head when I recognized her ; for it was the thought that this was quite right and proper : that the whole affair had happened this way before , which of course it had n't . Having glanced at me , she looked quickly down at the cabin floor again . It occurred to me it might be well to wait before seeming to recognize her , lest the Sandersons annoy us with questions and k make it more difficult for me to do what I had to do . Also she put other thoughts in my head : thoughts of Lady Ransome 's hoitytoityness : of how she had looked with my knife clasped tight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree : of my miniature of her , which , as it happened , I had in my breast pocket even now . It happened , too , that I had a thought to speak to Annie alone . Before the Sandersons could answer my question , young Jotham Carr came in at the cabin door . " Captain , " he said , " the mate 's dead . " " Well , " I said , looking at Houie , " I 'm sorry to hear it . It would never have happened if you had n't been so injudicious as to run from an armed vessel at night . " " Captain , " said Sanderson , " we 'd be obliged to you if you 'd let us remain on board this ship to-night . I 'd prefer not to trust my wife to a small boat in a choppy sea . " " Very good , " I told him ; " and how 'll you feel if it comes on to blow a gale and you have to get off in it to-morrow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix my mind on the colting I had received aboard the Gorgon , for I had no more love for the business than Sanderson had . " My wife has been ill , " Sanderson said . " I 'm taking her home in the hope she 'll recover . " There it was : what I had dreaded . If I have learned anything about war in the little I have seen of it , it 's that you must n't think of the enemy as human beings , like yourself , but as some sort of devouringmonsters capable of doing any wicked deed : that you must think of everyone as nothing more than worthless playing cards or chessmen , to be tossed away or crushed or destroyed so long as advantages are gained and battles won ; otherwise there seems to be nothing worth fighting about . Yet in spite of knowing all this I had let Sandersonmention his wife 's illness ; and on top of everything I had been such a fool as to listen to him . " Well , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without seeming to ask , " your wife will probably be all right , with the sea voyage and all . She 's fortunate to have a woman to look out for her . I should think it would be hard to get such a woman in the Indies . " " Oh , we 'd never have got her in the Indies , " he said . " I wrote to my sister in England , and she sent her out to me . " " Oh , did she ! " I said weakly , for his mention of his sister in England , coupled with Annie 's presence , had made it plain to meat last why I had found a familiar look about him . It was because his sister had married Sir Arthur Ransome . I strove to decide what should be done , and the more I strove , the more I regretted my misfortune in encountering such people as Sanderson and his blue-eyed ailing wife . For a moment I considered sending for Jeddy , knowing he held himself merciless where Britisherswere concerned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle myself . " Well , " I said at length , watching Sanderson carefully to see whether he might not give me reason to be harsh with him , " I 've heard that turn about is fair play , and if this is so , I must remindP127myself that a few weeks before this war broke out I was taken from my brig by a press gang from the crew of the Gorgon sloop-of-war and whipped for nothing except to gratify the spleen of her captain , and be damned to him . " Sanderson twisted up the corner of his mouth and looked at me out of eyes the color of smoke , so that I stared at him in a sort-of confusion because of the memories of Lady Ransome that crowded my brain . " All Englishmen are n't like that , " he said . " Probably not , " I admitted , " but since England filled her ships for this war out of jails and poorhouses , the Englishmen that Americans see are worse than anything we 've ever been able to imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a great pity . " " Oh , " I said , " there 's no use going over and over all this ! If you and the captain will give me your word to keep away from the convoy and make no further effort to join it , I 'll turn you loose with your cargo . But I wish a paper signed  --  a paper saying it 's done because of Mrs. Sanderson , and for no other reason , and stipulating that half the sale price of the cargo belongs to her . " " Sir --  " said Sanderson in a choked voice ; but I had no time to listen to further talk . " Is that agreed , yes or no ? " I asked . Since there was nothing else for the captain to do , he agreed . " Very well , " I said gruffly to him in response . " You 'll step into Mr. and Mrs. Sanderson 's cabin and draw up the paper instantly . " As he seemed to demur and cavil , " Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of you ! " They obeyed me , and I turned to Annie , who seemed about to follow . I frowned , to cover an unreasonable embarrassment . " You 'll remain here , " I said , and I fear I looked foolish . " You 're not needed in the drawing up of such a paper , I take it . " " No , sir , " she returned meekly , leaning against the table and swaying with the slow rocking of the ship . " You have something you wish to say to me , sir ? " I stared at her sternly . " No , I haven't. " 128 THE LIVELY LADY " You did n't wish to ask -- - " " Well , " I said negligently , " I seem to recall having seen you . I seem to have seen you in attendance on Sir Arthur Ransome at --  " " No , Captain , " she said quietly , " upon Lady Ransome . " " It may be ; it may be , " I returned . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They reached home safely ? " " Quite safely , " she said . " They went straight to Ransome Hall , near Exeter . " " " Exeter ? " I asked . " Oh , yes : they went to Exeter . But this ship is outward bound from Jamaica . She  --  they left home again , possibly . " " It was I , " she said , looking down at her feet . " I was not to stay there long myself . We were home in May , and in June Lady Ransomesent me to her brother 's wife in Jamaica . " " Oh , " I said , " to her brother 's wife ! Indeed ! " She glanced toward the door of the Sandersons ' cabin , which was just off that of the master , in which we stood . " Yes , Captain . " I stroked my chin . " You 've been long in Lady Ransome 's service ? " " Since she was twelve years old , Captain . " Suddenly she gave a hiccup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressing . " I ca n't see how she could let you go so far away , if she thought so highly of you , " I said . " It was over something that was lost . " " You mean something belonging to Lady Ransome ? " I asked . " Something she thought you 'd stolen ? " i " Oh , no , sir ! It was S'Roth ! This thing was lost , and I was the last one to see it ; and S'Roth was angry and kept saying I should take better care of m'lady'sthings . " It seemed as though I might burst in this small cabin , what with the heat and all . " Did he nag at her ? " I asked . " Did he nag at his  --  at Lady Ransome ? " " Oh , sir , " she cried , " he 's a devil ! He 's forever peering and prying ! He kept at m'lady and kept at her about it , and kept at her top129get rid of me and get somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he said I 'd have to go . " I could see Sir Arthur 's thin , pale face before me and hear his whining voice chewing at his words and pushing them up against his teeth . I stood and simmered for a while , rolling Annie 's revelations through my head . Talk , I knee , would remedy nothing ; my best procedure was to let well enough alone and hold my tongue . Yet I could not bring myself to drop the subject , not until I had asked Annie one more question ; so I coughed and cleared my throat , and finally said to her : " What was it she lost ? Was it  --  was it a piece of  --  was it a piece of jewelry ? " At this Annie nodded violently and burst into a storm of tears , so that it would have been difficult for me to question her further , even though I had wished to . Somewhat uncertainly , I fear , I watched her and thought of many things to say but did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , it 's too late to mend matters now , " and I added , not quite knowing what I meant myself : " A present 's a present and could n't be returned without insult , so stop your sniveling ! " Upon this , much befuddled in my mind , I strode out to the main deck and gave a great many orders in an angry voice . Among them was one to Jeddy , which he heartily misliked  --  to take fifty gold sovereigns from the specie kegs and carry them to Annie . Seeing he was averse to the task , and being a little clearer in my mind , I took the sovereigns myself and went below . Truth to tell , I could not leave the ship until I had seen Annie once more . She was sitting in the cabin where I had left her , staring down at her folded hands . " Now , here , " I said , dropping the sovereigns in her lap , " I do n't understand this . I ca n't wait around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , sir , " Annie replied . " Well , then , " I said , " well , then  --  ah  --  you say there was  --  that is toP130say , you could see that this man  --  this gentleman we were speaking of  --  you could see he was n't always  --  ah  --  pleasant ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , " I said , impatient at her slowness , " speak up ! Do n't beat about the bush ! " " Oh , sir ! " Annie said , " it was a great mistake , and such a pretty little thing , always gay and happy ; and now sour looks if she so much as laughs at anything ! She 'll be old and bitter while she 's still a baby . " " Old and bitter ! " I repeated , recalling how Lady Ransome had bound up my head in Arundel , and how I had felt her soft arm against my cheek . " I wo n't  --  a man ca n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked up at the whale-oil lamp , jerking at its chains with the wallowing of the ship . I thought it burned dimly . The reek of it seemed to irritate my eyes and throat . " You can always get  --  I mean , could n't anybody help  --  could n't you help her ? Could n't you do anything ? " I may have shaken the cabin table overstrongly , for I heard the mahogany crack . She looked away from me thoughtfully . " I ? " she asked . " I ? What could I do ? Now , you --  " " I ? " I asked . " What could I do ? " " I think , " she said , moving uncomfortably , " I think she 'd like to see you again . " " See me ? " I demanded . " Why should she want to see me ? How could she see me when my country 's at war with England ? " " And will you be fighting forever ? " she asked . I thought the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingout of it except that it would be well if I did what I could to see that this war of ours was as short as I could help to make it . It must have been one o'clock in the morning when we finished loading the indigo and specie aboard the sloop and hauled away from the Lord Starham . Toward morning the east wind that hadP131threatened us the night before died completely , and we lay and wallowed on a turbulent gray-blue sea . On the following day the breeze came up again from the west , and we moved along in search of the convoy , without finding it . During the night , however , we heard the sound of guns and guessed that the Comet was at them again . Early the next morning we found them , twenty-seven sail , huddled together so close that from where we watched them they looked as though a skysail could have been thrown over the lot , barringone , which hung in their rear , so that I knew it was the Comet . While we watched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single sail , all very small and distant to the eye ; and we heard guns , though we were too far off to see the smoke , even . It seemed plain to me that the Comet was harrying the convoy for the deviltry of it , and that the Turnstone was seeking to chase her away or get within striking distance of her . If Boyle wished to play that game , I thought , I could do nothing but help him ; and with that I crowded on all sail and moved off to the westward ; then bore north ; and in two hours ' time we had run well ahead of the convoy and were bearing down on its weather bow . The Turnstone was still playing at long balls with Boyle , and I hoped to reach one of the convoy before she could return ; but it was impossible ; for when the convoy sighted us they ran together like frightened quail and fired guns , whereupon the cruiser put about instantly and returned to them . We lay off , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head to let drive at us with her long guns ; and while we lay there , studying the convoy and picking out the craft that looked most likely as prizes , Boyle did a thing I was glad to have seen , so that if ever I could have a fast enough craft , I might some day find myself in a position to profit by the lesson . He bore off to windward of the convoy , which was closely bunched , with the sloop-of-war herding them along in the rear , and then came running along toward us , as pretty a sight as ever was . The masts of his graceful craft seemed to bend and give like willow branches and to thrust her along by their bending , as a strip of whalebone , pressed against a slender board , might spring it through the water . The Comet came close up under our lee ; and Boyle , affableand dapper , clung to a stay and waved his hat . " You 'll dine with me , Captain ? " he shouted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll be back in half an hour . " We payed off and watched him . He stood past the convoy ; then tacked suddenly and shot across its bow . With that the Turnstone moved out from behind the merchantmen and set off after Boyle . But Boyle , having rounded the head of the convoy , hauled his wind in a flash and slipped down the opposite side , having put the entire fleet between himself and the sloop-of-war ; and to us it seemed , and was indeed the fact , that the Turnstone 's movements , by comparison with those of the Comet , were like those of a clumsy , flustered crow attempting to escape the agile dartings of a kingbird . While our crew , and our officers as well , for that matter , stamped their feet at the bulwarks , shouting with laughter and waving their caps at this display of speed and agility , the Comet rounded to and shot alongside a fine large ship . What happened then we could not see , except that the Turnstone labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had rounded them we saw well what it was that had occurred ; for the Comet 's head payed off again , and she flew on her way down the convoy 's lee side , while from the deck of the ship at which she had stopped there rose a pale wavering haze of smoke -- a haze that grew thicker as we watched ; then suddenlybillowed out and puffed upward , enveloping the mainsail , topsail , and topgallant sail in a pillar of smoke and flame . We could see the Turnstone come up with the burning vessel and heave to , so the crew might be picked up , and all the while the Comet foamed along behind us , as swift and innocent-looking as a teal duck skimmingthe surface of a marsh . She drew abreast , so close we could see the rings in the gun tampions and the gold key dangling at the end of Captain Boyle'sP133watch fob as he stood by the wheel , beaming at us and feeling tenderly of his small mustaches . He lifted his hat debonairly as our crew manned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments later he said apologetically , " I hope I have n't made you hungry , Captain ! I 'm some minutes late ; but dinner 's waiting in my cabin . " P134IT WAS on the fifteenth of December that the Lively Lady came through the teeth of a blow into the Bay of Biscay , got under the lee of the land , and made the mouth of the Loire ; and I know of nothing that had ever looked more welcome to me  --  barring our own oblong patch of farmland in Arundel  --  than the calm surface of the river , the bright green islands in it , and the small stone houses on the low-lying banks . We had clung to the lee of the convoy until a gale of wind blew up from the northwest , whereupon that had happened which always happens with a convoy : it had been scattered by the blow , some heaving to , some scudding under bare poles , and some setting a few rags of sail and holding their course as best they could . While they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , a ship and two brigs without the firing of a gun ; and it was with the last of them that our trouble started . The brig Loyal Nancy was laden with 146 puncheons of Jamaica rum and some mahogany ; and we took out her crew and burnt her . The brig Hesperides was laden with rum , sugar and coffee , and 2,300 English pounds in specie ; and we took out her crew , used her as a target , and sank her . The ship Rose of the West was laden with 320 hogsheads of sugar and 90 seroons of indigo , the latter having a value of $18,00o . This Rose of the West was a handsome ship of 400 tons ; and after we had taken the indigo from her with great difficulty because of  --  e roughness of the sea , I gave orders to burn her , though I regretted o destruction of so staunch a craft . Before my orders were carried but , Rowlandson Drown , with three of the men , came to me . Rowndson , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked mulish and lowering . " Captain , " Rowlandson said , " there 's been some talk among the en about the destruction of these vessels . It seems to us as how might be possible to make a dollar out of this ship if she was han  --  led different . " " How would you propose to handle her , Rowlandson ? " I asked , . arful that I had overlooked something , and desirous of getting as much prize money as could be got . Jeddy thrust in a contemptuous oar . " He wants to make chairs out of her and raft ' em ashore . " " Go ahead , Rowlandson , " I told him . " Let 's hear what 's on your mind . " " Well , " he said , " it appears to us we must be close to some port or other after all this sailing . We could put a prize crew aboard that ship and run her in . " " No , " I told him , " I wo n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes , and we 're not equipped for it . " " Could n't you spare four men ? " he asked . " No , " I told him , " I 'd have to send a navigator with them . I ca n't mare them , anyway . We 've got barely enough men as it is . " " We could sell that ship for forty thousand dollars ! " " You could if a sloop-of-war did n't take you prisoner , which it probably would , and if you got to port , which you probably would n't . I wo n't do it . " " A dollar 's a dollar ! " Rowlandson grumbled . He stood looking at me , gray-faced and glum , but I shook my head . " It is n't safe , " I told him . ' What I 'm doing is best for all of us . " In spite of his dissatisfaction and that of a good part of the crew , when we slipped into the yellow waters of the Loire we had a cargoaboard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as those brought in on the first cruises of the True Blooded Yankee or the Comet or the Grand Turk or the Governor Tompkins , or the General Armstrong or the sloop Polly out of Salem , or the Harpy of Baltimore , privateers that made enormous sums from the beginning , and harried the British until the very mention of their names was enough to cause a flutter in the insurance rates . We found Nantes a good town , as Captain Boyle had told us , though there was an air of depression and sorrow to the place , and unusual numbers of womenfolk . For every man that met the eye there were three women  --  all on account of the millions of men that Bonaparte had slaughtered in the making of his vainglorious wars . There was infinite detail to the sale of our cargo , which had to be done slowly by French agents ; and after that there would be the figuring of shares and the refitting for another cruise , so I left the crew aboard the sloop and went to take lodgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , narrow building facing the Place du Commerce , near where the small river Erdre flows through the city and into the Loire . Captain Boyle had told me that all American captains patronized L'Aigle d'Or when they were in Nantes , because the proprietor , M. Marcel Solbert , had spent several months in America and learned what he believed to be English . M. Solbert met me at the door and immediately proved that he thought he spoke our tongue . " Ah ! " he said , clasping his hands in front of him like a woman . " Ah ! Gentiman , you are capitaine , eh ? Ah , oui ! Gentiman , you live Philadelphia , no ? I have work wiss livres in maison de livres de mon ami , M'sieu le Comte Moreau Saint-Wry in Philadelphia , eh ? " He took me to my room , a narrow room with windows opening on a courtyard smelling peculiarly of stables , soapsuds and cheese rind ; and when I came down I met three other American captains , all waiting impatiently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the letter-of-marque schooner Ned of BaltiP137more ; Captain Troutman of the privateer schooner Lion out of Marblehead , and Captain Hewes of the privateer Leo out of Boston . Through them I found agents  --  the Latour brothers : polite men with bushy whiskers large enough for squirrel nests  --  and thought to settle down to wait for our rich booty to be turned into money ; but there was such an air of discomfort about the country , what with Bonaparte 's terrible battles and the ghastly news of the death of four hundred thousand Frenchmen on the steppes of Russia , and the conscriptionsthat were forever taking place to provide more men to be slaughtered , that none of us could rest easy . We set out again in February to chasten the British , believing that when we were back from our cruise the Latours would have settled our affairs . Yet I think-I would have done better to stay on shore : for we were twice chased away from prizes by British frigates ; and when the cruise was over the men , headed by Rowlandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger vessel and crew so we could man out our prizes . When we were back in Nantes , furthermore , I found the Latours had disposed of our cargo to such good advantage that I dared not tell the crew for fear their newly acquired wealth would make them unwilling to risk their skins in fighting ; since every ordinary seaman 's share now amounted to something better than twenty-four hundred dollars . Consequently I kept my own counsel , banked the money with the Latours , refitted the sloop ; and early in May , when the hawthornswere pink-and-white clouds against the rich green of the swelling fields , we slipped down the Loire again and stood off toe northwestward on a cruise that , for general cussedness , would have been difficult to beat . We ran straight into one of the hellish westerly gales that blow Into the Bay of Biscay with hurricane force , kicking up such seas that a sloop the size of ours is stuck against the face of one of them like a fly against the page of a book ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crest of the wave and downward top138the trough of it , with no horizon at all save that furnished'by our own wave and the next one to it . The gale seemed bent on wringing the Lively Lady as a woman wrings a towel , twisting the stern in one direction and the bow in another . We were obliged to heave-to under a double-reefed mainsail , nor did one of us dare move without a leg or an arm hooked around something , lest we be snapped through the air like a whip lash . Fearing for Pinky , I tied him tight in a blanket and corded him to the roof of the cabin , where he hung with head protruding and whiskers a-bristle , barking passionately when lamps were broken from their fastenings and every loose object sent flying from one side of the cabin to the other . After four hours of this a tremendous sea came down with a roar in the wake of our starboard shrouds . It seemed to me we were gone ; but the sloop struggled gradually upright , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top timbers and split open the plank-sheer , so that I could look directly down into the hold . Knowing one more like this would leave us clinging to splintered spars in the cold green surges that towered around us , I sent Jeddy and ' Lisha Lord and Cromwell and Rowlandson Drown to cut loose a spare boom . This we spanned with a piece of new four-inch rope ; and to the bight of the span I had them fasten our small bower cable . The other end of the cable we fastened to our mast . Thereupon we threw over the boom , paying out sixty fathoms of cable , and at once the sloop came head to the wind , riding as easily as a mallard ; for the boom not only acted as a floating anchor , holding us in place , but it broke the ragged crests from the seas and forced them to march at us in a more orderly manner , instead of rushing from every directionlike becrazed things . Thus it gave us a chance to nail tarred canvas over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withoutfurther injury . Following this we gave chase to a ship , lost her in the darkness , cruised two days in search of her , picked her up again , and lost herP139for good during the night . We sighted a brig and hove her to , only to find she was an ancient craft , in ballast and not worth sinking , so we let her go . Then we lay and creaked in a calm for two days , a hot , steamy , uneasy calm , smelling of newly caught fish , after which we suffered from light and variable airs that left us wallowing here and there like a drunken seaman . We were well over toward the coast of Cornwall one dismal morningwhen the lookout sighted two craft in the southwest . We made all sail in chase of them , and when we discovered that one was a ship and the other a small xebec  --  a xebec being a three-masted craft with square sails on the foremast and lateen sails on the main and mizzenmasts  --  it seemed to us our luck had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the ship , she hoisted English colors . It seemed strange to me that she should be so slow a sailer , for she had the appearance of smartness ; so we hoisted American colors , bore up and gave her both long guns , hulling her near the water line . I thought for a moment she had struck , for she lowered her ensign . The men set up a roar ; but there was something about her I misliked . She kept a small yellow flag at her main , which seemed contrary to good sense ; then , in merchantman fashion , hauled up her mainsail slowly and clumsily backed her maintopsail . I shouted to ' Lisha Lord that something was wrong and immediatelywore ship , passing into her wake . When we were in a raking position , ' Lisha and Pendleton Quint gave her both long guns , and we could see the distant cabin windows go out as the grape and the round shot went in . The gun crews stood with open mouths , waiting for her to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wore ; and as she wore she ran up her ensign again . Ports flew open along her gun deck , and we saw she was a heavy sloop-of-war , disguised by closed ports and by having a tier of ports painted on a strip of canvasstretched over the channels , so to look like a merchantman . " My God ! " ' Lisha shouted . " It 's the Gorgon ! "  |p140Her  side disappeared in a white cloud , above which we could see her sails spreading , fast , as no merchantman ever set them . The round shot from her broadside went over us , wailing like giant sea gulls , and there was the clattering hiss of passing grapeshot , a most unsettling noise . I heard a grinding thump from the waist . When I looked along the deck I saw a round shot had caught poor black Sip , the brother of Pomp , and taken his hip away . He lay there looking first at the great raw hole in himself ; then up at Pendleton Quint ; then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise on his face . Pendleton jumped over him and sighted his gun , careful and delicate , as if sighting at a distant goose . He pulled the lanyard , and the smoke blew down across us , setting us to coughing and filling our eyes with moisture . When it blew away , Jotham Carr had got Sip out from under the feet of the men , so they could load with no interference . We made sail upon the wind and left her very fast ; but fast as we left the Gorgon  --  if indeed it was the Gorgon , as ' Lisha Lord said and swore  --  it was nothing to the quickness with which Sip left us . He lay in the scuppers for a time ; for Jotham Carr refused to let us move him , saying it would be no use and would only hurt Sip . He smiled a gray smile up at me . " Gosh , " he whispered in his flat Maine speech , that seemed to me so strange to come from a black man 's lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Brook  --  le 's go fishin '  --  to-morrah --  " So Sip went home to Arundel ; and I , remembering it was I who had persuaded him and Pomp to leave their little cabin on the high land above the marshy banks of our river , wished myself back where I could hear the red winged blackbirds chucking and whistling in the bayberries at the edge of our creek  --  where I would never have to smell gunpowder again . It was the devil 's own work to hold the men in hand and get the Lively Lady out of the Loire again that autumn . The amount of ourp141prize money had leaked out and been magnified in the leaking ; and so sure were the men that they were close to having the wealth of merchant princes that I was hard put to it to make them remember our country was still at war . They let slip no chance to remind me they were set on sailing in a larger vessel than the Lively Lady ; and i knew it to be true that the increasing wariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger craft , heavily armed and manned . None the less I knew the Lively Lady was a lucky boat , whereas God alone could tell what our fortune might be if we changed . Finally I got her to sea again , and the cussedness of this cruise was greater , even , than that of the preceding one . Again and again we were robbed of prizes by the alertness of Brit-h cruisers ; and once a fast British merchantman struck her colorsus toward dusk , let us slip alongside her , then ran up her colors , opened fire once more , cut up our rigging so that our mainsail came own on the run , and finally escaped us in the dark . To cap it all , while we were cruising off the Spanish coast , we found ourselves one dawn in the midst of the whole British fleet supporting Wellington'sarmies . We tacked like a fly dodging a broom , got some holes in our sails and one through our hull , and to escape had to thrower our carronades , so that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When , therefore , we saw the islands of the Loire again , the men ere glum and dark and truculent , and I was no less gloomy than they . There were new faces in the narrow front room of L'Aigle d'Orhen I came into it on a dark night in early December , though CaptainHewes was still there , a bottle of Vouvray before him and a stranger sitting across from him  --  a stranger whose hat perched precuriouslyon the side of his head . Hewes pushed a glass of Vouvray into my hand before I could unbutton my jacket . " We needed you , " he said . " Dawson sailed for home , and Troutman was captured ; and France has too many Frenchmen in it for our taste . Captain Halley and me , we 're getting lonesome . " " Hailey ? " I asked , looking quickly at the stranger . " You hit it ! " Captain Hewes laughed . " He 's the one : captain of the True Blooded Yankee , out of Brest " Now there was no American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True Blooded Yankee , though she had been privateering only since late in February or early in March ; but , accustomed as I had become to hearing fantastic tales of our privateersmen , I did n't believe the tenth of what I heard about the True Blooded Yankee , any more than a grown man believes fo'c'sle rumors of the Flying Dutchman . " Well , sir , " I said to Captain Hailey , " I 'm glad to meet you and find you 're flesh and blood and not some sort of corposant that 's been fevering the brains of the British . " Hailey laughed and lifted his hat , replacing it on the opposite side of his head , tilted at the same dangerous angle . " Why , " he asked . " What have I done now ? " " We heard you 'd captured an island in the Channel and held it two days , " I said . Hailey scratched contemplatively at the corner of his mouth . " That wa' n't quite so , " he said . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . " What happened , " Hailey said , " was that we rammed a wreck - off the Irish coast and had to careen ourselves somewheres and fit two new planks ; so we picked ourselves a nice island and tool , it and put the natives to work . There was an armed schooner that thought different , but we mounted our long guns on shore and sank her . " " How long did you hold it ? " I asked , goggling at him . " Heh , heh , heh ! " Hailey said . " Six days ! " Hewes raised his eyebrows at me . " He took nine towns in Scotlandand Ireland and held ' em for ransom ; and he went into one harbor and burned seven vessels . He came home with two hundredP143and seventy prisoners and a four-million-dollar cargo , in addition to the prizes he manned out . " " Oh , here , here ! " Hailey protested . " It wa' n't four million dollars ! " " How much was it ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hailey said . He checked on his fingers . " There was twelve thousand pounds of raw silk , eighteen bales of Turkey carpets , twenty boxes of gums , a hundred and sixty dozen swan skins , twenty-four packs of beaver skins  --  oh , gosh ! Say three million and a quarter , or three and a half , or so . I 'm going up to Paris now to see Mr. Preble . He 's owner . " " Well , " I said , " you made a great haul ! " Hailey hitched-forward in his chair . " I tell you , I 've got a fast brig . She 's fast ! And I got a crew that wo n't be took . They 'll outshoot and outfight anyone . " " Why will they ? " I asked . " They wo n't outshoot and outfight my crew , man for man ! " " Yes , they will , " Hailey said . He tilted back in his chair with an air of confidence . " Yes , they will ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had some hokus with the French , and we searched the prisons for seamen : American  --  English  --  anybody that wanted to chance it . " We stared at him in silence , and he smiled at us . " Was you ever in a French prison ? " We shook our heads . " No , " he said , " and you do n't want to be . These men of mine , they wanted to get out , and they do n't want to go back . And the English among ' era , they do n't want to be took . If they 're took they 're swung from the yardarm quick . Quick ! Real quick ! Why would n't they fight ? I 've got a big crew , two hundred of ' em ; and you never saw anybody shoot faster and straighter than they shoot , when they have to . I 've got a fast brig , and there ai n't anything going to get away from me when I start out after her ; not anything ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a terror to the British , and I wondered how I would like a crewp144taken out of French prisons ; but before I could make up my mind , I heard someone running along the flagstones that edged the river . There is little running in French towns on dank December evenings , when all good Frenchmen are snugly sealed in steamy kitchens ; so we fell silent and looked toward the door , where M. Solbert , his hands cupped around his eyes , had pressed his forehead against the glass to see who it was that pelted so unceremoniously beneath the silent elms of Nantes . The rapid footsteps came closer . M. Solbert fell back suddenly from the door , and in that moment it opened . Tommy Bickford stood before us , blinking and peering about the room . There was a smudge of soot on his cheek and a charred hole in the front of his pea-jacket . He came to me . " Cap'n Dick  --  the sloop ! She burned ! " He made a quick little bow to Captain Hailey and Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she burn to the water ? " I asked . " Yes , Captain . " " How 'd she catch ? " Tommy looked at Captain Hailey and then at Captain Hewes . " Speak up ! " I said . " I think I know . They set her , I 'll bet ! They saved my papers and the long guns , did n't they ? " " Yes , Captain : they saved pretty near everything . " " Then they set her , " I said . I turned to Hewes and Hailey . " They wanted something bigger , so to carry more men and man out prizes . " Hailey laughed dryly . " I can tell you where to find the extra men , ' " he said . " I can show you all the nicest jails in France . " So there was I , who wished to shorten the war , left without a vessel . I thought of the miniature in my pocket and stared at Hailey , while it seemed to me clear that I 'd have most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows from home.  |p145TEE  brig I got to take the place of the old lucky Lively Lady I bought from a fox-faced Frenchman , Robert Surcouf : she lay in the basin at La Rochelle , and we were three months reconditioning her . Privateering was no new venture for her : the fox-faced Robert Sur- .. uf had sailed her and fought her years before against the English  --  sailed her and fought her in such a manner as to bring him undying fame . Her figurehead had been a white shrouded woman of wood ; and Surcouf had called her the Revenant , which means the Ghost ; and always , in Surcouf 's hands , she had disappeared like a wraithfro m the fastest British frigates that hunted her . But six years before , rich from the taking of prizes , Surcouf had married and given his life his word that he would fight no more ; and being determined  --  at the British should never touch her , yet wishing to have her someherewithin reach , he had dismantled her and laid her up , a dismastedhulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuading and 4,000 English pounds to get er from him ; and on top of everything I was obliged to sign a paperat I would never allow her to fall into the hands of the British. living gone that far with him , I brought my crew from Nantes to Work upon her , and they did it with a good will too ; for not a man of them but cuuld see , under the lumber and the pigsties and the steep-roofed penthouse with which she had been disguised and disfigured , her beautiful run and great breadth of beam . " Fifteen knots ! " Surcouf had bragged . Yet when I saw her made fit for the sea again , I doubted that he had bragged at all . We rigged her as she had been rigged when Surcouf had sailed her  --  as a tauntriggedbrigantine : square-sails , that is , on her foremast only , and high-masted . Her mainmast was a handsome tapering stick ; her upperspars drew out into topgallant , royal and skysail masts that seemed as slender and fragile as the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her shrouds and stays , beautifully fitted and served with hide wherever they lay in another 's chafe , were so few in number that a landsman would have deemed her as sparsely rigged as two fishing poles , and therefore useless . Our two faithful long guns stared grimly from their ports amidships ; and sixteen carronades , which had come with the brig when I bought her , were lashed snugly on their slides . Her decks were scrubbed ; the bolts and rings in her high and solid bulwarks shone clear and bright . Except for her riband she was painted a dull green , against which her copper shone like newly minted gold . We gave her a black streak , set off from the green by stripes of gilding ; and I went down over the bows myself with RowlandsonDrown , bent on making her figurehead into something that would keep me from forgetting I must do whatever lay in my power to help make this war a short one . We cut away the shroud from the head and body of the corpse Surcouf had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows , and making the shoulders smooth and sweetly rounded : then fashioned a snug little dress that flowed back into the cutwater . The lips and the eyes I carved myself with my jackknife ; and when she was done we painted her carefully , the face a creamy ivory with a faint flush to the cheeks , the lips a brilliant red , and the hair a copper color , like that of a copper bolt chafed by the rubbing of a rope . The dress was a beautiful shimmery green with shadows and high lights , so that a breeze seemed to be whipping it around her . When she was finished , one evening early in March , I walked down to see how she would look in the moonlight , and Jeddy went with me , and Davy Maffett , captain of the privateer brig RattlesnakeP147out of Philadelphia  --  the same Davy Maffett who had sent prizes valuedat one million dollars into Norway during the winter just past , and as daring a captain as ever sailed . We stood on the quay of the basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and St. Nicolas Tower bulking against a moon of burnishedsilver . Davy Maffett looked and looked at the figurehead and whistled a little . Then he crossed the quay to a near-by tavern and returned with three bottles of sparkling white wine . We popped out the corks , and Davy held up his bottle toward the green-clad figure under the bowsprit . It gave me a strange tightness in my throat to see her there , smiling a faint , tremulous smile , as though she well knew what we were doing but was too much of a lady to look around at us . " Here 's to the Lively Lady , " Davy said . " May X11 of ' em want her but none of ' em catch her ! " " The Lively Lady ! " we shouted , and drank ; and that was how we rechristened her . One hundred and twenty men she carried , but I had not taken all of Captain Hailey 's advice , though I had taken some . All of the hundred and twenty were Americans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Rochelle were the roughest and wildest of the ten dozen . They came in charge of Alley McAlley of the old crew , that little Irish tailor from Arundel who had signed with us because of his admiration for Jotham Carr , who had cured him of the itch . He had picked up an intelligible jargon of French and had been combing the coast towns for stranded fellow countrymen of the right , rough sort . With them he also brought , sewed into the waistband of his trousers , a letter given him in Nantes by Captain Jacobs of the **25;771;TOOLONG schooner Kemp . It was from Captain Boyle ; and when I saw his name written at the end , he flashed into my mind , dark and handsome and polite , P148standing on a carronade , his Comet slipping over the waves like a flying fish and he waving his hat at me . " ESTEEMED sin AND r cn , " the letter said , " by good chance I have fallen across my brave friend Captain Jacobs , of the letter-of-marque schooner Kemp , Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health and success . Until the fifteenth March I shall hold station about one hundred miles west of the Scilly Isles , to intercept vesselsbound into the English Channel or the Irish Sea . If it suits your wish and convenience we can keep company there or thereabouts . If not , I will run for Nantes on the fifteenth March , hoping to have a snail or two with you before refitting for another cruise . I am in a new brig , Chasseur , sixteen long 12 's , and she is able to sail a little . If you come out , be so kind as to hoist a pair of blue pantaloons to your main peak , so there may be no mistake , and I will run up a green silk petticoat with . ruffles . I am in great hopes of encounteringyou , and trust that if you come out , you will bring a few bottles of sparkling wine and a cheese or two . I have a partiality for the white Roquefort cheese , though any cheese will do . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my distinguished regard . " Thos . BoYLE . " I read it again to make sure of the date and the cheese . " Get your men aboard , " I said to McAlley . " We were only waiting for you . " I touched my breast , feeling that little oval of mine under the outer cloth ; and I bethought me of how Captain Boyle rounded the convoy , burned a British ship , and came blithely to have me for dinner with him . I thought , too , that in Captain Boyle 's company I might at least help a little to shorten this war . " Get your men aboard , " I said again , " I 'm going to buy some cheese and wine to take to Captain Boyle on his Chasseur a hundred miles west of the Scillies. "  |p149It  was late in the day , with a cold westerly wind seeming to hold up the sun in a smutty sky the color of a newly blacked eye , when we rounded the point on the northerly side of the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fast , for there was a lift to her , almost like that which I felt as a child , when I swung in the long rope swing hanging from the high oak on the far side of the creek in Arundel  --  alift that caught my breath and filled me with the exultant sensation of being about to soar on and on , into another world . The harbor of La Rochelle is a pleasant harbor in ordinary times , and as safe as any harbor anywhere ; but in 1814 it was bad because of the manner in which blockading frigates and sloops hid themselves behind the shoulders of Ile de Re , and pounced on Americans coming out of shelter . We were a quiet lot as we bore to the north , past La Pallice and toward Breton Pass , the seventeen-mile- sound separating the Ile de lie from the mainland . There were lookouts at the mastheads ; and I had put ' Lisha Lord in the larboard fore chains and Cromwell in the starboard fore chains to con the brig . Jeddy and Cephas were driving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when a craft first puts to sea , and so keeping them occupied ; but they were as quiet as the rest of us , for until we were clear of the narrow channel , and the greenish half light had thickened into a comfortableblackness , there could be no feeling of security in the mind of anyone . This presentiment of danger was justified as we slipped past the eastern end of the Ile de Re ; for the two men aloft shouted , " Sail ! " sharply and simultaneously . A second later ' Lisha bellowed , " Cruiser in the lee of the island ! " and in the same moment I saw her topsails dimly  --  topsails with such a tremendous high hoist that they could belong to nothing but a frigate . I remember saying to myself , " To hell with this ! " for due to the narrowness of the channel , we could n't possibly escape a broadside if we held our course . We went about , then : almost we spun around , P15o as if some vast hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her heel . I heard laughter from the men in the waist , and a whoop or two , and knew they were laughing with delight at her swiftness . We slipped back along the eastern tip of the island in the gatheringgloom . I find it hard to make clear the feel of swiftness in a vessel . It is a little like that which comes into the body of a runner at times  --  a quick consciousness of lightness and suppleness , as though running were no exertion , and could be continued indefinitely . Our sloop had been a fast craft ; but there was no such feel to her as to this brig , which seemed to pour herself over the waves without effort , adjusting herself to irregularities in the water like an otter gambolingin the rapids of a fast stream . She moved , it seemed to me , with a soft rush , a tireless swoop , a smooth unchecked flight , devoid of bumpings and squatterings such as mark the progress of slower craft . I have watched kestrels come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering of the wings : then turn without effort and soar away on a straight , effortless flight , very rapid ; and it was like a soaring kestrel that the Lively Lady seemed to move . There was still light in the west when we hauled our wind to pass out along the southern side of Ile de Re ; but the light was dim and faintly greenish , which was fortunate for us . Against this dying paleness , as we opened the island , the lookouts made out two more sail , two miles off our starboard bow , running down with the wind on , such a slant that they were bound to intercept us . I could feel in my bones they were British frigates or sloops-of-war , and I knew they must have learned there were American privateers in La Rochelle and so been sent to blpckade the port . I had no love for this situation . Our canvas was new and bright ; and since they had surely seen us I knew they would separate , one edging in toward the Ile de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also knew that if either of them passed within gunshot of us , which was likely , we would get a broadside that might wing . P151us and leave us swinging in circles on the water like a wounded duck . How long it was before darkness hid those two sail from us I cannotnow recall . It may have been two minutes ; it may have been four ; but to me , watching this beautiful brig slash over the waves like a frightened swan , it seemed like an hour out of a sleepless night . I shouted for lanterns and called ' Lisha Lord aft to step a mast in the longboat ; and while he worked at it with his men I sent a seamanpart way up the foremast ratlines with a lighted lantern . When it was dark at last , a thick gray dark , we came into the wind and hung there . ' Lisha lowered away the boat , lashed its tiller , made fast a lighted lantern to the masthead , scrambled back on board , and cast her off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern he was carrying . The empty longboat bobbed away from us toward the Ile d'Oleron , the lantern bright at its masthead . We watched it a moment , then wore ship and stood back toward the Ile de Re . We may have been a quarter mile off shore when Jeddy spoke and the men jumped for the topgallant clew lines and the fore clew garnets . They worked as though bawled at by the Bull of Bashan ; yet I had to strain my ears to catch Jeddy 's muted whispers . " Peak and throat halyards ! Jib downhaull Rise tacks and sheets ! Let go ! Clew up ! " I heard him whistle a shrill little whistle between his teeth and add , " Settle away the main gaff , you ! " In another two minutes ' time we were slipping along with every inch of canvas furled , as dark and silent as a deserted brig , so that an enemy vessel would be obliged to run us down , almost , in order to see us , and would , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear. ' ' here was a creaking as the head yards were squared : then we bore up before the wind and lay there , listening . There was a small moaning of the breeze in the rigging , and a slatting somewhere above us , and the lap , lap , lap of the waves against our bends . Far off to larboard we could see a pinpoint of light , blinking and blinking ; then disappearing for a second ; then blinking and blinking once more . We watched it and watched it , until it seemed nearly gone : only a spark now and again . We peered for it until moisture ran from our eyes and lay cold on our cheeks ; and as we peered there was a flash like sheet lightning seen through a rift in a cloud : then a thud , as though someone had dropped a weight far down in our hold . We saw two lights , one close under another , rising , and knew one of the cruisers was hoisting her signal lanterns . Immediately , fartheraway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jeddy to make sail . Jeddy shouted , and the crew sprang up from under the bulwarks , cheering and whooping ; for like the rest of us they knew the cruisers had gone too far afield after our longboat to locate us again  --  that there was nothing now between us and the open sea , and that , once free of the land , no British cruiser ever built could overtakeus . In four minutes ' time our sails were set and drawing and we were running to the northwest , all clear . P153It WAS early March still , a blustery bright day , and we were castingaround in a circle west of the Scillies when we made out a sail on our weather quarter , coming down on us fast . When she proved to be a brig , we bent on the pantaloons  --  a pair belonging to Cephas Cluff , who was large in the bends and with next to no tumble-home about him  --  and ran them up . Instantly a billowing green ensign of some description went to the brig 's masthead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " There 's ruffles on it ! " " The Irish navy ! " Jeddy shouted ; and since we were delighted to encounter Boyle again , we combined business with pleasure while waiting for him to come up , hove over a cask , circled it , and banged away at it fifteen times with our lee battery , thus giving him a salute of fifteen guns . This brig of Boyle 's , the Chasseur , was as beautiful a vessel as it had ever been my fortune to see . She was brigantine rigged , like the Lively Lady , but with a lighter bowsprit and foremast and more of a rake to her sticks , so that she seemed to me to have a quicker and more elusive look than the Lively Lady  --  the look , almost , of a slender girl running hard , her head back and her stomach thrust out before ter . When we had fired the fifteen guns , we tacked twice and came back onto the Chasseur 's course , slipping along beside her not fifty yards away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainsail where the passage of a bushel of grapeshot had been repaired , and theP154wind-blown hair of the grinning crew that lolled , close-packed , over the hammock nettings to watch us come up , and the fluttering ruffleson the bosom of Boyle 's shirt . He stood on one of his long twelves , clutching the main shrouds and waving his bell-topped gray beaver at us . " Very kind ! " we heard him shout . " Too many guns ! Hope I can live up to the compliment ! " He looked around at his helmsman , making a little circular movementwith his hand . The Chasseur hauled her wind and ranged closer . We could hear the crackling and whipping of the green silk petticoat at her main peak , the patter of the foam clouts skittering from beneath her raking bows , and the babble of her crew as they talked and laughed . " Delighted you came out , " Boyle called over . " Did you bring the cheese ? " I nodded . " I 'll come aboard for dinner when it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , for the day turned gray and dirty , and the wind shifted into the northeast . In the afternoon it stiffened to a gale , so that both of us lay-to under double-reefed mainsails . That night it eased up , and by morning the wind had come around into the south , and there was a light fog that began to burn off around ten o'clock . When it lifted we saw a sail to the southwestward ; and since Boyle was the nearer to it , he hauled his wind in chase , while we bore on toward the northeast . Toward noon we made out a column of smoke in the southwest and concluded Boyle had found his chase to be a small craft of little value and so set her afire . A little later the shreds of mist in the northeast cleared away still more , and we made out a large ship off our lee bow , heading in a southeasterly direction  --  a magnificent , freshly painted , high-sided vessel , bearing all the earmarks of a merchantman . When she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were right and so piped all hands to quarters . We came up on her fast , and I could see she was armed withP155stern chasers . Therefore I kept off and sailed past her , sending extra muskets and loaders to Moody Haley and Moses Burnham and the rest of the sharpshooters in our tops . Then I came down on her bows , wore across them in a raking position , fired a gun , and shouted to her to heave-to . Instead of this she attempted to wear in order to give me a broadside . This she could not do , because of our speed ; for , seeing what she was about , I came up into the wind very sharp and crossed her bows again , wearing immediately afterward . Even then she would not strike , thinking perhaps that because I was movingstraight away from her I was running . Therefore I turned once more and ran back to windward of her . As we came up , ' Lisha Lord shouted to the men in the tops , and they opened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at her guns , so that when her broadside let off it was ragged and useless , and the shot passed around us and over us . Also two men in succession were shot down at her wheel , and an officer on the quarter-deck slipped to his knees , clutching at his shoulder . Immediately after , a man ran out from the cabin hatch and hauled down her colors , and she slowly hove-to , at which we came about and ran up to leeward of her , with our crew shouting so triumphantly and stamping so delightedly at their good fortune as to drown the slatting of the reef points against the mainsail . Nor was my own pleasure any less than theirs , for we had sufferedno damage whatever in the encounter , and the Lively Lady had outsailed her bulky antagonist as readily as my little dog Pinky runs in circles around a cow . I boarded her myself , to see what disposition to make of her peopleas well as what manner of prize crew to put into her ; and I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her myself , because of her cleanliness and her broad , scoured decks , splotched here and there with the red stains that had resulted from our musketry fire . Even before I made a move to take possession I began to plan how I could have her for my own some day . Five men were laid out in the shelter of the main hatch , and the remainder of her people , gathered around them , glowered at us as we came over the side . The officer who met us , a young man , seemed to expect harsh treatment ; for his lips were pressed tight together and his face was pale . " Captain ? " I asked him . He cleared his throat . " Second officer . The first was shot through the shoulder . The captain went to his cabin when  --  when we struck . " " Lower away your longboat , " I ordered , " and send your men aboard my brig . What is this ship ? " " The Pembroke , West Indiaman , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " London for Port-au-Prince . " " Well , get your boat away . I 'm putting a prize crew aboard . " I left Jeddy in charge of the deck and went to the cabin . I had heard about the richness of big West Indiamen , but I had never been aboard a wealthy Londoner before ; and here was one indeed . She was 540 tons : a roomy , comfortable ship ; and when I stepped into the cabin , I was staggered by what I saw . Two silver lamps were hung on long silver chains ; and beneath the lamps was a dining table , covered with gold brocade weighted at the corners with silver tassels . Behind the table rose the rudder case , carved and colored to represent a close-packed stand of bamboos ; and these , at the top , branched out in feathery green fronds , all carved out of wood , which spread interlaced across the ceiling . Behind that , in turn , were the stern windows , hung with blue brocade . The cabin walls were paneled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edgedingold , so that the bamboo of the rudder case was reflected back and forth . Doors let into side berths , three doors to a side ; and in a recess stood a piano colored gray to match the cabin panels . There was a scarf , a green scarf , across the piano bench ; and it seemed to me I caught from it a singular delicate fragrance . A sallow-faced man sat at the table , his chin sunk on his chest , staring at a handful of papers that lay before him . When I came in he rose and bowed , a quick , angry bow , as though he would rather be whipped than do what he was doing.  | " Captain , " I said , " I must ask you to take whatever personal belongingsyou require and go at once aboard my brig . Do you have passengers ? " " You have the authority for this , no doubt ? " " A commission from President Madison , sir , to Captain Richard Nason of the private armed brig Lively Lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at that moment one of the cabin doors swung open . I stared and stared at what I saw ; for beyond the open door , swaying to the uneasy motion of the ship , stood a slender girl , a girl in a green silk dress , her pretty arms bare to the elbow , and her hair , tight braided around her head , the color of -a copper bolt chafed bright by rubbing . As for her face , it was the same as that on the miniature I had carried in the pocket of my shirt , for fear of losing it , ever since the distant day when I sailed from Portland in the Neutralityto carry foodstuffs to the English in Spain . Just then it did not seem to me so necessary to shorten this war . P158IF EVER I saw a man in a rage so powerful that he was on the verge of being poisoned by it , it was Sir Arthur Ransome when he learned he must leave his comfortable West Indiaman and go aboard a crowded brig not half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry to man out the Pembroke and send her on her way to Nantes , for I had learned she had been driven from a convoy by the gale of the day before ; and there was no knowing when a fast frigate might come prowling down in search of this fine fat chicken that had straggled from the flock . But say what I would to Sir Arthur , I could not hurry him in his preparations . He stood by his berth , quite helpless , asking his wife in his whiny voice where he had put this and where he had put that . He would pick up a thing and stare at it helplessly : then hand it to her to hold , looking like a baulky horse ; and with each passing moment he seemed more and more impatient with her , though shehadonly tried to help him . At length I asked her if she was ready to go . She said at once , without looking at me  --  and indeed , she had not looked at me at all except when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . At that , unwilling to endanger our crew or our prize by further delay , I called to Jeddy to send down Gideon Lassel and Seth Tarbox . When they came , I told them to enter Sir Arthur 's cabin , take every movable thing except Sir Arthur , and dump the whole in a blanket . This they did , regardless of Sir Arthur 's angry protests . Then Gideonp159threw the loaded blanket over his shoulder , and Seth took Sir Arthur by the back of the coat and pushed him on deck . I sent Lady Ransomeafter them and followed her out myself ; and as we went we could hear Sir Arthur expostulating with Seth , telling him to take his hands away . They tumbled him into the boat and jumped in after him ; whereuponJeddy and I handed down Lady Ransome , and I gave Cephas Cluff his final orders : to head for Nantes and sell the Pembroke to the Latours for one hundred francs , so she might lie safe at her French quay , and be readily repurchased when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latours , giving Cephas authority to draw on them for funds and live aboard the Pembroke , keeping her neat and ready for sea , until I should come for her . No sooner had I gone over the side than the Pembroke slipped off to the eastward , toward Nantes . Raging as Sir Arthur was , he was silent in the boat  --  not , I felt , from good sense , but because it was a part of his scheme of life to show no feeling publicly before menials ; and it was as a menial , I knew , that he regarded me . At all events , he sat stiffly on the thwart beside Lady Ransome , staring over my head at nothing . I was glad of this for two reasons , one being that if he had opened his mouth , the boat crew , being in high spirits over the taking of the Pembroke , would have mocked him in some dreadful way , since nothing seemed to strike them as being as laughable as the speech of an Englishman ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figurehead of the Lively Lady as we came down on her lee bow , although he was a dull man about some things and might not have seen it even though he looked directly at it . I could have wished , even , that Lady Ransome had been less curiousabout her destination ; but as luck would have it she cast a glance over her shoulder at the brig when we were less than ten paces from her dolphin striker ; and as a result she looked squarely at the figure Rowlandson Drown and I had fashioned and painted with such care hi the harbor of La Rochelle  --  at the copper-colored hair , the brilliantp16o red lips , the bare pink arms and the shimmering green dress with the look of being whipped back by the wind into the duller green of the cutwater . With lips a little parted , she stared and stared ; and I , watching her , had the singular impression that only a few days had passed since I first saw her sitting in a field near Saco , with my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no heart to dwell overlongon this strange feeling , for when she turned from the figurehead , her eyes met mine in a glance so level that it appeared almost to have something of enmity in it . I think Sir Arthur would have resumed his arguing as soon as we set foot on deck , had I not sent him , with his wife and Captain Parker , to my cabin until the brig was squared away toward the south on the lookout for the Chasseur , and until the wounded first mate was comfortably stowed in one of the side berths off the gun room . I had the feeling that I had done something wrong , nor was this feeling lessened when I went into my cabin and met the accusing gaze of Sir Arthur and Captain Parker and saw how Lady Ransome refused to look at me and stared at nothing from the stern windows . " Well , " I said . " I regret this had to happen to persons I know , but war 's hard on friendships . " Sir Arthur whinnied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed . " Oh , well , " I said , feeling sorry for them , " it 's hard on everything , and since we must live on this craft for some time , I 'd like you to know I do n't relish making prisoners of people who have been in our house and eaten our food . " With that I went to logging them , and so discovered from Captain Parker that Sir Arthur was on his way to Jamaica , where he had been threatened with the loss of vast sugar lands through litigation . It came into my head , when I learned this , to ask Lady Ransome whether Annie had come safely to England in the brig in which I had placed her and the Sandersons ; but when I looked up at her I thought I saw apprehension in her eye and so said nothing . P16I " Just what do you mean , may I ask , " Sir Arthur said , when I had put away the log book , " by saying we must live on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " I mean just that ! I ca n't set you adrift in an open boat , and I think you 'll agree that the water 's a trifle cold for swimming . " Sir Arthur stared at me along his nose , an unpleasant look such as he might have given to a servant . " I warn you , " he said , " that you 'll be held to blame for any harm that comes to my wife or myself or any of our property , and that you 'll be treated like any other pirate when you 're taken , as you must be . " " Well , " I said , " no harm 's going to come to any of you if I can help it , so make your mind easy on that point . And since you bring up the matter of blame , I 'd like to ask your captain what was in his head when he allowed this lady to remain in the cabin and refused to strike his colors to me . " Captain Parker moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Parker is an experienced navigator , in whom we have the utmost confidence , " Sir Arthur said . To me his voice sounded finicky and unpleasant . " In that case , " I told him , " I can only remind you that if my brig had n't been faster than anything Captain Parker had ever seen , I 'd have been justified in raking you through your cabin windows , which As something I do n't like to think of . " They stared at me without speaking . " There 's another thing , " I said , as calmly as I could . " It seems to e it 's a little singular to choose this time to travel , even in a convoy d with a captain in whom you repose confidence . " " Oh , indeed , " Sir Arthur said . " Indeed ! Words fail me to express my gratitude for your interest in my personal affairs ! It would doubtlessmean nothing to you to know that a fair part  --  a very fair part  --  of the island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE LIVELY LADYp162My answer was both gruff and awkward . " I do n't see , " I said , " why you should bring a lady along . " " Do n't you ? " Sir Arthur asked quickly , his face the color of fresh putty . " That 's truly unfortunate ! " Lady Ransome bent her head over her clasped hands and spoke for the first time , her voice so low and husky I could scarce hear it . " A lady that has to be watched , " she whispered , " would need to be brought along . " Sir Arthur turned on her . " Hold your tongue ! " he said quietly . " Is this any place to discuss our private affairs ? " Into Lady Ransome 's eyes came a foggy , wavery look that set me off on another tack , talking more loudly than I might otherwise have spoken . " Now , here ! " I said , " if you 'll give me your paroles to do nothing that can damage or hinder this brig or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe port . " There was venom in Sir Arthur 's glance . " And what if I do n't choose to give my parole ? " " Well , sir , " I said , " if you wo n't give it , I 'll have to demand it . The lady must be put ashore . " At that Captain Parker gave his parole , as did Sir Arthur , and I sent for Tommy Bickford to help make them as comfortable as was possible in our cramped quarters . Late in the afternoon we fell in with the Chasseur again ; and when Boyle , standing in his main chains , shouted gaily at me to tell hirrs'Ywhat I had been doing , I thought it best to lower a boat and go aboard the Chasseur , so my passengers might not hear me spreading their affairs to the world . I told Boyle about Sir Arthur and asked him to join me for supper so I would n't feel like a voiceless fool when Sir Arthur became talkativeover his wine and favored me with his rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiceless under such conditions ? " he asked . Not wishing to tell him it was because I did n't want to hurt Lady Ransome 's feelings , I contented myself with saying I became voice-P163less because Ransome persisted in addressing me as though I were a groom or a scullery boy . Boyle nodded thoughtfully . This , he said , should amuse rather than anger me . " His wife , " he said , " has thick ankles , no doubt , and a raw , carroty look , like so many English-women . " My reply , perhaps , was overwarm . " Not at all ! She 's rather good-looking . " " " Indeed ! " he said , " and what 's the color of her eyes ? " " They seem to be green , but in reality they 're a sort of smoke color , " I told him ; whereupon he turned from me to open his chest of old Madeira . I saw he was smiling , and wondered whether I had made a mistake to admit knowing the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I had sat alone at supper with Sir Arthur and Lady Ransome and Captain Parker we would have been a glum and silent gathering ; but men from Baltimore areattlers , seeming to talk for the pleasure of hearing the sound ofeir voices , which are soft and slurry , doubtless from living in close proximity to Negroes . . Boyle had no sooner come into the cabin , with his white teeth , his clear , sallow skin , his gentle politeness and his soft , warm voice , than Captain Parker brightened up , and Sir Arthur took a reef in his chin , that his nose came down out of the air and left him looking likey normal human being , while Lady Ransome smiled for the first time since I had seen her open the door in the cabin of the Pembroke . Indeed , no woman could have helped smiling if Boyle had be Jed over her hand as he bowed over Lady Ransome 's , saying as he did so , his repays me , ma'am , for being a sailor ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dirty weather , and theneaven sends us  --  " he straightened suddenly and looked earnestly at her  --  " and then Heaven sends us a pair of eyes the color of smoke in the swamps of Maryland . " He looked around at me , as if to make sure I heard what he said , whereat I flushed as red as the turkey cover on the table . " Lud ' a ' mercy ! " Lady Ransome cried with an air of unbelief ,   " you 're never from America , sir , speaking such poetic nonsense to me . " Now your ladyship is paying compliments , " Boyle said , " whereas I was telling the simple truth ! Tell me , now , what part of England you think I come from , if I 'm never from America , as you say ? " - " Oh , not England ! " Lady Ransome exclaimed hastily . " I meant I did n't know American men spoke  --  I did n't know they were in the habit of --  " Boyle chuckled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . " It 's a large country , Lady Ransome , " he said . " Our products vary widely . Now in the North we have the Province of Maine , where the people never speak for fear of committing themselves to something ; but farther to the south we have Maryland , where we 're trained from childhood to fall in love at first sight continuouslythroughout our lives . " " You 're speaking now of the training of maidens and ladies ? " she asked , " or do you mean your gentlemen would never fall in love unlesstrained to ? If you mean the latter , your ladies must all be perishing of broken hearts , I take it ! " Captain Boyle laughed lightly . " No , ma'am ; it 's only our own hearts that break , and that without any training . " Sir Arthur cleared his throat with what I considered unnecessary loudness . " Are you the captain of a privateer , Captain Boyle ? " " I have that honor , sir , " Boyle said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , " Do you ever find men of standing serving as captains of privateers ? " Sir Arthur asked almost genially  --  due , probably , to the rapiditywith which he had tossed off his wine . " Never , sir ! " Boyle assured him quickly , " only a lot of scamps like Captain Nason and myself . Some of our privateer captains have been downright notorious . " He rolled up his eyes at the ceiling and went to checking off names on his fingers . " Truxtun , Porter , Biddle , Decatur , Barney , Perry , Murray , Rogers , Cassin , Little , Robinson , Smith , Hopkins . . . terrible low fellows all of them ; but they re-P165formed and entered the navy , as I have the greatest fear you already have the displeasure of knowing , sir . " He sipped his wine smilingly , and then went on : " Now , let me see : Captain Nason wants to send you to England , and he said something about taking a small brig and turning her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Lady Ransome and drank the remainder . " It teems to me I would n't advise a cartel . She might be taken by anotherAmerican before reaching port . As you doubtless know , our government pays a bounty for each prisoner , and you might possiblytaken to America . " " But we 're nearly in the English Channel ! " Captain Parker pro --  led . " There ca n't be Americans in the Channel , my dear sir ! " Boyle raised his eyebrows at me . " Had you understood the Chanelhad been cleared of our privateers ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " We 're in it already , and Captain Hailey of the True boded Yankee is fond of cruising in the Channel when he is n't siding towns for ransom in Scotland and Ireland . The Scourge , the attlesnake and the Grand Turk are Channel cruisers , and there are seven or eight others standing off and on the coasts of Great Britain , ough they may not be in the Channel at the moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I fear , sir ,  --  ur mind has been less on the war than on other matters  --  or , possi-y you 've listened to unreliable information . " It was Lady Ransome who finally said she was quite sure Captain yle 's advice would be worth following , at which Captain Boyle ' wed and flashed his white teeth at her . " That 's kind of you , a'am , " he said , " and I appreciate it . I must tell you , too , that you n have complete confidence in Captain Nason 's judgment , for ough he 's young and a great believer in Maine taciturnity and notmitting himself to anything , he 's as good a seaman as ever I kept . company with . " The fiery heat of my face was not cooled by the somewhat discouraging silence that followed these words of Captain Boyle 's ; and t length , in desperation , I quickly swallowed a glass of wine and said it seemed to me the best thing to do would be to run to the Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track , and set our prisoners ashore on one of them . From here , eventually , I said , they would get passage to England in a government sloop or schooner , and would be safe with English folk meanwhile . " There ! " Boyle cried . " What did I tell you ! A perfect arrange-ment ! " The others , however , had nothing to say , but sat and pecked at their supper . At length Sir Arthur observed dryly that after Captain Boyle had boasted of the manner in which Americans were making themselves at home in the Channel , it seemed not unnatural to hope his party might be landed in Plymouth harbor . Captain Boyle smiled at him as sweetly as a newly wakened babe smiling up into his mother 's face . " Where our privateers go , " he told him softly , " depends a little upon the reward in prospect . When they risk themselves out of kindliness , they must take some account of numbers . You are three , and Captain Nason and I have a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur , might be willing to venture their skins for a prize worth the good part of a farm to each of them . But I think they 'd mislike Plymouth harbor as the scene of a Christian deed performed without even the prospect of being thanked for it . " Lady Ransome raised her eyes to mine for a moment ; then dropped them immediately . " Ow , " Sir Arthur said at length . " Remarkable , your speaking of thanks , Mr. Boyle ! Attacking us without a word of warning when we were harming nobody  --  that might be defined as somewhat cowardly , might n't it ? You put it all as a wholly commercial matter , you and your men , as I understood you to say , thinking only of how much money 's to be made out of it . If you 're to do a brave act , there would first have to be a calculation of the pennies to decide how many of them your bravery may be worth . "  |p167For  my part , I could have wrung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Captain Boyle seemed undisturbed . " Yes , " he said , " I 've heard that before ; but as it just chances , I 've always heard it second hand . Not before has it been said to me directly . I feel a little unfortunate that it 's thus spoken at last by a captive ; but since we 're so happy as to have a lady with us , I 'll explainthese matters more fully than I would ordinarily do . Thus you may be able , hereafter , to state the case properly . " Captain Boyle rose , walked to the stem windows , drew aside the curtains and peered out . " A fine starry night , " he said . With that he returned to his chair , and , as he came , fixed the back of Sir Arthur 's head with a hard , level gaze . " Well , now , " he said , " this is the way of it . Most people in this world seem to be in the position of doing things for money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers , generals , admirals and ship-builders ; your poets and your writers of books : all these men earn a living by what they do ; and by stretching a point you might say it 's a commercial matter with them . Why , I 've even heard it said your great families in England marry oftener to gain a few acres of land or a sure addition to their incomes than for love . " He paused and looked shyly at his fingers , the most harmlesslookinggentleman I had ever seen , and I was astonish &d; to discover that Lady Ransome was as white as the linen at Captain Boyle 's wrists , and that Sir Arthur 's leathery , dust-colored face had gone a muddy red . " Yes , " Captain Boyle went on gently , " we 're most of us money chasers in this world , though some of us chase it more grimly than others , and others chase it because they 're whirled along with the chasers . " Now , you gentlemen may or may not be aware that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with your tremendous fleet of eight hundred men-of-war ; but this is a fact . It 's also a fact that many hundreds of Americans  --    many thousands of them  --  are eager to do battle with a nation that has so flouted and insulted their country as has England . " Captain Boyle leaned forward and looked wistfully into Sir Arthur'sface . " What 's to be done in such a case ? " he asked . " These men are seamen : all their lives they 've known nothing but the sea . They 're lost on land ; and the ways of landsmen are beyond them . They 'd be worthless in an army ; and besides , they 've no quarrel with England on the land . It 's on the sea that England treads on our toes and denies us the right to be our own masters ; and it 's on the sea that Americans wish to fight for free trade and seamen 's rights and no impressment . " Captain Boyle , it seemed , could not sit still . He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oak rudder casing , swayingas the brig , rising to the lift of a wave , swooped with it and lowered herself gently to the bosom of the following wave . " What can these people do who want to fight you ? " he repeated , looking from Captain Parker to Sir Arthur . " There 's no room for ' em in our navy , on our few small government vessels . What am I to do when I want to fight you ? I 'm a navigator . I can work a brig or a ship , and work her well . I can fight her . Shall I go as a common seaman on one of our twenty-two government craft , where my knowledge of seamanship will be lost ? What are the rest of us to do ? " Captain Boyle 's voice fell almost to a whisper , so that I leaned forward for fear of losing his words in the slight screaking of the rudder and the lapping of the water against our sides . " You have a vulnerable spot , you English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet . We 're striking home , Sir Arthur Ransome , when we send the price of flour in England to fifty dollars a barrel  --  to sixty dollars a barrel . " " Ah , yes , " Sir Arthyir said . " And getting the sixty dollars yourself , Mr. Boyle ! " Taking a handkerchief of gray silk from his breast pocket , Boyle smoothed it between the palms of his hands ; and as he did so he lowered his head and looked into Sir Arthur 's face as intently as though there were nothing else worth seeing in all the world . " Ip169think I 've made myself quite clear , " he said . " I beg , therefore , you 'll indicate in some way to me that you 've labored under a misappre-hension . " Sir Arthur met this intent look now bent upon him for a moment or two only ; then lowered his eyelids and glanced aside . " Oh , I 've no doubt it 's a fair enough sort of fighting , according to American ideas , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lifted his glass to Captain Parker , then lowered it . " On second thought , Captain , " he said , " I ca n't ask you to drink with me to the fortunes of war just at present . " " No , " Parker returned gruffly . " And they would n't be what they are for us just now except for the damned laziness , saving Lady Ransome'spresence , of our damned blockading fleet that 's supposed to hold your privateers inside your own ports . How you get by them I 'm damned if I can see , saving Lady Ransome 's presence again . " " Oh , but it 's the simplest thing in the world ! " Boyle said . " We hack out . " " Back out ? " Parker repeated , with a kind of hoarseness . " Back out ? " " Let me explain it , " Boyle said winningly , and turned to Lady Ransome . " You see , ma'am , your people have a heavy blockading fleet cruising up and down before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out stern foremost : that is to say , backwards ; and your people look at us carefully and think we 're going the other way . So they do n't bother us . Sometimes we have to back halfway to the Scilly Islands ; but , after all , what could be simpler ? " Captain Parker sputtered , grunted , and seemed to be swearing internally . Lady Ransome said , " La ! " and looked purely scornful , whereupon Boyle lifted a protesting hand toward her . " You 'll not betray me , ma'am , " he said , " for giving this information to the enemy  --  I 'm afraid I must regard your husband and Captain Parker as enemies ; but I 'm sure they 'll be honorable and not betray the secret . Doubtless you know yourself , ma'am , that Sir John Bor-P170laise Warren had it published in England how well he holds the Chesapeake blockaded ; but as a hundred and fifty American privateersare constantly passing in and out of those lively waters , Sir John could only be excused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore thinks they 're all inside . " When he had said this he sat staring at Parker . His face had suddenlybecome as blank as a clam shell . His eyes seemed turned inward , and his lower lip sagged , so that he looked to be gone entirely from us . Then , as abruptly , a little glow appeared upon his cheek . He came to life , smiling , and turned to me . " Blockade ! " he said . " Why , what fools we 've been , Captain ! Warren'sin America , blockading us ; and we 're here , so why should n't we blockade them ? " " Blockade who ? " Sir Arthur asked . " The British ! " Boyle cried , striking his fist on the table . " Captain Nason , we 'll blockade England . " " Good ! " I said . Captain Boyle clapped his hands softly and rubbed them together . He slid from his chair to walk up and down the end of the cabin , beaming delightedly at me , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , Captain ! " he said . " Pencil and paper ! This blockade must be effected at once ! " I went to my dispatch box for writing materials ; and thinking all eyes were on Captain Boyle , I stole a glance at Emily Ransome , only to find she had looked suddenly over her shoulder at me . It was the same level glance she had given me once before ; but now I saw no enmity in it ; for when she turned quickly away , her face and throat flushed hotly red . I fumbled in my dispatch box as though my fingers were turned t4 thumbs . I forgot , almost , what I had come to get ; I heard but dimly the voice of Captain Parker , plainly outraged by Boyle 's remarks . " It seems to me , Captain Boyle , " he said , " that what you say is in extremelypoor taste ! " Boyle stopped abruptly in his pacing . " Poor taste , Captain ? " heP171asked , as if he doubted his ears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker made a sound like an outraged goose . " Such a thing 's impossible of accomplishment , " he said , " and you 'd never say it to our naval officers ; so it must be said for the purpose of irritating us , who are helpless here in this cabin . " " Why , sir , " Captain Boyle said , and I thought he spoke regretfully , " I 'll ask you to pardon me if I 've irritated you . That was n't my intention . " " He raised his eyebrows at Lady Ransome . " Have you found my words irritating ? " " I find them pleasantly fantastic , " she said , smiling at him . Boyle shook his head sadly . " Not fantastic , " he said . " They 're meant more soberly . Why , here  --  " he turned to Captain Parker  --  " it 's not half as impossible for me to blockade England as for Sir John Borlaise Warren to blockade America . And I question your judgment , my dear sir , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to naval officers . I 'm quite willing to say it to anyone . " He seemed struck with a new idea . " I shall insist on saying it to everyone ! You shall carry my proclamation to London , Captain Parker , and post it in Lloyd 's Coffee House ! " Take it down for me , Captain , " he said , seeing I had brought pencil and paper . " Take it down ! We 'll make three copies , so all Great Britain may be warned . " Thereupon , with a mocking spark in his velvety brown eyes and the gentlest of smiles playing about his lips , he wandered around the table , dictating to me , seemingly oblivious of the rigidity with which Sir Arthur and Captain Parker sat in their chairs . " At the top , " he announced , " the word Proclamation , ' printed large , and flanked by American eagles with ruffled feathers , if you 're any hand at drawing eagles : if not , we 'll get along with American ensigns . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and italicized , and with that we can start . " His voice rose a little and became flat and monotonous . " Whereas , It has become customary with the admirals of Great Britain , commanding small forces on the coast of the United States , particularly with Sir John Borlaise Warren and Sir Alexander Cochrane , to declare all the coast of the said United States in a state of strict and rigorous blockade without stationing an adequate force to maintain said blockade ; " I do therefore , by virtue of the power and authority in me vested , possessing sufficient force , declare all the ports , harbors , bays , creeks , rivers , inlets , outlets , islands and seacoast of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in a state of strict and rigorous blockade . " " Ow ! " Sir Arthur protested . Captain Boyle held up a warning hand and continued his dictation : " And I do further declare that I consider the force under my command adequate to maintain strictly , rigorously , and effectuallythe said blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two small vessels ade-quate ! " " Why not ? " Boyle asked . " Look at Warren ! " He nodded at me and resumed his flat , monotonous dictating voice : " And I do hereby cautionand forbid the ships and vessels of all and every nation in amity and peace with the United States from entering or attempting to enter , or from coming or attempting to come out of , any of the said ports , harbors , bays , creeks , rivers , inlets , outlets , islands , or seacoast under any pretext whatsoever . And that no person may plead ignoranceof this , my proclamation , I have ordered the same to be made public in England . " Given under my hand on board the Private Armed Brig Chasseur , THOMAS BOYLE , Commander . " Captain Boyle came and looked over my shoulder . " I date it as from my own ship , as more fitting and proper , if you 'll pardon me , Captain Nason . Have you it all ? " " I think so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me sourly . " In reference to the supposed British blockade of America , it might be nearer to the truth if you inserted , before the words about stationing an adequate force , the words without possessing the power to justify such a declaration : " " My dear Captain , " Boyle said , starting back wide eyed , " the proc-P173lamation would have verged on the inaccurate without such a phrase . I thank you a thousand times for the suggestion ! Pray make it so ! " With that , smiling graciously upon us , he caught up his hat and swept a quick bow to Lady Ransome . " Charming evening , " he told us . " I shall hope for others before the blockade ends . " P174IT WAS thick as pea soup in the Channel on the following morning : thick and choppy ; and it seemed to me there was trouble in the air ; for Pinky lay in my bunk , his head hanging across my legs and his beady black eyes wide open , now elevating one bushy yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the cabin , and between times growling faintly deep in his throat ; so in the end he drove me to dressing and going on deck at an early hour . I could make out nothing in the fog . Pomp , standing his trick at the wheel , his face like polished ebony from the wetness of the air , jerked his head to larboard and said he had caught a glimpse of the Chasseur 's topgallant sail half an hour earlier . There was no breeze to speak of ; only light airs from the west that left us wallowing and creaking in the oily cross-seas , with steerageway but little more ; so from our reef-points and top-hamper there was a slatting and whackingreminiscent of a hailstorm on a barn roof . The suggestion of a barn , indeed , was one that came to me readily , because of the barnyardflavor of our waist , where there were sheep pens and crates of fowl . One of the men brought me a cup of coffee , stout enough to hold up a nail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbnessof eye and brain which often accompanies changeable weather . Pinky stirred himself between my ankles , where he was resting , and peered out around my leg . Feeling his stub of a tail begin toP175thump , I looked around myself and saw Lady Ransome had come on deck , a dark green kerchief bound around her head like a Spanish fisherwoman 's , and her fur cloak wrapped tight about her . I gawked at her , my cup half raised . " Well , " I said , staring . " Well  --  what are you  --  where --  " " Is it hot ? " she asked , looking at the cup . " Yes , " I said , holding it before me as if waiting for someone to throw a marlinspike at it . " Let me have a little , " she said , and took it . " Wait ; I 've been drinking from it . I 'll send for more . " Even while I said it , she drank what was left , watching me over the rim as she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , think of another thing to say , and only stood looking at her until she put the cup back in my hand , which was still half open in mid-air . " What would your aunt Cynthy say if you gave her coffee like that ? " she asked . " What do they put in your coffee ? Rusty iron ? " " It seems to me , " I said , " it seems to me you look thinner than when I saw you in Arundel . " She seemed almost to study over her answer . " How is your mother , Captain Nason ? " " She 's very well . She helped me with this sloop . No : this is a brig : she helped me with the sloop I had before this . " " When did you see her last ? " " Why , only a short time ago . Last fall . No : it was longer ago . A year ago . No : it was over a year ago : it was a year and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the tide streaks always to be found in the dirty gray water of the Channel , which has as many cross-currents as one of our marsh rivers within a few minutes of flood . Only the night before , it seemed to me , there had been scores of things I wanted to say , if I could catch her alone for a moment . Yet now that I was alone with her , and she surprising me by seeming to be in a friendly mood to boot , my brain was as muddled as a plate of lobscouse . Nothing would rise to the surface.  | " There are sticklebacks in England , " she said at last . " They live in the ditches . In London I found a print of a woodcock flying with one of its babies held between its knees , as you said . Has your head hurt since that day ? " I told her it had n't , and wondered why I had to be so dull and stupid . " I suppose you 've helped other girls cut their initials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better carvers than I. La , how crooked my letters were ! " She laughed a gay little laugh , though it seemed to me she laughed overlong . " I fear you 're always following after the women . " " No , I 'm not , " I said , hoping my voice sounded stern and truthful . " Why , " she said , " there 's one under your bowsprit at this moment . Are n't you afraid she 's leading you on , Captain Nason ? " " Leading  --  leading me on ? " I stammered . " She was a ghost when we got the brig . She was pale  --  she looked entirely different . " " And you had her changed afterward , Captain Nason ? " " I changed her myself , " I said . I intended my words to have no double meaning , but I thought she eyed me strangely . We stared at each other . She stooped suddenly and picked up Pinky , pressing her cheek against the top of his head . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pleasant young man . I saw Annie too . Did you see Annie ? " She nodded . " You said nothing to my brother about knowing me ? " she said . " No , I did n't . Did you ? " I knew she had n't because of her sudden interest in adding to the roughness of Pinky 's eyebrows . " Why was it you said nothing to him ? " she asked . " I do n't know . Maybe because we 're at war . No : I do n't know why . Perhaps for the same reason I did n't tell my mother about your picture . " " What picture ? " she asked , wide eyed .   " Why , " I said , wishing I had held my tongue , " the one you  --  the one Annie --  " " Where is it ? " I fumbled under my coat and had to rip the button from the pocket , so clumsy were my fingers . I got out the picture at last and unwrapped the silk handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her . Certainly , I thought , she had grown thinner , and there was a look in her eyes that had never been in them when I first knew her , and that was not in the eyes of the miniature  --  a look I have seen only in the eyes of prisoners . She gazed steadily at it , turning it between her fingers : then , before I realized what she was doing , she dropped it inside the collar of her dress . " Here , " I said , " here ! " and I found myself with my hands stretched out toward her , as if to snatch it back again . " There 's been a deal of trouble over this , Captain Nason . " " But , " I said , " it 's  --  I 've carried it  --  you can't --  " " Where did you find it ? " " It was in my coat when I sailed . It had slipped through a hole in the pocket . I 've never let it out of my hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It brought me more talk than was ever caused by the Great Plague ! Now there 'll be no more of it . " She hummed a tune under her breath . " You mean you 'll tell your husband you 've found it , and he 'll stop talking ? " She nodded , without interrupting her humming . " Stop a minute , " I said . " Shall you tell him how I happened to have it ? And where I was carrying it ? " " Of course , " she said , looking abstractedly at the masthead . " Well , " I told her , " if you 've been talked at till you 're sick of talk , as I suspect you are , I 'd give the matter more thought . I think it would be safer with me . It 's brought me luck , and I 'll try to see no harm comes to it . " The man at the masthead shouted , " Sail on the larboard beam ! "  | The fog , I saw , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze to speak of . Peer into the fog as I would , I could make out nothing . There was confused shouting near the forecastle . ' Lisha Lord came aft to say the lookout had caught sight of a craft with two royals when the fog lightened for a moment . How far away , ' Lisha said , he was not sure . A mile ; maybe less : maybe more . " Was he sure of the two royals ? " I asked him . If there were two it could n't be the Chasseur . She was a brig-schooner like ourselves and carried only one . " He says two , " ' Lisha insisted . We peered to larboard , but the fog hid what lay beyond us . We could see it drifting like smoke above the water , with little rents and alleys in it , as though it were being pushed aside , here and there , by objects invisible to us . While we stared and stared into that blank gray wall , our mouths open and our muscles tight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cottony thud struck our eardrums like a ghostly finger pressed against them . We seemed to float in a thick , motionless world  --  a world without breath or life ; and as we waited so , a burst of cavernous thuds tumbled on each other 's heels irregularly , like the distant barking of two monstrous dogs . I knew on the moment what had happened , as surely as though I had looked through the curtain of fog and seen it . The Chasseur had blundered into an enemy craft of some sort ; and what would happen to her , with no breeze for maneuvering , God alone could tell . In no other way could the matter be explained , and our duty , as I saw it , was to find out whether it was indeed so . There were two ways , I knew , of finding out . I could send away our boats loaded with boarders ; or I could run out the sweeps and move the brig herself in range . Since the Lively Lady moved easily , I figured she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manned and got away and rowed to an attack : also I felt that our guns would be needed , and if I depended on boats , the guns would be useless .   " Get out the sweeps , clear the waist of lumber and pipe to quarters , " I told ' Lisha Lord . He ran down the deck . Irrelevant thoughts popped into my head , such as that ' Lisha was from Bath and as smart-looking an officer as could be found on any British man-of-war , and that we were lucky to have him to point our guns . The brig was a turmoil of running and shouting , with the shrilling of the bos'n 's whistle threading through it , as is always the case in a sudden call to quarters ; and over everything continued the hot , sepulchral roaring of the guns , pressing thick , moist air against our faces . Jotham Carr ran past , to turn my cabin into a hospital , Tommy Bickford at his heels to stow my dunnage and bring me my fowling piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head , so I caught Tommy by the arm and turned to Lady Ransome , who had been wiped from my mind by the thudding of the guns . From the waist came a disquieting baa-ing and cackling , as the men hove the livestock over the bulwarks ; but there was a faint fixed smile on Lady Ransome 's lips , a smile that would stay there , once she had put it on , it seemed to me , even though the whole world fell to pieces around her . " Go with Tommy , " I told her . " Get your husband and Captain Parker . Tommy 'll take you below , where there 'll be no danger . Do n't be afraid . " " I 'm not afraid , " she said . I knew there was something I wanted to ask her , but there were too many things on my mind , such as how these other vessels might be lying , and whether ' Lisha had kept shot hot in the galley , as he had spoken of doing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was trying to remember what I wanted to say , I saw Captain Parker step on deck . Behind him was Sir Arthur , weak looking and the color of the little sponges that grow in the rock pools of Arundel , near low-water mark ; so I knew he had been made ill by our wallowing in the calm . As they appeared a burst of gunfire stopped them in their tracks . P18o Parker shot a quick look at the fog that hemmed us in ; then peered at the men casting loose carronade slides , tricing up ports , manning the sweeps , and running like ants with shot , powder , water pails , rammers , and muskets . " Look here , " he said , stepping up to me , " what 's happening here ? " " Nothing you need worry about . Go below with Lady Ransome . " Sir Arthur 's face was green . " Owl " he said . " I ca n't permit this . " I remembered , then , that I had wanted to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " Take your husband below , " I told her , " and be quick about it . Keep the dog . He 'll be company . Do n't let him loose . He likes the guns . " She nodded , a bright nod , and went away with Tommy , the two Englishmen following her , and Pinky peering back at me from around her arm . Moved by the sweeps , the brig was swinging to larboard , toward the hoarse bellowing of the guns . I told myself we must see the vesselssoon , since they could see each other ; that it was the Ransomes ' own fault , getting into this trouble ; that if they had n't wanted trouble , they should have stayed in England , where they belonged ; that I had n't lost a man so far , only poor Sip ; that my mother would say that what I was doing was all right , if she were here . That 's the way of it with me , I 'm sorry to say : When close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to no bearing on the matter in hand . A spout of water shot thirty feet in the air off our starboard quarter , giving me a picture of how they lay , broadside to us and two cable lengths ahead . The gun crews , silent at their stations , pointed and whispered when they saw the spout . We swept off to larboard again , so we could come up under their bows or stems , in a position to rake . I felt movement in our topsails , the beginning of a light breeze . In the same moment the lookout shouted again , and as he shouted we saw them dimly , their top-hamper showing through thep181dissolving fog , their hulls hidden , except for patches here and there , in layers of smoke . We came around more , until we lay broadside to them , our bow to the westward . They were pointed northeast , a pistol shot apart . The nearer one was a ship-rigged sloop-of-war , a corvette , with Britishcolors at her peak . Her foretopmast was cut through at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap in a tangle . The mizzenmast trailed over the counter , with the jagged stump of the mast rising from the wreckage . Through the smoke we saw her people hacking away with axes to clear the decks . Yet there was life in her , and plenty of it . The Chasseur , dimly seen through the smoke , seemed a ragged wreck of the swift brig that had skimmed the waves beside us on the day before , though I well knew that a vessel , though apparently cut to pieces , could be nobly patched by a skillful crew in an hour 's time . Her main-boom was shot through , her foretopgallant yard was broken in the slings , and her bowsprit dangled in splinters and festoons from her stem . Her sails were riddled and shredded from the passage of grape and round shot , so I knew the Britisher 's gun crews were shooting too high . In the moment when the two craft became clear to us through the thinning fog , a man pitched over the side of the Chasseur 's maintop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , turning slowly in the air and vanishing in the smoke . " Get at them with muskets , " I told Jeddy , " whenever our people can shoot without hurting the Chasseur . I want no gun fired till we can rake . " The breeze died again , and the guns roared thunderously , almost in our ears . A little futile spattering of musketry set in from our tops . The men were under the bulwarks , stripped to the waist ; for even in cold weather there is a feeling of greater security if no coats or shirts hamper the arms or shoulders , and if belts are pulled tight at the waist to ease the shrinking in the stomach that comes with fighting . Our eyes burned and watered with the fierceness of our peering , P182for there 's no time to meditate when creeping into position within easy range of an enemy , waiting for the gunfire you know must come . And creep we did ; for though the men drove the sweeps through the water until it whirled and sucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for the lifts and lurches of the brig as the waves had their will of her . Yet we moved ; for there was a sheep pen clinging against our side , with three half-dead sheep in it ; draggled , wretched , staring-eyed beasts that blatted and blatted as the cold Channel chop slapped unendingly at them ; and this pen moved slowly backward from our waist . We had swept a little beyond the Britisher before she opened fire . It may be that between the men needed to work her guns and musketsagainst the Chasseur and those who chopped at her tangles of spars and cordage , she had no men to waste on us , or she may have hoped to force the Chasseur to strike and then engage us . Whatever the reason , we were nearly ready to turn again and sweep under her stem when she let go her starboard battery . There was a whirring and rattling of grapeshot above us as the smoke jetted irregularly from her side , a small downrush of severed tackle , and the rasping shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved forward to reassure the men , but they stayed where they were , those at the sweeps pushing hard ; the men under the bulwarks lying tight , some with their arms over their heads to guard against splinters , and some with their faces screwed around toward the quarter-deck , grinning . I could see the Britishers ramming home charges at the starboard ports . We would have two minutes , I knew , before the next broadside : maybe three , and maybe even four . I could make out officers on the quarter-deck as the smoke drifted away ; and I wished , as I had never wished for anything in my life , for a breeze to drive us around under her stern so we could rake them off . ' Lisha Lord moved from gun to gun in the waist , tinkering with them , almost like a woman prodding at her hair , striving to get itp183just so . Suddenly he straightened , whirled , and jumped for the quarter-deck . " By God ! " he shouted , " it 's the Gorgon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let off at us again , as though in protest at ' Lisha 's words . We felt the push of air against us , and a hellish clattering and whirring all about us , so I knew she had pointed her guns better . To this day I can not kick a gray-winged grasshopper from the dune grass of Arundelin late summer without feeling my heart turn over in my breast ; for their whirring is like that of flying wood splinters ripped from masts and yards and bulwarks by round shot . I could see splinterspass in a shimmery yellow mist , and felt a quick ache in my left shoulder , where a small splinter had driven into me , point first . The men at a starboard sweep were sprawled on the deck , knocked there when the sweep was shattered by a round shot . Our foretopmast swayed , then buckled with a sound of rending timber , and hung loose and draggled . A man toppled over the edge of the foretop , twisted in mid-air and clung by his hands . I saw Moody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt , and heave him back into the top . One of the men crawled out from beside a carronade . Blood gushed in spurts from his neck . He reached the musket stand by the main hatch , pulled himself to his feet , then fell again and lay still , a black stream moving slowly from under him . Jeddy hustled a new sweep to the starboard sweepers , and RowlandsonDrown bawled at his men to cut away the foretopmast . I pulled the splinter from my shoulder , thankful when it came out easily from the bone , and told Pomp to put over the helm . " All ships look like the Gorgon to you , " I reminded ' Lisha . AutomaticallyI figured that if nothing happened to us we would be in a position to rake in three minutes . " Like hell they do ! " ' Lisha said , his voice shaking as if with cold . " That 's the Gorgon ! I thought it was the Gorgon when I got a look at her through the fog ! Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diamonds ! That 's mine , by God ! I made it ! "   It was in diamonds , as he said ; and as I peered at her , wrapped in smoke and littered with her tangled top-hamper , it seemed to me I could recognize , on the quarter-deck , the burly figure of Captain Bullard-Jones . Smoke gushed from her starboard battery once more . " One  --  two  --  three ! " ' Lisha counted , above the howling and rattling that followed the discharge . " Three ! They ca n't bring the others to bear ! " " Give ' em a gun , " I said . " Keep it away from the Chasseur . " I thanked God , as ' Lisha jumped for the long gun , that the Gorgon had been able to bring only three to bear ; for these three had left a ragged , furry hole in our mainmast , shattered the bottom of our longboat , and stretched Rowlandson Drown on the deck ; while something , though there was no way of knowing what at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wheel had whirled suddenly in Pomp 's hands , throwing him to the deck with wrists half broken . I saw Jeddy run to Rowlandson and pull at his arm , looking at his face ; and from the way he let his arm drop and turned away I knew Rowlandson was dead . ' Lisha worked at his gun , squinting and squinting . The deck jerked as he fired , and in the same moment the sternmost gun of the Gorgon 's starboard battery , struck fair on the muzzle by ' Lisha 's shot , kicked backward and exploded . The crew of the long gun leaped like jumping jacks , sponging and loading . " Load with one shot ! " I heard ' Lisha tell them . " There 's a hot one goes on top . " He ran down the deck toward the galley , slapping at the gun crews . " Steady as a rock ! " he shouted . " We 'll never have no such gun platform again ! Right into her guts , boys ! " We crept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but slowly : as slowly , almost , as the moon comes up beyond the brown rocks of Cape Arundel . Her masts , wrapped in a tangle of sails , spars , shrouds and running rigging , drew closer together as we brought them in line , and up through them rose white wreaths of smoke from her guns ; for still she hammered at the Chasseur , and still the ChasP185seur hammered back , though the roars of both had a labored , weary slowness . ' Lisha ran from the galley , behind him two men with pails . I saw a long gun emerge from one of the Gorgon 's stem ports and slowly come to bear on us . My muscles were tight as barrel hoops , and I wanted to crouch behind the bulwark for a second  --  for half a second even  --  to do anything except stand and wait . ' Lisha Lord shouted to the gun crews of the long guns . They dumped the shot from the pails into their guns , and ' Lisha ran for the forward carronades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was langrage  --  old iron and bolts and pieces of kettles and nails  --  and it screamed around and over us as though the sky were filled with angry cats . ' Lisha 's first shot went through the cabin windows of the Gorgon . His second smashed her rudder . Our men came up cheering from behind the bulwarks , all a-drip from waiting . They cheered and swabbed and cheered , and last of all ' Lisha ran to the long guns loaded with hot shot . Perspiration dropped from Jeddy 's chin as he shook his fist at the Gorgon and screamed at her , in a shrill , cracked voice , to strike her colors . The long guns roared out of a welter of white smoke . Aboard the Gorgon we heard a muffled , anguished cough , as though some great hulk of an animal had coughed in deathly sickness . The smoke lifted ; the cough died ; then rose immediately into a roar . The wreckage of her mainmast and mizzenmast reeled ; and up from her midship sectionsprouted a bell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blossomed into a mushroom of smoke and suddenly climbed up and up into a flame-shot column , in which moved black , broken objects , turning slowly as they mounted . A strange silence came down upon us and on all the sea as well . It was silence , and yet not silence ; for in the distance there was a rushing noise from within the column of smoke that still mounted upward from the Gorgon , until it seemed to hang over us like ani86 THE LIVELY LADYp186enormous maple tree in full leaf . We heard a rasping and creaking from our damaged top-hamper , and a sickening moaning from a wounded man in the foretop . " Lower away the boats , " I told Jeddy . There was a walloping splash hard by our counter , and thumps here and there on our deck , followed by a rush of falling fragments , hurtling down at us from the sides of that cone-shaped cloud . The hull of the Gorgon had opened out like a melon suddenly dropped on the ground , but now her bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close ; then slowly and wearily widened once more ; and the bow and stern , wavering and groping as though feeling their way beneath the surface , settled deeper and deeper into the gray water of the Channel until it came to us suddenlythat they were entirely gone : that there was nothing left of the Gorgon but a welter of planks and broken spars and splintered fragments , with heads here and there among them , and over them a vast , ever spreading umbrella of smoke . From those heads among the wreckage there rose a faint , thin piping , like the distant calling of young frogs such as we hear in Arundel on warm nights in the spring of the year . P187THE men were knotting and splicing the rigging , plugging the shot holes in our hull and nailing lead over them , and making ready to fish our wounded masts and spars as soon , almost , as the boats had been lowered away ; for they knew , as well as I , that the English Channel was no place in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were helpless as a shark with his tail cut off . We would be fit to maneuver , I knew , in a half hour 's time if there was nothing to worry us but our masts and spars and rigging ; for no seamen in the world are so quick and handy at repairing ship as are American seamen . But in addition to our top-hamper we had our rudder to consider ; and when we came to look at it we found we had no rudder at all , the rudder post having been cut by a shot , and the whole machine having wrenched away . Thus we could n't move until we made a false sternpost , or preventer sternpost , reeved a rudderof plank to it , fixed it in place , and fastened the false rudder in turn to the main chains by guys and tackles . This is the devil 's ' own job , and we laid out the necessary gear on the quarter-deck , to save time and trouble ; and into this turmoil came Sir Arthur Ransomeand his wife and Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , at least in those brought up among decent people , although some Englishmen seem to take pains to discourage Americans in that belief . To me Sir Arthur Ransomeseemed to be such an Englishman ; and I wondered where I could stow that green-faced nuisance before he offended my crewP188with one of his ill-considered remarks , and so got himself thrown overboard . Even as I did so he came to me , radiating offensiveness . " Look here , Nason , " he said , in that whiny voice of his that set my teeth on edge . " Captain Nason to you , " I told him , feeling savage from anxiety as well as from the discomfort in my shoulder . " For God 's sake , hold your tongue till we 've put ourselves in order ! " " Ow ! " he said , stiff and contemptuous , " Lady Ransome asked --  " " She 's not hurt ? " I snapped , conscious that the very thought made the deck seem to lurch beneath me . " She wishes to be of assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring at the clotted splotch on the shoulder of my shirt , so that I was reminded to put on my coat again . " I could n't myself : very squeamish stomach on the water . " I thanked him as well as I was able . The cabin , I told him , was no place for a woman ; and we could somehow make out by ourselves . I never had any doubt that Sir Arthur Ransome thought me a boor ; and just then he was no doubt entirely right , though I tried to console myself by thinking he had never had to supervise the makingof a preventer sternpost and rudder . The fog was growing steadily lighter . Directly overhead was a patch of blue sky . The cat's-paws were steadying , so I knew we would soon have a breeze from the west . The boats were coming back from the wreckage of the Gorgon ; and men were swarming in the rigging of the Chasseur like snails on eel grass . Her bowsprit was in place once more , though the bobstays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard had been swayed onto the cap , and the main-boom had been fished . I tried to make out Boyle through the glass but could n't find him . Jeddy came over the side while we were reeving guys through the preventer sternpost . " It was the Gorgon , " he said . " Those peoplefrom the Chasseur , they say they 'll make you King of Maine when we get home . "  | " Well , " I told him , " I 'd rather have their rudder , so we 'd be sure of getting home . How many did you pick up ? " " Seventeen . The Chasseur 's boat got about thirty . " " Any officers ? " " No ; only seamen and petty officers . " " Any wounded men ? " " No ; they sank . " " Is Boyle all right ? " I asked him . Jeddy looked at me thoughtfully . " They got hit pretty bad , I guess ; but Boyle , he only got a bullet through that gray beaver of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the deck came to both of us at the same time , because Jeddy coughed and cleared his throat and said we could n't all be lucky ; then turned away quickly to attend to the Gorgon 's men . A patch of sunlight showed on the water near us . Ripples lapped against our side , and it occurred to me that if my luck were what it should be , the fog would have held on and the breeze held off for another hour . " How long , boys ? " I asked the men rigging the tackles on the rudder . One said twenty minutes ; another an hour . A man screamed in the cabin , so I knew Jotham Can must be taking off an arm or a leg . It came to me that he lacked practice in such matters : that it would be better for me to help him than to stand on deck with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company . I had no more than started for the cabin when I saw the Chasseur wear to the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down to see what he could do for us , and I was wishful of seeing him ; but it seemed strange he should wear to the north when we lay southwestof him . I saw him crowd on his studding sails , holding steadily to his northerly course ; and so rapidly did he leave us under this press of canvas that even while I gazed blankly after him , the figures on the Chasseur 's quarter-deck faded to specks and then to pinpoints .   Jeddy came and stood beside me , looking after her . " Well --  " he said . " Well --  " And with that he launched into a string of curses that he never got out of any book , not even one of Tobias Smollett 's . It was in the midst of his cursing , when he had become so involved and fanciful that the men at work on the rudder sat back on their haunches to stare up at him , that the man at the masthead shouted " Sail ! " Jeddy stopped abruptly . The men flew at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the northward , beyond the Chasseur . I realizedinstantly that the Chasseur had seen it first and set off at once to intercept it ; and I thought to myself that this is the way of it , often , when a friend seems to go off unfaithfully on other affairs , so that we curse him and soon thereafter lose him as a friend . What the sail might be we could n't tell . It looked to me like a ponderous craft . I had my suspicions , and they were such as to give me an empty feeling in my stomach and a coppery taste in my mouth ; for I had no desire that our cruise should end here in the gray waters of the Channel , with us caught like a rabbit lurching and squeaking in a trap . I could see Boyle holding straight for the sail , and knew he would do what he could ; but I also knew we must make a try at helping ourselves . If she should indeed be an enemy , as I suspected , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , us under way . It was this , I was sure , for which Boyle was hoping . The hole in our mainmast had been fished , and a new topmast swayed up , fidded , and stayed ; so that nothing stood between us and safety except our rudder . Due east , if my reckoning was good , lay the Island of Jersey , largest of the Channel Islands . With a light westerly breeze , prgvided we were able to maneuver , we could turn the Ransomes adrift close to the island and be safe on the Norman coast in the little harbor of Carteret or St. Germain-sur-Ay before sundown . I thought about it ; then called Jeddy and ' Lisha Lord to the quarter-deck . The Chasseur was hull down , but the strange sail , whichp191she had not yet reached , showed the tops of her bulwarks above the water . We needed no word from the man at the masthead to tell us that a ship of this size must be a seventy-four  --  a ship-of-the-line ; and since America had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be a Britisher . " Well , " I said , " we 'll try steering with the sweeps , unless somebodyknows a better way . If we can keep before the wind for five minutes she may run off after Boyle . " They said nothing , but stood staring into the north . As we watched , the Chasseur hauled her wind and went off to the northwest , to windward of the seventy-four . We peered and peered , hoping to see the seventy-four go off on the same tack after her , though we knew no seventy-four ever built could sail half as fast as the Chasseur . " Some of these seventy-four captains , " ' Lisha said , " they ai n't so bad . Either they 're moss-backed old pigs , not fit for eating or killing or anything else , or they know their business . " There was a dull , distant thud , more of a throb in the air than a thud ; then another ; but the seventy-four came straight on . ' Lisha grunted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business . " " Get out the sweeps , " I told them . " Run ' em through the stern ports . " We made sail and wore around . As we came before the wind the sweeps seemed almost to hold her steady . She got fresh way rapidly , held on her course for half a minute , then yawed suddenly to larboard . " Starboard ! " Jeddy , bawled . The men at the sweeps pushed hard at them . The Lively Lady shivered a little , wallowed back toward her course , hung for a moment , then yawed again and broached to . The seventy-four may have been three miles off ; but so accurately was she pointed that if she kept on as she was , her stem would slice us neatly in two , unless we could take ourselves out of her path . The Chasseur had come about and shot past her to windward , and now wore across her bows once more . Boyle , we knew , was armed only with long twelves , whereas the seventy-four must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to us that there was nothing more for him to do . Yet he would not give up . He hove a shot at her as he passed her bows : then tacked twice in quick succession , letting off a gun each time , though he could no more hurt the lumbering hulk that surged contemptuously on her way than a woodpecker could hurt the side of a house . Rowlandson Drown 's assistant had been a gangling young man from Quincy in Massachusetts , one James Combs . At Rowlandson 's death he had become ship 's carpenter ; and it was he who straightenedup from the rudder , shouting , " Get her over . " With ' Lisha Lord and Jeddy climbing around and among them like two inquisitive cats , the men put this rough machine overboard , then lashed the upper part of the preventer post to the brig 's sternpost , and bolted the two together to keep the false sternpost from rising up or falling down . There were men under the stern , working half submerged , with one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were useless , evidently , Boyle had left the seventy-four and was coming down on us under a cloud of sail . Behind him the seventy-four , less than two miles distant , towered upward like an iceberg , glistening white and no less pitiless and dangerous . The men worked at the tackles like figures in a nightmare , slower than anything I had ever seen ; and I was so desirous of getting free of this enormous black-stemmed vessel and the triple line of guns along its side that I was hard put to it to get enough air into my lungs . I stood silent , my hands clenched tight in my pockets and the nails biting into my palms . The machine was done at last , so that Jeddy set up a shout , from larboard and ' Lisha from starboard . With two men handling the larboard tackles and two the starboard tackles of our makeshift rudder , the Lively Lady wore slowly around . She made as though to yaw ; then held steady and slipped more and more rapidly through the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a mile off by now , a tremendous big ship , mak-P193ing the Chasseur , close astern of us , look like a pilot boat . As we picked up speed she fired a gun . Jeddy laughed and waggled his fingers at his nose . " Growl , you black bitch ! " he said ; and indeed there was a look about her of a big black dog showing white teeth at us , in a rage at having a dinner snatched from her jaws . The Chasseur came up under our lee , her crew swarming along her bulwarks and high on her ratlines , bawling and hurrooing at the top of their lungs , and waving their hats and hands until the whole brig seemed aflutter . Boyle was perched on his aftermost long gun , but his bell-topped beaver was not on his head , so that he did not make us one of his fine sweeping bows . Instead of that , he reached up his hands , tightly clasped together , and shook them at us without a word . It occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest and throat that I felt  --  a tightness that came from knowinghim to be safe and grateful for our help  --  and so be averse to attempting any speech . He dragged out his gray silk handkerchief , blew his nose violently ; then smiled and nodded at me . I thought he was about to say something ; but even as I cupped my ear with my hand I saw him cast a quick glance at our foretopmast and stand staring at it , his mouth half open . At the same moment I saw the heads of all his crew swing upward as if drawn by one string , so that every eye on the Chasseur was fixed on our foretopmast . I needed nothing more to know that we were done : not even the ripping , splintering crackle that followed immediately as out new foretopmast gave way two thirds below its head and toppled to leeward ; nor yet the second crash following close on the heels of the first when the foremast , weakened no doubt by the break during the engagement and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hissing groan went up from the decks of the Chasseur as she shot ahead of us , and as we veered around , dragged by the wreckage . There was a queer , absent-minded look on the faces of our crew and of Jeddy and ' Lisha as they stared at the wreck of the foremast , al- most as though they watched a cat sleeping on the deck or some similarly harmless and familiar spectacle . Boyle , I saw , intended to speak us once more . He came into the wind , then wore around , starting to circle us . The seventy-four , still a mile astern , lumbered relentlessly on her way . I turned my eyes from her , knowing I would see enough of her before the day was done . " Work fast , " I told Jeddy . " Get out boarding axes and cut all rigging . Lower away the boats . Get the prisoners on deck and into the boats , and the wounded too . " Boyle ran under our stern , his crew as silent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I heard him shout . " Anything ! Prisoners ? Can I take prisoners ? Any belongings ? Can I take anybody ? Anything ? " There was the least possible chance that one boatload of people had time to pass from us to the Chasseur . I turned to look at the Ransomes and Captain Parker . There was a smug look about Parker and Sir Arthur , for which I could not blame them ; but Lady Ransome 's face I could not see , because she was sitting on the deck , with Pinky still in her arms , and was too busy with him to notice me . " No , indeed , thank you , " Sir Arthur said , in answer to my unspokenquestion , and I remember how mislikable I found his pronunciationof " thank you , " which was " think yaw . " " No , indeed ! We 'll stay where we are ! " I waved to Boyle to go on . " Stand by , " I called to him , " until the Lively Lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyle nodded vigorously ; the Chasseur slipped away into the south ; and to me her , departure seemed like that of an old , dear friend , so that my heart was like lead . The seventy-four was close on us : no more than a half mile away . Our prisoners were on deck and our boats in the water , and Jotham Carr was seeing to bringing the wounded from the cabin . There was only one thing left to be done . Since I wished to be sure it was done , P195I warned Jeddy not to strike our colors till I returned ; and with that I ran forward and down into the carpenter 's quarters . There was an old roundabout jacket belonging to Rowlandson Drown lying on the bench , where he had dropped it less than ten Mutes before he was killed . I picked it up and hung it on a nail Id tried not to think about it as I poured varnish over the shavings d worked with my phosphorus bottle and a match to get a light . The drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled ek on deck pursued by a blast of heat that singed my shirt . The seventy-four , hove-to at pistol-shot distance , was like a black cliff , bristling with guns . Her bulwarks , rigging and ports were a-swarm th men  --  as many as can be found in Arundel and Cape Porpus t together . At the sight of me , Jeddy pulled down our colors with such eager-. , s that I knew the seventy-four had been threatening to throw a of at us if it was not done speedily . I looked around , but could see nothing else that needed doing . cly Ransome sat in the stern of the longboat , still with Pinky in r arms . Beside her sat her husband , his blanket full of belongingst his feet . I sent them away ; then shouted up to the gold epaulettes ining above the gaily painted taffrail that we were on fire and needed boats . After that , as well as I could for the growing heaviness my head , I took my last look at the Lively Lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning privateer is welcome neighbor to any ship . Knowing the customs of our captors , I thought they would put us in that stinking , three-foot-high den  --  the bows known as the cable tier , and leave us to rot in the darkthe slime-covered coils of the cable . I have no doubt that if thisenty-four had been one of the ships used for transporting Ameri-n prisoners , we would have received the same inhuman treatmentsuffered by thousands of captured Americans during the war ; butIt had fallen to our lot to be taken by the Granicus , Captain Wisecommanding , and this Captain Wise was as pleasant and as easy tobe with as any of our own great captains . Why Decatur and Perry and Lawrence and Hull and MacDonough should be quiet , companionable , polite , pleasant , thoughtful men , and the greatest of our fighters to boot , and why our incompetents should have been selfish blusterers , I do not know ; but that was the truth of it . The captains I have named would not , I have heard men say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this was also true of Wise ; but throughout the entire British navy of more than eight hundred ships there was hardly an officer who would nut tie up any member of his crew for the smallest infraction of discipline and see his back chopped into bleeding mincemeat . I say here , in no spirit of rancor , that British naval officers , taking them by and large , were more cruel and brutal than can possibly be realized by persons who are shelteredin peaceful homes , and sleep securely on soft beds under warm blankets ; so to find myself in the hands of a man like Wise was as great a surprise as to drop a hook among a school of sculpins and catch a fat beefsteak . We were paraded before him as soon as we were aboard . He stood at the quarter-deck rail , staring down at us , a thin , tall man , possibly fifty years of age . His hair was crinkly brown , heavily shot with gray ; and he had a habit of half closing his eyes before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an angry remark . " I 'm told , " he said to us gruffly , " that the prisoners aboard your brig were well treated , and I 'm a believer in turn about . I 'll thereforeput you to lodge on the orlop deck , and you 'll be in charge of your own officers until you pass out of my control and into the hands of the Transport Office . I expect orderly conduct from you , even though I 've heard that such a thing is seldom found where American seamen are concerned . Until I 'm disabused you 'll receive the same rations issued to the people of this man-of-war . " He turned on his heel ; then swung back to us again . " I 'd like to see your captain in my cabin . " When I stepped forward he nodded curtly , spoke briefly to a young officer near him , and walked off without another word . P197Tommy Bickford would have followed me with my duffel bag ; but a red-coated marine took it from him . I cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this towering vessel . Back under our lee , a smudge of black smoke pouringfrom her forward hatch , lay the Lively Lady , forlorn and untidy , her foremast dragging in the Channel chop ; her mainsail lying half over the side , slack and useless , like a broken wing . A mile to the south I saw the Chasseur slipping toward the southeast . Even as I looked she hauled her wind and stood back toward us again , so I knew there would be no better days in store for the poor hulk we had just left . Boyle would sink her if she did n't sink herself . I tried to remember , watching her , when it was I had brought the cheese to Boyle ; but I could only remember it was long , long ago . The young officer spoke to me , sharp and haughty , ordering me to follow ; and I stumbled after him with a slack and gone feeling , as though my legs and brain were stuffed with straw . The captain 's cabin in one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the quarter-deck like a rich house set down at the end of a village green ; and I , entering it , felt myself shabby , with something of mendicancy and disgraceful misfortune about me . The young officer rapped at a paneled door and stood aside for me to pass in , looking as though he wished me the worst luck in the world . I entered a low-ceiled room that seemed enormous , larger than our living room in Arundel , and stood before this tall , thin , crinkly-haired captain . He had laid aside his great cocked hat and was sitting at a polished table with a hand on either knee and his lips pursed as though he intended to clap me in chains for life . " I 've been told , sir , " he said , without preamble , " that you purposelyset fire to a prize . " " No , sir ; I did not . " " I have the word of an Englishman for it ! " He eyed me coldly . " I have his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed me so determinedly before I came up withp198you . You told him to stand by until your vessel had been destroyed . " " I did n't strike my colors until after the fire had broken out , " I said . " Then you set the fire ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then in effect you set fire to British property ; for you had no means of escaping and were as good as captured . " " It was n't a prize till I struck my colors , " I repeated , feeling dull and numb . " You might have blown up . " Despite my hair-splitting , he gave me a courteous reply . " So I might ! So I might ! I never thought of that ! " He compressed his lips again and made a flirting motion with his hand . " That 's no reason , however . If you destroyed a prize with no greater justification , I shall be forced to take steps . I 'll be forced to make representationsto the Transport Office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled rumble of a nearingthunderstorm , and I knew I would never set eyes on the Lively Lady again . Something seemed to go from me , so that I could hardly stand on my feet before this captain , who suddenly appeared to me more powerful than any man I had ever met . I saw he was waiting for me to speak . " Well , " I said , " there was no way out of it . I passed my word . " He frowned . " Come , come , Captain ! You 'd better tell me the full tale . And let me have your name , while you 're about it . " " Nason ; the Lively Lady , eighteen guns and  --  " " Yes , " he said , flirting his hand again , " yes , yes ! Wise is my name : Granicus , seventy-four . Now , Captain Nason . " " Well , " I said , " there it is . " For the life of me I could n't remember what he 'd asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you passed your word , did you ? " " Yes . I could n't get the brig till I passed my word she should n't fall into the hands of the British . I passed my word , and so I got her . " " Indeed ! And to whom did you pass your word ? "   " Robert Surcouf , " I said . " Fox-faced man . Damned French pirate . Asked double what she was worth and made me give my word to boot . " " Was that Surcouf of St. Malo ? " " Yes . Surcouf . Look out for him . Had to have her , and he traded close , damn him . There 's worse people than Yankees , and you can tie to it . " " And where did Surcouf get her ? " he wanted to know . It seemed to me his face had come loose from its fastenings , for it appeared to slip sideways : then waver back into place . " Get her ? " I asked . " He built her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a crazy little fool . She never meant Revenge . She 's a ghost . I mean she was the Ghost . I took her out of the grave , Captain , and made her the Lively Lady , but now she 's a ghost that 's laid for good , green dress , red hair and all . " With that , feeling somewhat upset because of the throbbing in my shoulder , I laughed at the thought of the ghost that had been laid  --  laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks and till I had to hang to the table . Then I found myself in a chair , drinking a glass of brandy , and heard Captain Wise at the cabin door , passing the word for the surgeon . " Well , well , " he said , " well , well , well , well ! So that was the Revenant ! Well , well , well ! I should have you shot for that , my boy ! Well , well , well , well ! The Revenant . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedhimself and the regularity with which he nodded his head as he sat staring at me , if the surgeon had not come in , a man both pompous and obsequious , followed by a pimply-faced assistant smelling of medicines . " Now , " Wise said , " anything wrong with you ? Get hurt this morning ? " " No , " I said , not liking the looks of the surgeon . " Nothing . Nothing at all . " Zoo THE LIVELY LADYp200The surgeon 's assistant had my coat off and whipped the shirt over my head before I could down the last of my brandy . " Pretty ! " the surgeon said , looking at my shoulder . " Sweet as a daisy . Very finely cushioned by the deltoid muscle . " He prodded me with a forefinger like a red banana . " Hm ! Hard ! Surprised the splinterdid n't bounce off ! Take out half a pint of blood and he 'll be better than ever ! " He bled me , as I knew he would ; for these navy surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for headache , toothache and footache ; for burns , frostbites , loss of memory and even loss of blood . Whenever they do n't know what to do , they bleed their patients ; and since they seldom know what to do they 're forever bleedingsomeone . Yet I must admit that when he had taken a cupful of blood from my arm I felt relieved . " How 'll he do for dinner ? " Captain Wise asked the surgeon , while the assistant helped me on with my shirt . " Admirably , " the surgeon said . " Ten minutes ' rest and he 'll be fit to eat a sheep ! " He went away with his assistant , wheezing mirthfullylike a porpoise clearing his nose of a vast accumulation of air and water . " Yes , " Captain Wise said , " a bite of dinner 'll do you no harm . It 'll occupy your mind and improve my own . I 've heard monstrous strange tales about Americans , but I 've had few opportunities to speak with them . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for a time on the berth in the small gun-deck cabin in which I was stowed by the captain 's orders , and had freed myself of blood and powder stains and struggled into the clean clothes Tommy Bickford had stuffed in my duffel bag , there was a stiffness in my shoulder ; but the blackness that ' filled my brain after the blowing up of the Lively Lady had fallen away , as the tide falls on our Arundel beaches , though now and again a black wave came out of the recedingtide and lapped at my brain once more , as I suppose must always be the case whenever a tide goes out . THE LIVELY LADY 201p201Sir Arthur and Lady Ransome were in the captain 's cabin when I went to it , and Captain Parker as well ; and I can not deny feeling bitter when I saw how they had become gay and light-hearted and inclined to toss scraps of gaiety to me , whether I wanted them or not . " Ow , Captain , " Sir Arthur said , as I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear , for making you a trifle late for your appointmentat the Island of Jersey . " I smiled as pleasantly as I could . " Jersey ! " Captain Wise exclaimed . " Were n't you getting a little deep in enemy waters ? " Sir Arthur laughed spitefully . " You 'd not have thought so , Captain , if you 'd heard Mr. Nason making free with our Channel , no longer ago than last night ! You 'd have thought the place was full of his friends ! He was talking , even , of blockading Great Britain ! " He stared at me . I looked from him to Lady Ransome and felt a sudden tightness in my breast to see her bend down her head as if to hide the wave of color that mounted suddenly into her face . " I think that was Captain Boyle , " I said . " It 's Captain Boyle who intends to blockade you .. ' Captain Wise made a mildly explosive sound in his throat . " I 've heard of him ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy has heard of him . It was n't Boyle  --  why , by God , sir , of course it was Boyle who squittered around me like a petrel ! So that was Boyle ! I nearly ran off after him when you got under way this morning . Why , I 'd as soon expect to mash a flea with my best bower anchor as catch that gentleman ! " He led the way to the table and , when we were seated , looked at me sharply . " Your brig , now , " he said . " How did she sail with Boyle 's brig ? " " About the same , " I told him . " Under favorable circumstances we did fifteen knots . " He shook his head wonderingly . " I ca n't account for it . Boyle 's vesselwas American built , I take it . " 202 THE LIVELY LADY " Yes . Baltimore built . " " We ca n't build such vessels , " Captain Wise said , " and if we could , we could n't sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you think it possible , Captain , that Americans brag a little faster than they sail ? " Captain Wise studied Sir Arthur carefully . " No , " he said at length , " no , I regret to say that does n't explain it . We 've taken a few of these fast American vessels , but had the devil 's time trying to use ' em . We 're afraid of their long masts , so we shorten ' em . We strengthen the hulls and find we have tubs . " " And may I ask , Captain Wise , " Sir Arthur asked , " whether or not you 've ever been in America ? You appear to display a peculiar tolerance for its people . Ah  --  they shoot birds sitting ! " Captain Wise coughed . " Then I wish to God , sir , they 'd be as thoughtful of us and wait till we sit ! " He turned to me . " You people are different from us on sea , and I 've heard you 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three generations out of England . How do you explain the difference , Captain Nason ? " I think I got red , and I know I spoke foolishly ; for what came upon my tongue were only the stock phrases of our politician orators . " I think it 's the air of liberty we breathe that makes us different . Our fathers won our freedom from British bondage ; we cast off the shackles --  " Suddenly I stopped , remembering in what plight I stood myself at that lamentable moment , and seeing that the others thought it strange I should speak just then of freedom and the casting off of shackles . Captain Wise coughed again ; not even Sir Arthur looked at me , and the air seemed heavy with discomfort . It was Lady Ransome who spoke ; her voice was low , and her eyes hidden by her lashes . " Freedom , " she murmured . " Yes , Americans seem to love freedom ; and what will so many of them do when they 're in our prisons ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was scarcely audible . I stared at the table , unwilling to trust myself to look at her . HerP203husband laughed comfortably . " It 's to be feared , my dear , " he said , " that you 've asked a question Mr. Nason will unfortunately soon be able to answer . Fortunes of war , fortunes of war ! " Lady Ransome did n't look up , and Captain Wise cleared his throat . " I was thinking about your little dog , Captain Nason . Lady Ransome tells me the dog she brought aboard is yours , but is neverthelessEnglish . My thought was this : for a time American prisoners in English prisons were allowed to keep dogs , but there got to be too many of them , and someone gave an order they should all be killed . I 'm afraid there was great lamentation : rather hard on the poor men , because seven hundred of those little comrades of theirs were destroyed on one day . Too bad , too bad ! " He assumed an air of gruffness that deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah  --  since your little dog 's already in Lady Ransome 's custodyand seems happy with her , it might be  --  you know your own business best , of course  --  Sir Arthur being a sportsman  --  ah , I thought it might be well if Sir Arthur could persuade you to  --  ah --  " " I 'd consider it a great honor , " I said , " if Lady Ransome would accept my dog : a great honor and a great relief , for to have him killed would be worse than --  " " No , " Sir Arthur interrupted promptly . " The dog has points ; I 've noticed him , but I should n't want to be indebted . I do n't mind purchasingthe dog for my wife ; but no gifts ! No gifts ! " Lady Ransome looked up ; her hand was at her throat , flat against it , so I could see the little indentations in the smooth skin over her knuckles . Yet the fingers seemed almost to flutter , as if she were about to make a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried , what that impulse would be . " Of course , " I said to Sir Arthur . " However it 's done , it 's a favor to me . Make the price whatever you like . " " Ow ! " Sir Arthur said , " I never make an offer . You make the price , you know : if it 's reasonable , I accept : if not , I wo n't , eh ? " I have no doubt , as I have said , that the man tried always to be just and fair ; yet to my way of thinking he could do and say nothing gracefully . " Would two pounds be too much ? " I asked . " Ow , not in the least , " Sir Arthur said . He drew a wallet from his breast pocket , took out three bits of paper , and tossed them across the table . " I think he 's worth all of three pounds , you know ! " I picked them up and put them in my pocket , unmindful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right , " Captain Wise said , " that 's right . You 'll find use for that before you know it . " There was a knock on the door , and the captain 's polite young secretary entered and bowed . " Land , sir , " he said . " Wembury Point . " " Plymouth ! " Sir Arthur said . " We 're nearly home , eh , Nason ? " At the word " home " I turned to Lady Ransome sharply , as though she had spoken . She was staring full at me , almost haggardly ; and for that moment it seemed to me , strangely , that we were actually speaking to each other , though I could not have said what the words were or even what they meant . Suddenly she sprang up . " Plymouth ? " she cried to Captain Wise , " Plymouth ? But that means  --  Dartmoor ! " " Yes , " he said , and he seemed ill at ease . " I  --  that is  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : you 'll go to the depot at Dartmoor , Captain Nason . " P205THE harbor of Plymouth is cup shaped , with deep green hills rising abruptly from it ; and because of the persistent rain that fell as long as I stayed there , it gave me the feel of a large green funnel that was gathering all the misery in the world and pouring it down my neck . We moved up , in the early morning , past a partly finished breakwaterbetween the sound and the inner harbor ; and I , thinking to myself that I must , if possible , have a final word with Lady Ransomebefore I was taken ashore , set out to go on deck , only to find myself stopped by a red-coated marine on guard at the cabin door . " Captain 's orders , " he said , barring my way with his cutlass . " Prisonersto be took to the berth deck for disembarking . " I backed up and sat on the edge of my bunk , half desperate with disappointment . I had watched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word alone with her , for I could n't forget the little movement of her hand at her throat . It had seemed to me , the more I thought of it , that there was something she wanted to say to me but could n't . Later , half asleep in my berth , I could have sworn I heard her voice in my ear : not a dream voice , but a living voice , saying nothing of importance , but saying it so distinctly that I started up on my matfress , dry throated and my heart pounding fit to push my ribs apart . The marine shuffled his feet outside the door and coughed . " Cap-2o6 THE LIVELY LADYP206tain 's orders , " he repeated . " Prisoners to be took to the berth deck for disembarking . " " Now ? " I asked him . " Yerss , " he said . There was nothing for it but to go , so I picked up my duffel bag and followed him into the bowels of the ship . Our men were peering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hills of Plymouth with a bluish haze . They were guarded by so many marines that I thought there must have been a mutiny , though I soon found this to be the custom of the British where American prisoners were concerned . Tommy Bickford took my bag . " Where we going , Cap'n Dick ? " he asked . Jeddy and ' Lisha Lord pushed up close to hear the answer . When I told them Dartmoor , they blinked , as a dog blinks at a threatened blow . We came to anchor in that portion of the harbor known as Hamoaze , and no time was wasted getting boats into the water and us into them , so that the Granicus might be relieved of the burden of feeding us . As we lay in the boats and cutters , sopping up rain like sponges , I stared and stared at the quarter-deck of the Granicus and at the cabin windows , unwilling to admit I had looked for the last time on the face of Lady Ransome , and her hair like rubbed copper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knew what . But in return for all my staring I saw only rivulets of rain water trickling from the galleries , and an occasional scowling face peering from the after ports . They put us ashore in the drizzle ; and even at this hour in the morning we found ourselves surrounded by drunken sailors out of grogshops , trulls with Voices like knives , old women carrying jugs of ale and baskets full of cakes , fried eels and boiled sheep 's heads ; by Devon farmers in corduroy breeches , red vests that dropped half down their fat thighs , and little tight brimless yellow caps like the scooped-out half of a pumpkin.  |p207Some  pitied us and others did n't . " Look at ' em ! " a trull screamed , pointing at Jeddy and me , " look at ' em , sayin ' they 're Amairicans , when there ai n't nobody as do n't know Amairicans has red skins . " The English sailor with her looked at her gravely , raised her chin with his forefinger , and hit her fair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud . He swayed on his feet , wagging his head at us drunkenly . " Sportsmen ! " he said . " Tha 's what we are ! Treat prisonerslike sportsmen even if they be a lot o ' blasted rebels ! " Our escort of a hundred moon-faced Devonshire militiamen started us off at last , up the steep streets of Plymouth and away from the sour smell and the mud . As we went , Plymouth seemed more than ever like a funnel ; for a piercing wind roared down the abrupt roadways , rain beat into our soggy garments , and brown driblets of water wriggled from foothole to foothole in the claylike mud . I expected , when we reached the top of the hill , to march off on a level to wherever we were going . Yet when we had toiled up we found the top was only the beginning of another range of hills , somewhatless green than those near the ocean ; and when we had labored up the second range we found a third before us , brownish and sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veils of fog . Beyond the third was a fourth , and beyond the fourth , a fifth ; and through all the length of that sullen , interminable day the hills mounted before us , so that the road was like a never-ending river of mud pouring down from some monstrous reservoir high up among the dirty scud of cloud and mist and rain . The color of those hills changed gradually from brown to gray , and then to a dark gray ; so that the country was as somber as it was chill and watery . There were no trees or shrubs on that vast expanse of rolling countryside , and no houses  --  only here and there , at wide intervals , a hut that seemed to shrink into itself at the threatening hills that frowned upon it . As we went higher there were patches of snow , and a biting dampness to the air such as I have never felt on any ocean . We plodded upward all that cold wet morning , and in the after-208 THE LIVELY LADYp208noon we came to the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivinggurry of snow and rain . There were stupendous granite pinnacles and knobs jutting from its dingy surface as though an angry God had pelted it with the leavings from the rest of the world . There was a confused babbling before and behind us , and I caught the word " Dartmoor . " Jeddy pulled at the sleeve of the moon-faced Devonshire militiaman beside us . " Is this Dartmoor ? " The soldier looked at us stolidly . " Dartymoor be oop , " he said thickly . It seemed to us the hill would never end ; but we topped it at last and found ourselves looking off at a country faintly like that through which we had already mounted , and yet unlike it . It was more gigantic , as though we were seeing what we had already passed through , but seeing it magnified and distorted by weariness and hunger , or by a sick man 's dream . The ground before us swept off into a broad valley , and then up to tremendous remote heights , treelessand houseless , and dotted here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in that enormous expanse . The road , empty of all life and unsheltered by any tree or house from the drive of the rain and snow-laden wind , stretched off ahead of us like a dirty string . The valley and the distant hills were almost black , except where snow lay on them ; and what was more , the drab soil around us , when I poked at it with my fingers , was not good clean dirt , but a slimy black peat , unhealthy and decayed . " Dartymoor , " the soldier beside us said , and I thought there was complacency in his voice . Certainly there was pride in the gesture he made with his musket toward the dreadful land that faced us , though how any person could look at it except with horror was beyondme ; for if ever a place looked like an abode for devils and lost souls , it was that swarthy , sinister moor . We were like blind insects , it seemed to me , crawling and crawling up the roof of a great black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature with little exertion and no regret . P209They gave us no rest , these pie-faced Devonshire soldiery , but drove us on , across the somber hills , past up-thrust granite arms that seemed to threaten us ; up and up , and down and down , and up and up again ; and late in the afternoon we came to a wretched square stone house , rising from pools of water in which sad ducks paddled . Beyond it we saw another , and beyond that a bend in the road and a downward path to a shallow , desolate valley where there were more houses . Beyond the houses , sprawled against a dingy bill slope , lay a circularmass of granite ; a sort of giant millstone . We stared at it and stared at it , lurching drunkenly down the slope like mud-caked scarecrows ; but if any man of us had a thought in his head , either fearful or otherwise , about that dark and hulking prison , he kept it to himself . P210HE shape of that miserable place , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millstone or cartwheel . The outer rim of the wheel was a stone wall a mile in length and twelve feet in height ; and thirty feet from it was the inner rim of the wheel : a similar wall , twelve feet in height as well . Around the top of each wall was stretched a wire to which bells were hung , and if any part of the wire was touched , no matter how lightly , the bells set up a clangor ; and every guard in hearing came running with his loaded musket . Projecting from the inner rim at intervals were loopholed bastions ; so when the guards ran into the bastions and up the steps with which they were supplied they could sweep the entire prison yard with their muskets and cut down any person who might be striving to mount the wall . This enormous tilted cartwheel was divided into equal parts by a high stone wall running through its center . On one side of the wall were offices , guardhouses and storehouses . On the other side were the prison buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England barn , but their walls built entirely of stone , and all of them pointing inward to a common center , like clumsy spokes in this vast wheel . The seven buildings were again divided , three being in a yard by themselves on one side of the semicircle , and three in a yard on the other side ; and in between , standing alone and walled off from the three to the right and the three to the left , was the odd prison , Prison Number Four , which was the deepest and darkest in THE LIVELY LADY 211p211the place , barring the Cachot or Black Hole itself ; for it was in NumberFour that those Frenchmen who were known as Romans lived , and King Dick and his court , and all the Americans who had been captured up to this time . The high wall that separated the prison half of the cartwheel from the other half was pierced in the center by a high barred gate  --  and the gate led from the prison half into a market place , a hundred feet square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . We were driven like sheep beneath a stone archway in the outer wall , taken in hand by a detachment of bare-kneed Scotch soldiery , and herded down through the inner gate and into a small stone house that stood on our left , near the hospital . Our clothes were soaked and covered with mud . There was mud in our hair , even ; and some of us could not stand upright because of the blisters on our feet . They wrote our names in a book , giving us numbers : putting down our rank , when we were received , where we were born ; our ages and statures and appearance ; the shape of our faces , the color of our hair and eyes , the marks on our bodies  --  all the things that would help them catch us again in case we escaped . While we stood waiting for this wearisome duty to be completed there was a shouting of sentries outside , and a stir and bustle among the clerks who were taking our names , and with that in came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick upper arms and curly brown hair , dressed in the uniform of a naval officer . This man was Thomas Shortland , captain in the royal navy : agent for prisonersof war at Dartmoor ; and we were not long in discovering what thousands of Americans already knew  --  that if ever a man deserved to burn in hell , it was Thomas Shortland . I was sure , as soon as I looked at him , that he would have a touchy temper ; for this is something , I have found , which often accompanies curly brown hair . " My God ! " Shortland exclaimed angrily to one of the clerks , " what 's Pellew thinking of to send me this number of men ! A hundred of them , and there 's already nine thousand in the prison ! " He212 THE LIVELY LADYp212stamped up and down ; and I knew , from the look of him and the rage he was in , that to attempt to speak with him about getting a parole would be doing all of us a disservice . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he snapped . " Yes , and mess equipment . You , Hawkens : see they get mess equipment , and spun yarn for slinging their hammocks . " They brought us our bedding : a hammock of fair quality , a mattressabout an inch in thickness , stuffed with something that felt like wet wadded newspaper , and a blanket that might have held out wind if it could have been tarred . When the clerks were done with us we shouldered our bedding and limped into the rain , to find our bags waiting . We picked them up , whereupon the Scotch soldiers marched us through still another gate and down across the empty square market place , which would have been the hub of the hulking wheel to which I have likened the prison . We could see the square front of Number Four Prison ahead of us , with dim lights shining from its six end windows : windows that gave it the look of glaring at us out of ancient , rheumy , hating eyes . The soldiers pushed us through iron gates at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led us between two strong walls , up to the face of the building and around a corner to an entranceway . He fumbled at the door , rattling a key in the lock . There was a stale , sour smell around us , in spite of the bitter wind that whipped the raindrops through our sodden garments . When the door creaked open , a volcanic blast of noise and fetid air surged out . " Git along in ! " the warden shouted . " ' Urry up ! Do n't tike the ' ole bloody night ! " I do n't know how I had come to think of Dartmoor as a place of small stone cells in which manacled men lay eternally on the floor , groaning . This was how I had thought of it ; but now that the ironstuddeddoor had closed behind us I saw there were neither cells nor manacles . If there were groanings , they were completely lost in a deafening hubbub of gabbling , laughing and hurrooing , shotP213through with scraps of song , shrill whistlings , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , with colonnades of slender posts extending from floor to ceiling along the length of it , as though hundredsof small schooners , stripped of standing and running rigging , were moored close together , not only along the walls , but down the center of the room as well . Thus it had the look of the most tremendousstable in the world , with stalls for hundreds of horses ; but instead of horses between the masts or posts or stanchions or whatever you wish to call them , there were men squatting around kettles in groups of six , eating , drinking , laughing and shouting ; men sewing at garments , or searching themselves for vermin , or reading in books and newspapers , or playing games , or busy at pursuits that were mysteriesto us . Among them were flickering candles whose yellow beams seemed to make their garments and their faces yellow , but to cast no illumination whatever on the remainder of their prison . Thus the masts or stanchions vanished into the upper murk , and the yellow company was outlined against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till later that I saw the glitter was caused by the reflection of the candles on moisture that trickled unendingly down the face of the dark stones . The pressure Of the men pushed me into an alleyway between the stanchions , an alleyway that ran the length of the building . The men in the stalls , most of them clad in sleazy roundabout jackets , saffron yellow in color and stamped back and front with the black TO TO of the Transport Office , never so much as raised their eyes . We dragged ourselves wearily a little farther down the alley , and then a little farther , helpless and friendless , but ever hopeful of finding a spot where we might squeeze in and rest . It seemed to me that every inch of floor space in this great prison house was occupied , and we doomed to wander through laughing , yelling prisoners until too exhausted to move farther . Yet we were strangely succored , and by one who aimed to persecuteus , as is sometimes the case in this life . Jeddy Tucker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached silently for a gangling , saffron-colored figure hunkered on the floor , searchinghis body for vermin like a yellow monkey . When Jeddy pulled him to his feet , I saw it was Eli Bagley , whom we had last seen heading to the westward in his crazy brig , hopeful , like Columbus , of reaching the American continent . He stared at us open-mouthed for a moment ; then burst into malevolent laughter . " Col durn ye ! " he said to Jeddy , and his wanderinggaze included me as well , " they got ye ! " He was a miserable object , dirty and with no shirt beneath his yellow roundabout jacket ; and when I looked into the stall in which he had been squatting I saw men no more savory-looking than Bagley . He laughed again , excitedly . " I thought you would n't never get took ! By gorry , I wished you was here last winter , when we did n't have no clothes nor fires nor nothing . " " Where can we hang these hammocks ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he squealed , his lantern-jawed face a fiery red , and his chin whisker trembling with rage . Then he grew calmer , as though realizing we were all Americans together . " Well , " he said , scratching himself uncertainly , " well --  " " Go on , Bagley , " Jeddy urged him . " We never did anything to you that you did n't deserve . " " You belong up on the next floor , " he said , peering at us sharply . " All your people are up there . Go on up them steps  --  " he pointed to a long flight of stone stairs opposite the doorway through which we had entered , stairs that ascended into the darkness in which the ceiling was shrouded  --  " and when you 've clumb ' em , ask , for King Dick . " He pressed his nutcracker lips tight together , then doubled over , slapping his knees and cackling . We shouted to the drabbled , mud-smeared men who stood crowded in the alleyway behind us , staring at the tumult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinpoints ofP215countless candles reflected in their eyes . They turned and made their way up the stone stairway , looking , as they mounted that steep slope , bent beneath the burdens of their bags and hammocks , like the picturein the Bible that my mother brought from England in her sailing days  --  the picture showing the building of the Tower of Babel . Jeddy and I climbed the stairs last of all to find our crew huddled close together at the top . I saw there was trouble brewing ; for the huddled men had lowered their bags and hammocks to the floor and were hitching at their trousers and sleeves , as men do when on the verge of using their fists . When we pushed through them and came into the front rank , we saw we were in another vast stable-like room , no different from the one on the lower floor . Similar rows of stanchions extended as far as we could see in the gloom , and candles made innumerable golden points through its dim cavernous length . Yet there was a difference ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell something like that in the den of a fox ; and above all else the , prisoners were different . On the floor below they had paid no attention to us , so that we felt alone and forgotten , and therefore helpless . Here , on the other hand , there were faces turned toward us wherever we looked : thin , mean , pockmarkedfaces that made quick movements , like animals watching in the deep forest , raising and lowering their heads as though to catch our scent . They were ugly faces , gray-looking even in the yellow light of the candles , and gaunt . Some of these unsavory folk were clothed , and badly clothed , in yellow rags or grayish rags ; whereas others wore nothing except pieces of cloth twisted around their loins . It was easy to tell from the look in these men 's eyes that we were n't welcome , and I knew we would do well to get away quickly , since we were in no condition to fight  --  not even to fight naked scarecrows . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is King Dick ? " A voice among these watching faces said something in French . They were all Frenchmen , I saw , and bad ones , too , if it 's possible to tell anything from a man 's face . A squatting , half-naked figure close to us rose on hands and knees . A knife was tucked in his right hand so that the blade extended halfway up his bare gray arm . He snarled at us , using a word I had never heard before . " Shut your mouth ! " Jeddy cried . He threw his clothes bag at the half-naked man , knocking him in a heap . He followed the bag like a cat , dragged the man to his feet and drove a fist into his windpipe , so that he sprawled to the floor and lay there . Jeddy snatched up the knife which the half-naked man had dropped , and recovered the clothes bag at the same time . The rest of the ragged men scrambled upright and glared silently at us . Most of them , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows were to be struck , we had best strike first . The thought had no sooner passed through my head than I heard a shrill , high voice , far away and beyond the circle of snarling French faces , shouting querulously , " Frawg ! Frawg ! Frawg ! " With that the angry Frenchmensank back as if they had been puppets , deserted by their guidinghand . The anger vanished miraculously from their faces , and they cast only occasional glances at us from the corners of their eyes . The distant shout of " Frawg ! " was picked up by other voices , all strangely high . It occurred to me suddenly that these were the voices of Negroes . We became conscious of a bustle not far from us : a scurrying and hustling . Figures approached between the stanchions , one a towering , giant figure . As it came close enough to be lighted by the feeble yellow candlelight , we saw it to be that of a gigantic Negro . He wore a bearskin hat , so that he seemed eight feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long club , like the handle of a boarding pike , but thicker and gnarled . His face was a soft , sooty black , like the black on the bottom of a kettle , and his head seemed too small for his enormous body , rather like a melon balanced on an up-ended long gun . Yet his mouth and eyes made up in size for the smallness of his head ; for his mouth stretched all the way across his face , as though slashed with a knife ; while his eyes , possibly because of their whitenessP217against the sooty black of his skin , had the appearance of china doorknobsset on swivels . On each side of this tremendous man , as he bore down on us with eyes rolling from side to side , were two smaller Negroes : one a scowling , bowlegged , ape-like man in a bright green coat reaching nearly to his heels  --  a personage whom we came to know later as the Bishop ; and the other a worried-looking darky with a peculiar habit of constantlylooking behind him . The worried-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke because he claimed to have been one of the secretaries of the Duke of Kent . The towering black man and his two attendants came to a halt over the Frenchman who had been hit . He still lay where he had fallen , clutching at his throat . " Heah ! " the huge Negro said in a plaintive , light voice , poking the Frenchman with his stick and rolling his eyes over us , " Wha 's goin ' on heah ? Who stirred up all ' is whuppus ? " I took the knife from Jeddy and tossed it beside the Frenchman . " I was told to come up here and ask for King Dick , " I said . " These Frenchmen figured on stopping us . " He stared at me solemnly . " Who ? " he demanded . " Who tole you ? ' At 's me ! Ah 'm King Dick . Ah 'm King up here . Who was it tole you ? " " Bagley , " I said . " Bagley ? Ole Goat-whisker Bagley ? Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' him friends ? " he persisted . Jeddy pushed up to him like an impertinent sparrow . " Friends ! " he exclaimed . " How could we be friends ? We know him too well ! Hell , if he knew how to sail , he 'd captain a slave ship ! " - King Dick peered at him carefully , then dropped his head suddenlyon one side , half closed his eyes , and giggled as though a finger had tickled him . Jeddy laughed , reaching up to slap this black hulk on the shoulder . King Dick gave way to immoderate mirth , opening his mouth until it seemed like a yawning cavern in his face ; while his two henchmen viewed us somberly . His laugh eventually died , and he scanned us again with glittering roaming eyes . " ' Ese Frawgs , " he said , " ' ey doan ' want no moh white folks messin ' up ' is prison ! ' Ey was fus ' heah , an ' ' ey get snippety when ' ey 's crowded . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkered over mysterious pursuits . " You Frawgs " he shouted at them , " you keep ' em stickers away fum mah sight , or you 'll get youahsefs into a buckus ' at no Frawg ai n't never seen nothin ' like ! " He turned and waved his club over us benevolently . " Come on , you white folks , " he said . " ' Scuse rnah delay , but we been havin ' trouble wif ouch society in ' is place , so we gettin ' picky an ' choosy ! " P 2191 HAVE the vaguest of recollections of my first night in Dartmoor Prison ; because when I was sure my men would have food and a place to sleep , I seemed to move in an ever thickening haze of drowness , a haze that pressed against me as heavily , almost , as water ; d when my head dipped beneath its surface , as it often seemed to do , I knew nothing , though it appeared I was able to walk and talk and even eat a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coming among more black men than I had ever seen together except in the West Indies . Above all else I remember the tumult ; for none of these prisoners were sitting quietly , but were engaged in trades and traffickings , tending small shops , crying their wares , peddling their products , crowding around gamingtables , or operating miniature restaurants and coffee stalls . All of them , black or white , perpetually watched the movements of King Dick , so there was no doubt about the high position he held . He led us to the rear of the building , where one of the stalls between the stanchions had been set off from the others with strips of canvas . In this stall was a large armchair , its frame brightly gilded and its back and seat upholstered in red plush . Before it was a table at which sat two white boys dressed neatly in blue roundabout Jackets , duck trousers , and varnished black hats . King Dick took Jeddy and me into the stall with him , the Bishop and the Duke entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , unless he sent them on errands they were always trailing him220 THE LIVELY LADYp220like a double shadow cast by two strong lamps . As soon as he entered , the boys leaped to attention . They , he carelessly explained , were his seckataries . He threw himself on his red plush throne . " Heah you , Namiah ! " he said to one of the seckataries , " you go git Jesus Fenton an ' Pigtail an ' Goose Huck an ' Ayun-Haid . I want ' ose boys come a-flyin ' ! " Namiah darted away . " You , Albert , " he said to the other , " you go tell Chickenfoot he doan ' sell no more beer , seppen to mah frien 's , ' nen git ' at plum gudgeon man an'at lobscouse man an " at freco man , an ' tell ' em I say come a-runnin ' wif ev'y las ' scrap in ' eir kids . " He nodded and winked at us as Albert hurried off on his errand . " Ai n't nobody sells no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had the proud , aloof look of the man who has reached a position of affluence and power and is telling how he did it . " You lemme ' lone in ' is prison long enough , " he said confidently , " ' an I 'll buy it right off ' ose English white folks . " Negroes , singly and in pairs , pushed up to the opening in the front of King Dick 's stall to stare at us with glistening eyes . King Dick rapped the cement floor sharply with his gnarled stick . " You , Jesus , " he said to a pale Negro with thin lips and a Spanish look about him , " you git on up in ' at cock loft an ' tell ' ose Frawgs in mah boxin ' ' cademy Ah needs ' at space to-night . You tell ' em not to make no muckus ' bout it , lessen ' ey lookin ' to git sent to Plymuff wif ' ose odder Romans . " He explained the matter to us quickly .

" You , Ayun-Haid , " he continued , turning back to his henchmen and addressing a Negro whose close-cropped skull had a hard , metalliclook to it , " you cut out sixty of ' ese new white folks an ' take ' emP221up into mah ' cademy in ' at cock loft an ' show ' em where ' ey hang ' ose hammicks . You an ' Jesus stay wif ' em . You h-eah me ? You stay wif ' em , an ' doan ' go ' way till ' em hammicks is all hung , lessen you want mah Rs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stick at Iron-Head , who at once scurried among our men , gathering his flock together . King Dick rose from his throne and addressed them tersely and to the point . Even in my half-conscious state I could feel , in this enormous , smiling Negro , an air of assurance and authority that would have done credit to the quarter-deck of a 74-gun ship . " ' Ey 's close to ' leven hund'ed men in ' is Number Foh Prison , " he said , " an ' room foh ' bout th'ee hund'ed ; so you do like Ah tell you , else you wo n't fin ' no place to hang yo ' hammicks , not a-tall . Ah 's King in ' is Number Foh , an ' Ah likes good white folks ; but bad white folks , Ah takes an ' bends ' eir jaws roun ' into ' eir eahs ! You go ' long up , an ' Ah 'll sen ' up somepin foh you to chew on . " Seating himself , he went on with his orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the center stalls on the second floor and bid him sling his hammock under the beams at the side of the building ; then to empty six stalls entirely and scatter the occupantsamong the places made vacant by the single removals ; or-dersalso to Pigtail to follow Goose Huck and instantly report any insubordination on the part of the Frenchmen . " ' Em 's mah odors ! " he reminded Goose and Pigtail . " You tell ' em Frawgs Ah would n't do it , seppen it 's got ta be done , an ' if ' ey make huckuss ' bout it --  " He pushed out his tremendous black fist , then flicked it forward , twisting it as he did so , and somehow it had the look of a projectile that would pierce six inches of oak plank . It was about then that my senses began to slip from me for a minuteat a time . In no way could I keep my ears or eyes open . I heard King Dick 's voice saying , " Heah , white boy , bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what became of the plum gudgeon I would never have known if Jeddy had not told me , when he roused me on the following morning , that I had swallowed it in my sleep . King Dick himself , Jeddy said , had peeled off my coat , found my shoulder swollen , andp222so had slung my hammock in his own stall , lifting me in his arms and placing me in it as easily as though I had been five feet tall and no bigger than Emily Ransome . Jeddy shook his head as he stood peering into my hammock . " What beats me , " he said , " is the stuff this black elephant knows . I was going to call Jotham Carr to doctor your shoulder ; but the King said no . He got out a chicken bone and a feather and a piece of horsehair . Then he tied the feather onto the bone with the hair and stuck it under your shoulder and said it would be all right in the morning . How does it feel ? You ca n't cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " I looked at my shoulder . The soreness was gone from it , and there was a ragged shred of cloth protruding from the puncture where the splinter had entered . After I had drawn it out , the wound looked no worse than a flea bite . " Well , " I said , " he took a shine to both of us , and a good thing he did ! " King Dick came hastily into the stall while I was donning my stilldampclothes . " Slip yo ' cable ! " he said in his plaintive , high-pitched voice , slapping his black paws together with a smack like a longboat coming down with a run on still water . " Git yo'se'f six white folks togevver foh yo ' mess , ' nen go ' long down an ' git raidy to count out in messes . New men come in , prisoners allus count out . " Our mess of six included Tommy Bickford , ' Lisha Lord , Jotham Carr , and John Cromwell . We joined the throng in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there a while , jammed in with a thousand filthy Frenchmen , Negroes , and ragged , starved-looking Americans , the doors were opened , and we filed into the rain-swept prison yard . Every sixth man got the number of his mess on a ticket , and the ticket holder , in turn , received a day 's rations for his mess from the prison cooks  --  two loaves of brown bread , a chunk of beef weighing three pounds , including bone and gristle , and a handful of vegetables . Number Four Prison had looked evil enough the night before , withp223its pale eyes glaring through the rain ; but in the gray light of early morning its appearance put a weight like an eighteen-pound shot in the pit of my stomach . Some of the feeling may have been caused by the sour stench of the half-naked Frenchmen who slunk through the crowded yard in twos and threes . Some , certainly , was due to the perpetual drizzle of cold rain , and the barren hills we dimly saw beyond the outer walls  --  hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I was oppressed by the granite barriers that hemmed us in ; for I now perceived that the reality of escaping over those toweringwalls would take more study than I had ever given any problem in navigation . We had been in the yard less than five minutes when Jeddy spied a man with whom he had drunk a pitcher of ale at the Ship Inn in Salem when we went there to buy the North River sloop that became the Lively Lady ; and in three seconds he had his arm across this man 's shoulder , the man 's name being Josiah Pettengell , a master 's mate ; and the two of them were as thick together as though they had married sisters . Because of this we were soon surrounded by a dozen Salem men , a few in decent coats and breeches such as we ourselves wore , but most of them in strange saffron-colored roundabout jackets and trousers , marked with the broad arrow and the letters T. O. The jackets and trousers were undersized , as if made for children , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads dubiously when told how King Dick had found us places to sleep . " You want to watch them blacks , " Pettengell said ; " they 'll steal the nails out of your shoes if you ai n't careful . They was scattered all over the building when we first come here ; but they got to stealingso much , they was put all together up on the second floor . " " I notice the stealin ' ai n't stopped , " one of the Salem men said . " Them niggers was awful handy to blame anything onto . " " They treated us all right , " I told Pettengell . " Maybe they think you got money , " he said , " and aim to gamble it out of you . You better move down with us as soon as some of our Frenchmen die off . They die off pretty fast . " " Well , " I said , " for a while we 'll stay where we are . What 's the matter with those Frenchmen up on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their shoulders , as men do when asked for information on odious topics . " They 're the fellers that took the place of the Romans , " Pettengell said . " Give ' em time and they 'll be Romans . " He spat on the ground . The others followed his example . " What 's a Roman ? " I asked , having wondered about it since hearingKing Dick mention them . " Bad Frenchmen , " Pettengell said . " Bad ! By God , we do n't know nothing about being bad , alongside those fellers . I 've shipped with tough ones , but I never see nothing like those Romans . They never wore no clothes . " " At night , you mean ? " I asked . " Hell ! " said one of the Salem men , " not never ! " " They 'd freeze , " I protested . They laughed . " Look , " Pettengell said , " they was as hard all over as the sole of my foot from sleeping on stone floors without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep warm . They rolled over on orders , all together , and never got took sick . They never had nothing the matter with ' em . " " No smallpox even , " one of the others said . " Hell , " someone said , " that was because they 'd all had it before they was weaned . " " No , it wa' n't , " Pettengell said . " They never got typhus , nor colds , either . They was the healthiest folks ever I see , and the worst . " " Murder , you mean ? " Jeddy asked . " Murder ! " Pettengell said . " Murder wa' n't nothing ! By God ! " he made a hissing sound , expressive of disgust , and the others growled assent . " You would n't believe it , " Pettengell said . " There ai n't nothing in the world as bad and dirty as a bad Frenchman , and the percentage of bad ones is awful high . " P225The others told what they had seen these Frenchmen doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quake like a shivered topsail . " What 's the chance of escaping ? " I asked , " or do n't you ever think about it ? " " Escaping ! " Pettengell said . " We do n't think about nothing else ! Listen ! " He tapped me on the chest . " Until last month we ai n't had anything in here . We ai n't had anything ! Nobody had no money . Most of us did n't have no clothes , only the rags we wore when we was took . The British would n't give us clothes . Our own government would n't send us clothes . Our own government would n't send money . You heard about Beasley yet ? " I said I had n't . " Reuben G. Beasley ? " Pettengell persisted . " Ai n't you never heard the name Reuben G. Beasley ? " We shook our heads . Pettengell 's lip drew up like an angry dog 's . " Reuben G. Beasley , " he said , " is American agent for prisoners of war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we was dying off like flies with smallpox , he came up here and would n't see but one of us for fear of catching it himself . Stood and talked to one man out of all our hundreds , holding a perfumed handkerchief to his nose , and saying , Oh , mercy ! What a confounded stench ! " ' Pettengell made his voice high and lisping , like a silly woman 's . " That 's the only time he ever come to Dartmoor ; and him the American agent ! When we wrote that we were starving and freezing and herded in with Frenchmen out of cesspools , he never answered our letters . When we had to lay on the stone floors of this prison with typhus and pneumonia , Beasley let us lay and die . " He eyed us furiously , and we stared back at him , wondering if it could be true . " Well , " he went on , " that 's why we ai n't made any escapes . It wa' n't till last month we got clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner 's allowance : five half pennies a day .   We 're rich now . Two and ahalf pennies a day , we get : nigh onto seven shillings every four weeks . We can buy tools . We can keep shops and make money . We can have a quid of tobacco every day or two . Give us time and we 'll show you some escapes ! " There was a movement among the prisoners in our section of the yard , and I noticed there were fewer than when we had come out . Pettengell looked around . " Market 's open ! " he said ; and with that he and his yellow-clad companions hastened away . Jeddy laughed defiantly . " Well , " he said , " that sounds pleasant , do n't it ! " I left him to prowl among the French , well aware that in a short time he would know near everybody and everything worth knowing , and went back myself into Prison Number Four to see King Dick , as I had been told to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prison house that work was no hardship to them , but a Godsend . The hammockshad been triced up against the stanchions , setting off each stall or bay from the one beside it ; and in nearly every bay was  --  a group of men at work : three or four , and sometimes even the full population of the bay , which was six . From the seriousness and diligence with which they labored , they might have been making jewehy or tapestries that would bring them thousands of dollars in wages : yet the majority were cutting soup bones into small pieces that would serve as planks in the fashioning of ship models  --  models that might take six months in the making . Some were plaiting straw into baskets and boxes ; others were manufacturinglobscouse and plum gudgeons in kettles over small stoves . The first and second floors , however , were quiet by comparison with the third ; for thw gambling tables on the third floor were alreadyopen , and the vendors of coffee and tea were shouting their wares . At the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in ragged drum-beats and wailing discords ; and in another quarter Negroes rehearsed a play that had a sound of Shakespeare , but a Shakespeare grandly mangled.  |p227I  found King Dick holding court in the space which , I learned , he had reserved as a boxing academy ; for he taught boxing when free of his royal duties . He was seated on a green-topped table that I was to know later as the Bishop 's altar on Sunday , the royal judgment seat on weekday mornings , and a Wheel-of-Fortune table during afternoons and evenings . On one side of him was the Duke and on the other the Bishop , both glowering darkly at an abashed Negro who stood before King Dick . There was something of a crowd in attendance , mostly black men ; while stretched on the floor at the outer edge of the crowd was a Frenchman in a soiled yellow TransportOffice suit . As I came up , the Frenchman struggled to a sitting position and felt his jaw in a gingerly manner , moving it from side to side as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro in the chest with his stick . " Ah give you warnin ' two weeks back , Ashmodeus Jones , " he said , in a high , almost breathless voice . " Ah tol ' you not come pussuckin ' aroun ' nat ' t'eater wif so much beer in yo ' stummick . Din ' Ah tell you , Ashmodeus ? " The eyes of Ashmodeus rolled spasmodically in search of succor . He was manifestly unable to answer . " Tha 's what Ah done , " the King went on , prodding the culprit with his staff , " an ' how you foller mah odors ? Ah had a complaint las ' night fum Clerphus Lapp ' at when he was a-mekkin ' a speech to Ot'ello , playin ' he was Des'emona , an ' all painted nice an ' white , you was a-sittin ' in nat t'eater wif anodder stummick-full of beer , jes ' awfuldrunk , an ' bus ' right out a-laffin ' an ' a-laffin ' so 's he 's ' bilged quit bein ' Des'emona an ' holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you done ! " " Ah wa' n't drunk , " said the culprit feebly . " Ah s'pose , " the King said , in a faint , reedy , skeptical voice , " Ah s'pose you din ' have no beer a-tall ? Ah s'pose not ! " He flapped one huge flat foot against the door , in time with the ragged drum-beats of the Negro band. 228 THE LIVELY LADY " Nuh-nuh-nuh , Ah had two li'l ' mugs , " Ashmodeus said fearfully . " Ai n't nobody goin ' git drunk on two mugs beer . " King Dick rapped his gnarled stick on the floor . " ' At 's what you say , Ashmodeus ! ' At 's what ev'y drunk man say . Nex ' time you see someone git drunk for th'ee-foh days , you ast him how much he put into hisse'f , an ' he say he had a glass or two  --  jes ' two li'l ' glasses ! ' At 's what he 'll say ! Hyuh , hyuh , hyuh ! " He laughed darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , else you would n't go lussuckin ' aroun ' nat t'eater , yellerin ' an ' bellerin ' when Des'emona right in a purty speech . ' At 's what Ah say ! ' At 's judgment nis co't ! " " Amen ! " said the Bishop in his deep , booming voice . " Judgment nis co't , " the King went on , rising to his feet and adjustinghis enormous bearskin hat upon his small head , " is ' at you git yo ' jaw wiped . Nen you keep away fum ' at beer an ' outen nat t'eater lessen you want git wiped th'ee-foh times , all togedder . " The eyes of the waiting audience widened expectantly . Ashmodeuslooked over his shoulder like a hunted animal , saw no way of escape , and sought to hide his face behind his arms . King Dick made a quick movement with his huge left fist , a movement that caused Ashmodeus to jerk his hands convulsively toward his stomach , as if to protect it . With that King Dick 's vast torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a short distance . Ashmodeus 's head snapped back . His body became rigid and elongated . He seemed to float upward from the floor , as though drawn by a wire , and in the next instant he fell with a lummocky thud on the cement-covered floor , jerked his right knee weakly , and lay still . " Co't 's adjourned ! " King Dick said . He turned indifferently from his admirers , leaving them to dispose of the insensible Ashmodeus in any way that suited , them , and came to me . " Wheah 's ' at li'l ' Feevolus ? " he asked . " Jeddy ? " I asked . " He went around looking for someone he knew . What 's a feevolus ? " " Li'l ' bird , " King Dick said faintly , yet shrilly , making what he may have considered a bird-like motion with his tremendous big hand .   " Li'l ' pickety bird , li'l ' quickety pickety bird . " He flirted his hand vaguely and led me down the center of this long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a dank and gloomy cave ; brighter even than the second floor ; but there were pools of water on the cement underfoot , showing that the roof leaked . There were stanchions in sections of it , as on the other floors , except at the two ends , which were airy open halls . At one end I could see a rough stage  --  doubtless the theater where Clerphus Lapp , painted white to represent Desdemona , had been enraged by the drunken laughter of Ashmodeus Jones . At the other end , toward which King Dick was leading me , were tables encircled by prisoners both black and white . As we came closer , my ears told me that the white patrons of the tables were French as well as Americans . The tables were arranged in a rough circle , in the center of which were two barrels of beer on wooden trestles , and two smiling black men waiting for customers . From the players rose a shrill and perpetualgabble , an occasional bellow of " Keno ! " and a peculiar earpiercingshriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Rit ! " All this uproar , somehow , seemed a fitting accompaniment to the wailing d L cords of the black musicians . King Dick signaled imperiously to one of the beer guardians , who ran out from behind his trestle . " Gim us ' ose stools , Shellac , " he said . He beamed on me engagingly . " Had yo ' breakfas ' ? " he asked . When I shook my head he added to Shellac : " Gim us ' ose stools , ' nen tell ' at Gawge Washington Dinwiddie bring ' ose fritters ovah heah , ' nen bring us- two mugs ' at beer an ' wipe ' at foam off ' em . Ah doan ' wan ' no foam ' is mawnin ' or any odder mawnin ' , you heah me , Shellac ? " " Yarsuh ! " Shellac said . He shuffled rapidly away , to return immediately with two rough stools and two brimming mugs of beer . We were approached by a small , bowlegged Negro , shrieking at the top of his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that filled his tray . His monkey face was distorted by strange twitchings result- ing from the trilling half scream , half whistle with which he cried his wares , " Frrrrrit ! Frrrrrit ! Git yo ' frrrrrits ! " King Dick rapped the feet of the fritter vendor with his gnarled stick and eyed him severely . " Heah , Dinwiddie ! Doan ' mek all ' at noise when you see me talkin ' business wif a frien ' ! Ah kai n't think about nuffin ' wif all ' at whussickin ' goin ' on ! " He reached forward , engulfing a dozen fritters in his gigantic hand . " He'p yo'se'f , " he said to me . " Ah got credit wif Dinwiddie . " Dinwiddie smiled a weak , monkey-like smile ; and when I had taken four of the fritters he tiptoedaway , a withdrawn look about his rump , as though fearing to be called back . King Dick stared at me out of , doorknob eyes , popped two fritters into his cavern of a mouth , and washed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mek frien 's easy , " he said at length . " Less you meks , less you loses . " He studied his beer mug thoughtfully . " Ah heahs what you done to ' at ole Bagley ; an ' Ah heahs ' at li ' 1 ' boy Tommy call you Cap'n Dick . Ah doan ' like Bagley ; an ' Dick 's mah name , too ; so Ah guess Ah 's oblessickated to be frien 's wif you . " " Well , " I said , " we need a friend , God knows . " He nodded solemnly . " ' At li'l ' Feevolus , he tol ' me you figgerin ' on gittin ' out ' is ole prison . " " I 've got to get out ! " He closed his eyes wearily . " Whuffoh you want to be like all ' ose white Americans ? Allus pussuckin ' roun ' bout gittin ' out ! Why n't you hol ' yo ' tongue an ' be good white boy ? " He washed down two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed . " Mah lan ' ! Ah guess Ah doan ' ! Ah 's mekkin ' money , an ' Ah 's keeping odor in ' is ole prison . " " Keeping what ? " " Odor , " he said , chewing his fritters . " Wif mah club an ' mah fis ' . You seen me keepin ' odor jes ' now . ' Ese prison folks , Cap'n Shoatlandp231an " em , ' ey 's obleeged to me foh keepin ' odor , an ' if Ah wants to git out , Ah gits out .

" He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mm , mm ! " he said . " Kin you hit ? " I said I could hit as much as was necessary to keep a brig in order . " Stan ' up , " he said , " an ' take a whup at mah chin . " He rose to hisfeet , " a towering , smiling figure , and held out his chin invitingly . " What for ? " I asked . " Ah want to see kin you hit , " he said , and I saw he meant it . " Hit hand as you kin . Ah ai n't goin ' to feel it . " I took him at his word and drove my fist at his velvety black jaw . To my surprise it slipped out from under the blow , so that I missed and nearly lost my balance , though I felt my knuckles graze his cheek . He caught me with an arm like a jib boom when I staggered forward . " Mm , mm ! " he said in a hushed , faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go lashin ' out wif yo ' right fis ' , you ai n't never goin ' get nowheres . " He stared at me thoughtfully , caressing his cheek with fingers the size of marlinspikes . " Heah !

How you lak Ah learn you how to hit , ' nen you be king in anodder prison when ' ey all filled up wif Americans ? " " I would n't do it if I could , " I told him . " I do n't want anything except to get out . " " Ah show you plenty ways mek money , " he said hopefully . " I 've got some . " He nodded , tapping his stick on the floor . " Yarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuffin ' about it . Ah doan ' know nuffin ' about you escapin ' , but effen Ah heahs somepin ' , Ah tells you or ' at li'l ' Feevolus . " He popped the last of his fritters into his mouth and upended his beer mug against his broad , flat nose . " You talk French ? " he asked me then , and I suspicioned from the restlessness of his doorknob eyes that he had a reason for asking . " A little . " " ' At ai n't enuff , " he said , and I was sure , then , he knew-something he was unwilling or unable to tell me . He studied the narrow skylight that stretched the entire length of the slant-roofed cock loft in which we sat . " Ai n't no use not wukkin ' in ' is ole prison , " he said at length . " Folks ' at does nuffin ' , ' ey goes bad . Frawgs , ' ey git to be Romans . Americans , ' ey git to be Rough Alleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yarse , " he said . " Rough Alleys . Fellers ' at wo n't wuk an ' wo n't keep ' eyse'fs clean , on'y gamble an ' steal an ' go mussuckin ' aroun ' mekkin trouble . " " Why do they call ' em Rough Alleys ? " I asked . " ' Cause ' at 's what ' ey are , " he said . " Rough , an ' belong in alleys . " Not until later , when I knew more French , did I discover that the Rough Alleys , who caused such grief among us before we were finished with Day tinoor , got their name from the French word ra f. f ales , a term applied by French prisoners on English prison ships to those among them unfit in dress , person , and manners to associate with folk who made any pretense to decency . " Why n't you start wukkin ' on French ? " King Dick continued . " ' At ole Gin'ral Le Feeber , ovah in Prison Number Sem , he give lessons in French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yockety , ? ockety , yockety , lak mos ' Frawgs . " " Number Seven ? " I asked , to make sure . " Yarse ; Sem , " he said . He warned particularly against gambling , declaring it was a curse , not only to his old Number Foh , but to all the other prisons as well , P233inasmuch as prisoners who became addicted to gambling would sell their clothes and even their daily food ration in order to gamble . I asked him how they lived if they sold their food rations . " ' Ey picks up ' at ole swill behine ' ose cookhouses , ' he explained . " Doan ' you gamble , an ' doan ' you let none of yo ' white boys git started , not lessen you want to see ' em runnin ' aroun ' wifout no shirt nor nuffin ' . " Keno , he said , was not particularly bad , but Faro and the Wheel of Fortune , which he said the Frawgs called Roulette , were sure poison . " If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why have ' em ? You could drive them out if you wanted to , being King . " He let his head sink on his shoulder and giggled weakly . " Whuffoh I wan ' do ' at ? " he asked . " You ai n't seen ' em Frawgs ovah in ' em odder six prisons ! ' Ey 'd tek money offen a li'l ' baby what hadn ' had nuffin ' to eat foh a week !

" A shrill outcry rose from a near-by table . " Lookit ' at ! " King Dick said . " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table , his bearskin hat towering above the excited players . " ' At ai n't nobody 's fault on'y you n ! " I heard him shout . " Effen you goin ' gamble in heah , do yo ' gamblin ' wifout no hussuckin ' ! " He drew two yellow-clad figures from the milling throng and made what looked to me like gentle jabs at them , jabs that traveled about six inches . Yet both gamblers bounced from his keg-like fists : bounced , fell violently to the floor and lay still . There was , I could see , much to be learned about Dartmoor Prison ; and as I hobbled down to our bay on the second floor I thought to myself I would have plenty of time in which to learn it . P234WHAT it was about our life in Dartmoor that weighed heaviest on us , I find it hard to say . At one time I think it was the stench of the place  --  the bitter-sweet , flat , choking odor of unwashed ' bodies and fragments of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scoured daily , others were given only a hasty sweeping  --  what Arundelhousewives call a lick and a promise . Again I think it was the cold ; for the windows had no shutters , only iron bars , so that the bitter winds , the daily rains and snows , and the penetrating fogs that curse Dartmoor for nine months in every year poured in on us day and night . At other times I think it was our despairing rage at the wrongs inflicted on us by our jailers  --  inflicted not because we had committed crimes , but because we had fought to protect our country and our homes from conquest . It may have been the lack of certainty as to our fate : we ' might , for all we knew , be kept in this dripping stone tomb for the remainder of our lives , unless we could escape ; nor was this a groundless fear ; for on every side of us were Frenchmen who had rotted either in the hulks or in Dartmoor for eleven long years , forgotten and forsakenby their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the myriads of fleas that lurked in cracks of the floor or folds of our hammocks , creeping out in the night to raise rows of welts on our bodies , welts that kept us awake and in torment with their burning and itching . Lice I do n't mind . They are clumsy slow creatures , and any man who takes the time and trouble to bep235clean can keep them from his clothes and often escape them entirely . Fleas are different . They are too quick to be easily caught , and cleanlinessis no guard against them . It may have been the threat of disease  --  of smallpox , pneumonia and typhus  --  that hung over us constantly ; or the clamminess that soaked up into us from the reeking floors ; or the manner in which our wardens and guards taunted and jeered us . God knows they got back more taunts and jeers from the Americans in five minutes than their thick British wits could think up in five days , but none the less we brooded over their lying tales of American defeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and wondered and wondered whether , when we returned to our homes , we would be doomed to spend the rest of our lives paying taxes to keep a halfwittedprince regent in women , liquor , and gambling funds . In our own prison and the other six , prisoners had set up schools for the teaching of every subject under the sun . There were classes in navigation , knitting , tailoring , barbering , fencing , dancing , French , German , Spanish ; in cooking , mathematics , boxing , painting , wood carving , Latin , Greek , chess playing , and the use of the globes ; in gambling , even , and theology and violin playing . I can not remember all the things taught in Dartmoor ; but for the expenditure of a penny an hour I truly believe a man could have instruction in any known subject , so that the prison was as good as a university , provided a man was hearty in his desire for knowledge . And to a man who lacks that desire , no university is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Gin'ral Le Feeber proved to be General Le Febvre , an officer who had served with General Rochambeau in the French expedition to Santo Domingo . Like many other French officers , he was no longer admitted to parole , because of the frequency with which his paroles had already been broken.  | He was a tall , thin man , and under his eyes were dark pouches that seemed to match in shape the enormous drooping mustaches that curved down like sickles on each side of his mouth . He had strange ideas , telling in one breath how he had broken his parole , and in the next speaking of his honor , eagle eyed and fierce ; then caressing his mustache and boasting how he had got three girls with child during his stay in the parole town of Wincanton . Yet I liked him . He seemed not only kind , but even honorable , as that term is understood by most . I am sure I could have left money with him and had no penny of it touched , unless he was starving ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted his sword in behalf of any Bourbon king , though he would have marched alone with Bonaparte against all the cannon in the world . He made us welcome when we told him why we had come , and stood proudly before us , a huge cocked hat on his head , and holdingunder his arm , pressed against his coat of fine black broadcloth , a cane made of bone rings fastened together and polished . " Yes , " he said , speaking English well enough , " this king of yours , this king of Number Four , he is not appreciate ' . There is nothing like him . He is a leader ; and like all leaders , he finds out the affairs , both great and small , and places them together , do you understand , to discover the cause  --  the drift  --  the pattern . Perhaps he has told you something new , this king ? " We watched him silently , because we knew nothing , except that King Dick must have had a reason for sending us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows nothing , " he said , " but I feel here  --  " he struck his breast with his clenched hand  --  " that things in France are bad  --  bad ! Yet if things are bad in France there may be a wind to blow good to us , eh ? " He pulled at his sickleshapedmustaches and peered at us sharply . He rolled an eye toward the next bay , where two Frenchmen were playing chess with a set of bone chessmen ; then glanced up at the barred window overhead , through which the Dartmoor fog drifted in wisps that vanished at once in the gloom of the prison .   " You desire to speak French , eh ? " he said finally . " Whence does it spring , this desire ? " " King Dick put it in my head , " I told him . " He told me to learn French so to keep myself busy . " His eyes seemed to search the air above and beside me ; and as they moved from point to point , they swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At length he smiled . " Yes , " he said , " I teach you all the French you need . You find my French very useful ; useful , but expensive . Maybe you find it cost too expensive . " " How much does it cost ? " " Five pounds each man . " There was something here I could not understand ; but I sensed that this general , like King Dick , knew something we did n't . He had something to sell , and we could n't afford to go without it . " Five pounds ! " Jeddy exclaimed . " I got some French already ! I could n't use more than a shilling 's worth . " " Five pounds is all right , " I told the general . " Five pounds apiece . When do we start ? " The general smiled grimly at Jeddy . " Truly ! " he said . " Say me some French , so I see about your accent . " " Well , " Jeddy said , " I speak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand , but it takes me in and takes me out . " Hr cleared his throat , stared round-eyed at the general , and spoke up boldly : " Mon Dieu , mon general , commez vous portez vous ? Il est tres mechant aujourdui , n'est pas ; it fait plouit tout le temps . " The general seized his head in both hands and rocked it . The face of one of the chess players appeared suddenly around the canvas screen that separated the bay where we stood from the next , stared blankly at Jeddy , and withdrew as suddenly as it had appeared . " Dear sweet mother of God ! " the general said . " Il fait plouitl Il est tres mechant aujourdui ! What horror ! If this is the true Nantes French , then I know at last why the citizens of Nantes were treatedP238so badly in the Revolution . Il fait plouitl Ah , my God ! My God ! " " What 's wrong with it ? " Jeddy asked . " As well ask what is wrong with England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ! The gouvernment , the people , the prisons , the houses , the women , the dress , the speech  --  all , all is wrong . So it is with your French . " He turned to me . " You speak the pure Nantes French also ? Speak something to me , so I know the worst . " " Mine 's canal French , " I told him ; and with that , speaking stiffly , since I have never felt free in foreign languages , I said : " Je vois depart de cette prison ici . " The general glared at me , breathing heavily through his nose . He drew a folded silk handkerchief from his breast pocket , flung it open , enveloping us in a wave of violent perfume , and dabbed at his brow . " Look now , " he said , when he had folded most of the odor back into the handkerchief and placed it in his bosom again , " you are strange people , you Americans , laughing and mocking at all things , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fear others will mock you . Therefore you do not speak easily . " ' ) " General , " Jeddy said , touching him lightly on the chest with the backs of his fingers , " with a quart of brandy in me I can say anything in French . " " But certainly ! " the general cried , flicking Jeddy 's chest with his finger tips in turn ; " the stiffness is relaxed by the brandy . For a momentyou forget yourself ! That is the truth. , Therefore we find a way to make you forget yourself so that you speak easily , even without the use of brandy , eh ? " There were chairs in the general 's bay : chairs and a chest ; and attached to stanchions were two paintings , one of a naked woman and one of a woman not quite naked , but almost , so that the place had quite an air . The general drew our chairs close together . " You know how we do this ? " he went on . " We make you become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here to study with me . You become French persons  --  new persons . Thus youP239forget yourselves and your fear of being mocked , and talk like Frenchmen , waving the hands , raising the eyebrow , lifting the shoulder , curling the lip . You see ? Ha , ha ! " He bunched his fingers , kissed their tips , and tossed the kiss toward the picture of the almost naked woman . The thing seemed reasonable . At least there could be no harm in trying it ; so I nodded . " Good ! " the general said . " We start this minute . " He tapped meon the chest . " You are Jean Marie Claude Decourbes . " He repeated the name slowly , raising his shoulders and opening his eyes wide , so at he had a look of almost childish innocence . " Jean Marie Claude ecourbes . Mais oui ! " He leaned forward and stared searchingly at e . " Who are you ? " " Jean Marie Claude Decourbes ! " IIe shook his head . " Shoulder ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are surprised I ask you ! Everybody know you are Jean Marie laude Decourbes  --  " his voice rolled sonorously  --  " enseigne de vais  --  aude la Marine Imperiale de France ! Raise the shoulder ! Use the ce ! That is what a face is for  --  to show what passes behind it . You oop the eyelid and raise the chin one sixteenth inch : you are insultbecause the name is not known . You raise one eyebrow : you are tient with an ignorant man . You raise two eyebrows : you are surprisedan intelligent man should not know . You see ? Use the face ! by did God give you the face ? Not to be blank toward all the world , like the sheep or the goat , heir. ? But to speak silently to men of things that can not at the moment be said in words ! To mis-d the enemy ! Very good ! Who are you ? " I drew down my mouth and raised my eyebrows . " Jean Marie laude Decourbes , " I protested . " Damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast pocket the general drew out a small mirror . He cached on it , wiped it on his sleeve , examined his face in it first one side and then on the other ; then handed it to me . " Look in s and say to yourself one hundred times who you are . Jean Marie Claude Decourbes , a seaman of Provence . Never forget . You are Jean Marie Claude Decourbes ! " He turned to Jeddy . " Give attention , small one ! You are Felix Berthot , Capitaine du navire Ma Mie de Nantes . Who are you ? " Jeddy lifted his shoulders until his head seemed almost to sink beneath their level , drew up his eyebrows and splayed out his hands . " Felix Berthot ! " he plaintively declared , and anybody with half an eye could see from his gesture that he considered the general both rude and ignorant for asking . The general rubbed his hands together . " Good ! " he said . ' " It marches ! " Before we left the shelter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only that my name was Jean Marie Claude Decourbes , but that I was born in St. Remy de Provence , that my parents were Agathe and Antoine Decourbes , that I had one brother and five sisters , that I had been captured by the British frigate Garonne in the year 1809 . Jeddy , being more flexible with his face and hands and shoulders , had delved deeper into his private life , and was taking pride in having wed a woman of Morlaix during the year 1804 and in being the father of two daughters . Having arranged to return on the following day , we crossed the stone-flagged yards , slimy from dirt and the unending moisture of the Dartmoor mists . Swarms of yellow-clad prisoners were ' walking , gabbling , yelling , playing childish games and working at various pursuitswhile waiting for their noontime soup to come from the copper boilers of each prison 's cookhouse . Something about the tumult dulled my sense of individuality , and suddenly it seemed to me that I was no longer Richard Nason , but was indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up in this dank and soursmellingprison since the year 18o9 . Yet this day was the fourth of April , and we had been where we were for less than a week . I was moved to wonder how we would feel about it if we had been there for years , instead of for a day or two . There came a time when datesP241meant little ; but this date of April 4th was one that will never slip me , any more than will some of the dates that closely followed . We had no sooner reached our bay and set out our plates and cups in preparation for the coming of Tommy Bickford with the bucket of soup than King Dick passed , attended by the Bishop and the Duke . He grinned at me languidly , but went on without speaking . Yet he had no sooner vanished into his own bay , with the Bishop and the Duke popping in after him like two dogs popping into a cave after a bear , than he reappeared again alone and came lightly down the alley to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkling his forehead until the lines on it looked like the depth lines on a chart , " you an ' Feevolus been ovah to Number Sem to see ' at old Gin'ral Le Feeber ? " I said we had . He made a slight movement of his melon-like head : a movement that seemed to indicate he wished to see me alone . Even as I got to my feet my heart began to pound against my ribs like the strokes of a gunner 's sponge . I knew as well as though he had written it out that somehow he was bringing me the news I had known I must have ever since I sat in the longboat in Plymouthharbor , peering vainly through the slanting curtain of rain at the dripping stern windows of the Granicus , 74 . I walked with him away from our bay . " ' At old Gin'ral Le Feeber , " he said , turning a lackadaisical eye on me , " he 'll learn you moh French ' an anyone . " I could hardly speak until I had gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got something for me , " I said , when I could talk without choking . " Yarse ! " His black paw half opened before my face , and I saw a square of soiled paper resting against his pink palm . I took it from him . " White man come into ' at market ' is mohnin ' , sellin ' aigs . He ast Agnes foh somebody ' at knowed ' em Americans ; an ' Agnes , she sent Clerphus Lapp foh me . " Agnes , I knew , was the pretty vegetableseller from the near-by village of Tavistock , who came each day to the market . " Ah wouldn ' tell nothin ' to nobody , ' f Ah was you , " he added darkly . " Do n't do nobody no good , seppen to give ' em somep'n to talk about . " The note was printed roughly in pencil : " Please be selling something in the market one week from to-day that will be zz April . " It was unsigned , but I needed no signature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at look off yo ' pan , " King Dick said severely . " Doan ' go lookin " at way lessen you want somebody follerin ' you roun ' to see effen he kai n't git to know about somep'n wuff sellin ' . " I showed him the message . " Whah ' is lady comin ' fum ? " he wanted to know . " What makes you think it 's a lady ? " He chuckled a fluty , hysterical chuckle . " ' At ain ' no way answer King Dick ! Whuffoh you got ' at li'l ' sizzicky look in yo ' eye effen ' tai n't a lady ? Mebbe you git ' at look foh an ole man wif whiskers , huh ? Nossuh ! Naw SUH ! " " Well , " I said , " I do n't know for sure , but I think you 're right , and I want to sell something in the market a week from to-day . " " ' At ai n't no trouble , " he assured me in his weakest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Anything , " I told him . " I want you to buy something for me ; something that 'll let me into the market : something a lady 'd like to buy . " He nodded . " ' Ey 's some nice li'l ' ships finishin ' up ovah in Number One , " he said . " Hund'ed gun ship , foh feet long : make a nice li'l ' present f oh a lady . " " No , " I told him , " that 's too large for a lady . " " Nice If 1 ' frigate ovah in Number Five , " he said . " No bigger'n mahP243han ' . " He opened his gigantic fist and stared admiringly at the vast spread of bone and sinew . " Got a lady foh a figgah-haid . " " That 's what I want , " I said . " Get it for me , and tell the man to paint the figurehead with a green dress . " I think I might have sickened from impatience if my waiting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison on the iuth day of April and sent the eight thousand Frenchmen into a bricking frenzy . Because most of these Frenchmen had been in Dartmoor since 8o6 , which was the year the prison was built , they had found means circumvent their jailers in the matter of newspapers . The British ed to deprive the prisoners of all news , but French newspapersd English too were delivered to the Frenchmen neatly baked in eaves of bread . When these loaves came into Prison Number Seven on the morn- , h of April 9th there arose such an uproar from the prisoners that is soldiery came out of the barracks on the run . Frenchmen poured from Number Seven like a swarm of hornets , d the din brought other swarms from Number Six and Number We . The uproar swelled and swelled until gamblers , Negroes andhalf-naked French came tumbling down from the second floor ande cock loft of Number Four . It spread to the yard beyond us , wheree gray bulks of Number Three , Number Two and Number One ouched with noses pointed at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . We ran to the covered walk along the wall between the prison sills and the market place ; for it was only along the walk that we would pass from the yard of Number Four into the others . When we tered the yard of Numbers Seven , Six and Five , there were four thousand yellow-clad figures in it , weeping , embracing and kissing , Frenchmen so often do . Somewhere among them started the song t goes , " Allons , enfants de la Patrie , Le jour de gloire est arrive "  |  --  a song that sends quivers along my spine . Others ran about in a frenzy , shouting " Viva l'Empereurl " " Vive la France ! " in strange , cracking , trembling voices , or stood helplessly in their grotesque , pinched-looking yellow suits marked with the broad arrow of the criminal and the staring letters T. O.  --  stood with tears trickling and trickling from their eyes as if there would never be an end to their weeping . We watched them in silence , wondering what ailed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stare round eyed . At length General Le Febvre and another man came pacing toward us , watching their excited countrymen out of eyes that seemed too hard and old for tears . General Le Febvre nodded curtly . " You know about this ? " he asked , gesturing toward the yellow-clad thousands . We shook our heads . His features were rigid , in spite of what he had said to me about expressing the feelings through the face . " It is done , " he said . " The wolves have pulled down the lion . Bonaparte is finished , and the Allies have taken Paris . Now the wolves have nothing more to ' ar , and we shall go back to our own country . " He stalked off with his friend , his eyes as tragic as those of a man who has lost all he loves ; and it was plain to be seen that the butcher Bonaparte , who cared no more for him than for a fly crawling on the wall , had held as much of his heart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeddy repeated , echoing the general . It dawned on me , then , why the general had insisted and insisted until we had almost come to believe it ourselves , that Jeddy was Felix Berthot and I Jean Marie Claude Decourbes , enseigne de vaisseaude la Marine Imperiale de France . P245The market square of Dartmoor Prison was a busy place , even underthe worst of conditions , for all the petty shopkeepers among the prisoners were in constant need of replenishing their stores of tobacco , pipes , needles , thread , awls , boots ; pots , pans , and pails ; butter , eggs , cloth , coffee , tea , beer , rum , meat , fish , soap , and God knows what-all . But on this eleventh day of April it was busier than I had seen it in my short stay  --  busier , I think , than it had ever been . Not only were patches of blue sky showing now and again through the low-lying fog bank that hung perpetually over the prison when rain was not falling , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the news of Bonaparte 's defeat had brought French emigres by the score to congratulate their countrymen on the end of their imprisonment , and to seek supporters among the old soldiers  --  supportersfor the king who was now to be hoisted back on the throne of France by the English . Against the side walls of the square were rails to which were tied the donkeys of the market folk who had ridden in from Tavistock and Widecombe-in-the-Moor and Moreton-Hampstead  --  donkeys that added to the turmoil by bursting into brays so mournful that they might have been an embodiment of the hopelessness of all the nine thousand prisoners . The market folk were ranged behind long trestle tables set in a double row down the center of the square , while the Jews **25;798;TOOLONG WALKING along the little path again , in the brief , precious freshness of a new morning , Esteban was thinking about the mustang , whether he could keep it for his own , to what extent it could learn manners . The patio gate and the roses disturbed his train of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He felt hostile towards her , as though she were deliberate in disturbing him , and though his pulse increased and he felt his heart beating , he kept a merely courteous face as he bowed , swinging his sombrero . She had started speaking  --  Buenos dias , Don Esteban . I watched you riding yesterday '  --  before she realized that again that delightful , amazed look was replaced by resentment , apparently towards her . Her tongue halted and her temper flared , partly at him , partly at herself for letting her voice pause . Esteban saw the flush in her clear skin , and was delighted , feeling that it was she now who was bothered . She was moving to go , stiffening , and he was all of a rush to seize the moment . Without thought of any kind , he blurted out , You ride so well yourself , senora ! ' And then checked , feeling like an idiot . She began to laugh , they both laughed , Esteban out of relief , she because she had what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking one out of the basket . He did not move his hands . With that , and half a cigar , I should be up with the mozo , Juan . ' She considered him thoughtfully . He had temper . She had made a real dent in him . Esteban felt that he had given himself away . With sudden , delighted malice she cut the butt of a stem , Here , Senor Mansacaballos , are the thorns , for you only . ' He took the twig solemnly and set it behind his ear like a flower . That is true . And I shall make a rose for it . ' He bowed . She curtsied . He walked off , feeling slightly intoxicated . He went on down to the corral and worked on the black horse , accustoming it to his presence . Then he groomed the palomina . He rode with Marcos to the pasture on the south side of Rashwitz to look at some new foals . The next day , for no good reason , he took a path that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it , and exchanged formal courtesies with Dona Favia . Slowly he taught the mustang to accept him , but the animal was so free with its heels that the Indians named it Ek Ahau , Black Captain , after a halfforgottengod who went about destroying . Esteban accepted the name . He went to Sacabil to sell horses . Sacabil was a big town , but it bowed to Cerromayor ; even the Jefe Politico would be nothing if Don Gerbnimo so decided . He rode through the highland villages from Santa Ana to Pokoj , looking for a stolen mule ; his position was his warrant , the Indian alcalde readily had the thief flogged . He went to Sacabil again to fetch the North American stallion Don Ger6nimo was importing to raise a bigger breed of horses , primarilyfor the First ( Cerromayor ) Squadron of the Guardia Presidencial . Bringing in that stallion was a task , for Ek Ahau took a hate to it on sight , as though the mustang resented this pedigreed intrusion into its native mountains . The two clays ' trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three of them . He brought the animals to the main gate for inspection , and as he sat there in the saddle , recounting his tale to Don Ger6nimo and Dona Favia , he was aware of dirt and dust and fatigue-lines , and his unshaven chin sprouting single , wiry , Indian whiskers . He was unaware of the charm of the half-exasperation , halflaughterthat sat upon him ; the mastery with which , while he talked , he handled the two angry beasts was unconscious . Clouds gathered like dark plumes above the higher mountains to northward . The rains were approaching . In the mornings he walked past the patio of the statue and exchanged salutes , or he avoided it and then was disgusted with himself , or he walked past it and found no one , and was wretched . Day and night , sleeping and walking , working and resting he was obsessed by Dona Favia . Ek Ahau was his only comfort . He cut out the ' Dona ' in his mind , and chanted ' Favia , Favia , Favia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone was not a creature of Cerromayor . Villansuela , and her beauty that was like a proclamation , did notP53depend on anything . He was aware of that , he was confusedly aware of her as a symbol , as he was of the pureness of race in her beauty . Had one opened his mind and spread it forth , one would have had difficultydetermining which possessed him , the girl or the archtype . The moon passed its full . One morning the distant top of Yalankan volcano was covered for a few hours with white snow . That evening at sunset an exhausted man , covered with dust , his shirt blood-soaked , rode a worn-out horse into the main patio of San Pedro and there fell , slipping slowly at first , then faster and faster from the saddle . They lifted his head and gave him water . He talked feebly . Pokoj sublevacion  --  han muortos todos . ' He wanted to say more , but Don Geronimo checked him with a brief ' enough . ' He was carried in , mur-muring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muortos todos . ' One of the houseboys met Esteban leaving the corral . ' Don Geronimo says '  --  the boy checked and caught his breath  --  ' the Indians have risen at Pokoj and killed everyone , everyone . A man just rode in , he was all blood , he fainted . Don Geronimo says saddle your best horse and get ready to go to Sacabil , quick , quick . ' ' Very well . ' Esteban turned and called , ' i Marcos , oiga , Marcos ! ' He reported at the gate inside of half an hour , riding Ek Ahau . Don Geronimo and Favia waited there , withP54excited boys carrying torches on either side . In the portal , servants were arranging a row of muskets . You are quick , ' said the patron ; have you pistols ? ' Esteban pointed to his saddle-holsters and the handle of his machete. 1 shall pass through Santa Catalina . God knows what they 'll be up to . ' Good . ' I sent Marcos out after the horse-boys , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warn the vaqueros at Niana . ' Well done , Esteban . You should be a general . Now , take this letter , it will give you authority . ' Esteban took the paper . Its address was no larger than the words from G. Cerromayor y R , ' the most impressive thing about it was the big , red seal . Go to General Martinez himself , no matter what the hour . We want the whole troop of cavalry , and he should be able to spare one company of infantry to follow . When can you get there ? ' ' By dawn . ' Is it sure ? ' Sure . ' Esteban patted his horse 's quarter . See that the cavalry come as fast as they can . The infantry may follow slower . It may be necessary to leave some at Santa Catalina . ' I 'll bring the cavalry back myself . ' Don Geronimo nodded and his eyes gleamed . Goodboy ! ' Favia said , Here is food for you , ' and handed up a gourd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chocolate posol . ' P55Many thanks , senora . ' Esteban was on top of the world , the hour was his and he knew it . He looked Favia straight in the eye as he stooped to take the parcel , a cheerful look , full of defiance . A stirrup cup , ' Don Geronimo said . Here , take . ' He poured good brandy into three fragile glasses , and they drank solemnly . Good luck to you , go well , my boy . You carry the Highlands on your shoulders . ' Go with God , and strength to your little horse . ' To your peace and health , senora , and my service to you , senor . ' They were all Latins , who knew how not to waste the occasion . Esteban whirled his horse sharp and was off , trotting , with a last , cheerful Adios , ' and a wave of his hat . Trotting ? ' asked Favia . Yes . A man gets out of sight fast enough at a gallop , but the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Esteban sat forward in the saddle , his weight partly on his toes in the stirrups , partly on his hands , braced against the horn . He called mentally on the Black Captain , and repeated Favia 's name . The night was cold , the air a little damp , so that smells reached him keenly  --  the green wetness of live-oak , the sharp warmth as his horse began to sweat a little , that indescribable , fresh odour where a brook , faintly steaming , crossed the trail . Ek Ahau 's fast trot was a crepitationof hoof-beats each of slightly different sound , continuously and rapidly repeated , with sudden , irregularaccents as his shoes clinked on stones . In the saddle ,   it was hardly more than an exhilarating vibration , carrying to Esteban the sense of his mount 's unslackening , easy effort . The Black Captain was used to him now , used to the feel of saddle and bridle , associatingharness and rider with the pleasure of motion . Mounted , all he asked for was a chance to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctto take the.steep parts at a gallop . At the top he dismounted , threw off saddle and bridle , and tethered the horse on a long rope to allow rolling and grazing . From the seep under the rock by Rashwitz Cross he got water to mix with posol in his gourd , and then sat , sipping , tasting the corn and chocolate , chewing slowly . A lopsided moon began to rise , making jumbled , silver lines and enormous stretches of deep , velvet-edged shadows where mountain ridge behind ridge lay to eastward . Esteban figured that by the time he reached the slope down to Sacabil , the moon would be westerly , so that they would have light on the trail . It was close on to midnight and really frosty when he reached Santa Catalina . He slowed to a quiet walk , watching the straggling huts for signs of life . Everythingwas silent , save at the church . Looking through the door , as he crossed the plaza , he saw the interior all a glow of candlelight , the floor black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blouses of Indianspraying . He knew that neither by Christian nor by Rashti rule was this a holy clay ; it looked serious . He reined in a moment to peer carefully , feeling it unwiseto go nearer . There were little flashes of light and narrow shadows  --  yes  --  over the crook of each man'sP57left arm projected the naked blade of his machete . He spoke softly to his horse and went on , drawing his heels up against the saddle flap to keep his spurs from ringing . At the far end of the village three whitewashed houses belonged to Ladinos . Two were dark ; the third and largest , which had a tile roof , showed light under the door and in the chinks of the shutters . Here he dismountedand knocked gently . A voice called , ' z Quien vive ? ' ' Cerromayor . ' They opened the door a crack , saw him standing there with the lead-rope over his arm  --  Ek Ahau would break his bridle any day  --  and swung the door wide . Come in , friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw the three families gathered there , looking worried , the men with guns in hand . A row of candles burned before a little altar of Rosario . ' I am on my way to Sacabil to fetch troops . They have risen at Pokoj . ' Have they , then ? Anywhere else ? ' Not yet . ' ' They have been quiet here for the last two days . Yesterday we confiscated all the liquor . ' Don Martin Sanchez spoke for the group , he being the Secretario Municipal , representing the federal government . That has checked them , but they have powder . We are afraid to move . ' ' I shall have troops here by noon tomorrow . Now you must send word to San Pedro of what is going on here . Don Geronimo will probably send you some men , he has called everyone in , and we muster over thirty . ' ' Send word ? How ? We are only four men here now , and we are watched . ' ' Put someone on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , they are all in the church . Let him go fast , that 's all . You must send word . ' Esteban spoke decisively . ' Very well . Pedro , will you go ? My bay mare is in the compound . ' ' Good . ' ' God speed you , Esteban mio . Take a drink ? ' ' With great pleasure . ' They handed him an earthenware cup of aguardiente . Salud . ' ' Salud , pues . ' ' Adios . ' ' Go well , take care of yourself . ' He continued his quiet progress till he was well clear of the village . They were still at the praying stage , not ready to act yet . He climbed through a belt of fragrant pines and then picked his way up the head of a gorge , leading his horse . At the top , over open , rolling , grazingcountry all green-blue and silver under the moonlight , the racing trot began again . With each stride he felt the forward reach of Ek Ahau 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still good for more . Where another cross , rotted and awry , slanted byP59the roadside , the upland broke without transition to the sudden slope down to the valley of Sacabil , two thousand feet below . It was well past midnight . Esteban rested again , took posol , smoked a cigarette . Now he would see what his horse was good for , if his horse knew anything . Here was the bad trail , the moonlight was faint upon it . This , then , would try him , the little horse . Ever since Santa Catalina he had been thinking in Rashti . Now , as he started down , he spoke aloud  --  ' Nian in cite , shumal-on witsin '  --  heard himself and checked angrily . Favia was so close behind his mind that he was alarmed , imagining if she should overhear him . ' Vamos , caballito mio , companero , vamonOs . ' He remembered , as he had at intervals all night , the man flogged at Pokoj . His conscience was clear , but the traitorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words  --  ' The celadores took it from me , that mule , when they caught me smuggling . I am a smuggler , how then can I live without one my little mule ? For that , then , I had to have him , I took him back , my little mule . ' Then he was too busy for that kind of thinking . The trail , sometimes a yard , sometimes two yards wide , deeply worn , wriggled down the mountainside like a snake . Ek Ahau knew the way , and knew that below was a stable and fodder . He slowed to a fox-trot , once or twice he walked , but in the half darkness , over the had footing , he moved alarmingly fast . Esteban leant well back , holding ready rein for a stumble . In the last hundred yards or so the trail lost form ,  | spreading out over the talus like a river 's delta . The mustang zigzagged , his little feet quick and sure on the sand and loose rocks . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Esteban wanted to cheer aloud . Then they reached the little cluster of houses at the foot , and he lifted his horse to a lope along the good road . The pila and another group of houses were just a kilometre from town . They stopped for water and went on again briskly . Striking the cobbles where the houses on either hand began to touch each other , he fell to a trot again , hoofs ringing , throwing out sparks . They seemed to be making a terrific racket , the town was so fast asleep , the one-story , shuttered houses soft blue and deep , night-coloured shadow , the streets so empty , the houses so closed in upon people warm asleep in beds . A watchman unslung his rifle and called , z Quinn vive ? Por adonde se va ? ' Esteban shouted back without stopping , i Alturas y Cerromayor ! SublevaciGn en los Altos ! ' The watchman repeated SublevaciOn ! ' and hurried after him . He turned down the ( ' alk 14 de Junio and halted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He banged on the door with his fist , calling i Oye , oye ! Open ! ' A voice cried sleepily , z Quinn vive ? Que gente ? ' Alturas y Cerromayor ! Uprising in the Highlands ; open the door ! ' A light showed through chinks , and he heard whispers inside . The watchman joined him . P61'What 's up ? Why , it 's Don Esteban ! ' ' It 's I. The Indians have risen at Pokoj , and all the Highlands over that way are stirring . ' ' i Ay , Dios ! ' The watchman started kicking the door . ' Is that you in there , Pablo , stupid ? It 's Sinor de Cerromayor from San Pedro . Open ! ' A bolt was slid and the postern swung back . A soldierstood in the aperture , torch in hand , hatless , his coat unbuttoned , his hair sticking out all over his head . Behind him stood another , with bayonet fixed . ' What 's the matter ? ' Esteban thrust the letter towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressive . ' Urgent business with General Martinez . There is an uprising at Pokoj , very serious , many dead . ' ' Come in . ' ' Open the big door , I ca n't bring my horse through that . ' They swung the main door wide , and Esteban entered . ' Keep clear of the animal 's heels , ' he warned . ' Now , where is the Sinor Jefe Politico ? Call him . ' The two soldiers looked at each other uncertainly . Just then the sergeant of the guard stepped out of a door in the side of the archway , buttoning on his sword . He was a competent , broad-faced , hard-looking Indian . Behind him followed two other men with rifles . ' What offers itself ? ' he asked . Esteban handed him the letter . He could read no more than the others , but he recognized the Cerromayorseal of the lion couchant at the base of a tri- angular mountain , and he had seen Esteban before , in the Jefe Politico 's office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an uprising at Pokoj , and trouble all through the Nimangil Highlands . I must see the Sinor Jefe at once . ' Very well . ' A man moved to loosen Ek Ahau 's cinch , but Estebanwaved him back , saying , He 's mean . ' As he removed the saddle , he added , We left San Pedro just after sundown. ' i Ay Dios ! Cat-ail ' Truth . Come along , sergeant . ' The man took a torch and led the way to a door in the colonnade on one side of the patio . Here he rapped softly . Harder , man ! ' The sergeant looked at him doubtfully . The general will be cross . ' Esteban waved his letter . A ghost of a smile hovered on the sergeant 's face as he fell to and hammeredat the door , shouting , iMi general ! Mi general ! Sublevacion ! Insurreccion ! Revolucion ! ' A voice called from within , someone moved . The sergeant , with just a little more of a smile , stepped back outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , pistol in hand . His nightshirtblew around his ankles . What the devil ? ' Urgent message from Don Geronimo , sinor . Up-P63rising at Pokoj , everybody killed . All our part of the Highlands is stirring . ' Esteban held out the letter . ' Carramba ! Is that you , Don Esteban ? ' He took the letter . One moment . Sergeant ! ' The sergeant stepped forward and saluted . ' Tell the cook to start a fire and make coffee . Wake Colonel Fuentes , tell him to have the garrison under arms immediately . ' He turned to Esteban again . I 'll meet you in the kitchen , it 's cold . ' General Martinez , in undress uniform , came into the kitchen just as the coffee began to boil . His presence in no way stopped the cook 's loud grumbling . Geronimo only mentions Pokoj , ' he said . Esteban told him what he had seen at Santa Catalina . Hm-m . It 's had . I suppose they knew about it long beforehand . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes you will send the troop right away , and a company to follow . ' Yes , he says that in the note . ' Just then , clearer and sharper than the cry of a rooster , they heard a bugle blowing . The general poured coffee for himself and Esteban , and a liberal measure of San Lazaro . The hot drink and fiery liquor , flavoured with anise , were welcome . ' Come along to the plaza . ' I 'll saddle up first and join you there . I took the liberty of having my horse put in your stable . ' Man , you are n't going back now ! When did you leave ? ' ' Just after sunset . '  |p64'Carramba  ! You 're for bed , and your horse will be worn out . ' We 're all right , and my orders are to return with the troops . ' Very well , meet me in the plaza . ' In the blackness under the shed , Ek Ahau was noisily chewing . He took a flying kick at Esteban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without further protest , being too busy eating . He objected to having his head lifted for the bridle , however , and there was a tussle in the dark before he was led out , still chewing , and feeling mean . Esteban did not mount , but led him . The line of the arched entrance , the ridges of the houses , were sharply defined . Shadows were smoky and blue . The sky had cold light in its darkness . Suddenlythe secret time is over , the night is going , and it always takes one by surprise . Esteban felt tired and let down . Somehow , for that moment , the adventure has slipped out of his fingers . Soldiers were forming in the plaza , the white facings and cross-belts showing clearly . The sandalled infantrymade little noise , the cavalry rattled and clattered cheerfully . General Martinez , Colonel Fuentes , and a captain stood together . The general turned to Esteban . The cavalry can start right away , I want to let the infantry have some food . I must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . Colonel Fuentes will bring the other to San Pedro , leaving a guard at Santa Catalina if need be . At San Pedro a platoon from Mazatan , and the celadores detachmentp65from there , will join him . I 'm sending word to the capital , and to Santiago , asking for reenforcements . If Don Geronimo will advise the comandante at Culuatepec , he will patrol that section , though I do n't think he can spare many men from frontier duties . ' Very good , sir . ' Ek Ahau regretted the stable and desired to fight Captain Hernandez ' horse for the first league , until they began to climb in earnest . Then he made up his mind for San Pedro and pushed forward . Esteban led the horse up the steeper parts of the climb . In the cold morning he still felt fresh , but he dreaded meeting the sunlight when they got to the top . Noon was going to be disagreeable . He looked down on the forty men climbing behind him , and thought that the lances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white hats with their green plumes and visors and gold braid . The fact of himself leading horsemen to the rescue cheered him , he caught his adventure again , visualizing their arrival at Uyala . At the top they rested , and he shared the last of his posol with the captain and lieutenant . Ek Ahau kicked two horses and a corporal . Esteban got them started again much sooner than they liked , the whole troop stretching to keep with that machine-like , racing trot . His tired mind tried to think in Spanish , but kept slipping a cog . He kept talking to the little black horse in Rashti . At Santa Catalina the sun was already hot and the trail dusty , there was no more life in the air . There they found eight San Pedro men reenforcing the local people ; no Indians were to be seen . Captain Hernandezand Esteban conferred with the Secretario . The Indians have all gone into the woods , ' Sanchez told them . I think they are afraid , but dangerous . ' They agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lieutenant with twelve soldiers . The vaqueros had been laying bets on Ek Ahau , they examined his condition with great interest , and Esteban brightened in response to their praises . He took the lead again , leaning heavily with stiff arms on the saddle horn , hurrying , hurrying . He began to see queer things on the trail . He almost fell asleep , felt himself slipping , and straightened . Now once or twice he had to give the little horse a touch of spurs , but they were passing Rashwitz , and Ek Ahau felt the nearness of home . His thoughts were confused , running at moments into hallucinations . He was thinking entirely in Indian without knowing it ; he had no idea that he was thinking about Favia in Rashti . Now and again he roused himself to look back . In the presence of the vaqueros , the soldiers kept up better , Captain Hernandez followed close behind Esteban . He looked tired , and he was getting too much of the mustang 's dust , but he would not fall back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man smuggle if there is not one his little mule for him ? Esteban kept seeing the man 's face , hearing his explanation . It hooked itself up in some way with hisP67own mother . If he could only get it straight in his head , there was something more than just the mule , something that covered the whole Highlands , but he was too tired . When he got to Pokoj he would think it out and explain to the Indians , and they would not be angry . They must understand about smuggling , and that only Favia was secure . He started to slip again , and caught himself . If his mother could talk to Favia there could be union , but then he did not know with what . He was thinking too much , so tired . He wrenched his mind away from puzzling . It was because he was tired , for that , then , he was thinking so . This his mind was full of dust and too much heat from the sun . The wide avenue opened before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ek Ahau to a gallop . The men came up behind him grandly . This was the way he must do it because he had arranged it so . It was a climax , but he did not remember to what . He did not care , if only he could explain to that man about his mule . The troop stopped outside the gateway , where a dozen ranchmen stood on guard . Esteban , Captain Hernandez , and the head vaquero rode into the patio . Don Gersnimo met them . ' Well done , Esteban ! Welcome , Senor Capitan . Enter . ' There were a number of people in the sala , but only Favia was real , her white face and throat gleaming there where it seemed dark after the bright sunlight . Don Ger6nimo said ,   Take a drink , my boy , and go to bed . ' Esteban was looking at Favia , feeling a fire behind his eyes . The voice came dimly out of a towering , vague figure . He turned towards it , almost spoke in Rashti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must go to Pokoj . ' What ? ' ' I must straighten it out about the mule . ' He knitted his brows , remembering that he did not understand it himself . I have to bring them together . ' Don Geronimo started to speak , but his wife signalledto him . Why not ? ' she said . Sit down a minute while we get some food for you and the men change horses . ' Her voice rested him , it was something sure . He turned and looked at her with unguarded eyes . Did you see my horse ? ' he asked . Then the meaning of her words reached him , and he said , Yes , thank you , ' and sat down on a couch . In a moment he would unsaddle Ek Ahau , in a moment . Her eyes dropped when he was looking at her . He would just rest a moment , just relax . The deep lines slackened around his mouth , he went limp . Favia considered him . Her husband , who spoke of their union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the getting of many bastards . This man was young , he , was brave , he had temper . There was danger in him , under all that subordination . He rode beautifully . She just wanted to look at the fringe of that interesting danger . At present his face wasP69dirty , he looked like a small boy . She began to call his name , laughing . He had the dried , thorny stem pinned under the left side of his bolero , but Favia was holding the rose that belonged to it , still fresh . There was some kind of finemeshednet all around him . She had played this joke on him , and she was laughing at him . It was not fair . He and Ek Ahau were going a thousand leagues to Pokoj to settle something . This was his hour ; he had brought the lancers to San Pedro , like a hero . He thrust his arms out violently , broke tree , and sat up , exclaiming , ' I brought you lances for the thorns ! ' Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by half a dozen candles , night was dark outside the door . Only Favia stood there , smiling at him . He shook his head and blinked again . She laughed . Ay Dios , she was beautiful . He said , ' What  --  where  --  what hour is it ? ' ' Past ten , friend . It will be a scandal if you stay here longer . ' She thought that he was really adorable , so confused and sleepy , with the dust and stain of his deeds still upon him , the machete like a sword at his belt . He stood up . ' Is my horse all right ? ' ' Who knows ? We tried to unsaddle him , he kicked Jose and ran away . ' ' Where are the men ? ' ' Gone to Pokoj , with my senor husband . Thorns for the rebels . '  |p70'Thorns  ? ' He stared , then understood and began to blush deeply . Favia 's mouth quivered towards a delighted smile . ' Wake up , horse-breaker ! They are keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her voice softened  --  ' you have earned it . ' She walked over to the table at the end of the room , and poured a drink of the best brandy . ' Here , this will clear your mind . ' ' Very many thanks . To your health . ' Never before in her life had she been alone thus with a young man , she was enjoying herself . The liquor , on his empty stomach , did him almost too much good . ' Now go and eat , Don Esteban . Oh , you have done well !  --  Wait . ' She left the room , while he stood collecting himself , and tasting over the fullness of what he had accomplished . She returned with a rose , a large one in perfect condition . ' This is fairly yours . ' He was the king of the world at the moment he touched the flower . He just leant forward and kissed her on the mouth . She jumped back and cried ' Ay ! ' She was all girl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before she could recover enough even to be angry , he picked his sombrero from the couch and swung a bow . ' A thousand thanks , senora . That is my rose . ' Then , straightening , . ' With your permission . ' ' It is yours , ' she said in a small , formal voice . He bowed again and walked out , spurs ringing , his machete at his side , beginning to feel a little tipsy .   HE HALF woke to hear a bugle , smelt the air not yet touched by the sun , and fell asleep again . Then the mozo was calling him . ' Don Esteban ; if you please , Don Esteban . ' He stirred and sat up , at first thinking only that it must be late , and he wanted coffee . The boy was admiringhim . In one hand he held a cup of coffee , with the other he dragged a shattered saddle , the wooden tree sticking through the leather like broken bones . Esteban began to remember . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , and one of your pistols . We found them on the road just above Cuchen . To know where the other pistol is ! ' ' Eh ? Oh yes . And the little black ? ' ' Who knows ? Perhaps at Chisbaj again . Perhaps God knows . ' Esteban smiled and nodded . ' He 's all right , if he 's rid of his saddle . I was afraid he might be hurt by it . I.et 's have the coffee . Will you get me some cigarettes ? I 'm famished for them  --  and for your little life , do n't get them from Don Sebastiano , I ca n't stand that stuff . ' Ile drank coffee and sifted his thoughts ; they came in a rush and had to be arranged chronologically . He went over and over his session with the lady , fearing to find himself an offensive blunderer . She had surely looked angry  --  or surprised . One would see . The boy returned , panting , with a handful of cigarettesmade with black paper . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , sinor . They 're very good . ' Esteban perceived that he was an object of hero worship . When he was a boy , he had stolen them sometimeshimself . He accepted the tribute . ' Many thanks . ' He wrapped himself in a cloud of smoke . ' What news ? ' ' There 's a colonel here and about sixty soldiers and some celadores . The lady has six of our men guarding the house . ' ' And Pokoj , Santa Catalina , here at Uyala ? ' ' The caporales came up from Uyala a little while ago . They said that the village was good , and please not to quarter any troops there . ' ' What did she say ? ' ' She ? Oh , they went to Don Sebastiano . He told them all right , but be good . ' ' And Pokoj ? ' ' No news yet . The cavalry all went there , and Don Geronimo and some of our men . There 's a garrison at Santa Catalina and another at San Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take the whole brigade on a march through the Department . Chickenswill be scarce this year . ' ' No doubt . Anything else ? ' ' Oh ! The man who brought the news died , the poor man . ' P73God receive his soul . ' Esteban crossed himself . Who was he ? ' Jorge Martinez , the sugar planter . ' Oh , that one . Well , we 'll never collect what he owes us . He 's paid , to my thinking . ' The boy nodded and hung around the door , reluctant to go . Run along , child . You have work to do . ' He vanished , like an embarrassed rabbit . Esteban was tempted to avoid the patio of the statue , then thought better of it , and went that way . There was no one there . Most of the roses were overpast , he noticed . Down at the corrals he found only Jesus and one Indian . Where are the others ? ' he asked . Gone off to Pokoj . Felipe put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What horses did they take ? ' The big bay , the bay with white socks , the brown pinto , the two chestnuts , the wall-eyed pinto , the little sorrel , the grey mule and the two buckskin mules , the crop-ear , the blue roan , the bald-faced dun , the sorrel mule , the iron-grey , the four San Miguel horses , the Mexican mare , and the white with the brown saddle . ' Then the soldiers rode their own horses ? ' Yes , they had some good ones  --  and some by rat out of coyote . ' Has anyone seen the Black Captain ? ' No , not since we tried to unsaddle him . He 'll be around Chisbaj by now . Did you get the saddle ? ' Yes , it 's ruined . It cost me forty pesos . '   He took care of the palomina , borrowed a saddle , and went out with Jesfis to round up remounts . It would not be safe going into the mountains after Ek Ahau untilthings got quieter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of fast action , and the pretty sight of the remuda , twenty horses in fine fettle running before them as they returned , swinging their lariats and shouting . At moments as he rode he reflected disconnectedly . He had been so tired the day before that he could not remember it well , but he retained the feeling that he had almost seen something important , something that brought his mother and Pokoj and Favia and all together with him . Something about himself and the world . It was so indefinite that he would have dismissedthe matter , save for the clearness of his sense of having touched an unusual order and harmony within himself . Indian fashion , he conceived of thoughts as having independent existence and their own powers ; he was convinced that this powerful thought existed , but he had missed it , and mulling over was useless . The only thing to do was to wait . Meantime he rounded up horses , and dodged the question of what followed if Favia had enjoyed being kissed . The next morning as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panic came on him , he had not the faintest idea what to do . The momentum of his day of fame bore him up . Lightly does it , he decided . He bowed and greeted her . She answered formally . He undid the pin in his bolero and held out the witheredstem.  |p75'See  , senora , the thorns have come off it . I return it to you . ' He restrained himself from saying , ' It is superseded . ' She took the fragment and smiled . ' Never mind , I shall give you more . ' Again he kept himself from saying , ' I shall findflowers for them , ' but it showed in a flash of his eye . ' You have been high in the saddle these days , ' shewent on . He looked at her suspiciously . ' One is young for just so long . Anything lively that God sends , during that short time , is well sent . ' It was her turn to look suspicious . Esteban thought that that would do . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he asked . ' No , what happened ? ' ' He heard that there was an uprising in the Highlands , so he went out along the road with a green umbrellaand a machine for measuring earthquakes , and waited for the mountains to move . ' ' Not really ! ' ' Truth . He kept going on and on , and trying his instrument and shaking it , till he got almost to the top of the climb . Then some muleteers explained to him . He was furious . ' She laughed . They were both relieved to get onto a neutral subject . He started an imitation of French Spanish , which is always ludicrous ; he had the Indian 's close observation and gift of mimicry , it was a rood performance . Then he broke off .   Where are the soldiers ? What news ? ' A man came in about an hour ago . All is well . The infantry are going up to form a garrison for a while . They are bringing back the leaders . ' Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well on roses . ' The roses are out of season . ' With your permission . ' It is yours . ' At noon the cavalry and half the infantry returned , along with Don Ger6nimo and the San Pedro men . Four wounded men were carried in litters . Twelve of the cavalry each led an Indian , bound and weary , by a rope around the neck . Two of the prisoners , with blood soaking through their garments , stumbled at moments , to be jerked up roughly . There were marks on many of them where the soldiers ' quirts had landed when they faltered . As Esteban watched , he found himself growing seriously angry . He wanted to fight the soldiers , he hated them for the brutal humour with which they addressed their charges . He retreated behind the house to reason with himself , wondering what softness had come upon him . Those men had instigated massacre , hanging was a deserved fate , and yet he was unhappy . It was not because they would be hung , that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those poor devils round , something inhuman that got under his skin . Favia shamed him , he had never seen her look more the aristocrat than now , as she superintendedgiving out food to the men who had fought , P77and made arrangements for the wounded . Watching her , one never would have known that there was an Indian of any kind in sight . Don Gerbnimo beckoned Esteban . We owe you many thanks , friend . You will dine with us tonight . ' With great pleasure , senor . ' Colonel Fuentes and the other officers added their words . This was still in part Esteban 's hour , shared without jealousy with those who had been under fire . That dinner was curious ; at times it was as pleasant as any he had ever attended , at other times it was not . General Martinez had arrived during the afternoon , just ahead of the first shower of the rainy season , so there were six fine uniforms at table . The Jefe Politico and the colonel were educated men who had travelled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans , in North America . It was not every clay that Don Geronimo had company of this sort for conversation , and he improved the occasion . He brought out his best , dry , English sherry , which nobodybut he really liked , but which they all praised , he was full of pent-up anecdotes and good humour . They talked of the bourgeois affectations of King Philip , of Restoration salons and grand opera  --  here the captain , with New Orleans behind him , came into his own  --  of the appearance of a new Napoleon in France , of the troubles in Spain , the Bois de Boulogne , and the womenof Sevilla . Esteban , Captain Hernandez and the two lieutenants , and Favia behind her slowly moving fan , sat back and listened . She had heard such talk before , but the others were being shown glimpses of a world so much wider than the one they knew that it made them feel small and dizzy . Even when the politics or society of Alturas came up , they were taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant yet human outlook that was strange . English along the narrow , heavy table . Sparks of brightness in the wine-glasses were slightly hypnotizing . Betweentwo candles in heavy sticks , Favia 's face was enshrined , the soft light wonderfully bringing out the transparent clearness of her skin , her red lips and dark , magic eyes . After dinner there was coffee and brandy . Esteban , having learned that this smooth liquid had its potency , copied his elders in sipping slowly . The living-room had always seemed to him the height of elegance . It was a sizable hall , really , with three arched doorways giving on the patio . The plain , white walls were relievedby four large tapestries , extremely old and in fair condition , all bearing the Cerromayor arms . The stone floor was covered by a large carpet and a number of jaguar and puma skins . Don Geronimo 's father had furnished it completely in the style of Louis XVI ; with this furniture went two big , gold-framed mirrors , one at each end of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slept so soundly , wondered how he had kept from falling off it . To this mixed decor Don Geronimo the Anglophile had added one great innovation  --  a huge fireplace in approximate Georgian style , executed by native work/men . The fire burned nobly now , a comfortable focus . The gilt looked well under the candles and in the firelight , the floor coverings and tapestries made the big room snug enough . Esteban perched on an inadequate seeming chair and fingered his liqueur glass . Now the talk turned to the insurrection , and Favia made herself heard , speaking with surprising violence of murderous animals , hoping that a lesson would be taught . Esteban watched her nostrils dilate , she was magnificent . He supposed it was natural for women to feel more fiercely about these things , they were helpless , but he disliked the general implication of nonhumanityfor all Indians in her words , an implication which his sensitiveness carried around to reach himself . The officers talked like diplomats , carefully . All of them knew their host would be writing about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less echo his opinions , so they wanted to get him now , in General Martinez ' presence , to commit himself to praise . Don Gerbnimo understood the situation well enough , and not wishing to keep on the subject all night , summarized what each had done , commending them in turn . Promotions are slow in peace time , they were all grateful . Rut the outstanding individual performance was by t hat civilian so quiet in the corner , ' he said . You 're very silent , Don Esteban . ' I could hardly discuss Paris or Madrid with you , senor . Although I travel fast , I have not yet gone very far . ' P80They laughed , Martinez said Well spoken , ' and he caught a look from behind Favia 's fan . He needed that look . He had been divided between a continuing discomforton account of the prisoners , and the feeling of a man who is not sure of himself , that when he is not advancing himself he must be losing ground . He had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . Don Geronimo rose . Another drop , caballeros , before retiring . ' They all accepted , and drank with polite toasts . One by one they excused themselves ; there was nothingdistinctive in Favia 's words to Esteban . Her husband kicked the fire , took a little more brandy , then threw his cigar into the coals . Good talk , ' he said . It 's a comfort to have some men of education . ' He offered her his arm . Four young men in uniform , and that Esteban in a deep blue bolero  --  and then , nothing but good talk . ' She took his arm and walked beside him , waving her fan slowly .   THE rains came down in good earnest , early and hard , part spoiling the cochineal crop . Mornings were cold , with wisps of white and silver mist and the blue-green mountains soft against dark skies , afternoonsand nights were punctuated by hard , cold rain ; in the higher parts of the mountains there was ice and hail . Roads became almost impassable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rheumatism , scarcely left the house . In the villages began a season of prayer for the young crops . As one passed by the Indians ' huts at night one saw everywhere points of pale gold light , at the thresholds , under the fruit trees , around the cornfields , where t he little , black beeswax candles were set out . A whisperran like wind in corn leaves , the low , praying voices . On the haciendas time dragged . Some people drank a great deal , some flirted , there was time for cockfighting . An excuse for a dance was welcome . Even Sacabil and the southern part of the Department becameremote , the world for San Pedro Uyala was restrictedto the Nimangil Highlands , ringed in by a wall of smoky clouds . Towards the end of the first period of the rains came word of a Liberalista rebellion in Santiago , and Colonel Fuentes gathered his troops at San Pedro , save for one platoon left at Pokoj , for a mobilization in Sacabil . This was something to talk about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to say . The Liberals believed in rights for Indians and other such doctrines , and that alone was enough to damn them to a minority community of Ladinos in a cut-off mountain section , without going into their other traitorous , radical , irreligious ideas . They were bandits and malcontents , one hoped that this particular uprisingwould be utterly crushed , and the leaders all shot . The astonishing thing was how such people could find enough followers for their sporadic outbursts . Meantime , San Pedro profited by the momentary presence of officers to give a dance . Ladinos came in from other ranches and villages , wherever a horse could get through . San Pedro had plenty of musicians , four men at a marimba spelling off two guitars and a fiddle . Don Geronimo gave a tremendous feast , plenty of San Lazaro and plenty of laughter replacing the dry sherry and conversation of the last occasion . As the music began , a deputation of Indians arrived , with that mixture of respect and familiarity that a fiesta permits , begging a present for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liquor and several drinks under their sashes . Esteban danced with Pavia as often as he thought wise , during the rest of the time he exerted himself not to pay attention to her . Though that kiss had never been repeated , he had managed to maintain the relationshipthat came after , of two young people among many who were older . He stuck to that , bided his time , and avoided thinking.  |p83She  was very cordial to the officers , but he perceivedin her cordiality much the same intensity of feeling against Liberalistas that had characterized her in regard to the rebellious Indians , rather than personal interest . He remembered then , a story that he heard , of how two or three years ago some Villansuela was murdered by his workmen ; that , and the general atmosphere in which she had been reared , would make her loathe and fear anything that threatened the established order . Towards dawn , Don Ger6nimo , Favia , and Esteban stood together , laughing at the figure of Don Sebastiano , upright in a corner , fast asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about past the age for all-night dances . The other two were joking , speculatingon what kept the mayordomo erect , and how long he would stay so . The older man looked upon them for a moment as two children under his care ; she with a charm that touched his memory rather than his present self , Esteban all showy silver and blue and red , with dress sword swinging from silver-stitched belt , also in part like a memory . Don Ger6nimo was tired . He recalled that if he had done as his parents wished , he would have been this girl 's great-uncle . He saw them together and himself apart . A fire of jealousy for their sheer youth swept over him so fierce that the place swam , and he recovered to find his hand hard upon his sword hilt . He walked off , chewing his mustachios , thinking . When Colonel Fuentes departed , that afternoon , he carried a letter for the Minister of War in Olintlan.  | The rains continued . Rumours drifted in of the uprisingand its quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the roads improved . About the third sunny day , Don Ger6nimo sent for Esteban . Coming into the patio , he saw a sergeant and two soldiers there , and wondered what was up now . His employer stood in front of the fireplace , holding a magnificently official document in his hands . Come in , Esteban . Cover yourself , sit down . I have a good deal to tell you . Take a cigarette . ' They both smoked a few puffs . ' In this little corner of the Highlands , we live in peace and life is simple . But peace here depends on peace throughout Alturas . That is not entirely so simple . We need , always , good men in public office , able and loyal men in the army . We never have enough of them . I have come to the conclusion that you are naturally fitted for the military career . ' Don Ger6nimo paused . Esteban said slowly , ' I have never thought of it , senor . I know nothing beyond these ranches . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given ample proof of your ability , friend . The rest , you will learn . I have arranged for you to receive a commissionas sub-lieutenant in the First Squadron of the Guardia Presidencial . ' Then , speaking with emphasis , ' I have no doubt that you will win promotion , and advance yourself as you never would here . ' Those last words ' were the heart of the matter , Esteban thought . For a moment of panic he wondered how much his patr6n knew , and then decided , notp85much . To leave Uyala frightened him , to leave Favia was worse  --  but might be a good idea . And he had thought about the military life , often . That appealed to him , and the idea of seeing the capital . He nodded gravely . Very well , senor . When should I start ? ' Well said ! The day after tomorrow would do . Here is your commission . ' Esteban took the impressive document as though it were fragile . Don Geronimo smiled and held out his hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Subteniente de Cerromayor , I look to you for loyal and distinguished service to the Republic of Alturas . We hope you will honour us at dinner tomorrow night . ' With the greatest pleasure . By your permission . ' It is yours  --  oh , one moment . You will need some money for your equipment , I shall give you a draft on our offices in Olintlan , but have you any debts here ? ' None , sir . ' Very good . ' Then there was time for much thinking , as he made preparations in his room , as he selected another horse to go with Ek Ahau , as he rode out from Uyala to avoid the thousand questions and comments of his fellows . All that evening and the next day he saw nothing of Favia . He wondered if she had arranged this , or was it some suspicion on the patron 's part , or what ? fie had always hoped he would be taken to Olintlan on one of the hacendado 's periodic visits , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-born young men , he , Esteban the son of Serafina , who did not know his father 's last name , and who was by a fiction styled De Cerromayor . Only one thing was clear , he must do well , advance himself , become someone in his own right . He was eager and afraid . He went quietly to his mother 's grave to burn a candle . There he began by praying , but drifted off into a train of thought which was in part an attempt to communicate with her . Kneeling there , he tried to understand her sense of a great process in which they all were tools , that had always been so real to her ; with thoughts came again the unpleasant feeling of being misplaced , and a fraud . He thought about the Pokoj uprising , and tried to catch that vanished gleam of understanding he had seen when he rode back to Uyal . In the end he knelt , plucking idly at the grass , thinking how heavy that column must be , and wonderingjust what he did think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreeably unreal , fine phrases , much propounding from the older man , silver plate and candles and fine food , and Favia more remote and strange than the portraits on the walls . He rememberedlittle of what passed , being too busy acting his own necessary part , save for one speech of Don Gerbnimo 's , words spoken slowly and emphatically , that later seemed to have been the main reason for dinner and all the talk . Living here in Uyala , knowing only these mountainsand the confines of this Department of Sacabil , SPARKS FLY UPWARD 87the world may well seem to you simple . You are shortly going to learn that it is not . You know what suffering and disaster has been brought upon Central America by Morazan and his radicals . You do not know , as we do who from birth and position have the responsibility of guiding this republic , how close Alturas has come to undergoing that same torment . Peace , order , security , wealth , happiness , are maintainedonly by untiring watchfulness . In Olintlan you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hear ruinous doctrines clothed in beautiful words . Prepare yourself , my boy , and never forget that now you are assuming part of the burden of the welfare of the Republic . God grant that physical action against the monster , Revolution , may never be needed , but do not be deceived by peace : the struggle is constant . ' Esteban went to his room , morose and slightly tipsy . He sat on the edge of his bed , picking at the rawhide lacings and staring at the bright pictures of San Pedro and San Esteban pasted against the wall . Not a word , not a sign from her . Tomorrow he would be gone , putting leagues between himself and all familiarity , into a new life , utterly new . Dinner had been a funeral , he had sat and said yes ' and thank you ' at his own velorio . He wanted more to drink , but none could be had without waking people , and that would inevitably start a celebration in his honour , most unwelcome . Candelaria had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , not a difficult girl . Out of sheer meanness and perversity he considered going to the outhouse in which she slept and seeing what could be done about it , but he really disliked the idea too much to force himself . So he smoked and pitied himself and swore , and at last turned in . Then he could n't sleep . He became suddenly convinced that Favia was waiting for him , dressed in a hurry and went out for a vigil in the cold , wet night outside the patio of the statue . He grew angry as he shivered , decided that he never wanted to speak to her again , went back to bed , and at last slept.  | THE whole place gave him a send-off , cordial , noisy and heartening . He shook hands until his arm was tired , there were so many to embrace that he doubted if he would ever be able to mount his horse , and he received more small presents than his saddle bags could possibly have held . He had the thrill of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ek Ahau danced and shied and fought the led horse . It was a grand departure . Then he was alone on the trail , jogging along , taking himself by his own effort in the direction he least desired , astonished at his own ability not to turn back . Even so , he was more cheerful than he had been last night , with a little stir of adventure inside him . Towardsnoon he approached Rashwitz , looking constantly to right and left , noticing every familiar spot with loving attention . He heard a horse galloping towards him and wondered , now what ? Favia came around a bend in the trail , riding hard , the palomina all in a lather . Esteban halted , his stomach seemed to dissolve . She brought the mare to a stop beside him , saying , The little beast ran away , and I 've lost Felipe . ' Then she began to blush , knowing how well he knew her mare . Esteban suppressed a smile ; he was in such a whirl that all he could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muy buenos dias . ' They sat there , both embarrassed . He watched the colour mounting in her cheeks , and under his gaze saw it turn to almost a furious red . The sight helped him recover himself . Felipe will be all right , ' he said , and it is good fortunefor me to be able to say good-bye to you again . ' You speak sadly , mi teniente . We all expect you to return great and famous , and we shall admire you . ' My one ambition is to win your admiration . ' She changed the subject . Is that your new saddle ? Let me see . ' Don Geronimo had given it to him to replace the one Ek Ahau had destroyed . It was the best Sacabil work , made to order , white , silver-mounted tree with dark , stamped leather , a handsome thing . Esteban undid the roll behind him and pointed to the design , a formalized rose-tree , its thorns picked out with silver thread , running up to a flower of inlaid , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kept her eyes down . Esteban sat for an age , half turned in the saddle , his hand resting on the cantle . He looked very much at ease , but his heart was wild between his ribs . At last she looked up , apparently calm , and smiling . And now you 're changing thorns for lances again ? Adios , and go with God . ' She held out her hand . He took it , he extended his other arm , he touched her shoulder , he kissed her . There was no surprise and nothing hurried , this time it was a real kiss ; had Ek Ahau had decent manners itP91would have been a long one , but that black devil , growing restless , tore them apart . Favia said rather faintly , I must find Felipe . Go with God  --  and  --  and come back . ' Then she was off at a gallop . Esteban simply sat.  | THAT kiss remained with Esteban all the way to Olintlan , the memory of it carried him through his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as his life became well-filled with novelty and work , his concept of his career as a quest which should some day , somehow , bring him to Favia , receded into a background for this present business of living . The military end of it was simple ; he quickly learned the drill and procedure , his sergeant relieved him of responsibility . He turned up for parade and inspection , and took his turns on guard at the Presidential Palace with decreasing awe of that function . Anxious to do well , he gave a good deal of thought to the men in his platoon , who came mostly from the poorest Ladino class , with a small mixture of Indians . He had had a good deal more experience than most of the officers in handling that kind of men , but the military routine and power of discipline made an officer 's problems relatively simple . Between them and the ranks stood the sergeants , through whom everything was done ; many captains and lieutenants were not even sure of the names of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remoteness . Accustomed to intimate contact with peons or hired workmen , to handlinglarge gangs effectively through a knowledge ofP93their personalities and through personal dominance , Esteban considered the military system convenient but dangerous . He did not wish to do anything bizarre , but at the same time he was determined to make his mark , and after careful study of the army regulations , and noting what an excessive amount of flogging seemed to be thought necessary in the Guardia , decided to change his policy . This was after he had become fairly sure of his standing among the officers . He cultivated his sergeant , had defaulters brought to his house for personal interviews , talked with the corporals , and , after consultationwith the sergeant , got his captain to make a number of promotions and demotions . With this he allowed no slackening of discipline . At the end of three months he had an unusual knowledge of the forty men in his troop , and his own platoon bade fair to be the best in the squadron . Tradition was too strong for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as at Uyala , be among them during the noon siesta , or round their fires at night , talking informally . His activities as a soldier , however , were overshadowedby his life as a young man exploring his first large city . He found the other officers to be a lively and friendly set , fond of horse-play and high life . They understood that he was connected with the main line of Cerromayor , and that sufficed . Although he spoke with a somewhat rustic accent  --  when he first came he pronounced soldado ' as soldao '  --  he had the manners of a gentleman . Plenty of the others showed Indian blood , his own captain , Eusebio Lara , was as dark as he . What interested them was that he rode beautifully , loved a horse , danced well , could mimic till they were weak with laughter , and had a delightful , fresh enthusiasm for the pleasures of the capital . The younger blades had a grand time showing the newcomer around until , ceasing to be a newcomer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his salary was a handicap , but he made a good deal by racing Ek Ahau , and by betting on everything that had to do with horses in general , and his friends were all liberal , as he was , whenever they had money . He learned to drink sherry , not Don Geronimo 's dry , pale beverage , but sweet , fiery Jerez de la Frontera , which he thought the most delicious drink he had ever tasted . On rare occasions they opened champagne , sweet and terrifically foamy , since they had no means of chilling it . Creme de cacao was another discovery . Esteban wondered why anyone bothered with brandy when this could be had . There were well-dressed women , not at all like Indian servant girls , some of them quite light-skinned and brown-haired . Poverty kept Esteban from making a fool of himself over more than one ; even so , some favours came to him , through his uniform , his personalcharm , and his moments of richness . These affairs in no way affected his feeling for Favia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's normal processes . Officers whose homes were in Olintlan introduced him to their families ; the houses were often moreP95magnificent and the furniture more elaborate than any he had known , but the manners and procedure were the same , with one satisfactory difference  --  that the simple ranchers of the Altos Nimangiles had looked upon him as an excellent match , and he had need of constant care , while here as a penniless lieutenant , however well connected , he was no match at all and could flirt in safety . There were horse races , bull fights , card games , bachelor parties , cock fights , formal dances , social visits , and picnics at ranches near the capital . Feeling that his social position demanded it , he pinched and scraped until he could buy what appeared to be a very handsome gold watch with a red enamel back . It caused him great satisfaction and ticked loudly , but he could usually come five minutes closer to the correct time by judging the sun or the stars than he could from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages to the fiesta at Ocotal , where they lunched from great hampers , watched the Indians dance , staged a mimic bull fight and had a splendid game of matching couplets about each other . Two of the younger men got into a fight , but their elders knocked up their swords before blood was drawn . They rode home in the late afternoon , very merry , having had a good deal to drink . Esteban took his place beside Dona Adela Calderon , a cheerful , pretty girl with whom he had been actively flirting . He felt himself to be a success with her . As they rode , she said , You must pardon me , senor . In the tumult this morning I did not catch your surname ; if you would have the goodnessDe Cerromayor , for your service , senorita . ' Thank you . You are related to Senor Cerromayor who married Dona Favia Villansuela ? ' Esteban bowed , avoiding a statement . He was realizing that his success with this girl was all his own , not at all under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of a native hut . In October there were three weeks of opera , a French company touring Central America on its way to New Orleans . Rumour immediately described an affair between President La Rada and the prima donna , assigning the other women in descending order of importance to cabinet officers and senior generals . The officers of the Guardia attended night after night ; Esteban was entranced . He spent several afternoons vainly trying to find a picture of Mozart . His group , ten in all , pooled their resources for a very special party . Captain De la Barca , who was wealthy , already had a liaison with a minor soprano , through whom he invited four of the other women , performers of small roles . The young men determined to give them a celebration of the first rank . De la Barca sent a mounted detail to the top of El Gordo volcano , whence they brought down four mule-loads of ice and frozen snow to cool the champagne in European style . An orchestra was hired , the officers ' orderlies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizable house that four of them occupied together . It was a riotous success . Champagne , sherry , malaga , creme de cacao and cremeP97de menthe flowed free , the musicians were brilliant , the officers danced and performed , Esteban did imitations , the women sang arias which had never yet fallen to their lot on the stage . Their guests spoke almost no Spanish , and few of the officers had any command of French , but that hampered them not at all , they laughed to make up for what they could not say . In the background the orderlies beat time to opera , Spanish songs , the dances of Europe , and fiery , imprompturenderings of the stamping jota Alturena . The long , bare room was thick with smoke , for all its high ceiling the air in it was hot and heavy from people and candles and liquor and perfume . Esteban sat back watching ; his contribution had left him with almost no money , he did not think it worth while to try to make an impression on these women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some one of his friends . He joked with the other disengaged men who were still standing , fed the musicians drinks , and asked for varioustunes . His quietness did what effort might have failed to do . One of the women , a real blonde and therefore frantically admired , had finally been monopolized by Lieutenant Hernandez of the infantry regiment , who grew tiresome as he grew drunker . She , looking about , saw the young man who had danced so nicely and done the funny imitations , sitting by himself listening to the now spasmodic music . She decided that she wanted him , and rose abruptly . Hernandez protested and dragged her back . Thereupon she decided that that nice-looking man over there in the red and green uni- form was the realization of her dream . She pushed Hernandez in the stomach and broke away . Esteban had been watching one of the guitar players trying to get his foot out of his instrument . He felt an arm about his neck , and suddenly the beautiful blonde was trying to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernandez slapped his face . Esteban had removed his sword for comfort ; his hand reached for the knife of old habit , but he wore it no longer . He picked up a chair , Hernandez drew his sword , men looked up and shouted , women screamed . He got in a blow with the chair , knocking the infantryman 's sword from his hand , a second swing shattered his weapon , and they closed , staggering about the room , running into things , tripping at last over the body of the unconscious Captain Lara to fall with a thud together . Esteban landed on top , and reached for a strangle hold , but seeing that his opponent had lost interest , he let go . Finding no injuries on Hernandez , and judging by his breathing that nature and liquor had taken their course , his friends laid him and Lara in a corner . Esteban returned to his blonde , who was more sure than ever that she had found her ideal . He was wakened by sunlight in his eyes , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide a bit of mirror with which he had been flashing , as a tactful way of arousing his lieutenant without entering the room . Something was wrong . Looking down , Esteban saw the golden head beside him . Coffee , ' he said , for two , and brandy . '  |p99There  is no brandy , mi teniente . ' Well , whatever you have , stupid . ' He felt shaky and his head was terrible , but he smiled , remembering . That was something , to achieve a blonde and an opera singer in one stroke , and not for money . That would be spoken of in the regiment . She looked older by daylight , and her make-up remained only in spots , but there was the golden hair and the skin , almost greenish white . Deep down inside himselfhe knew that he thought that fairness hideous , on the edge of his consciousness the word leprous ' hovered , but he would not admit it . The orderly returned , his face falsely solemn , and looking pretty seedy himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , monkey , ' Esteban said . Bring the chair over here and set that on it . Good , thanks . ' He shook the woman . She stirred , opened her eyes , said something in French , and stared about her . She said something else in French , in which he caught the familiar word cafe . Putting brown sugar and a good dose of aguardiente into the coffee , he passed her a cup . She sat up then , and smiled . They were both embarrassed by not being able to talk to each other . Esteban felt shy and unsure of himself , but reassured when she accepted a cigarette . She called him mon petit thou , and then said amigo , ' patting his hand . He dressed and washed after a fashion . Then , indicatingto her as best he could that breakfast would be served shortly , he went outside . He was tired , he would be glad when she left.  | When she came into the patio , she looked better , having her hair arranged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weary , but there was none the less style in the big hoopskirt and the low corsage . The table was set in the narrow colonnade , where it was cool and shady . The Frenchwoman took only more coffee and a little aguardiente , watching with horrified fascination while he gulped almost raw , warmed eggs . It was close to noon , and he was due shortly for guard duty . He sent the orderly out to get a carriage . Then he reflected . Some gesture was due from him , some gift fitting to the occasion . Horses she could not use , he had no money , nor anything else save his watch . Well , that was it then . He took it out , smiling , and showed her how one wound and set it with its key , a mechanical device which still impressed him . Then he handed it to her , saying carefully , For you  --  many thanks  --  my love  --  remembrance  --  tenderness . ' She took it and studied it , thinking . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with this young man , when she might have had rich ones ; she was n't sorry , he was a nice fellow , he had loved her well . It had been a delightful evening . He looked handsome now in his uniform , one would hardly know how little he had slept . She gazed about her . The patio was so small that , from where she sat , she could almost touch the nearer of the two horses , the charming ittle black one , under the shed at one end . At the other end , just behind the Altureno , was a blank wall.  |p101On  her left , across the open space , were two rooms . One was the kitchen , the other the bedroom in which , she knew , there was only the rawhide-covered bed , the one chair and tiny table , a dresser of cheap wood , crudely made , a bad mirror , and a picture of some saint . It had no ceiling , one looked up to the roof , and while she was dressing smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . To her right , she looked through the door into the tiny sala , a bare room with uneven stone flagging , a couple of jaguar skins on the floor , a crude wooden bench , one chair with cowhide seat and back . Marks of horseshoes showed clearly , where the animals were led to and from the street . It was a house of poverty . He was a handsome , penniless young soldier ; she seemed wonderful to him . The lieutenant and the opera singer  --  she saw her role and enacted it . Esteban was wishing the carriage would come , he craved to be alone . Non , ' she said , shaking her head , non . Take . I not want . This  --  remembrance  --  love . ' She went into the sala and picked up one of the jaguar skins . I take  --  remembrance . ' She continued unintelligibly in French , and then kissed him whole-heartedly . Maintenant , mon ami , carriage , my house . '  |p102HE  PAID but little attention to politics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant and active political discussion that went on in the capital , particularly when the Chamber of Deputies was in session . He observed that , just as Don Geronimo had warned him , disloyal persons walked abroad in the streets , and there were even Deputies who frankly avowed themselves to be Liberalistas . Shortly after his arrival , the Diario Altureao was suppressed for disseminating treasonable matter , and even El Imparcial was ordered one day to withhold a number from publication . He thought but little of these things , save to wonder why the government did not act more drastically against those who threatened their country 's peace and security . The first question entered his mind when he was detailed , as happened twice , to make arrests on politicalcharges . These duties were assigned to him as a result of his reputation for competence in handling his platoon ; in a way , they were an honour . He remembered that the struggle was a never-ending one , and that constant watchfulness was the price of his country'ssafety , but even so he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a quiet house , women who cried or who abused him , an apparently respectable , elderly man saying good-bye to his family , P103surrendering himself , quiet , dignified . It made him feel cheap . He reminded himself of what subversion and destruction they favoured , of how the price of their freedom was the prospect of insubordinate Indiansand the dreaded horror of a War of Castes , and he performed his duty as politely as possible . He had not expected to find Liberalistas of that class , having always understood them to be the lowest kind of bandit , demagogue and plain plunderer . It was upsetting , he had to make explanations to himself . Another disturbance to his political conception came from his own brother officers , all strong supportersof the Partido Constitucional . They took it for granted , as Esteban did , that only the one group was capable of governing the country , but , sons , nephews and brothers of the men who ruled Alturas , as many of them were , they had none of his illusions as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smartly cynical , they jested without restraintconcerning the manner in which their superiors twisted the laws and bent or ignored the constitution ; it was to them the greatest joke in the world that their party should be called constitutional . ' At first their talk seemed shockingly disloyal to him , but custom , his natural desire to imitate his companions ' sophistication , and a growing feeling that what they said was true , led him to accept and finally to imitate . It was he who first referred to a promotionor demotion in his command as an amendment to the constitution . ' He felt that his increasing worldly knowledge was steadily lessening the gap between himself and Favia , and at times he longed for an excuse to visit San Pedro Uyala , to show himself in Don Geronimo 's diningroom , and let her see what he had become . At times he wanted her desperately , remembering that kiss at the foot of Rashwitz , thinking of things he should have said and done . On the whole he enjoyed himself , and wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go on forever . His poverty was of some trouble to him , but despite it he was able to live in a house by himself , thereby securing the time to be alone which was one of his greatest necessities . He was annoyed at times by his Indian 's inability to grow a mustache .. Much more serious was the very poor prospect of promotion ; Guards officers apparently were in for life , since he had joined , there had been but two changes , when a captainin the artillery regiment made a rich marriage and resigned , and when a major in the Second Squadron was sent to command a line regiment . There were no war clouds on the horizon . About a month after his arrival he was promoted to full lieutenant , and that seemed all he could hope for . Captain Lara , his immediatesuperior , showed no signs of desiring to leave the service ; he had been in command of the same troop for four years , and seemed likely to continue there indefinitely . When the rains ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , but Favia remainedat San Pedro . Esteban paid his respects immediately . In the hacendado 's presence he lost hisP105superiority and carefully acquired insolence , instinctivelybidding for a gesture of Cerromayor approval . One reason for his loss of assurance was that , while many houses in which he had visited here eclipsed the elegance of San Pedro , so that he no longer thought of the hacienda as focus of the world 's magnificence , but rather , affected to despise it , the Cerromayor town residence in turn completely beggared anything he had ever seen save the Presidential Palace . The fine Spanishexterior , with which he was familiar , its coats of arms and intricate decorations , half Moorish , half Indian , prepared him incompletely for the enormous rooms , arched colonnades giving on well-planted patios , tapestries , brocades , pictures , and rich , dark , elaborate furniture . The first time he went there , he got lost on his way out and landed in the kitchen , where a couple of Uyala vaqueros , whom he greatly desired to impress with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes at him , had the pleasure of showing him how to find the street and then , unnecessarily , pointed out the way to the Parque Central . Don Geronimo , however , was pleased with him and said so . The men at the head of the state kept in close touch with developments in the army , particularly in the Guardia , and the Minister of War himself had spoken of the way Esteban took hold . He was invited to the house for meals a number of times , and impressedhis host by his social usage , and by the fact that he had already made friends for himself with many of the guests he met there .   Early in January El Impartial published a story of an uprising among the Tishanil Indians . Calling it an uprising was not quite correct ; they had never really been conquered , but lived , permanently insurgent , in the great Ticab jungle along the Pacific coast . Now they were on the war-path , and had destroyed outpostsaround the port of Tonala . The Guards officers discussed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the lowlands to avoid this freezing weather . ' I 'd as soon face their arrows as these hailstorms , ' he said . ' Do you think they might send us ? ' Esteban asked . ' Surely not . It 's a bad business , fighting in that jungle , many men will be killed . They 'll send a good regiment if the Sublevados threaten Puerto Ancho , but now , I imagine the 17th will go . ' ' The Cabinet wo n't scream if they suffer , ' Lara put in , and the others nodded . The 17th Cavalry was largely composed of former guerrilla rebels and bandits , who had been bought off by a place in the army . It was a useful organization , for all its members knew how to fight , and as long as they were paid , were loyal . Esteban listened and reflected . ' Is there a 17th artillery ? ' he asked . ' No , man , the only artillery is here in the Guardia , you know that  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another artillery regiment , but they 're used as infantry at present . Bandits are n't usually familiar with cannons , if that 's what you mean , so they go into the cavalry or up against a wall . '  |p107Oh  . ' He considered the matter carefully . Here was the war he wanted , with its chances of quick advancement , the road to Favia , but there was no hope of the Guardia getting into it . He was bored with the garrison life and the prospect of a colonel 's commission in his advanced old age . He paced the length of his patio to and fro till late that night , thinking . It was a gamble , of course , there was danger , and he had plenty of respect for his own life . And yet , and yet , there was that number 17 . They said there was no 17th artillery , but there must have been , back in his father 's time . It looked like fate . The thing to do was to see Don Ger6nimo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahau stamped under the shed . That 's where you belong , mi capitan , in with the bandits . ' Don Ger6nimo listened sympathetically . Esteban wished to advance himself , to make a good record , and to secure that experience without which a man could hardly call himself a soldier . The Guardia wasted a great deal of time ; beyond routine drill one learned only pleasant vices , one got nowhere . Don Ger6nimo pointed out that the campaign would be dangerous . Since I have become a soldier , senor , I expect that . ' Very well . You may not have too good a reception , there is a strong personal spirit in that regiment , they are all old friends . ' I think I can make out . Starting on a campaign will make it easier . '  |p108All  right . I shall find out tomorrow if the 17th is really to be sent , or if not , what regiment , and then if you apply for transfer , I think I can assure you it will be approved . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the green and white , mounted the bay horse , and rode to report to his new colonel . His way was through a poor section , past an open market thronged with Indians , and then along an unpaved street , where many of the houses were straw-thatched . The street crossed an open field , on the far side of which the barracks clustered around the square , stone mass of the old Presidio del Norte . The barracks were two rambling buildings , partly adobe walls with tiled roof , partly adobe-plastered boards and thatch ; the stables behind them were simplylong , irregular wattle-and-daub sheds . Here and there were scattered , small huts , mud-walled for the most part , such as one might find in any Indian village . Soldiers lounged about , some dressed , some not , women went by on various errands , there were dogs and pigs and chickens and turkeys and children , spilled miscellaneously in front of the barracks and over what seemed to be the parade ground . The guard at the Presidio door saluted him smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Colonel Ochoa , but he was bothered by the way in which the sergeant seemed to scrutinize his new uniform , and once having saluted , the men relaxed from an attitude of strict attention , as though the presence of an officer meant nothing to them . He noticed that of the ten men , only two had complete uniforms , and that they all were shabby . In that moment he keenly regretted the finery and neatness of his old command . Then the corporal returned , and he was shown in . Colonel Ochoa was dark , small , and wiry , having very keen eyes , and a prominent jaw emphasized by a large mustache . His hands , resting on the table before him , were large for his size . He wore a uniform coat , unbuttoned , over a scarlet shirt , striped charro trousers , and sandals , and he needed a shave . He looked Esteban over as he rose , and he , too , seemed to take in the neat , complete uniform with some contempt . Teniente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have here the notice of your transfer . ' He raised a sheet of paper between his big thumb and forefinger , rattled it , and let it drop . Esteban saluted . At your orders , mi coronel . I beg to report for duty . ' Sit down , young man . ' The colonel spat towards the door with magnificence , eyed Esteban coldly , cleared his throat , and spat again . Frankly , teniente mio , I am surprised that you should leave the  --  ah  --  Guardia Presidencial for this poor and undistinguished regiment . ' The unaffected , slurred accent of the country-bred Altureno fell gratefully on Esteban 's ears , and he slipped back into it almost with a sense of relaxation as he answered . Truth , sinor , the Guardia was not for me . I am  --  P111was  --  a vaquero , no more . I live on my pay . I twiddledmy thumbs among those gentlemen , and got bored . I saw no chance of doing better . Then I heard a rumour that the 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , " ' Stebanico , " I said , " there is thy regiment for thee . " So I asked for a transfer , and they let me go without protest . Y aqui ' stoy , pues . ' The colonel nodded . ' Vaquero , eh ? Can you throw a rope ? ' ' I can , and a knife , and I 'll ride any horse you show me . ' ' Aha , un pelao . Let 's see . ' He rose again . ' Come along . ' At the door the sergeant was sent for a lariat . ' Is that your horse ? ' Ochoa asked . ' How many have you ? ' ' Two , sinor . ' ' Do you want to trade ? ' ' A horse trade and a marriage are always possible . Let me see your animal . ' The colonel smiled . When the sergeant returned , he said , ' Mount , and catch me that pig . ' Esteban took off his hat and sword , made fast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without touching stirrups . The bay horse , grown used to army life , shied once at the loop whirling near its head , then got down to business . A pig is hard to rope at best . Esteban was by no means sure of himself as he loped towards the animal , which continued rooting tranquillywhile he drew near . A rifle bullet , landing just behind it , startled it into a dead run across Esteban's course . He measured , whirled his loop again , threw , and swung his horse hard to the left . The rope by good fortune landed across the pig 's neck , under one foreleg and over the other ; the pig 's own speed threw it into a splendid somersault . Esteban loped back to the door , his prize dragging on its back behind him , squealing to raise the dead . The colonel and the guard were laughing , the shot and the squealing had brought soldiers out of the barracks , who questioned each other and gesticulated , a couple of officers came running over . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Esteban saw that they mistrusted him , felt that he was not their kind , might perhaps be a government spy , and he suspected that in this regiment the Cerromayor name was against him . The officers withdrew , and the colonel turned to him again . You will find some suspicion here , young man . We are all self-made men , and we expect a companion to prove himself . We march the day after tomorrow , so you must get ready . Do you want quarters ? Have you an orderly ? Are you  --  ah  --  living alone ? ' Esteban decided that he had best sink himself into the regimental life . I need quarters , sinor . I also need an orderly , for I would not bring that guardsman I had . I am alone , just now . ' Good . I like you . Just remember to stand on your own feet . That is our strength , here in the 17th . I myself began as a small farmer , then I was a plain bandit . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wrong side , then a fugitive . I served asP113a sergeant under Carrera in Guatemala ; it was pure luck and heaven 's grace that I did n't enlist in the army of Los Altos . Then I was a muleteer again , and finally I became an independent revolutionary . So then they offered me this commission , and I had to learn to read and write . I can sign my name without stopping , see ' He demonstrated , with a flourish . All my men and I know that we must die some day , and barring death , no matter how low we fall , there is a chance to rise again . And that is why , in transferringfrom the Royal Guard ' ( he emphasized the word Royal ) to here , you have come to the only other regiment in Alturas that gets its pay on the dot . ' The more I hear , truth , the more I am pleased with my choice , mi coronel . ' Colonel Ochoa clapped his hands . A corporal enteredand saluted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some chairs , hammock , cooking pots , a few clothes , an extra saddle  --  you know . ' He told the corporal , Ask Captain Horta to come here , and get four men and a wagon to go with the sinor teniente . ' Turning to Esteban , he went on , There are various of those houses vacant , you can take your pick . They 're in need of repairs , but they 'll serve you for tomorrow . ' Very well , sir . ' Captain Horta was large , plump , and bearded . Had it not been for the expression of his eyes , one would have taken him for almost any small , prosperous , middle-aged rancher . ' Here is your new subaltern , mi capitan . I commend him to you for a fine fellow . ' ' Juan Horta , to serve you . ' ' Esteban de Cerromayor , at your orders . ' ' Was it you who caught that pig ? ' ' Yes , sir . ' ' That was well done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your former regiment ? '  |p114'It  looks ever so much better to me , I hope I shall prove suitable . ' The colonel interrupted . ' He is going for his goods now , and will take a house . He needs an orderly , one who can cook , as the lieutenant is alone . Pick me one who has a regulation coat , if you can . Will you be so good as to see to that ? ' ' Very well , sir . ' ' You see , ' Ochoa explained , ' I feel that an officer 's orderly should have at least the correct hat and coat . The trousers really do n't matter  --  ' he glanced down at his own , and smiled  --  ' but he should wash his feet . A little elegance of mine , but I insist on it . Of course , if you can afford to buy him shoes -- 'Not I , sinor . ' Esteban laughed . ' Besides , a mozo is happier in sandals . ' ' True . ' The corporal came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have the orderly waiting at the third house from the left , which he recommendedas having a sound roof . Esteban took his leave . Back at his old house , he belted on once more thep115familiar , long knife , having noticed that was the rule in his new regiment , and changed his baggy , military trousers for a more practical pair of his own , tightfittingfrom the knee down , with a wide , tarnished silver stripe . On his way back to the barracks , he stopped to sell his watch , getting about half what he had paid for it ; it seemed a final gesture committing him to the new life . He put part of the proceeds into a keg of San Lazaro , a bottle of aguardiente , two bottles of sherry , a string of garlic , a new , ixtle-fibre lariat , and a coffee pot . Reverting to his old ways with peons , he gave each soldier a drink of aguardiente , measured out into a cup . They took it in the customary manner , lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw no sign of an orderly in front of his new house , but as he entered the door a cloud of chickens flew at him , with tremendous noise . Behind them a chunky , bright-looking young Indian came shooing and waving his arms . Esteban let the birds pass . The man came to attention and saluted . What is your name ? ' Pedro , sinor teniente . ' Well , Pedro , help these men unload . ' One moment , if you please , mi teniente , there is a little matter of a pig . If the others would help me ' Pedro 's Spanish was so bad that Esteban was immediatelytempted to speak to him in Rashti , but he thought it might be good policy to keep his knowledge of that language secret . He sent the others in , and the matter was adjusted with much shouting , swearing , laughter , and squeals . Ek Ahau was tied to the tail/board of the wagon , and as the pig came out , he reared back and broke loose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regiment , before Esteban got a rope on him . In this way he met many more officers without formality . When the horse was caught and tied up in the shed , he invited all hands for a drink , with the result that the furnishing of his house became a social event . By the time the bugle blew for evening parade , and he took his post with his troop , the ice was well broken . At supper , to which he brought his keg of San Lazaro , he met the rest of the officers . They looked much like any gathering of ranch foremen , save that they were harder , more competent , and more independent . He liked them , and though they were still watching him , he felt that they were inclined to accept him . The next day was a busy one , overhauling the equipment , seeing that all the men were properly armed , packing gunpowder for mule transport , gathering what food the colonel felt they needed , over and above the War Office supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some perplexity , that of the eighteen men in his platoon , only twelve had horses , and there were no spares . That 's all right , friend , we 'll attend to that on the march . Or we may turn into infantry , who knows ? This regiment was artillery until it lost all its guns at Cerro Caido . ' At Cerro Caido ? ' Yes , this is one of the oldest regiments in the service , formed in ' 23 at the very birth of independence  --  six years older than the Guardia Real , truth . ' And it used to be artillery ? ' Yes . We have the first roster still , but  --  ah  --  the handwriting is so bad I ca n't read it . ' Might I see it , sinor ? I think I had a relative in the 17th Artillery , but I did not know this was the same . '  |p117Go  and look . My secretary has it in the office . ' The secretary , a dried-up little civilian with a lawyer'spassion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated before he began to turn the leaves . It was an old and badly torn copy book , prepared by the Dominicans , with religious mottoes at the tops of its pages . Here was the date , Santiago de Compostella , Republica de Alturas ( antiguamente Reyno de la misma ) , 14 Junio de 1823 , ' and then the names of the officers . The original enlisted strength had been three hundred twenty-four , the names of the men written in a clear hand , but with strange spellings that argued one not too familiar with the pen . He read along  --  Esteban , Esteban Lucero , Esteban Chicoy , Esteban Gomez , Esteban Cruz , Esteban Carrera , Esteban Perez . Against that name , the first recorder had written canonigo , ' then a more educated hand had crossed that out with an exclamation point , and written artillero , ' there followed a notation , sargento , 23 Abril 1824 , ' and again , on the same line , written hurriedly and without date , muerto . ' That was he , Esteban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have three names . He smiled . I am Esteban Perez y Bagil , alias De Cerromayor.  | He put the roster down , thanked the secretary , and returned to his duties . His father assumed a real existenceto him , although still very vague . He cherished no illusions about either muleteers or sergeants , but he would like to see this man just once , give him an accounting . He belonged in part to him , whom he had always ignored , and he wondered what had made him join the Revolution on that first day , what made his mother follow him when the regiment passed through Tsakche . At any rate , now he knew his father 's name . He went to bed that night feeling happy and pleasantlyexcited at the prospect of action . After the nervoussocial strivings of the Guardia , the mistresses who gave prestige and consumed all one 's money , the constantsense that knowledge of his origin might undo him , this place was like coming home . No one cared for those things here . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the road to Favia , at last he was getting somewhere . He prayed for his father and mother and for her before he turned in , and lay long awake in bed , smoking , listening to his orderly'ssnores , and dreaming of battle.  | THEY were under arms before dawn . The officers gathered about a fire in front of the Presidio , where they were joined by Colonel Ochoa , his secretary , and General Calderon , the Chief of the General Staff . Ochoa informed them briefly of his orders . The Tishaniles were active at various points on the edge of the jungle , raiding , and were besieging Tonala , where there was a garrison of about thirty soldiers and armed civilians . Non-combatants had escaped on board a North American vessel which had cleared from there the day the trouble started , and put in at Puerto Ancho . The 17th would enter the Ticab at Vado Colorado and proceed directly through the jungle , following the camino real , to Tonala . Having raised the siege there , they would march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with a columnof two hundred infantrymen from Puerto Ancho under Major Rosas . The frigate La Libertad was now fitting out , and would meet them with supplies at Tonala . When he had finished , General Calderon stepped forward to address them . ' Gentlemen , in the name of His Excellency the President , I wish you Godspeed . We look to you to tame these heathen , murderous savages . The blood of your compatriots , men , women ,   and children , calls out to you . Go with God . i Viva la Republica ! ' Ochoa answered , i Paz y libertad , viva la Repu-blica ! ' The others echoed him , and the men took up the cry , a long roll of i vivas ! while day was breaking , and roosters crowed above their shouting . Esteban felt his throat catch . To your posts , gentlemen . ' The bugle called its signal , the line began to move . Passing the general , they saluted . Esteban saw the line before and behind him , four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing . In the rear followed the mule trains and noisy wagons , and the women , some carrying babies , or big bundles , some driving pigs or chickens . Up in front they began to sing , the song caught down the line , troop by troop , ribald and gallant . They were starting to war in the morning . He longed with an aching longing to have Favia see him . After about half an hour they halted to tighten girths and adjust packs . Esteban 's sergeant , Diego Chirom , bent low in the saddle to stare into a clump of trees on the right , where there seemed to be a house , called to a couple of men , and galloped over before his lieutenant could speak . There were loud voices , protests , and a great deluge of curses . Then they returned , leading a fair horse and a pretty good mule , both saddled . The sergeant saluted. teniente , I beg to report that I have requisitionedtwo mounts . '  |p121A  light dawned in Esteban 's mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue them . ' The bugle sounding officers ' call , Esteban loped to the head of the line . When they were all gathered , the colonel spoke to them . Gentlemen , the good God knows when those sailors will manage to leave Puerto Ancho . There is no food for our number at Tonala . Therefore , nothing in the wagons or on the mules is to be touched , on pain of death . We must forage as we go . Moreover , fifty of our men are unmounted , we have no remounts , and wagons will not travel along that camino real beyond Vao Color-6o , so we urgently need twenty-five more pack-animals . Not burros , they 're no good in mud . We are in for a tough fight , I hope you have all two pistols . I recommend you all to get rifles , if you have none . No breach of discipline will be tolerated . Inspect arms daily , a flogging for a dirty rifle or a rusty sword . Tell your men . We breakfast at Santa Ana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fan before and around the column , collecting food of all kinds . Horses and mules of uneven quality were brought in . They marched , noisy , good-natured , rapacious , in haphazard formations , yet always under control ; a single bugle call sufficed to bring them to order . The regiment was like its colonel , apparently careless , slovenly and without attempt at command , actually under rigid discipline and competent after a manner evolved from long ex- perience , suitable to the nature of the country , the type of warfare , and the character of the personnel . Esteban found himself soft after seven months in the city . By the end of the first day , when they halted at Nueva Sevilla on the Rio Gordo , he was stiff and tired , but there was so much going on that he hardly noticed it until he climbed into his hammock . Those five days to Vado Colorado were full of incident and instruction . Concealing his knowledge of Rashti , he was among his men as much as possible , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , mostly Indians whose lives had been adventurous , they were at once tough and naive , he felt that he could count on them in a fight . In this regiment it was possible to converse with them informally on the march or during rest periods , the relation was much what he had known as an overseer , respectful , obedient , yet free-spoken . He liked them , and they him . Of them all , he was most impressed by Sergeant Chirom , a man a few years older than himself , with wide , deepset eyes , big firm mouth and a broad face the lower part of which projected in a slight muzzle while his jaw narrowed in a fine sweep to a square chin . Pure Indian , he had acquired in his varied life somethingof Ladino humour and dash ; he was intelligent and steady , and carried out orders obediently but with common sense . During these days he studied Esteban , giving his approval and respect in measure as he became convinced of the new officer 's worthiness . Although their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked all his brotherP123officers save only Major Urriaga , a man who struck him as pompous and too boastful . He heard more Liberalista sentiments voiced favourably in those five days than in all his life before . With frank cynicism , these men thought the government rotten and its republicanforms a farce , but also that most governments were so , and , being men independent of class and caste , admired the mano fuerte , the strong hand , and followed their own interests . As he got to know Colonel Ochoa better , he understoodas never before why it was that in times of unrest regiments were likely to follow their commanders , rather than the flag . He became attached to his own captain , Horta , who , for all his plumpness , was very much of a man , concealing under lazy humour a real love of battle . They passed through Nueva Sevilla , Quezalzinco , and Petenango , like a swarm of good-natured locusts . From the last city they entered the real , steamy Tierra Caliente , where fence-posts sprouted and becamebushes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , and misty-fronded ferns grew thirty feet high . These lowlands were new to Esteban , and he did not like them . The horses lathered profusely . The next morning after leaving Petenango he could have cried when he saw blood streaming down Ek Ahau 's neck from the bite of a vampire bat . Till nearly noon , wisps of mist hung between the trees , the scattered fields seemed oppressed by the rank , aggressivegrowth around their edges , houses were shaky , momentaryaffairs of ragged palm leaves . It looked as though men had entered this country in a moment of desperation , stayed for a time , and were already in retreat . He understood well enough now why the women lamented when debt-bound Indians were marched from the mountain villages to work off their obligations in the lowland fincas . Vado Colorado was a straggling group of three hundredhouses on the Rio Ventoso . Around a plaza which was no more than a muddy field stood a stone church , a cabildo painted blue , red and green , the cuartel , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town comprisedhuts , some without walls , fruit trees and little patches of corn . At the western end of the main street the bank pitched away steeply to the brown river , sluggish and fairly low now that the rains were over . Above the red scar of the farther bank rose the jungle , a lofty wall , green , intricate , steamy , broken at one point by a tiny , overshadowed clearing where were three huts , deserted since the trouble began . The garrison , twelve soldiers and a score of ill-armed militia under a malarial lieutenant , welcomed them joyously . The whole place had been living in terror of a night attack . Tishanil Indians had been seen on the edge of the jungle , they had heard drums , and this very morning a far-flying , silent arrow had landed near the sentry on duty at the river 's edge . While the men made camp in the plaza , and the orderlies hunted for officers ' quarters , there was a council in the cuartel . The lieutenantdescribed latest developments , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Colonel Ochoa cut him short , addressing the lieutenant.  |p125How  are these militia armed ? ' ' Some have muskets , mi coronel , but we are short of balls ; some have spears and machetes . ' ' How many have muskets ? ' Eight men . ' How many of these are matchlocks ? ' Four . The men keep a lighted cigar on hand . ' Ochoa spat . ' Hots many canoes have you ? ' Six fairly large and ten small . ' ' Are there any across the river ? ' ' No , sinor , but those Tishaniles can makeDismiss the militia . Sinor Alcalde , put every man in this town to making canoes , the largest possible . Understand , Vao Colorao is now under martial law , and any man failing in his duty will be subject to military discipline . ' ' Very well , Sinor Coronel , right away . ' Mi teniente , where is this crossing ? ' From the bottom of this street , sir , over to that clearing yonder . Horses need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle . ' ' You have men over there ? ' ' Oh no , sir . I have concentrated here in case of attack . ' Colonel Ochoa heaved a deep sigh . Teniente Martinez , that clearing is of strategic importance . If the Indians should occupy it , God knows how we could cross . Captain Leon ! ' ' Here , sir ! ' ' Take your company and string it along the river bank to cover the passage . Teniente Martinez , you will proceed at once with your whole garrison to occupythat clearing . Take food for four days . Enlarge the clearing . Place outposts well into the jungle . CaptainLeon will send four men with you to bring back the canoes in which you cross . If attacked , I expect you to fight . ' Martinez looked pathetically at him , but the colonel , angry , was no man for him to face . He saluted . Very well , mi coronel . ' When he was gone , Ochoa sat down . Santisima Maria , gentlemen ! If that son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Now then , lances will be no use to us , we shall leave them all here . Captain Leon will remain with Troop B , and command this post , being responsible for communicationsfrom this end . We 'll just leave that idiot alone until near sunset , to teach him something , and then Captain Valera , you will cross over with your troop and see that we have a secure area in which to land . Better take at least four days ' food ; if you ca n't find enough , you may draw on the commissariat . I expect the rest of the regiment to live off the town while we 're here . Are there any men still unmounted ? No ? Good . We seem to have enough pack-animals . That big house on the corner is a fonda , I understand , we 'll sup there . Now go find your quarters , we may be here several days . ' The sight of the Ticab jungle , the story of the arrow , plans actually contemplating action , made Esteban tingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p127cam|ped  more or less in troop formation , had their fires started , the soldaderas were coming back with food or beginning to cook . He found his own soldiers cheerful , and full of small jokes , frankly disliking the prospect of the jungle , but sure of giving the infidel , brute savages a lesson . He felt their dependence on him ; of them all , only Sergeant Chirom seemed to trust primarily in himself . A corporal and drummer came by , announcing a general order . Captain Leon was Comandante de la Plaza , his patrols had orders to shoot anyone who disobeyedor resisted them . The inhabitants of the district would bring supplies to the comandancia , all individual stealing or requisitioning was forbidden . Drunkenness of soldiers , officers , or civilians would be severely punished . They went on through the village , the drum and the monotonous , cadenced voice of the corporal growing fainter , then louder again as they completed their circuit . The man drew out final vowels into a long , rather cheerful wail with a rising note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la parte de soldAos , oficialeso particulares ' sta terminamente prohibido-o-o ! ' The officers supped together at the fonda . Its proprietorwas a small , ugly man , tipsy , with the lack of enjoyment of a man who is always so . His chief characteristicswere a scraggly , pepper-and-salt beard and small , angry , bloodshot eyes . He was obviously displeasedat having to feed some forty good eaters who would probably not pay him . They were serious at first . Between mouthfuls Ochoa spoke of the peculiarities of jungle warfare , and they listened with attention , although to many of them it was familiar . He went into the marching order which they had been practising , and the special drills to be held during the next few days . The men should fight in twos , one to shoot and one to hold his fire for the rush that would come after ; each officer must see to it that his men were paired . The whole Tishanil fighting strength was not over five hundred , perhaps less ; some were besieging Tonala , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being diverted by the column from Puerto Ancho . For the first few days the regiment need not expect to meet anything like equal numbers , but there would be ambushes , night attacks , picking off of stragglers . The policy must be always to assume the offensive . They listened carefully , visualizing this warfare in eternal mystery and twilight . Esteban looked at the grave , dark faces , and the women , in whose silence one could read many things . Others who had fought in the jungle added counsel , towards the end of the meal they were off on general reminiscences of battle , and the whole tone became cheerful . Esteban 's attention kept wandering to the servant girl , a young Conapena Indian . He had been only once to Conap , but the pure , Highland type called to him , who was feeling homesick , and oppressed by the hot , heavy night ; she was like a breath of cold air and the scent of pines . He noticed her as he would not have done ordinarily , details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking , as some Indian women are , with small features and an oval , P129moderately broad face , and she had that same look of immovable , internal strength which had characterized his mother . Her hair was drawn tightly back , done in two braids , and the braids , each wrapped in a red , yellow and green ribbon , brought around her head to form a sort of turban , with a tassel hanging over each ear . The arrangement set off nicely the poise of her head and slender neck . She wore the Conapena huipil , a rectangle of dark blue cotton with a hole in the middle for her head , covering her elbows on either side and sashed in at the waist . Across the shoulders , extending two hands ' breadths down the front and back , was a close design of embroidery , dark red , yellow , light blue and green . Her blue sash had narrow , widely spaced stripes of the same colour . The wide huipil , coming in to the tight sash , emphasized her slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching to just below her knees . Her forearms and hands , her legs and feet , were delicately made , and golden brown . He noticed it all , item by item , as she moved about the room . She looked unhappy ; when her employer or his wife spoke to her , their words were harsh . Esteban thought , You and I do not belong here . Let me saddle up and put you behind me , and we shall go back to the Highlands where it is reasonable to live . The table being cleared , she left the room . His attentionreturned to the talk of war , and in its fascinationhe forgot his homesickness . They broke up early , Ochoa remarking that they would need their sleep ; but for a long time Esteban lay awake in his hammock , smelling the strange , hot country smells , listening to the patrols go by , thinking of battle and wondering how he would act . The next day was one of mounting excitement , with manoeuvres in thickly wooded sections , another troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment to follow , and the necessary canoes beginning to arrive . By lunch time Esteban was in a state borderingon exaltation , he assumed an air of gravity and great importance , spoke tersely , and walked rapidly . Going to lunch , his way took him by the side entrance which gave on the fonda 's compound . As he passed it , he heard curious sounds , scuffling feet and a halfchokedcry . Thinking some soldier must be up to mischief , he pushed open the gate . Under a shed on one side , the landlord was wrestling with the Conapena , trying to throw her down on a bench . Her hair was disordered , and her skirt half torn off . His rare anger surged up in him , sending him forward at a leap , with his knife drawn . He did not seem to touch the ground , but floated through a red glow towards the man . The frightened , drunken face , the spasm of terror as his knife point just pricked the skin , brought Esteban to his senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . He began to feel a little bit of a fool . The man started cursing him . ' Get into the house before I kill you . ' Still swearing , and stumbling slightly , the landlord obeyed . The girl had collapsed on the bench , her clothingall disordered . Esteban turned to her , feeling embarrassed , not knowing what on earth to say . Ochoa 's voice called sharply ,  | Look out , look behind you ! ' He whirled in time to see the landlord in his doorway , aiming a musket . The big hammer rose and swung with appalling slowness , the old gun delayed fire for an instant , just the fraction of time that enabled Esteban to throw himself on one side . He heard the report , the snap of the ball passing him , its thud as it landed against the compound wall . Faster than he himself could think of it , though he did not seem to move fast , his hand spun the knife , taking it by the blade , his arm rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , slender and bright , turning over in mid-air . As its point came forward it plunged , slanting downwards , and struck . He saw the man drop his gun , heard it clatter loudly on the threshold , and wondered if it were damaged . He saw the hands go up , fumblingly , to touch the hilt . He heard the long sigh as the man slowly went limp , sank to his knees , collapsed forward , head-down over the doorstep . There was no more excitement , he was tired and sick . Ochoa cried , Well done , friend , well done ! ' Esteban looked stupidly at him , and at Horta , who stood smiling , just behind the colonel . Ochoa asked , Is that your first ? ' He nodded . You do n't look as if you wanted lunch , truth . Well , it 's clear self-defence ; if the man is n't dead he 'll be hung . Go to your hut , put yourself under arrest , place a guard at your door , take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . '  | The colonel came to his house about an hour later , to find Esteban still shaky , but somewhat cheered by the " thought that he had shown himself to be quick in action . Ochoa was cheerful and brisk . Let 's have a drink , my boy . That 's better , salud ! All is well , the alcalde has apologized , the man is dead . Here is your knife , by the way . ' Esteban took it gingerly . Tell me , teniente mio , what started it ? Are you making love to the girl ? ' No , sir . I just heard a noise and walked in , and he was attacking her . It made me angry ; the poor girl , so far from home . I chased him off . I 'm glad I killed him . ' Ochoa studied him . My boy , have n't I heard some story about you ? Who was the relative you looked for in the roster ? Excuse me asking , I speak in friendship . ' Esteban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my father , Esteban Perez , a sergeant killed at Cerro Caido . In private life he was a muleteer , and pretty nearly an Indian . My mother was Serafina Bagil , a Cuistlaquena ; I was born in this regiment . She rescued Don Geronimo Cerromayor in that battle , when he was wounded . Don GerOnimo reared me , hence the name I use . Usually I pass for his  --  son . I spoke Rashti before I did Spanish . I '  --  he raised his head and looked straight at Ochoa , speaking in a dull , level voice  --  I am an Indian . ' Ochoa grunted . Better men than you have been Indians , ' he said roughly . Do n't let me hear you say it like that again . Think of your patriot father andp133your brave mother , think of what you are going to accomplish , and say proudly , " I am an Indian . " ' Esteban smiled feebly . Do as I say . Brace your shoulders , man . There now , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an Indian . ' The young man choked . Well , that 's better . Morelos was an Indian , the President of Guatemala is an Indian . You know that , do n't you ? Well , let 's have another drink . ' Esteban poured for them both , and Ochoa spat beforeraising his glass . ' I remember that story ; you 've been a sort of a monument to Don Ger6nimo , eh ? ' The gratitude of the lion for the mouse . ' The colonel nodded . You 'll get over it , you 've got the stuff . Just make up your mind to be what you are . I 'm grateful to your parents for a good officer , but I wish she 'd let that old devil rot . This would be a freer country today if he had n't spent his time undoing what they fought for . ' These last words did not even surprise Esteban ; everything , himself included , was too bewildering . Well , what 's done is done . I worried about all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier , and do n't think . Let 's have another drink . By God , you have a quick hand with a knife . Salud , and crooked arrows to the Tishaniles . ' Salud , pues . The knife was out of my hand before I 'd made up my mind to throw it . I surprised myself . ' You 're a man of action . ' The guard challenged outside , they heard a woman's voice . One of the soldiers came in and reported that an Indian woman was here to see the lieutenant . Ochoa said , ' Bring her in , ' and retired , smiling , to the darkest corner . The Conapena entered , stooping under a bundle in a carrying-net . Easing the tump-line from her forehead , she straightened , saying , ' I go with you . ' ' Oh no ! ' was all Esteban could manage . ' You have your woman , then ? ' ' No , but you ca n't come with me . ' She swung her bundle to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight for me , and upon me to follow you . ' Her tone was quiet and final . ' You must go back to the Highlands , to Conap , where there is snow now , and pine trees . ' ' Why , then , was I sent here ? Why have these things happened ? I am for you . ' Esteban felt as if he were trying to stop the marchof the seasons , the succession of day and night . ' We go into the jungle to fight . I may be killed to-morrow . ' ' Without me , who will mourn for you ? Who cooks your food ? ' ' My orderly . ' ' Your orderly ? Can he grind corn then , can he cook tortillas , that man ? Can he carry burdens ? Will he mend your clothes ? Look , your hammock is torn . It is intended . ' Ochoa interjected from the corner . ' Take her and save trouble , man . You could do worse . ' P135Esteban sighed . ' What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . ' It was a trap , his father had captured him . All that remained now was for him to become a sergeant , and the cycle would be complete . P136AT DAWN they started crossing , a complicatedbusiness with laden canoes , mounted men racing up and down stream to head off drifting pack-mules , animals being rounded up on the far side , a mule baulking on the bank , a woman trying to keep a turkey quiet as the canoe pushed off and a frantic civilian on the bank claiming the bird as his property , orders and troop formations and women and fractious animals . After the noon meal they began to march along the narrow , green-walled alley of the camino real , ready for trouble , nervous at first and oppressed by the strange , green light that came through the massed leaves overhead , and the choking growth on either hand that rarely allowed one to see more than a few score of yards . As planned , Captain Horta 's troop took the lead , the two platoons about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the main body . Horta took the first platoon , over Esteban 's protest . I know jungle warfare , and you do not , ' he said ; as to danger , so long as I die in action , I do n't care when it happens . ' They marched through the long , hot afternoon , ducking under lianas and low branches , dodging thorns , quiet at first , later noisy and cheerful as hourP137after hour , nothing happened . When a troop of monkeysfollowed them for a league , they disputed all along the line as to whether the animals were Sublevados or only infantrymen . Just at sunset they reached the water-holes and little clearing of El Jato . The open space was too small for the regiment , but the sun went down before the rear guard came in , and then the jungle was pitch black . Men with torches cut narrow paths radiating into the forest , so that a ring of sentries could be placed around the camp . The posts were like holes cut in solid darkness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be able to see the bole of the tree nearest him , or some one star through the leaves overhead , he would listen to the constant rustling and creaking noises , little scurryings , hear a jaguar mewing , and then with a start of fright see a brilliant green light just before his eyes , only to recognize it as a phosphorescent beetle . Time and again some panicked sentry fired at nothing , and the whole camp woke . Nobody slept well , Esteban least of all , for on top of everything else was the annoyance of Marta , quiet but still there , her mat beside his . At dawn , as everybody was moving about and beginning to shed their nervousness now that they could see , there was a sudden outcry from one side . Esteban hurried over and had to elbow his way through an excited group . There on the ground a soldier lay , still in the position of sleep , comfortable , with his head pillowedon his arm and his blanket over him . Out from his back projected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , and a frightened man was telling how he woke at reveille to find it beside him . Ochoa came up on the other side . ' Carramba , ' he said , those brutes ! Well , there 's something to think about for breakfast . ' In the latter part of the morning they reached a place where the trail dipped to a slough at the bottom . Horta sent men through the bush on each side . They saw figures moving , opened fire , and a flight of arrows hissed through the leaves . Apparently no harm was done on either side . About mid-afternoon the corporal on point duty flung up his hand , cried out , and fell , with an arrow sticking out of his side . Then the rain of shafts began . The men dismounted and took their positions admirably . Esteban shouted , Keep in twos , keep in twos ! ' resisting a desire to wince and guard his eyes . Rememberinginstructions , he called i Adelante ! ' and plunged into the forest wall . Everything seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw him vanish , and took cover . He called again , Keep in pairs ! ' It grew quiet in front . He could see most of his men , some of them looked at him , and he forced himself to grin . Sergeant Chirom ! ' he called . Here , sir , ' from the left of the line , a low , cool voice . All right , get ready to advance . Ready , mucha-chos ! ' As he raised his voice , a handful of arrows landed around him , several of his men fired . Someone had been hurt and was making a lot of noise . The arrows began falling fairly steadily , and there were some menp139on that side , too , with firearms . Troops were coming up behind him . As he rose , Captain Montes said in his ear , Buenas tardes , friend . It 's hot . Let 's go . ' They advanced , running and stumbling in the thick brush . Now they could see the enemy , and begin to yell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sublevados disappeared . Now as they paused , Esteban could hear the roll of fire all along to his left . The shots died away , and the bugle sounded recall . Colonel Ochoa met him in the trail . Good work up here . Hello , Captain , ' he nodded to Montes , where 's Horta ? ' A soldier saluted . He 's dead , mi coronel . Here they come with him . ' Two soldiers and a woman approached under the tree-ferns , walking heavily as they supported the limp bulk . Ochoa , Montes , Esteban , took off their hats . Ochoa spat . Set him down . My poor friend  --  we fought and marched together these many years , gentlemen . May God receive his soul . ' Amen . ' Amen . ' Amen , ' said the soldiers standing near , but the soldadera , kneeling , began to wail . Silence ! ' Ochoa shouted . None of that . You can mourn all you like at Tonala . ' He added in a lower tone , You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Si , sinor. '  | ' I hereby promote you to captain . My secretary will make out the papers this evening . How are your men ? ' Esteban looked at them as they stood by their horses or lounged in the saddle , watching the last of the wounded being carried to the rear . His eyes met Chirom 's , and they both half smiled . How about it , boys ? ' he asked . A man up ahead said in a deep voice , i Mueran los selvajes ! ' The whole line murmured assent . Ochoa nodded . Soldaos , I am proud of you . You will continue as advance guard , but you , mi capitan , will stay with the second platoon . ' He began to smile . You are now the youngest captain in the regiment , ' he said in a low voice , his smile broadening , and you an Indian ! ' Esteban smiled and blushed . I should like to dismountmy men , sir , and send the horses to the rear , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't I say we 'd end up as infantry ? ' They marched again . Esteban thought about a dead Tishanil he had seen , naked save for his breech-clout , with long , stringy hair fallen over his face , the nose more aquiline , the lips heavier , but still not much unlike other Indians . The man 's head rested on his arrows , spilt from the quiver ; their vari-coloured feathers made a fan , almost like a halo , behind his head . In about an hour , with plenty of daylight left for the regiment to make camp in good order , they reachedp141the clearing of San Antonio . In early times there had been a settlement here , a Dominican mission to the Tishaniles , and descendants of the monks ' orange trees still grew in clusters . Earthquakes had rent the little church and convent , storms torn it , and rains underminedits foundations , but most of the yard-thick walls still stood with trees growing from the tops of buttresses and bushes sprouting out of every crack . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers of the implacable forest , slowly , unceasingly , tearing at the works of man . From Vado Colorado one could look back at the Sierra Madre , one could even make out white patches of snow on the mountain-tops , but here there were only the great trees , and it had never been cool . Like his horses , he grew weary from walking so long on the level . He was so tired that he could not resent Marta , but only accepted the food she prepared for him , and was thankful of someone else to tell Pedro what to do . He did not care if she slept near him , one outflung hand extending onto his mat , or if she slept in Vado Colorado , but only that she made him comfortable and saved him thought . That night and the next day and the next night at Pozos Grandes were much alike . The Tishaniles never came to close quarters , but they were unrelenting in ambush , their arrows and occasional bullets fell from the front , from the flanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and animals . It was infuriating and depressing , one could not get at them , one seldom saw them , they seemed never to halt or sleep .   At Pozos Grandes there had been a settlement of five houses , with a wide area of cornfields . Some of the corn still stood , mouldy , but welcome as fodder . Of the houses remained only a few charred posts and rectangularareas of ashes on a little rise of ground , and a skeleton from which the ants were still collecting the last shreds of sinew . It was only four leagues from there to Tonala , and they began to pass more deserted cornfields . The troops felt cheerful , Esteban had to warn his men against carelessness . The trail took a sharp turn to the left around a huge down tree . Just at the apex of the bend was another , crossing the new trail , the growth around it still disarrangedby its collapse . They scouted carefully on both sides , found no one , and cleared away the obstacle . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bugle call , whistles , shouts , and then heavy firing . He called in his men and started back , deciding that the Tishaniles must have attacked the baggage train as it rounded the corner . He saw Valera 's troop diving into the woods to the left . Their captain , coming towards him , confirmed his guess and said , Go to the right and swing back , perhaps we 'll catch them . ' Esteban turned to his men . Here 's a chance to get our hands on them , friends , if we look sharp . ' He put them into two columns , Chirom leading one , himself the other , and started into the bush . Almost immediately they met arrows . He could hear the bowstringstwanging . He called , Come on , here they are "  |p143and  ran , regardless of thorns . The whole jungle was alive with Sublevados , it was like the first skirmish , only there were more of them , and they were standing their ground . He fired his second pistol and drew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side just in time to fend off the thrust of a long spear , knock it aside , and strike back with a fierce satisfaction . He had an impression at one time that Tishaniles were appearing directly out of the earth . He tried to hang onto the ideas of keeping together and keeping in pairs , but things happened too fast . Once he halted his command , with arrows flying all around them , put them in order , and reprimanded two stragglers . The effect on the men was excellent . They joined hands with the main body and charged together , all yelling , order lost in vegetation so thick that one could hardly see at all . Esteban found himself running after nothing , he stopped , and called in what men he could see . There were only a few shots to be heard , and the bugle calling assemble . It was all over . Did you see Urriaga ? ' Valera asked him , back on the trail . No , is he hurt ? ' Not he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree . ' i Carramba ! ' Truth . I believe it . ' The colonel rode along the line , receiving reports of casualties . Anyone could tell where he had been , Esteban thought ; his coat was torn , his face was still dripping sweat , his right hand blackened with powder smoke.  | ' How about you , my young captain ? ' he asked ; what losses ? ' Three dead and five wounded , sir . ' Ochoa nodded . ' Your flanking movement was very nice . ' A corporal stepped forward . Would the colonel care for this ? ' He held out a hardwood javelin with barbed tip . Where did you get it ? ' ' I found it in my hat , sinor . ' Many thanks . ' He turned to Esteban again , Now , seriously , I think we can proceed in peace . I take it that was the main body that has been besieging Tonala , plus our friends of the road . But keep a sharp eye out . ' An hour later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , one tree above another . As Esteban rode forward to reconnoitre , a voice called zQuien vive ? ' i Alturas 1 ' A soldier sprang to the upper log , stretching his arms high . J Paz y libertad ! ' he cried . The army ! ' A hundred feet farther on they marched out of jungle , into the wide clearing of Tonala and saw the cluster of huts silhouetted against the still , bright waters of the lagoon . The garrison came running to greet them , forty-odd men , soldiers and armed civilians , tired men suddenly grown jubilant . Captain Guzman maintained a serious formality , but his face was deeply lined and his eyes were heavy for want of sleep , and as he reported to Colonel Ochoa , saying ,  |p145You  are very welcome , ' his lips quivered . He cleared his throat , stiffened , and said with yet greater formality , I think the colonel will find everything in order . ' Ochoa leaned down to take his hand . The burden is now ours , sinor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cuartel ? ' Guzman saluted , turned smartly on his heel , and walked off rapidly , his back very straight , tears streaming down his cheeks . P146DURING the afternoon they established camp , placed outposts , and rested . The men were tired , not a few were sick , and a roll-call showed a total of eighteen combatants killed and forty-one wounded , the dead including Captain Horta and a sub-lieutenant . Early the next morning , Captain Galvez and his troop started back for Vado Colorado , to carry messagesand arrange for more supplies , as Ochoa had no confidence in the arrival of La Libertad . He took with him all animals not absolutely needed for the officers or for packing , it having been decided from there on to march and fight as infantry . Major Urriaga asked to accompany Galvez , pointing out that his higher rank would facilitate commandeering food in the towns . From his eagerness , it was easy to see that he longed to be out of the Ticab , but Ochoa told him drily that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' departure left them with three hundred and twenty effectives in the garrison . The day was quiet , save for one accurate , silent javelin , flung from within the jungle , which brought down Captain Rodriguez as he was inspecting outposts . By sunset Esteban felt that he knew Tonala by heart , fifty scrubby acres , the central and shoreward parts of which were slightly elevated , clumps of second growth , a score of houses down by the water , the whole en/closed on three sides by the irregular barrier of the jungle , massed green against the sky , pointed by the occasional bright spot of an orchid , and the huge boles of trees below , half masked by choking green , with dark spaces like windows , and brighter green of small palms . On the fourth side was the lagoon ; its water was salt , just as people said Esteban had tasted it . His house stood on piles close by the low shore , where he could hear the constant murmur of the water , and look out over the dully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall , like slow breathing , fascinated him . He would have liked to watch for hours , to have studied it from when the mists rose unwillinglyin the early morning until the water 's face was a flare of glory and the sun sank behind the outer barrier . From outside there , a mile away , wondering , he could hear the long , irregular , deep rolling of the ocean swell . The huts indicated in their arrangement two stragglingstreets running up from the shore  --  trampled runways , no more  --  a cross-street on which someone had planted a sign , still faintly legible , Avenida 14 de Junio , ' and a small plaza . On the seaward side of the plaza the combined cuartel and customs house had been built on a low , stone terrace . The terrace , and a couple of mounds between there and the church , long antedated the coming of white men ; this town had existed only since the development of the mahogany trade . The cuartel-aduana , palm-thatched and walled with sticks set not too closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opposite was the church ,  | slightly larger , with a platform in front on which was hung a big , bronze bell . Scattered through the clearing were a few shelters , storehouses for corn . Outside , in the jungle , here and there were cornfields , deserted now . No preparations had been made anywhere for this year 's planting , and even one season 's neglect made the whole place look abandoned . In and around the settlement were camped the troops and their women . A few native civiliansremained , the militiamen  --  mostly lumbermen from the mahogany camps  --  and some old people who had refused to flee when the North American vesselcleared . Farther out , the horses and mules grazed . Steamy heat and low altitude bothered them all ; the days were terrific , the nights thick and close , a warm , palpable air like soup , that filled one with restlessness after dark . Men and animals suffered from it alike . Some dysentery and malaria developed . The church was turned into a hospital , where the sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erratic assistancefrom Captain Valera , who was , as the colonel put it , an unfrocked doctor . Esteban , on an impulse which he afterwards regretted , volunteered to assist him , and having done so , stuck to it , although it meant some exceedingly unpleasanthours . They went after supper , usually accompanied by Ochoa , who would stay for a few minutes , speaking to this man and that , before returning to his duties . The big hut was badly lighted by a few torches , showing the men lying in all imaginable positionson their mats . For all the details sent in to cleanp149ups , the place stank , and by day the flies were frightful . A few of the best of the women moved about , bringing water , food , or such herbs as they knew . By one mat or another there would always be a group setting up the harrowing , cadenced mourning chant . Valera would chase them out with their corpse . Some men groaned , some complained , some , fevered , raved in Spanish or in Rashti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused him . The plaintive Indian intonation , the words coming from dark corners , phrases that suddenly evoked an upland sheep pasture or a village on the green mountain-side , tormented him . He would return to his house feeling sick and shaken . There Marta would be waiting , always quiet , always with a little food , a drink ready . She had found a pineapple growing in an abandoned plantation , and gave him its juice , she had saved limes from Vado Colorado , she always had coffee made . She did not fuss over him , but he could collapse in his hammock , knowing that Pedro would pull off his shoes and get out , that a gourd with something cool in it would be put in his hand , a ready-rolled cigarette be given him and a light held for it . What talk there was , if he wanted to talk , would be restful and unmilitary . She did not even call him mi capitan , ' but plain Esteban , ' or more often the Indian version of his name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from speaking to her in Rashti . She was like home , he came back eagerly to his house at night . They were to have set out for Chuulob on the third clay , but before dawn a terrific storm crashed down on them . The lagoon went wild , like a beast , no dawn showed behind the purple clouds , but only a weak light in which to see the thin , diagonal , white masses of the rain . Lightning flashed in sheets , the thunder was overwhelming . After a time the rain ceased , but the fury of the wind continued , the jungle tossed as if it would break loose from the earth , now and again eighty-foot mahogany giants went roaring down , bringing a dozen smaller trees with them , like the fall of a dynasty . Several houses were blown over , part of the roof went from Esteban 's . Heaven only knew how blocked the trails would be after this . Towards evening , Esteban and Marta got a couple of mats rigged up on the windward wall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it , huddled together in their blankets , shivering and wet . In the mountains they would not have thought this a cold wind , but here it pierced to their bones . Are n't you sorry you came now ? ' he asked her , after they had taken each a drink . Why do you ask that ? I am here , so are you . ' Still , you did n't need to be . ' I was meant to , just as you were . You do not like it here , neither do I. You will go on and fight and be killed , or not be killed , until it is time for you to go back . That way , then , I shall follow you . That is where Indians are wiser than Ladinos . My uncle Miguel Hunricab can make divinations . He had mules , he wanted to travel and earn money , but God made him for divinations . Indians know thatp151if he did not use it , his gift , his burden , would turn bad in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his mules , and everyone in Conap comes to him to know the truth . If he had been a Ladino , he would have fought himself about it , he would have asked a question like yours . Like that I am with you , like that you are here . ' He had never heard her say so much at once , and he was surprised by her expression of determined certainty . It occurred to him that she was thinking more than she said . What , then , would you ask if you were free ? ' he said , speaking in Spanish but with the Rashti idiom . What does your heart ask ? ' I do not know . ' She averted her face . Perhaps I know a little . ' He put his arm across her shoulders and felt her start . Come here . ' He pulled her against him , her head went down against his shoulder . He had not meant to begin this at all , he felt bewildered and slightly exalted . The wind slackened . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting the still damp blankets fall . What if I should beat you , Marta ? ' he asked . Lots of men beat their women , they need their care just the same . ' Then she laughed . She was thinking that he was no wife-beater . Esteban saw it , and knew that she was right . He buckled on his sword and went out , smiling.  |p152COLONEL  OCHOA said that La Liberlad was presumablywrecked and the trail to Vado Colorado blocked by down timber , and the only thing left was to capture Chuulob as rapidly as possible and have done with it . He left one platoon of Rodriguez ' troop with Guzman and his force at Tonala , distributing the other through the regiment , and took with him two of the lumbermen who knew the jungle , and who , while cruising for timber , had once reached the outermost farms of the Tishanil capital . Not all the women went with the regiment ; some stayed with the hospital , some waited for Galvez ' men to return , a good many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter , the Sublevados seemed to have abandoned this section , or possibly the advance from Puerto Ancho had drawn them off in that direction , for the march to San Vicente was entirely peaceful , and they had no opposition crossing the Rio Negro . It was quiet , too , the following day while they sweated and groped , single file , along a trail so narrow that the leaves on either side constantly brushed their shoulders . Then the enemy came to life again , and days and nights were all one long skirmish , sometimes fierce , sometimes just casual shots . Captains Montes and Herrera , Lieutenants Lucero , Hernandez , and Carillo were accounted for in one morning . After that the officersp153dismounted , sending their horses back to the baggage train . Esteban felt like apologizing to Ek Ahau for having needlessly dragged the little horse into such a mess . Ochoa stuck to his policy of aggressive counterattacks , the men began to grow used to jungle warfare , and they all longed to come to real grips with their enemy . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Urriaga had disappeared . After a good deal of enquiry , it turned out that he had set out for Tonala as fast as he could ride , taking with him a few men from the rear guard . The rest of that section had refused to obey when he ordered them to follow him . Ochoa looked as though he were going to swear tremendously , but finally gave up in the face of such enormity , remarking mildly , If he gets back alive , I hope to meet him again soon . ' The character of the terrain changed on the fourth ( lay , and the lumbermen said they were nearing Chuulob . The underbrush grew sparse , so that one could see for some distance between the big trees , and the soil was rocky as they climbed a long slope until at noon they reached a level . Shortly this ended in a steep descent , slippery with damp leaf mould and small , sharp limestone fragments . Here the Tishaniles were particularlyvicious , as the men stumbled and the pack-animalsfell again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought down several . The oppositionended when they reached the bottom , where they camped by a clear stream , the first really good waterp154they had seen since they left the Highlands . At nightfall , hearing distant drums and the faint , thin blowing of conch shells , they knew the capital was near , and looked forward to a real battle . At the first seeping of daylight through the trees , the Tishaniles attacked . This was no interchange of bulletsand arrows , no five-minute encounter , but a firstratefight lasting till well after daylight , charge and counter-charge and close-locked melee . The troops , well broken in by now , stuck to their formations ; of the few clear memories Esteban retained afterwards , one was his sense of delight as the even numbers of his troop fired , stepped back to reload , and then , when the savagesrushed forward , the second volley crashed dismay into them . He remembered running and shouting , and slowly growing cooler and more sure of himself , and Chirom 's magic way of always being where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plunging at their tethers , and a wounded mule screaming , Corporal Coshil sabring a soldier who turned to run , and his surprise at seeing the women right up in the battle line . Marta snatched his empty pistol from his hand and shoved a gun at him , saying , It 's loaded . ' He saw Chirom 's woman hand him a water-gourd duringa pause , and begged a drink from her , he saw two soldaderas drag a wounded man out from under the very feet of an attack . These things he remembered , and Ochoa 's voice , clear and steadying , like a man speaking to nervous horses , and a savage hacking at Valera after he was down ; but he did not remember that it was he who killed the savage . P155The bugle called them back from pursuit that would have scattered their formations , and they fell in for roll-call . A hasty reorganization was made ; of ten troops that left Olintlan , men enough for six remained with the regiment , of twenty-four officers , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uphill again , encounteringalmost no resistance ; then they came out on an uneven plateau , and began to pass clearings , cornfields and cotton and tobacco and isolated houses , with interveningspaces of fairly open jungle or thicker second growth . Scouting parties searched the buildings for food and then set fire to them . Ahead , louder and louder , they could hear the drums and trumpets . The guides said that this was as far as they had gone , just ahead lay the big clearing of Chuulob . The regiment halted while scouts were sent out , who came back shortly to report a big Tishanil army , in military formation , in the open , their centre defended by a stockade . Ochoa went up and down the line saying , At last we get at them , boys . Here 's our chance . ' The men knew well enough that defeat this far from help would mean the end of them all , and they were elated at the thought of a battle in regular style . It cheered them to take ordinary formations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted . They went forward at a fast , eager walk . The Tishaniles stood their ground in face of volley fire and flank attack , but the horsemen dismayed them and broke up their first line . They ran and rallied , fellP156back and rallied again . It was a long fight , bitter on both sides , for the soldiers were both revengeful and afraid , the Sublevados fighting for their homes and altars . Not till late afternoon was the last defender dead or vanished into the jungle . Soldiers and soldaderas began looting almost before the fighting was over . Ochoa immediately detailed Esteban to patrol the town , instructing him to bring all supplies he could find to the plaza . Order was restored , and the place put in condition for defence . It was not much of a town , perhaps twoscore nicely built houses scattered haphazard among fruit trees on a bit of high ground , around a plaza a hundred yards square . On the south side of this was a terrace , similar to the one at Tonala , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ochoa for headquarters . On the opposite side was a small , painted pyramid with a stone idol on top , flanked by stone mounds and slabs as big as a man , carven with figures . Bits of incense still burned before these images , and there were offeringsof flowers , bloody now , on the pyramid steps . The dead of both sides were scattered about the place , with buzzards already beginning to hover . Esteban had them removed for burial . He took a squad , and gathering all the women he met , searched from house to house , giving them what food he found to carry , then he brought his haul back to the comandancia . The colonel was sitting with the two guides . Well done . Sit down , friend , here 's a drink , ' Ochoa told him.  |p157Esteban  was glad to comply , for a stone-tipped lance had torn his shoulder , and while the wound was not serious , it hurt like fire . Let 's have your report . ' Esteban told what he had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , here we are . ' Esteban nodded . And so , where are we ? Where 's the column from Puerto Ancho ? And if it does n't come , how the hell do we get out of here ? We 've less than two hundred effectivesleft . Don Anastasio here '  --  he nodded to one of the guides  --  ' says we should demand hostages under threat of killing our prisoners and smashing their idols . ' We should demand some of their chiefs , ' the lumbermansaid . How do you tell a chief , and how many prisoners have we ? ' Esteban asked . Six that are likely to live , ' Ochoa told him . How about the chiefs , friend ? ' They have green stones set in their noses . ' i Carramba ! Can you talk the language ? ' Oh yes , it 's very like Rashti . ' Hearing a murmuring in the square , Esteban glanced out . Look ! ' he said . Ochoa and he went to the door . Many of the soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prayed at such shrines , grass-grown , crumblingand neglected , around their native villages ; they had just such idols hidden in caves or behind the altars of their churches . Here were their old gods , beautifully set forth in this land of strangeness , so they knelt before them as they had done at home , and as they did at home , crossed themselves in appeal to the new gods , too . Many of the men were half naked , their white cross-belts gleaming against their dark skins , all were in rags , caked with sweat and dust and often blood . It was falling dusk . Out in the jungle could be faintly heard the slow beat of drums . Ochoa nodded . Take away what the Spanish shoved onto them , the cross , trousers , the knowledge of a king or a president , and what 's the difference ? Why are these two tribes fighting ? Why do they followus ? We 've given these ones just enough to separate them , so they 'll stick to us , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , will you find that damned bugler for me ? ' All Esteban wanted was to go to his house , to Marta , who would have food for him , who made an atmosphere of peace and domesticity , who would know what to put on his shoulder to stop its burning . They had reached Chuulob , they had taken the capital , and what did it matter ? They were no nearer the mountains , Uyala was a dream , he could hardly visualize Favia . The prisoners gave varied information , but they were agreed on two points  --  , that there were many hundreds of Tishanil fighting men , and that the Puerto Ancho column had been routed several days ago . One was released with the message demanding hostages . The regiment was besieged , a man could not approach the forest anywhere without drawing arrows . No an/swer coming from the Tishaniles , a prisoner was hung , conspicuously , in clear sight of the jungle . The response to this was an unsuccessful night raid . Ochoa called another council . He pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the Sublevados to order , they were still full of fight . Aside from the two troops left behind , the regiment had lost a hundred and thirty in killed , wounded , sick , and deserted . To return to Tonala would mean more casualties , and leave them still in the jungle , still besieged , after all the lives sacrificed . Every time they had been able to attack they had been successful , and had inflictedlosses on the enemy , their only hope was in a continued offensive . From the tops of the big zapote trees in the village , one could see a big clearing in the northeast , from which all this drumming seemed to conic . Undoubtedlythe Tishaniles had established headquarters there , probably had gathered supplies and such things , so that if they could be attacked quickly , they wool ( I stand to defend them . His counsel was to go for them as quickly as possible , while the men were still in good spirits , and the enemy shaken by their last defeat . What did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack . Ochoa outlined this program : Lieutenant Vargas and Troop A would remain here . The rest would be divided into two divisions of seventy-five men each , one under himself , one under Captain Sanchez . They would not carry packs , and the women , of course , would be left behind . He described the marching order . They would enter the jungle at the first beginning of light , about a quarter of a mile apart , and proceed northeast . Whicheverdivision found the enemy would attack , the other would come up in support . It was eerie , standing in the darkness , looking up at the black arch of trees , and waiting . The texture of the sky began to change , a faint greyness showed the long , misty aisles , the command to march was whispered . Esteban , in Sanchez ' division , watched the day grow with relief . There were no trails , only a direction . The troops marched in parallel columns of single file , twisting in and out , all tensely alert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . They saw not a single enemy , heard nothing save the occasional call of a bird , the sudden , bright flash of a parrot against the green overhead . The brush became thicker , and the units instinctively drew together . It was a panicky sort of business . They heard firing on their right , sounding so distant that they knew the two divisions must have moved farther apart . They started towards the sound on the double , listening to the noise , first of volleys , then of individual shots . They crashed through bushes , stumbled over vines , were torn by thorns , at every step they pushed through some obstacle . The sound of fighting had ceased . Sanchez called on them to hurry . It was hot and close , the men were panting furiously . The advance halted abruptly , the others piled up behind them , to see a narrow , precipitous ravine right at their feet . For a moment they were huddled together , completely out of line ; at just this moment thep161forest began to spout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no volleys , no orders or formations , just confusion and shouts , and to every soldier a group of naked , long-haired , yelling savages . Some of the men ran , but there was nowhere to run to . Esteban , ducking under a spear thrust , fell backwardsover the edge of the ravine . He slithered down , bumping hard rock , until he landed , upside clown , against a small tree . It flashed through his mind at the moment that he was glad Favia had not seen him . A soldier landed on top of him , knocking out his breath , and he half fainted . Recovering , he saw that the man was dead . It took him some time to get free and right side up , and then he slid yet farther down . Collecting his sword and pistols , he climbed as quickly as possible to the top and , in a moment of caution , peered over before he showed himself . He ducked back immediately . There were only savages on their feet up there , moving about rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the ravine , crept cautiously along it , and began to run . He fell over a liana and lay with his burning face against the moist earth , exhausted , his heart and lungs making so much noise that he thought they must be audible for a league around . By and by he sat up , feelingbetter . He loaded his pistols carefully , though his hands still trembled so that this was difficult . He began to walk , guiding himself by stray gleams of sunlightagainst the upper parts of trees , which showed him where west was . The ravine beginning to turn north , he climbed out of it reluctantly , and continued along the level .   Now that he was over his first burst of panic , he moved slowly and softly , straining his ears . This forestwas a terrible place , it hemmed a man in and struck at him . The Tishaniles were only one manifestationof its powers . The jungle itself might attack , with a snake or scorpion or falling tree or pitfall , or with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . All he wanted in the world was to be out of here . He had to stop himself from running , and he prayed in his heart with considerable fervour . The tiny flecks of gold disappeared from among the trees , the contrast between lower and upper leaves ceased to show , dusk welled up between the big trunks and the tree-ferns . Sunset was a shock . He decided to climb a tree . It was almost dark before he found one that he could get up , and he climbed nervously , his knife between his teeth , watchful for snakes or jaguars . A triple fork made a fair nest , where he could sit down with feet dangling and a rest to his back . He thought he would give his soul to see sharp , mountain stars once more , to smell pines and feel cold . Here , one might as well be in a locked room , it was as dark and as shut in ; in a locked room full of enemies . And this was to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses in Tierra Fria . Fria , Fria , it was a strange thought that somewhere there existeda Tierra Fria . San Pedro Uyala and Cerromayor and his friends in Olintlan were real facts which ought to disprove his situation , but they did not , any more than did his rank in the regiment , if there was any regiment at all now . Promotion would be no good to ap163corpse . He had been one of four hundred fine warriors , and now he was just a man , afraid , in the darkness . A few rags , a sword , a pistol , and a few ideas in his head were the only difference between himself and the savageswho hunted him . Captain Esteban Perez y I3agil , dicho de Cerromayor , of the 17th Cavalry . A man , hiding . He wondered about Ochoa , if he were dead , after all his ups and downs . Muleteer , general on the wrong side , colonel of regulars , but always Ochoa . So was he always Esteban Perez , even in those ( lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosed him , and inside that was everything that mattered . What good was it to him that San Pedro and Alturas and Favia would continue , if he died and rotted in the jungle ? Vaquero or captain or general or fugitive , it was all in here , this was all he really had . That was part of what his mother had tried to tell him . She had seen him clinging more and more to Cerromayor , and had tried to make him understand . She was right . What good did all those great things do him now ? The Sublevados lost their capital and their altars , but they remained Tishaniles and went on fighting . They understood , and they were brave men . When he got back to Chuulob , he would burn a little incense to their gods . If there still were soldiers at Chuulob . Perhaps he was the only one alive between here and Tonala , no help at all . Well , then one dies . Poor Marta ! He did not meditate consecutively , his emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . He started at little noises . The innu- merable insects of the forest maintained a constant , low droning to which he had become accustomed , then they would all stop at once , and in the few seconds of utter silence , when the whole night seemed to be listening , he would hear his heart beat , his eardrums would seem about to break outwards , but nothing happened , and with the same suddenness the drone would start again . He grew cramped , and shifted his position carefullyfrom time to time , rubbing his legs to restore circulation . His heart leaped violently once , when his sword clanked . Now and again he heard the Tishanil drums , staccato and triumphant , and , faintly , the sound of chanting . The sense of his aloneness , of there being nothing real for him outside himself , grew upon him until it reached back to his earliest childhood , and forward as far as he could imagine , into the clearly visualized end and loneliness of death . The voices of the insects died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . In darkness still , he could see patterns above him , and the main branches of the great trees , joining into their long trunks that faded away into a blackness without bottom . Slowly the light increased , then suddenly the leaves were bright green above him , the ground was filled with colour and detail . His heart jumped up and he grew weak as he heard , ahead of him and not far , the clear , bright notes of a bugle playing reveille . He rose carefully to his feet , moved his stiff legs to get the blood going , and climbed down . Now that he knew there were soldiers still in order , near at hand , heP165was doubly afraid . He moved like a shadow , seeking cover , crawling , peering anxiously before each new step . He saw a brightness ahead , and caught a glimpse of blue sky through branches . On hands and knees he reached the edge of the jungle , to lie under a clump of ramon bushes , trembling from head to foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it still hung above the houses ; a group of soldiers marching in squad formation , little dark figures with flashes of light on their guns , seemed to him more beautiful than a man 's heart could stand . Rising to his feet , feeling giddy , he stepped forward . There was a shot , and a bullet whipped past him . I Ie began to run , crying Alturas ! Alturas ! ' Then he knew he was going to faint . A soldier came up to him , he could just see his sheepish face and hear him saying , Pardon , pardon , ' and fell , still trying to answer , It 's all right . '  |p166LEUTENANT  VARGAS sat opposite him , withanxious lines drawn in his broad , tough face . Esteban marvelled at himself for still being able to eat . They must be all dead , ' he repeated . ' All dead , ' Vargas nodded slowly . You are the only officer to return . ' ' How many men got back ? ' ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours brought in two squads in good order , a capable man . He was crazy , though , wanted to go back and look for you . ' Don Antonio , at the far end of the table , wiped his glasses . The little man tried to speak and could not , so he blew his long nose instead . Ochoa , Sanchez , Ferraz , Gordillo , ' Esteban began . ' Stop it ! ' said the secretary , and choked again . ' We have work to do . Holy Mother , pray for us . What is to be done next ? ' He and Vargas looked at Esteban . It came in upon him that he was in command , another weight settling on his shoulders . ' Parade and see what we 've got , and how many of those who came back have guns . ' ' We have forty-two guns belonging to those killed or wounded in taking this place , ' Don Antonio said precisely , ' twenty arrobas of powder , which is plenty , P167thirty-two sacks of ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . Call the bugler . ' They mustered eighty-three men able to fight , of whom sixty-eight were fit for heavy duty . Esteban divided them into two troops , one under Vargas , one under the secretary who , somewhat to his surprise , turned out to be a competent man , well versed in warfare , and actuated by a passionate devotion to Ochoa 's memory . The women were set to work on defences , food was rationed . Vargas wondered if they should not try to get back to Tonal. , but they agreed that it would be suicidal to attempt it . ' Help will come , ' Esteban said . ' And , by God , I would sooner be killed here than abandon what those men died for . ' Don Antonio patted his shoulder . ' I am with you . ' ' I , too , ' said Vargas . Dawn attacks , skirmishes , night alarms , short rations , monotony . Some of the wounded recovered enough to return to active service , more died . The horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now and again they held horse-races , and daily mounted drills helped pass the time . They lost track of dates , and used to argue about how long they had been there . They planned to plant cornfields when the rains began . A big cross was set up in the middle of the plaza . Esteban wondered if they would stay there forever in the jungle , becoming a new , strange tribe ; he saw himself commanding these men 's children in his old age . Somewhere in a world one had imagined were Favia and Uyala and the purposes of life . Personalities became important , each soldier stood out as an individual . Esteban felt that he knew them as though they had all grown up in the same village  --  it was all very much like that , a village of workmen and himself the chief foreman , with defence and attack for a task . The more he learned about them , the less differencehe could see between them and the Uyala peons . He wondered whether , given the same chance , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibility . It was impossible to go on thinking of these men , as the days went by , in broad terms of caste catch-phrases , they shared alike too much , and knew each other too well . Fortunately , he and Vargas and Don Antonio got on well together . Vargas was a big man , rough , with the speech and manners of a muleteer , very good-natured , and , having no imagination , optimistic . He was free of affectation and readily admitted when he was wrong . Don Antonio Rodas , a disbarred lawyer with a habit of framing his remarks oratorically , was of another type entirely . He held Esteban at arm 's length , as though he had some ultimate standard by which Estebanmust be measured before he could be admitted to intimacy . The whole garrison was regularly on duty for the dangerous hour before dawn . It was always a period of dull suspense that , curiously enough , seemed to incite to whispered garrulousness . One time when Esteban had completed his rounds , he walked back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beeswax candles still burned in front of the main altar , making vague-edged , soft lights and thick shadows on its steep steps . Don Antonio , pointing to them , said , Pathetic , is n't it ? ' It is natural to them , sifior . As our colonel said , what is there but a few ideas between them and the Tishaniles ? For that matter , if you strip us , or take me as I was in that tree , how much difference is there in us ? ' They sat on the edge of the low terrace . Esteban nodded towards the candles . Ochoa understood . ' You admired him ? ' Esteban was surprised . He was the finest man I ever knew . He showed me how to be a man . ' Forgive me , mi capitdn , if I speak of something that puzzles me . It is surprising to me that one of your household should have transferred front the Guardia to here . ' Esteban felt that they were getting to the heart of things . Did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that you were all right . ' I am no more Cerromayor than you are . My father died at Cerro Caido ; he was a sergeant in this regiment . My mother was a Cuistlac Indian . The 17th Regiment is my household . ' I see . ' After that the little man shed his formality , and slowly Esteban learned his story . Don Antonio was a burning Liberalista ; in the early thirties , when the Partida Liberal was powerful , he had gone about giv- ing readings from a North American writer called Jefferson , and expounding democratic doctrine . It was thus that Ochoa , the illiterate , careless rancher , had come to know him , and the two had formed an alliance , with increasing political activity . When the Liberalista Party was suppressed in ' 33 , they joined the rebellion that followed , and Ochoa rose to be general . They fought and were beaten , fled , hid , and fought again , became exiles and bandits and fugitives , until at last it seemed too hopeless , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . They determined to look out for themselves , and so , as Don Antonio legalistically put it , they sold their nuisance value to the government , becoming the nucleus of the present regiment . They had been so long on the move that it bothered them to spend two nights in the same place , and they nearly opened fire , or ran , when they saw each other in Federal uniforms . Esteban saw that Liberalism was far from dead . To Don Antonio it was a great , silent movement . It shocked Esteban no longer , it did not even shock him when the little man tried to convert him , but it bored him . He had learned his lesson up in the tree , he was his own party . He found it very difficult to visualize the little attorney in an outlaws ' camp . The days went on . Esteban made it his duty to visit the hospital regularly , applying what he could remember of Valera 's methods . As the men 's jungle technique developed , he was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible . From time to time the Tishanilesp171traded with the outposts , bringing salt and native tobaccofor brass buttons , the brighter coloured pieces of paper money , coins , and small trinkets . One bright soldier exchanged a rifle for a Tishanil girl . Esteban releasedthe girl and , reluctantly , had the man shot . His shoulder healed , and he stayed free of sickness . Sometimes , when he was discouraged , he had difficulty concealing his irritability . Vargas at moments was too much a clown , Don Antonio too serious and too political . One could not always take this fragmentary regimentas a religion . At evening when he had gone the rounds , at noon when the sun was a weight upon the land , he returned to his house and Marta there , quiet and untroubling and sure . She bathed his head and saw that he was comfortable , without fussing . He told her of his annoyances , and she listened . When he was at ease , she told him a little gossip , through the other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this group or that , she diverted him with petty domestic news that had no military character . She was one person whom he did not have to tell what to do . He was a man with a home , and peace around the hearth . He was getting to know everyone else too well , and the monotony was deadly , but here was a repetition to which , as it grew constantly more assured and more familiar , he looked forward with always greater pleasure . Then one day they heard shooting , to the southward . It was so faint , and so incredible , that they did not know if there were really such a noise , or only a murmur of leaves exaggerated by their eager listening.  |p172Esteban  sent out a squad under Chirom to scout . He returned after nightfall to report that they had gone about a league without seeing any Tishaniles , and returnedbecause it was growing dark . But , mi capitan , ' the sergeant ended , as we were starting back , we really heard a bugle . ' Chirom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his met , lit with a common burst of joy . There seemed to be no enemy in the forest the next morning . Esteban sent Chirom scouting again , with instructions not to show himself to the troops if he found them , but to report back immediately . The sergeant came out of the jungle about noon , walked up to Esteban , saluted , and said in the most casual possible manner , A big force , mi capitan , will arrive here in about an hour . Mostly infantry . ' He assembled the regiment immediately . It was a fearsome-looking crew . Por Dios , ' he said , we 'll be lucky if they do n't take us for Sublevados . ' No one had a complete uniform , most of the men were stripped to the waist . Hats had been discarded by the more Indian soldiers long ago . What few clothes they had were in rags. i Companeros ! ' he said , recnforcements are at hand . Make them welcome , be glad to see them , but do not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole strength of the Tishaniles in two pitched battles . Do not let them think we are beaten . Let us be proud , we have a right to be.  |p173By  the way , any of you men who have shirts , or coats , or whole trousers , put them on . ' First they heard a drum , then the sound of many marchers , the rattle of accoutrements , voices . Esteban , waiting at the edge of the clearing , braced himself . Hastily he removed a tick from Ek Ahau 's ear . Had the column been commanded by a stranger , he would have carried out his program perfectly , but at the sight of General Martinez from Sacabil , his voice failed him . He sat stiff in the saddle , holding a long salute while he got his lips under control . The general , returning the salute , stared at him curiously , but withoutrecognition . Colonel Ochoa ? ' Martinez asked . He is dead , sir . Captain Esteban de Cerromayor , commanding the Seventeenth Cavalry , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Esteban mio ! Amigo , is this you ? ' Yes , sir . ' Despite himself , Guzman 's words came to his tongue . You are very welcome , mi general . I think you will find everything in order . ' Martinez spurred his horse forward and embraced him . Esteban began to cry . Your pardon , sir . We are rather tired . ' He got himself in hand , and they turned and rodetogether to the town . Martinez spoke of Sacabiland Uyala , the news , how he had left things there . Oh , the familiar , Highland names , the resurrectionof those places , become real and possible again !   They entered the plaza . The garrison presented arms. i Santo Dios ! ' exclaimed the general , ' is that yourregiment ? How many have you altogether ? ' Eighty-five , plus nineteen sick or wounded . ' And officers ? ' ' We three . ' Martinez fell silent . There really was nothing one could say . That evening they dined with the general and his staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his command , a column of three hundredwas coming from Tonala . With it would be the two troops of the 17th that had been left behind , under Le6n and Gdlvez . We shall have men enough , I think , ' he said , ' withoutkeeping you who have suffered so much . When the two troops arrive , I shall send you all to Olintlan  --  under your command , friend , you have earned it . In virtue of my authority as commander of the Army of the Ticab , I appoint you to the rank of colonel . You , Senor Teniente , I promote to captain . Senor Rodas , do you wish a commission ? ' ' Thank you , mi general , but I am averse to actual conflict . It frightens me . I should like to continue as secretary to the new colonel . ' I hope you will be so good , ' said Esteban . Galvez and Leon , when they arrived two days later , were somewhat annoyed to find Esteban , the newcomer , in Ochoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envoys to sue for peace , feeling that there were altogether too many Christians in the Ticab , and Esteban took advantage of Martinez ' elation to secure major 's commissions for the two captains . That , and the fact that Don Antonio accepted him so completely , helped to reconcile them . Fighting men , yes , and fighting women , Esteban thought , he loved them all . There was nothing but his sword-belt to show he was an officer , even his shirt was torn . Marta had cut up his coat to mend his breeches. lie did n't care , nobody cared about anything . They were on their way out , eighty women and a hundred and forty men , all as hard and useful as knives , but much less good-looking . It was a curious feeling to be riding in peace through the jungle ; from habit their eyes peered into hiding-places , they were alert , they kept sentries and patrols at night , but no one opposed them . They sang and shouted jokes from one end of the line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the regiment , and a very long corrido ' On the Death of Colonel Ochoa and Many Other Famous Soldiers . ' After one night at Puerto Ancho , when they all but wrecked the town and nearly went into action against the garrison , Esteban managed to keep them reasonablysober , but it required watchfulness . They were supposed to put their sick and wounded in the convent at Petenango , but they refused to leave comrades in Tierra Caliente , and commandeered wagons for them . They collected good things to eat , chickens and turkeys and eggs and beef and pork and chile and onions , **27;825;TOOLONG SHE was sitting beside the spring , with the sleepingchild upon her knees , the woman discovered that she had forgot its bottle .

It was four miles from town , Jefferson . He and his sister were born in Jefferson , seven years apart , in a house which they still owned , though his sister had wanted to sell the house when Benbow married the divorced wife of a man named Mitchell and moved to Kinston . Benbow would not agree to sell , though he had built a new bungalow in Kinston on borrowed money upon which he was still paying interest . When he arrived , there was no one about . He entered the house and he was sitting in the dim parlor behind the closed blinds , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his arrival . He made no sound . She had almost crossed the parlor door and vanished when she paused and looked full at him , without outwardsurprise , with that serene and stupid impregnability of heroic statuary ; she was in white .

That you had left , and if you came here , to tell you that she had gone back home to Kentucky and had sent for Little Belle . " " Ah , damnation , " Benbow said . " Why ? " his sister said .

" Go back home , Horace , " she said . " Not to Kinston , " Benbow said . " I had n't intended to stay here , anyway . It was n't Narcissa I was running to .

He told again about the three of them , himself and Goodwin and Tommy sitting on the porch , drinking from the jug and talking , and Popeye lurking about the house , coming out from time to time to ask Tommy to light a lantern and go down to the barn with him and Tommy would n't do it and Popeye would curse him , and Tommy sitting on the floor , scouring his bare feet on the boards with a faint , hissing noise , chortling : " Ai nt he a sight , now ?

He might have killed someone , might have deserted . He was talking about Manila and Mexican girls , and that halfwit chortling and glugging at the jug and shoving it at me : Take some mo ' ; and then I knew that the woman was just behind the door , listening to us . They are not married . I know that just like I know that that little black man had that flat little pistol in his coat pocket . But she 's out there , doing a nigger 's work , that 's owned diamonds and automobiles too in her day , and bought them with a harder currency than cash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table , waiting for somebody to feed him , with that immobility of blind people , like it was the backs of their eyeballs you looked at while they were hearing music you could n't hear ; that Goodwinled out of the room and completely off the earth , as far as I know . I never saw him again . I never knew who he was , who he was kin to . Maybe not to anybody . Maybe that old Frenchman that built the house a hundredyears ago did n't want him either and just left him there when he died or moved away . "  |p106The  next morning Benbow got the key to the house from his sister , and went into town . The house was on a side street , unoccupied now for ten years . He opened the house , drawing the nails from the windows . The furniturehad not been moved . In a pair of new overalls , with mops and pails , he scoured the floors . At noon he went down town and bought bedding and some tinned food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister drove up in her car . " Come on home , Horace , " she said . " Do nt you see you cant do this ? " " I found that out right after I started , " Benbow said . " Until this morning I thought that anybody with one arm and a pail of water could wash a floor . " " Horace , " she said . " I 'm the older , remember , " he said . " I 'm going to stay here . I have some covers . " He went to the hotel for supper . When he returned , his sister 's car was again in the drive . The Negro driver had brought a bundle of bedclothing . " Miss Narcissa say for you to use them , " the Negro said . Benbow put the bundle into a closet and made a bed with the ones which he had bought . Next day at noon , eating his cold food at the kitchen table , he saw through the window a wagon stop in the street . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabashed toilets , smoothing skirts and stockings , brushing one another 's back , opening parcels and donning various finery . The wagon had gone on . Tlhev followed , on foot , and he remembered that it was Satiir/day . He removed the overalls and dressed and left the house . The street opened into a broader one . To the left it went on to the square , the opening between two buildingsblack with a slow , continuous throng , like two streams of ants , above which the cupola of the courthouserose from a clump of oaks and locusts covered with ragged snow . He went on toward the square . Empty wagons still passed him and he passed still more women on foot , black and white , unmistakable by the unease of their garments as well as by their method of walking , believing that town dwellers would take them for town dwellers too , not even fooling one another . The adjacent alleys were choked with tethered wagons , the teams reversed and nuzzling gnawed cornearsover the tail-boards . The square was lined two-deep with ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons thronged in slow overalls and khaki , in mailorderscarves and parasols , in and out of the stores , soilingthe pavement with fruit- and peanut-hulls . Slow as sheep they moved , tranquil , impassable , filling the passages , contemplating the fretful hurrying of those in urbanshirts and collars with the large , mild inscrutability of cattle or of gods , functioning outside of time , having left time lying upon the slow and imponderable land green with corn and cotton in the yellow afternoon . Horace moved among them , swept here and there by the deliberate current , without impatience . Some of them lie knew ; most of the merchants and professional men remembered him as a boy , a youth , a brother lawyer  --  P108beyond a foamy screen of locust branches he could see the dingy second-story windows where he and his father had practised , the glass still innocent of water and soap as then  --  and he stopped now and then and talked with them in unhurried backwaters . The sunny air was filled with competitive radios and phonographs in the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , listening . The pieces which moved them were ballads simple in melody and theme , of bereavement and retribution and repentancemetallically sung , blurred , emphasised by static or needle  --  disembodied voices blaring from imitation wood cabinets or pebble-grain horn-mouths above the rapt faces , the gnarled slow hands long shaped to the imperious earth , lugubrious , harsh , and sad . That was Saturday , in May : no time to leave the land . Yet on Monday they were back again , most of them , in clumps about the courthouse and the square , and tradinga little in the stores since they were here , in their khaki and overalls and collarless shirts . All day long a knot of them stood about the door to the undertaker 's parlor , and boys and youths with and without schoolbooksleaned with flattened noses against the glass , and the bolder ones and the younger men of the town entered in twos and threes to look at the man called Tommy . He lay on a wooden table , barefoot , in overalls , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and singed with powder , while the coroner sat over him , trying to ascertain his last name . But none knew it , not even those who had known him for fifteenP109Fars about the countryside , nor the merchants who on infrequent Saturdays had seen him in town , barefoot , hatless , with his rapt , empty gaze and his cheek bulged innocently by a peppermint jawbreaker . For all general knowledge , he had none . P110ON THE DAY when the sheriff brought Goodwin to town , there was a Negro murderer in the jail , who had killed his wife ; slashed her throat with a razor so that , her whole head tossing further and further backward from the bloody regurgitation of her bubbling throat , she ran out the cabin door and for six or seven steps up the quiet moonlit lane . He would lean in the window in the evening and sing . After supper a few Negroes gathered along the fence below  --  natty , shoddy suits and sweat-stained overalls shoulder to shoulder  --  and in chorus with the murderer , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafed darkness that was almost summer , to listen to those who were sure to die and him wlio was already dead singing about heaven and being tired ; or perhaps in the interval between songs a rich , sourcelessvoice coming out of the high darkness where the ragged shadow of the heaven-tree which snooded the street lamp at the corner fretted and mourned : " Fo daysP111.no ! Den dey ghy stroy de bes ba'ytone singer in nawth Mississippi ! " Sometimes during the day he would lean there , singing alone then , though after a while one or two ragamuffin boys or Negroes with delivery baskets like as not , would halt at the fence , and the white men sitting in tilted chairs along the oil-foul wall of the garage across the street would listen above their steady jaws . " One day mo ! Den Ise a gawn po sonnen bitch . Say , Ai nt no place fer you in heavum ! Say , Ai nt no place fer you in hell ! Say , Ai nt no place fer you in jail ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his black head , his gaunt , brown , faintly harried face . " I ai nt in any position to wish any man that sort of luck , but I ' l l be damned . . .. " He would n't talk . " I did n't do it . You know that , yourself . You know I would n't have . I ai nt going to say what I think . I did n't do it . They 've got to hang it on me first . Let them do that . I 'm clear . But if I talk , if I say what I think or believe , I wont be clear . " I Ic was sitting on the cot in his cell . He looked up at the windows : two orifices not much larger than sabre slashes . " Is he that good a shot ? " Benbow said . " To hit a man t 1 rough one of those windows ? " Goodwin looked at him . " Who ? " " Popeye , " Benbow said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he ? " Benbow said . " I 've told all I 'm going to tell . I do nt have to clear myself ; it 's up to them to hang it on me . " " ' Then what do you want with a lawyer ? " Benbow said . " What do you want me to do ? "   Goodwin was not looking at him . " If you 'll just promise to get the kid a good newspaper grift when he 's big enough to make change , " he said . " Ruby 'll be all right . Wont you , old gal ? " He put his hand on the woman 's head , scouring her hair with his hand . She sat on the cot beside him , holding the child on her lap . It lay in a sort of drugged immobility , like the children which beggars on Paris streets carry , its pinched face slick with faint moisture , its hair a damp whisper of shadow across its gaunt , veined skull , a thin crescent of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gray crepe , neatly brushed and skilfully darned by hand . Parallel with each seam was that faint , narrow , glazed imprint which another woman would recognise at a hundred yards with one glance . On the shoulder was a purple ornament of the sort that may be bought in ten cent stores or by nail order ; on the cot beside her lay a gray hat with a neatly darned veil ; looking at it , Benbow could not remember when he had seen one before , when women ceased to wear veils . He took the woman to his house . They walked , she carrying the child while Benbow carried a bottle of milk and a few groceries , food in tin cans . The child still slept . " Maybe you hold it too much , " he said . " Suppose we get a nurse for it . " He left her at the house and returned to town , to a telephone , and he telephoned out to his sister 's , for the car . The car came for him . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper table . " You 're just meddling ! " his sister said , her serene face ,  |p113her  voice , furious . " When you took another man 's wife and child away from him I thought it was dreadful , but I said At least he will not have the face to ever come back here again . And when you just walked out of the house like a nigger and left her I thought that was dreadful too , but I would not let myself believe you meant to leave her for good . And then when you insisted without any reasonat all on leaving here and opening the house , scrubbingit yourself and all the town looking on and living there like a tramp , refusing to stay here where everybody would expect you to stay and think it funny when you would n't ; and now to deliberately mix yourself up with a woman you said yourself was a street-walker , a murderer'swoman . " " I cant help it . She has nothing , no one . In a made-over dress all neatly about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been more than half alive , wrapped in a piece of blanket scrubbed almost cotton-white . Askingnothing of anyone except to be let alone , trying to snake something out of her life when all you sheltered chaste women  --  " " Do you mean to say a moonshiner has n't got the money to hire the best lawyer in the country ? " Miss Jenny said . " It 's not that , " Horace said . " I 'm sure he could get a better lawyer . It 's that  --  " " Horace , " his sister said . She had been watching him . " Where is that woman ? " Miss jenny was watching him too , sitting a little forward in the wheel chair . " Did youthat woman into my house ? " " It 's my house too , honey .

Supposeit were you and Bory , and your husband accused of a murder you knew he did n't  --  " " I do nt want to think about her . I wish I had never heard of the whole thing . To think that my brother  --  Do nt you see that you are always having to clean up after yourself ? It 's not that there 's a litter left ; it 's that you  --  that  --  But to bring a street-walker , a murderess , into the house where I was born . " " Fiddlesticks , " Miss Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the lawyers call collusion ? connivance ? " Horace looked at her . " It seems to me you 've already had a little more to do with these folks than the lawyer in the case should have . You were out there where it happened yourselfnot long ago . Folks might begin to think you know more than you 've told . " " That 's so , " Horace said , " Mrs Blackstone . And sometimes I have wondered why I have n't got rich at the law . Maybe I will , when I get old enough to attend the same law school you did . " " If I were you , " Miss Jenny said , " I 'd drive back toP115town now and take her to the hotel and get her settled . It 's not late . " " And go on back to Kinston until the whole thing is over , " Narcissa said . " These people are not your people . Why must you do such things ? " " I can not stand idly by and see injustice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace , " Miss Jenny said . " Well , that irony which lurks in events , then . " " Hmmph , " Miss Jenny said . " It must be because she is one woman you know that do nt know anything about that shrimp . " " Anyway , I 've talked too much , as usual , " Horace said . " So I 'll have to trust you all  --  " " Fiddlesticks , " Miss Jenny said . " Do you think Narcissa'dwant anybody to know that any of her folks could know people that would do anything as natural as make love or rob or steal ? " There was that quality about his sister . During all the four days between Kinston and Jeffersonhe had counted on that imperviousness . He had n't expected her  --  any woman  --  to bother very much over a man she had neither married nor borne when she had one she did bear to cherish and fret over . But he had expected that imperviousness , since she had had it thirtysixyears . When he reached the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered , crossing floors which he had scrubbed himself , revealing at the time no more skill with a mop than he had expected , than he had with the lost hammer with which he nailed the windows down and the shutters to ten years ago , who could not even learn to drive a motor car . But that was ten years ago , the hammer replaced by the new one with which he had drawn the clumsy nails , the windows open upon scrubbed floor spaces still as dead pools within the ghostly embrace of hooded furniture . The woman was still up , dressed save for the hat . It lay on the bed where the child slept . Lying together there , they lent to the room a quality of transience more unmistakable than the makeshift light , the smug paradoxof the made bed in a room otherwise redolent of long unoccupation . It was as though femininity were a currentrunning through a wire along which a certain numberof identical bulbs were hung . " I 've got some things in the kitchen , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The child lay on the bed , beneath the unshaded light , and he wondered why women , in quitting a house , will remove all the lamp shades even though they touch nothing else ; looking down at the child , at its bluish eyelidsshowing a faint crescent of bluish white against its lead-colored cheeks , the moist shadow of hair capping its skull , its hands uplifted , curl-palmed , sweating too , thinking Good God . Good God . He was thinking of the first time he had seen it , lying in a wooden box behind the stove in that ruined house twenty miles from town ; of Popeye 's black presence lyingupon the house like the shadow of something no larger than a match falling monstrous and portentous upon something else otherwise familiar and everyday and twenty times its size ; of the two of them  --  himselfP117and the woman  --  in the kitchen lighted by a cracked and smutty lamp on a table of clean , spartan dishes and Goodwin and Popeye somewhere in the outer darkness peaceful with insects and frogs yet filled too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the box out from behind the stove and stood above it , her hands still hidden in her shapeless garment . " I have to keep him in this so the rats cant get to him , " she said . " Oh , " Horace said , " you have a son . " Then she showed him her hands , flung them out in a gesture at once spontaneousand diffident and self-conscious and proud , and told him he might bring her an orange-stick . She returned , with something wrapped discreetly in a piece of newspaper . He knew that it was a diaper , freshly washed , even before she said : " I made a fire in the stove . I guess I overstepped . " " Of course not , " he said . " It 's merely a matter of legal precaution , you see , " he said . " Better to put everybody to a little temporary discomfort than to jeopardize our case . " She did not appear to be listening . She spread the blanket on the bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , " Horace said . " If the judge suspected that I knew more about it than the facts would warrant  --  I mean , we must try to give everybody the idea that holding Lee for that killing is just  --  " " Do you live in Jefferson ? " she said , wrapping the blanket about the child . " No . I live in Kinston . I used to  --  I have practised here , though . " " You have kinfolks here , though . Women . That used to live in this house . " She lifted the child , tucking the blanketabout it . Then she looked at him . " It 's all right . I know how it is . You 've been kind . " " Damn it , " he said , " do you think  --  Come on . Let 's go on to the hotel . You get a good night 's rest , and I 'll be in early in the morning . Let me take it . " " I 've got him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him quietly for a moment , but she went on . He turned out the light and followed and locked the door . She was already in the car . He got in . " Hotel , Isom , " he said . " I never did learn to drive one , " he said . " Sometimes , when I think of all the time l have spent not learning to do things . . . " The street was narrow , quiet . It was paved now , though he could remember when , after a rain , it had been a canal of blackish substance half earth , half water , with murmuring gutters in which he and Narcissa paddled and splashed with tucked-up garments and muddy bottoms , after the crudest of whittled boats , or made loblollies by treading and treading in one spot with the intense oblivion of alchemists . He could remember when , innocent of concrete , the street was bordered on either side by paths of red brick tediously and unevenly laid and worn in rich , random maroon mosaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at that moment , pressed into the concrete near the entrance of the drive , were the prints of his and his sister 's naked feet in the artificial stone . The infrequent lamps mounted to crescendo beneath the arcade of a filling-station at the corner . The woman leaned suddenly forward . " Stop here , please , boy , " sheP119said . Isom put on the brakes . " I 'll get out here and walk , " she said . " You 'll do nothing of the kind , " Horace said . " Go on , Isom . " " No ; wait , " the woman said . " We 'll be passing people that know you . And then the square . " " Nonsense , " Horace said . " Go on , Isom . " " You get out and wait , then , " she said . " He can come straight back . " " You 'll do no such thing , " Horace said . " By heaven , I  --  Drive on , Isom ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the seat . Then she leaned forward again . " Listen . You 've been kind . You mean all right , but  --  " " You do nt think I am lawyer enough , you mean ? " " I guess I 've got just what was coming to me . There 's no use fighting it . " " Certainly not , if you feel that way about it . But you do n't . Or you 'd have told Isom to drive you to the railroad station . Would n't you ? " She was looking down at the child , fretting the blanket about its face . " You get a good night 's rest and I 'll be in early tomorrow . " They passed the jail  --  a square building slashed harshly by pale slits of light . Only the central window was wide enough to be called a window , criss-crossed by slender bars . In it the Negro murderer leaned ; below along the fence a row of heads hatted and bare above work-thickened shoulders , and the blended voices swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing of heaven and being tired . " Do nt you worry at all now . Everybody knows Lee did n't do it . "   They drew up to the hotel , where the drummers sat in chairs along the curb , listening to the singing . " I must  --  " the woman said . Horace got down and held the door open . She did n't move . " Listen . I 've got to tell  --  " " Yes , " Horace said , extending his hand . " I know . I 'll be in early tomorrow . " He helped her down . They entered the hotel , the drummers turning to watch her legs , and went to the desk . The singing followed them , dimmed by the walls , the lights . The woman stood quietly nearby , holding the child , until Horace had done . " Listen , " she said . The porter went on with the key , toward the stairs . Horace touched her arm , turning her that way . " I 've got to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 'll be in early , " he said , guiding her toward the stairs . Still she hung back , looking at him ; then she freed her arm by turning to face hint . " All right , then , " she said . She said , in a low , level tone , her face bent a little toward the child : " We have n't got any money . I 'll tell you now . That last batch Popeye did n't  --  " " Yes , yes , " Horace said ; " first thing in the morning . I 'll be in by the time you finish breakfast . Good night . " Ile returned to the car , into the sound of the singing . " Home , Isom , " he said . They turned and passed the jail again and the leaning shape beyond the bars and the heads along the fence . Upon the barred and slitted wall the splotched shadow of the heaven-tree shuddered and pulsed monstrously in scarce any wind ; rich and sad , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andP121swift , passing the narrow street . " Here , " Horace said , " where are you  --  " Isom clapped on the brakes . " Miss Narcissa say to bring you back out home , " he said . " Oh , she did ? " Horace said . " That was kind of her . You can tell her I changed her mind . " Isom backed and turned into the narrow street and then into the cedar drive , the lights lifting and boring ahead into the unpruned tunnel as though into the most profound blackness of the sea , as though among straying rigid shapes to which not even light could give color . The car stopped at the door and Horace got out . " You might tell her it was not to her I ran , " he said . " Can you remember that ? " P122THE LAST trumpet-shaped bloom had fallen from the heaven-tree at the corner of the jail yard . They lay thick , viscid underfoot , sweet and oversweet in the nostrils with a sweetness surfeitive and moribund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsed upon the barred window in shabby rise and fall . The window was in the general room , the white-washed walls of which were stained with dirty hands , scribbled and scratched over with names and dates and blasphemous and obscenedoggerel in pencil or nail or knife-blade . Nightly the Negro murderer leaned there , his face checkered by the shadow of the grating in the restless interstices of leaves , singing in chorus with those along the fence below . Sometimes during the day he sang also , alone then save for the slowing passersby and ragamuffin boys and the garage men across the way . " One day mo ! Ai nt no place fer you in heavum ! Ai nt no place fer you in hell ! P123Aint no place fer you in whitefolks ' jail ! Nigger , whar you gwine to ? Whar you gwine to , nigger ? " Each morning Isom fetched in a bottle of milk , which I Iorace delivered to the woman at the hotel , for the child . On Sunday afternoon he went out to his sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwin 's cell , the child on her lap . Heretofore it had lain in that drugged apathy , its eyelids closed to thin crescents , but today it moved now and then in frail , galvanic jerks , whimpering . Horace went up to Miss jenny 's room . His sister had not appeared . " He wont talk , " Horace said . " He just says they will have to prove he did it . He said they had nothing on him , no more than on the child . He would n't even consider bond , if he could have got it . He says he is better off in the jail . And I suppose he is . His business out there is finished now , even if the sheriff had n't found his kettles and destroyed  --  " " Kettles ? " " His still . After he surrendered , they hunted around until they found the still . They knew what he was doing , but they waited until he was down . Then they all jumped on him . The good customers , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them free and maybe trying to make love to his wife behind his back . You should hear them down town . This morning the Baptist minister took him for a text . Not only as a murderer , but as an adulterer ; a polluter of the free Democratico-Protestant atmosphere of Yoknapatawpha county . I gathered that his idea was that Goodwin and the woman should both be burned as a sole example to that child ; the child to be reared and taught the English language for the sole end of being taught that it was begotin sin by two people who suffered by fire for having begot it . Good God , can a man , a civilised man , seriously . . . " " They 're just Baptists , " Miss Jenny said . " What about the money ? " " He had a little , almost a hundred and sixty dollars . It was buried in a can in the barn . They let him dig that up . That 'll keep her ' he says until it 's over . Then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good while . If I 'd listened to her , we 'd have been gone already . You 've been a good girl ' he says . She was sitting on the cot beside him , holding the baby , and he took her chin in his hand and shook her head a little . " " It 's a good thing Narcissa ai nt going to be on that jury , " Miss Jenny said . " Yes . But the fool wont even let me mention that that gorilla was ever on the place . He said They cant prove anything on me . I 've been in a jam before . Everybody that knows anything about me knows that I would n't hurt a feeb . ' But that was n't the reason he does n't want it told about that thug . And he knew I knew it was n't , because he kept on talking , sitting there in his overalls , rolling his cigarettes with the sack hanging in his teeth . ' I ' 11 just stay here until it blows over . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . And this will keep her , with maybe something for you until you 're betterpaid . ' " But I knew what he was thinking . I did n't know you were a coward ' I said .

Dammit , say what you want to , but there 's a corruption about even looking upon evil , even by accident ; you can not haggle , traffic , with putrefaction  --  You 've seen how Narcissa , just hearingabout it , how it 's made her restless and suspicious . I thought I had come back here of my own accord , but now I see that  --  Do you suppose she thought I was bringing that woman into the house at night , or something like that ?

" We were just talking about murder and crime , " Miss Jenny said . " I hope you 're through , then , " Narcissa said . She did not sit down . " Narcissa has her sorrows too , " Miss Jenny said . " Do nt you , Narcissa ? " " What now ? " Horace said . " She has n't caught Bory with alcohol on his breath , has she ? " " She 's been jilted . Her beau 's gone and left her .

" And now I flinch every time the doorbell rings , thinking that his mother  --  " " Miss Jenny , " Narcissa said , " you give me my letter . " " Wait , " Miss Jenny said , " here it is . Now , what do you think of that for a delicate operation on the human heart without anaesthetic ? I 'm beginning to believe all this I hear , about how young folks learn all the things in order to get married , that we had to get married in order to learn . " Horace took the single sheet . Narcissa my dearThis has no heading . I wish it could have no date . But if my heart were as blank as this page , this would not be necessary at all . I will not see you again . I cannotwrite it , for I have gone through with an experiencewhich I can not face .

I wish I had the right to say , if you learn of my folly think not the less of me . G.Horace read the note , the single sheet . He held it between his hands . He did not say anything for a while . " Good Lord , " Horace said . " Someone mistook him fura Mississippi man on the dance floor . " " I think , if I were you  --  " Narcissa said . After a moment she said : " How much longer is this going to last , Horace ? " " Not any longer than I can help . If you know of anyP127way in which I can get him out of that jail by tomorrow . . . " " There 's only one way , " she said . She looked at him a moment . Then she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dinner 'll be ready soon . " She went out . " And you know what that way is , " Miss Jenny said . " If you ai nt got any backbone . " " I 'll know whether or not I have any backbone when you tell me what the other way is . " " Go back to Belle , " Miss Jenny said . " Go back home . " The Negro murderer was to be hanged on a Saturday without pomp , buried without circumstance : one night he would be singing at the barred window and yelling down out of the soft myriad darkness of a May night ; the next night he would be gone , leaving the window for Goodwin . Goodwin had been bound over for the June term of court , without bail . But still he would not agree to let Horace divulge Popeye 's presence at the scene of the murder . " I tell you , they 've got nothing on me , " Goodwin said . " How do you know they have n't ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they have on me , I stand a chance in court . But just let it get to Memphis that I said he was anywhere around there , what chance do you think I 'd have to get back to this cell after I testified ? " " You 've got the law , justice , civilization . " " Sure , if I spend the rest of my life squatting in that corner yonder . Come here . " He led Horace to the window . " There are five windows in that hotel yonder that look into this one . And I 've seen him light matches with a pistol at twenty feet . Why , damn it all , I 'd never get back here from the courtroom the day I testified that . " " But there 's such a thing as obstruct  --  " " Obstructing damnation . Let them prove I did it . Tommy was found in the barn , shot from behind . Let them find the pistol . I was there , waiting . I did n't try to run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was me notified the sheriff . Of course my being there alone except for her and Pap looked bad . If it was a stall , do nt common sense tell you I 'd have invented a better one ? " " You 're not being tried by common sense , " Horace said . " You 're being tried by a jury . " " Then let them make the best of it . That 's all they 'll get . The dead man is in the barn , had n't been touched ; me and my wife and child and Pap in the house ; nothing in the house touched ; me the one that sent for the sheriff . No , no ; I know I run a chance this way , but let me just open my head about that fellow , and there 's no chance to it . I know what I 'll get . " " But you heard the shot , " Horace said . " You have alreadytold that . " " No , " he said , " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about it . . . . Do you mind waiting outsidea minute while I talk to Ruby ? " It was five minutes before she joined him . He said : " There 's something about this that I do nt know yet ; that you and Lee have n't told me . Something he just warned you not to tell me . Is n't there ? " She walked beside him , carrying the child . It was still whimpering now and then , tossing its thin body in sudden jerks . She triedp129to soothe it , crooning to it , rocking it in her arms . " Maybe you carry it too much , " Horace said ; " maybe if you could leave it at the hotel .. . " " I guess Lee knows what to do , " she said . " But the lawyer should know all the facts , everything . IIe is the one to decide what to tell and what not to tell . Else , why have one ? That 's like paying a dentist to fix your teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt you see ? You would n't treat a dentist or a doctor this way . " She said nothing , her head bent over the child . It wailed . " Hush , " she said , " hush , now . " " And worse than that , there 's such a thing called obstructingjustice . Suppose he swears there was nobody else there , suppose he is about to be cleared  --  which is not likely  --  and somebody turns up who saw Popeye about the place , or saw his car leaving . Then they 'll say , if Lee did n't tell the truth about an unimportant thing , why should we believe him when his neck 's in danger ? " They reached the hotel . He opened the door for her . She did not look at him . " I guess Lee knows best , " she said , going in . The child wailed , a thin , whimpering , distressfulcry . " Hush , " she said . " Shhhhhhhhhhhh . " Isom had been to fetch Narcissa from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner and picked him up . A few of the lights were beginning to come on , and men were already drifting back toward the square after supper , but it was still too early for the Negro murderer to begin to sing . " And he 'd better sing fast , too , " Horace said . " He 's only got two days more . " But he was not there vet . The jail faced west ; a last faint copper-colored light lay upon the dingy grating and upon the small , pale blob of a hand , and in scarce any wind a blue wisp of tobacco floated out and dissolved raggedly away . " If it was n't bad enough to have her husband there , without that poor brute counting his remaining breaths at the top of his voice .. .. " " Maybe they 'll wait and hang them both together , " Narcissa said . " They do that sometimes , do nt they ? " That night Horace built a small fire in the grate . It was not cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals at the hotel ; the rest of the house was locked again . He tried to read , then he gave up and undressed and went to bed , watching the fire die in the grate . He heard the town clock strike twelve . " When this is over , I think I 'll go to Europe , " he said . " I need a change . Either I , or Mississippi , one . " Maybe a few of them would still be gathered along the fence , since this would be his last night ; the thick , small-headed shape of him would be clinging to the bars , gorilla-like , singing , while upon his shadow , upon the checkered orifice of the window , the ragged grief of the heaven-tree would pulse and change , the last bloom fallen now in viscid smears upon the sidewalk . Horace turned again in the bed . " They ought to clean that damn mess off the sidewalk , " he said . " Damn . Damn . Damn . " He was sleeping late the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by someone knocking at the door . It was half-past six . He went to the door . ' I'Ihn Negro porter of the hotel stood there . " What ? " Horace said . " Is it Mrs Goodwin ? "   " She say for you to come when you up , " the Negro said . " Tell her I 'll be there in ten minutes . " As he entered the hotel he passed a young man with a small black bag , such as doctors carry . Horace went on up . The woman was standing in the half-open door , looking down the hall . " I finally got the doctor , " she said . " But I wanted anyway . . .. " The child lay on the bed , its eyes shut , flushed and sweating , its curled hands above its head in the attitudeof one crucified , breathing in short , whistling gasps . " He was sick all last night . I went and got some medicine and I tried to keep him quiet until daylight . At last I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking down at the child . " There was a woman there , " she said . " A young girl . " " A  --  " Horace said . " Oh , " he said . " Yes . You 'd better tell me about it . " P132POPEYE DROVE SWIFTLY but without any quality of hasteor of flight , down the clay road and into the sand . Temple was beside him . Her hat was jammed onto the back of her head , her hair escaping beneath the crumpled brine in matted clots . Her face looked like a sleepwalker 's as she swayed limply to the lurching of the car . She lurched against Popeye , lifting her hand in limp reflex . Without releasing the wheel he thrust her back with his elbow . " Brace yourself , " he said . " Come on , now . " Before they came to the tree they passed the woman . She stood beside the road , carrying the child , the hen m of her dress folded back over its face , and she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly in and out of Temple 's vision without any motion , any sign . When they reached the tree Popeye swung the car out of the road and drove it crashing into the undergrowth and through the prone tree-top and back into the roadP133again in a running popping of cane-stalks like musketry along a trench , without any diminution of speed . Beside the tree Gowan 's car lay on its side . Temple looked vaguely and stupidly at it as it too shot behind . Popeye swung back into the sandy ruts . Yet there was no flight in the action : he performed it with a certain viciouspetulance , that was all . It was a powerful car . Even in the sand it held forty miles an hour , and up the narrowgulch to the highroad , where he turned north . Sittingbeside him , braced against jolts that had already given way to a smooth increasing hiss of gravel , Temple gazed dully forward as the road she had traversed yesterdaybegan to flee backward under the wheels as onto a spool , feeling her blood seeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the seat , watching the steady backward rush of the land  --  pines in opening vistas splashed with fading dogwood ; sedge ; fields green with new cotton and empty of any movement , peaceful , as though Sunday were a quality of atmosphere , of light and shade  --  sitting with her legs close together , listening to the hot minute seeping of her blood , saying dully to herself , I 'm still bleeding . I 'm still bleeding . It was a bright , soft day , a wanton morning filled with that unbelievable soft radiance of May , rife with a promiseof noon and of heat , with high fat clouds like gobs of whipped cream floating lightly as reflections in a mirror , their shadows scudding sedately across the road . It had been a lavender spring . The fruit trees , the white ones , had been in small leaf when the blooms matured ; they had never attained that brilliant whiteness of last spring , and the dogwood had come into full bloom after the leaf also , in green retrograde before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shabby heaven-trees , had never been finer , fulgent , with a burning scent blowing for a hundred yards along the vagrant air of April and May . The bougainvillaea against the veranda would be large as basketballs and lightly poised as balloons , and looking vacantly and stupidly at the rushing roadside Temple began to scream . It started as a wail , raising , cut suddenly off by Popeye'shand . With her hands lying on her lap , sitting erect , she screamed , tasting the gritty acridity of his fingers while the car slewed squealing in the gravel , feeling her secret blood . Then he gripped her by the back of the neck and she sat motionless , her mouth round and open like a small empty cave . He shook her head . " Shut it , " he said , " shut it " ; gripping her silent . " Look at yourself . Here . " With the other hand he swung the mirror on the windshield around and she looked at her image , at the uptilted hat and her matted hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat pockets , looking at her reflection . He released her and she producedthe compact and opened it and peered into the mirror , whimpering a little . She powdered her face and rouged her mouth and straightened her hat , whimpering into the tiny mirror on her lap while Popeye watched her . He lit a cigarette . " Ai nt you ashamed of yourself ? " he said . " It 's still running , " she whimpered . " I can feel it . " With the lipstick poised she looked at him and opened her mouth again . He gripped her by the back of the neck . " Stop it , now . You going to shut it ? "   " Yes , " she whimpered . " See you do , then . Come on . Get yourself fixed . " She put the compact away . He started the car again . The road began to thicken with pleasure cars Sunday-bent  --  small , clay-crusted Fords and Chevrolets ; an occasional larger car moving swiftly , with swathed women , and dust-covered hampers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colored wood meticulously carved ; now and then a wagon or a buggy . Before a weathered frame church on a hill the grove was full of tethered teams and battered cars and trucks . The woods gave away to fields ; houses became more frequent . Low above the skyline , above roofs and a spire or two , smoke hung . The gravel became asphalt and they entered Dumfries . Temple began to look about , like one waking from sleep . " Not here ! " she said . " I cant  --  " " Hush it , now , " Popeye said . " I cant  --  I might  --  " she whimpered . " I 'm hungry , " she said . " I have n't eaten since . . . " " Ala , you ai nt hungry . Wait till we get to town . " She looked about with dazed , glassy eyes . " There might be people here . . . " He swung in toward a filling station . " I cant get out , " she whimpered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who told you to get out ? " He descended and looked at her across the wheel . " Do nt you move . " She watched him go up the street and enter a door . It was a dingy confectionery . He bought a pack of cigarettes and put one in his mouth . " Gim me a couple of bars of candy , " he said . " What kind ? "  | " Candy , " he said . Under a glass bell on the counter a plate of sandwiches sat . He took one and flipped a dollaron the counter and turned toward the door . " Here 's your change , " the clerk said . " Keep it , " he said . " You 'll get rich faster . " When he saw the car it was empty . He stopped ten feet away and changed the sandwich to his left hand , the unlighted cigarette slanted beneath his chin . The mechanic , hanging the hose up , saw him and jerked his thumb toward the corner of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the niche was a greasy barrel half full of scraps of metal and rubber . Between the barrel and the wall Temple crouched . " He nearly saw me ! " she whispered . " He was almost looking right at me ! " " Who ? " Popeye said . He looked back up the street . " Who saw you ? " " He was coming right toward me ! A boy . At school . He was looking right toward  --  " " Come on . Come out of it . " " He was look  --  " Popeye took her by the arm . She crouched in the corner , jerking at the arm he held , her wan face craned around the corner . " Come on , now . " Then his hand was at the back of her neck , gripping it . " Oh , " she wailed in a choked voice . It was as though be were lifting her slowly erect by that one band . Exceptingthat , there was no movement between them . Side by side , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintances stopped to pass the time of day before enteringchurch .   " Are you coming ? " he said . " Are you ? " " I cant . It 's down to my stocking now . Look . " She lifted her skirt away in a shrinking gesture , then she dropped the skirt and rose again , her torso arching backward , her soundless mouth open as he gripped her . He released her . " Will you come now ? " She came out from behind the barrel . He took her arm . " It 's all over the back of my coat , " she whimpered . " Look and see . " " You 're all right . I 'll get you another coat tomorrow . Come on . " They returned to the car . At the corner she hung back again . " You want some more of it , do you ? " he whispered , not touching her . " Do you ? " She went on and got in the car quietly . He took the wheel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it from his pocket and put it in her hand . " Come on , now . Eat it . " She took a bite obediently . He started the car and took the Memphis road . Again , the bitten sandwich in her hand , she ceased chewing and opened her mouth in that round , hopeless expression of a child ; again his hand left the wheel and gripped the back of her neck and she sat motionless , gazing straight at him , her mouth open and the half chewed mass of bread and meat lying upon her tongue . They reached Memphis in midafternoon . At the foot of the bluff below Main Street Popeye turned into a narrowstreet of smoke-grimed frame houses with tiers of wooden galleries , set a little back in grassless plots , with now and then a forlorn and hardy tree of some shabby species  --  gaunt , lopbranched magnolias , a stunted elm or a locust in grayish , cadaverous bloom  --  interspersedP138by rear ends of garages ; a scrap-heap in a vacant lot ; a low doored cavern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backless stools , a metal coffee-urn and a fat man in a dirty apron with a toothpick in his mouth , stood for an instant out of the gloom with an effect as of a sinister and meaningless photograph poorly made . From the bluff , beyond a line of office buildings terraced sharply against the sunfilled sky , came a sound of traffic  --  motor horns , trolleys  --  passinghigh overhead on the river breeze ; at the end of the street a trolley materialised in the narrow gap with an effect as of magic and vanished with a stupendous clatter . On a second storey gallery a young Negro woman in her underclothes smoked a cigarette sullenly , her arms on the balustrade . Popeye drew up before one of the dingy three-storey houses , the entrance of which was hidden by a dingy latticecubicle leaning a little awry . In the grimy grassplot before it two of those small , woolly , white , worm-like dogs , one with a pink , the other a blue , ribbon about its neck , moved about with an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats looked as though they had been cleaned with gasoline . Later Temple could hear them outside her door , whimperingand scuffing , or , rushing thickly in when the Negro maid opened the door , climbing and sprawling onto the bed and into Miss Reba 's lap with wheezy , flatulent sounds , billowing into the rich pneumasis of her breast and tonguing along the metal tankard which she waved in one ringed hand as she talked . " Anybody in Memphis can tell you who Reba RiversP139is . Ask any man on the street , cop or not . I 've had some of the biggest men in Memphis right here in this house , bankers , lawyers , doctors  --  all of them . I 've had two policecaptains drinking beer in my dining-room and the commissioner himself upstairs with one of my girls . They got drunk and crashed the door in on him and found him buck-nekkid , dancing the highland fling . A man fifty years old , seven foot tall , with a head like a peanut . He was a fine fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spent their money here like water , they have . They know me . I ai nt never double-crossed nobody , honey . " She drank beer , breathing thickly into the tankard , the other hand , ringed with yellow diamonds as large as gravel , lost among the lush billows of her breast . Her slightest movement appeared to be accomplished by an expenditure of breath out of all proportion to any pleasure the movement could afford her . Almost as soon as they entered the house she began to tell Temple about her asthma , toiling up the stairs in front of them , plantingher feet heavily in worsted bedroom slippers , a wooden rosary in one hand and the tankard in the other . She had just returned from church , in a black silk gown and a hat savagely flowered ; the lower half of the tankardwas still frosted with inner chill . She moved heavily from big thigh to thigh , the two dogs moiling underfoot , talking steadily back across her shoulder in a harsh , expiring , maternal voice . " Popeye knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . I been after him for , how many years I been after you to get you a girl , honey ? What I say , a young fellow cant no more live without a girl than . . . "  | Panting , she fell to cursing the dogs under her feet , stopping to shove them aside . " Get back down there , " she said , shaking the rosary at them . They snarled at her in vicious falsetto , baring their teeth , and she leaned against the wall in a thin aroma of beer , her hand to her breast , her mouth open , her eyes fixed in a glare of sad terror of all breathing as she sought breath , the tankard a squat soft gleam like dull silver lifted in the gloom . The narrow stairwell turned back upon itself in a succession of niggard reaches . The light , falling through a thickly-curtained door at the front and through a shutteredwindow at the rear of each stage , had a weary quality . A spent quality ; defunctive , exhausted  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid noises of sunlight and day . There was a defunctiveodor of irregular food , vaguely alcoholic , and Temple even in her ignorance seemed to be surrounded by a ghostly promiscuity of intimate garments , of discreet whispers of flesh stale and oft-assailed and impregnable beyond each silent door which they passed . Behind her , about hers and Miss Reba 's feet the two dogs scrabbled in nappy gleams , their claws clicking on the metal strips which bound the carpet to the stairs . Later , lying in bed , a towel wrapped about her naked loins , she could hear them sniffing and whining outside the door . Her coat and hat hung on nails on the door , her dress and stockings lay upon a chair , and it seemed to her that she could hear the rhythmic splush-splush of the washing-board somewhere and she flung herself again in an agony for concealment as she had when they took her knickers off .   " Now , now , " Miss Reba said . " I bled for four days , myself . It ai nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Minnie 'll have them all washed and pressed and you wont never know it . That blood 'll be worth a thousand dollars to you , honey . " She lifted the tankard , the flowers on her hat rigidly moribund , nodding in macabre waes hail . " Us poor girls , " she said . The drawn shades , cracked into a myriad pattern like old skin , blew faintly on the bright air , breathing into the room on waning surges the sound of Sabbath traffic , festive , steady , evanescent . Temple lay motionless in the bed , her legs straight and close , in covers to her chin and her face small and wan , framed in the rich sprawl of her hair . Miss Reba lowered the tankard , gasping for breath . In her hoarse , fainting voice she began to tell Temple how lucky she was . " Every girl in the district has been trying to get him , honey . There 's one , a little married woman slips down here sometimes , she offered Minnie twenty-five dollars just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do you think he 'd so much as look at one of them ? Girls that have took in a hundred dollars a night . No , sir . Spend his money like water , but do you think he 'd look at one of them except to dance with her ? I always knowed it was n't going to be none of these here common whores he 'd take . I 'd tell them , I 'd say , the one of yez that gets him 'll wear diamonds , I says , but it ai nt going to be none of you commonwhores , and now Minnie 'll have them washed and pressed until you wont know it . " " I cant wear it again , " Temple whispered . " I cant . " " No more you 'll have to , if you do nt want . You canP.142 give them to Minnie , though I do nt know what she 'll do with them except maybe  --  " At the door the dogs began to whimper louder . Feet approached . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing a quart bottle of beer and a glass of gin , the dogs surging in around her feet . " And tomorrow the stores 'll be open and me and you 'll go shopping , like he said for us to . Like I said , the girl that gets him 'll wear diamonds : you just see if I was n't  --  " she turned , mountainous , the tankard lifted , as the two dogs scrambled onto the bed and then onto her lap , snapping viciously at one another . From their curled shapeless faces bead-like eyes glared with choleric ferocity , their mouths gaped pinkly upon needle-like teeth . " Reba ! " Miss Reba said , " get down ! You , Mr Binford ! " flinging them down , their teeth clicking about her hands . " You just bite me , you  --  Did you get Miss  --  What 's your name , honey ? I did n't quite catch it . " " Temple , " Temple whispered . " I mean , your first name , honey . We do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Temple . Temple Drake . " " You got a boy 's name , ai nt you ?  --  Miss Temple 's things washed , Minnie ? " " Yessum , " the maid said . " Hit 's dryin now hind the stove . " " She came with the tray , shoving the dogs gingerly aside while they clicked their teeth at her ankles . " You wash it out good ? " " I had a time with it , " Minnie said . " Seem like that the most hardest blood of all to get  --  " With a convulsive movement Temple flopped over , ducking her head beneath the covers . She felt Miss Reba 's hand.  | " Now , now . Now , now . Here , take your drink . This one 's on me . I ai nt going to let no girl of Popeye 's  --  " " I do nt want any more , " Temple said . " Now , now , " Miss Reba said . " Drink it and you 'll feel better . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat . Miss Reba held the glass to her lips . She gulped it , writhed down again , clutching the covers about her , her eyes wide and black above the covers . " I bet you got that towel disarranged , " Miss Reba said , puttingher hand on the covers . " No , " Temple whispered . " It 's all right . It 's still there . " She shrank , cringing ; they could see the cringing of her legs beneath the covers . " Did you get Dr Quinn , Minnie ? " Miss Reba said . " Yessum . " Minnie was filling the tankard from the bottle , a dull frosting pacing the rise of liquor within the metal . " He say he do nt make no Sunday afternoon calls . " " Did you tell him who wanted him ? Did you tell him Miss Reba wanted him ? " " Yessum . He say he do nt  --  " " You go back and tell that suh  --  You tell him I 'll  --  No ; wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back to me , that can put him in jail three times over . " She waddledtoward the door , the dogs crowding about the felt slippers . The maid followed and closed the door . Temple could hear Miss Reba cursing the dogs as she descended the stairs with terrific slowness . The sounds died away . The shades blew steadily in the windows with faint rasping sounds . Temple began to hear a clock . It sat on the mantel above a grate filled with fluted green paper.  |p144The  clock was of flowered china , supported by four china nymphs . It had only one hand , scrolled and gilded , halfway between ten and eleven , lending to the otherwiseblank face a quality of unequivocal assertion , as though it had nothing whatever to do with time . Temple rose from the bed . Holding the towel about her she stole toward the door , her ears acute , her eyes a little blind with the strain of listening . It was twilight ; in a dim mirror , a pellucid oblong of dusk set on end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost , a pale shadow moving in the uttermost profundity of shadow . She reached the door . At once she began to hear a hundred conflicting sounds in a single converging threat and she clawed furiously at the door until she found the bolt , dropping the towel to drive it home . Then she caught up the towel , her face averted , and ran back and sprang into the bed and clawed the covers to her chin and lay there , listening to the secret whisper of her blood . They knocked at the door for some time before she made any sound . " It 's the doctor , honey , " Miss Reba panted harshly . " Come on , now . Be a good girl . " " I cant , " Temple said , her voice faint and small . " I 'm in bed . " " Come on , now . He wants to fix you up . " She panted harshly . " My God , if I could just get one full breath again . I ai nt had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door Temple could hear the dogs . " Honey . " She rose from the bed , holding the towel about her . She went to the door , silently . " Honey , " Miss Reba said .   " Wait , " Temple said . " Let me get back to the bed beforeLet me get . " " There 's a good girl , " Miss Reba said . " I knowed she was going to be good . " " Count ten , now , " Temple said . " Will you count ten , now ? " she said against the wood . She slipped the bolt soundlessly , then she turned and sped back to the bed , her naked feet in pattering diminuendo . The doctor was a fattish man with thin , curly hair . He wore horn-rimmed glasses which lent to his eyes no distortionat all , as though they were of clear glass and worn for decorum 's sake . Temple watched him across the covers , holding them to her throat . " Make them go out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now , now , " Miss Reba said , " he 's going to fix you up . " Temple clung to the covers . " If the little lady will just let . . . " the doctor said . His hair evaporated finely from his brow . His mouth nipped in at the corners , his lips full and wet and red . Behindthe glasses his eyes looked like little bicycle wheels at dizzy speed ; a metallic hazel . He put out a thick , white hand bearing a masonic ring , haired over with fine reddishfuzz to the second knuckle-joints . Cold air slipped down her body , below her thighs ; her eyes were closed . Lying on her back , her legs close together , she began to cry , hopelessly and passively , like a child in a dentist 's waiting-room . " Now , now , " Miss Reba said , " take another sup of gin , honey . It 'll make you feel better . "   In the window the cracked shade , yawning now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room in fainting surges . From beneath the shade the smoke-colored twilight emerged in slow puffs like signal smoke from a blanket , thickening in the room . The china figures which supported the clock gleamed in hushed smooth flexions : knee , elbow , flank , arm and breast in attitudes of voluptuous lassitude . The glass face , become mirror-like , appeared to hold all reluctant light , holding in its tranquil depths a quiet gesture of moribund time , one-armed like a veteran from the wars . Half-past-ten oclock . Temple lay in the bed , looking at the clock , thinkingabout half-past-ten-oclock . She wore a too-large gown of cerise crepe , black against the linen . Her hair was a black sprawl , combed out now ; her face , throat and arms outside the covers were gray . After the others left the room she lay for a time , head and all beneath the covers . She lay so until she heard the door shut and the descending feet , the doctor 's light , unceasingvoice and Miss Reba 's labored breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sprang from the bed and ran to the door and shot the bolt and ran back and hurled the covers over her head again , lying in a tight knot until the air was exhausted . A final saffron-colored light lay upon the ceiling and the upper walls , tinged already with purple by the serrated palisade of Main Street high against the western sky . She watched it fade as the successive yawns of the shade consumed it . She watched the final light condense into the clock face , and the dial change from a round orifice in the darkness to a disc suspended in nothingness ,  |p147the  original chaos , and change in turn to a crystal ball holding in its still and cryptic depths the ordered chaos of the intricate and shadowy world upon whose scarred flanks the old wounds whirl onward at dizzy speed into darkness lurking with new disasters . She was thinking about half-past-ten-oclock . The hour for dressing for a dance , if you were popular enough not to have to be on time . The air would be steamy with recentbaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn-lofts , and they looking at one another , comparing , talking whether you could do more damage if you could just walk out on the floor like you were now . Some would n't , mostly ones with short legs . Some . of them were all right , but they just would n't . They would n't say why . The worst one of all said boys thought all girls were ugly except when they were dressed . She said the Snake had been seeing Eve for several days and never noticed her until Adam made her put on a fig leaf . How do you know ? they said , and she said because the Snake was there before Adam , because he was the first one thrown out of heaven ; he was there all the time . But that was n't what they meant and they said , How do you know ? and Temple thought of her kind of backed up against the dressing table and the rest of them in a circle around her with their combed hair and their shoulders smelling of scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes like knives until you could almost watch her flesh where the eyes were touching it , and her eyes in her ugly face courageous and frightened and daring , and they all saying , How do you know ? until she told them and held up her hand and swore she had . That was when theP148youngest one turned and ran out of the room . She locked herself in the bath and they could hear her being sick . She thought about half-past-ten-oclock in the morning . Sunday morning , and the couples strolling toward church . She remembered it was still Sunday , the same Sunday , looking at the fading peaceful gesture of the clock . Maybe it was half-past-ten this morning , that halfpast-ten-oclock . Then I 'm not here , she thought . This is not me Then I 'm at school . I have a date tonight with . . . thinking of the student with whom she had the date . But she could n't remember who it would be . She kept the dates written down in her Latin " pony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . She 'd just dress , and after a while somebody would call for her . So I betterget up and dress , she said , looking at the clock . She rose and crossed the room quietly . She watched the clock face , but although she could see a warped turmoilof faint light and shadow in geometric miniature swinging across it , she could not see herself . It 's this nightie , she thought , looking at her arms , her breast risingout of a dissolving pall beneath which her toes peeped in pale , fleet intervals as she walked . She drew the bolt quietly and returned to the bed and lay with her head cradled in her arms . There was still a little light in the room . She found that she was hearing her watch ; had been hearing it for some time . She discovered that the house was full of noises , seeping into the room muffled and indistinguishable , as though from a distance . A bell rang faintly and shrilly somewhere ; someone mounted the stairs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mounted an/other stair and ceased . She listened to the watch . A car started beneath the window with a grind of gears ; again the faint bell rang , shrill and prolonged . She found that the faint light yet in the room was from a street lamp . Then she realised that it was night and that the darkness beyond was full of the sound of the city . She heard the two dogs come up the stairs in a furious scrabble . The noise passed the door and stopped , becameutterly still ; so still that she could almost see them crouching there in the dark against the wall , watching the stairs . One of them was named Mister something , Temple thought , waiting to hear Miss Reba 's feet on the stairs . But it was not Miss Reba ; they came too steadily and too lightly . The door opened ; the dogs surged in in two shapeless blurs and scuttled under the bed and crouched , whimpering . " You , dawgs ! " Minnie 's voice said . " You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie carried a tray . " I got you some supper , " she said . " Where them dawgs gone to ? " " Under the bed , " Temple said . " I do nt want any . " Minnie came and set the tray on the bed and looked down at Temple , her pleasant face knowing and placid . " You want me to  --  " she said , extending her hand . Templeturned her face quickly away . She heard Minnie kneel , cajoling the dogs , the dogs snarling back at her with whimpering , asthmatic snarls and clicking teeth . " Come outen there , now , " Minnie said . " They know fo Miss Reba do when she fixing to get drunk . You , Mr. Bin-ford ! " Temple raised her head . " Mr Binford ? " " He the one with the blue ribbon , " Minnie said . Stoop- ing , she flapped her arm at the dogs . They were backed against the wall at the head of the bed , snapping and snarling at her in mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was landlord here twenty-five years until he die bout five years ago . Next day Miss Reba get these dawgs , name one Mr Binford and other Miss Reba . Whenever she go to the cemetery she start drinking like this evening , then they both got to run . But Mr Binford ketch it sho nough . Last time she throw him outen upstairwindow and go down and empty Mr Binford 's clothes closet and throw everything out in the street exceptwhat he buried in . " " Oh , " Temple said . " No wonder they 're scared . Let them stay under there . They wont bother me . " " Reckon I have to . Mr Binford ai nt going to leave thisx room , not if he know it . " She stood again , looking at Tern- pie . " Eat that supper , " she said . " You feel better . I done slip you a drink of gin , too . " " I do nt want any , " Temple said , turning her face away . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed the dogs crouched against the wall in that rigid and furious terror . The light hung from the center of the ceiling , beneath a fluted shade of rose-colored paper browned where the bulb bulged it . The floor was covered by a figured maroon-tintedcarpet tacked down in strips ; the olive- , tinted walls bore two framed lithographs . From the two windows curtains of machine lace hung , dust-colored , like strips of lightly congealed dust set on end . The whole room had an air of musty stodginess , decorum ; in the wavy mirror of a cheap varnished dresser , as in a stag-P151Want pool , there seemed to linger spent ghosts of voluptuousgestures and dead lusts . In the corner , upon a faded scarred strip of oilcloth tacked over the carpet , sat a washstand bearing a flowered bowl and pitcher and a row of towels ; in the corner behind it sat a slop jar dressed also in fluted rose-colored paper . Beneath the bed the dogs made no sound . Temple moved slightly ; the dry complaint of mattress and springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought of them , woolly , shapeless ; savage , petulant , spoiled , the flatulent monotony of their sheltered lives snatched up without warning by an incomprehensible moment of terror and fear of bodily annihilation at the very hands which symbolised by ordinary the licensed tranquillity of their lives . The house was full of sounds . Indistinguishable , remote , they came in to her with a quality of awakening , resurgence , as though the house itself had been asleep , rousing itself with dark ; she heard something which might have been a burst of laughter in a shrill woman voice . Steamy odors from the tray drifted across her face . She turned her head and looked at it , at the covered and uncovered dishes of thick china . In the midst of them sat the glass of pale gin , a pack of cigarettes and a box of matches . She rose on her elbow , catching up the slipping gown . She lifted the covers upon a thick steak , potatoes , green peas ; rolls ; an anonymous pinkish mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweet . She drew the slipping gown up again , thinking about them eating down at school in a bright uproar of voices and clattering forks ; of her father and brothers at the sup- per table at home ; thinking about the borrowed gown and Miss Reba saying that they would go shopping tomorrow . And I 've just got two dollars , she thought . When she looked at the food she found that she was not hungry at all , did n't even want to look at it . She lifted the glass and gulped it empty , her face wry , and set it down and turned her face hurriedly from the tray , fumblingfor the cigarettes . When she went to strike the match she looked at the tray again and took up a strip of potato gingerly in her fingers and ate it . She ate another , the unlighted cigarette in her other hand . Then she put the cigarette down and took up the knife and fork and began to eat , pausing from time to time to draw the gown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette . She heard the bell again , then another in a slightly different key . Across a shrill rush of a woman 's voice a door banged . Two people mounted the stairs and passed the door ; she heard Miss Reba 's voice booming from somewhere and listened to her toiling slowly up the stairs . Temple watched the door until it opened and Miss Reba stood in it , the tankard in her hand . She now wore a bldg  --  ing house dress and a widow 's bonnet with a veil . She enteredon the flowered felt slippers . Beneath the bed tit two dogs made a stifled concerted sound of utter despairThe dress , unfastened in the back , hung lumpily about Miss Reba 's shoulders . One ringed hand lay on her breast , the other held the tankard high . Her open mouth , studded with gold-fillings gaped upon the harsh labor of her breathing . " Oh God oh God , " she said . The dogs surged out fromP153beneath the bed and hurled themselves toward the door in a mad scrabble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tankard at them . It struck the door jamb , splashing up the wall , and rebounded with a forlorn clatter . She drew her breath whistling , clutching her breast . She came to the bed and looked down at Temple through the veil . " We was happy as two doves , " she wailed , choking , her rings smoldering in hot glints within her billowingbreast . " Then he had to go and die on me . " She drew her breath whistling , her mouth gaped , shaping the hiddenagony of her thwarted lungs , her eyes pale and round with stricken bafflement , protuberant . " As two doves , " she roared in a harsh , choking voice . Again time had overtaken the dead gesture behind the clock crystal : Temple 's watch on the table beside the bed said half-past-ten . For two hours she had lain undisturbed , listening . She could distinguish voices now from below stairs . She had been hearing them for some time , lying in the room 's musty isolation . Later a mechanical piano began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rakes in the street beneath the window ; once two voices quarreling bitterly came up and beneath the shade . She heard two people  --  a man and a woman  --  mount the stairs and enter the room next hers . Then she heard Miss Reba toil up the stairs and pass her door , and lying in the bed , her eyes wide and still , she heard Miss Reba hammering at the next door with the metal tankard and shouting into the wood . Beyond the door the man and woman were utterly quiet , so quiet that Temple thought of the dogs again , thought of them crouching against the wall under the bed in that rigid fury of terror and despair . She listened to Miss Reba 's voice shouting hoarsely into the blank wood . It died away into terrific gasping , then it rose again in the gross and virile cursing of a man . Beyond the wall the man and woman made no sound . Temple lay staring at the wall beyond which Miss Reba 's voice rose again as she hammered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her door when it opened . She just happened to look toward it after how long she did not know , and saw Popeye standing there , his hat slanted across his face . Still without making any sound he entered and shut the door and shot the bolt and came toward the bed . As slowly she began to shrink into the bed , drawing the covers up to her chin , watching him across the covers . He came and looked down at her . She writhed slowly in a cringing movement , cringing upon herself in as complete an isolation as though she were bound to a church steeple . She grinned at him , her mouth warped over the rigid , placative porcelain of her grimace . When he put his hand on her she began to whimper . " No , no , " she whispered , " he said I cant now ho said . . . " He jerked the covers back and flung them aside . She lay motionless , her palms lifted , her flesh be  --  neath the envelope of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in a crowd . When he advanced his hand again she thought he was go  --  ing to strike her . Watching his face , she saw it beginning to twitch and jerk like that of a child about to cry , and she heard him begin to make a whimpering sound . I In gripped the top of the gown . She caught his wrists andP155began to toss from side to side , opening her mouth to scream . His hand clapped over her mouth , and gripping his wrist , the saliva drooling between his fingers , her body thrashing furiously from thigh to thigh , she saw him crouching beside the bed , his face wrung above his absent chin , his bluish lips protruding as though he were blowing upon hot soup , making a high whinnying sound like a horse . Beyond the wall Miss Reba filled the hall , the house , with a harsh choking uproar of obscene cursing .   " BUT THAT GIRL , " Horace said . " She was all right . You know she was all right when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car with him . He was just giving her a lift to town . She was all right . You know she was all right . " The woman sat on the edge of the bed , looking down at the child . It lay beneath the faded , clean blanket , its hands upflung beside its head , as though it had died in the presence of an unbearable agony which had not had time to touch it . Its eyes were half open , the balls rolled back into the skull so that only the white showed , in color like weak milk . Its face was still damp with perspiration , but its breathing was easier . It no longer breathed is those weak , whistling gasps as it had when Horace en  --  tered the room . On a chair beside the bed sat a tumblerhalf full of faintly discolored water , with a spoon in it . Through the open window came the myriad noises of the square  --  cars , wagons , footsteps on the pavement IP157neath  --  and through it Horace could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between holes in the bare earth beneath the locust and water oaks . The woman brooded above the child . " Nobody wanted her out there . Lee has told them and told them they must not bring women out there , and I told her before it got dark they were not her kind of people and to get away from there . It was that fellow that brought her . IIe was out there on the porch with them , still drinking , because when he came in to supper he could n't hardly walk , even . He had n't even tried to wash the blood off of his face . Little shirt-tail boys that think because Lee breaks the law , they can come out there and treat our house like a . . . Grown people are bad , but at least they take buying whiskey like buying anything else ; it 's the ones like him , the ones that are too young to realise that people do nt break the law just for a holiday . " Horace could see her clenched hands writhing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I 'd hang every man that makes it or buys it or drinks it , every one of them . " But why must it have been me , us ? What had I ever done to her , to her kind ? I told her to get away from t here . I told her not to stay there until dark . But that fellowthat brought her was getting drunk again , and him and Van picking at each other . If she 'd just stopped runningaround where they had to look at her . She would n't stay anywhere . She 'd just dash out one door , and in a minute she 'd come running in from the other direction . And if he 'd just let Van alone , because Van had to go back on the truck at midnight , and so Popeye would have made him behave . And Saturday night too ,   and them sitting up all night drinking anyway , and I had gone through it and gone through it and I 'd tell Lee to let 's get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these spells like last night , and no doctor , no telephone . And then she had to come out there , after I had slaved for him , slaved for him . " Motionless , her head bent and her hands still in her lap , she had that spent immobilityof a chimney rising above the ruin of a house in the aftermath of a cyclone . " Standing there in the corner behind the bed , with that raincoat on . She was that scared , when they brought the fellow in , all bloody again . They laid him on the bed and Van hit him again and Lee caught Van 's arm , and her standing there with her eyes like the holes in one of these masks . The raincoat was hanging on the wall , and she had it on , over her coat . Her dress was all folded up on the bed . They threw the fellow right on top of it , blood and all , and I said God , are you drunk too ? ' But Lee just looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , like it gets when he 's drunk . " There was n't any lock on the door , but I thought that pretty soon they 'd have to go and see about the truck and , then I could do something . Then Lee made me go too , and he took the lamp out , so I had to wait until they went back to the porch before I could go back . I stood just inside the door . The fellow was snoring , in the he ( l there , breathing hard , with his nose and mouth all batteredup again , and I could hear them on the porch . ' I'hrn they would be outdoors , around the house and at the back too I could hear them . Then they got quiet . " I stood there , against the wall . He would snore atP159choke and catch his breath and moan , sort of , and I would think about that girl lying there in the dark , with her eyes open , listening to them , and me having to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do something . I told her to go away . I said What fault is it of mine if you 're not married ? I do nt want you here a bit more than you want to be here . ' I said I 've lived my life without any help from people of your sort ; what right have you got to look to me for help ? ' Because I 've done everything for him . I 've been in the dirt for him . I 've put everything behind me and all I asked was to be let alone . " Then I heard the door open . I could tell Lee by the way he breathes . He went to the bed and said I want the raincoat . Sit up and take it off ' and I could hear the shucks rattling while he took it off of her , then he went out . He just got the raincoat and went out . It was Van 's coat . " And I have walked around that house so much at night , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men that would n't lift a finger for him if he got caught , until I could tell any of them by the way they breathed , and I could tell Popeye by the smell of that stuff on his hair . Tommy was following him . He came in the door behind Popeye and looked at me and I could see his eyes , like a cat . Then his eyes went away and I could feel him sort of squatting against me , and we could hear Popeye over where the bed was and that fellowsnoring and snoring . " I could just hear little faint sounds , from the shucks , so I knew it was all right yet , and in a minute Popeye came on back , and Tommy followed him out , creepingp160along behind him , and I stood there until I heard them go down to the truck . Then I went to the bed . When I touched her she began to fight . I was trying to put my hand over her mouth so she could n't make a noise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thrashing about , rolling her head from one side to the other , holding to the coat . " You fool ! ' I says It 's me  --  the woman . ' " " But that girl , " Horace said . " She was all right . When you were coming back to the house the next morningafter the baby 's bottle , you saw her and knew she was all right . " The room gave onto the square . Through the window he-could see the young men pitching dollars in the courthouse yard , and the wagons passing or tethered about the hitching chains , and he could hear the footsteps and voices of people on the slow and unhurried pavementbelow the window ; the people buying comfortable things to take home and eat at quiet tables . " You know she was all right . " That night Horace went out to his sister 's , in a hired car ; he did not telephone . He found Miss Jenny in her room . " Well , " she said . " Narcissa will  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horace said . " Her nice , well  --  bred young man . Her Virginia gentleman . I know why ho did n't come back . " " Who ? Gowan ? " " Yes ; Gowan . And , by the Lord , he 'd better not cone back . By God , when I think that I had the opportu-nity- " What ? What did he do ? " .   " He carried a little fool girl out there with him that clay and got drunk and ran off and left her . That 's what lie did . If it had n't been for that woman  --  And when I think of people like that walking the earth with impunity just because he has a balloon-tailed suit and went through the astonishing experience of having attended Virginia . . . On any train or in any hotel , on the street ; anywhere , mind you  --  " " Oh , " Miss Jenny said . " I did n't understand at first who you meant . Well , " she said . " You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came ? the day he would n't stay for supper and went to Oxford ? " " Yes . And when I think how I could have  --  " " He asked Narcissa to marry him . She told him that one child was enough for her . " " I said she has no heart . She can not be satisfied with less than insult . " " So he got mad and said he would go to Oxford , where there was a woman he was reasonably confident he would not appear ridiculous to : something like that . Well . " She looked at him , her neck bowed to see across her spectacles . " I 'll declare , a male parent is a funny thing , but just let a man have a hand in the affairs of a femalethat 's no kin to him . . . What is it that makes a man think that the female flesh he marries or begets might misbehave , but all he did n't marry or get is bound to ? " " Yes , " Horace said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blood . I can reconcile myself to her having to be exposed to a scoundrel now and then , but to think that at any moment she may become involved with a fool . "   " Nell , what are you going to do about it ? Start some kind of roach campaign ? " " I 'm going to do what she said : I 'm going to have a law passed making it obligatory upon everyone to shoot any man less than fifty years old that makes , buys , sells or thinks whiskey . . . scoundrel I can face , but to think of her being exposed to any fool . .. . He returned to town . The night was warm , the darknessfilled with the sound of newfledged cicadas . He was using a bed , one chair , a bureau on which he had spread a towel and upon which lay his brushes , his watch , his pipe and tobacco pouch , and , propped against a book , a photograph of his step-daughter , Little Belle . Upon the glazed surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face came clear . He stood before it , looking at the sweet , inscrutable face which looked in turn at somethingjust beyond his shoulder , out of the dead cardboard . He was thinking of the grape arbor in Kinston , ofNY summer twilight and the murmur of voices darkeninginto silence as he approached , who meant them , her , noharm ; who meant her less than harm , good God ; darkeninginto the pale whisper of her white dress , of the delicate and urgent mammalian whisper of that curious small flesh which he had not begot and in which appeared to be vatted delicately some seething sympathy with the blossum'ng grape.  --  He moved , suddenly . As of its own accord the photographhad shifted , slipping a little from its precariousbalancing against the book . The image blurred into the highlight , like something familiar seen beneath disturbedthough clear water ; he looked at the familiar ini-P 163age with a kind of quiet horror and despair , at a face suddenolder in sin than he would ever be , a face more blurred than sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he knocked it flat ; whereupon once more the face mused tenderly behind the rigid travesty of the painted mouth , contemplating something beyond his shoulder . He lay in bed , dressed , with the light burning , until he heard the courthouse clock strike three . Then he left the house , putting his watch and his tobacco pouch into his pocket . The railroad station was three quarters of a mile away . The waiting room was lit by a single weak bulb . It was empty save for a man in overalls asleep on the bench , his head on his folded coat , snoring , and a woman in a calico dress , in a dingy shawl and a new hat trimmed with rigid and moribund flowers set square and awkward on her head . Her head was bent ; she may have been asleep ; her hands crossed on the paper-wrapped parcel upon her lap , a straw suit case at her feet . It was then that Horace found that he had forgot his pipe . The train came , finding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman got on , the man carrying his rumpled coat , the woman the parcel and the suit case . He followed them into the day coach filled with snoring , with bodies sprawled half into the aisle as though in the aftermath of a sudden and violent destruction , with dropped beads , open-mouthed , their throats turned profoundly upward as though waiting the stroke of knives . He dozed . The train clicked on , stopped , jolted . He waked and dozed again . Someone shook him out of sleepi into a primrose dawn , among unshaven puffy faces washed lightly over as though with the paling ultimate stain of a holocaust , blinking at one another with dead eyes into which personality returned in secret opaque waves . He got off , had breakfast , and took another accommodation , entering a car where a child wailed hopelessly , crunching peanut-shells under his feet as he moved up the car in a stale ammoniac odor until he found a seat beside a man . A moment later the man leaned forward and spat tobacco juice between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoking car . It was full too , the door between it and the Jim Crow car swingingopen . Standing in the aisle he could look forward into a diminishing corridor of green plush seat-backs topped by hatted cannonballs swaying in unison , while gusts of talk and laughter blew back and kept in steady motion the blue acrid air in which white men sat , spittinginto the aisle . He changed again . The waiting crowd was composed half of young men in collegiate clothes with small cryptic badges on their shirts and vests , and two girls with painted small faces and scant bright dresses like identical artificial flowers surrounded each by bright and restless bees . When the train came they pushed gaily forward , talking and laughing , shouldering aside older people with gay rudeness , clashing and slamming seats back an . settling themselves , turning their faces up out of laughter , their cold faces still toothed with it , as three middle . aged women moved down the car , looking tentatively left and right at the filled seats . The two girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting slender hands and preening not-quite-formless fingers about their close heads seen between the sprawled elbows and the leaning heads of two youths hanging over the back of the seat and surrounded by coloredhat bands at various heights where the owners sat on the seat arms or stood in the aisle ; and presently the conductor 's cap as he thrust among them with plaintive , fretful cries , like a bird . " Tickets . Tickets , please , " he chanted . For an instant they held him there , invisible save for his cap . Then two young men slipped swiftly back and into the seat behind Horace . He could hear them breathing . Forward the conductor'spunch clicked twice . He came on back . " Tickets , " he chanted . " Tickets . " " He took Horace 's and stopped where the youths sat . " You already got mine , " one said . " Up there . " " Where 's your check ? " the conductor said . " You never gave us any . You got our tickets , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glibly , in a frank , pleasant tone . " Did you notice the number of yours , Shack ? " The second one repeated a number in a frank , pleasant tone . " Sure you got ours . Look and see . " He began to whistle between his teeth , a broken dance rhythm , unmusical . " Do you eat at Gordon hall ? " the other said . " No . I have natural halitosis . " The conductor went on . The whistle reached crescendo , clapped off by his hands on his knees , ejaculating duh-duh-duh . Then he just squalled , meaningless , vertiginous ; to Horace it was like sitting before a series of printed pages turned in furious snatches , leaving a series of cryptic , headless and tailless evocations on the mind . " She 's travelled a thousand miles without a ticket . " " Marge too . " " Beth too . " " Duh-duh-duh . " " Marge too . " " I 'm going to punch mine Friday night . " " Eeeeyow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that far . " " Eeeeeyow . " They whistled , clapping their heels on the floor to furiouscrescendo , saying duh-duh-duh . The first jolted the seat back against Horace 's bead . He rose . " Come on , " he said . " He 's done gone . " Again the seat jarred into Horace and he watched them return and join the group that blocked the aisle , saw one of them lay his bold , rough hand flat upon one of the bright , soft faces uptilted to them . Beyond the group a countrywoman with an infant in her arms stood braced against a seat . From time to time she looked back at the blocked aisle and the empty seats beyond . At Oxford he descended into a throng of them at the station , hatless , in bright dresses , now and then with books in their hands and surrounded still by swarms of colored shirts . Impassable , swinging hands with their escorts , objects of casual and puppyish pawings , they dawdled up the hill toward the college , swinging their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as he stepped off the walk in order to pass them.  |p167At  the top of the hill three paths diverged through a broad grove beyond which , in green vistas , buildings in red brick or gray stone gleamed , and where a clear soprano bell began to ring . The procession became three streams , thinning rapidly upon the dawdling couples , swinging hands , strolling in erratic surges , lurching into one another with puppyish squeals , with the random intensepurposelessness of children . The broader path led to the postoffice . He entered and waited until the window was clear . " I 'm trying to find a young lady , Miss Temple Drake . I probably just missed her , did n't I ? " " She 's not here any longer , " the clerk said . " She quit school about two weeks ago . " He was young : a dull , smooth face behind horn glasses , the hair meticulous . After a time Horace heard himself asking quietly : " You do nt know where she went ? " The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Are you another detective ? " " Yes , " Horace said , " yes . No matter . It does n't matter . " Then he was walking quietly down the steps , into the sunlight again . He stood there while on both sides of him they passed in a steady stream of little colored dresses , bare-armed , with close bright heads , with that identical cool , innocent , unabashed expression which he knew well in their eyes , above the savage identical paint upon their mouths ; like music moving , like honey poured in sunlight , pagan and evanescent and serene , thinly evocative of all lost days and outpaced delights , in the sun . Bright , trembling with heat , it lay in open glades of miragelike glimpses of stone or brick : columns without tops , towers apparently floating above a green cloud in slow ruin against the southwest wind , sinister , imponderable , bland ; and he standing there listening to the sweet cloistralbell , thinking Now what ? What now ? and answering himself : Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the station an hour before the train was due , a filled but unlighted cob pipe in his hand . In the lavatory he saw , scrawled on the foul , stained wall , her pencilled name . Temple Drake . He read it quietly , his head bent , slowly fingering the unlighted pipe . A half hour before the train came they began to gather , strolling down the hill and gathering along the platform with thin , bright , raucous laughter , their blonde legs monotonous , their bodies moving continually inside their scant garments with that awkward and voluptuous purposelessnessof the young . The return train carried a pullman . He went on through the day coach and entered it . There was only one other occupant : a man in the center of the car , next the window , bareheaded , leaning back , his elbow on the window sill and an unlighted cigar in his ringed hand . When the train drew away , passing the sleek crowds in increasing reverse , the other passenger rose and went forward towardthe day coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soiled , light-colored felt hat . With the corner of his eye Horace saw his hand fumbling at his breast pocket , and he remarked the severe trim of hair across the man 's vast , soft , white neck . Like with a guillotine , Horace thought , watching the man sidle past the porter in the aisle and vanish , passing out of his sight and his mind in the act of flinging the hat onto his head . The train spedp169on , swaying on the curves , flashing past an occasional house , through cuts and across valleys where young cottonwheeled slowly in fanlike rows . The train checked speed ; a jerk came back , and four whistle-blasts . The man in the soiled hat entered , taking a cigar from his breast pocket . He came down the aisle swiftly , looking at Horace . He slowed , the cigar in his fingers . The train jolted again . The man flung his hand out and caught the back of the seat facing Horace . " Ai nt this Judge Benbow ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mark of age or thought whatever  --  a majestic sweep of flesh on either side of a small blunt nose , like looking out over a mesa , yet withal some indefinable quality of delicate paradox , as though the Creator had completed his joke by lighting the munificent expenditure of putty with something originallyintended for some weak , acquisitive creature like a squirrel or a rat . " Do nt I address Judge Benbow ? " he said , offering his hand . " I 'm Senator Snopes , Cla'ence Snopes . " " Oh , " Horace said , " yes . Thanks , " he said , " but I 'm afraid you anticipate a little . Hope , rather . " The other waved the cigar , the other hand , palm-up , the third finger discolored faintly at the base of a huge ring , in Horace 's face . Horace shook it and freed his hand . " I thought I recognised you when you got on at Oxford , " Snopes said , " but I  --  May I set down ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leg . He flung the overcoat  --  ashoddy blue garment with a greasy velvet collar  --  onthe seat and sat down as the train stopped . " Yes , sir , I 'm always glad to see any of the boys , any time . .. " P170He leaned across Horace and peered out the window at a small dingy station with its cryptic bulletin board chalked over , an express truck bearing a wire chicken coop containing two forlorn fowls , three or four men in overalls gone restfully against the wall , chewing . " ' Course you ai nt in my county no longer , but what I say a man 's friends is his friends , whichever way they vote . Because a friend is a friend , and whether he can do anything for me or not . . . " He leaned back , the unlighted cigar in his fingers . " You ai nt come all the way up from the big town , then . " " No , " Horace said . " Any time you 're in Jackson , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my county . Do nt no man stay so busy he ai nt got time for his old friends , what I say . Let 's see , you 're in Kinston , now , ai nt you ? I know your senators . Fine men , both of them , but I just taint call their names . " " I really could n't say , myself , " Horace said . The train started . Snopes leaned into the aisle , looking back . His light gray suit had been pressed but not cleaned . " Well , " he said . He rose and took up the overcoat . " Any time you 're in the city . . . You going to Jefferson , 1 reckon ? " " Yes , " Horace said . " I 'll see you again , then . " " Why not ride back here ? " Horace said . " You 'll find it more comfortable . " " I 'm going up and have a smoke , ' Snopes said , waving the cigar . " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are n't any ladies . " " Sure , " Snopes said . " I 'll see you at Holly Springs . " He went on back toward the day coach and passed out of sight with the cigar in his mouth . Horace remembered him ten years ago as a hulking , dull youth , son of a restaurant-owner , member of a family which had been movingfrom the Frenchman 's Bend neighborhood into Jeffersonfor the past twenty years , in sections ; a family of enough ramifications to have elected him to the legislaturewithout recourse to a public polling . He sat quite still , the cold pipe in his hand . He rose and went forward through the day coach , then into the smoker . Snopes was in the aisle , his thigh draped over the arm of a seat where four men sat , using the unlighted cigar to gesture with . Horace caught his eye and beckoned from the vestibule . A moment later Snopes joined him , the overcoat on his arm . " How are things going at the capital ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh , assertive voice . There emerged gradually a picture of stupid chicanery and petty corruption for stupid and petty ends , conductedprincipally in hotel rooms into which bellboys whisked with bulging jackets upon discreet flicks of skirts in swift closet doors . " Any time you 're in town , " he said . " I always like to show the boys around . Ask anybody in town ; they 'll tell you if it 's there , Cla'ence Snopes 'll know where it is . You got a pretty tough case up home there , what I hear . " " Cant tell yet , " Horace said . He said : " I stopped off at Oxford today , at the university , speaking to some of my step-daughter 's friends . One of her best friends is no longer in school there . A young lady from Jackson named Temple Drake . " Snopes was watching him with thick , small , opaque eyes . " Oh , yes ; Judge Drake 's gal , " he said . " The one that ran away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home , did she ? What was the trouble ? Fail in her work ? " " I do nt know . When it come out in the paper folks thought she 'd run off with some fellow . One of them cornpanionatemarriages . ' " But when she turned up at home , they knew it was n't that , I reckon . Well , well , Belle 'll be surprised . What 's she doing now ? Running around Jackson , I suppose ? " " She ai nt there . " " Not ? " Horace said . He could feel the other watching him . " Where is she ? " " Her paw sent her up north somewhere , with an aunt . Michigan . It was in the papers couple days later . " " Oh , " Horace said . He still held the cold pipe , and he discovered his hand searching his pocket for a match . Ile drew a deep breath . " That Jackson paper 's a pretty good paper . It 's considered the most reliable paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Snopes said . " You was at Oxford trying to locateher ? " " No , no . I just happened to meet a friend of my daughterwho told me she had left school . Well , I 'll see you at Holly Springs . " " Sure , " Snopes said . Horace returned to the pullman and sat down and lit the pipe . When the train slowed for Holly Springs he went tp173the vestibule , then he stepped quickly back into the car . Snopes emerged from the day coach as the porter opened the door and swung down the step , stool in hand . Snopes descended . He took something from his breast pocket and gave it to the porter . " Here , George , " he said , " have a cigar . " Horace descended . Snopes went on , the soiled hat toweringhalf a head above any other . Horace looked at the porter . " He gave it to you , did he ? " The porter chucked the cigar on his palm . He put it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Horace said . " I would n't give it to nobody I know , " the porter said . " Does he do this very often ? " " Three-four times a year . Seems like I always git him , too . . . Thank ' sub . " Horace saw Snopes enter the waiting-room ; the soiled hat , the vast neck , passed again out of his mind . He filled the pipe again . From a block away he heard the Memphis-bound train come in . It was at the platform when he reached the station . Beside the open vestibule Snopes stood , talking with two youths in new straw hats , with something vaguely mentorial about his thick shoulders and his gestures . The train whistled . The two youths got on . Horace stepped back around the corner of the station . When his train came he saw Snopes get on ahead of him and enter the smoker . Horace knocked out his pip ( and entered the day coach and found a seat at the real facing backward . P174AS HORACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was the taxi which he used to go out to his sister 's . " I 'll give you a ride , this time , " the driver said . " Much obliged , " Horace said . He got in . When the car entered the square , the courthouse clock said only twenty minutes past eight , yet there was no light in the hotel room window . " Maybe the child 's asleep , " Horace said . He said , " If you 'll just drop me at the hotel  --  " Then he found that the driver was watching him , with a kind of discreet curiosity . " You been out of town today , " the driver said . " Yes , " Horace said . " What is it ? What happened here today ? " " She ai nt staying at the hotel any more . I heard Mrs Walker taken her in at the jail . " " Oh , " Horace said . " I 'll get out at the hotel . " The lobby was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iron-gray man with a toothpick , hisp175vest open upon a neat paunch . The woman was not there . " It 's these church ladies , " he said . He lowered his voice , the toothpick in his fingers . " They come in this morning . A committee of them . You know how it is , I reckon . " " You mean to say you let the Baptist church dictate who your guests shall be ? " " It 's them ladies . You know how it is , once they get set on a thing . A man might just as well give up and do like they say . Of course , with me  --  " " By God , if there was a man  --  " " Shhhhhh , " the proprietor said . " You know how it is when them  --  " " But of course there was n't a man who would  --  And you call yourself one , that 'll let  --  " " I got a certain position to keep up myself , " the proprietor said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " He stepped back a little , against the desk . " I reckon I can say who 'll stay in my house and who wont , " he said . " And I know some more folks around here that better do the same thing . Not no mile off , neither . I ai nt beholden to no man . Not to you , noways . " " Where is she now ? or did they drive her out of town ? " " That ai nt my affair , where folks go after they check out , " the proprietor said , turning his back . He said : " I reckon somebody took her in , though . " " Yes , " Horace said . " Christians . Christians . " He turned toward the door . The proprietor called him . He turned . The other was taking a paper down from a pigeon-hole . Horace returned to the desk . The paper lay on the desk . The proprietor leaned with his hands on the desk , the toothpick tilted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said . He paid the bill , counting the money down with shakinghands . He entered the jail yard and went to the door and knocked . After a while a lank , slattern woman came with a lamp , holding a man 's coat across her breast . She peered at him and said before he could speak : " You 're lookin fer Miz Goodwin , I reckon . " " Yes . How did  --  Did  --  " " You 're the lawyer . I 've seed you befo . She 's hyer . Sleepin now . " " Thanks , " Horace said . " Thanks . I knew that someone  --  I did n't believe that  --  " " I reckon I kin always find a bed fer a woman and child , " the woman said . " I do nt keer whut Ed says . Was you wantin her special ? She 's sleepin now . " " No , no ; I just wanted to  --  " The woman watched him across the lamp . " ' Taint no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mawnin and git her a boa'din-place . ' Taint no hurry . " On the next afternoon Horace went out to his sister 's , again in a hired car . Iie told her what had happened . " I'Il have to take her home now . " " Not into my house , " Narcissa said . He looked at her . Then he began to fill his pipe slowly and carefully . " It 's not a matter of choice , my dear . You must see that . " " Not in my house , " Narcissa said . " I thought we settled that . " He struck the match and lit the pipe and put the match carefully into the fireplace . " Do you realise thatP177she has been practically turned into the streets ? That  --  " " That should n't be a hardship . She ought to be used to that . " He looked at her . He put the pipe in his mouth and smoked it to a careful coal , watching his hand tremble upon the stem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave town . Just because she happens not to be married to the man whose child she carries about these sanctified streets . But who told them ? That 's what I want to know . I know that nobody in Jefferson knew it except  --  " " You were the first I heard tell it , " Miss Jenny said . " But , Narcissa , why  --  " " Not in my house , " Narcissa said . " Well , " Horace said . He drew the pipe to an even coal . " That settles it , of course , " he said , in a dry , light voice . She rose . " Will you stay here tonight ? " " What ? No . No . I 'll  --  I told her I 'd come for her at the jail and . . . " He sucked at his pipe . " Well , I do n't suphoseit matters . I hope it does n't . " She was still paused , turning . " Will you stay or not ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace said . " Time 's not such a bad thing after all . Use it right , and you can stretch anything out , like a rubberband , until it busts somewhere , and there you are , with all tragedy and despair in two little knots between thumb and finger of each hand . " " Will you stay , or wont you stay , Horace ? " Narcissa said . " I think I 'll stay , " Horace said . He was in bed . He had been lying in the dark for about an hour , when the door of the room opened , felt rather than seen or heard . It was his sister . He rose to his elbow . She took shape vaguely , approaching the bed . She came and looked down at him . " How much longer are you goingto keep this up ? " she said . " Just until morning , " he said . " I 'm going back to town . You need not see me again . " She stood beside the bed , motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him : " You know what I mean . " " I promise not to bring her into your house again . You can send Isom in to hide in the canna bed . " She said nothing . " Surely you do n't object to my living there , do you ? " " I do nt care where you live . The question is , where I live . I live here , in this town . I 'll have to stay here . But you 're a man . It does n't matter to you . You can go away . " " Oh , " he said . He lay quite still . She stood above him , motionless . They spoke quietly , as though they were dis-cussing wall paper , food . " Do nt you see , this is my home , where I must spend the rest of my life . Where I was born . I do nt care where else you go nor what you do . I do nt care how many women you have nor who they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman people are talking about . I do nt expect you to have consideration for me ; I ask you to have consideration for our father and mother . Take her to Memphis . They say you refused to let the man have bond to get out of jail ; take her on to Memphis . You can think of a lie to tell him about that , too . " " Oh . So you think that , do you ? "   " I do nt think anything about it . I do n't care . That 's what people in town think . So it does n't matter whether it 's true or not . What I do mind is , every day you force me to have to tell lies for you . Go away from here , Horace . Anybody but you would realise it 's a case of coldbloodedmurder . " " And over her , of course . I suppose they say that too , out of their odorous and omnipotent sanctity . Do they say yet that it was I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes any difference who did it . The question is , are you going to stay mixed up with it ? When people already believe you and she are slipping into my house at night . " " Her cold , unbending voice shaped the words in the darkness above him . Through the window , upon the blowing darkness , came the drowsy dissonance of cicada and cricket . " Do you believe that ? " he said . " It does n't matter what I believe . Go on away , Horace . I ask it . " " And leave her  --  them , flat ? " " Hire a lawyer , if he still insists he 's innocent . I 'll pay for it . You can get a better criminal lawyer than you are . She wont know it . She wont even care . Cant you see that she is just leading you on to get him out of jail for nothing ? Do nt you know that woman has got money hidden away somewhere ? You 're going back into town tomorrow , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackness . " You wont leave before breakfast . " The next morning at breakfast , his sister said : " Who will be the lawyer on the other side of the case ? "  | " District Attorney . Why ? " She rang the bell and sent for fresh bread . Horace watched her . " Why do you ask that ? " Then he said : " Damn little squirt . " He was talking about the District Attorney , who had also been raised in Jefferson and who had gone to the town school with them . " I believe he was at the bottom of that business night before last . The hotel . Getting her turned out of the hotel for public effect , politicalcapital . By God , if I knew that , believed that he had done that just to get elected to Congress . .. " After Horace left , Narcissa went up to Miss Jenny 's room . " Who is the District Attorney ? " she said . " You 've known him all your life , " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham . What do you want to know for ? Are you looking around for a substitute for Gowan Stevens ? " " I just wondered , " Narcissa said . " Fiddlesticks , " Miss Jenny said . " You do nt wonder . You just do things and then stop until the next time to do something comes around . " Horace met Snopes emerging from the barbershop , his jowls gray with powder , moving in an effluvium of pomade . In the bosom of his shirt , beneath his bow tie , lie wore an imitation ruby stud which matched his ring . The tie was of blue polka-dots ; the very white spots on it appeareddirty when seen close ; the whole man with his shaved neck and pressed clothes and gleaming shoes emanated somehow the idea that he had been dry-cleaned rather than washed . " Well , Judge , " he said , " I hear you 're having some troublegettin a boarding-place for that client of yourn . Like IP181always say  --  " he leaned , his voice lowered , his mud-col-I ored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place in politics , and women ai nt got no place in neither one , let alone the law . Let them stay at home and they 'll find plenty to do without upsetting a man 's law-suit . And besides , a man ai nt no more than human , and what he does ai nt nobody 's business but his . What you done with her ? " " She 's at the jail , " Horace said . He spoke shortly , makingto pass on . The other blocked his way with an effect of clumsy accident . " You got them all stirred up , anyhow . Folks is saying you would n't git Goodwin no bond , so he 'd have to stay  --  " again Horace made to pass on . " Half the trouble in this world is caused by women , I always say . Like that girl gittin her paw all stirred up , running off like she ( lone . I reckon he done the right thing sending her clean outen the state . " " Yes , " Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm mighty glad to hear your case is going all right . Between you and me , I 'd like to see a good lawyer make a monkey outen that District Attorney . Give a fellow like that a little county office and he gits too big for his pants right away . Well , glad to 've saw you . I got some business up town for a day or two . I do nt reckon you 'll be going up that-a-way ? " " What ? " Horace said . " Up where ? " " Memphis . Anything I can do for you ? " " No , " Horace said . He went on . For a short distance he could not see at all . He tramped steadily , the muscles beside his jaws beginning to ache , passing people who spoke to him , unawares . P181AS THE TRAIN neared Memphis Virgil Snopes ceased talkingand began to grow quieter and quieter , while on the contrary his companion , eating from a paraffin-paper package of popcorn and molasses , grew livelier and livelier with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of his friend . He was still talking away when , carrying their new , imitation leather suit cases , their new hats slanted above their shaven necks , they descended at the station . In the wailing room Fonzo said : " Well , what 're we going to do first ? " Virgil said nothing . Someone jostled them : Fonzo caught at his lat . " What we going to do ? " he said . Then he looked at Virgil , at his face . " What 's the matter ? " " Ai nt nothing the matter , " Virgil said . " Well , what 're we going to do ? You been here before . I ai nt . " " I reckon we better kind of look around , " Virgil said.  |p183Fonzo  was watching him , his blue eyes like china . " What 's the matter with you ? All the time on the train you was talking about how many times you been to Memphis . I bet you ai nt never bu  --  " Someone jostled them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow between them . Clutching his suit case and hat Fonzo fought his way back to his friend . " I have , too , " Virgil said , looking glassily about . " Well , what we going to do then ? It wont be open till eight oclock in the morning . " " What you in such a rush for , then ? " " Well , I do nt aim to stay here all night . . . . What did you do when you was here before ? " " Went to the hotel , " Virgil said . " Which one ? They got more than one here . You reckon all these folks could stay in one hotel ? Which one was it ? " Virgil 's eyes were also a pale , false blue . He looked glassily about . " The Gayoso hotel , " he said . " Well , let 's go to it , " Fonzo said . They moved toward the exit . A man shouted " taxi " at them ; a redcap tried to take Fonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing it back . On the street more cabmen barked at them . " So this is Memphis , " Fonzo said . " Which way is it , now ? " He had no answer . He looked around and saw Virgil in the act of turning away from a cabman . " What you  --  " " Up this way , " Virgil said . " It ai nt far . " It was a mile and a half . From time to time they swapped hands with the bags . " So this is Memphis , " Fonzo said . " Where have I been all my life ? " When they entered the Gayoso a porter offered to take the bags . They brushed past him and entered , walking gingerly on the tile floor . Virgil stopped . " Come on , " Fonzo said . " Wait , " Virgil said . " Thought you was here before , " Fonzo said . " I was . This hyer place is too high . They 'll want a dollara day here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's kind of look around . " They returned to the street . It was five oclock . They went on , looking about , carrying the suit cases . They came to another hotel . Looking in they saw marble , brass cuspidors , hurrying bellboys , people sitting among potted plants . " That un 'll be just as bad , " Virgil said . " What we going to do then ? We taint walk around all night . " " Let 's git off this hyer street , " Virgil said . They left Main Street . At the next corner Virgil turned again . " Let 's look down this-a-way . Git away from all that ere plate glass and monkey niggers . That 's what you have to pay for in them places . " " Why ? It 's already bought when we got there . How come we have to pay for it ? " " Suppose somebody broke it while we was there . Supposethey could n't ketch who done it . Do you reckon they 'd let us out withouten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow dingy street of frame houses and junk yards . Presently they came to a three-storey house in a small grassless yard . Before thep185entrance a lattice-work false entry leaned . On the steps sat a big woman in a mother hubbard , watching two fluffy white dogs which moved about the yard . " Let 's try that um " Fonzo said . " That ai nt no hotel . Where 's ere sign ? " " Why ai nt it ? " Fonzo said . " ' Course it is . Who ever heard of anybody just living in a three-storey house ? " " We cant go in this-a-way , " Virgil said . " This hyer 's the back . Do nt you see that privy ? " jerking his head toward the lattice . " Well , let 's go around to the front , then , " Fonzo said . " Come on . " They went around the block . The opposite side was filled by a row of automobile salesrooms . They stood in the middle of the block , their suit cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was ever here before , noways , " Fonzo said . " Let 's go back . That must a been the front . " " With the privy built onto the front door ? " Fonzo said . " We can ask that lady . " " Who can ? I ai nt . " " Let 's go back and see , anyway " They returned . The woman and the dogs were gone . " Now you done it , " Fonzo said . " Ai nt you ? " " Let 's wait a while . Maybe she 'll come back . " " It 's almost seven oclock , " Fonzo said . They set the bags down beside the fence . The lights had come on , quivering high in the serried windows against the tall serene western sky . " I can smell ham , too , " Fonzo said.  | A cab drew up . A plump blonde woman got out , followed by a man . They watched them go up the walk and enter the lattice . Fonzo sucked his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered . " Maybe it 's her husband , " Virgil said . Fonzo picked up his bag . " Come on . " " Wait , " Virgil said . " Give them a little time . " They waited . The man came out and got in the cal ) and went away . " Caint be her husband , " Fonzo said . " I would n't a never left . Come on . " He entered the gate . " Wait , " Virgil said . " You can , " Fonzo said . Virgil took his bag and followed . He stopped while Fonzo opened the lattice gingerlyand peered in . " Aw , hell , " he said . He entered . There was another door , with curtained glass . Fonzo knocked . " Why did n't you push that ere button ? " Virgil said . " Do nt you know city folks do nt answer no knock ? " " All right , " Fonzo said . He rang the bell . The door opened . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs behind her . " Got ere extra room ? " Fonzo said . Miss Reba looked at them , at their new hats and the suit cases . " Who sent you here ? " she said . " Did n't nobody . We just picked it out . " Miss Reba looked at him . " Them hotels is too high . " Miss Reba breathed harshly . " What you boys doing ? ' " We come hyer on business , " Fonzo said . " We aim to stay a good spell . "  | " If it ai nt too high , " Virgil said . Miss Reba looked at him . " Where you from , honey ? " They told her , and their names . " We aim to be hyer a month or more , if it suits us . " " Why , I reckon so , " she said after a while . She looked at them . " I can let you have a room , but I 'll have to charge you extra whenever you do business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " " We ai nt , " Fonzo said . " We 'll do our business at the college . " " What college ? " Miss Reba said . " The barber 's college , " Fonzo said . " Look here , " Miss Reba said , " you little whipper-snapper . " Then she began to laugh , her hand at her breast . They watched her soberly while she laughed in harsh gasps . " Lord , Lord , " she said . " Come in here . " The room was at the top of the house , at the back . Miss Reba showed them the bath . When she put her hand on the door a woman 's voice said : " Just a minute , dearie " and the door opened and she passed them , in a kimono . They watched her go up the hall , rocked a little to their young foundations by a trail of scent which she left . Fonzo nudged Virgil surreptitiously . In their room again he said : " That was another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big boy ; I 'm heading for the henhouse . " They did n't go to sleep for some time that first night , what with the strange bed and room and the voices . They could hear the city , evocative and strange , imminentand remote ; threat and promise both  --  a deep , steady sound upon which invisible lights glittered andp188wavered : colored coiling shapes of splendor in which alreadywomen were beginning to move in suave attitudes of new delights and strange nostalgic promises . Fonzo thought of himself surrounded by tier upon tier of drawn shades , rose-colored , beyond which , in a murmur of silk , in panting whispers , the apotheosis of his youth assumed a thousand avatars . Maybe it 'll begin tomorrow , he thought ; maybe by tomorrow night . . . A crack of light came over the top of the shade and sprawled in a spreading fan upon the ceiling . Beneath the window he could hear a voice , a woman 's , then a man 's : they blended , murmured ; a door closed . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift hard heels of a woman . He began to hear sounds in the house : voices , laughter ; a mechanical piano began to play . " Hear them ? " Ile whispered . " She 's got a big family , I reckon , " Virgil said , his voice already dull with sleep . " Family , hell , " Fonzo said . " It 's a party . Wish I was to it . " On the third day as they were leaving the house in the morning , Miss Reba met them at the door . She wanted to use their room in the afternoons while they were absent . There was to be a detective 's convention in town and business would look up some , she said . " Your things 'll be all right . I 'll have Minnie lock everything ubeforehand . Ai nt nobody going to steal nothing from you in my house . " " What business you reckon she 's in ? " Fonzo said when they reached the street.  | " Do nt know , " Virgil said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fonzo said . " With all them women in kimonos and such running around . " " Would n't do you no good , " Virgil said . " They 're all married . Ai nt you heard them ? " The next afternoon when they returned from the school they found a woman 's undergarment under the washstand . . . Fonzo picked it up . " She 's a dressmaker , " he said . " Reckon so , " Virgil said . " Look and see if they taken anything of yourn . " The house appeared to be filled with people who did not sleep at night at all . They could hear them at all hours , running up and down the stairs , and always Fonzo would be conscious of women , of female flesh . It got to where he seemed to lie in his celibate bed surrounded by women , and he would lie beside the steadily snoring Virgil , his ears strained for the murmurs , the whispers of silk that came through the walls and the floor , that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the plaster , thinking that he had been in Memphis ten days , yet the extent of his acquaintance was a few of his fellow pupils at the school . After Virgil was asleep he would rise and unlock the door and leave it ajar , but nothing happened . On the twelfth day he told Virgil they were going visiting , with one of the barber-students . " Where ? " Virgil said . " That 's all right . You come on . I done found out something . And when I think I been here two weeks without knowing about it  --  "  | " What 's it going to cost ? " Virgil said . " When 'd you ever have any fun for nothing ? " Fonzo said . " Come on . " " I 'll go , " Virgil said . " But I ai nt going to promise to spend nothing . " " You wait and say that when we get there , " Fonzo said . The barber took them to a brothel . When they came out Fonzo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without never knowing about that house . " " I wisht you had n't never learned , " Virgil said . " It cost three dollars . " " Was n't it worth it ? " Fonzo said . " Ai nt nothing worth three dollars you taint tote off with you , " Virgil said . When they reached home Fonzo stopped . " We got to sneak in , now , " he said . " If she was to find out where we been and what we been doing , she might not let us stay in the house with them ladies no more . " " That 's so , " Virgil said . " Durn you . Hyer you done made me spend three dollars , and now you fixing to git us both throwed out . " " You do like I do , " Fonzo said . " That 's all you got to do . Do nt say nothing . " Minnie let them in . The piano was going full blast . Miss Reba appeared in a door , with a tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " you boys been out mighty late tonight . " " Yessum , " Fonzo said , prodding Virgil toward the stairs . " We been to prayer-meeting . " In bed , in the dark , they could still hear the piano.  | " You made me spend three dollars , " Virgil said . " Aw , shut up , " Fonzo said . " When I think I been here for two whole weeks almost .. . " The next afternoon they came home through the dusk , with the lights winking on , beginning to flare and gleam , and the women on their twinkling blonde legs meeting men and getting into automobiles and such . " How about that three dollars now ? " Fonzo said . " I reckon we better not go over tonight , " Virgil said . " It 'll cost too much . " " That 's right , " Fonzo said . " Somebody might see us and tell her . " They waited two nights . " Now it 'll be six dollars , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fonzo said . When they returned home Fonzo said : " Try to act like something , this time . She near about caught us before on account of the way you acted . " " What if she does ? " Virgil said in a sullen voice . " She caint eat us . " They stood outside the lattice , whispering . " How you know she caint ? " Fonzo said . " She do nt want to , then . " " How you know she do nt want to ? " " Maybe she do nt , " Virgil said . Fonzo opened the latticedoor . " I caint eat that six dollars , noways , " Virgil said . " Wisht I could . " Minnie let them in . She said : " Somebody huntin you all . " They waited in the hall . " We done caught now , " Virgil said . " I told you about throwing that money away . "  | " Aw , shut up , " Fonzo said . A man emerged from a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , his arm about a blonde woman in a red dress . " There 's Cla'ence , " Virgil said . In their room Clarence said : " How 'd you get into this place ? " " Just found it , " Virgil said . They told him about it . He sat on the bed , in his soiled hat , a cigar in his fingers . " Where you been tonight ? " he said . They did n't answer . They looked at him with blank , watchful faces . " Come on . I know . Where was it ? " They told him . " Cost me three dollars , too , " Virgil said . " I 'll be durned if you ai nt the biggest fool this side of Jackson , " Clarence said . " Come on here . " They followed sheepishly . He led them from the house and for three or four blocks . They crossed a street of Negro stores and theatres and turned into a narrow , dark street arul stopped at a house with red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could hear music inside , and shrill voices , and feet . They were admitted into a bare hallway where two shabby Negro men argued with a drunk white man in greasy overalls . Through an open door they saw a room filled Zvi t I i coffee-colored women in bright dresses , with ornate hair and golden smiles . " Them 's niggers , " Virgil said . " ' Course they 're niggers , " Clarence said . " But see this ? " he waved a banknote in his cousin 's face . " This stuff is color-blind. "  |p192ON  THE THIRD DAY of his search , Horace found a domicilefor the woman and child . It was in the ramshackle house of an old half-crazed white woman who was believedto manufacture spells for Negroes . It was on the edge of town , set in a tiny plot of ground choked and massed with waist-high herbage in an unbroken jungle across the front . At the back a path had been trodden from the broken gate to the door . All night a dim light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost any hour of the twenty-four a wagon or a buggy might be seen tethered in the lane behind it and a Negro enteringor leaving the back door . The house had been entered once by officers searching for whiskey . They found nothing save a few dried bunches of weeds , and a collection of dirty bottles containingliquid of which they could say nothing surely save that it was not alcoholic , while the old woman , held by two men , her lank grayish hair shaken before the glit- tering collapse of her face , screamed invective at them in her cracked voice . In a lean-to shed room containing a bed and a barrel of anonymous refuse and trash in which mice rattled all night long , the woman found a home . " You 'll be all right here , " Horace said . " You can always get me by telephone , at  --  " giving her the name of a neighbor . " No : wait ; tomorrow I 'll have the telephone put back in . Then you can  --  " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be coming out here . " " Why ? Do you think that would  --  that I 'd care a damn what  --  " " You have to live here . " " I 'm damned if I do . I 've already let too many women run my affairs for me as it is , and if these uxorious .. . " But he knew he was just talking . He knew that she knew it too , out of that feminine reserve of unflagging suspicionof all people 's actions which seems at first to be mere affinity for evil but which is in reality practical wisdom . " I guess I 'll find you if there 's any need , " she said . " There 's not anything else I could do . " " By God , " Horace said , " do nt you let them . . . Bitches , " he said ; " bitches . " The next day he had the telephone installed . He dill not see his sister for a week ; she had no way of learning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the openingof Court , the telephone shrilled into the quiet wbere he sat reading one evening , he thought it was Narcissa until , across a remote blaring of victrola or radio music , a man 's voice spoke in a guarded , tomblike tone.  | " This is Snopes , " it said . " Howie you , judge ? " " What ? " Horace said . " Who is it ? " " Senator Snopes , Cla'ence Snopes . " The victrola blared , faint , far away ; he could see the man , the soiled hat , the thick shoulders , leaning above the instrument  --  in a drugstore or a restaurant  --  whispering into it behind a soft , huge , ringed hand , the telephone toylike in the other . " Oh , " Horace said . " Yes ? What is it ? " " I got a little piece of information that might interest you . " Information that would interest me ? " " I reckon so . That would interest a couple of parties . " Against Horace 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saxophones . Obscene , facile , they seemed to be quarreling with one another like two dextrousmonkeys in a cage . He could hear the gross breathingof the man at the other end of the wire . " All right , " he said . " What do you know that would interest me ? " " I 'll let you judge that . " " All right . I 'll be down town in the morning . You can find me somewhere . " Then he said immediately : " Hello ! " The man sounded as though he were breathing in Horace 's ear : a placid , gross sound , suddenly portentous somehow . " Hello ! " Horace said . " It evidently do nt interest you , then . I reckon I 'll clicker with the other party and not trouble you no more . Goodbye . " " No ; wait , " Horace said . " Hello ! Hello ! " " Yeuh ? "  | " I 'll come down tonight . I 'll be there in about fif-teen  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I got my car . I 'll drive up there . " Ile walked down to the gate . There was a moon tonight . Within the black-and-silver tunnel of cedars firefliesdrifted in fatuous pinpricks . The cedars were black and pointed on the sky like a paper silhouette ; the slopinglawn had a faint sheen , a patina like silver . Somewherea whippoorwill called , reiterant , tremulous , plaintfulabove the insects . Three cars passed . The fourth slowed and swung toward the gate . Horace stepped into the light . Behind the wheel Snopes loomed bulkily , giving the impression of having been inserted into the car before the top was put on . He extended his hand . " How 're you tonight , judge ? Did n't know you was living in town again until I tried to call you out to Mrs Sar-toris 's . " " Well , thanks , " Horace said . He freed his hand . " What 's this you 've got hold of ? " Snopes creased himself across the wheel and peered out beneath the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horace said . " Save you having to turn around . " " It ai nt very private here , " Snopes said . " But that 's for you to say . " Huge and thick he loomed , hunched , his featureless face moonlike itself in the refraction of thr moon . Horace could feel Snopes watching him , witli that sense of portent which had come over the wire ; a quality calculating and cunning and pregnant . It seems d to him that he watched his mind flicking this way andp197that , striking always that vast , soft , inert bulk , as though it were caught in an avalanche of cottonseed-hulls . " Let 's go to the house , " Horace said . Snopes opened the door . " Go on , " Horace said , " I 'll walk up . " Snopes drove on . He was getting out of the car when Horace overtook Iiim . " Well , what is it ? " Horace said . Again Snopes looked at the house . " Keeping batch , : ire you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I always say , every married man ought to have a little place of leis own , where he can git off to himself without it being nobody 's business what he does . ' Course a man owes something to his wife , but what they do nt know taint hurt them , does it ? Long 's he does that , I taint see where she 's got ere kick coming . Ai nt that what you say ? " " She 's not here , " Horace said , " if that 's what you 're hinting it . What did you want to see me about ? " Again he felt Snopes watching him , the unabashed stare calculating and completely unbelieving . " Well , I always say , taint nobody tend to a man 's private businessbut himself . I ai nt blaming you . But when you know me better , you 'll know I ai nt loose-mouthed . I been around . I been there .... Have a cigar ? " His big hand flicked to his breast and offered two cigars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , his face coming out of the match like a pie set on edge . " What did you want to see me about ? " Horace said . Snopes puffed the cigar . " Couple days ago I come onto a piece of information which will be of value to you , if I ai nt mistook . " " Oh . Of value . What value ? "  | " I 'll leave that to you . I got another party I could dicker with , but being as me and you was fellow-towns- 1 men and all that . " Here and there Horace 's mind flicked and darted . Snopes ' family originated somewhere near Frenchman 's Bend and still lived there . He knew of the devious means by which information passed from man to man of that illiterate race which populated that section of the county . But surely it cant be something he 'd try to sell to the State , he thought . Even he is not that big a fool . " You 'd better tell me what it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him . " You remember one day you got on the train at Oxford , where you 'd been on some bus  --  " " Yes , " Horace said . Snopes puffed the cigar to an even coal , carefully , at some length . He raised his hand and drew it across the back of his neck . " You recall speaking to me about a girl . " " Yes . Then what ? " " That 's for you to say . " He could smell the honeysuckle as it bore up the silver slope , and he heard the whippoorwill , liquid , plaintful , reiterant . " You mean , you know where she is ? " Snopes said nothing . " And that for a price you 'll tell ? " Snopcs said nothing . Horace shut his hands and put them in his pockets , shut against his flanks . " What makes you think that information will interest me ? " " That 's for you to judge . I ai nt conducting no murder case . I was n't down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do nt , I 'll dicker with the other party . I just give you the chance . " Horace turned toward the steps . He moved gingerly , like an old man . " Let 's sit down , " he said . Snopes followedand sat on the step . They sat in the moonlight . " You know where she is ? " " I seen her . " Again he drew his hand across the back of his neck . " Yes , sir . If she ai nt  --  has n't been there , you can git your money back . I taint say no fairer , can IF " And what 's your price ? " Horace said . Snopes puffed the cigar to a careful coal . " Go on , " Horace said . " I 'm not going to haggle . " Snopes told him . " All right , " Horace said . " I 'll pay it . " He drew his knees up and set his elbows on them and laid his hands to his face . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any chance ? " " My folks is . I 'm putty liberal , myself . I ai nt hideboundin no sense , as you 'll find when you know me bet-ter . " " All right , " Horace said from behind his hands . " Where is she ? " " I 'll trust you , " Snopes said . " She 's in a Memphis ' ho '  --  house . "  |p200AS  HORACE ENTERED Miss Reba 's gate and approached the lattice door , someone called his name from behind him . It was evening ; the windows in the weathered , sealingwall were close pale squares . IIe paused and looked back . Around an adjacent corner Snopes 's head peered , turkey-like . He stepped into view . He looked up at the house , then both ways along the street . He came along the fence and entered the gate with a wary air . " Well , judge , " he said . " Boys will be boys , wont they ? " He did n't offer to shake hands . Instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , glancing over his shoulder at the street . " Like I say , it never done no man no harm to git out now and then and  --  " " What is it now ? " Horace said . " What do you want with me ? " " Now , now , judge . I ai nt going to tell this at home . Git that idea clean out of your mind . If us boys startedp201telling what we know , taint none of us git off a train at Jefferson again , hey ? " " You know as well as I do what I 'm doing here . What do you want with me ? " " Sure ; sure , " Snopes said . " I know how a feller feels , married and all and not being sho where his wife is at . " Between jerky glances over his shoulder he winked at Horace . " Make your mind easy . It 's the same with me as if the grave knowed it . Only I hate to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Judge , " Snopes said in a penetrant undertone . Horace turned . " Do nt stay . " " Do nt stay ? " " See her and then leave . It 's a sucker place . Place for farm-boys . Higher'n Monte Carlo . I 'll wait out hyer and I 'll show you a place where  --  ' Horace went on and entered the lattice . Two hours later , as he sat talking to Miss Reba in her room while beyond the door feet and now and then voices came and went in the hall and on the stair , Minnie entered with a torn scrap of paper and brought it to Horace . " What 's that ? " Miss Reba said . " That big pie-face-ted man left it fer him , " Minnie said . " He say fer you to come on down there . " " Did you let him in ? " Miss Reba said . " Nome . He never tried to git in . " " I guess not , " Miss Reba said . She grunted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace . " Yes . I cant seem to help myself , " Horace said . He opened the paper . Torn from a handbill , it bore an addressin pencil in a neat , flowing hand.  | " He turned up here about two weeks ago , " Miss Reba said . " Come in looking for two boys and sat around the dining-room blowing his head off and feeling the girls ' behinds , but if he ever spent a cent I do nt know it . Did he ever give you an order , Minnie ? " " Nome , " Minnie said . " And couple of nights later he was here again . Did n't spend nuttin , did n't do nuttin but talk , and I says to him Look here , mister , folks what uses this waiting-room has got to get on the train now and then . ' So next time he brought a half-pint of whiskey with him . I do nt mind that , from a good customer . But when a fellow like him comes here three times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering four Coca-Colas .. . Just a cheap , vulgar man , honey . So I told Minnie not to let him in any more , and here one afternoon I ai nt no more than laid down for a nap when  --  I never did find out what he done to Minnie to get in . I know he never give her nuttin . How did he do it , Minnie ? He must a showed you something you never seen before . Did n't he ? " Minnie tossed her head . " He ai nt got nothing I wantin to see . I done seed too many now fer my own good . " Minnie 's husband had quit her . He did n't approve of Minnie 's business . He was a cook in a restaurant and he took all the clothes and jewelry the white ladies had given Minnie and went off with a waitress in the restaurant . " He kept on asking and hinting around about that girl , " Miss Reba said , " and me telling him to go ask Popeye if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to get out and stay out , see ; so this day it 's about two in the afternoon and I 'm asleep and Minnie lets him in and he asks her who 's here and she tells him ai nt nobody , and he goes on up stairs . And Minnie says about that time Popeye comes in . She says she do nt know what to do . She 's scared not to let him in , and she says she knows if she does and he spatters that big bastard all over the upstairs floor , she knows I 'll fire her and her husbandjust quit her and all . " So Popeye goes on upstairs on them cat feet of his and comes on your friend on his knees , peeping through the keyhole . Minnie says Popeye stood behind him for about a minute , with his hat cocked over one eye . She says he took out a cigarette and struck a match on his thumbnail without no noise and lit it and then she says he reached over and held the match to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she stood there halfway up the stairs and watched them : that fellow kneeling there with his face like a pie took out of the oven too soon and Popeye squirting smoke through his nose and kind of jerking his head at him . Then she come on down and in about ten seconds here he comes down the stairs with both hands on top of his head , going wump-wumpwumpinside like one of these here big dray-horses , and he pawed at the door for about a minute , moaning to himself like the wind in a chimney Minnie says , until she opened the door and let him out . And that 's the last time he 's even rung this bell until tonight . .. . Let me see that . " Horace gave her the paper . " That 's a nigger whorehouse , " she said . " The lous  --  Minnie , tell him his friend ai nt here . Tell him I do nt know where he went . "  |p204Minnie  went out . Miss Reba said : " I 've had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw the line somewhere . I had lawyers , too . I had the biggest lawyer in Memphis back there in my diningroom , treating my girls . A millionaire . He weighed two hundred and eighty pounds and he had his own special bed made and sent down here . It 's upstairs right this minute . But all in the way of my business , not theirs . I ai nt going to have none of my girls pestered by lawyers without good reason . " " And you do nt consider this good reason ? That a man is being tried for his life for something he did n't do ? You may be guilty right now of harboring a fugitive from justice . " " Then let them come take him . I got nuttin to do with it . I had too many police in this house to be scared of them . " She raised the tankard and drank and drew the back of her hand across her mouth . " I ai nt going to have nuttin to do with nuttin I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . When he starts killing folks in my house , then I 'll take a band . " " Have you any children ? " She looked at him . " I do nt mean to pry into your affairs , " he said . " I was just thinking about that woman . She 'll be on the streets again , and God only knows what will become of that baby . " " Yes , " Miss Reba said . " I 'm supporting four , in a Arkansaw home now . Not mine , though . " She lifted the tankard and looked into it , oscillating it gently . She set it down again . " It better not been born at all , " she said . " None of them had . " She rose and came toward him , moving heavily , and stood above him with her harshp205'breath . She put her hand on his head and tilted his face up . " You ai nt lying to me , are you ? " she said , her eyes piercing and intent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She released him . " Wait here a minute . I 'll see . " She went out . He heard her speak to Minnie in the hall , then he heard her toil up the stairs . He sat quietly as she had left him . The room contained a wooden bed , a painted screen , three overstuffedchairs , a wall safe . The dressing-table was littered with toilet articles tied in pink satin bows . The mantel supported a wax lily beneath a glass bell ; above it , draped in black , the photograph of a meek-looking man with an enormous moustache . On the walls hung a few lithographs of spurious Greek scenes , and one picture done in tatting . Horace rose and went to the door . Minnie sat in a chair in the dim hall . " Minnie , " he said , " I 've got to have a drink . A big one . " He had just finished it when Minnie entered again . " She say fer you to come on up , " she said . He mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way up the hall and opened a door into a dark room . " You 'll have to talk to her in the dark , " she said . " She wont have no light . " Light from the hall fell through the door and across the bed . " This ai nt hers , " Miss Reba said . " Would n't even see you in her room at all . I reckon you better humor her until you find out what you want . " They entered . The light fell across the bed , upon a motionless curving ridge of bedclothing , the general tone of the bed unbroken . She 'll smother , Horace thought . " Honey , " Miss Reba said . The ridge did not move . " Here he is , honey . Long as you 're all coveredp2o6 UP , let 's have some light . Then we can close the door . " She turned the light on . " She 'll smother , " Horace said . " She 'll come out in a minute , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want . I better stay . But do nt mind me . I could n't a stayed in my business without learning to be deaf and dumb a long time before this . And if I 'd ever a had any curiosity , I 'd have worn it out long ago in this house . Here 's a chair . " She turned , but Horace anticipated her and drew up two chairs . He sat down beside the bed and , talking at the top of the unstirring ridge , he told her what he wanted . " I just want to know what really happened . You wont commit yourself . I know that you did n't do it . I 'll promisebefore you tell me a thing that you wont have to testify in Court unless they are going to hang him without it . I know how you feel . I would n't bother you if the man 's life were not at stake . " The ridge did not move . " They 're going to hang him for something he never done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuttin , nobody . And you with diamonds , and her with that poor little kid . You seen it , did n't you ? " The ridge did not move . " I know how you feel , " Horace said . " You can use a different name , wear clothes nobody will recognise you in , glasses . " " They ai nt going to catch Popeye , honey , " Miss Reba said . " Smart as he is . You do nt know his name , noway , and if you have to go and tell them in the court , I 'll send him word after you leave and he 'll go somewheres andp207send for you . You and him do nt want to stay here in Memphis . The lawyer 'll take care of you and you wont have to tell nuttin you  --  " The ridge moved . Temple ( lung the covers back and sat up . Her head was tousled , her face puffed , two spots of rouge on her cheekbones and her mouth painted into a savage cupid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black antagonism , then she looked away . " I want a drink , " she said , pulling up the shoulder of her gown . " Lie down , " Miss Reba said . " You 'll catch cold . " " I want another drink , " Temple said . " Lie down and cover up your nekkidness , anyway , " Miss Reba said , rising . " You already had three since supper . , Temple dragged the gown up again . She looked at Horace . " You give me a drink , then . " " Come on , honey , " Miss Reba said , trying to push her down . " Lie down and get covered up and tell him about that business . I 'll get you a drink in a minute . " " Let me alone , " Temple said , writhing free . Miss Reba drew the covers about her shoulders . " Give me a cigarette , then . Have you got one ? " she asked Horace . " I 'll get you one in a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants you to ? " " What ? " Temple said . She looked at Horace with her black , belligerent stare . " You need n't tell me where your  --  he  --  " Horace said . " Do nt think I 'm afraid to tell , " Temple said . " I 'll tell it anywhere . Do nt think I 'm afraid . I want a drink . "  | " You tell him , and I 'll get you one , " Miss Reba said . Sitting up in the bed , the covers about her shoulders , Temple told him of the night she bad spent in the ruined house , from the time she entered the room and tried to wedge the door with the chair , until the woman came to the bed and led her out . That was the only part of the whole experience which appeared to have left any impression on her at all : the night which she had spent in comparative inviolation . Now and then Horace would attempt to get her on ahead to the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself sitting on the bed , listening to the men on the porch , or lying in the dark while they entered the room and came to the bed and stood there above her . " Yes ; that , " she would say . " It just happened . I do nt know . I had been scared so long that I guess I had just gotten used to being . So I just sat there in those cottonseedsand watched him . I thought it was the rat at first . There were two of them there . One was in one corner looking at me and the other was in the other corner . I dent know what they lived on , because there was n't anythingthere but corn-cobs and cottonseeds . Maybe they went to the house to eat . But there was n't any in the house . I never did hear one in the house . I thought it might have been a rat when I first heard them , but you can feel people in a dark room : did you know that ? Yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like you can i n a car when they begin to look for a good place to stop  --  you know : park for a while . " She went on like that , in one of those bright , chatty monologues which woman can carry on when they realise that they have the centerp209of the stage ; suddenly Horace realised that she was recountingthe experience with actual pride , a sort of naive and impersonal vanity , as though she were making it up , looking from him to Miss Reba with quick , darting glances like a dog driving two cattle along a lane . " And so whenever I breathed I 'd hear those shucks . I do nt see how anybody ever sleeps on a bed like that . But maybe you get used to it . Or maybe they 're tired at eight . Because when I breathed I could hear them , even when I was just sitting on the bed . I did n't see how it could be just breathing , so I 'd sit as still as I could , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes down . You think it goes up , but it does n't . It goes down you , and I 'd hear them getting drunk on the porch . I got to thinking I could see where their heads were leaning back against the wall and I 'd say Now this one 's drinking out of the jug . Now that one 's drinking . Like the mashed-in place on the pillow after you got up , you know . " That was when I got to thinking a funny thing . You know how you do when you 're scared . I was looking at my legs and I 'd try to make like I was a boy . I was thinking about if I just was a boy and then I tried to make myself into one by thinking . You know how you do things like that . Like when you know one problem in class and when they came to that you look at him and think right hard , Call on me . Call on me . Call on me . I 'd think about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to . I actually did . I was that scared , and I 'd wonder if I could tell when it happened . I mean , before I looked , and I 'd think I had and how I 'd go out and show them  --  you know . I 'd strike a match and sayp210Look . See ? Let me alone , now . And then I could go back to bed . I 'd think how I could go to bed and go to sleep then , because I was sleepy . I was so sleepy I simply could n't hardly hold my eyes open . " So I 'd hold my eyes tight shut and say Now I am . I am now . I 'd look at my legs and I 'd think about how much I had done for them . I 'd think about how many dances I had taken them to  --  crazy , like that . Because I thought how much I 'd done for them , and now they 'd gotten me into this . So I 'd think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray and then I 'd sit right still and wait . Then I 'd think maybe I could n't tell it and I 'd get ready to look . Then I 'd think maybe it was too soon to look ; that if I looked too soon I 'd spoil it and then it would n't , sure enough . So I 'd count . I said to count fifty at first , then I thought it was still too soon , and I 'd say to count fifty more . Then I 'd think if I did n't look at the right time , it would be too late . " Then I thought about fastening myself up some way . There was a girl went abroad one summer that told me about a kind of iron belt in a museum a king or somethingused to lock the queen up in when he had to go away , and I thought if I just had that . That was why I got the raincoat and put it on . The canteen was hanging by it and I got it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horace said . " Why did you do that ? " " I do nt know why I took it . I was just scared to leave it there , I guess . But I was thinking if I just had that French thing . I was thinking maybe it would have long sharp spikes on it and he would n't know it until too late and I 'd jab it into him . I 'd jab it all the way throughp211him and I 'd think about the blood running on me and how I 'd say I guess that 'll teach you ! I guess you 'll let me alone now ! I 'd say . I did n't know it was going to be just the other way ... I want a drink . " " I 'll get you one in a minute , " Miss Reba said . " Go on and tell him . " " Oh , yes ; this was something else funny I did . " She told about lying in the darkness with Gowan snoring beside her , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching . She could hear the blood in her veins , and the little muscles at the corners of her eyes cracking faintly wider and wider , and she could feel her nostrils going alternately cool and warm . Then he was standing over and she was saying Come on . Touch me . Touch me ! You 're a coward if you do nt . Coward ! Coward ! " I wanted to go to sleep , you see . And he just kept on standing there . I thought if he 'd just go on and get it over with , I could go to sleep . So I 'd say You 're a coward if you do nt ! You 're a coward if you do nt ! and I could feel my mouth getting fixed to scream , and that little hot ball inside you that screams . Then it touched me , that nasty little cold hand , fiddling around inside the coat where I was naked . It was like alive ice and my skin started jumping away from it like those little flying fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin knew which way it was going to go before it started moving , and my skin would keep on jerking just ahead of it like there would n't be anything there when the hand got there . " Then it got down to where my insides begin , and I had n't eaten since yesterday at dinner and my insides started bubbling and going on and the shucks began to make so much noise it was like laughing . I 'd think they were laughing at me because all the time his hand was going inside the top of my knickers and I had n't changed into a boy yet . " That was the funny thing , because I was n't breathing then . I had n't breathed in a long time . So I thought I was dead . Then I did a funny thing . I could see myself in the coffin . I looked sweet  --  you know : all in white . I had on a veil like a bride , and I was crying because I was dead or looked sweet or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin . I was crying because they had put shucks in the coffin where I was dead , but all the time I could feel my nose going cold and hot and cold and hot , and I could see all the people sitting around the coffin , saying Do nt she look sweet . Do nt she look sweet . " But I kept on saying Coward ! Coward ! Touch me , coward ! I got mad , because he was so long doing it . I 'd talk to him . I 'd say Do you think I 'm going to lie here all night , just waiting on you ? I 'd say . Let me tell you what I 'll do , I 'd say . And I 'd lie there with the shucks laughing at me and me jerking away in front of his hand and I 'd think what I 'd say to him , I 'd talk to him like the teacher does in school , and then I was a teacher in school and it was a little black thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher . Because I 'd say How old am I ? and I'ci say I 'm forty-five years old . I had iron-gray hair and spectaclesand I was all big up here like women get . I had on a gray tailored suit , and I never could wear gray . And I was telling it what I 'd do , and it kind of drawing up and drawing up like it could already see the switch.  | " Then I said That wont do . I ought to be a man . So I was an old man , with a long white beard , and then the little black man got littler and littler and I was sayingNow . You see now . I 'm a man now . Then I thought about being a man , and as soon as I thought it , it happened . It made a kind of plopping sound , like blowing a little rubber tube wrong-side outward . It felt cold , like the inside of your mouth when you hold it open . I could feel it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to be . I could feel the jerkinggoing on inside my knickers ahead of his hand and me lying there trying not to laugh about how surprised and mad he was going to be in about a minute . Then all of a sudden I went to sleep . I could n't even stay awake until his hand got there . I just went to sleep . I could n't even feel myself jerking in front of his hand , but I could hear the shucks . I did n't wake up until that woman came and took me down to the crib . " As he was leaving the house Miss Reba said : " I wish you 'd get her down there and not let her come back . I 'd find her folks myself , if I knowed how to go about it . But you know how ... She 'll be dead , or in the asylum in a year , way him and her go on up there in that room . There 's something funny about it that I ai nt found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't born for this kind of life . You have to be born for this like you have to be born a butcher or a barber , I guess . Would n't anybody be either of them just for money or fun . " Better for her if she were dead tonight , Horace thought , walking on . For me , too . He thought of her , Popeye , the woman , the child , Goodwin , all put into ap214single chamber , bare , lethal , immediate and profound : a single blotting instant between the indignation and the surprise . And I too ; thinking how that were the only solution . Removed , cauterised out of the old and tragic flank of the world . And I , too , now that we 're all isolated ; thinking of a gentle dark wind blowing in the long corridors of sleep ; of lying beneath a low cozy roof under the long sound of the rain : the evil , the injustice , the tears . In an alley-mouth two figures stood , face to face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprintableepithet after epithet in a caressing whisper , the woman motionless before him as though in a musing swoon of voluptuous ecstasy . Perhaps it is upon the instantthat we realise , admit , that there is a logical pattern to evil , that we die , he thought , thinking of the expressionhe had once seen in the eyes of a dead child , and of other dead : the cooling indignation , the shocked despair fading , leaving two empty globes in which the motionlessworld lurked profoundly in miniature . He did not even return to his hotel . He went to the station . He could get a train at midnight . He had a cup of coffee and wished immediately that he had not , for it lay in a hot ball on his stomach . Three hours later , when he got off at Jefferson , it was still there , unassimilated . He walked to town and crossed the deserted square . He thought of the other morning when he had crossed it . It was as though there had not been any elapsed time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same vulture-like shadows in the doorways ; it might be the same morning and he had merely crossed the square , about-faced and was returning ; all between a dreamp215filled with all the nightmare shapes it had taken him forty-three years to invent , concentrated in a hot , hard lump in his stomach . Suddenly he was walking fast , the coffee jolting like a hot , heavy rock inside him . He walked quietly up the drive , beginning to smell the honeysuckle from the fence . The house was dark , still , as though it were marooned in space by the ebb of all time . The insects had fallen to a low monotonous pitch , everywhere , nowhere , spent , as though the sound were the chemical agony of a world left stark and dying above the tide-edge of the fluid in which it lived and breathed . The moon stood overhead , but without light ; the earth lay beneath , without darkness . He opened the door and felt his way into the room and to the light . The voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followedhim into the house ; he knew suddenly that it was the friction of the earth on its axis , approaching that moment when it must decide to turn on or to remain forever still : a motionless ball in cooling space , across which a thick smell of honeysuckle writhed like cold smoke . He found the light and turned it on . The photograph sat on the dresser . He took it up , holding it in his hands . Enclosed by the narrow imprint of the missing frame Little Belle 's face dreamed with that quality of sweet chiaroscuro . Communicated to the cardboard by some quality of the light or perhaps by some infinitesimal movement of his hands , his own breathing , the face appeared to breathe in his palms in a shallow bath of highlight , beneath the slow , smokelike tongues of invisible honeysuckle . Almost palpable enough to be seen , the scent filled the room and the small face seemed to swoonp216in a voluptuous languor , blurring still more , fading , leay. ing upon his eye a soft and fading aftermath of invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he knew what that sensation in his stomach meant . He put the photograph down hurriedly and went to the bathroom . He opened the door running and fumbledat the light . But he had not time to find it and he gave over and plunged forward and struck the lavatory and leaned upon his braced arms while the shucks set up a terrific uproar beneath her thighs . Lying with her head lifted slightly , her chin depressed like a figure lifted down from a crucifix , she watched something black and furious go roaring out of her pale body . She was bound naked on her back on a flat car moving at speed through a black tunnel , the blackness streaming in rigid threads overhead , a roar of iron wheels in her ears . The car shot bodily from the tunnel in a long upward slant , the darknessoverhead now shredded with parallel attenuations of living fire , toward a crescendo like a held breath , an interval in which she would swing faintly and lazily in nothingness filled with pale , myriad points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , furious uproar of the shucks.  |p217THE  FIRST TIME Temple went to the head of the stairs Minnie 's eyeballs rolled out of the dusky light beside Miss Reba 's door . Leaning once more within her bolted door Temple heard Miss Reba toil up the stairs and knock . Temple leaned silently against the door while Miss Reba panted and wheezed beyond it with a mixture of blandishment and threat . She made no sound . After a while Miss Reba went back down the stairs . Temple turned from the door and stood in the center of the room , beating her hands silently together , her eyes black in her livid face . She wore a street dress , a hat . She removed the hat and hurled it into a corner and went and flung herself face down upon the bed . The bed had not been made . The table beside it was littered with cigarette stubs , the adjacent floor strewn with ashes . The pillow slip on that side was spotted with brown holes . Often in the night she would wake to smell tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be . It was midmorning . A thin bar of sunlight fell beneath the drawn shade of the south window , lying upon the sill and then upon the floor in a narrow band . The house was utterly quiet , with that quality as of spent breathing which it had in midmorning . Now and then a car passed in the street beneath . Temple turned over on the bed . When she did so she saw one of Popeye 's innumerable black suits lying across a chair . She lay looking at it for a while , then she rose and snatched the garments up and hurled them into the corner where the hat was . In another corner was a closet improvised by a print curtain . It contained dresses of all sorts and all new . She ripped them down in furious wads and flung them after the suit , and a row of hats from a shelf . Another of Popeye 's suits hung there also . She flung it down . Behind it , hanging from a nail , was an automaticpistol in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and removed the pistol and stood with it in her hand . After a moment she went to the bed and hid it beneath the pillow . The dressing-table was cluttered with toilet-thingsbrushesand mirrors , also new ; with flasks and jars of delicate and bizarre shapes , bearing French labels . One by one she gathered them up and hurled them into the corner in thuds and splintering crashes . Among them lay a platinum bag : a delicate webbing of metal upon the smug orange gleam of banknotes . This followed the other things into the corner and she returned to the bedp219and lay again on her face in a slow thickening of expensivescent . At noon Minnie tapped at the door . " Here yo dinner . " Temple did n't move . " I ghy leave it here by the door . You can git it when you wants it . " Her feet went away . Temple did not move . Slowly the bar of sunlight shifted across the floor ; the western side of the window-frame was now in shadow . Temple sat up , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deft habitude at her hair . She rose quietly and went to the door and listened again . Then she opened it . The tray sat on the floor . She stepped over it and went to the stairs and peered over the rail . After a while she made Minnie out , sitting in a chair in the hall . " Minnie , " she said . Minnie 's head jerked up ; again her eyes rolled whitely . " Bring me a drink , " Temple said . She returned to her room . She waited fifteen minutes . She banged the door and was tramping furiously down the stairs when Minnie appeared in the hall . " Yessum , " Minnie said , " Miss Reba say  --  We ai nt got no  --  " Miss Reba 's door opened . Without looking up at Temple she spoke to Minnie . Minnie lifted her voice again . " Yessum ; all right . I bring it up in just a minute . " " You 'd better , " Temple said . She returned and stood just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Temple opened the door , holding it just ajar . " Ai nt you going to eat no dinner ? " Minnie said , thrustingat the door with her knee . Temple held it to . " Where is it ? " she said.  | " I ai nt straightened your room up this mawnin , " Minniesaid . " Give it here , " Temple said , reaching her hand through the crack . She took the glass from the tray . " You better make that un last , " Minnie said . " Miss Reba say you ai nt ghy git no more .. . . What you want to treat him this-a-way , fer ? Way he spend his money on you , you ought to be ashamed . He a right pretty little man , even if he ai nt no John Gilbert , and way he spendin his money  --  " Temple shut the door and shot the bolt . She drank the gin and drew a chair up to the bed and lit a cigarette and sat down with her feet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and lifted the shade a little so she could see the street beneath . She lit another cigarette . At five oclock she saw Miss Reba emerge , in the black silk and flowered hat , and go down the street . She sprang up and dug the hat from the mass of clothes in the corner and put it on . At the door she turned and went back to the corner and exhumed the platinum purse and descended the stairs . Minnie was in the hall . " I 'll give you ten dollars , " Temple said . " I wont be gone ten minutes . " " I taint do it , Miss Temple . Hit be worth my job if Miss Reba find it out , and my th'oat too , if Mist Popeye do . " " I swear I 'll be back in ten minutes . I swear I will . Twenty dollars . " She put the bill in Minnie 's hand . " You better come back , " Minnie said , opening the door . " If you ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be , neither . "  |p221Tem|ple  opened the lattice and peered out . The street was empty save for a taxi at the curb across the way , and a man in a cap standing in a door beyond it . She went down the street , walking swiftly . At the corner a cab overtook her , slowing , the driver looking at her interrogatively . She turned into the drug store at the corner and went back to the telephone booth . Then she returned to the house . As she turned the corner she met the man in the cap who had been leaning in the door . She entered the lattice . Minnie opened the door . " Thank goodness , " Minnie said . " When that cab over there started up , I got ready to pack up too . If you ai nt ghy say nothing about it , I git you a drink . " When Minnie fetched the gin Temple started to drink it . Her hand was trembling and there was a sort of elation in her face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass in her hand . I 'll need it later , she said . I 'll need more than that . She covered the glass with a saucer and hid it carefully . Then she dug into the mass of garments in the corner and found a dancing-frock and shook it out and hung it back in the closet . She looked at the other things a moment , but she returned to the bed and lay down again . At once she rose and drew the chair up and sat down , her feet on the unmade bed . While daylight died slowly in the room she sat smoking cigaretteafter cigarette , listening to every sound on the stairs . At half-past six Minnie brought her supper up . On the tray was another glass of gin . " Miss Reba sont this un , " she said . " She say , how you feelin ? " " Tell her , all right , " Temple said . " I 'm going to have a bath and then go to bed , tell her . "  | When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbler and gloated over it , the glass shaking in her hands . She set it carefully away and covered it and ate her supper from the bed . When she finished she lit a cigarette . Her movements were jerky ; she smoked swiftly , moving about the room . She stood for a moment at the window , the shade lifted aside , then she dropped it and turned into the room again , spying herself in the mirror . She turned before it , studying herself , puffing at the cigarette . She snapped it behind her , toward the fireplace , and went to the mirror and combed her hair . She ripped the curtain aside and took the dress down and laid it on the bed and returned and drew out a drawer in the dresser and took a garment out . She paused with the garment in her hand , then she replaced it and closed the drawer and caught up the frock swiftly and hung it back in the closet . A moment later she found herself walking up and down the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having lit it . She flung it away and went to the table and looked at her watch and propped it against the pack of cigarettes so she could seeit from the bed , and lay down . When she did so she felt the pistol through the pillow . She slipped it out and looked at it , then she slid it under her flank and lay motionless , her legs straight , her hands behind her head , her eyes focussing into black pinheads at every sound on the stairs . At nine she rose . She picked up the pistol again ; after a moment she thrust it beneath the mattress andp223undressed and in a spurious Chinese robe splotched with gold dragons and jade and scarlet flowers she left the room . When she returned her hair curled damply about her face . She went to the washstand and took up the tumbler , holding it in her hands , but she set it down again . She dressed , retrieving the bottles and jars from the corner . Her motions before the glass were furious yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , but again she paused and went to the corner and got her coat and put it on and put the platinum bag in the pocket and leaned once more to the mirror . Then she went and took up the glass and gulped the gin and left the room , walking swiftly . A single light burned in the hall . It was empty . She could hear voices in Miss Reba 's room , but the lower hall was deserted . She descended swiftly and silently and gained the door . She believed that it would be at the door that they would stop her and she thought of the pistol with acute regret , almost pausing , knowing that she would use it without any compunction whatever , with a kind of pleasure . She sprang to the door and pawed at the bolt , her head turned over her shoulder . It opened . She sprang out and out the lattice door and ran down the walk and out the gate . As she did so a car , moving slowly along the curb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without any apparent movementfrom him the door swung open . He made no movement , spoke no word . He just sat there , the straw hat slanted a little aside.  | " I wont ! " Temple said . " I wont ! " He made no movement , no sound . She came to the car . " I wont , I tell you ! ' Then she cried wildly : " You 're scared of him ! You 're scared to ! " " I 'm giving him his chance , " he said . " Will you go back in that house , or will you get in this car ? " " You 're scared to ! " " I 'm giving him his chance , " he said , in his cold soft voice . " Come on . Make up your mind . " She leaned forward , putting her hand on his arm . " Popeye , " she said ; " daddy . " His arm felt frail , no larger than a child 's , dead and hard and light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " But do it . Come on . She leaned toward him , her hand on his arm . Then she got into the car . " You wont do it . You 're afraid to . He 's a better man than you are . " He reached across and shut the door . " Where ? " he said . " Grotto ? " " He 's a better man than you are ! " Temple said shrilly . " You 're not even a man ! He knows it . Who does know it if he do nt ? " The car was in motion . She began to shriek at him . " You , a man , a bold bad man , when you cant even  --  When you had to bring a real man in to  --  And you hanging over the bed , moaning and slobbering like a  --  You could n't fool me but once , could you ? No wonder I bled and bluh  --  " his band came over her mouth , hard , his nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the car at reckless speed . When theyp225passed beneath lights she could see him watching her as she struggled , tugging at his hand , whipping her head this way and that . She ceased struggling , but she continued to twist her bead from side to side , tugging at his hand . One finger , ringed with a thick ring , held her lips apart , his fingertipsdigging into her cheek . With the other hand he whipped the car in and out of traffic , bearing down upon other cars until they slewed aside with brakes squealing , shooting recklessly across intersections . Once a policemanshouted at them , but he did not even look around . Temple began to whimper , moaning behind his hand , drooling upon his fingers . The ring was like a dentist 's instrument ; she could not close her lips to regurgitate . When he removed it she could feel the imprint of his fingers cold on her jaw . She lifted her hand to it . " You hurt my mouth , " she whimpered . They were approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hat slanted above his delicate hooked profile . She nursed her jaw . The houses gave way to broad , dark subdivisions out of which realtors ' signs loomed abrupt and ghostly , with a quality of forlorn assurance . Between them low , far lights hung in the cool empty darkness blowing with fireflies . She began to cry quietly , feeling the cooling double drink of gin inside her . " You hurt my mouth , " she said in a voice small and faint with self-pity . She nursed her jaw with experimentalfingers , pressing harder and harder until she found a twinge . " You 'll be sorry for this , " she said in a muffed voice . " 7hen I tell Red . Do nt you wish you were Red ?  |p226Dont  you ? Do nt you wish you could do what he can do ? Do nt you wish he was the one watching us instead of you ? " They turned into the Grotto , passing along a closely curtained wall from which a sultry burst of music came . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on up the steps . " I gave you your chance , " she said . " You brought me here . I did n't ask you to come . " She went to the washroom . In the mirror she examined her face . " Shucks , " she said , " it did n't leave a mark , even " ; drawing the flesh this way and that . " Little runt , " she said , peering at her reflection . She added a phrase , glibly obscene , with a detached parrotlike effect . She painted her mouth again . Another woman entered . They examined one another 's clothes with brief , covert , cold , embracing glances . Popeye was standing at the door to the dancehall , a cigarette in his fingers . " I gave you your chance , " Temple said . " You did n't have to come . " " I do nt take chances , " he said . " You took one , " Temple said . " Are you sorry ? Huh ? " " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was in the act of stepping over the sill when she turned and looked at him , their eyes almost on a level ; then her hand flicked toward his armpit . He caught her wrist ; the other hand flicked toward him . He caught that one too in his soft , cold hand . They looked eye to eye , her mouth open and the rouge spots darkening slowly on her face . " I gave you your chance back there in town , " he said . " You took it . "  |p227Behind  her the music beat , sultry , evocative ; filled with movement of feet , the voluptuous hysteria of muscleswarming the scent of flesh , of the blood . " Oh , God ; oh , God , " she said , her lips scarce moving . " I 'll go . I 'll go back . " " You took it , " he said . " Go on . " In his grasp her hands made tentative plucking motionsat his coat just out of reach of her finger-tips . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted . " You just dare ! " she cried . " You just  --  " His hand closed upon the back of her neck , his fingers like steel , yet cold and light as aluminum . She could hear the vertebrae grating faintly together , and his voice , cold and still . " Will you ? " She nodded her head . Then they were dancing . She could still feel his hand at her neck . Across his shoulder she looked swiftly about the room , her gaze flicking from face to face among the dancers . Beyond a low arch , in another room , a group stood about the crap-table . She leaned this way and that , trying to see the faces of the group . Then she saw the four men . They were sitting at a table near the door . One of them was chewing gum ; the whole lower part of his face seemed to be cropped with teeth of an unbelievable whiteness and size . When she saw them she swung Popeye around with his back to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more her harried gaze flew from face to face in the crowd . When she looked again two of the men had risen . They approached . She dragged Popeye into their path ,  |p228still  keeping his back turned to them . The men paused and essayed to go around her ; again she backed Popeye into their path . She was trying to say something to him , but her mouth felt cold . It was like trying to pick up a pin with the fingers numb . Suddenly she felt herself lifted bodily aside , Popeye 's small arms light and rigid as aluminum . She stumbled back against the wall and watched the two men leave the room . " I 'll go back , " she said . " I 'll go back . " She began to laugh shrilly . " Shut it , " Popeye said . " Are you going to shut it ? " " Get me a drink , " she said . She felt his hand ; her legs felt cold too , as if they were not hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was still chewing , his elbows on the table . The fourth man sat on his spine , smoking , his coat buttoned across his chest . She watched hands : a brown one in a white sleeve , a soiled white one beneath a dirty cuff , setting bottles on the table . She had a glass in her hand . She drank , gulping ; with the glass in her hand she saw Red standing in the door , in a gray suit and a spotted bow tie . He looked like a college boy , and he looked about the room until he saw her . He looked at the back of Popeye 's head , then at her as she sat with the glass in her hand . The two men at the other table had not moved . She could see the faint , steady movement of the one 's ears as he chewed . The music started . She held Popeye 's back toward Red . He was still watching her , almost a head taller than anybody else . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to dance , dance . " She had another drink . They danced again . Red hadp229disappeared . When the music ceased she had another drink . It did no good . It merely lay hot and hard insideher . " Come on , " she said , " do nt quit . " But he would n't get up , and she stood over him , her muscles flinching and jerking with exhaustion and terror . She began to jeer at him . " Call yourself a man , a bold , bad man , and let a girl dance you off your feet . " Then her face drained , became small and haggard and sincere ; she spoke like a child , with sober despair . " Popeye . " He sat with his hands on the table , finicking with a cigarette , the second glass with its melting ice before him . She put her hand on his shoulder . " Daddy , " she said . Moving to shield them from the room , her hand stole toward his armpit , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light , dead vise of his arm and side . " Give it to me , " she whispered . " Daddy . Daddy . " She leaned her thigh against his shoulder , caressing his arm with her flank . " Give it to me , daddy , " she whispered . Suddenlyher hand began to steal down his body in a swift , covert movement ; then it snapped away in a movement of revulsion . " I forgot , " she whispered ; " I did n't mean .. . I did n't .. One of the men at the other table hissed once through his teeth . " Sit down , " Popeye said . She sat down . She filled her glass , watching her hands perform the action . Then she was watching the corner of the gray coat . He 's got a broken button , she thought stupidly . Popeye had not moved . " Dance this ? " Red said . His head was bent but he was not looking at her . He was turned a little , facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move . He shredded delicately the end of the cigarette , pinching the tobacco off . Then he put it into his mouth . " I 'm not dancing , " Temple said through her cold lips . " Not ? " Red said . He said , in a level tone , without moving : " How 's the boy ? " " Fine , " Popeye said . Temple watched him scrape a match , saw the flame distorted through glass . " You 've had enough , " Popeye said . His hand took the glass from her lips . She watched him empty it into the ice bowl . The music started again . She sat looking quietly about the room . A voice began to buzz faintly at her hearing , then Popeye was gripping her wrist , shaking it , and she found that her mouth was open and that she must have been making a noise of some sort with it . " Shut it , now , " he said . " You can have one more . " He poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it at all , " she said . He gave her the glass . She drank . When she set the glass down she realised that she was drunk . She believed that she had been drunk for some time . She thought that perhaps she had passed out and that it had already happened . She could hear herself saying I hope it has . I hope it has . Then she believed it had and she was overcome by a sense of bereavement and of physical desire . She thought , It will never be again , and she sat in a floating swoon of agonised sorrow and erotic longing , thinking of Red 's body , watching her hand holding the empty bottle over the glass . " You 've drunk it all , " Popeye said . " Get up , now . Dance it off . " They danced again . She moved stiffly and languidly , her eyes open but unseeing ; her body follow/ing the music without hearing the tune for a time . Then she became aware that the orchestra was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . If that were so , then it could n't have happened yet . She felt a wild surge of relief . It was not too late : Red was still alive ; she felt long shuddering waves of physical desire going over her , draining the color from her mouth , drawingher eyeballs back into her skull in a shuddering swoon . They were at the crap-table . She could hear herself shouting to the dice . She was rolling them , winning ; the counters were piling up in front of her as Popeye drew them in , coaching her , correcting her in his soft , querulousvoice . He stood beside her , shorter than she . He had the cup himself . She stood beside him cunningly , feeling the desire going over her in wave after wave , involved with the music and with the smell of her own flesh . She became quiet . By infinitesimal inches she moved aside until someone slipped into her place . Then she was walking swiftly and carefully across the floor toward the door , the dancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave . The table where the two men had sat was empty , but she did not even glance at it . She entered the corridor . A waiter met her . " Room , " she said . " Hurry . " The room contained a table and four chairs . The waiter turned on the light and stood in the door . She jerked her hand at him ; he went out . She leaned against the table on her braced arms , watching the door , until Red entered . He came toward her . She did not move . I-Ier eyes be- gan to grow darker and darker , lifting into her skull above a half moon of white , without focus , with the blank rigidity of a statue 's eyes . She began to say Ahah-ah-ahin an expiring voice , her body arching slowly backward as though faced by an exquisite torture . When he touched her she sprang like a bow , hurling herself upon him , her mouth gaped and ugly like that of a dying fish as she writhed her loins against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her hips grinding against him , her mouth gaping in straining protrusion , bloodless , she began to speak . " Let 's hurry . Anywhere . I 've quit him . I told him so . It 's not my fault . Is it my fault ? You do nt need your hat and I do nt either . He came here to kill you but I said I gave him his chance . It was n't my fault . And now it 'll just be us . Without him there watching . Come on . What 're you waiting for ? " She strained her mouth toward him , dragging his head down , making a whimpering moan . He held his face free . " I told him I was . I said if you bring me here . I gave you your chance I said . And now he 's got them there to bump you off . But you 're not afraid . Are you ? " " Did you know that when you telephoned me ? " he said . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he 'd kill you . But he had me followed when I telephoned . I saw him . But you 're not afraid . He 's not even a man , but you are . You 're a man . You 're a man . " She began to grind against him , dragging at his head , murmuring to him in parrotlike underworld epithet , the saliva running pale over her bloodless lips . " Are you afraid ? " " Of that dopey bastard ? " Lifting her bodily he turnedp233so that he faced the door , and slipped his right hand free . She did not seem to be aware that he had moved . " Please . Please . Please . Please . Do nt make me wait . I 'm burning up . " " All right . You go on back . You wait till I give you the sign . Will you go on back ? " " I cant wait . You 've got to . I 'm on fire , I tell you . " She clung to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he holding her clear of his right side ; she in a voluptuous swoon , unaware that they were moving , straining at him as though she were trying to touch him with all of her body-surface at once . He freed himself and thrust her into the passage . " Go on , " he said . " I 'll be there in a minute . " " You wont be long ? I 'm on fire . I 'm dying , I tell you . " " No . Not long . Go on , now . " The music was playing . She moved up the corridor , staggering a little . She thought that she was leaning against the wall , when she found that she was dancing again ; then that she was dancing with two men at once ; then she found that she was not dancing but that she was moving toward the door between the man with the chewing gum and the one with the buttoned coat . She tried to stop , but they had her under the arms ; she opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swirling room . " Yell , " the man with the buttoned coat said . " Just try it once . " Red was at the crap-table . She saw his head turned , the cup in his lifted hand . With it he made her a short , cheery salute . He watched her disappear through the door , between the two men . Then he looked briefly about the room . His face was bold and calm , but there were two white lines at the base of his nostrils and his forehead was damp . He rattled the cup and threw the dice steadily . " Eleven , " the dealer said . " Let it lay , " Red said . " I 'll pass a million times tonight . " They helped Temple into the car . The man in the buttonedcoat took the wheel . Where the drive joined the lane that led to the highroad a long touring car was parked . When they passed it Temple saw , leaning to a cupped match , Popeye 's delicate hooked profile beneath the slanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward like a dying star in miniature , sucked with the profile into darkness by the rush of their passing.  |p235THE  TABLES had been moved to one end of the dance floor . On each one was a black table-cloth . The curtains were still drawn ; a thick , salmon-colored light fell through them . Just beneath the orchestra platform the coffin sat . It was an expensive one : black , with silver fittings , the trestles hidden by a mass of flowers . In wreaths and crosses and other shapes of ceremonial mortality , the mass appeared to break in a symbolical wave over the bier and on upon the platform and the piano , the scent of them thickly oppressive . The proprietor of the place moved about among the tables , speaking to the arrivals as they entered and found seats . The Negro waiters , in black shirts beneath their starched jackets , were already moving in and out with glasses and bottles of ginger ale . They moved with swaggeringand decorous repression ; already the scene was vivid , with a hushed , macabre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was draped in black.  | A black pall lay upon the crap-table , upon which the overflow of floral shapes was beginning to accumulate . People entered steadily , the men in dark suits of decorous restraint , others in the light , bright shades of spring , increasing the atmosphere of macabre paradox . The women  --  the younger ones  --  wore bright colors also , in hats and scarves ; the older ones in sober gray and black and navy blue , and glittering with diamonds : matronly figures resembling housewives on a Sunday afternoon excursion . The room began to hum with shrill , hushed talk . The waiters moved here and there with high , precarious trays , their white jackets and black shirts resembling photographnegatives . The proprietor went from table to table with his bald head , a huge diamond in his black cravat , followed by the bouncer , a thick , muscle-bound , bulletheadedman who appeared to be on the point of burstingout of his dinner-jacket through the rear , like a cocoon . In a private dining-room , on a table draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ice and sliced fruit . Beside it leaned a fat man in a shapeless greenish suit , from the sleeves of which dirty cuffs fell upon hands rimmed with black nails . The soiled collar was wilted about his neck in limp folds , knotted by a greasy black tie with an imitation ruby stud . His face gleamed with moisture and he adjured the throng about the bowl in a harsh voice : " Come on , folks . It 's on Gene . It do nt cost you nothing . Step up and drink . There was n't never a better bov walked than him . " They drank and fell back , replacedp237by others with extended cups . From time to time a waiter entered with ice and fruit and dumped them into the bowl ; from a suit case under the table Gene drew fresh bottles and decanted them into the bowl ; then , proprietorial , adjurant , sweating , he resumed his harsh monologue , mopping his face on his sleeve . " Come on , folks . It 's all on Gene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had a better friend than me . Step up and drink , folks . There 's more where that come from . " From the dance hall came a strain of music . The people entered and found seats . On the platform was the orchestra from a downtown hotel , in dinner coats . The proprietor and a second man were conferring with the leader . " Let them play jazz , " the second man said . " Never nobody liked dancing no better than Red . " " No , no , " the proprietor said . " Time Gene gets them all ginned up on free whiskey , they 'll start dancing . It 'll look bad . " " How about the Blue Danube ? " the leader said . " No , no ; do nt play no blues , I tell you , " the proprietor said . " There 's a dead man in that bier . " " That 's not blues , " the leader said . " What is it ? " the second man said . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second man said . " Like hell . Red was an American . You may not be , but he was . Do nt you know anything American ? Play I Cant Give You Anything but Love . He always liked that . " " And get them all to dancing ? " the proprietor said . He glanced back at the tables , where the women were be- ginning to talk a little shrilly . " You better start off with Nearer , My God , to Thee , " he said , " and sober them up some . I told Gene it was risky about that punch , starting it so soon . My suggestion was to wait until we started back to town . But I might have knowed somebody 'd have to turn it into a carnival . Better start off solemn and keep it up until I give you the sign . " " Red would n't like it solemn , " the second man said . " And you know it . " " Let him go somewheres else , then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accommodation . I ai nt running no funeral parlor . " The orchestra played Nearer , My God , to Thee . The audience grew quiet . A woman in a red dress came in the door unsteadily . " Whoopee , " she said , " so long , Red . He 'll be in hell before I could even reach Little Rock . " " Shhhhhhhh ! " voices said . She fell into a seat . Gene came to the door and stood there until the music stopped . " Come on , folks , " he shouted , jerking his arms in a fat , sweeping gesture , " come and get it . It 's on Gene . I do nt want a dry throat or eye in this place in ten minutes . " Those at the rear moved toward the door . The proprietor sprang to his feet and jerked his hand at the orchestra . The cornetist rose and played In That Haven of Rest in solo , but the crowd at the back of the room continued to dwindle through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were weeping quietly beneathflowered hats . They surged and clamored about the diminishing bowl . From the dance hall came the rich blare of the cor/net . Two soiled young men worked their way toward the table , shouting " Gangway . Gangway " monotonously , carrying suit cases . They opened them and set bottles on the table , while Gene , frankly weeping now , opened them and decanted them into the bowl . " Come up , folks . I could n't a loved him no better if he 'd a been my own son , " he shouted hoarsely , dragging his sleeve across his face . A waiter edged up to the table with a bowl of ice and fruit and went to put them into the punch bowl . " What the hell you doing ? " Gene said , " putting that slop in there ? Get to hell away from here . " " Ra-a-a-a-y-y-y-y ! " they shouted , clashing their cups , drowning all save the pantomime as Gene knocked the bowl of fruit from the waiter 's hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sploshing it into and upon the extended hands and cups . The two youths opened bottles furiously . As though swept there upon a brassy blare of music the proprietor appeared in the door , his face harried , waving his arms . " Come on , folks , " he shouted , " let 's finishthe musical program . It 's costing us money . " " Hell with it , " they shouted . " Costing who money ? " " Who cares ? " " Costing who money ? " " Who begrudges it ? I 'll pay it . By God , I 'll buy him two funerals . " " Folks ! Folks ! " the proprietor shouted . " Do nt you realise there 's a bier in that room ? "  | " Costing who money ? " " Beer ? " Gene said . " Beer ? " he said in a broken voice " Is anybody here trying to insult me by  --  " " He begrudges Red the money . " " Who does ? " " Joe does , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here trying to insult me  --  " " Let 's move the funeral , then . This is not the only pla in town . " " Let 's move Joe . " " Put the son of a bitch in a coffin . Let 's have two funerals . " " Beer ? Beer ? Is somebody  --  " ' " Put the son of a bitch in a coffin . See how he likes it . " Put the son of a bitch in a coffin , " the woman in red shrieked . They rushed toward the door , where the pr . prietor stood waving his hands above his head , his vol. shrieking out of the uproar before he turned and fled . In the main room a male quartet engaged from vaudeville house was singing . They were singing moth : . songs in close harmony ; they sang Sonny Boy . The wee . ing was general among the older women . Waiters we now carrying cups of punch in to them and they sat hold ing the cups in their fat , ringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in red stag gered into the room . " Come on , Joe , " she shouted , " ope s the game . Get that damn stiff out of here and open th : , game . " A man tried to hold her ; she turned upon hiwith a burst of filthy language and went on to the shrouded crap-table and hurled a wreath to the floor . The proprietor rushed toward her , followed by the ' ; P241bouncer . The proprietor grasped the woman as she lifted another floral piece . The man who had tried to hold her intervened , the woman cursing shrilly and striking at both of them impartially with the wreath . The bouncer caught the man 's arm ; he whirled and struck at the bouncer , who knocked him halfway across the room . Three more men entered . The fourth rose from the floor and all four of them rushed at the bouncer . He felled the first and whirled and sprang with unbelievablecelerity , into the main room . The orchestra was playing . It was immediately drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncer whirled again and met the rush of the four men . They mingled ; a second man flew out and skittered along the floor on his back ; the bouncer sprang free . Then he whirled and rushed them and in a whirling plunge they bore down upon the bier and crashed into it . The orchestrahad ceased and were now climbing onto their chairs , with their instruments . The floral offerings flew ; the coffinteetered . " Catch it ! " a voice shouted . They sprang forward , but the coffin crashed heavily to the floor , comingopen . The corpse tumbled slowly and sedately out and came to rest with its face in the center of a wreath . " Play something ! " the proprietor bawled , waving his arms . " Play ! Play ! " When they raised the corpse the wreath came too , attached to him by a hidden end of a wire driven into his cheek . He had worn a cap which , tumbled off , exposed a small blue hole in the center of his forehead . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wax had been jarred out and lost . They could n't find it , but by unfastening the snap in the peak , they could draw cap down to his eyes . As the cortege neared the downtown section more ca joined it . The hearse was followed by six Packard to ing cars with the tops back , driven by liveried chauffe and filled with flowers . They looked exactly alike a . were of the type rented by the hour by the better-class agencies . Next came a nondescript line of taxis , roadste sedans , which increased as the procession moved slow through the restricted district where faces peered fro . beneath lowered shades , toward the main artery that 1 back out of town , toward the cemetery . On the avenue the hearse increased its speed , the pr cession stretching out at swift intervals . Presently the p vate cars and the cabs began to drop out . At each inter section they would turn this way or that , until at last o the hearse and the six Packards were left , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w broad and now almost empty , with a white line do the center that diminished on ahead into the smooth . phalt vacancy . Soon the hearse was making forty mil : an hour and then forty-five and then fifty . One of the cabs drew up at Miss Reba 's door . She g. out , followed by a thin woman in sober , severe cloth , and gold nose-glasses , and a short plump woman in plumed hat , her face hidden by a handkerchief , and small bullet-headed boy of five or six . The woman wi the handkerchief continued to sob in snuffy gasps as the went up the walk and entered the lattice . Beyond th house door the dogs set up a falsetto uproar . When MinP243nie opened the door they surged about Miss Reba 's feet . She kicked them aside . Again they assailed her with snappingeagerness ; again she flung them back against the wall in muted thuds . " Come in , come in , " she said , her hand to her breast . Once inside the house the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he look sweet ? " she wailed . " Did n't he look sweet ! " " Now , now , " Miss Reba said , leading the way to her room , " come in and have some beer . You 'll feel better . Minnie ! " They entered the room with the decorated dresser , the safe , the screen , the draped portrait . " Sit down , sit down , " she panted , shoving the chairs forward . She lowered herself into one and stooped terrifically towardher feet . " Uncle Bud , honey , " the weeping woman said , dabbing at her eyes , " come and unlace Miss Reba 's shoes . " The boy knelt and removed Miss Reba 's shoes . " And if you 'll just reach me them house slippers under the bed there , honey , " Miss Reba said . The boy fetched the slippers . Minnie entered , followed by the dogs . They rushed at Miss Reba and began to worry the shoes she had just removed . " Scat ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The dog 's head snapped around , its teeth clicking , its half-hidden eyes bright and malevolent . The boy recoiled . " You bite me , you thon bitch , " he said . " Uncle Bud ! " the fat woman said , her round face , rigid in fatty folds and streaked with tears , turned upon the boy in shocked surprise , the plumes nodding precari- ously above it . Uncle Bud 's head was quite round , nose bridged with freckles like splotches of huge summe rain on a sidewalk . The other woman sat primly erect , i gold nose-glasses on a gold chain and neat iron-gra hair . She looked like a school-teacher . " The very ideal the fat woman said . " How in the world he can learn such , words on an Arkansaw farm , I do nt know . " " They 'll learn meanness anywhere , " Miss Reba said Minnie leaned down a tray bearing three froste. tankards . Uncle Bud watched with round cornflower eye , as they took one each . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet ! " she wailed . " We all got to suffer it , " Miss Reba said . " Well , may i be a long day , " lifting her tankard . They drank , bowin formally to one another . The fat woman dried her eyes the two guests wiped their lips with prim decorum . Th thin one coughed delicately aside , behind her hand . " Such good beer , " she said . " Ai nt it ? " the fat one said . " I always say it 's the greate pleasure I have to call on Miss Reba . " They began to talk politely , in decorous half-corn pleted sentences , with little gasps of agreement . The bo had moved aimlessly to the window , peering benea the lifted shade . " How long 's he going to be with you , Miss Myrtle Miss Reba said . " Just till Sat'dy , " the fat woman said . " Then he 'll g. back home . It makes a right nice little change for him with me for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Children are such a comfort to a body , " the thin on , said .   " Yes , " Miss Myrtle said . " Is them two nice young fellowsstill with you , Miss Reba ? " " Yes , " Miss Reba said . " I think I got to get shut of them , though . I ai nt specially tender-hearted , but after all it ai nt no use in helping young folks to learn this world 's meanness until they have to . I already had to stop the girls running around the house without no clothes on , and they do nt like it . " They drank again , decorously , handling the tankards delicately , save Miss Reba , who grasped hers as though it were a weapon , her other hand lost in her breast . She set her tankard down empty . " I get so dry , seems like , " she said . " Wont you ladies have another ? " They murmured , ceremoniously . " Minnie ! " Miss Reba shouted . Minnie came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ashamed , " Miss Myrtle said . " But Miss Reba has such good beer . And then we 've all had a kind of upsettingafternoon . " " I 'm just surprised it was n't upset no more , " Miss Reba said . " Giving away all that free liquor like Gene done . " " It must have cost a good piece of jack , " the thin woman said . " I believe you , " Miss Reba said . " And who got anything out of it ? Tell me that . Except the privilege of havinghis place hell-full of folks not spending a cent . " She had set her tankard on the table beside her chair . Suddenlyshe turned her head sharply and looked at it . UncleBud was now behind her chair , leaning against the table . " You ai nt been into my beer , have you , boy ? " she said . " You , Uncle Bud , " Miss Myrtle said . " Ai nt youP246ashamed ?

He moved , in no particu direction . Miss Reba drank and set the tankard back o the table and rose . " Since we all been kind of tore up , " she said , " may . I can prevail on you ladies to have a little sup of gin ? " " No ; reely , " Miss Myrtle said . " Miss Reba 's the perfect hostess , " the thin one sal . " How many times you heard me say that , Miss Myrtle " I would n't undertake to say , dearie , " Miss Myrtle sal , Miss Reba vanished behind the screen . " Did you ever see it so warm for June , Miss Lorraine , Miss Myrtle said . " I never did , " the thin woman said . Miss Myrtle 's f. began to crinkle again .

" We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed formally and drank , patting their lips . Then they began to talk . They were all talking at once , again in half-completedsentences , but without pauses for agreement or affirmation . " It 's us girls , " Miss Myrtle said . " Men just cant seem to take us and leave us for what we are . They make us what we are , then they expect us to be different . Expect us not to never look at another man , while they come and go as they please . " " A woman that wants to fool with more than one man at a time is a fool , " Miss Reba said . " They 're all trouble , and why do you want to double your trouble ? And the woman that cant stay true to a good man when she gets him , a free-hearted spender that never give her a hour 's uneasiness or a hard word . . . " looking at them , her eyes began to fill with a sad , unutterable expression , of baffled and patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She leaned forward and patted Miss Reba 's huge hand .

For twenty-five years we was like two doves . "   " Now , dearie ; now , dearie , " Miss Myrtle said . " It 's when it comes over me like this , " Miss Reba sal . " Seeing that boy laying there under them flowers . " " He never had no more than Mr Binford had , " Mi Myrtle said . " Now , now . Drink a little beer .

" There was a Chinee robe she paid a hundred dollars for  --  imported , it was  --  and perfumeat ten dollars an ounce ; next morning when I went up there , they was all wadded in the corner and the perfumeand rouge busted all over them like a cyclone .

Now , you go over there by that window and stay there , you hear ? " " Nonsense , " Miss Reba said . " There was n't much left . You ladies are about ready too , ai nt you ? Minnie ! " Miss Lorraine touched her mouth with her handkerchief . Behind her glasses her eyes rolled aside in a veiled , secret look . She laid the other hand to her flat spinster 's breast . " We forgot about your heart , honey , " Miss Myrtle said . " Do nt you reckon you better take gin this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes ; do , " Miss Reba said . She rose heavily and fetches three more glasses of gin from behind the screen . Minni entered and refilled the tankards . They drank , patting their lips . " That 's what was going on , was it ? " Miss Lorraine sal . " First I knowed was when Minnie told me there was something funny going on , " Miss Reba said . " How h was n't here hardly at all , gone about every other nigh : and that when he was here , there was n't no signs at a the next morning when she cleaned up . She 'd hear the quarrelling , and she said it was her wanting to get o and he would n't let her .

Then and Red come back and stayed up there about an hour When they left , Minnie come and told me what was goin on , so next day I waited for them . I called him in her and I says Look here , you son of a buh  --  ' " She ceased For an instant the three of them sat motionless , a little forward . Then slowly their heads turned and they looked at the boy leaning against the table.  | " Uncle Bud , honey , " Miss Myrtle said , " do nt you want to go and play in the yard with Reba and Mr Binford ?

" He 'd ought to 've had sense enough to got a old ugly man , " Miss Myrtle said . " Tempting us poor girls like that . " " Men always expects us to resist temptation , " Miss Lorraine said .

Yes , sir , Minnie said the two of them would be nekkid as two snakes , and Popeye hanging over the foot of the bed without even his hat off , making a kind of whinnying sound . "  | " Maybe he was cheering for them , " Miss Lorraine said . " The lousy son of a bitch . " Feet came up the hall ; they could hear Minnie 's voi . lifted in adjuration . The door opened . She entered , holding Uncle Bud erect by one hand . Limp-kneed dangled , his face fixed in an expression of glassy idiocy ' " Miss Reba , " Minnie said , " this boy done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beer . You , boy ) she said , shaking him , " stan up ! " Limply he dangled , face rigid in a slobbering grin . Then upon it came an e pression of concern , consternation ; Minnie swung sharply away from her as he began to vomit . P153WHEN THE SUN rose , Horace had not been to bed nor even undressed . He was just finishing a letter to his wife , addressed to her at her father 's in Kentucky , asking for a divorce . He sat at the table , looking down at the single page written neatly and illegibly over , feeling quiet and empty for the first time since he had found Popeye watching him across the spring four weeks ago . While he was sitting there he began to smell coffee from somewhere . " I 'll finish this business and then I 'll go to Europe . I am sick . I am too old for this . I was born too old for it , and so I am sick to death for quiet . " He shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . When he passed the hotel , the bus which met the morning train was at the curb , with the drummersgetting into it . Clarence Snopes was one of them , carrying a tan suit case . " Going down to Jackson for a couple of days on a little business , " he said . " Too bad I missed you last night . I come on back in a car . I reckon you was settled for the night , maybe ? " He looked down at Horace , vast , pasty , his intention unmistakable . " I could have took you to a place most folks do nt know about . Where a man can do just whatever he is big enough to do . But there 'll be another time , since I done got to know you better . " He lowered his voice a little , moving a little aside . " Do nt you be un- ' easy . I ai nt a talker . When I 'm here , in Jefferson , I 'm one fellow ; what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 's business but mine and theirn . Ai nt that right ? " Later in the morning , from a distance he saw his sister on the street ahead of him turn and disappear into a door . He tried to find her by looking into all the stores within , the radius of where she must have turned , and asking the clerks . She was in none of them . The only place he did not investigate was a stairway that mounted between two stores , to a corridor of offices on the first floor , one of which was that of the District Attorney , Eustace Graham . Graham had a club foot , which had elected him tooffice he now held . He worked his way into and throughthe State University ; as a youth the town remembere. thim as driving wagons and trucks for grocery stores. , During his first year at the University he made a name ' for himself by his industry . He waited on table in the , commons and he had the government contract for carrying the mail to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbling along with the sack over his shoulder : a pleasant , open-faced young man with a wordfor everyone and a certain alert rapacity about the eyes . During his second year he let his mail contract lapse andP255he resigned from his job in the commons ; he also had a new suit . People were glad that he had saved through his industry to where he could give all his time to his studies . He was in the law school then , and the law professorsgroomed him like a race-horse . He graduated well , though without distinction . " Because he was handicappedat the start , " the professors said . " If he had had the same start that the others had . . . He will go far , " they said . It was not until he had left school that they learned that he had been playing poker for three years in the officeof a livery stable , behind drawn shades . When , two years out of school , he got elected to the State legislature , they began to tell an anecdote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in the livery stable office . The bet came to Graham . He looked across the table at the owner of the stable , who was his only remaining opponent . " How much have you got there , Mr Harris ? " he said . " Forty-two dollars , Eustace , " the proprietor said . Eustace shoved some chips into the pot . " How much is that ? " the proprietor said . " Forty-two dollars , Mr Harris . " " Hmmm , " the proprietor said . He examined his handy " How many cards did you draw , Eustace ? " " Three , Mr Harris . " " Hmmm . Who dealt the cards , Eustace ? " " I did , Mr Harris . " " I pass , Eustace . " He had been District Attorney but a short time , yd already he had let it be known that he would announce for Congress on his record of convictions , so when he found himself facing Narcissa across the desk in his dingy office , his expression was like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I only wish it were n't your brother , " he said . " I hate to see a brother-in-arms , you might say , with a bad case . " She was watching him with a blank , enveloping look . " After all , we 've got to protect society , even when it does seem that society does not need protection . " " Are you sure he cant win ? " she said . " Well , the first principle of law is , God alone knows what the jury will do . Of course , you cant expect  --  " " But you do nt think he will . " " Naturally , I  --  " " You have good reason to think he cant . I suppose you know things about it that he does n't . " He looked at her briefly . Then he picked up a pen from his desk and began to scrape at the point with a paper cutter . " This is purely confidential . I am violating my oath of office . I wont have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that he has n't a chance in the world . I know what the disappointment will be to ' him , but that cant be helped .

" If they hung the man and got it over with . " His hands became perfectly still . He did not look up . She said , her tone cold and level : " I have rea-P257sons for wanting Horace out of this case . The sooner the better . Three nights ago that Snopes , the one in the legislature , telephoned out home , trying to find him . The next day he went to Memphis . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out yourself . I just want Horace out of this business as soon as possible . " She rose and moved toward the door . He hobbled over to open it ; again she put that cold , still , unfathomable gaze upon him as though he were a dog or a cow ' and she waited for it to get out of her path . Then she was gone . He closed the door and struck a clumsy clog-step , snappinghis fingers just as the door opened again ; he snapped his hands toward his tie and looked at her in the door , holding it open . " What day do you think it will be over with ? " she said . " Why , I cub  --  Court opens the twentieth , " he said . " It will be the first case . Say . . . Two days . Or three at the most , with your kind assistance . And I need not assure you that this will be held in strictest confidence between us He moved toward her , but her blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be the twenty-fourth . " Then she was looking at him again . " Thank you , " she said , and closed the door . That night she wrote Belle that Horace would be home on the twenty-fourth . She telephoned Horace and asked for Belle 's address . " Why ? " Horace said . " I 'm going to write her a letter , " she said , her voice tranquil , without threat . Dammit , Horace thought , holding the dead wire in his hand , How can I be ex- petted to combat people who will not even employ subterfuge . But soon he forgot it , forgot that she had called . He did not see her again before the trial opened . Two days before it opened Snopes emerged from a dentist 's office and stood at the curb , spitting . He took a gold-wrapped cigar from his pocket and removed the foil and put the cigar gingerly between his teeth . He had a black eye , and the bridge of his nose was bound in soiled adhesive tape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told them in the barber-shop . " But do nt think I never made the bastard pay , " he said , showing a sheaf of yellowbills . He put them into a notecase and stowed it away . " I am an American , " he said . " I do nt brag about it , because I was born one . And I been a decent Baptist all my life , too . Oh , I ai nt no preacher and I ai nt no old ' maid ; I been around with the boys now and then , but I reckon I ai nt no worse than lots of folks that pretends to sing loud in church . But the lowest , cheapest thing on this earth ai nt a nigger : it 's a jew . We need laws against them . Drastic laws . When a durn lowlife jew can come to a free country like this and just because he 's got a law degree , it 's time to put a stop to things . A jew is the lowestthing on this creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . And the lowest kind of jew lawyer is a Memphisjew lawyer . When a jew lawyer can hold up an American , a white man , and not give him but ten dollars for something that two Americans , Americans , southron gentlemen ; a judge living in the capital of the State of Mississippi and a lawyer that 's going to be as big a man as his pa some day , and a judge too ; when they give himP259ten times as much for the same thing than the lowlife jew , we need a law . I been a liberal spender all my life ; whatever I had has always been my friends ' too . But when a durn , stinking , lowlife jew will refuse to pay an American one tenth of what another American , and a judge at that  --  " " Why did you sell it to him , then ? " the barber said . " What ? " Snopes said . The barber was looking at him . " What was you hying to sell to that car when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar , " Snopes said . P260THE TRIAL was set for the twentieth of June . A week after his Memphis visit , Horace telephoned Miss Reba . " Just to know if she 's still there , " he said . " So I can reach her if I need to . " " She 's here , " Miss Reba said . " But this reaching . I do nt like it . I do nt want no cops around here unless they are on my business . " " It 'll be only a bailiff , " Horace said . " Someone to hand a paper into her own hand . " " Let the postman do it , then , " Miss Reba said . " He comes here anyway . In a uniform too . He do nt look no worse in it than a full-blowed cop , neither . Let him do it . " " I wont bother you , " Horace said . " I wont make you any trouble . " " I know you ai nt , " Miss Reba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire . " I ai nt going to let you . Minnie 's done took a crying spell tonight , over that bastard that lFSft her , and me and Miss Myrtle was sitting here , andP261we got started crying too . Me and Minnie and Miss Myrtle . We drunk up a whole new bottle of gin . I cant afford that . So do nt you be sending no jay cops up here with no letters for nobody . You telephone me and I 'll turn them both out on the street and you can have them arrested there . " On the night of the nineteenth he telephoned her again . He had some trouble in getting in touch with her . " They 're gone , " she said . " Both of them . Do nt you read no papers ? " " What papers ? " Horace said . " Hello . Hello ! " " They ai nt here no more , I said , " Miss Reba said . " I do nt know nuttin about them and I do nt want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week 's room rent on  --  " " But cant you find where she went to ? I may need her . " " I do nt know nuttin and I do nt want to know nuttin , " Miss Reba said . He heard the receiver click . Yet the disconnectionwas not made at once . He heard the receiver thud onto the table where the telephone sat , and he could hear Miss Reba shouting for Minnie : " Minnie . Minnie ! " Then some hand lifted the receiver and set it onto the hook ; the wire clicked in his ear . After a while a detachedDelsarte-ish voice said : " Pine Bluff dizzent . . . Enkyew ! " The trial opened the next day . On the table lay the sparse objects which the District Attorney was offering : the bullet from Tommy 's skull , a stoneware jug containingcorn whiskey . " I will call Mrs Goodwin to the stand , " Horace said .   He did not look back . He could feel Goodwin 's eyes on his back as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the child lying on her lap . She repeated the story as she had told it to him on the day after the child was ill . Twice Goodwin tried to interrupt and was silenced by the Court . Horace would not look at him . The woman finished her story . She sat erect in the chair , in her neat , worn gray dress and hat with the darned veil , the purple ornament on her shoulder . The child lay on her lap , its eyes closed in that drugged immobility . For a while her hand hovered about its face , performing those needless maternal actions as though unawares . Horace went and sat down . Then only did he look at Goodwin . But the other sat quietly now , his arms folded and his head bent a little , but Horace could see that his nostrils were waxy white with rage against his dark face . He leaned toward him and whispered , but Goodwin did not move . The District Attorney now faced the woman . " Mrs Goodwin , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Goodwin ? " " I object ! " Horace said , on his feet . " Can the prosecution show how this question is relevant ? " the Court said . " I waive , your Honor , " the District Attorney said , glancing at the jury . When court adjourned for the day Goodwin said bit .. terly : " Well , you 've said you would kill me someday , bus . I did n't think you meant it . I did n't think that you ' " Do nt be a fool , " Horace said . " Do nt you see your caseP263is won ? That they are reduced to trying to impugn the character of your witness ? " But when they left the jail he found the woman still watching him from some deep reserveof foreboding . " You must n't worry at all , I tell you . You may know more about making whiskey or love than I do , but I know more about criminal procedure than you , remember . " " You do nt think I made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do nt you see how that explodes their case ? The best they can hope for now is a hung jury . And the chances of that are not one in fifty . I tell you , he 'll walk out of that jail tomorrow a free man . " " Then I guess it 's time to think about paying you . " " Yes , " Horace said , " all right . I 'll come out tonight . " " Tonight ? " " Yes . He may call you back to the stand tomorrow . We 'd better prepare for it , anyway . " At eight oclock he entered the mad woman 's yard . A single light burned in the crazy depths of the house , like a firefly caught in a brier patch , but the woman did not appear when he called . He went to the door and knocked . A shrill voice shouted something ; he waited a moment . He was about to knock again when he heard the voice again , shrill and wild and faint , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an avalanche . He circled the house in the rank , waist-high weeds . The kitchen door was open . The lamp was there , dim in a smutty chimney , filling the room  --  a jumble of looming shapes rank with old foul female flesh  --  not with light but with shadow . White eyeballs rolled in a high , tight bullet head in brown gleams above a torn singlet strapped into overalls . Beyond the Negro the mad woman turned in an open cupboard , brushing her lank hair back with her forearm . " Your bitch has gone to jail , " she said . " Go on with her . " " Jail ? " Horace said . " That 's what I said . Where the good folks live . When you get a husband , keep him in jail where he cant bother you . " She turned to the negro , a small flask in her hand . " Come on , dearie . Give me a dollar for it . You got plenty money . " Horace returned to town , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the jailer locked a door behind him . The woman admitted him to the cell . The child lay on the cot . Goodwin sat beside it , his arms crossed , his legs extended in the attitude of a man in the last stage of physicalexhaustion . " Why are you sitting there , in front of that slit ? " Horacesaid . " Why not get into the corner , and we 'll put the mattress over you . " " You come to see it done , did you ? " Goodwin said . " Well , that 's no more than right . It 's your job . You promisedI would n't hang , did n't you ? " " You 've got an hour yet , " Horace said . " The Memphis train does n't get here until eight-thirty . He 's surely got better sense than to come here in that canary-colored car . " He turned to the woman . " But you . I thought better of you . I know that he and I are fools , but I expected betterof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , " Goodwin said . " She might have hung on with me until she was too old to hustle aP265good man . If you 'll just promise to get the kid a newspapergrift when he 's old enough to make change , I 'll be easy in my mind . " The woman had returned to the cot . She lifted the child onto her lap . Horace went to her . He said : " You come on , now . Nothing 's going to happen . He 'll be all right here . He knows it . You 've got to go home and get some sleep , because you 'll both be leaving here tomorrow . Come , now . " " I reckon I better stay , " she said . " Damn it , do nt you know that putting yourself in the position for disaster is the surest way in the world to bring it about ? Has n't your own experience shown you that ? Lee knows it . Lee , make her stop this . " " Go on , Ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . " " I reckon I better stay , " she said . Horace stood over them . The woman mused above the child , her face bent and her whole body motionless . Goodwin leaned back against the wall , his brown wrists folded into the faded sleeves of his shirt . " You 're a man now , " Horace said . " Are n't you ? I wish that jury could see you now , locked up in a concrete cell , scaring women and children with fifth grade ghost stories . They 'd know you never had the guts to kill anybody . " " You better go on and go to bed yourself , " Goodwin said . " We could sleep here , if there was n't so much noise going on . " " No ; that 's too sensible for us to do , " Horace said . He left the cell . The jailer unlocked the door for him and he quitted the building . In ten minutes he returned , with a parcel . Goodwin had not moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of milk , a box of candy , a box of cigars . He gave Goodwin one of the cigars and took one himself . " You brought his bottle , did n't you ? " The woman produced the bottle from a bundle beneath the cot . " It 's got some in it , " she said . She filled it from the bottle . Horace lit his and Goodwin 's cigars . When he looked again the bottle was gone . " Not time to feed him yet ? " he said . " I 'm warming it , " the woman said . " Oh , " Horace said . He tilted the chair against the wall , across the cell from the cot . " Here 's room on the bed , " the woman said . " It 's softer . Some . " " Not enough to change , though , " Horace said . " Look here , " Goodwin said , " you go on home . No use in you doing this . " " We 've got a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer 'll call her again in the morning . That 's his only chance : to invalidate her testimony someway . You might try to get some sleep while we go over it . " " All right , " Goodwin said . Horace began to drill the woman , tramping back and forth upon the narrow floor . Goodwin finished his cigar and sat motionless again , his arms folded and his head bent . The clock above the square struck nine and then ten . The child whimpered , stirred . The woman stopped and changed it and took the bottle from beneath her flank and fed it . Then she leaned forward carefully and looked into Goodwin 's face . " He 's asleep , " she whispered.  | " Shall we lay him down ? " Horace whispered . " No . Let him stay there . " Moving quietly she laid the child on the cot and moved herself to the other end of it . Horace carried the chair over beside her . They spoke in whispers . The clock struck eleven . Still Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last he said : " I think that 's all . Can you remember it , now ? If he should ask you anything you cant answer in the exact words you 've learned tonight , just say nothing for a moment . I 'll attend to the rest . Can you remember , now ? " " Yes , " she whispered . He reached across and took the box of candy from the cot and opened it , the glazed papercrackling faintly . She took a piece . Goodwin had not moved . She looked at him , then at the narrow slit of window . " Stop that , " Horace whispered . " He could n't reach him through that window with a hat-pin , let alone a bullet . Do nt you know that ? " " Yes , " she said . She held the bon-bon in her hand . She was not looking at him . " I know what you 're thinking , " she whispered . " What ? " " When you got to the house and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horace watched her , her averted face . " You said tonight was the time to start paying you . " For a while longer he looked at her . " Ah , " he said . " 0 tempora ! 0 mores ! O hell ! Can you stupid mammals never believe that any man , every man  --  You thought that was what I was coming for ? You thought that if I had intended to , I 'd have waited this long ? "  | She looked at him briefly . " It would n't have done you any good if you had n't waited . " " What ? Oh . Well . But you would have tonight ? " " I thought that was what  --  " " You would now , then ? " She looked around at Goodwin . He was snoring a little . " Oh , I do nt mean right this minute , " he whispered . " But you 'll pay on demand . " " I thought that was what you meant . I told you we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do nt know that I blame you . " " It 's not that . You know it 's not that . But cant you see that perhaps a man might do something just because he knew it was right , necessary to the harmony of things that it be done ? " The woman turned the bon-bon slowly in her hand . " I thought you were mad about him . " " Lee ? " " No . Him . " She touched the child . " Because I 'd have to bring him with us . " " You mean , with him at the foot of the bed , maybe ? perhaps you holding him by the leg all the time , so he would n't fall off ? " She looked at him , her eyes grave and blank and contemplative . Outside the clock struck twelve . " Good God , " he whispered . " What kind of men have you known ? " " I got him out of jail once that way . Out of Leavenworth , too . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horace said . " Here . Take another piece . That one 's about worn out . " " She looked down at her chocolate-stained fingers and the shapeless bon-bon . Shep269dropped it behind the cot . Horace extended his handkerchief . " It 'll soil it , " she said . " Wait . " She wiped her fingers on the child 's discarded garment and sat again , her hands clasped in her lap . Goodwin was snoring regularly . " When he went to the Philippines he left me in San Francisco . I got a job and I lived in a hall room , cooking over a gas-jet , because I told him I would . I did n't know how long he 'd be gone , but I promised him I would and he knew I would . When he killed that other soldier over that nigger woman , I did n't even know it . I did n't get a letter from him for five months . It was just when I happened to see an old newspaper I was spreading on a closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regiment was coming home , and when I looked at the calendar it was that day . I 'd been good all that time . I 'd had good chances ; every day I had them with the men coming in the restaurant . " They would n't let me off to go and meet the ship , so I had to quit . Then they would n't let me see him , would n't even let me on the ship . I stood there while they came marching off it , watching for him and asking the ones that passed if they knew where he was and them kidding me if I had a date that night , telling me they never heard of him or that he was dead or he had run off to Japan with the colonel 's wife . I tried to get on the ship again , but they would n't let me . So that night I dressed up and went to the cabarets until I found one of them and let him pick me up , and he told me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music playing and all , and that drunk soldier pawing at me , and me wondering why I did n't let go , go on with him , get drunk and never sober up again and me thinking And this is the sort of animal 1 wasted a year over . I guess that was why I did n't . " Anyway , I did n't . I went back to my room and the next day I started looking for him . I kept on , with them telling me lies and trying to make me , until I found he was in Leavenworth . I did n't have enough money for a ticket , so I had to get another job . It took two months to get enough money . Then I went to Leavenworth . I got another job as waitress , in Childs , nightshifts , so I could see Lee every other Sunday afternoon . We decided to get a lawyer . We did n't know that a lawyer could n't do anything for a federal prisoner . The lawyer did n't tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer . He thought I had saved some money . I lived with the lawyer two months before I found it out . " Then the war came and they let Lee out and sent him to France . I went to New York and got a job in a munitionsplant . I stayed straight too , with the cities full of soldiers with money to spend , and even the little ratty girls wearing silk . But I stayed straight . Then he came home . I was at the ship to meet him . He got off under arrestand they sent him back to Leavenworth for killing that soldier three years ago . Then I got a lawyer to get a Congressman to get him out . I gave him all the money I had saved too . So when Lee got out , we had nothing . He said we 'd get married , but we could n't afford it . And when I told him about the lawyer , he beat me . " Again she dropped a shapeless piece of candy behind the cot and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the box and ate it . Chewing ,  |p271she  looked at Horace , turning upon him a blank , musing gaze for an unhurried moment . Through the slotted windowthe darkness came chill and dead . Goodwin ceased snoring . He stirred and sat up . " What time is it ? " he said . " What ? " Horace said . He looked at his watch . " Halfpasttwo . " " He must have had a puncture , " Goodwin said . Toward dawn Horace himself slept , sitting in the chair . When he waked a narrow rosy pencil of sunlight fell level through the window . Goodwin and the woman were talkingquietly on the cot . Goodwin looked at him bleakly . " Morning , " he said . " I hope you slept off that nightmare of yours , " Horace said . " If I did , it 's the last one I 'll have . They say you do nt dream there . " " You 've certainly done enough not to miss it , " Horace said . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe , hell , " Goodwin said , who had sat so quiet , so contained , with his saturnine face , negligent in his overallsand blue shirt ; " do you think for one minute that man is going to let me walk out of that door and up the street and into that courthouse , after yesterday ? What sort of men have you lived with all your life ? In a nursery ? I would n't do that , myself . " " If he does , he has sprung his own trap , " Horace said . " What good will that do me ? Let me tell  --  " " Lee , " the woman said.  --  " you something : the next time you want to play dice with a man 's neck  --  "  | " Lee , " she said . She was stroking her hand slowly on his head , back and forth . She began to smooth his hair into a part , patting his collarless shirt smooth . Horace watched them . " Would you like to stay here today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " No , " Goodwin said . " I 'm sick of it . I 'm going to get it over with . Just tell that goddamned deputy not to walk too close to me . You and her better go and eat break-fast . " " I 'm not hungry , " the woman said . " You go on like I told you , " Goodwin said . " Lee . " " Come , " Horace said . " You can come back afterward . " Outside , in the fresh morning , he began to breathe deeply . " Fill your lungs , " he said . " A night in that place would give anyone the jimjams . The idea of three grown people . . . My Lord , sometimes I believe that we are all children , except children themselves . But today will be the last . By noon he 'll walk out of there a free man : do you realise that ? " They walked on in the fresh sunlight , beneath the high , soft sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the south-west , and the cool steady breeze shiveredand twinkled in the locusts where the blooms had long since fallen . " I do nt know how you 'll get paid , " she said . " Forget it . I 've been paid . You wont understand it , but my soul has served an apprenticeship that has lasted for forty-three years . Forty-three years . Half again as long asP273you have lived . So you see that folly , as well as poverty , cares for its own . " " And you know that he  --  that  --  " " Stop it , now . We dreamed that away , too . God is foolishat times , but at least He 's a gentleman . Do nt you know that ? " " I always thought of Him as a man , " the woman said . The bell was already ringing when Horace crossed the square toward the courthouse . Already the square was filled with wagons and cars and the overalls and khaki thronged slowly beneath the gothic entrance of the building . Overhead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The broad double doors at the head of the cramped stair were open . From beyond them came a steady preliminarystir of people settling themselves . Above the seat-backs Horace could see their heads  --  bald heads , gray heads , shaggy heads and heads trimmed to recent feather-edge above sun-baked necks , oiled heads above urban collars and here and there a sunbonnet or a floweredhat . The hum of their voices and movements came back upon the steady draft which blew through the door . The air entered the open windows and blew over the heads and back to Horace in the door , laden with smells of tobaccoand stale sweat and the earth and with that unmistakableodor of courtrooms ; that musty odor of spent lusts and greeds and bickerings and bitterness , and withal a certain clumsy stability in lieu of anything bet- ter . The windows gave upon balconies close under the arched porticoes . The breeze drew through them , bearingthe chirp and coo of sparrows and pigeons that nested in the eaves , and now and then the sound of a motorhorn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow rumble of feet in the corridor below and on the stairs . The Bench was empty . At one side , at the long table , he could see Goodwin 's black head and gaunt brown face , and the woman 's gray hat . At the other end of the table sat a man picking his teeth . His skull was capped closely by tightly-curled black hair thinning upon a bald spot . He had a long , pale nose . He wore a tan palm beach suit ; upon the table near him lay a smart leather brief-case and a straw hat with a red-and-tan band , and he gazed lazily out a window above the ranked heads , picking his teeth . Horace stopped just within the door . " It 's a lawyer , " he said . " A Jew lawyer from Memphis . " Then he was looking at the backs of the heads about the table , where the witnesses and such would be . " I know what I 'll find before I find it , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up the aisle . From beyond the balcony window where the sound of the bell seemed to be and where beneath the eaves the guttural pigeons crooned , the voice of the bailiff came : " The honorable Circuit Court of Yoknapatawpha county is now open according to law .. . . Temple had on a black hat . The clerk called her name twice before she moved and took the stand . After a whilep275Horace realised that he was being spoken to , a little testily , by the Court . " Is this your witness , Mr Benbow ? " " It is , your Honor . " " You wish her sworn and recorded ? " " I do , your Honor . " Beyond the window , beneath the unhurried pigeons , the bailiff 's voice still droned , reiterant , importunate , and detached , though the sound of the bell had ceased.
