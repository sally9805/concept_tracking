Dino Grandi . Italian Ambassador to Great Britain , two years ago appeared in London wearing a suit made from 48 pints of skimmed milk . Secretary Achille Starace of the Fascist Party decreed that all party flags must be made from " this product of Italian ingenuity " a textile fabric called Lanital , invented in 1935 and introduced in the U. S. last winter ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . Basis of Lanital is casein , the thick substance in sour , skimmed milk from which cottage cheese is made . Last week the U. S. Department of Agriculture 's Bureau of Dairy Industry applied for a public-service patent on a somewhat similar process for turning casein into synthetic wool . <P> Years ago dairies used to dump their surplus casein , later discovered their dumping grounds had become fertile fields . In 1898 , Casein Co. of America started making casein commercially . Manufacturing process is relatively simple : after skim milk , which has a 3% casein content , has soured , the curd ( crude casein ) is separated from the whey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the finished product . Since 1921 U. S. production of casein has risen from 8,000,000 to 40,000,000 Ib. annually . Biggest consumers are paper makers ( who use 70% of the yearly output for coating book , magazine and wall paper ) , paint and glue manufacturers ( 12% each ) and the plastic industry . <P> Inventors of the new synthetic wool are two Government chemists named Stephen P. Gould and Earl O. Whittier . They produced the fiber by a method similar to that used in making rayon from cellulose . The finished product is straw-colored , resembles the best grade , washed and carded Merino wool , but will not shrink so much and is mothproof . By varying the acids used in curdling the milk they claim they can make a soft , silky grade or a hard , stronger type of yarn . Although Messrs . Gould and Whittier do not know exactly what it will cost to produce synthetic wool commercially , they are certain it can be sold about as cheaply as rayon ( 50 a Ib . ) . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably release them to the general public without restrictions .
