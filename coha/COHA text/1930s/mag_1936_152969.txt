Two Japanese , each of medium height , each with a heavily wrinkled face , small clipped white mustache and a nearly bald head , put on their sleeping kimonos in the official residence of the Premier of Japan one dark and snowy night last week , laid their heads upon pillows of hard wood and went to sleep . <P> Sprinting through the snow shortly before 5 A. M. went a group of resolute figures in the mustard-colored uniform of the Japanese Army , lugging with them a few machine guns . They dashed through the Premier 's gates and with rifle butts stove in the Premier 's door . Rushing in they found a Japanese of medium height with a heavily wrinkled face , small clipped white mustache and nearly bald head whose sleeping kimono flapped about his knees in the wintry gusts from the broken door . <P> Screamed one of the mustards : " Premier Admiral Keisuke Okada , we have come to execute you ! Politics must be purified . " <P> Confusion was complete as to exactly what next occurred . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolted , then sprawled dead . Other " eye witnesses " told of a bland and bold acquiescence in the " execution " by Wrinkle-Face , who quietly walked out into the garden and stood up to a firing squad which shot him down . In either case mortally wounded Wrinkle-Face collapsed in a great splotch of his blood upon the snow , and one of the mustards threw a piece of matting over the corpse which was soon covered by the falling flakes . <P> Other mustards with guns had meanwhile burst into the home of 81-year-old and proverbially lucky Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi . To compare him with Secretary of the U. S. Treasury Andrew William Mellon at the zenith of that statesman 's fame as " The Greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton " would not be far off the mark . As Mr. Takahashi 's son , who works in Manhattan , said last week , " Father was always trying to balance the Japanese budget even when we were still little children . " Tall and vigorous , emphatically the Great Takahashi , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustards broke into his bedroom and shrilled bravely , " What are you trying to do ? " <P> For answer a Japanese officer 's heavy sword then &; there hacked , slashed and butchered the greatest Japanese Finance Minister in all history . <P> Still other young mustards with machine guns had by this time burst into the bed chamber of Viscount Makoto Saito , Lord Keeper of the sacred Privy Seal of His Imperial Majesty the Son of Heaven , Emperor Hirohito . Old Saito had been a valiant admiral and from 1932 to 1934 was Premier of Japan . Two machine guns now poked their snouts in his direction and youthful mustards were at the triggers . <P> " Shoot me first ! " screamed Viscountess Saito darting forward and clapping her hand over the muzzle of the nearest machine gun . Instantly both trigger fingers clenched and the double roar of ZUG-ZUG-ZUG began . Bloody was the brave Viscountess ' hand as her lord , the Admiral and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal crumpled and died under the murderous fusillade .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
