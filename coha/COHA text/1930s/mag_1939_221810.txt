Painful to U. S. airlines is the dizzy rate at which transport planes grow obsolete . In 1933 United Air Lines paid $2,500,000 for 55 Boeing 247s . Within six months the new Douglas DC2 outloaded , outsped them . When T.W.A. bought a fleet of DC-2s , United spent $1,500,000 more revamping its Boeings . But Douglas engineers were already mocking-up ( building a model ) the still bigger &; better DC-3 . <P> Lest this cut throat competition spill too much of aviation 's lifeblood , United 's President William Allan Patterson approached T.W.A. , American , Pan American and Eastern with a bold proposition : let them finance a common plane that would standardize equipment . Such a plane he foresaw as the DC-4 . It would carry 42 passengers , four engines , travel at 240 m.p.h . Six months later the Big Five contracted not to invest in any transport heavier than 43,500 lbs . other than the DC-4 . Each company could then be dealt one apiece for as many rounds as they mutually agreed upon . If , however , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly line . <P> But to Mr. Patterson 's dismay in 1937 Pan American ordered Boeing 307s just under the weight limit . Later American and T.W.A. began flirting with heavy planes . <P> Last week as the option deadline lapsed , the four stayed clam-silent . This meant that United might have to pay more for the six DC-4s it bought last fortnight . But it also meant that if President Patterson 's hunch is sound , when the DC-4s are operating in 1941 , United might bag the lion 's share of transcontinental air traffic .
