Keen , mellow and eminent among Federal jurists is 70-year-old Julian William Mack , who sits on the U. S. Circuit Court in New York . A realistic Zionist , Judge Mack overcame his detestation of titular honors last summer to accept honorary presidency of the First World Jewish Congress in Geneva . Devoted to the sanity of the law , he has shown a liberalism no less profound , if less spectacular than that of his old friend , Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis . His decision in the famed anti-trust case against the Sugar Institute in 1934 stands as a weighty legal precedent in the interpretation of " fair trade practice . " On the morning of Armistice Day last week Judge Mack sat down in the big , airy room of the new Federal District Court in Manhattan 's Foley Square to hear arguments in another great test case , this one brought by the Securities &; Exchange Commission against the world 's biggest electric utility holding company , Electric Bond &; Share . <P> For utility counsel who came primed , after nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Utility Act was unconstitutional , or at least to obtain a ruling on that point in order to appeal it , SEC 's smart Attorney Robert Houghwout Jackson immediately opened a tricky gambit . He suggested that since Electric Bond &; Share had never registered with SEC as the Utility Act required , the point at issue was not the constitutionality of the Act as a whole but that of its registration provisions . Electric Bond &; Share , argued Attorney Jackson , was on an illegal spot . It could not call the constitutionality of the Act in question until it should be in a position to object to SEC 's procedure . He prayed the Court either to order registration or to enjoin Bond &; Share from interstate business . <P> On the broader question of SEC 's grant of power , Attorney Jackson went into detail on the evils of holding company pyramids discovered in the Federal Trade Commission 's survey of 2,300 utilities , on which the Utility Act was based . Conceding that Electric Bond &; Share was not necessarily guilty of these evils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those in which corporate bubbles had been known to form . He trotted out charts to show that 48% of the gas and 28% of the electricity distributed by Bond &; Share 's multitudinous subsidiaries were conducted across State lines . He mentioned the inability of State power commissions to deal with utilities operating within their territories but not legally subject to their jurisdiction . Said he , with a nod to Judge Mack 's known sentiments on monopoly : <P> " Can it be that a diseased cow can be kept out of interstate commerce , but this pyramided system for the control of other people 's money can be sold without any supervision ? . . .
