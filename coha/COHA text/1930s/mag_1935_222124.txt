At Chicago 's Century of Progress a young chemical engineer who teaches at Yale went about inspecting the welter of exhibits purporting to show what Science had done for Mankind . What he saw did not impress Engineer Clifford Cook Furnas . The festoons of electric lights , he knew , burned with an efficiency of less than 2% . The television was blurry . The loudspeakers were squawky . There were sleek , fast automobiles which converted less than a tenth of their fuel into motive power . Display after display recounted the triumphs of medicine while a preventable outbreak of amebic dysentery in Chicago sickened 721 people , killed 41 . <P> Dr. Furnas , 35 , decided to write a book not about the Fair , but about the multitude of questions it did not answer , the problems not yet solved . This week he publishes The Next Hundred Years : The Unfinished Business of Science , * in which he displays a vast store of information in fields other than his own , and in casual , lucid style examines the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of two January choices of the Book-of-the-Month Club ( see p. 35 ) . <P> Some matters like television and smoke elimination are already overdue , while others such as the synthesis of living matter and the explanation of old age may not be realized for thousands of years . Thus , despite his title , it is no cocky portrait of 2035 that Author Furnas paints . " We can not see the goal , " he observes , " but we can see the nearer sections of the road leading to it . After all , that is the part that interests us most . . . . We need something better than leather , and a raincoat that lets body moisture out . We need road surfaces that will last at least a century and roofs that will never leak . We need a superconductor for electricity . We need artificial teeth that are as good as natural , . . . paper as permanent as parchment , fabrics and dyes that wind and sun can not touch , a spring metal that will not fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need a satisfactory anesthetic for childbirth . " <P> Autopsy surgeons can spot a lifelong city-dweller by the accumulation of soot in his lungs . Effect of this on health remains unknown , but there is no doubt that coal smoke is a costly nuisance . Dr. Furnas foresees cities made clean by complete conversion of coal into fuel gas at the mine , by piping the clean-burning gas to metropolitan centres . Gas distilled from coal leaves a coke residue-which can also be converted by the water-gas process . Currently , artificial gas for heating is a luxury because it takes about $48 worth to equal a ton of coal . Three-fourths of that cost goes for distribution . If it were consumed on a vast scale in factories and homes the cost would be diminished to a point where few people could afford not to use it . Then U. S. grime would be localized in the mining centres which would send out not only fuel by pipeline but electric current by long-distance superconducting cables .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
