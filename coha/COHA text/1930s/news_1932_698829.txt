txt Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey has recently placed on sale a third-grade gaSoline , marketed as " Acto " gasoline , at various of its service stations in New Jersey . This action was taken to meet price-cutting tactics on the part of nearby dealers . With the third-grade gasoline the company is in position to meet competition by reducing the quotation on this grade , at the same time maintaining its prices on the standard grades . Marketing of a third grade is not entirely a new departure for the Jersey company . Some time ago a subsidiary , Standard Oil Co. of Pennsylvania , placed a third grade gasoline on the market in various parts of its territory to counteract price-cutting tactics . The Jersey company , it is understood , intends to restrict the sale of the new gasoline to service stations in areas where undercutting is prevalent . Thus far the company has found that the new gasoline has had a beneficial effect on sales of its standard grades .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
