Last week in Manhattan the CWA evolved a plan to aid actors without also lining the pockets of stage hands , producers , ushers and ticket speculators . Twelve plays including The First Year , She Stoops to Conquer , The Show-Off and The Late Christopher Bean were picked for production in high-school auditoriums . The action of each play had to take place in one set to avoid the expense of scene-shifting . Admission would be free .

Twelve directors , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theatres , school auditoriums , hotel rooms .
