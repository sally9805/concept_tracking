The island Republic of Haiti is mountainous , suited to guerrilla revolutions . It is tropical , suited to a lazy , roistering populace . Towering on bold Cap Haitien , the citadel La Ferrire ( built under the lash of black King Henri Christophe , who reigned from 1811 to 1820 ) stands sole witness to the potentialities of organized , industrious Haiti citizens . Since the time of King Christophe , especially since 1915 when the U. S. assumed responsibility for quelling wholesale murders in Haiti , nothing , not even U. S. Marines , has made the Haitians a nation worthy of La Ferrire . Last year President Hoover thought that something more should be done . He sent one more commission to investigate Haitian conditions . Its recommendation : withdrawal of U. S. paternal offices , restoration of national status . <P> Last week the President of the U. S. appointed a Minister to Haiti . He is Dana Gardner Munro , 38 , studious son of that scholarly father , Princeton 's Professor of Medieval History , Dr. Dana Carleton Munro . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Department of State 's Division of Latin-American Affairs , author of an authoritative book on Central America . <P> That Minister Munro ought to get on well with his easy-going tropical hosts is suggested by a story told on him in Washington . Invited to dinner at the White House , he and Mrs. Munro arrived 30 min. late , were advised by Chief Usher Ike Hoover to dine elsewhere . On another occasion , dilatory Dana Munro arrived late with a speech-of-state which he had prepared for the President to deliver .
