Belgium 's Fascist party , the Rexists , led by Lon Degrelle , frankly resorts to burglary and theft to obtain private papers with which to smear its opponents . Such tactics drove from office Premier Paul van Zeeland , although he later vindicated himself in the Belgian Parliament . By last week Rexists had turned their attention to Minister of Health Arthur Wauters . <P> With the aid of two letters they tried to prove that Minister Wauters was guilty of selling military planes and munitions to Spanish Leftists despite Belgian adherence to the Non-intervention Committee . Admittedly the two letters had been stolen from M. Wauters ' desk . In the chamber M. Wauters was able to prove : that the planes were three obsolete Fokkers of no military use , bought in August 1936 , several months before M. Wauters was a Cabinet Minister , a week before Belgium entered the Non-intervention agreement , and 2 ) that the planes are still in Belgium . <P> Health Minister Wauters had hardly refuted this accusation when a Rexist Deputy swaggered up to Belgium 's present namby-pamby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope supposedly containing evidence for further charges against Wauters . At this new example of fascism turned smearism , the mild Premier for once showed spunk . " Did you , sir , steal these ? " he shrilled . " And where ? " Then he treated the Chamber to a denunciation of Rexist tactics , dramatically returned the unopened envelope to its purveyor.
