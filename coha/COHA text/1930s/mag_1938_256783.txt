Peaceful , bomb-fearing Britons have for years been notably anxious to have Europe 's air fleets limited by some kind of pact . Journalistic furor in London was therefore immense last week when unconfirmed rumors began buzzing that at Munich three weeks ago fat Field Marshal Hermann Gring genially told lean Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that an air pact not only is a good idea but ought to be signed on the basis that Germany can have three planes for every British one . <P> Often a jest by the ebullient Gring reflects what he knows to be in the mind of his friend Hitler , who seldom jokes . To the solemn Fhrer it is an unanswerably simple proposition that Britain should be willing to give him tit for tat . Tat is the Treaty of 1935 by which the German Navy was limited to 35% of the size of the British Navy , plus the Treaty of 1937 by which qualitative limitation of the two navies with respect to each other was fixed . Tit would be the ratio at which , after diplomatic trading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the British Royal Air Force . <P> Almost certainly Hitler and Gring think air power will soon have made sea power obsolete , but they know the British Admiralty is full of crusty heroes ready to swear that " By gad , Sir , none of your dashed bombers has ever sunk a modern capital ship and they have n't taken Madrid . The Navy is still the Navy , Sir , and England is still England . " In that atmosphere , which seems very favorable to modern Germans , an air pact conceivably may be signed . Its drafters will have to take into consideration first the quantitative air strengths of the great powers . These were estimated at Washington last week in quarters close to the Navy Department . Based on figures for all kinds of effective fighting craft ( day &; night bombers , fighting , reconnaissance , transport ) they follow : <P> Soviet Union 5,000 to 6,500 planes <P> Germany 4,000 " 4,500 " <P> Italy 3,700 " 4,200 " <P> France 3,200 " 3,500 " <P> Britain 3,000 " 3,500 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500 <P> Other Factors . Any quantitative estimate must be corrected not so much for qualitative factors-although these are important-as in the light of how rapidly each great power is increasing its yearly or monthly production of reasonably effective fighting aircraft . In acceleration of aircraft production Germany has pioneered , led the whole European field and may still be leading , despite frantic efforts to accelerate production by the other great powers , notably Britain . Gring has been to the European war plane what Ford was to the car , and Lord Nuffield is only now entering the air race as Britain 's Big Builder. * <P> In technical opinion , Spain has been unsatisfactory , perhaps even misleading , as a war testing ground for aircraft . This war , despite all its unspeakable horrors , has not been " big stuff . " A U.S. Navy-trained flier with the Leftists ' Army last year wrote that the Russians had the best ships , the Germans the best-trained pilots . No man can be sure , however , to what extent Germany , Russia and Italy sent examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
