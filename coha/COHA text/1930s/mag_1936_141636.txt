The appearance of a new Hamlet on the boards of an English-speaking theatre is traditionally the signal for drama critics to begin behaving like racehorse handicappers . For when an actor goes as Prince to Elsinore he invites comparison with the past performances of flashy favorites . Last week able John Gielgud appeared on Broadway in Guthrie McClintic 's Hamlet . True to tradition , play-reviewers threw down their programs , rushed to their form books to weigh Mr. Gielgud 's worth against every Hamlet from Barrymore , Forbes-Robertson and Irving to Booth and Burbadge . Consensus seemed to be that next month , when the reviewers sit in judgment on Leslie Howard 's portrayal of the gloomy Dane , the name of Gielgud will be added to the list of notable comparative Hamlets . <P> John Gielgud , a sensitive and intelligent Englishman of 32 with a nose the size of a hockey puck , was seen in the U. S. last spring as the hero of a not very exciting British film melodrama called Secret Agent . Long before that , however , London had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four separate productions between 1929 and 1936 . Many who witnessed the cast of his nighted colour in Manhattan last week had no difficulty in understanding Gielgud 's popularity in the role . The size of Actor Gielgud 's features , ludicrous when magnified on the screen , greatly assist him to project his range of expression into the depths of a legitimate playhouse . Majority in Manhattan audiences found his voice as melodious as it was cracked up to be , responded to his almost feminine delicacy of gesture , appreciated his youthful grace of movement ( Actor Gielgud says he will not play Hamlet after he reaches 35 ) . <P> Those who favored lustier interpretations of the part were frankly disappointed at Gielgud 's refusal or inability to scale the dramaturgic heights in the grand manner . Those who preferred the new school of low-key interpretation considered that Actor Gielgud admirably analyzed his own fluid impersonation of the world 's best-known literary case of frustration when in Scene II Hamlet informs the Queen : ' T is not alone my inky cloak . . . <P> Nor windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river in the eye . . . <P> That can denote me truly . . . <P> I have that within which passeth show . . . <P> To Producer McClintic goes the palm for 1936 Shakespearean innovation . He has represented the King 's ghost as a spooky silent presence whose voice croaks hollowly from an off-stage microphone . As the Queen , pneumatic Judith Anderson makes good theatrical sense . As wan and woebegone Ophelia , Lillian Gish is Lillian Gish . Jo Mielziner 's articulated Hamlet set caused the form-book perusers to recall a similarly successful one by Norman Bel Geddes for Raymond Massey in 1931.
