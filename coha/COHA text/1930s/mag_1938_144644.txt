University of Wisconsin as an institution has a long-standing liberal tradition . But not all Badgers are liberals . Month ago the conservatives on Madison 's Langdon St. ( Wisconsin 's swank fraternity row ) routed the liberals , elected their ticket* to the board of control of the undergraduate Daily Cardinal . Next day the new board ousted curly-haired Richard J. Davis , a New Yorker and no fraternity man , who had been elected executive editor by the retiring board to succeed New Yorker Morton Newman . The new board complained of Editor Davis ' Leftist leanings , said he could not work in harmony with the diverse groups producing the paper . But one member blurted : " We do n't want another Jewish editor . " Around the campus spread word , later denied , that two facultymen had seconded this view . <P> Thereupon half the Cardinal staff walked out and published an opposition paper called the Staff Daily . Some 2,500 students signed an unsuccessful petition for a referendum to recall the board of control . And last week white-haired , conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting president after Glenn Frank 's ouster last year , pushed the university into the national limelight again by charging that racial bigotry had reared its head on Wisconsin 's campus . Said he : " When an effort to put the Cardinal into the hands of a different group for next year is supported by an appeal to race prejudice , I am in arms . " <P> Wisconsin 's new president , big Clarence Addison Dykstra , facing his first major administrative crisis , quickly defined a liberal by acting like one . He declared himself neutral in the controversy , said the students " must settle their problem as a lesson in self-government . " He also hazarded the opinion that the dispute was political , not racial . Said he : " Doubtless in the heat of the Cardinal campaign some opposition to individual Jews has been expressed , but I feel sure that this opposition has not extended further than to specific individuals . I have found no anti-Semitic trend or temper in any of my conferences . . . . Because the last two elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has grown that they represent an eastern class-struggle point of view rather than the liberal Wisconsin tradition . " <P> At week 's end Wisconsin agreed to hold another student election this week to pick another board to pick another set of Cardinal editors . <P> *Including Dorothy Boettiger , daughter of President Roosevelt 's son-in-law , John Boettiger.
