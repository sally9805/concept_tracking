txt The National Steel Corp . has increased the price of hot rolled strip SZ a ton , the increase to go into effect immediately . This action probably will be followed by other important makers of sheet and strip steel in short order , and follows the upturns of $2 a ton announced Saturday on semi-finished and some heavy finished steel products for third quarter delivery by the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp .. subsidiary of U. S. Steel Corp . The process of marking up steel prices , now begun , comes as a result of disappointing earning results of the principal steel companies for most of this year , indicating conclusively the necessity of getting higher levels to offset sharply increased costs . Second Quarter Earnings Outlook Despite rising costs , the steel industry is expected for the second quarter to show an improvement in earnings over the first quarter of 1936 . However such prospective improvement in earnings is considered still far short of the gain which should be registered in view of the better rate of ingot production . In the first quarter of 1936 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $11,800.000 , an increase of roughly 46% over the unsatisfactory first quarter of 1935 . Ingot rate was nearly 9145 , higher in the 1936 period , the improvement in net profit position directly reflecting the advantage of lower operating cost made possible as a result of greater tonnage . Comparison for the two periods also shows that improvement was by no means uniform , the increase in aggregate profits being due primarily to substantial improvement shown in the first 1936 quarter over the year before by U. S. Steel , Bethlehem and Youngstown Sheet Tube . A number of companies showed lower net profits in the 1936 period than the year before . A Dow-Jones survey gives below the performance of 17 leaders in the industry for the first 1936 quarter and of 16 for the first 1935 quarter , for which Sharon Steel Hoop figures were not available . As a result of the pending advance in prices for finished steel products , it is expected the industry generally should now be better able to absorb the currently rising level of costs . So far as can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the possible exception of tin plate , pipe and wire products . In tin plate most of the contracts are made far ahead , in some instances for as much as a year . so that any upturn in this product will not .. come up for consideration until near the end of the year . $35,000,000 or More Extra Costs Advances in quotations for semi-finished and some heavy finished steel products as announced Saturday by Carnegie-Illinois , had been expected for third quarter delivery , due to the steadily mounting costs experienced by the steel producers since the beginning of this year . Latest developments to increase costs have been the granting of vacations with pay to mill workers , the new tax and social security legislation , which some authorities estimate between $35,000,000 and $45.000,000 additional expenses to the steel industry in a year . This is the first important advance in steel prices since July , 1934 . While the action of some makers in announcing prices with extras , as well as concessions on quantities last March , actually resulted in higher average selling levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilized , the quotations made at that time merely recognized what should have been the regular market before price slashing started . Others to Follow The fact that the lead in the advance was taken by the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp. , a U. S. Steel subsidiary , is considered significant . it is certain that all the other steel makers will follow the advance , in an effort to offset some of the increased costs . However , some days may elapse before all the announcements are made public . Announcement of the new third quarter prices at this time will permit many large consumers to estimate ahead on their - requiremenu ; and cover their needs at the old levels . At the same time it will allow those who may figure on business later on to take into consideration the higher levels which will prevail when the steel is finally taken . Interest from now on will center on the quotations of the lighter steels , notably sheets and strip , because of the anticipated heavy demand for these products late in the third quarter from the automotive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be brought out by early November at the latest . It is in this field that a mark-up is expected to be announced today . Quotations on these articles should be an , nounced by the companies which specialize in the lighter steels . In some quarters it is be , lieved that various advances are likely to be made in these products within a few days , although nothing official , confidential or other , wise , has been forthcoming on the matter as yet .
