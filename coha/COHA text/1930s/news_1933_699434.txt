txt Franklin D. Roosevelt , Presidentelect , will again discuss with Demo , cratic leaders of-Congress the party program , by the carrying through of which it had been hoped to avoid a special session , when he stops in Washington Thursday on his way Sauth . No general conference is 1,1anned , but he expects to see most of the party leaders separately during his stay in the capital . With partial failure of the program seeming almost certain , a special session of Congress soon after Mr. Roosevelt becomes President appears to be inevitable . Mr. Roosevelt , in his formulation of a party policy for the present short session of Congress , declared for three things : The enactment of a beer bill , balancing the Federal budget on the basis of the estimates of the Hoover administration and the enactment of farm relief legislation . How much of this program it will be possible to get through this session of Congress is likely to be made clear during Mr. Roosevelt 's talks with the party leaders at Washington . At present , the outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill apparently is to be amended in the Senate by changing the legalized alcoholic content from 3.2 by weight to 3.05 , but with the proposed tax of $5 fa barrel unchanged . The beer bill , even if agreement on a measure is reached by the Senate and House committees arid passed by both houses , faces the hazard of a Presidential veto without the likelihood of either overriding the veto as the House of Representatives overrode the President 's veto of the Philippine independence bill . Balancing of Budget Doubtful . Legislation that really will balance the budget appears unlikely at this session . The proposal to increase the normal income-tax rates to 6 and 12 per cent as a method of raising additional revenue to prevent the prospective deficit , upon which there was an agreement at a conference with the Presidentelect , has met with strong opposition from Democrats and appears to be dead for the present unless it is revived at the conferences this week . Governor Roosevelt has found satisfaction in the fact that he was able to get representatives of all the farm organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embodied in the so-called farm parity bill which was passed by the House , but which is reported to be faced by obstacles in the Senate which may prevent it from coming to a vote there at this session . Mr. Roosevelt all along has taken the position that he could not attempt to dictate to the present Congress , in which the Republicans have a normal Majority in the Senate and the Democrats a comparatively small majority in the House . So far , he has been content to define general policies and to leave the details of working out these policies to the party leaders . In the next Congress , both houses of which will be completely under Democratic control , Mr. Roosevelt , as President , will be faced with the responsibility of asserting his leadership to a greater degree than he so far has felt possible or desirable . There is every indication that he will do so and that he will call a special session to put through essential part. ; of his program to bring the country out of the economic depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next month , in addition to facing the important general problems he must meet immediately after his inauguration , Mr. Roosevelt must give thought to the selection of his Cabinet and ap- ' pointments to other Important posts . He will continue the inten-sive study of governmental problems which he has pursued since his retirement as Governor , which will be interrupted only by a short period of rest on his cruise on Vincent Astor 's yacht Nourmahal . Mr. Roosevelt , except for several hours with his mail , had a period of relaxation today and at night presided at the annual " birthday " party for newspaper men and others who accompanied him on his 1920 campaign trip when he was the nominee for Vice President . Since that campaign Mr. Roosevelt every year has invited this group to a dinner held as near his birthday as possible . Mr. Roosevelt 's birthday is on Jan. 30 , when he will be 51 years old . Those at the party tonight in , eluded men slated to become secretaries to the President , Colonel Louis Howe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirk Simpson , Laurie Jacobs , John Sullivan , Charles Mc ' Carthy , Stanley Prenosil , Miss Marguerite Dehand , personal secretary to Mr. Roosevelt ; Miss Malvina Thompson , secretary to Mrs. Roosevelt , and Miss Margaret A. Durand , secretary to Colonel Howe . As is customary at these dinners , there was a good deal of goodnatured bantering between Mr. Roosevelt and his guests . As one of the party described it , " it was open season for President-elects . " Senator-elect William G. of California will arrive at the Roosevelt home at Krum Elbow late tomorrow afternoon to remain overnight . Mr. Roosevelt will return to New York City Monday afternoon to resume his conferences there . He will leave Thursday for Washington , where he will remain that night . He then will go to Muscle Shoals , accompanied by Senators Norris , Hull . , Black and Bankhead , and will arrive Sunday morning at Warm Springs , Ga. , for a two weeks ' stay before leaving on his yachting cruise on Feb. 5.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
