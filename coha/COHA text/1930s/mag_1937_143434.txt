Representative Joseph Jefferson Mansfield of Columbus , Tex . is one of the two members of Congress who operate in wheel chairs. * A gentle , mild-mannered oldster of 76 , who has been paralyzed since 1921 , Congressman Mansfield created a furor in 1932 when he rolled himself down to the rostrum to sign a petition to discharge the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of a proposal to modify the 18th Amendment , and thus bring it to the floor . His was the 145th signature which the petition needed to become effective , a coincidence by which Congressman Mansfield professed to be greatly surprised . Last week , Congressman Mansfield surprised himself even more thoroughly by another coincidence of exactly the same kind . This time , the bill to whose rescue he raced on his wheel chair was the Fair Labor Standards Act , to provide for minimum wages and maximum hours in U. S. industry , item No. 2 on the President 's program for the current extra session . <P> The Wages &; Hours Bill has had hard sledding . Introduced in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it got through the Senate in July . In the Senate , the bill found stern opposition from Republicans like Michigan 's Arthur Vandenberg , who considered it a step on the road to " the centralized , authoritarian State " but in the House it never even had a chance to be denounced . House procedure empowers the Rules Committee to determine the order in which bills shall be considered , apportion time limits for general debate . Thus , by not giving a " rule " to bring a bill to the floor , the committee can effectively block action on any piece of legislation which its members do not favor . Since the Rules Committee is elected by the House and since the House contains an overwhelming Democratic majority , the present committee could usually be depended upon to put no obstacle in the way of Administration measures . Its highly abnormal behavior in the case of the Wages &; Hours Bill was the result of highly abnormal circumstances . <P> As passed by the Senate , what the Wages &; Hours Bill proposed was a five-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Senate , to set nationwide pay &; working standards in all U. S. industries affecting interstate commerce , except farming and industries already under Government regulation . The LSB was to set minimum wages up to 40 an hour , maximum hours down to 40 hours a week . Also included were strict child-labor limits . Infringement of the LSB rulings would be misdemeanors punishable by a $500 fine , six months in jail or both . Any such supervision over U. S. industry is naturally least acceptable to the South , whose industrial platform is that its climate and general living conditions diminish living costs and hence make equitable a lower wage rate than the North . Although the provisions of the bill were flexible enough to allow for regional differentials , such differentials might well be too small to suit Southerners . Of the Rules Committee 's 14 members , four are Republicans , five Southern Democrats . When the House Labor Committee turned the bill over to them last August , it soon became apparent that they had no intention of putting it on the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
