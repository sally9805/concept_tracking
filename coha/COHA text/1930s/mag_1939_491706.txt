M AX BAER peered through the smoky haze of Madison Square Garden , located his corner , and swung manfully toward it . Max could see from only one eye ; the other was closed as tightly as his fist , and under it bulged an ugly , purplish blob almost as big as the same fist . " Come on , Max , come on ! " shrilled a voice above the hubbub of the crowd . It belonged to Izzy Kline , Baer 's chief second , who had clambered up the ladder to the ring and awaited Max . As the former world heavyweight champion sagged to the stool in his corner , he managed a grin . But it was a weak attempt because the effort aggravated his hurt . Kline had a razor blade in one hand , a match in the other . He flashed the blade through the flame of the match several times . Ile reached over and slit the pulpy flesh under Maxie 's eye . Quickly , he leaned over and sucked on the open wound , spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again a second had saved the day for his man . That blood-letting won the fight for Baer . It enabled him to carry on through the last four rounds to outpoint Tommy Farr , who got rich by losing . If Kline had not punctured the blob , Farr 's punches would have burst it . The ensuing gory gushing would have forced the referee to halt the bout and award it to Farr on a technical knockout . And Baer 's days as a leading heavyweight probably would have ended then . Today he would not he in line for a title match . Seconds are the chorus men of the prize ring . Seldom mentioned in the ballyhoo , never credited in the records , seconds , nevertheless , have won more than their share of fights . Indeed , they have won championships by their adroit ministrations to wounds , their quick thinking , and their whispered advice .

Jack helps Joe with dressing gown after the easy victory over King Levinsky . Most of all , though , the second is there to protect his fighter much the same as did the duelist 's friend of old who stood in the early dawn to see that his pal was n't handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , too , must guard against trickery by the opposition , cheating by the officials . Fighters know that it is better to go into battle without your right hand than to try to fight without your right-hand man . Freddie Steele , for instance , has not been the same fighter since his manager and second , Dave Miller , died . In his first fight after Miller 's death , spectators were puzzled to see the former middleweight champion burst into tears as he walked to his corner at the end of the opening round . " I just could n't help it , " Steele explained later , unashamed . " I just could n't help crying when I looked at my corner and for the first time did n't see Dave 's face , or hear his encouraging voice . " Poor Primo Camera felt lost when he had to step into the ring to defend his world heavyweight title against Max Baer without the cool , confident Bill Duffy by his side . Mr. Duffy , at the time , was a , // guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about income taxes and could n't get away for the fight . Of course , it . is questionable whether even Mr. Duffy could have changed the outcome of that fight ; but if anything could have been done , Mr. Dully would have done it . Tony Galento , the uproarious tavern keeper who is variously known as the Newark Nightstick and " The Keg That Walks Like a Man , " has such a high regard for his manager and second , Joe Jacobs , that he loudly refused to go through with his fight with Nathan Mann last May when the New York Boxing Commission would n't lift its suspension of Jacobs . Tony did n't think he could win unless Joe was in , his corner , but he finally relented and went to war when the commission hedged a bit and gave Jacobs permission to sit in the working-press section beneath Galento 's corner . Jacobs ' influence with Galento is so great that when Kid Pneumonia floored the Blubber Man last summer , physicians called Yusell to the bedside to give his fighter an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had staggered back to the corner after a disastrous round . Speaking of Mr. Jacobs , those of you who have been reading about the Nazi persecutions , may be surprised at Schmeling 's connection with Jewish Mr. Jacobs , his American manager . The fact is , Max owes Joe all he has paid him and more , Jacobs won Mr. Brisbane shuddered and shouted louder , " That man was deliberately fouled ! " One of the tight judges thereupon pounded on the apron of the ring and shouted to Crowley , who was still trying to shake off Jacobs : " It was a foul , Crawley  --  a clear foul ! " So Crowley said to Jacobs , " Let go my arm  --  I ai n't counting him . I want to raise his hand I " Schmeling realizes that he would not have won the title on his beam-ends if Jacobs had not clung to Crowley 's ann . Brisbane would not have had time to cry his weighty opinion , the judge would not have had time to relay his near-command . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that he sent for him to he on the scene when he fought Steve Dudas in Nazi Germany last April . dl Twelue.Word Battle Cry I T 'S only natural that Schmeling especially ap- 1 preciutes the value of a good man in his corner . Not only was Jacobs considerably responsible for Max 's victory over Sharkey , he also had something to say in Schmeling 's sensational knockout of Joe Louis in their first meeting . His say consisted of twelve words , bitten off in the one-minute rest period between the first and second rounds . Max lurched back to his corner after a rocky first round and muttered : " Aeh , er kann schlagen ! " ( Oh-h-h , he can hit ! ) Jacobs squeezed Maxic 's arm , shook him , and screamed : " Yeah , Max , but you can punch , too  --  and he 's afraid of you I " These hoarse words had the same buoying effect as a friendly voice in the blackness of night . The fight forest is full of seconds . Nearly every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves or closes up his restaurant . But there are only a few good seconds . Strangely , a great fighter seldom becomes a capable second . , Jack Dempsey , for instance , was of no help to Max Baer the night that Maxie was knocked out by Joe Louis . He tried to tell Baer to fight Louis the way he would have fought the dusky Detroiter  --  and there was only one Jack Dempsey . The second must be licensed , the same as a fighter , manager , referee or judge . This license generally costs five dollars , is good for one year , and is recognized only by the state in which it is issued . Thus , a second from New York must obtain a Connecticut license to handle a fighter in Hartford . New York wo n't allow a father to second a son , or a brother to second a brother , because the history of family fighters is full of unhappy happenings . But outside of this ban on blood ties anybody except a felon can he a second . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title for Max one night  --  with the assistance of the late Arthur Brisbane . It happened in Schmeling 's first fight with Jack Sharkey . The Sailor Man was punching out what promised to bo a one-sided victory when suddenly Der Mox exploded that fearsome right of his against Sharkey 's head . Shaken and angered , Sharkey ripped into Max with both hands to the body . Max dropped to the canvas , clutching his abdomen and grimacing in agony . Instantly , Jacobs was in the ring . He grasped Referee Crowley 's arm . Crowley had waved Sharkey to a neutral corner and was starting to count over the fallen Schmeling , by now writhing in great . distress . But Crowley could n't count . He could n't lift his right arm . Jacobs was hanging onto it , and for dear life . At this point , enter Mr. Brisbane . He rose from his seat in the press row and cried , in a high , tremulous voice , " That man was fouled ! " Johnny Buckley , Sharkey 's manager , wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , you old fool , you ? " ( Contino  --  ri from Pose 15 ) A Dash of Psychology Jack Sharkey had to he bullied before a fight . Jack Delaney needed the same treatment . They had high-strung dispositions , fidgeted nervously before their battles , and feared the worst always . They were by no means yellow , but they suffered from acute attacks of imagination . Their seconds had to be careful that they did n't leave their fights in the dressing room . Delaney 's second would leave him alone until just before fight time . Then he would storm in with a great banging and slamming of doors and shout : " Come on , come on ! Hurry up ! We ai n't got much time . " He would yank Jack off the rubbing table , give him a shove out the door , and push hint all the way up to the ring . Jack would get so angry at the second for shoving him around that he would forgot all about the fight over which he had been worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burly Paul Berlenbach , the first time . Delaney fled before Paralyzing Paul 's punches throughout the first two rounds . At the end of the second , he staggered back to his corner and dropped onto the stool , exhausted . Ho could n't run any more . ' ' What , " he gasped ? " what itin I going to do now ? " Lenny , the man in his corner , shouted , " What 're you going to do ? What 're you going to do ? Well , you 're going lo do just what I told you to do back there in the dressing room and what I been telling you for thirty days  --  go out there and stand up and let him come to you , and when he does and he starts to hook with that left , just give him a straight right to the jaw . YOU ca n't miss  --  and they 'll have to serape him off the floor . " Delaney took a deep breath , walked to the center of the ring , met Berlenbach'a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was Paralyzing Paul who was paralyzed . Iron Hands In Myer &lovas; Lenny will assure you that no fighter is a coward . " You got to have courage to wear nothin ' but tights in public , ai n't you ' ? " Lenny remarks . One of the most important duties of the second is the bandaging of the lighter 's hands . The boxer 's fists are his tools , and unless they are ins proper shape he can not ply his trade . The second must know where to wrap the gauze and adhesive tape , so that the most vital spots are supported , at the same time being careful not to bandage the hand too tightly , or the fragile metacarpal bones in the back of the hand , which absorb the full shock of the blow , might be crushed or chipped . Pete Reilly , who had what seemed to be a ten-year leave on the world fen therweigh t etiampionship because three successive titleholders  --  Andra Rou Lis , Bat Batten no and Freddie Millerfo ugh t grader his guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No tighter of his ever lost a day 's work because of a damaged paw . While a second is bandaging his fighter 's hands , he sends an aide into the opponent 's quarters to watch the bandaging there . Happenings in the past have taught the boys to guard againat trickery , despite the fact that the boxing commission has an inspector in each dressing room to see that the fighter does n't forget to take off his high-schoul class ring . A favorite trick of the old-timers wits to lay strips of tinfoil in between each wrapping of gauze . The man 's fist , thus strengthened , became a veritable blackjack , lead-laden and lethal . Other seconds have been known to tape a matchstick across the knuckles  --  supposed to increase a man 's punching power tenfold . Others have sprinkled plaster of Paris over the bandages . Then they harden into a club within a round or two , when water doused on the fighter trickles down into the gloves . There are SIAmo figh t experts  --  among them Janice Joy Johnston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dempsey might have had some such hidden help that afterimon in Toledo when he bashed poor old Jess Vi illard 's jaw . Dempsey 's punches left brutal bruises on Willard 's body and messed up his race something fierce . Dempsey , however , does n't think the charges are worth denying and his way of answering any questions on the matter today is to laugh , shrug , and call the story absurd . To make eertani that nothing other than a hand goes into the gloves , the second always visits the opponent 's corner to inspect the mittens before they are laced on . He digs his hand deep into each glove IN it is taken front the box and hands it to the fighter  --  not to the opposing second , because seconds do n't trust each other . " I do n't let nobody else put his hand in tha I glove , once I 've examined it , " says Joe Jacobs . Some seconds try to break the glove -- that is , they bend the pillowy mitten hack and forth several times until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hones . " Jaek Britten Luld me to let ' em go a head and break the gloves , " says Dunn Dan Morgan , who used to manage and second the clever Britton . " Jack would say , Let ' ern do at , Dan  --  and I 'll just let him hit are here a couple of times . ' And Britton would tap his elbow  --  und , sum as shooting , he 'd give the guy the elbow , and the knuckles would either get broke Or bruised so bud that the fellow could n't hit arty more with that hand . " The tools of the second 's trade are a bottle of smelling salts ; u solution to stop the flow of blood from outs ; a handful  --  sometimes , for convenience , 21111thltlakil  --  of hild.le sticks with cotton tips for applying the solution ; a couple of ice bags , which , pressed against the fighter 's head between rounds , will keep down the swelling and lessen the danger of cuts ; a bottle of water , which sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it to clear the tighter 's throat ; and a towel , which the second has usually picked up in a Pullman or a hotel , and which , contrary to pop-Mar belief , he no longer is permitted to wave about as a fan  --  not because it might be recognized , but because boxing commissions do n't think it makes fur a pretty sight . Some seconds sniff at smelling salts . llarry Lenny , for one , prefers more natural recuperative means , and if his lighter is groggy , he holds the boy 's head down for thirty seconds or so . The rush of blood back to the head revives hint , " says Lenny . The handsome former middleweight contender , Georgie Ward , formed a great distaste for smelling salts when his second , clutching a bottle of salts in one hand and st bottle of water in the other , got the two mixed up in his excitement and dumped the water down Ward 's nose and the salts into his mouth . Ward liked to choke then and there ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundering second . Dutch Courage This flustered fellow was no worse than Izzy Kaplan , the rotund little New York photographer , who thought that he could manage and second a lighter . It was inevitable that ? izzy 's boy would take a beating , but when the time eamejzzywasn ' t up to it . As the battler staggered back to the corner lifter a torrid round , Izzy shook his head sadly and took sev-eral strong whiffs of salts and a large swig of wa-ter , the fighter slouching unattended on the stool . Pao of stimulants on a fighter is barred in New York , but in some states the second pours a shot of whisky or brandy down the fighter 's throat to give him energy in the late rounds . A rough , tough tighter around Philadel-phia some years ago used to consume a pint of whisky between the first and tenth rounds of his lights Once he had to box a fifteen-rounder and the second , afraid his man might get drunk , put the whisky away and gave him vinegar instead through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Boy-o-boy , hat that 's the best rye I ever did taste . " Joe Galls had to starve himself for two days before his tight with Battling Nelson at Goldfield , so that he could make the stipulated weight of 133 pounds at . ringside . To regain his lost strength , the game little guy sucked on a bottle of beef juice and brandy . That 's why he weighed more when the fight was over than when it started . For treating cuts , the old-time seconds swore by cobwebs . An hour before the fight you would find them groping down in the basement of near-by buildings , gathering the fuzzy stuff from the beams . " Nothing better than cobwebs , " says old Charley Harvey , who has been seconding fighters since John L. Sullivan . " A pinch of them would hold a dam . " Today 's second , however , will use adrenalin , collodion or some other solution  --  each serving the purpose of drawing the split flesh together . Doc Bagley , is studious , gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene Tunney , is considered the best cutman among the seconds and will usually be found in the corner of any fighter who bleeds easily . Doc , they city , is the one who first thought of sucking the blood from a bruise , so that it would not burst . His value as a eutman was proved the night that Farr fought Jimmy Braddock . Farr , an old booth fighter with plenty of old wounds , cuts quickly . But he did n't shed a drop of blood throughout the Braddock fight , because Bagley kept closing the wounds as quickly as they were opened . If Doc had been in Fares corner when Tommy met Joe Louis for the title , it is possible that the Welshman might have won . Farr bled throughout that fight and , unquestionably , the open wounds bothered him . At the end of each round , Tommy would come bark to his corner with crimson rivulets trickling from a half dozen cuts above and below his eyes . He would stand in his corner for ten to fifteen seconds wearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tend to his hurts . Job Churchill , chief second , had a wooden leg . Yet he insisted on the honor of being the first man up to the ring . Physically handicapped as he was , it took the poor old Fellow an unusually long time to hobble up the ladder , with the rest of the seconds trailing along behind . When Heckling Won a Title Under the rules of most boxing commissions , the second can not shout instructions to his fighter during rounds . Nor is he supposed to bait the other fighter . However , the boys have been known to do both . Some of them have stolen Al Herford 's idea for relaying instructions . Herford , manager and chief second of Joe Gans , would bounce a wooden ball on the edge of the ring whenever he wanted to tell Joe something during the course of the battle . One bounce meant jab , two bounces meant hook , and so forth  --  all according to a prearranged system of telegraphic signals . As for baiting the other fighter , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising June evening three years ago when James J. Braddock outpointed the champion . Gould , one of the best jockeys in the business , had won a lien on Biter 's goat at the weighing-in , and with his sneers and smirks when the gloves wore being adjusted . But he was comparatively quiet until Baer landed a terrific punch on the side of Braddock 's head after the : bell rang ending the fifth round , Gould jumped to the ring and ran along the apron shouting and cursing at Baer . All the way around to Baer 's corner Gould ran , screaming : " You yellow bum , you yellow burn l Wait 'll Jim gets you this round  --  and if he do n't I will ! " Even after he was led back forcibly to Braddoek 's corner by strong-armed hirelings of the commission , Gould continued to heckle Max , There are some who believe his jabbering had as muchto do with Baer 's defeat as did Jim 's jabbing . Frequently , seconds are unjustly abused by fans when a boxer is badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , stop it , " the fans clamor , damning the cruelty of the seconds for not throwing in the towel . But a second ca n't stop a fight  --  the referee alone has this authority . This has been the law ever since some of the boys suffered a profitable attack of defeatism a few years back , and started betting on their fighters to lose . If the involuntary tanker got too far in front , it was a simple matter for his second to throw in the towel , conceding defeat when victory was at hand . The average second is not the heart , less hombre he has been pictured by the movie script writers . This statement recalls perhaps the best , if the oldest , story that is told about the refusal of seconds to be intimidated by their fighter 's opponent . They 're telling it now about Barney Ross , as the result of the Armstrong annihilation . Losing the Hard Way The story goes that between each round Ross ' seconds screamed into his ears , " He ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't laid a glove on yuh , kid . He ai n't laid a glove on yuh , kid , " for a full sixty seconds . As time and Armstrong wore on , the weary Ross finally turned to his retinue of well-wishers and replied : Okay , boys , okay . But will you please watch that . referee this time out ? Somebody in there is hittin ' me . " Of course it did n't happen , but they revive the classic every time a boy takes a real shellueldng in a big fight . Actually , most seconds are just as solicitous of their man 's safety as Art Winch and Sam Pian , co-managers and seconds of Barney Ross , were in his battle with the colored cyclone from St. Louis . Far from telling Barney " He ai n't laid a glove on yuh , kid , " Winch and Pian were in there begging Barney to surrender to Homicidal Henry . And they meant it . They bad watched Barney grow up from a hungry little amateur to champion of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on him . They did n't want to see him permanently hurt . " Please , Barney , " they pleaded , " please let us ask the referee to stop it . You 've taken enough punishment . " But Barney would shake his head and mutter , " I 'm losing the title , and I want to lose it the hard way . " Spider Kelly , considered the greatest second the Pacific Coast ever saw , once wrecked a betting coup arranged by the boys in the opposing corner because he could n't stand to see his fighter take any more punches . He was seconding Frankie Neil , former bantamweight champion , in a bout with Abe Attell , then the featherweight king . Frankie was near the end of his fighting days arid Attell was an overwhelming favorite , not only to outpoint him but to knock him out . However , Abie and the boys , following a delightful custom of theirs , were wagering that Frankie would go the distance . So whenever Neil staggered under Attell 's smashes , Abe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , waltzing him around until his head had cleared . But Attell blasted and waltzed Neil once too often . Kelly decided his tighter was hopelessly beaten and tossed in the towel . Attell and his pals lost thousands . Of course not all seconds are so considerate . Tiger Jack Fox , contender for the light-heavyweight championship , likes to tell the story of the second in his home town of Spokane , Washington , who feels so kindly toward his fighters that , without a qualm , he would send them stalking out against R. machine-gun nest . One night this second was handling a pale young man who was taking a pitiless pounding . In the first round , the kid had his right eyebrow half torn away by a booming punch . " Your round , kid , by a mile ; you 're off to a good start , " said the second . In the next round , the kid had his nose broken . " You 're boxing rings around him , kid , " said the second when the boy wobbled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're at .. That 's two straight rounds you win so far . " In the third round , the kid almost lost his left ear when he walked into a barrage . " You 've got him , kid ; he 's groggy , " said the second , as the kid Hopped onto the stool . " Keep it up . You 're way ahead . " With that. , the fighter rose from the stool , ducked through the ropes and started up the aisle to the dressing room . " Hey , where 're you going ? " screamed the second , running after him . " I 'm quitting , " said the fighter , " while I 'm still ahead . " Jack Kearns , one of the most able handlers of fighters , is not , of course , in the same class as the Spokane second . But he can be deaf to the drumming of fists on his fighter 's frame when the mood strikes him . Kearns , who managed and seconded Jack Dempsey and Mickey Walker , will fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the young man has failed to train for the bout. , Kearns seems to enjoy seeing retribution overtake the athlete . Saved by the Bell There was the time that Walker neglected to train for his scuffle with a husky named Bearcat Wright , and took a lusty lambasting . But as he would stumble back to the corner at the end of each round , bloody and exhausted , Kearns would slap him in the face and snarl , " What 's the matter with you ? You been boasting how you can fight with your belly full of beer . Well , ai n't it ? And why ai n't you fighting ? " Another time , however , Walker , in the same condition , was saved by Kearns . It happened in Louisville . Walker was scheduled to fight on the eve of Derby Day , but the bout was called off at noon when his opponent was taken ill . Mickey went out to mingle with the thirsty Derby crowds , but while he was helping them empty the tubs at the local pubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kearns rushed from bar to bar , finally found Walker , and led him to the arena . The Mick was hardly fit to fight , but Kearns decided to risk going through . The substitute opponent , Paul Swiderski , sank his first punch up to the elbow in Mickey 's inflated tummy . Mickey went oomph ! ? and down . He was floored six times that inning . Five " Yours and who else 's ? " said 14 's foreman , pocketing his quid . " Git out of our way . " Rock Doyle spat into his cupped fists . Young Ames , looking at the gathering crew of the Bowery engine , felt a times he managed to drag himself to his I wobbly feet . but the sixth time  --  well , when the referee bawled out " seven , " Mickey 's body merely heaved and quivered . The count was eight when Kearns , clutching a water bottle , reached over and hanged the timekeeper 's bell , with almost a minute still remaining to the round . Kearns jumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began working furiously over him as Swiderski 's seconds , the police , and some fans swarmed into the battle pit and staged an old-fashioned free-for-all . During it all , Kearns labored over his Mickey . After the brawl was over and the dust had cleared , so had Mickey 's head and tummy . He went on to win a newspaper decision over Swiderski . Staging a Comeback Teddy Hayes , who also was in Walker 's corner that night , was not above pulling a few tricks himself . Shortly after retiring from the seconding profession , Hayes turned author and revealed how he helped Benny Leonard when the former lightweight champion . now a paunchy businessman , attempted a lamented comeback a few years ago . ? Qne of Hayes ' stand-bys was to powder a towel with rosin dust and then rub Leonard 's gloves with the towel be-twee n rounds . The rosin particles would cling to the gloves and burn the other fellow 's body , leaving red welts whenever and wherever Leonard 's comparatively tame taps landed . At . the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opponent 's punches would slide harmlessly off the blubbery Benneh 's frame . To the spectators  --  an d , more important , to the judges  --  it II looked as though Leonard was pounding his opponent brutally and not being hurt at all himself . Clever , eh , these seconds ? Watch them at the next fight ; watch them , crouched beneath the corner , bobbing and weaving and wincing with the flurries of gloves above ; watch them scramble up the ladder and bustle about the battler as he comes back ; watch them treat his hurts with the skill of a physician , the tenderness of a parent ; watch them give a last-second , warm word of encouragement , a final pat . on the back when the ten-second buzzer " Seconds Out ! " ? crackles through the arena ; watch them registering anguish at defeat , delight at victory .
