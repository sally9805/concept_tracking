Would it work , this arrangement , if she accepted it ? Had Sally been right , and would anything Alec did from now on  --  at the hospital under Charles  --  work ? " Do n't you think , " Jane asked austerely , " that you might refer this matter to your wife ? I never saw such a determined sun-treader of a husband ! You ought to shake him out of his stride , Sally ! And kindly remember that I 'm not your wife ! You certainly wo n't get me to agree to such an absurd piece of conjuring . It 's going to be a little too much to bear , if both you and the new Superintendent think that women have n't got minds , and that you must make mine up for me ! Why should n't I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any bones being broken . " " You need n't make a blasted doormat of yourself , Jane , even if you are a woman , " Alec reminded her . " She 's trying to do the dirty on me , Sally , by iull:ing a bloody sacrifice of herself ! You know what I felt about your giving me your share of the cream on our honeymoon ! It 's enough to cause a divorce  --  a put-ti 1a job like that ! Now here 's Jane trying to pour her cream all over me as well ! You have n't the excuse of a bridal passion either , Jane , so put that in your pipe and smoke it ! " Jane leaned back in her chair and smiled . " What all this amounts to , Sally , " she said , " when you strip it clear of agreeable rhetoric , is that I prefer that Alec , who is my senior by two years , should remain my senior . What he is suggesting is that I should climb over his head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly know which treatment is the more humiliating , to be ordered by the new Superintendent to give up the male side because of my sex , or to be ordered by Alec to take what is consideredto be the senior M.O .

But it appears to me that both these gentlemen are a little out of date . I do n't know what you think about it , Sally . " Sally pressed her curls against Alec 's head . She took for granted , Jane saw , that only Alec could really be a judge of anything  --  except perhaps himself . " What is Jane to do ? " she murmured into his ear . " Her plain duty , " said Alec with decision . " What she 's trying to do now is to get round me by pretending that I 'm being unfair to her . I dare say she tried the same trick first on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you work with me , Jane ! I told him so just now . I said , I may resign anyhow , but unless Jane gets the women 's side , with the option of my taking the men 's , I 'll resign on the spot ! ' " " I hope you did n't say Jane , ' " Jane said , frowning ; " it sounds so undignified . What did Dr. Drummond answer ? " " Of course I did n't say Jane ' to him , " Alec replied hotly , " I said my colleague Dr. Everest , ' as stiff as any poker ; and he said : I hope very much that you wo n't resign . Perhaps you will have the kindness to discuss the other solution with her  --  and let me have both your decisionsto-morrow .

" and that did n't amuse Jane very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane said coldly . " I hope none of us are going to be driven into it . If you persist in your suggestion , Alec , I may be driven ! I am almost certain of a senior job in another hospital , since , if I resign , it will be because the Superintendent dislikes women doctors. 42 1 ' ' 1Z1VeATe WOLDS'l'liis is a creditable reason for a change , and Luke , who has a good deal of influence , could work it for me . If we exchange sides , you deliberately sink your prestige . You can not expect me to put up with that . Nor , in the long run , do I think you and Sally would like your having done it ! " Sally suddenly , and most surprisingly , said : " Oh , nonsense , Jane ! This is just your pride , and has n't any sense in it . You 've often told me that both sides were really equal , and quite independent . We are n't children , to mind who comes first . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take what he 's got for you . That 'll help him more than anything not to resign . And if Jane will take it , you 'll not resign  --  is n't that good enough , Alec ? " " Bless the girl ! " said Alec admiringly , " I 'm damned if she has n't got us both in a cleft stick ! Come on , Jane , shake hands on it . I 'm game if you are  --  and we 'll drink to the sudden death of the new Superintendent . Get out what I left of the whisky last night ! " Jane got it out , and gave Alec a drink , but she did n't take any herself . She did n't want the new Superintendent to die , and she felt strangely dissatisfied with having to let Sally decide for them all . She saw the sense of Sally 's decision . She saw that it had been her own pride which was sticking in her throat . Alec would feel better about settling down under the new Superintendent now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she going to mind because she had to take  --  instead of to give ? Was she to hanker after a beau geste as if life were a game in which you had to win moral approbation as a prize ? And what would Charles think of her ? Would he know that she had done this to save Alec from resigning , or would he think that Jane had given up the rights of a generous friend to come off best herself ? CHAPTER VJANE put out the light and laid her head down on the pillow ; but she suspected that this sane ritual would not be of much use to her . She was ferociously awake . First the hospital and its duties rose up before her . She could deal easily with them  --  what problems she had n't solved to-day could be solved to-morrow ; or they must be left to destiny helped out by common-sense . The fluttered curiosities of the staff were less easy to dismiss . They beat again and again against her tired brain . The Matron 's studied rudeness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of being pleased at the new appointment and not pleased at the same time !  --  All that housemaid 's drivel about Charles 's looks  --  they had known better than to let it out to Jane , but she had seen it in their excited eyes ! Her heart hammered sullenly on . Alec and Sally rose up before her , reconstructing their destinies and her own . There was that little episode of Sally 's arranging the flowers ; and minding ! How careful Jane would have to be , if Sally was going to start minding ; and how wholly careless Alec would always be , whether Sally minded or not ! A brilliant psychiatrist in his career , and a bull in a china shop where his own heart was concerned ! Then all the figures got mixed up together , without Jane 's being in the least more sleepy . She found herself looking into the pit of living . Thirty-one years stretched before Jane 's eyes , turning in the dark , like falling snowflakes , without direction or purpose , towards oblivion. 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister had been good to her ; and she had four hundred a year of her own . She went on working at the hospital where she had started training . She had made up her mind that the only way of keeping Bertram alive was to do what he would have expected of her . Her feeling for her eldest brother had never been a complete subjugation , but it had come perilously near it . If he thought Jane in the wrong , there was no reprieve ; if he thought her in the right , there was nothing left which could daunt her ! About Bertram Jane might be said never to think at all . You did not think of breathing . To-night his image stood clear before her eyes , although he would not speak ! Jane wanted him to tell her how she was going to stand by her friend Alec , and help him to keep impersonally true to his work , if her own heart played truant and left impersonal truth behind it . She wanted Bertram to tell her what she must think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The darkness grew as hideous to Jane as a grave . " I 've been in love once ! " she said fiercely into the pillow . " Ah , God not again ! " The images and even her thoughts left her . She found herself once more alone with her dead lover . He must be shot at dawn  --  shot for running away ! She had known nothing of it till it was all over . Space and time had run through her heart implacably , without a hint of warning ! She had waked up to find him gone . She had learned not to mind his running away ; but what she minded still was that she could n't explain to him why she did n't mind it , and with his head against her breast , free him from his bewildered shame , into a death fit for their shared pride ! Only her childhood continued to stand out as clear as day ; like part of a landscape left out of a storm . There was her father , who had the gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost subsidiary , life of the soul . He was a man of indomitable physical courage , which all his children shared . It would have been inconceivable to any of them to funk anything . He killed rabbits remarkably well , Jane remembered ; and had taught her how to do the same . Still that was n't what had made her want to be a doctor . The life of her mind had come later . It was her mother who had decided that Jane should have a profession like her brothers . No one in the family had agreed with her ; but as her mother had a small private income , she had carried out her newfanglednotion , and Jane had been trained for the career of her passionate choice . She had been able to feel almost like her brothers . She could ride , hunt , climb , fence , swim , as well as they could ; but she had not been allowed to die with them . The youngest was three years older than Jane . He had been killed that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned in a submarine . Bertram , the eldest , the core of Jane 's young heart , had been blown off the hard surface of the earth . Her parents had not long survived his death . After a year or two of broken life they too vanished . Their place went to a distant cousin , who had cut down their Gothic beeches , drained the small lake and started a market garden on the silvery smooth green lawns . Jane had n't had to go back there ; and she very seldom thought of it , except if she saw foxgloves standing out of a hedge ! There was nothing to make a fuss about . She was young and strong , and better off than most people whose House of Being had been overturned by the same hurricane . Her46 PRIVATE WO1WLDSBertram had trusted her enough to send her Michael 's last letter . He had known that she had a right to it , and that not to have had what Michael thought in her own mind , as well as in Michael 's dying mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , as people say , by heart . Some- times in desperate emergencies  --  during critical opera- tions or at lonely death-beds  --  the words ran clear as if she were reading them off a tape . " This is the best thing that could happen to me now . I 'm glad -- and not glad of it ! I ca n't want to see your eyes again ; but I ca n't want to die without having kissed you ! That 's silly , because the whole thing 's silly ! I do n't know why I ran away . I 'd been in tighter places and had n't ! The other fellows said not to tell you  --  they 'd all say I died awfully well , and all that ; but Bertram said , " Fell her the truth  --  she 's worth it . ' So I 'm trying to  --  only there is n't any . They got Martin  --  and then the trench crumpled up  --  and we ran . I was in command , and I think I kept saying we must n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertram 's been awfully decent to me . I wo n't tell my people . You 'll do what you think best about that  --  and about everything . Knowing that 's something ! I ca n't believe you 'll always be ashamed of me . Do you remember " He 'd stopped there . Perhaps it was the Dawn which had stopped him . Perhaps he had thought he ought n't to ask her to remember . Perhaps he knew that she would al- ways remember everything . Jane buried her head deeper into her pillow , to make the darkness swallow his young beauty ; and then , in- stead of Michael 's face , she saw Charles 's sterner , older fL . IVe1TE ' WOL17 . S 47Charles must have been through a few months of the War himself . He had in his steady eyes the look of a man who has lost all his securities , except one . Charles could n't have run away . CHAPTER VI WHEN Jane woke , after a short uneasy night , she had an instinctive feeling that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was the challenge of Charles 's faintly disgusted eyes . Then she remembered Alec 's anger . She could n't do anything about either Charles 's eyes or Alec 's anger . She would have to put up with both of them , and neutralise their activities by being as pleasantly passive as if she had n't noticed them . She was late getting down to breakfast . Dr. Barnes and Dr. Harding , the two junior medical officers , were already at the breakfast table . This deepened Jane 's sense of dis- couragement . She liked to get down early and have her breakfast alone . Neither of the two men rose when Jane entered the room . Both growled into teacups . Dr. Barnes 's growl was one of affection . He had a dumb tenderness for Jane , and Jane , if she had to have tender- ness from men at all , liked it to be dumb ; but this morning even Dr. Barnes 's solicitous silence annoyed her . She did n't want to hear him speak , and she greatly resented his look- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed Jane even more , because she saw that he meant to be nasty . He was a vain young man , with a great many cheap attractions ; and he could n't understand a woman who did n't notice them , or , if she were forced to notice them , was not attracted . He had offered with alacrity to serve under Jane , knowing that he could get the better of most women , only to discover that Jane was impossible to bluff and danger- ous to defy . If as much as a hair went wrong , or an order 1RIVTE WOL'DS 49miscarried , Jane had to know why , and Dr. Harding had had to tell her why . Every nerve of his masculine vanity had been stung by his three months ' enforced subordination . He could n't look at Jane without wanting to hit her . Dr. Barnes had shrunk from working under a woman at all , but when his turn came , he had found that whatever differences there were took the form of improvements . Jane subtilely heartened his diffidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make light of his blunders . Dr. Barnes wanted to die for Jane , even at the breakfast table . Being hindered from presenting her with this ultimate proof of his ardour , he had kept her toast warm by clappingit between the folds of his napkin . " Thank you , I never eat toast , " Jane said acidly , and opened her newspaper . Dr. Barnes , like an ingratiating dog trembling with eagerness to be noticed , flung his favourite bone at her feet . He told her the result of the Test Match between England and Australia . Jane made a faint sound that might have passed for acknowledgment . She had never felt less interest in how her fellow-countrymen played cricket . Dr. Harding said airily : " Well  --  ! I do n't know if you two have made up your minds yet about the new Superintendent , but personally  --  I do n't mind saying that I have no use for him whatever ! " Jane 's eyes flickered dangerously over the folds of her newspaper . " One wonders , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , what use has the new Superintendent for you ! " Appalled at this sudden descent into acrimonious personalities , she wished that she had bitten her tongue out rather than spoken . Never before had she given Dr.4L . So 1 1ZIV,4Te WOW.LDSHarding such an opening . His small moustache bristled with eagerness to take it . He shot an impudent glance at Jane . " I hear the new man is n't any too fond of women colleagues , " he said insolently ; " that will be a change for some of us ! Macgregor will have to mind his p 's and q 's , and not expect to have his chestnuts pulled out of the fire for him ! " " Macgregor 's grand ! " Dr. Barnes sharply  --  far too sharply  --  intervened . " He may be a little on the unconventionalside , but we 'd all have been proud to work under him . Would n't we , Dr. Everest ? " Jane had to say " Yes , " but she said it as if she were parting with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow . " Well  --  we wanted fresh blood , " Dr. Harding said with a derisive grin , " or I did , anyhow . I know you two always went hand-in-glove with him , but I 'm bound to say I 'd rather have even Macgregor than this fellow ! He looks as if all he had in his veins was a little iced tea ! " Jane , with a valiant effort , recovered her passivity . She looked as if she thought it did n't matter what either of the two young men thought about anything . She poured herself out a cup of coffee , drank it , and got up to leave the room . " You 've eaten no breakfast ! " Dr. Barnes pathetically whimpered . Jane let him whimper , and , opening the door , which neither of them had dreamed of opening for her , left the room . She wondered , as she slipped out into the corridor , why she should notice a lack of manners , for the first time for years . Halfway to the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Matron , barring her way. 1 W.IVeATC WORLDS S " Good-morning , Doctor ! " said the Matron , drawing a deep breath as if to say that there was going to be a good deal more to it than that . " Well  --  I suppose you 've alreadyseen the new Superintendent ? He 's young  --  and of course one is n't used to them like that ! I should say myselfthat he 'd make no impression on the patients whatever , except the bad females , and they 'd better be kept in the background , for a bad girl is a bad girl , call her mental or call her moral , and they always break out at the same spot ! Although I dare say it 's not my business to remind you of it ! Dr. Drummond wo n't have Dr. Macgregor'sway with the staff , that 's quite certain ! But he does n't look like one that will have favourites , which is always something ! I hear he thinks women doctors quite a mistake , but I dare say you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! You had your interview with him yesterday , I take it ; and poor Dr. Macgregor too ! But it 's no use quarrelling with your bread and butter , is it ? I did hear that you might be going to leave us ! But then ! I never pay any attention to second-hand reports ! " The Matron paused . Jane 's cool grey eyes met hers , and rested upon her speculatively , as if the Matron were a train which she did n't have to catch . " I think that very wise , " she said with a faint lift of her arched eyebrows . The Matron , defrauded of her deepest hope , fell back swiftly on her second line of attack . " Dr. Drummond , " she went on brusquely , " is what I call a dark horse . He may turn out to be a blessing in disguise , if you know what I mean ; or then again we may find him one of those you ca n't do anything with ! " Jane guessed that the Matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on with men whom she could either bully or flatter . No doubt she had tried flat-52 1 1IVeA  --  WOLDStery upon Charles ; but she had n't been able to find out if he were vulnerable or not . Because Charles 's manner was cold , the Matron would have thought him shy . You had , Jane thought , to be a trifle like Charles yourself , to realise how deeply he could evade the remotest human contact with a woman like the Matron , far too deeply for her to realise that he was evading it . As the Matron once more paused to lure her adversary out into the open , Jane looked at her watch . " How fortunate it is for us both , " she said , " that the question of how the new Superintendent will turn out is none of our business ! " Before the Matron had time to gather her forces togetherto reply , Jane slipped past her ; but she was not elated by her verbal victory . It was the second time that morning she had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was a curiously sordid and ignoble day . The patients were more than usually fractious . The nurses showed no tact . Everyone felt on edge , aware of changes which might affect them , and of futures which might be curtailed . Jane had to run the gantlet of continuous curiosity , sometimes veiled and sometimes unveiled . Even her work went less well than usual . The Arab obviously meant to die without affording a medical excuse for it . " One really does n't want a death just now ! " the ward sister complained to Jane with deep self-pity . " It does n't look any too well to a new Superintendent , to have patientsdying the moment he arrives ! I always have said that black men are the most inconsiderate of all our patients ! " Just as Jane had finished with the wards and was about to make her morning reports to the new Superintendent , 1 1RIVeATE WOL11S 53a new male patient arrived and refused to enter the hospital . Jane loathed putting pressure upon an adverse will ; but since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , there was no evading her responsibility . Getting a fractiousnew male patient in was just the kind of thing that Charles would expect a man to do better than a woman ! Charles 's office overlooked the drive , and it was more than a possibility that Jane would have his critical eyes upon her efforts . From a big stationary car in front of the main entrancean arm waved frantically . Jane ran down the steps towards the car . " I do n't want  --  ! I do n't want to go in ! " a distracted voice protested . It was a dull grey morning ; dry leaves hissed and rattledover the gravel drive . The big stone hospital stood , massive and forbidding , under a lowering sky . Jane laid her hand upon the window of the car . " It 's nearly lunch time , " she said in a friendly voice . " Wo n't you get out of the car by yourself  --  and see what it 's like ? " She motioned to the attendants to leave the patient alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man 's resistance by hurrying him , or even by noticing that he had any resistance . Her manner was that of a diffident hostess welcoming an honoured guest . The wind ruffled her soft , nut-coloured hair and long white linen coat . The two attendants in the car watched her uneasily . Maclean stood behind the open door , in case of trouble ; but Jane did not anticipate trouble , and she had forgottenCharles . Her whole mind was concentrated now on54 1 IVeAT E WOlZL1S serving this distraught , unhappy boy , with his fixed grudge against life . For a moment or two the big hulking young man looked as if he meant to go on fighting ; but finding no direct challenge to his strength , he got out instead , and looked confusedly about him . Jane 's mind ran over the points of the case , which she had just received by telephone . The young man was in an acute stage of dementia prwcox . He was the badly pampered only child of a widowed mother . During his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snatched or stolen his pleasures . When his mother died , no one cared about him any more . He came to an end of her money ; and after a brief struggle and a short term of imprisonment , he had found the world too uninviting a place , and gone out of his mind altogether . Poor little mouse , brought up in a trap stocked with cheese , no wonder he turned fierce , now that there was nothing for his teeth to meet on but the bars ! The young man made a threatening movement towards Jane . " Is n't this a mad-house ? " he demanded furiously . " I wo n't go inside ! I tell you I wo n't ! They sha n't make me ! " Her eyes smiled at him without pressure . " No one shall make you , " she said gently . " No one can , if you will come with me of your own free will . This is a hospital , and you are not well . We will do our best to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well enough , you can go wherever you like ! " The cold wind slapped at them , a dash of rain spattered big drops over Jane 's hair . She took no notice ; but she felt how cold , how wasteful , and how lonely life itself was for this trapped and desperate boy ! She showed him no pity , but the quiet friendliness of her manner relieved the worst of his tension. 1 1ZIVeAT  --  WOLDS SS " They wo n't touch me ! " he muttered . " You wo n't let any of them touch me ! " She saw that he wanted to be reassured that at least his physical manhood was his own . " If you will come with me , no one shall touch you , " Jane said firmly . Once more be looked about him , with stunned , bewilderedeyes . In his face was such a sick distaste for life that had there been any means handy to end it , he might have taken them . He looked at the world about him as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane slowly and suspiciously into the hall of the hospital . This , too , his haunted eyes seemed to say , might containan enemy ! But Jane herself was too neutral to rouse his hostile fears . He went with her , through the hospital and into the ward for new admissions as a leaf follows the path of an invisible wind . CHAPTER VIIWHEN Jane entered the Superintendent 's office , Charles stood with his back to her , looking out of the window which overhung the drive . Alec sat glowering over the reports spread out on the table . " You 're late ! " he said grudgingly . " I 'm sorry , " Jane explained breathlessly . " I had to receive a new patient . " Charles turned round . " Did you get the fellow in all right ? " he asked her in a manner that was nearly human . Jane nodded . She sat down opposite Alec and wanted to smile at him , but finding Charles 's eyes on them , she suppressed her friendliness . " Dr. Drummond knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished that Alec had n't said " our decision . " There had been two decisions . One was Alec 's and one was hers . They should have been kept separate . Charles murmured politely , " The hospital is to be congratulatedon retaining both your services . " Alec snorted . He hated politeness , and if there was one form of politeness which he hated more than another , it was impersonal politeness . The blood beat in Jane 's ears . She looked down at her report and waited . There was a long , torturing silence . Charles broke it at last by saying , " May I have your report , Dr. Ever-est ? " 1 IVeAT E WO LDS 57It was , of course , what they were there for , but it was hard for them not to remember how different it used to be with old Luke twinkling away at them , Alec dramatically leading a conversation full of pungent phrases and acute observations , while Jane , amused and at her ease , watched the work expand before them without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelter of his desk , erect and formal . His face was quite expressionless , and he seemed to have discovered a way of being there , and not there , at the same time . Still Jane had a suspicion that the new Superintendent was the most nervous of the three . She started reading her report , uneasily conscious that there were things she might have put better . She disliked the sound of her own voice and was startled at the difficultyshe found in reading her own handwriting . She felt as if nothing would ever be comfortable again . Still it did not matter , Jane told herself , comfort and ease were not what they were there for . Charles did not interrupt her by a single remark . When Jane had finished , he asked her a few questions , to which she had only to reply , " Yes , sir , " or " No , sir . " She felt as if by some mysterious sleight-of-hand , she and Alec had been changed overnight from high officials full of responsibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wholly Charles 's fault , in spite of his grand manner ; it must have been rather hard for him to feel so irretrievably unwelcome . He did not look at Jane , even whilst he was questioning her on her report , but perhaps he might have liked to be more human , if Alec had not sat , clenched to the table , determined to let nothing out of himself except antagonism . When both their reports were over and had received Charles 's comments , he opened what perhaps he had58 1 , IV A'FE WORLDSmeant for a discussion on the patients ' diet . He was evidentlydeeply interested in bio-chemistry and relied on it as one of the curative agents in mental diseases . Vitamin B was a point , Jane thought , that they might all have agreed upon . As Alec would not say anything at all , Jane felt that it would have been an act of disloyalty on her part to say very much . Still she went so far as to murmur a faint agreement . She did think it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food while limiting its quantity . Overloading the body could hardly be a short cut to improving the mind . " What do you think Dr. Macgregor ? " Charles insisted . Jane feared the look of reckless mischief which sprang into Alec 's hot brown eyes . " Well , " he said grimly , " if you ask me , I have always noticed that gelded cats , not having any pleasure except their stomachs , eat enormously , and , as mindless people are more or less on the same basis , I should not grudge them fairly hefty meals . In my opinion most of the patients have no palates . The senses are always less acute when the nervous system is deranged . Of course they get constipated , but how much of that is due to bulk and starch , and how much is a protestagainst control , I have never made up my mind . Grodeckconsiders constipation is entirely due to habits of parsimony , and there may be something in it ! Patients , after all , do n't have much they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all surprising if they want to hold on to their own insides ! " Jane could have shaken Alec . She saw that he was being fantastic , and off the point , entirely to annoy Charles ; but he was also letting down the seriousness of their profession . This was not the time  --  in the middle of a hard morning 's work  --  to air fanciful theories from Vienna . She glanced at Charles 's face , but there was nothing to be1 1IVeA ' WOL7S S9gathered from his mask of cold , indifferent courtesy . When Alec had finished speaking and switched his chair back towards the table , in a way which might easily have broken one of its legs , Charles said quietly : " One can not , I think , be sure how far nervous derangement goes . All sorts of trifling differences may act as signals to the submergedconsciousness . Pleasure should be the foremost and is the most helpful of these signals , and food is usually considered the most elemental form of pleasure . I have found it useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying , diet , I have observed that satisfactory physical results follow . " Charles spoke to Alec , with an air of mingled diffidence and determination , which Jane rather liked . It was obvious that he meant neither to imposeon Alec nor to ignore him ; and still less did he propose to be cowed by Alec 's smothered truculence . Nothing more was said about food . Charles changed the subject to exercise and occupational therapy . These were Alec 's favourite hobbies , the finest work in the hospital , on these lines , had been his own creation . But he was not going to share any of his enthusiasm with Charles . He remainedobstinately silent . Alec 's expression said that Charles could find out for himself . He would answer questionsif they were forced upon him , but he would initiate nothing . Jane found herself obliged to speak for both of them . She told Charles what had been done and what they still hoped to do . Even the most non-social of their patientshad some form of occupation to break into the perpetualweariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make paper , and the more co-operative could find in the workrooms , and on the farm , an outlet for their greater energy . Charles listened , and approved , and suggested . He actually said things which Jane and Alec had said to each other , but Alec never changed his expression of forbidding isolation. 6o PIV4Te WORLVSHe sat with his chair slightly hitched away from Charles , his head flung back , with an expression like an animal 's that has just been slapped in the face . Charles , after a glance or two at him , rather naturally addressed the brunt of his conversation to Jane . She met his remarks , as well as she could , torn between the desire to help him feel at home in his new surroundings and an equal desire not to let Alec feel more out of it than she could help . Charles 's voice grew more strained as he went on under the challenge of Alec 's inimical silence . Obviously he had made up his mind what to say upon the chief aspects of their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equally obvious to Jane that to have to force his opinions upon unwilling hearers was torture to him . Jane longed to show him greater co-operation and friendliness , but she did not dare . Alec 's silence was odious , but to risk another of his derisive explosions would be still worse . At last Charles 's voice dragged itself to an end . A long and petrifying silence took its place . A little sunshine in the room , Jane thought , would have been some help , but it was raining as if it meant never to do anything else but rain . Charles pulled himself together for one more effort . " Perhaps , " he said politely , " you could make your change over next week ? Would Monday be convenient to you ? " Alec spoke at last . He said sullenly : " One time is just about as convenient to me as another . I will change tomorrowif it suits Everest . " Alec never took administrative details with sufficient seriousness , but he need not have advertised this to Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so instantaneous a change . Jane said hurPIVeATWOL1S 61riedly , " A week would be better , I think . " Charles nodded . She rose ; Alec rose ; Charles stood up , behind his desk , and looked at them with a dignified but baffled helplessness which Jane found touching . He wanted to be nice to them ; indeed , as far as facts went , he had been nice to them ; but he did not know how to make his niceness palatable . You could not , as Jane knew from experience , be friendly if you were shy , unless someone else was so friendly that you forgot you had to be , and just enjoyed yourself . It was Alec who could have warmed the atmosphere into instant comfort if he had wished to do so . Instead of which he had deliberately forced it below zero . Charles 's hands , not quite hidden from Jane by the angleof the desk , clenched and unclenched themselves . " I hope " he said stiffly , and stopped short . Janesmiled encouragingly at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Charles probably disliked encouraging women , ceased to smile . Alec made an impatient movement , as if he were going to dash out of the room in front of her , but decided upon something still more tiresome , and , flinging open the door , shepherded Jane out of it , as if he were protecting her from assault . Jane could not prevent it , she had to leave the room , while Charles , with half of his kind sentence congealed into silence , was still struggling to finish it . Alec shut the door loudly behind them both , and burst into a flood of decorative profanity . Jane did not wait for him to finish . She cut through one of the most gorgeous of his phrases . " You simply make bad  --  worse ! " she told him angrily , and fled down the passage to her work. 62 1 , IV , AT WOALVSIn and out of a flurry of new emergencies and decisions , Jane found herself wondering what it was that Charles had hoped ; and wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER VIIIALL the men on the verandah were asleep , except the case which Jane was watching . Sleep had called off the pitiless sentry of their consciousness , and for a few hours at least their unquiet minds were at rest . The air was still and keen . The stars glittered like frozen splinters from the sinking moon . The garden Jane looked into seemed filled with a deep design of tranquillity . The new patient talked to himself in a low , rapid voice . It was a never-ending , rambling attempt to justify himself against the normal world . From time to time there flashed out from his confused mutterings some signpost on the road his soul had taken ; and Jane jotted it down , for Alec 's future guidance . Every now and then she could hear Dawson , the male nurse , moving to and fro on a night errand . Sometimes a sleeper would throw up an arm , or shout out suddenly , caught in the grip of some pursuing dream ; but for the most part there was an unbroken silence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there before her eyes , helpless and savage . His splendid frame was unused ; his mind in utter revolt against the laws of his being ; his heart empty . Nobody else was punishing him : the judge he could not escape was at the root of his own being . There was no love in him for anyone else ; no sane activity ; no humanfellowship ! And because of the lack of these things , he was now hounding himself out of the possession of all64 1 ' 1 , IV4T  --  WOJ ( LDS 1 1RIVeATE WOL1S 65his faculties . They could not function in the wilderness he had made . His delirious monotone checked itself suddenly . He raised himself on an elbow , looked round him uneasily , and fixed his eyes on Jane . " Who are you ? " he demanded truculently . " You let me in here , did n't you ? I 'll do you in for that ! " " What is the matter ? " Jane asked gently ; " are n't you comfortable here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A fat lot anyonecares whether I 'm comfortable or not ! " Self-pity swept over him in a softening flood . The sense of injury was so perversely sweet to him that his anger lessened . He turned his fierce , disappointed eyes away from Jane , and sank back into dramatic recitative . In it he ruled everyone . He came out triumphant . He had what he wanted . Jane listened with a faint smile to the interminable hymn of his self-praise . She knew where his pitiful delusion of heroism came from ; and the depths of fear which it was there to support . Since this poor life-belt , to which he clung so desperately , had failed him , how was she to substitute for it , in mid-ocean , that simpler lesson of learning how to swim ? Fear is like an insect that lives on dirt . If you cleaned out your soul there was nothing for it to feed on . The man in front of her had supplied his soul with more and more dirt for fear to feed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to work his anger off on outsideobjects . Jane had a curious feeling that somewhere lately she had been watching a similar struggle in a saner mind nearer her own . She was used to these sudden juxtapositionsof consciousness , to finding here and there among the patients one whose conflicts resembled her own , or Alec 's . It was Alec who had first pointed these likenesses out to her . " I have the manic-drive , " he had told her , " and you the schizophrenic 's sly retreats . " Was the man before her a caricature of Alec ? Alec , submerged and shorn of all the glory of his brilliant intellect ? Was this fear Alec 's  --  and this desire to triumph , in order to compensate himself for fear ? How could she get Alec to see that both were false ? In this new situation between himself and Charles there was no real ground for rivalry . The hospital was large enough for all of them . Each doctor had his individualduties , and each one the satisfaction of his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to their desires , they could avoid the painfulness of a personal attitude . She had her own private difficulties to surmount in this new situation . She was haunted , as Alec need never be haunted , by Charles 's cruel likeness , and unlikeness , to her dead lover ; but this , too , she could train herself to ignore . Charles could not be expected to be nicer to her because he looked like Michael ; and as long as she reminded herselfof the complete stranger he was , the treachery in her heart would be as idle and ephemeral as a dream . " One can check a morbid fancy , " Jane told herself , " as easily as a morbid symptom , once one has found its cause . " " I 'm going to do you in ! " shouted her patient truculentlyinto the black night . No one answered him . The other patients slept on . Perhaps she might give him a draught , and let him too have a little sleep ? She had learned as much of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane rose slowly to her feet and looked down at him compassionately . Dawson came round the screen from the back of the ward , and stood beside her . " Do you think he 's going off , Doctor ? " he asked in an anxious undertone. 66 1 RIVeAre W  --  LVSJane shook her head . " I doubt it , " she said quietly ; " but I think we 'll give him a draught and let him have a little sleep . He finds himself pretty poor company just now . Go and get it while I stay here . " " I do n't hardly like to leave you alone with him , Doctor , " Dawson protested . " It 'll be all right , " Jane said soothingly , though she was not sure how she knew that it was going to be all right . A strange sense of peace flowed through all her being . It was so great that , standing by the bedside of her restless patient , she was aware that he too felt it . Dawson obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumbling and muttering his half-hearted threats . Jane stood motionless , looking away from him into the quiet night . The moon had sunk behind the garden wall , only the stars glittered on through the unwavering darkness . When Dawson came back , Jane stooped over the patientand gave him the draught . " Are you my mother ? " he suddenly demanded . Jane smiled and shook her head ; but as she left the ward she had a feeling that in a sense she could n't define , and which left her strangely bereft now that her task was over , she had been used as a mother . Perhaps this leaving of the men 's side of the hospital was not so good a thing as Charles had thought it was . Perhaps he had overlooked that the insane are children , and that back of their wild minds is the child need , to be reassured of its integrity , by that Power which should have given its own integrity to the child . " But I shall never be able to tell him anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " even if it 's true . " CHAPTER IXJANE had not remembered that it was her last day on the men 's side till evening ; then , as she was doing the night rounds with Sister Stanton for the last time , it flashed through her mind : " This wo n't happen again like this ! When I come here again , I shall be only a visitor ! " " I do n't think I shall turn in just yet , " she said suddenly to Sister Stanton . " Go back to your office , Sister . I should like to take a final look at my Arab . He 's very low to-night ! " " It 's very late already , Doctor ; you 'll get no night at all , " Sister Stanton pleaded . Jane shook her head with a smile of dismissal . She did not want a night , she wanted a fixed and final vision of her work . It had been her first sole charge . For eighteen months the care and protection of these three hundred men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to take leave of the men individually , except automatically in her mind . What she was taking leave of was herself  --  that part of her which she had used on them because they were men , and which she would not need again when her work was among women . In all Jane 's dealings with the men , she had been as near sexless as a woman can be ; but she knew there was no such thing as complete sexlessness . What she had given her men they could not find in Alec , and what she had taken from them she would not receive from her women patients . She thought to herself : " What is it I shall take away ? What is it I shall lose ? " But she found no answer . The hospital was completely still . She barely glanced68 1 I V eAT E W O L D Sinto the long dim wards in turn ; smiled at their quiet guardians and slipped out again unseen . At last she came to the most distant ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . She unlocked the door and braced herself afresh to meet the familiar tension of the unexpected . The new nurse Clarkson came forward to greet her . " Why are you on duty here alone ? " Jane demanded . " I ordered a special ' to share night duty with you ! " " Yes , I know , Doctor , but Matron , she said it was n't necessary and she was n't going to have her wards clutteredup with specials . I do n't think it 's a one-man job . There 's half-a-dozen of ' em in this ward here that seem up to any mischief ! " " That depends upon the man in charge ! " Jane said drily . " Why are those screens round the Arab 's bed ? " " The new Superintendent ordered it . He 's in there with him now , " Clarkson explained . " Talking his own lingo to the Arab , as far as I can make out , Doctor ! But what with the Black the other end , and the new boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen ! " Jane had told Charles about the Arab , but he had not said that he spoke Arabic . The Matron had had no business to give such an order to Clarkson . It was a flagrant instance of her interference . No doubt she was trying it on , to see what Charles would let pass under the new regime . The test would have had to come sooner or later . Jane decided to accept it . She would report the Matron to Charles ; and leave the hospital if Charles did not uphold her authority . " You must carry on for to-night , " she told Clarkson briefly . She moved silently forward through the dimly lit ward , 1 RIVATE WOLVS 69between the lines of the restless sleepers , and pushed back one of the Arab 's screens . Neither of the two men heard her . Charles knelt by the Arab 's bed , his fair head bent over the withered blackness of the dying Arab . Jane saw Charles 's face , as if for the first tune  --  without self-consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself ; but when he is not thinking of himself , he can not lie . Charles , stripped of all his defences , was worth looking at . The soul that looked out of his eyes into those dying eyes was both brave and kind . She put down the injection she had meant to give the Arab on the night table . It was too late to bother him with it . She saw , at a glance , that the end was near . The Arab 's face was covered with that blanched darkness which spreads over the face of waters at the coming of night . His cheeks had fallen in ; his breath came in quick , shallow gasps . His fiery eyes burned , like pits of flame , in the clenched gravity of his face . He knew that he was dying ; but the agony of his long loneliness was broken at last . He understood Charles . Jane watched the wonder and joy rise in his eyes , and for a time hold back the pressure of death . The soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in her heart , strange images of the desert , and of an alien world . Charles paused for a moment ; then very slowly and distinctly he gave the desert form of greeting and farewell . " Go with God ! " With a long sigh , which seemed to shake the soul out ofhis body , the Arab answered it , and went upon his way . In the timeless moment that follows the extinction oflife , Jane was conscious that the guarded look came backto Charles 's face . The Arab , deprived of his soul , looked7o 1 IVeATE WOL'DS 1 RIVeAT 5 ' WOW.LIS 71inconceivably dried and empty , like the husk of a dead locust . A shadow flickered upon the wall behind Charles 's head . Jane wanted to slip away before Charles had time to notice her , but something in the flickering of that shadow fixed her attention . She turned to see what was causing it . With a cry of warning she sprang forward and seized the arm of the black paranoiac . The fingers that would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . She heard Clarkson 's belated cry , " My God , Doctor  --  it 's Jerry ! " The lamp overturned ; but Charles was on his feet beside her . She shouted for Clarkson to pinion Jerry from behind ; but she had no faith in his doing so . She was being whipped to and fro like a piece of chaff caught in a machine . She remembered that Jerry 's trick was strangling . " Mind your throat ! " she gasped feebly to Charles . The only answer that came was the sudden pressure of Jerry 's thumb on her own windpipe . But the great hand had no time to fix itself before it was flung off again . The grip on her shoulder relaxed . She found her feet and could have freed herself , but she hung on to the massive , heaving arm with all her strength . The three of them moved in long , uneven jerks , like slow motion pictures on a screen . The scrambling , grunting , ding-long struggle in the dark seemed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of hoarse breathing , but through it she listened for the even more ominous sound of the ward risingbehind them . She was not conscious of fear , but somewhere in the back of her mind she recognised with a cold clarity that if Clarkson did not reach the alarm bell in time , neither she nor Charles would leave the ward alive . It came at last , sudden shrieks and chuckles of maniaclaughter , and the quick , pattering rush of bared feet . Close to her ear she heard the unmistakable snap of a breaking bone . Charles cried out : " Let go ! Let go , you little fool ! " But of course Jane did n't let go . Jerry , unhindered , would make short work of Charles . The alarm bell began to ring , peal after peal . Light ran over them , a blinding , dazzling ally . Sister Stanton 's voice rose implacably above the tumult . The ward filled rapidly with nurses and attendants . Someone pinioned Jerry 's arms from behind . Jane was free now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat again . Charles laughed down at her . " You see , " he said , with exultant , dancing eyes , " I was right ! It is n't a very suitablejob for women ! " Jane ignored Charles ; she brushed aside a bevy of nurses who wanted to know if she was n't hurt . She moved forward unsteadily , to tell the attendants not to be rough with Jerry . He was still shouting and struggling while he was being hauled off to where he could carry on his fight , innocuously , against padded walls . Dangerous patients had already become terrified children and were scrambling back to bed . There was something else in Jane 's mind besides Charles 's laughter . She turned and looked at him . He was standing where she had left him , holding his wrist with his other hand . " That was the snapped bone , then ! " Jane said . " You had better come to the theatre at once and have it attendedto ! " Charles followed her obediently ; but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , her throat still felt72 PlVeATE AV OLDSstiff ; and for another she thought Charles 's laughter , after such a scene in the ward , was out of place . She was exasperated by such a thing happening before the eyes of a new Superintendent in the part of the hospitalof which she was in charge . It never had happened before  --  itnever should have happened ! It was inexcusable . The theatre , empty , hot , and immaculate , was a momentaryrelief to her . She gave a quick glance about her , fixed the Rontgen ray behind Charles 's wrist , and clicked off the light . There was something friendly in the spluttering , hissingdarkness . Jane could see exactly where the shadow lay over the split bone . The plate showed up his wrist beautifully . " A simple fracture , " she said with relief . " If it had been a compound one , would you have been angrier still ? " Charles rather unexpectedly murmured . Jane made no answer ; but she felt it difficult to go on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor could she forget Charles 's face , bent down to meet the dying Arab 's . However angry they might both be in the future , it would be difficult not to remember that they could rely on each other . Jane turned on the light without answering Charles ; but she was conscious that the sternness had gone out of her face . " It would never have happened , " she explained a little breathlessly , " if you had not put screens round the Arab 's bed . Jerry can not bear anything to be kept from him . And of course he knew that you were the new Superintendent , and resented doubly your interest in his rival . Black patients are specially sensitive . Still , if Maclean had been on duty , he would have known how to nip the trouble in the bud . There would have been no such rising . That is the worst of using a new man alone on night duty. 1 1IVeATe WOM , TS 73I shall have to report to you that Clarkson was on duty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked for a special . ' " " Who disregarded your orders ? " Charles asked her . Jane fastened his splint carefully before replying . " Clarkson , " she said , when she had finished to her satisfaction , " told me that the Matron had ordered him to take Maclean 's place , while he was away on an emergency visit , and had refused him the assistance I had ordered . She has no such authority . Such a disturbance has never occurred before in my whole five years ' experience in this hospital . Nor should it have occurred now , though no doubt it will be difficult for you to believe this . " " So far I have found no difficulty in believing what you have told me , " Charles said , with a faint smile . " It is certainly not the Matron 's business to set aside a doctor 's orders , nor to refuse specials for your bad cases . I will see that this is put before her . I gave the order to isolate the Arab myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to him . I found out he was a desert Arab , and they are lonely fellows . " " I did not know you spoke Arabic , " Jane said in a low voice . " No  --  ? " said Charles . " Well  --  I served for a year , when I was seventeen , in Egypt . My uncle was working under Lawrence , and got me out there . I stayed on anotheryear and learned Arabic . " Jane said nothing further . Charles made a good patient . He stood stock-still , and in difficult rnoments kept his mouth shut . Jane knew that she had made a good job of his wrist , and been no longer about it than she could help . She must have hurt him ; but he would know that she had not hurt him more than she must . " By-the-way , " Charles said , rather more stiffly , while74 1 1RIVe/I T  --  WORLDSshe was making a sling , " I am aware that you saved my life to-night . I should n't have cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black rascal 's thumb . I 'm really much obliged to you . " " Oh , well , " Jane said , finishing off his sling and turning away from him to tidy up the theatre , " if it comes to that , I suppose you saved mine ; so you need n't be annoyedby my small share of the shindy ! " She was glad to get away from that handsome , dishevelled figure leaning against the table . " I 'm not at all annoyed , " Charles assured her . " I 'm grateful ! " " Well , nothing could be more annoying to you than having to be grateful , could it ? " Jane allowed herself to demand , with a hint of laughter . To her surprise Charles laughed too , rather a nice , amused laugh . " We 're quits , then , " he admitted . " I do n't know whether you noticed that your head hit the bedpost ? You might put some iodine on it before you leave the theatre . I 'm afraid I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane glanced casually into the small theatre mirror . Her coat was torn to ribbons ; her hair was in wild disorder ; one of her temples was badly bruised , and Jerry 's purple thumb-mark stood out unmistakably upon her slender throat . With a pang of horror she realised that she had never rung for the night sister ! What could Charles have thought of her ? To be guilty of such a breach of etiquette , on the top of being responsible for such a catastrophe ! " I 'm terribly sorry , " she said humbly , " that I forgot to ring for Sister ! I 'm afraid that I must have been more shaken than I realised . You should have reminded me . " " Oh , well , you know , I preferred it , " Charles rather surprisingly murmured. 1 ICI VeAT E W O IZLV S 75They walked in silence out into the corridor , but when they reached the turning where Charles should have left her , to reach his quarters , Jane found that he was still walking beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to face those long , dim corridors alone . Charles came with her to her sitting-room . She gave him a stiff whisky-and-soda , and to please him drank a milder one herself . He stayed a very short while , only long enough to ask her casually if she supposedBarnes and Harding had got back yet . It was three o'clock in the morning , and Jane told him there was no doubt that they had . After Charles had gone , it suddenly occurred to Jane that he had come back with her simply to make sure that she was not alone in the quarters . To do you a service without putting you under the obligation of noticing it was , she thought , Charles 's way of being kind . CHAPTER X IT WOULD not have been true to suppose that Charles had no affections . He liked tortoises , and when he came to King 's Norton he brought Billy , his favourite tortoise , with him . To be surrounded by a hard shell , to put your head in when approached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled baggy trousers , were all traits which endeared themselves to Charles . Charles could be , and generally was , rigidly tidy ; but he considered clothes to be a form of domestic tyranny which he could not control and did not want to be con- trolled by . Clothes were the kind of thing his sister Myra liked . But on the night of his first dinner party to his col- leagues , Charles had decided to dress properly . He even wore a white tie and tails , in honour of Sally 's being a bride . His studs were milky black pearls , and his links matched them . When he was dressed , he walked about his new room with more appreciation than he cared to show . He liked his new home , and his new job , and he wanted to like his new colleagues . There were plenty of bookshelves in the room , a deep heather-coloured carpet , a divan or two , and long bare outlines of chairs made of steel bands and black webbing . These chairs did not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that they exactly fitted you . After several well-executed family rows , Myra had re- luctantly effaced a cocktail bar . The walls and ceilings were the faintest possible rose- 1 WIVeAT 6 ' WOLDS 77colour seen through clouded white . If you felt imaginative you could see yourself standing on a heather-covered hill at dawn ; if you felt practical , there was a large kitchen table in an alcove , where you could work in peace . An oak-panelled slip of a room behind the studio held a long , narrow Last Supper-ish oak table , decorated with scarlet leaves , crystal and old silver . Charles was not fond of pictures , but he put up with a Lawrence and two Raeburns which were family portraits , and let them hang above the dining-room table . The silver was polished into the white sharpness of frost . Only Myra 's temper used on a plastic parlour-maid could have achieved such a triumphant result . Looking up , Charles saw Myra standing in the doorway , watching him . Her mass of red-gold hair rose up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never quite sure what Myra had done to her eyes and eyebrows , but they were n't quite the same as he remembered them to have been in the nursery . Perugino'sMadonnas wore the same softly sceptical smile . Charles had often thought that no woman could be so serenely mild as Perugino 's Madonnas looked . Myra was dressed in silver and white . She carried three flame-coloured ostrich feathers in her hand . She was tryingherself out against the hardened blankness of Charles 's eyes . Her curved , childlike lips were just touched with a deeper pink than nature cares to supply . Charles knew that men liked kissing them , but he had never been able to understand why . " These damned people are certain to be on time , " Myra softly murmured , moving forward slowly into the room . She flicked a leaf or two on the table into picturesque disorder . " So I had to hurry . You look rather dressed up , Charles ! It will be amusing to see who you 've dressed up for ! Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  WORLDSwith a husband like a village blacksmith , surely ? I ca n't see why I have to know such people at all . It would have been far more amusing if you 'd invited six of your patientsto dinner with us instead . " " You have only to be polite to my colleagues for an hour or two , " Charles reassuringly explained . " They will , I fancy , realise that you are not their sort quite as readily as you realise that they are not yours . They may look like village blacksmiths and untidy schoolgirls , but you 'll find they 've got wits . " " Highbrows ! " murmured Myra contemptuously . " That makes everything worse ! A little primitive fun is far less boring than anything that hag in a starched pique coat I saw the other day could put up ! Leaking brains at every pore  --  dreadful woman ! " She had guessed whom Charles was dressing up for ! Myra tried the effect of a silver basket full of purple grapes in the middle of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a whiff of wild geranium scent behind her . Charles found himself wondering , if Myra meant to do him any more harm , how was he going to prevent it ? Not that Charles thought Myra did altogether mean to do him harm . She had ruined his life , as near as it is possible for another human being to ruin anyone else 's life . But all she had set out to do , as she had often explained to Charles , was to live her own life in her own way ! Charles had devoted his entire fortune to preventing Myra from being hanged . She had never , he knew , forgivenhim for knowing the truth about her . She called it putting the worst construction upon an innocent act . The revolver had somehow or other got into Myra 's hands and gone off , and Peter  --  her husband  --  had fallen backwards down the stairs ; and been picked up  --  dead . Charles had not forgiven Myra either . In the abstract1 IVeAT E W O LT S 79Charles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging does not take place in the abstract . Fortunately Charles had never had another friend for Myra to kill . His first guests arrived punctually on the stroke of eight . Sally wore her wedding dress . It was a pity that Myra 's dress was white too , it made Sally 's white dress look lumpy and childish . Directly afterwards came Tom and Bertha Hurst , the research workers . Charles thought he might be going to rather like his research workers , though he wished they were not married to each other . They were intelligent , simple people , who hardly ever put their best clothes on ; and this was what their best clothes looked like . Jane , who had to do double rounds before she came over , was rather late . Charles saw that Myra thought Jane was late on purpose , but on the whole he knew that she would despise Jane rather less than if Jane had been punctual . He barely glanced at Jane himself , when she did at last arrive , but he was reassured by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely young man , came with her . Dr. Harding , whom Charles disliked , was on duty in the hospital . The introductions took place without any of Charles 's colleagues realising that they were being introduced to the famous Myra Anderson , who had barely been acquittedfor murdering her husband . Not that Myra would have minded if they had guessed who she was . She often told people just for the fun of annoying Charles . But to-night Charles thought  --  unless Myra got drunk  --  she would n't let any of them know . Charles took Sally in to dinner . On his left sat Bertha Hurst ; beyond her was Alec ; then Myra ; Tom Hurst ; Jane and Barnes. 8o 1 IVeATE WOLVS 1 1RIVeA7 E WORLDS 8ishould simply be done away with altogether . As for the unemployed Charles sighed gently and gave attention to his soup . It was a subtle , asparagus soup , made with cream and a drop or two of sherry . How sophisticated Myra 's soups always were , and how infantile her mind ! It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear Myra sharing them ! Charles returned to Sally . Sensible child , she knew where roads led to ! Charles was an earnest motorist and he liked to talk about roads . Sally did n't tell him too much at once , nor did she mix her facts , but she did rather drag Alec in ! Still Charles hardly expected a bride of a few months ' standing to avoid that particular failing . If Alec were not directly responsiblefor the favourable upkeep of roads , he knew the names of all the villages  --  and any dangerous cross-roads , or blind corners , within a radius of a hundred miles . A faint , an almost tender smile , touched Charles 's lips . He wondered what it would be like to have a bride , so wrapped up in you that you had to be served up with every course and enter into every topic ! Did Alec , too , find Sally in the salmon croquettes , and a description of her applicable to the sayings of Winston Churchill  --  or was it by now Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later , enter into Myra 's conversation and lead the way to Mussolini . They had already got there ! He heard Myra saying that what England needed was a Mussolini or an Adolf Hitler ! A few machine guns closely applied would remove the world crisis . Alec grew restive . He flatly contradicted Myra . Myra 's azure eyes expanded incredulously ; but on the whole Charles knew that she liked men who began by being restive . No doubt they tasted , Charles told himself , betterCharles liked Sally . He wished she were not quite so shy , but her shyness made him kind ; and when Charles was kind , he was so nice that Sally was in danger of forgettinghow much she ought to hate him . Charles knew that Sally would have to hate him , for Alec 's sake , and he liked her the better for it . Still he found Bertha Hurst easier to talk to . He enjoyed laboratorywork more than any other part of his profession , and Bertha lived for it . Charles thought she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would n't talk with her mouth full and had given rather more discriminating attention to her teeth and hair . It was a pity that nice women did not know how important such things were  --  since less nice women always did ! Charles let his eyes stray across the table . He found himself wondering whether Jane were a more , or less , nice woman . She wore a dress of fuchsia and very pale lilac , and her long amethyst earrings matched it . She was n't talking at all when Charles looked at her . She was listening , with an expression she often had , as if she liked taking things in better than having to give anything out . There was a kind of restrained sparkle about her . She looked as if she appreciated good clothes and well-cooked food , but not to the point of exaggerating their importance . Myra was speaking in a high , slightly metallic voice . She thought that talking at all  --  to such people  --  was very considerate of her and should rouse their instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bimetallism is what we really need , " Myra asserted . " It stands to reason that if there is n't enough gold , we should use silver too . It 's so silly of all those clever men not to do anything about it . I think taxes82 1 1IV42 e WORLDSafterwards ; like birds cooked while their blood is still warm . Bertha began to talk about a new method of plant injectionwhich interested Charles . He knew more about it than Bertha did , but he was too good a host to betray his own knowledge . He listened to her respectfully ; and when he disagreed with her , he made his disagreement sound like a compliment . Suddenly he heard Myra challenge Jane . She was saying , in that curious pert voice she often used to women who were more intelligent than herself , " Do you like your profession , Dr. Everest ? I think it must be horrid , and rather coarsening for a woman , to have to deal with mad people . " " I find there is not much difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity . The screen is out of repair in the latter case , but the light that comes through it is the same individual light . The course it followsis a logical course . " Charles liked Jane 's answer . In the main he agreed with it . One might go even further and say that in most cases the screen was not even out of repair  --  the use made of the light was the trouble . But Jane had the sense not to go down into anything . She knew that what Myra wanted was to find her learned and dull . " I do n't think I know quite what you mean , " Myra replied , turning plaintively to Alec . " Is she being frightfullyclever , Dr. Macgregor ?  --  do help me ! I suppose women doctors always are  --  are n't they ? I 'm afraid I do n't quite believe in medicine for women ; nor does Charles , I know . I hope you do n't mind my being so frank , Dr. Everest ? " " Not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which proved that she had a dimple in her cheek . " Why should I mind frankness ? Many people disapprove of1 IVeAT E WHO LTS 83women doctors . Still , we exist , nevertheless , and increase . And one is rather glad to find that we are usually disapproved of by people who know least about us . " Myra directed a piercingly lovely smile at Alec . " Oh , well , " she murmured , " I suppose one never trusts other women really . Men are so much kinder , are n't they ?  --  and fairer , too , I always think . It would be too awful , being ill and having to be told by another woman that it was all nerves , or that one ought to wear flannel next one 's skin , and give up smoking ! " " All doctors , men or women , " Alec assured her , " take nerves seriously now-a-days , as they should every other symptom of illness . Nerves are no longer looked on as things in the air ; and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's duty to tell you so . " Myra gave him a still more enchanting smile , which somehow or other left Jane entirely out of the discussion . " But I 'm sure if I were really ill , " she murmured , " you 'd be awfully sorry for me  --  much sorrier than Dr. Everest would be , for instance ! " Alec flushed . Myra 's marvellously caressing eyes had gone deeper than her words . Sally 's attention wandered from discussing roads with Charles . Charles noticed that Alec behaved properly . He brushed aside his roused sensations . " A good doctor , " he said stubbornly , " has only one way of being really sorry for his patients , and that is by being intelligent about them . Has n't he , Jane ? " Did Sally like that sudden appeal to Jane any better than she liked Myra 's caressingness ? Charles leaned forward to hear what Jane would make of Alec 's appeal . " Unfortunately we have never yet discovered a thermometerfor the emotions , " Jane said drily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sorry one is for one 's patients84 1 1VeATE WOLDScompared with the sympathy shown by a male colleague . The greatest consideration any doctor can show to a patientis in fighting his disease . " Sally , with the faintest possible sigh , returned to the quickest way of getting Charles on to the Great North Road . A marvellous dessert came in , made of whipped cream , apples , walnuts , and jam . Charles heard Myra saying that she had picked it up from a brigand chief in Bulgaria . Charles knew that Myra had never been in Bulgaria , and he doubted if brigand chiefs have much inclination for whipping cream . He suddenly met Jane 's eyes for the first time . Did she , too , suspect that the dessert had come from some less romantic source ? There was a sparkle in her grey-green eyes , which , when they met Charles 's , turned to silent laughter . Myra caught Bertha Hurst 's attention , and led the way back into the rosy cloud of the studio . They all tried Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who picturesquely sank upon a black divan , exposing a most beautiful line of thigh . This probably meant that she would n't play bridge . Charles thought it a mistake . They had talked enough for people who do not know each other and have not the same conversational standards . But there was no use doinganything about it . If Myra meant to subjugate Alec , any kind of obstruction from Charles , however passive , would merely hasten the process . Coffee and liqueurs came in , and Charles reminded himself that Jane was the proper person for him to talk to now . But when he had taken a chair near her , he found that neither of them had anything to say to the other . He could n't say that he was surprised to see that Jane1 1R IVeA'T E W O L S 85had such a pretty foot , although that was all which keeping his eyes on the ground put into his head . Jane did not seem any more intelligent . At last she said : " I hope your wrist is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles have that nasty accident ? " Myra demanded . " He says he fell against something at the hospital . He must have been dreadfully clumsy ! " " What he fell against was Jerry , " Alec tactlessly informedthe room . " Jerry had one of his tantrums and tried to do you both in , did n't he ? " Alec glanced across the room at Charles as if he were sorry that Jerry had n't succeeded . Even after a fortnight of Charles 's most perfect consideration , Alec had to be belligerent whenever he looked at Charles . " Not really ! " Myra exclaimed delightedly . " Now that sounds really thrilling ! Do tell me more about it . Charles , why did n't you let me know what happened ? I thought you said that lunatics were always perfectly safe ? " " Not quite , " Charles murmured wearily . " I think that I may have said that if properly handled they were very seldom dangerous . " He wondered how Jane had known that he wanted to smoke a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so inconspicuously that it was hardly necessary for him to thank her . " I wish I 'd been there ! " Dr. Barnes groaned . " Just my luck that the only time the alarm bell was rung had to be my night out ! Sister Stanton said she 'd never seen such a hefty brawl ! " " Ah ! " said Myra significantly . " You must take me to see Jerry , Dr. Macgregor . I want to go all over the hospital . Charles wo n't take me , but you will  --  wo n't you ? " 86 1 IVeATE WOIZL'DSCharles sighed . He did not intend that Myra should enter the hospital ; and up to now she had never expressed a wish to enter it . " I am sorry , " he intervened between the puffs of his pipe , " but what you suggest is n't possible , Myra . You are neither a friend nor a relation of any of the patients , nor have you any official business in the hospital . Ordinary visitors are not admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alec said aggressively . " Any of the medical staff can take a visitor over the hospital if they choose . I see no reason for your sister not seeing over it if she wants to come . " There was a pause . Everyone felt uncomfortable , but nobody felt as uncomfortable as Charles . He smoked on . " I am sorry , " he repeated quietly , looking across the room at Alec , " but I must ask you not to take my sister into the hospital . I do n't consider it suitable . " No one said anything . They all looked shocked ; and they disapproved of Charles . Charles was used to being put in the wrong by Myra ; and he saw that he had now been put thoroughly in the wrong . Everyone knew how near Alec had been to holding Charles 's appointment . Everyone thought Charles was being tyrannical , and discourteous to rub it in . Well , then , they must go on thinking it ! Better that Myra should ruin his first party than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Broadmoor . Perhaps she guessed how very nearly she might have had to see it from the inside ! But had she ruined his evening ? Not everyone disapproved of him . Jane did n't . She had the sense not to show her approval , but Charles knew with a sudden dazzling distinctness , more real than sight , that Jane agreed with him . He looked up and met her eyes . They glanced away1 1RIV A7 e WO LDS 87from him , but not before he had caught their gleam of complicity . Charles looked cautiously round him . No one else had caught it . He found himself wondering what his tortoise did when it was simply pleased . CHAPTER XIJANE seemed rather surprised to see Charles , but she was too polite for him to guess whether she was pleased or not . It was a cold evening , and she sat on a footstool in front of the fire , looking rather small and lonely . She wore pale yellow , with red amber beads round her slim throat . Earringsto match them dangled against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Joshua 's delicate ladies . Charles sat down , rather stiffly , at some little distance from the fireplace , where he could watch Jane 's face withoutappearing to notice her . He could not remember having felt so comfortable since his mother died . It was difficult to define what he felt comfortable about , but he suddenly knew that though Jane might be shy , or might still be disappointed with his having taken Alec 's place , yet , deeper than her shyness and far deeper than her disappointment , she agreed with Charles ! PerhapsJane did n't know that she agreed with him , but Charles knew it ! He rested his long nervous hands on the arms of hischair ; and leaned back , as if an inner tension had suddenlyrelaxed . " I hope Macgregor will enjoy his holiday , " he said after a short pause . Jane replied " Yes ! " and then , as Charles looked past her into the fire and said nothing , Jane added : " He is sure1 IVeA T E WOL S 89to ! " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with Charles whether Alec was pleased or not . Charles asked her if she minded pipes , and she said thatshe did not . Charles could n't remember when he had last thought about a woman without pain or annoyance . Not since Myra 's trial , he supposed . That had rather knocked the subject of pretty girls out of his head . Jane was not pretty ; but she was fastidious and unaggressive , with the kind of distinction Charles liked in women . Still , Charles reminded himself , many fastidious women are as common as dirt ! How often beneath the screen of the most finished physical refinement women were slovenly and mean ! Or , if their souls were tolerably clean and decent , they had the most banal minds ! He told himself he must be careful of this woman , who made him feel so comfortable . He did not want his heart touched or his pocket picked . He had always thought the hunger of the flesh like any other hunger ; not much prettier ; and fortunately not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence ; and he liked keepingit to himself . He owed no woman anything . His body was thoroughly healthy and hygienically controlled . He could therefore afford friendship with a woman who attractedhim , up to a certain point . Jane did n't look as if she were the kind of woman who would try to attract him beyond it ; and she would n't find it much use if she did . Charles 's eyes ran relentlessly over her . Her nails were short and clean ; her ankles neat . She had n't any superfluousflesh , and her skin , though not at all dazzling , had a clean pallor . She had fought for his life with those rather capable hands . You could trust a woman 's courage when she could quite easily have got off cheap , and let you strangle 190 1 1ZIVeAT6 ' WOLVS 1 1ZIVT6 ' WOLTS 91Besides , she had risked her life , not to save a man she liked , but a stranger whom she had some reason to dislike . If Jane had liked Charles , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save him . She knew her job , too ! That dementia-prEecox case  --  how well she had handled it ! She had got the fellow in without a row ; and started his treatment with his poor confused mind unchallenged and unhostile ! It was almost a pity having had to shift her from the men 's side  --  but much more suitable ! And now he 'd got Macgregor off for a month , to give her time to settle down ! A month , having a good time with his little bride , would n't do Macgregor any harm either ! " Mrs. Macgregor , " Charles said slowly , puff-mg contentedlyat his pipe , " is rather a nice woman , I should think . " " She and her husband are my best friends , " said Jane defensively , as if Charles were making some kind of attack on them . Charles did not blame her for feeling annoyed . She would keep quiet about it . That was the comfort of dealing with a person who was of your own sort . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought on Jane 's part  --  and she was capable of thinking  --  would help her to adjust her conflicting loyalties . Charles need do nothing about it . He crossed his legs , and looked about the room with his mind at ease . Jane had a few good etchings , nothing else on the walls ; no ornaments in the room ; plenty of books . You could n't see what kind of woman she was from her room , it was too impersonal ; but you could easily see what kind of woman she was n't . She was n't untidy , nor had shegot one of those cluttered-up minds with soft spots in them . She said , a little grudgingly , after a long pause : " It was kind of you to send the Macgregors off just now  --  on account of Dr. Armitage 's illness they never had a proper honeymoon . " " Oh , well , " Charles hastily explained , " a friend of mine can come to-morrow , for a month . It worked quite easily . Not exactly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His name 's Hatchard . " Charles felt that he had told Jane quite a lot about Hatchard . " Broadmoor ? " Jane asked . " Oh , no ! " Charles said , and felt as if he had told Jane quite a lot about Broadmoor . It would be curious if he began to tell Jane quite a lot about things ! She got up and offered Charles a whisky-and-soda , askinghim how much whisky he took , and then pouring in the soda-water to save his wrist . She drank nothing herself , but when she sat down on her little footstool again , she lit a cigarette . Charles saw that her anger had gone now , or , at any rate , she had disposed of it conveniently enough for conversationalpurposes . " Do you think you are going to mind working on the women 's side ? " he asked her . Jane gave the funny little smile he liked , the one that had first shown him that she had a dimple , and said : " Oh , you know I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm used to the change . At first it 's puzzling , and I 'm rather like a cat  --  I notice new things as if they were shocks -- but I get used to them . I 've got a case now I 'm particularly puzzled over . You could n't , I think , get anything quite like it in a man . I should like your opinion upon it . " 92 1 JVeAT e W O LV SCharles shifted his eyes to hers . Jane 's eyes were a bluer green than he had remembered ; not a hard or bright blue , but a little misty , like wood smoke on an autumn day . Charles never had liked shining eyes . He gave a sympathetic grunt , to show Jane that when she had stated her case , she should have his opinion . He was not a man to give his opinion lightly , but probably Jane had already guessed that , and would n't presume upon his consent . She seemed quite satisfied with Charles 's grunt , for she went on after a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's a new patient , and she 's been crying on end for four days and nights . I ca n't get her quiet . Her heart wo n't stand heavy drugging . It 's not an ordinary melancholiccase . She has n't had any attacks before ; and it is not involutional ; she is only thirty . I wish Dr. Macgregor had seen her before leaving . She is the kind of case he reaches much better than I do . He is so much more elec-tric . " Charles nodded . That was the mercy of Jane . She was not electric . Her presence no more weighed upon him than a summer breeze . Charles 's mother had been the same . She could be in a room without Charles having to bother about it , and yet , when she left it , the room felt empty . " Crying for four days and nights is rather an expensive bid for attention , " Charles said slowly . " What type of woman is she ? I suppose she has always been out for prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think she 's let herself down , " Jane said consideringly . " I gather she 's always been fearfully respectable and religious . She 's a Roman Catholic of the most practisingkind . She 's been married ten years . Her husband is a tiresome kind of man ; and drinks . But she seems to have been fond of him . Then one day  --  all of a sudden , 1 1RIVeATE WOLTS 93as it seemed to her  --  she was unfaithful to him . One act  --  not premeditated . She does n't care about the man she was unfaithful with . It was like some awful accident . Now she has gone to pieces over it , and wo n't go on living . I supposeshe was too pure . And now she wants to get back somehow , and be purer than if she had never sinned at all . If she kills herself , she proves herself purer  --  or thinks she has . For , after all , few people die from horror of their sins . I do n't think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having spilled something on a clean frock . " Charles enjoyed this simile . " Very like , " he said drily . " And now she wants to take the frock off and throw it away . It would be interesting to know how many people keep virtuous from vanity alone . Well , what have you tried so far ? " Jane turned her full face towards Charles . The amber earrings made a dark gleaming frame for it . She looked more than ever like one of Sir Joshua 's serene , immaculate ladies . " I asked her priest in to confess her , " Jane told Charles . " I thought her religion might be of some hell ) to her . But we could n't get her to attend to him . Then I sent for her husband , but the sight of him made her worse . She wo n't hear of my sending for the other man . Lucretia could n't have had a greater horror of Tarquin , though I believe the act was quite a voluntary one on my patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . I 've had her in a continuous bath ; and I 've given her sedatives ; but she does n't answer to anything . So now I 've got her back in bed with a special nurse to watch her . At first she understood what we said to her , but I do n't think she does now . " " What did you say to her ? " Charles asked . The questioninterested him . He rather wondered what a woman like Jane felt about chastity , in herself , or in other women. 94 1 1'Z I V eA T S W O 1 L 17 S 1 RI V , /lTe WOL'DS 95He was sure that it would be a question she would think out carefully , and act up to . She would n't just make a hash of it , or go about with an uncontrolled desire , like a man who sends a cheque to his bank with an overdrawn account against him . " I said if she was really sorry she 'd stop crying and go back to her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I thought she was just angry , and unfaithful to her husbandout of revenge . I said I understood that he had been very tiresome , and I thought that , without realising it , she had wanted to punish him for being tiresome  --  only she 'd gone rather too far and punished herself instead . " Charles nodded . This was a line which he himself would have taken . " Yes , " he said reflectively , " I fancy if this lady were really sorry for letting down her husband , she 'd go home and attend to cooking his meals . That fellow Nietzsche put his finger on the right spot when he said that remorse was always a dishonest business . Even God , though He agrees not to despise a broken and a contrite heart , has never expressedmuch satisfaction over one ! People wash out their repentance with tears far more often than they wash it in . " Jane nodded ruefully . " I tried to make her see that , " she explained ; " but you see it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it ! She 's quite intelligent if one could only break through her fantasy about herself . What she needs is someone to startle her  --  and I ca n't startle ! If Dr. Macgregor were here , he 'd do something so surprising that she 'd have to attend to him ! " " And is that what you want me to do ? " Charles demanded , knocking out his pipe . He could n't help smiling at Jane , she looked so ridiculouslyforlorn and shocked at her own failure . As if notto make unfaithfulness palatable to her patient was worse than being unfaithful . Jane smiled back , rather doubtfully . " I thought , " she said hesitatingly , " that you might have a fresh idea . " " I think I 'm rather like you , " Charles murmured , looking away from her . " I do n't find it at all easy to be startling . However , I 'll come along and have a look at your patient , if you like . " Jane sprang to her feet . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Charles was glad to see that she did not take off her earrings or her amber beads . She held herself well , with an easy , unstressed confidence . Charles , following her out into the corridor , thought that Jane would probably have a good seat on a horse . They said nothing further till they stood in a small private room off the ward , and looked down at the moaningwoman on the bed . Her sobs were mechanical , like a continuous hiccup . She seemed unaware of their entrance , or of anything which took place outside herself . Jane dismissed the night nurse and stood behind Charles near the door . She seemed to know by instinct that he would like as little witness as possible to his being startling . Charles bent over the woman and felt her pulse . It was stronger than he had thought it could be , but very quick and irregular . He could n't be certain when a heart , thumping at such a terrific rate , might n't chuck up its job . She could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncanny feeling that she was watching him . He might try electricity , but would the heart stand it ?

" She did n't say anything , but in her tear-sodden eyes Charles saw a gleam that was n't anger . He smiled at her with sudden friendliness . " You keep a stiff upper lip ! " he finished , letting her sink back gently onto the pillow . He felt sorry for the woman . After all , it took a kind of misplaced pluck to die because you had robbed yourofvirtue ; most people rob themselves more easily than that ! It was wonderfully quiet in the little room . All this time Jane had never stirred . Charles wondered if she was annoyed with him . He could not tell by her face . He went out alone , and left her with her patient . Sister Parsons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what had taken place ; but Charles disliked eagerness . He stared coldly past her head , until Jane came out . Jane said what she thought was necessary to Sister Parsons  --  notvery much , Charles was glad to notice . She made no comment to Charles until they reached the corridor , then she asked him in a low voice , " Would you really have whipped her if she had n't stopped crying ? " " Would you have forgiven me if I had whipped her ? " Charles demanded in return . He looked at Jane , but she kept her eyes away from him . " It is not my place to forgive ' you , " she reminded him . " You are the Superintendent of this hospital . But I think it would have killed her . " Charles felt , for once , rather pleased with himself . " Well , " he admitted ungrudgingly , " so do I , if it comes to that . But you see she would have died anyhow if I had n't risked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec , he thought to himself , could have been more startling ! It seemed to him that Jane might appropriately have thanked him , but she didn't. tion . Alcohol injections , while she was sobbing so violently , would be extremely dangerous . He laid down her wrist . How far could he startle her without killing her ? How long could she go on like this without killing herself ? Her fixed will had taken her far beyond mere desire . Even if she wanted to stop now , she could n't , unless something , from the world she had barred herself against , broke through to help her . Charles put his right arm under her shoulders . He raised her with gentleness , but his voice when he spoke cut like a knife . " If you do n't stop crying , " he said , " I 'm going to lay you across my knees and smack you till you do ! I shall count ten and then begin  --  and I shall smack hard ! " Charles wondered what he would do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sure . His hands tightenedon her shoulders . He began to count ten slowly . A long shuddering sigh broke from the woman . It seemed as if her life might go out on it . Then there was silence . Neither Charles nor Jane moved . The hiccuping began again . Charles 's muscles tightened . His injured wrist hurt like hell , but by putting the chief pressure on his right arm , he could just stand it . Once more the sobs died down . Charles bent lower over the woman and looked into her dim , angry eyes . Was she capable of thought ? He spoke quietly , as if he were speaking to a reasonable person . " Well  --  now you know what 's up , do n't you ? I dare say Dr. Everest will give you something to make you sleep . When you wake up you 'll feel quite different .

S 99 " When one sees how successful the mere threat of whippinga woman can be , " Charles said rather aggressively , " it seems almost a pity that the real thing does n't get done a great deal oftener . " He was thinking of his sister Myra ; but Jane could n't know that he was thinking of Myra . They had reached her door . Jane stood in front of it , her hand upon the door handle . She was , Charles supposed , dismissing him . After all , he had saved her patient'slife for her ! She might in return have asked him in to smoke a final pipe ! The red amber earrings sparkled fiercely against her pale cheeks . She held her small head high . She opened the door of her sitting-room without invitinghim in . " Yes , " Jane said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and your sister , seem to believe a good deal in physicalviolence . Thank you , though , for what you did for my patient . Good-night ! " Charles said : " One moment , please ! Did you recognise my sister ? " He was so angry that he felt as if he were lightning and might strike Jane dead by merely looking at her . Perhaps he gave the same impression to Jane , for she gave a queer little gasp and said : " I do n't understand  --  what do you mean by recognise ' her ? " Of course she had n't ! He 'd been a fool  --  and very nearly given Myra away into the bargain ! With anyone else he would have quite given her away , because they would have asked questions . But Jane would ask no further questions about Myra , either of him or of anyone else . " I beg your pardon , " Charles said with quick sincerity . " I thought that you were rather unfairly referring to something which I see now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jane . She still did n't ask him in ; but she gave him her hand . It was the first time that Charles had touched Jane 's hand . He held it as long as he thought she wished it held . The door shut quickly after her , and Charles stood for a moment , feeling rather lost outside it . He almost wished that he had n't stopped the woman crying. .1 1AIV , ITE WOIZLTS ioiCHAPTER XIION A disagreeable morning , which Charles knew that he was going to make more disagreeable still , he sent for the Matron . She came into his office like a pause in a hurricane . She knew what Charles had against her ; but let him beware not to unleash the tiger ! Doctors must be catered for  --  Superintendents even indulged , up to a certain point ; but the Matron always had her temper to fall back upon . Luke Armitage had trembledbefore it . Macgregor and Jane went out of their way not to rouse it . Nobody enjoyed the Matron 's temper  --  except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his chair , to give himself the fiction of ease . He found himself wondering whether  --  when the Matron took off her clothes at night  --  they did not stand upright without her . " You have been here a long time , I believe , " Charles began in what he meant to be a conciliatory manner . " Fifteen years and six months , " the Matron ejaculated , in a voice which had the timbre of a bell , startling an institution awake in the morning . " That 's a long time , " Charles courteously agreed , " and I am sure you must have learned , during it , the full value of authority in such a hospital as ours ? " The Matron 's rather untidy nostrils quivered dangerously . " No doubt I have ! " she said austerely . " I know whento put my foot down ; and when down  --  it stays down ! " " Then I am all the more surprised , " Charles suggested , " that you should so far have forgotten your duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a suitable man to be left in sole charge of the admission ward at night . The Arab was dying and needed a special . Dr. Everest had given her orders accordingly . The result of your counter-order was , as you know , most unfortunate . It exposed the patients and several members of the staff to actual danger . " Charles watched the heaving of the Matron 's massive breast anxiously . He wondered how much faster could it rise and fall , without endangering its artificial supports . It was like watching the last moments of a clam before it bursts . The Matron managed to hold herself in till Charles had finished , then the floods broke . " It 's not perhaps surprising , " she said in a rapid rush , " that the men come to me for their orders  --  however little I like it ! I do n't say anything against 1 ) r . Everest  --  let her go to you the moment you arrive with her complaints ! I know well enough what she 's after  --  though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll learn in good time  --  if you stay long enough to find out .

Why a special , when my staff 's short as it is ? Clarkson 's record is all that it ought to be , and you 've only got to look at his shoulders to see that he 's a match for any two excitables ! " Mind you , I gave no order ! Send for Clarkson if you like and let him dare to tell me to my face that I ordered him to take it on alone . I may have said to him , in passing , when he came to me , as the men will do , for well they know real authority when they see it  --  and are n't to be taken in by a flaccid pussy-cat , sneaking her way through102 1 IVAT WOIZL1Sgold medals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure , Clarkson , you look strong enough for that ward by yourself or any other ! ' A word like that may have passed my lips  --  and have been taken more seriously than it was meant . But I know  --  and no one better  --  not to give an order beyond my province . All orders in this hospital have to be written ! I wrote no order ! " The Matron gazed triumphantly at Charles . He had a feeling that , although she had n't meant anything to happenin the impulsive ward on Jane 's last night , she had envisaged the possibility . " Surely a hint from you is an order ? " he dropped gently . " Is n't it ? " The Matron bridled . " No one could be sorrier about that broken wrist than I am , Dr. Drummond , " she graciouslyobserved . " Shocked if not surprised , as I said to Sister Stanton the next morning . Of course you 're new to your job , and do n't know which are the patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , I should have thought that with Dr. Everest on the spot  --  that black Jerry might have been kept in his place ! Nothing has ever happened before my eyes , I can assure you ! Not all the while I 've been here ! If I go into a ward , the patients stay in their beds , and if they want to rave they rave under their blankets . No wonder Dr. Everest tries to bring the blame home to me . But there , I always have said  --  and I always will say  --  that to have a woman doctor in a mentalhospital is to tempt Providence ! I was glad to hear that you agreed with me . " Charles 's hand tightened on the fountain pen he was playing with . " I do n't know that I do altogether agree with you , " he found himself saying . " Dr. Everest strikes me as a most competent doctor . But her qualities have less than nothing to do with the matter in hand . I have interrogatedClarkson  --  and from his extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the ward , even after your order , I am forced to the conclusion that you refused him the assistancewhich Dr. Everest had ordered . " The Matron changed her ground . " He is new , as you say , " she admitted , " and from all I can see he is half-witted , as well as chicken-hearted ! In my opinion he should n't be in the hospital at all . But there  --  as I often used to say to Luke Armitage , you doctors are no psychologists ! " Charles made one more effort to keep his temper . " Your methods , if you will allow me to say so , " he began again , " are not my own  --  nor those , I gather , of my chief medicalcolleagues . As far as your work has to do with materialobjects , I am not finding any fault with it . It is flawless . But in a mental hospital all work depends on personality . There should be a very easy atmosphere  --  the exact opposite of any strain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of your subordinates , and I am bound to tell you that I think it would be more appreciatedin a different institution , run on more conservativelines . My idea for this hospital is the gradual introduction of freedom . I want the spirit to be that of ease and good humour , and every kind of encouragement . I want the patients to be allowed to do , in their own way , everything that it is at all feasible for them to do , even if this creates more wear and tear of material things . I want greater elasticity as to time , especially as to meals . I never wish to hear of a patient 's being hurried . I am well aware that this involves harder work and great exercise of patienceon all the staff ; and far less regard for appearances . I know that you keep a very high standard of cleanliness , order , and economy , and I appreciate these things greatly . But I have a different aim ; and economy , cleanliness , and order will perhaps have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . In the long run I hope they will benefit rather104 1 1ZIVeATt ' WOOL1VSthan suffer by this new . departure . But it will be difficult for anyone to follow who has not the same aim as myself . Do I make myself clear ? " The Matron drew a loud nasal breath with an **25;2759;TOOLONG . " Clear ! " she said contemptuously . " Well  --  I wo n't say I do n't know what you mean ! I should know what a child meant if it began to destroy the furniture ! But it 's difficult to believe you 've ever run a mental hospital before , or even walked through the wards of one , with a sister besideyou to make things safe and tidy for you ! Why , I never heard of such a thing ! Freedom , indeed ! If patients could be free , they would n't be here ! And if you leave them to settle when to get up and when to eat their meals , why , they 'd never get dressed or finish a meal between daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a kind one , if there ever was one , used to say  --  and , though coarse , it was the truth , as you 'll find out for yourself before long  --  Fill their stomachs , empty their bowels , and let the rest slide ! ' It 's not my place to say these things to you , I dare say , but you 're a young man with a new job , and if you take my advice , you 'll go slowly , and listen to those who have had this hospital in their hands since you were a child , and know how to handle it . Dr. Macgregor and Dr. Everest are modern enough , Heaven knows !  --  They 're full of their krinkumkrankums ; but even they 've never gone so far as to expect the patients to have their own way ! " " I have n't got as far as that myself , " Charles admitted with a faint smile , " but I have got as far as to wish their way very slowly modified into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how this state of things can be accomplished . I have been fortunate enough to find that both my new medical colleagues share my views . If you could have seen your way to modify your methods and fall in with1 1ZIVATe WOL'DS 1o5our common aim , in spite of this one act of insubordinationto Dr. Everest , I should not be asking you to send in your resignation to the Committee . " " I sha n't do it ! " said the Matron fiercely . " Resign , indeed ! I should have thought this hospital had had enough changes by now  --  and on the wrong side ! We all have our duties , young man , and no doubt you 'll learn some of yours in time . But I think you 'll find that dismissing the matron of a hospital is n't likely to be one of them . Why , if I were to go , the whole staff would go with Inc ! If my work 's , as you say , flawless , ' that 's enough . I 'll take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any plans of yours I can  --  that 's quite a different thing . Any definite orders in this hospital that you issue , I 'll see carried out . I know my place . There never was the faintest wish of I ) r . Armitage'swhich I was n't prepared to follow blindfold , as you might say . And even Dr. Macgregor will tell you , though I have n't always seen eye to eye with him , I 've given in . Dr. Everest too  --  though God knows having a woman over my head as a doctor , who 's never treated nie like a human being once since she 's been here  --  not a cup of tea , nor a quiet chat  --  nothing but cold little words dropped out of the side of her mouth which she might be speaking to her lapdog , if she were human enough to have one  --  even she ca n't say I 've not known my business  --  and when she 's clear as to what she wants , she gets it ! I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Anything in reason you have to suggest I 'm prepared even now to listen to  --  but lunatics taking their own time over their meals , and not being brought up short to keep themselves clean  --  well , you try it ! But not in my hos-pital ! " " I have no right to dismiss you , " Charles admitted , " but I may report you to the Committee and leave them to ask for your resignation ; and that is what I shall do. 1o6 1'RIVeAT E ' WOU , 17SI asked you in this morning in order to tell you what my report was going to be . I shall give you all the credit which I think is honestly your due , but I shall say that I think your personal influence upon the hospital is not a happy one ; and that you have definitely failed to support Dr. Everest 's authority . " The storm broke . Charles , although he tried to appear as indifferent as a drifting iceberg , felt like a small boy being whipped . The Matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel physically sick . He had to hear what she thought of him , what the sisters and nurses thought of him . The very patients themselves became his accusers . Charles rose and stood silent , waiting for the storm to stop . Soon her breath must fail , or she would burst a blood-vessel . But the Matron had not quite reached her goal . There was something worse , which she had kept up her sleeve to the last . She hissed rather than spoke her final words at him . " It 's not likely , thank Heaven , seeing that your own sister 's a murderess , that you 'll stay very long in this hospitalyourself ! I found it out no later than this morning , from a friend at breakfast time , who wrote from Edinburgh . Well  --  by lunch time there wo n't be many in this hospital who have n't taken it in  --  sane or insane ! " Charles had n't expected this exposure quite so soon ; but he was never wholly unprepared for it . Sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vitals ; and on the whole he preferred the shock of it to come at unpleasant rather than at pleasant moments . He raised his head and looked at the Matron with his disgusted , burnt-out eyes . " There is no secret , " he said quietly . " My sister was publicly tried for murder and publicly acquitted . That1 IVeylT WO LDS 107you should speak of it is quite within your rights . It does not affect my work in this hospital . " " You wait and see if it does n't , " barked the Matron viciously . " We 've got scandal enough here as it is . I know well enough why I 'm being asked to resign ! You 've been got at by that slinking little harlot who calls herself a doctor ! She was Macgregor 's mistress , as the whole hospitalknows , before his marriage , if she is n't since ! A poor little thing , his wife  --  and ca n't face up to them ! I dare say you 're taking her on now  --  going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , and with all that criminal historybehind you ! Birds of a feather , as I 've always said ! I warn you that some day the very walls of the hospital will speak ! I know why I 'm leaving here  --  if I do go  --  but I sha n't be the only one who knows ! I warn you of that ! " A wave of uncontrollable anger surged through Charles . He took a sudden step forward . " Do n't you dare touch me ! " shouted the Matron . " Touch you ! " said Charles cruelly . " My good woman , no man in his senses would touch you ! But if you do n't send in your resignation to the Committee in twenty-four hours , I think you 'll find I can force you to leave this hospital ! " Charles saw her swollen , blazing face suddenly blanch . He had shaken his fist at her , without knowing what he was doing . Panting heavily , and still shouting , she rushed from the room . Charles was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , but of his own . CHAPTER XIIICHARLES looked out over the sodden , flat , unenterprising earth , and hated it . He would still have hated it had it been greener and more enterprising . The patients dotted about the hospital grounds seemed more than usually slouching and depressed . Each one carriedabout with him , as if it were visibly strapped to his back , the weight of his private hell . They were n't conscious of the weather , or of the earth 's changes . If you had put a bed of crocuses under their noses , their eyes would not have brightened . An hour ago Charles had looked out on the same scene , and at the same figures , but he had not felt that dulled sense of defeat . He had told the Matron that she could not spoil his work , but it was not true . She had already spoiled it . The objective life which was so dear to him would soon be muddied over with personal gossip . Every eye he met would judge him afresh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order he gave would be accepted differentlybecause of it . Worst of all , he would give his own orders differently because he was Myra 's brother . He was not handicapped by his affection for her . If it had n't been for his mother , Charles was inclined to think he would have let Myra hang . The whole point of the thing had fallen rather flat , for Charles 's mother had died a few months after the trial was over . The memory of his mother 's death brought Charles 's mind to an abrupt stop , as if he were pulling up a horse on the verge of a precipice. 1 1RIVeATe WOL1S 109He had not been aware that he had walked through the hospital grounds and into the private garden of the medicalquarters . The door of Jane 's French window opened . He looked stubbornly away from it . He heard the window shut , and the gravel crunch under her feet . Her voice , close to his shoulder , sounded as if she had been running . " I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you care for a run to the sea ? " Charles would n't even turn his head to look at Jane , he was so disgusted with her forwardness . She must know as well as he did that all invitations or advances must come from her superior officer . He would refuse in such a way that she would never dare to make such a suggestion again . " Thanks , " he said icily , " I 'll come . " A moment later they were seated side by side in Jane 's match-box of a car . The wet road leapt up at them like a wild thing ; the raw wind bit and stung their cheeks . Charles liked the feel of the wheel under his fingers , but he did n't know where he was going . At intervals he heard Jane saying , " Right ! " or " Left ! " or " Straight ahead ! " She did n't seem to mind how fast he drove . One moment there was the dulled light of the open road , a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards them . The shallow fields were wet and sodden , the hills cut off by mist . Road signs jerked faint warnings into his mind and out again . The sun came out suddenly and fell upon the sea . High cliffs jutted forward on either side of the gap into broken water . The sea was the colour of a rusty apple , except where the cloud shadows made pools of purple and amethyst . Shafts of light from the drifting moisture filled the horizon with dim gold . IIo 1 1IV.4Te WOL DS 1 IVeAT  --  WO LT S IIICharles pulled up , because he could n't very well drive on into the sea . They got out and walked in silence up the nearest cliff . Charles could hear Jane 's clothes flapping against her figure like taut sails . The wind , and the sharp laughter of the gulls , filled the air with hurrying , intermittent sounds . Below them the sea hammered at the rocks . Edges of flying foam , caught by the sun , ran like broken rainbowsalong the ridges of oncoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked sheer down a wall of slate-black rock to a tiny cove . The dark water rose and fell with a curious smooth solidity against its side . At the entrance to the cove the waves leapt upward , like desperate fingers snatching at the sky , to sink back discouragedinto the wind-flattened sea . Gulls beat up against the wind , tacking and veering with consummate skill . Charles 's eyes followed wistfully the reckless ease of their flight . They made the wind carry them , hanging for a moment as motionless as if they grew upon a tree , and then with the slight shift of a wing , their bodies glistening like silver lightning , they plunged into the sea . Charles 's heart plunged with them . By a tremendous effort he held his body back . Sorrow was upon him  --  the wild , clutching sorrow of his mother 's death , which even now , after three years without her , could throw him into the Deep , as lightly as the ironstone rock threw off the foam of a breaking wave into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles 's heart , and she still held it . There were moments when Charles thought of his heart as dead under her stiffened fingers ; and others when the horror of it was that he knew his heart was still alive , and could not break away from the dead hands that wereclosed upon it . He knew now that his mother should never have held him . She , the most quietly free , the least possessiveof women , had not known how to open her hands and set him free from her dominion . She had understood him too well ; she had spared him too much ! Charles neither blamed her nor himself . Neither of them had known any better , but he realised that at her death she had taken half his life away with her . When these attacks of sorrow caught him , he had no redress . He could only let them play what havoc they liked , while his clenched will refused to act upon their mad beckoning . Suddenly he felt a hand laid on his arm . he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm and light was its pressure , but it pulled him back towards the solid earth . " You are too near the edge , sir , " Jane said quietly . " It 's all right , " Charles murmured , moving backward a step . " I 'm what guides call Schwindel-f rei . ' I hope I did n't frighten you ! " He wondered how long he had stood there forgetting Jane 's existence . From the position of the sun he thought it must be quite a long time . She was quite right , he had been too near the edge ; but it was a good thing she had not spoken sooner , becauseCharles could n't have answered her . When his sorrow rode him , his jaws locked themselves together like stone . Nor did he hear when he was spoken to . It must have been rather a terrifying experience for the poor girl . She looked white ; but she did n't ask him any questions . She only told him they were near a farm where they could get tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side , the wind beating them back , as if they were trying to breakII2 1 ' 1IVe4 WO1 ( LDSinto one of its secrets . They could n't have talked against it if they had wanted to . They came quite suddenly upon an exposed , wind-bitten little farm surrounded by stone walls . An old woman , gnarled as one of the bent trees in her tiny orchard , opened the door to them . Her daughter had been one of Jane 's patients and she could n't do enough for them . For a long time she stood there talking , in a singing whine , rather like the voice of the wind . She brought them cream , and golden butter , and honey in the honeycomb . Charles liked the sound of her voice ; but he was glad when she went . They were in a queer little room , furnished with slipperyblack horsehair , and full of sepulchral or insipid ornaments . But the fire was alight , and the tea was hot . It occurred to Charles that he would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure to tell her directly she got inside the hospital , and though he had never spoken of Myra to anyone , he had a feeling that he would prefer that Jane should know the facts from himself . " I 've had an amusing morning , " he began with grim lightness . " I was trying to dismiss the Matron , and she dismissed me instead ! But I do n't know that I am going to go ! " Jane looked at him interrogatively , and stopped eating . " She had her reasons , " Charles went on . " There 's been a scandal attached to my name , and she was lucky enough to find it out . She threatened me with exposure . It is quite a neat little case of blackmail . She did n't say that if I withdrew the charge against her she would let me off , but I presume that she would have done so . What should you advise ? " PRIVATE WOL.L1S 113Jane said rather reprovingly : " Of course you are joking , sir ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles . " On what do you base your theory of my complete innocence ? " he demanded . " You know nothing about me ! " Jane flushed a little . " There are certain rudimentary things , " she murmured , " which one knows about some people . The Matron is very foolish if she supposes she can frighten you . " " The thing the Matron knows about me , " Charles said , more gravely , " is definitely one that I should prefer kept quiet . However , it 's not going to be kept quiet , so that I thought I should rather like to tell you what it is myself . " About three years ago my sister 's husband was found dead on the stairs . He was shot through the head , and the revolver was beside him ; but there were certain indicationsthat made suicide seem unlikely . My sister was alone in the house with him at the time of this occurrence . She was accused of murder  --  and after a long and rather notorious trial she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charles paused . He looked across the table at Jane . Her curiously sensitive face looked like a landscape , shaken by a breeze . Her eyelids fluttered and her lips shook a little . She only looked hard when she had previouslydetermined not to show her feelings . Suddenly it occurred to Charles that Jane already knew about Myra , and that this was why she had dared to ask him to come out with her ! The Matron must have gone to work even sooner than he had expected . " It 's quite atrocious ! " she said quickly , " and so silly ! You must n't  --  either of you  --  give it another thought . The Matron can do no harm by talking of it  --  except to herself ! " " I think she can do harm , " Charles said slowly , " but114 1 LIVeA E WOLVSperhaps not as much as at first I thought she could . The Committee , of course , already knew of the circumstances . They had hoped it would not become generally known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me for a small part of the year . Fortunately , she prefers Continentallife . I took her abroad for two years after the trial . It suited me quite well ; I wanted to study psychology in Vienna . When I got back to London , I tried for a job there , but that did n't answer . " I was lucky enough to get a temporary post at Broadmoor ; I held the Dartford appointment for two years , but that also was too near London . I was glad when this turned up  --  so far away from everything ! You do n't think it will hurt the work then  --  everybody 's talking about us ? " Jane said : " Why ever should it ? On the contrary , I should think it might help ! " Charles stared at her fiercely . " What d' you mean ? " he asked . If she was going to dare to pity him ! Jane laughed . It was an amused , friendly little chuckle , as if she thought Charles rather a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " she said , " I dare say you do n't know it , but you are considered at the hospital to be rather too immaculate . If subordinates are to feel comfortable , their chief must have a flaw . I admit this is only a vicarious one , still perhaps it will serve . The question of your going is absurd . Do n't go ! What about the Matron  --  can you really get rid of her ? " Charles felt thoroughly relieved . He did n't want to go on talking about himself or Myra . He had n't said that Myra was innocent . He could n't lie to Jane , and acquittal sounded as good as innocent  --  except perhaps to Jane . " I think I can dismiss her , " he said thoughtfully . " I did n't act hurriedly . You see , I 've let more than a month pass since our dust-up in the ward . I made an official en-1 1RIVeATE WOLDS iiquiry immediately , but I gave no decisions about it . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods  --  ifshe could grasp them ! Nor did I wish to make a personal matter of her dismissal . But she gave me no alternative . I think she will resign , but if she does n't , and the Committee do n't dismiss her after the report I intend to send in , I shall resign myself . " " She 'll go , " Jane said quietly , but with conviction . " She 'll see that she ca n't work with you , and she wo n't want to be dismissed . Give her twenty-four hours before sending your report in  --  and she 'll resign . " " I hope , " Charles said interrogatively , " that the Macgregorswo n't mind ? I rather counted on the whole thing being over before they got back , and a fresh Matron in-stalled . " Jane did n't answer . Charles noticed that she never answeredfor Alec ; but there was perhaps an intimacy in not answering for him as great , if not greater , than if she had answered for him . Did she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come round to what she wanted ? But what did she want ? She had said to Charles : " Do n't go ! " Yet surely , as Alec 's friend , she must want Charles to go ? Why had she asked Charles to corne with her to the sea after she knew Myra 's story ? She should n't act like a friend if she was n't a friend ! And could she be both his and Alec 's friend ? " You 're late ! " said Charles , suddenly retnembering the time . " Did n't you say you 'd only got two hours ? " " Yes , " said Jane airily , as if it did n't matter . " I am rather late , I know . Dr. Barnes will just have to carry on till I get back ! " She did n't offer to let Charles drive home , and Charles saw , not without satisfaction , that Jane had a good deal to learn about driving . CHAPTER XIVEvEN if Alec had n't been happy , he would have driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour , stretching herself out to sixty on an open road . Other people had spills or perpetual repairs , they were blocked for hours behind hay-carts and lorries , but Alec , playing to his luck , generally got round obstacles before they had time to hold him up . An open road , a good car , a job of work , a chance companionship , went down , with him , as easily as a glass of milk . People with foresight handicapped this gift with anxiety . Alec took things as they came , and if they did n't come , he took somethingelse instead . He was so happy that he did n't want to talk . It was a late December day and the road stretched flat and dim towards the lilac line of hills . He wondered if frost , wood smoke , and sodden leaves had ever smelt so good to anyone before ; or if ever a flat , familiar road could hold again this dim enchantment of a dream . He did n't want to talk , and apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and he was aware of all her wants . For the last month he had eaten , slept , waked , and breathed Sally . She answered to him as the faithful little car answered to his quick brain and steady hand . If anything went wrong , she was ready to tumble out onto a muddy road and help him with it like another man . She took being benighted on a dark moor as a joke . Her love and laughter were thestops under his fingers . Alec had looked forward to his marriage for years , but he had n't known it would be as good as this . He had gone1 1IVe,1S WOLl7S 117into it full of excitement and curiosity . Another human being had had the temerity to prefer him to anyone else . But once married , he found that marriage was n't merely winning a prize . It was at once something more aloof and more intimate . He had opened the door of his heart to a fresh stream of life that ran through it , and was one with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . The symbolic act of love which bound them was transcended by this deeper union . Their short honeymoon and the rush of his work after it had but pointed the way to a new , unhampered state of being into which they had now grown . If Alec stretched out his hand , without look or speech , to Sally , she put into it at once what he wanted . If she was cold he felt the little shiver down his back . If he was hungry Sally was quick to suggestfood . When they did n't speak they were thinking to each other  --  quite as much as if they spoke out loud . To explain what they meant to each other would have seemed almost a retreat from a deeper communion . Sally , silent , was a new creative power ; Sally , speaking , was only an absurd and adorable child . She had been unawakenedwhen Alec married her , but her response to his ardour had been unruffled and complete . Alec knew that many women in love keep something back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then make you pay for it by instalments ! She gave him all she had . He was as sure of Sally as of the heats of his own heart . It was n't as if she were merely biddable or slavish either . She had her own way of brushing her teeth , for instance , and would n't change it . She was dazzlingly clean , but had n't a notion how to improve her physical appearance . She had a boy 's honour and shyness , but she was n't particularly tactful . She said what she meant , even when she had much better not say it . The city rose up round them like a flat-footed beastii8 1 1IV42 ' WOLtSwith a tough hide . It was a shoddy industrial seaport blasted by nineteenth-century ugliness ; but the dusk hid its worst features . Mysterious jewelled lights broke the unsightly shops into fantastic palaces . Alec enjoyed edging into cross-streams of traffic and picking his quick-witted way through the fumbling stupiditiesof the market town . A big square opened out of the drab flurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshortened lines , rose up , each set in its own wide grass space . The heart of the city , rebuilt since the War , was as young and beautiful as their new life together , as separate and as deeply interfused . Alec had a pride in it , and he slackened pace a little that Sally might share his pride . He was n't sorry to be back again . The steady sunshineof his personal happiness would flood him safely over the rock of Charles . He had talked a lot with Sally about Charles , and they had both agreed to push him out of their consciousness and just go on with the job . Jane had been right about it . Let Charles dither about in outhouses , sign papers , and give orders ; the minds and lives of their patients were still their own to deal with ! It suddenly occurred to Alec that it would be nicer to go straight to Jane 's for tea than to their own cold little house , which would have to be reopened and settled down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane had n't written much , only two or three curt little lines about things he had asked her to do , or cases he 'd begged for reports on . This had been all that he had wanted at the time , but he was conscious now that he could n't hear quickly enough what had been happening to the hospital . " Sally , " he said to the Double Consciousness beside him , " let 's run in to Jane 's for tea . " 1 IVeATE WO1ZLDS 119He was instantly aware of a change . The consciousness ran single . Sally said : " Oh  --  do you want to , Alec ? " It was almost as if she had said " I do n't ! " A sharp thrill of annoyance passed through Alec . The pleasant prospect of Jane 's room became an irritating need . " Well  --  why should n't we ? " he asked impatiently . " She 'll be expecting us . We 've got to get our house open  --  and get tea ourselves , and all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't leave a thing like a hospital in a strange man 's hands for a month and not find changes . Of course I shall hate whatever he 's done , but I 'd like to know what it is ! " " Well , if you 'd hate it , " Sally quite reasonably suggested , " could n't we put off hearing about it till after tea ? It 'll be such fun opening house together and getting our own tea . I awfully want to see Jane , too , but we can run in later . It 's horrid to have to start hating directly we get back ! " Before his marriage Alec had always done what he liked without a moment 's hesitation . He had often not particularly liked it after he 'd done it , but he had felt no constraint which was n't common to mankind . He had n't had to stay away from tea with Jane , whom he had n't seen for over a month , in order to have tea with a girl who had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He said , directly the jagged edge of this thought struck him , " I want to go to tea with Jane ! " Sally answered quickly  --  but not quite quickly enough  --  " Then of course we will ! " The silence that settled down between them both beneath the friendly noises of the car was quite a different silence . To begin with , they no longer shared it . Sally had120 1 1IVeAT ' ' WOLDS 1 MVf1TS WO1ZL1T S 121turned away . When they drew up , she got out of the car with less than her usual lightness . A moment later she was in Jane 's arms . At any rate , she seemed happy enough then . Jane 's room was just as Alec had been thinking of it . Quantities of small yellow chrysanthemums against warm ivory walls , a bright fire burning ; their tea spread out in front of it ; hot muffins , savoury sandwiches , a great open jar of Tiptree jam . Jane wore her yellow dress and red amber beads . Her eyes sparkled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave him that quick firm grasp of her hand which he had been waiting for . But she would n't answer any of his questions till she 'd heard what Sally had to say about their trip . Sally did n't look a bit as if she wanted to go home now . She sat on the edge of her chair , brilliant with eagerness , pouring out pictures of what they 'd seen in Devon and Cornwall . Rocks and the sea , late gorse in flower , tumbled out of her by turns . She described how they 'd been benightedon the Quantocks ; and picked mushrooms on the cliffs of Kilve for breakfast . How they 'd sailed round Bolt Head on a sea as smooth as June , and on another day had seen a ship nearly wrecked off it , in a gale . How a strange dog had insisted on joining them for a day 's perplexing and uproarious intimacy , and then retired to its unknown home , with graceful unobtrusiveness , at night . Alec found himself re-living these ( lays with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his personalitybreak down , and the new stream of Sally run through him , swift and warm . He forgot about the hospital , and Charles . He was almost sorry when Sally checked herself at last and said : " Oh , Jane  --  tell him everything ! He 's dying to be toldtaken hers away from Alec ; and he did n't know , and did n't want to know , what Sally 's contained . His own was unpleasant enough without that . He had been cross to Sally , and she had given way to him , and let him see that she had n't liked giving way to him . What could be more exasperating than that ? Why could n't one have one 's own way and yet not be given way to ? If Sally did n't want to go to tea with Jane , why the devil should n't she go home and make her own tea ? All she had to do was to put a match to the gas stove . Of course he loved Sally to distraction , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , and get enough distraction in before dinner  --  let alone after ! The hospital buildings stood up suddenly out of the shadowy plain . It was n't dark yet , only frosty and blue . The hospital did n't really look like a prison , though of course Parkins , the lodge-keeper , had to see who you were before you went out or in . Still , after their adventures on open moors , their moss-grown mills and thatched cottages with still blooming gardens , this grey hygienic institution , set flat in unfeatured grounds , was a set-back to the imagination . If it was your work it was different . Alec liked the half-witted derelict creatures drifting about the grounds , trying their dulled wits at jobs an intelligent child of six could do better . He knew all about them ; most of them had been worse and more useless before they 'd been worked on . Alec had them all mapped out in his mind and meant to make them more useful yet . But he knew Sally could n't like them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interested in it . He began to be besieged by Sally 's thoughts . He would n't let them in , but they clamoured at the threshold of his mind . Sally said nothing . She kept her eyes rather carefully122 1 RIVeAT ' WOLDSwhat the new man 's been doing to the hospital ! And about the patients and what everybody 's been up to ! " " He looks dying ! " Jane gently jeered . " I do n't believe he 'd have minded if the hospital had been burnt down in his absence . " She did n't seem in a hurry to tell them about the new man 's behaviour . When Sally insisted , Jane said hesitatingly : " You 'll see for yourselves . He 's quite modern . I do n't think we shall find him at all obstructive to our main ideas . He 's really improved the farm . He cuts down expenses while he 's actually improving the quality of what 's being used . Naturally there 's been a certain amount of friction . People do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved away . The biggest change is that he 's parted with Matron . They clashed from the first . She tried to run him , as she 'd run Luke  --  and he would n't be run . I think you would have had the same difficulty in his place . At any rate , we all seem to have survived the parting . " At last Alec had a reason for anger ! It was almost a mercy that Charles should have given him so good a pretext . " What on earth did he do that for ? " he demanded with fury . " A perfectly good worker  --  who 's kept everything in apple-pie order for years ! He might at least have had the common decency to wait till I got back to discuss it with me ! I do n't say Matron had n't got faults  --  she was a bully and a bore  --  but we 've all got something against us . Anyhow , you could always , banteringly , bully her back , and get what you wanted . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch Express ! You might have written to me about it , Jane  --  if you could n't stop it yourself . " " I thought I would rather talk it over with you , " Jane replied , with her exasperating mildness . " There really was 1IVe2 " ' IVOL'DS 123nothing we could either of us do about it . Dr. Drummond was within his rights in sending a report on the Matron to the Committee . He told her in advance what he intended to do . She could either resign or fight it out . She chose to fight it out and the Committee acted on Dr. Drummond 's report . In the end she resigned , and they gave her so good a chit that she will have no difficulty in getting another job . Miss Sanders was made Matron in her place , and Sister Jobson has taken on the night duty . The two depu- ties were a little annoyed , but they would have been more annoyed had either been preferred to the other . There was a good deal of talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Alec let this sink in ; but he was n't satisfied , if Jane was . A perverse admiration for a woman he had never admired surged through him . He saw Charles in his mind 's eye  --  repellent , rigid  --  quite incapable of coming out of his shell to reach a big , warm-hearted termagant , who only wanted to be jollied , in order to eat out of your hand . A coarse joke or two and she doubled up and gave way at once ! Charles was no psychiatrist or he 'd have been able to get the best out of a good worker . Jane ought to have stood by the Matron even if she did n't like her ; but Jane was always so damned fastidious ! What did she mean by talk- ing as if Alec had been run by the Matron ? No woman had ever run him  --  and they were n't going to begin to now , married or not ! Alec shot a belligerent glance at Sally , who was eating her third muffin in unruffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run me ! " he said to himself savagely . Aloud he said to Jane : " Have you seen anything of the fellow 's sister ? Do they go on asking us out to full-dress parties , and all that bunkum ? " Alec had never given Myra another thought till now , I24 1 RIV AT WOL1Sbut he found that with this mention of her her image sprang , with astonishing distinctness , into his mind 's eye . Jane did n't answer his question at once . A little frown came between her arched eyebrows which made her look like a slightly bewildered pansy . She poured out more tea and cut a cake , then she said slowly : " I suppose I 'd better tell you myself  --  it 'll be the first thing you hear directly you get inside the hospital . It 's nothing at all really . That 's why it 's so tiresome . It seems that Dr. Drummond 's sister is Myra Anderson . I do n't suppose the name means anything to you  --  it did n't to me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no one except his wife in the house at the time . She was accused of murder , but acquitted . Presumably the husband committed suicide . " " Oh , but , Jane ! how frightfully thrilling ! " Sally cried . " Fancy keeping a gorgeous piece of news like that up your sleeve till it 's dragged out of you ! I always disliked her the most . But she looks so awfully like the adventuress in plays that you 'd think she could n't be one ! " " The fact of her husband 's committing suicide , " Alec chillingly broke in , " hardly seems a reason for calling his wife an adventuress . " Looking up , he caught Jane 's eyes resting upon him in astonished disapproval . " Why on earth "  --  they asked him  --  " are you being nasty to Sally ? " CHAPTER XVTo ENVY Jane would have seemed to be as silly to Alec as to envy his right hand . He had always taken the same sort of pride in her work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself wondering whether she had n't been right in thinking that he ought n't to have given up his larger share of the hospital for the men 's side . He shrank from his first visit to his new quarters . He felt driven back , even if it was only for a few minutes , into the women 's wing . Here everything was familiar to him . He knew the way windows opened and the way keys turned in locks . He could put his hand on every instrument in the spotless theatre . The nurses and the patients were built up out of his knowledge of them . It was the swift after-breakfast hour when everyone was on his mettle and hurrying to be beforehand with routine work , in case of special emergency . Alec watched a little shamefacedly how each old friend greeted him . Was he as welcome now , and as respected , as if he had come back their chief ? If a nurse hurried by him with a mere formal greeting , and did n't stop to ask him how he 'd enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleaning in the passages , deep in some incredible dream , failed to be called out of it by his eyes and voice , Alec felt as unreal and unsubstantial as the dream . When he reached the clinical room where Jane was seeingher patients , he hesitated . What right had he , after all , to go in and bother Jane ? He was due in his own wards on the men 's side . Jane would be busy . She would n't want126 PRIVATE WORLDSto see him ! The place was hers now , she 'd been running it a month ! If she 'd wanted him , she could have asked him to look in last night ! And yet was n't theirs an intimacybeyond requests or explanations ? He knocked , and Jane 's voice , cheerful and welcoming , took away part of his uneasiness . She did n't look at all surprised to see him , and she behaved as if it were still Alec 's office . " You 've just come in time , " she told him , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her good to see you . I hear she 's been tearing her clothes again . While you 're giving her a talking-to , I 'll just run through the wards . " " I have n't any business to see her , " Alec said doubtfully . " I ought to be over in my own wards . Still , if you 'd really like me to Carrie Flint was in a sense his special property . She had come in shattered to pieces ; his skill had reached her , as a searchlight from the shore reaches a ship in a furious sea . Through her black night a beam of hope had shone . Carrie was the youngest of three sisters left orphaned in early youth . They all three had high ideals and comfortableprivate means . One of the elder sisters was a famousheadmistress , the other an equally famous mountainclimber . Carrie had been a gym mistress in her eldest sister 's school , and spent her holidays climbing mountains with the second sister . But she had never been able to emulate the brains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her devotedly ; and they had dragged her onwards and upwards along the path which they had chosen for her , by the hair of her obedient head . Carrie had worked her hardest to please Isabel , and climbed her hardest to please Maud . She had failed dismally at examinations , and , by way of recreation , fallen into crevasses . Timid , adoring , ineffectual , a prey to secret resentment , Carrie had plodded on her exhausting way , untilP IVeATE WOL1S 127the inevitable collapse came . The sisters had tried all the harder to stiffen her to fresh exertion . They had poured the vitriol of moral intensity into her tired nerves , and Carrie had responded with terrific tension , until the desire to evade the ordeals which she was facing proved too strong for her . She had seen that there was only one thing she could conscientiously get out of , which would prevent her from having to face any fresh ordeals , she could go out of her mind ; and this , with extreme thoroughness , Carrie had proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind found its one solution in an attempted embrace , which turned in the moment of attainment into a ferocious bite . A knock came at the door and Carrie slid softly into the room , accompanied by her special nurse . Jane said quickly : " Now your own doctor is going to talk to you this morning , Carrie ! " and was gone . Instantly Alec 's sense of grievance left him . He forgot he was in Jane 's office , not his own . He even forgot that deeper grudge that the hospital was not his , but Charles 's . " Steady , Carrie , " he said , holding her back gently by the wrists and looking down at her with deep impersonal kindness . Carrie smiled in response , her intense sly smile , trembling with eagerness to accomplish her act of frustrated tenderness . " I hear you 've been tearing your dress again , " Alec said . " That 's a pity ! It suits you , Carrie ! You look nice in pink ! Does n't she , Nurse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fluttered avidly over the stout pink calico . She knew Alec was talking about her dress . She smiled harder , and dipped suddenly towards the hand that held her wrist , with bared teeth . Nurse Christie was just in time to draw her back . " No , you do n't ! " she said firmly , but without harshness. 128 1 1RIVeATe WO , DS 1 1 , IV4T c ' WO I L l7S 129Alec 's smile never changed . " No , " he agreed , " you must get over that little trick , Carrie  --  it 's better not to bite ! I 'm very glad to see you  --  and you too , Nurse Christie . You need n't whisper to me , Carrie ; say whatever you like from where you are ! You are better , are n't you ? " Carrie would n't speak , but she nodded . She stood there swaying and smiling , her one thought beating in her , automatically , like the rise and fall of a piston . " Yes , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She can sleep , and eat , and most of the time she 's quite good and quiet ; but not steadily quiet , if you know what I mean . " " Any work possible yet ? " Alec asked . Nurse Christie shook her head . " Keep on trying , " Alec urged . " She is n't fit for the occupational room yet , of course ; but she might do something in the ward . Carrie , I 'd like you to make me a present . Will you ? A good strong waste-paper basket is just what I need for my new office . Do you think you could make one for me , like the big one of Dr. Everest 's ? Nurse will show you how . " He threw a pellet of paper into Jane 's basket , while Carrie 's eyes followed his hand . They came back adoringly to his face , searching it with a stubborn demand for a feeling which no one had ever shown her . " She feels the change , " Nurse Christie murmured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but she does n't reach her . Miss Flint simply does n't notice if she 's there . " " That 'll come , " Alec told her . " Run along with Nurse now , Carrie ; and do n't forget , you must n't tear your pretty frock , and I 'd be very pleased with the basket ! " He watched Nurse Christie drag her gently backwards out of the room . Carrie held out her hands imploringly towards Alec , her hunted eyes fixed on him , till the door closed . It was nice of Jane to have let him see Carrie ! A feelingof restored cheerfulness and courage swept over Alec . After all , the work was the same ! He knew a lot of the men already ; and he had always been more interested in the shell-shock ward than any other in the hospital . Now he 'd see if he could n't wake up that young Endicott , who 'd been pushed out of the world at eighteen by the War , and never got back into it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then out into the grounds to look up his working patients . Everything he did deepened his interest , but he kept to the last Arnold 's occupational therapy room , which was the finest piece of work in the hospital . Arnold was an ex-patient . He had n't only been cured , he 'd come back , five years later , a thoroughly trained and competent mental teacher , the best the hospital had ever had . Jane thought there was no one to touch Arnold , and Alec shared her confidence . Charles , of course , might n't have the sense to see it , but fortunately Charles could n't do much about it either way . Things that went right could go on going right . He had only the power to alter things that went wrong . The men glanced up , casually interested , as Alec entered the room , and then turned swiftly back to their work again . But old Robson , who had n't spoken for thirty years , recognised Alec with an enthusiasm which brought his whole sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he lifted his hand in an old-fashioned salute . He listened with absorbed attention while Alec told him about his trip with Sally . Perhaps Robson had been a traveller in his youth , and the names of the places Alec had stopped at evoked scenes which made him forget the curtain he had drawn between himself and life . But after a time his eyes clouded over . Old Robson had a deep grudge against life , a very little of it went a long way with130 1 IVeAT E WOAL1S 1 1IVeA E WOL 17S 131him . He gave a vague smile , and wandered away from Alec as if he had never known him . " He knew you were coming back to-day , " Arnold explainedin a low voice . " He 's been watching for you all the morning . And now , though you might n't think it , he 's as pleased as Punch ! He went off his food for days when Dr. Everest took the other side ; in fact , I should n't have been surprised if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up sometimes , and when she told him you were going to take over , he came round and started eating again . It 's funny how the non-socials care for the one or two people they have any confidence in . It 's as if the less they have to do with human beings , the more intensely they need it ! All these fellows work better in company . They get themselves off their backs for a few hours of the day , anyhow ! Sometimes they even take an interest in each other 's jobs . There 's that little chap Green , by the window . When he first came in , he sat there crying for hours , or tried to smash up other people 's things . Now if he ca n't get his design right one way , he tries another . And you can trust him with any tool . He 's made several new patterns for himself , and taught the other patients how to do them . I would n't be surprised if you had him cured soon . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there by the small table . He 's our most troublesome patient ; a dangerous fellow , more bother than all the rest of them put together . He 's a perfectly intelligent , educated chap , but he ca n't leave anyone alone . Always trying on indecent tricks . Dr. Everest brought him in here , but he would n't work at anything , till one day she caught him watching Jackson trying to copy an old Spanish galleon , but not making much of a job of it . She said : Why do n't you try to make a ship like that , Mr. Travers ? ' and before we knew where we were , he 'd got the thing in his own hands and was making a threedeckergalleon as good as if he 'd been brought up on the Spanish Armada ! He works here all day now , and whatevertrouble he gives outside , we do n't see any more of it here ! " Alec met the hostile , impudent eyes of the pervert across the table . Funny that Jane could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really improved with Dr. Everest ? " Alec asked . The look on Arnold 's face surprised him . " Dr. Everest , " he answered Alec gravely , " is in my opinion one of the finest psychologists of our time . There is n't one of the men I 've had in this room she has n't improved one way or another ! They are n't all curable , but they 're all the better for her work among them . " Alec said nothing . He had never thought of Jane as a great doctor . He relied on her judgment . I-lc trusted her accuracy ; but greatness ? He had been her chief . He had taught her most of what she knew . Generous as he was in all his feelings for her , Arnold 's words were something of a shock to him . What was there in Jane which he had n't taught her , and which perhaps he himself did n't possess ? " That 's Findlay , " Arnold said , after a pause . " That little fellow over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best worker we 've got , but he does n't get better . He 's walled himself in too much ! " Alec crossed over to the man with flying hands . He saw at a glance that he was an advanced schizophrenic , living his outer life totally at variance with his inward imaginings . As he glanced up at Alec a fixed sly smile crossed the cold mask of his face . He enjoyed having his work looked at , and admired . It gave him a reassuring feeling that he could deceive everybody all round . They thought he was making trays  --  they little knew what he was really doing with his ruthless mind ! He wanted to chain Alec's132 P IV ATe WOM , . Sattention  --  here was a new doctor he had to take in if he could ! He showed Alec his neat inlaid tray with watchful intensity . All the patients were subtilely aware of Alec . They knew he was their new doctor , and each one of them was anxious to make upon him an impression of their individual importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and made to believe their false world true ! Peter , the idiot , an enormous creature with a head the size of an apple set on his gigantic trunk , came shambling up eagerly to Alec , to show him his big rag carpet . " Peter came in here as helpless as a baby , " Arnold proudly explained , " and as fierce as a gale of wind . He could n't put his hand up to his mouth . He was thirtythreeand had never fed himself . All his life he 'd just sat over a stove in a tiny kitchen , nagged at by a nerve-driven mother . One day he half-killed her , and if he 'd had more sense he 'd have done it before ! Now he can wash , dress , and feed himself ; and he 's as good and happy as possible , unless anyone gets in the way of that precious carpet ! He might kill them then  --  by accident , as it were ; but there 's no malice in him ! That boy is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits and mishandling ; very fierce and intractable he was for a bit . Now he 's up to school standard and a very clever orthopwdic worker . Dr. Everest has got him a job to go to outside in a month or two . " Now that fellow Mason , who 's binding books , Dr Macgregor , could you have a word with him by-and-by ? He 's perfectly sane , and has been for three years , and wo n't go out ! He 's an expert chemist and his money 's getting low . He ought to get a job before it 's too late , but the mere thought of facing his life outside throws him into a panic ! " 1 1ZIVeATE WOW.LVS 133 " Send him to the office to-morrow morning , " Alec said ; " and Findlay and Travers too . Separately , of course . I ca n't talk to either of them properly here . My difficulty , you know , Arnold , is to make up my mind what we mean by sanity . When you come right down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the time , but mad as a hatter the rest ; and so are most people I know . How do you spot the dif-ference ? " Arnold smiled . " Probably you ca n't , " he agreed , " because you 've never been insane all the time . There is a difference , though ! Mason ought to leave here , because if he stays much longer he wo n't be able to live in an unadjustedworld . That 's the main difference between sanity and insanity , as I see it . Can you get on when things are n't made easy for you , because you 've got something in you that can make anything that comes along easy enough ? If not , then you 're better off here , where things are speciallyadjusted for you ! " " You mean , if I want the world my way , I 'm mad , " Alec said reflectively , " and if I 'm content to take it on its own terms , I 'm sane ? " " That 's just about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir through the room . Alec looked up quickly and saw Charles standing in the open doorway . A flash of anger so bitter that it startled him ran through Alec 's mind . Charles signalled to him in a friendly way across the room . Suddenly Alec was conscious that Travers , the pervert , knew what he was feeling . The man 's jeering , overintimateeyes slipped from one to the other of the two doctors . " That 's the new Superintendent ! " he said aloud , and laughed mockingly. 134 1 T ( IVAT E WOM , DSCharles crossed the room and held out his hand to Alec . " I did n't know you were here , " he said . " Someone told me you were over at the Farm . I hope you had a good holiday ? " Alec eyed Charles as a dog eyes a strange dog about to set foot upon his private realm . " Thanks , " he said , unsmilingly , " I had a good holiday ! " and turned his back on Charles . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersed in its tasks ; and Charles was gone . Alec felt that he could breathe more freely ; but he avoided looking at Arnold . He looked at the men instead , with different eyes . Out of the whole hospital these were the best material for cure . Alec wanted to cure them , with a fierce desire ; but as he hurried downstairs to write his belated reports , which he would have to take to Charles , he asked himself why he wanted to cure them . Was it that profound impersonalcompassion of the strong for the weak which absorbs the whole of a man 's being  --  except his self-consciousness  --  or was it that other type of desire , as keen-witted , and as driving , but far less pure , for proving to himself , before the eyes of the whole hospital , that he was a better man than Charles ? CHAPTER XVIPASSING rapidly by the gate of Charles 's garden with averted head , Alec was aware of being suddenly addressed . " Oh  --  Dr. Macgregor ! " He wheeled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Dr. Macgregor , I 'm in such trouble  --  can I speak to you ? " Myra was looking through the gate at him , as a lost soul might look at the protective security of heaven . His quick " Of course ! " leapt to meet her need . Even in the most brutal of men a knight-errant lies dormiant . It was not dormant in Alec , it was the unchecked aim of his entire life . " Not in here ! " Myra objected : " Charles might know  --  I could n't  --  he does n't understand . Is there anywhere you can take me ? " Alec considered a moment . It was four o'clock on a dull February afternoon . He was due back in the wards at five . He had a difficult theatre case to attend to , and was just dashing home for a cup of tea . Sally expected him . His house was small , and full of Sally . It seemed somehow not the place for the troubles of another woman . There was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refractory ward . This , too , seemed an unsuitable background for Myra 's trouble ; and there was the added consideration , perhaps hardly an objection , that Charles had forbidden it . If Myra had been another man , they could have just walked up and down the road ; but Myra was unsuitably dressed for a walk . She had run out of136 1 1ZIVeATe WOIL1S the house hatless , in remarkably thin shoes . Nor was she another man . The medical quarters presented themselves to Alec 's mind . Jane 's sitting-room , for instance ; but Jane would almost certainly be in there having her tea . Barnes 's sitting-room next door to Jane 's would be better still , for Barnes was on duty in the hospital and would be there till dinner . In the pale February dusk Myra 's figure had an un- substantial quality . Alec never noticed clothes , but he had a vague impression that she looked , and smelled , like a lily-of-the-valley . He could hear her quick , frightened breathing as she slipped through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anger surged up in Alec 's heart ; that brute Charles should have protected her , instead of adding to her terror ! They hurried , side by side , over the damp lawn , through the open hall door , into Barnes 's slightly dishevelled sitting-room , empty except for cigarette smoke and the slaughtered remains of the daily paper , scattered over the floor . Myra shivered . Alec lit the gas fire , turned up a shaded lamp on the desk , and pulled down the blinds . She sat huddled up in the corner of the sofa watching him . Her eyes had the quick , roving brightness of a frightened bird 's . Every now and then a fit of trembling seized her . Alec drew an armchair forward , and , sinking into it , considered her thoughtfully . He was strangely aware of her , but he did not know that she made him aware of her . The women Alec was accustomed to had no such powers , nor would they have used them if they had . They had other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things . The way to reach men , the way to handle them for her own advantage , when reached , was the only lesson which she had ever learned . 1 jVeAT  --  WOLDS 137Alec was a good psychiatrist and a friend to women , but his experience had been limited . His senses , though strong , were not easily roused , and there was therefore a borderland over which a clever woman might take him far , before he knew that he had entered it . " It 's very kind of you , " Myra murmured plaintively . " We 're strangers  --  I have no right  --  but I 'm so desperatelyunhappy ! I do n't know which way to turn ! I 've had such rotten luck ! You see , it 's happened before  --  and each time it happens I lose my nerve  --  and then I have to begin all over again  --  and I lose more nerve . You 've heard my story , perhaps ? But you do n't know it . No one can know it  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after the shot rang out ! " She stopped , gasping , pressing her hand over a heart that actually fluttered . " Tell me anything you like  --  and nothing that you do n't like , " Alec suggested . His doctor 's wits were roused , but they were no protection to him , for they turned Myra into a patient . She had been badly frightened , and he felt that he was bound to see her through her emergency . He was even tempted to believe beforehand that she had an emergency . " If Charles could only understand ! " she said in a low voice . " But I ought n't to say that . He 's my brother  --  ! He did what he could  --  ! He sacrificed a fortune for our name  --  for the honour of the family . Now that 's done , and I 'm free , as they call it , he does n't care any more . It 's natural he should resent what he 's had to do for me ; I could bear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again ! I could n't live in London ; I ca n't see my friends as I used to  --  they were his friends too  --  my  --  my husband 's  --  and they took his side . Even if they do n't think I did it , they make me responsible for his having done it . You know , perhaps  --  doctors do  --  I think  --  that no one knows the truth  --  about anyone else 's married life ? You like the138 P1ZIV 1Te 1WOL'DShusband or the wife , you take sides . Perhaps the one you like tells you his side  --  or her side . But married life is n't one side or the other , it 's something both make together  --  which is quite different . " Alec nodded . He had been married three months , and he had heard a great deal of other people 's experiences of married life , mostly poor people 's , and mostly real experiences . He knew nothing whatever about married life as Myra had lived it . He thought she put the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that she had to seem fair in order to secure Alec 's sympathies . Men never liked women who complained too drastically of other men . She drew a deep breath . " I 've started afresh three times , " she went on , " once in London , once abroad , and now  --  here . I ca n't do it again ! I 'd rather kill myself as  --  ashe did ! " " No  --  that 's poor , " Alec said sternly . " You must n't do that ! " People killing themselves , or trying to , was what he did know all about . Alec ran over in his mind the bulk of his experiences . He believed that people generally killed themselves from vanity , or out of revenge . Sometimes  --  but very rarely  --  because it was the only sane thing to do . Then they were called insane , so that they might be buried in consecrated ground . But those common-sense suicides were the exception , since common-sense usually enabled people to see some less sensational way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge . You wanted to get back on somebody who had slighted you , or , if there was nobody to feel mangled by your act , back on God for having dared to expose you to the indignity of life . You were too proud to fight  --  that was about all there was to suicide . But that did n't stop Alec 's feeling sympathy for the girl in front of him . Her motive was probably to make Charles sit up  --  and perhaps to bring herself before the eyes of the public again . She had done1 l ( lVeAT'e 1VOL17S 139that once before , and she may not have altogether dislikedit . Alec tried to be judicious about her , but it was simpler to be sorry for her . He saw that he must try to make it seem to her not too important whether she killed herself or not , and then brush away the subject and get down to an incentive which would make her want to live . " You 'll outgrow all this worry , " he said kindly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you know ; and when you come right down to it , it does n't awfully matter what other people say . They take us much more lightly than we think . Look at the way we all go on eatingour dinners  --  even after a funeral ! I-leaps of people are n't interested in newspaper drivel ; they would n't care what came out about you . We should n't , for instance  --  I mean  --  Everest  --  and ourselves and the thirsts . It 's nothing to any of us what happened to your husband . We judge people on their own merits . Of course I know you 're not used to small sets of people , you 'd naturally know the big social Bugs round here , but I doubt if they 're awfully worth knowing ! Social life is breaking up all over England now . People who find they like each other , make sets ; and that 's the best kind really . Do n't let the past worry you . It 's the dead who ought to bury their dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband chose his own way out of it . Even if you were n't happy together , there are other more sensible ways of breaking up a home , are n't there ? You are n't responsible for the way he chose ; but it would be a pity to repeat it . " Myra seemed hardly to breathe while Alec spoke . She sat with her eyes dropped , her hands clasped in her lap . Her face in the half-light was so beautiful , it took Alec 's breath away . He felt she must be innocent  --  innocent , at any rate , of any gross wrong . When he paused , she moved , like a person coming out of14o 1 IVe.4T E WORLDSa trance . She lifted her deep blue eyes to his . She was so near him that he could see her long fair lashes were darker at the tips . She had a honey-coloured freckle on her short beautifully cut nose . The modelling of her lips and chin and the long line of her throat were as delicate and cleanly carved as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered . " I 'm going to be quite frank with you , Dr. Macgregor . It is n't only the past I have to get over , it 's the future ! They wo n't stop punishingme ! It 's true I 'm young  --  I 'm only twenty-four ! I was a wife  --  and now I 'm no one 's wife . I wanted to have children  --  and I have n't got any children ! This thing that ought to be behind me is in front of me too ! It prevents my having anything  --  any love  --  any children  --  any decentfun ! And I want them ! I want them dreadfully ! I want them all the time ! Charles says I ought n't to expect it . He 's as hard as any stone . But stones can be right  --  perhaps I ought n't to expect any more  --  happiness ? " " He 's utterly wrong ! " Alec said gently . He was holdingboth her hands as he said it , though how he came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were odd hands to hold , pink and soft and supple , neither hot nor cold , but very much alive . " But men  --  men only love women when they 're happy , " she whispered . " And , oh , Alec  --  I 'm not happy ! " He murmured , " That 's nonsense , too ! " She slipped into his arms as the moon slips into a cloud . She clung to him , melted into him , and blotted out the world . The door opened and over the crushed sweetness of Myra 's slender body Alec met Jane 's startled hygienic gaze .. It was like falling headlong into a cold pool . No murderer was ever more obsessed with the longing to know how to dispose of the body than Alec was with the desire to get rid of Myra 's lively , too eloquent form . WOLDS 141It made everything much worse that Jane , after the first blank incredulity of her recognition , took no further notice of them . She did n't rush out . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellowsleeves on " Problems in Psychiatry , " and , finding it , strolled out with the book under her arm , without having uttered a word . Myra had by this time got back onto the sofa again , and broken into floods of tears . Her eyes looked enormous and brighter than ever , afterwards ; but she did n't cry very long , because Alec did n't look at all touched by her tears . He was feeling infuriated by Jane , and madly anxious to see Sally . But there would be no time to go home . He must go to the theatre in ten minutes . He had to find an abscess which was pressing on a man 's brain . His feeling for Myra became non-existent . He supposed he had taken her into his arms ! She 'd got there anyhow ! And now that she was out again , he felt no more responsible for her than a letter-box might feel , once emptied of a letter . " What on earth will happen now ? " Myra demanded , a flash of amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman doctor who came in , was n't it ? Will this go all over the hospital too ? " " Certainly not ! " Alec said rather crossly . " It will go no further than this room  --  unless you want it to . I dare say Jane will never stop despising me  --  but that 's my business  --  you 're all right . " " Oh , well , " said Myra , as if after all that was the only thing that mattered . She took a powder-puff out of her pocket and proceeded to powder her face . She looked like a well-trained kitten at work upon a spotless ruff . After she had finished , she smiled up at Alec , a mischievous , collaborating smile . " It 's all nonsense , really ! " she murmured . " But you 've cheered me up no end , and I 'm frightfully obliged to you. 142 1 IVei4T E WOL IBSI might even try to weather the storm here  --  if you 'll stand by me . Will you  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are called who dress in the cast-off clothes of Arctic explorers ? I can spare Dr. Everest . She can hate me for ever if she wants to . Is she as jealous of your wife as she is of me ? We did n't mean any harm , did we ? " Myra sprang up . She looked neither frightened nor desperate now , but marvellously full of colour . There was n't much light in the room , but all of it was on her  --  on her red hair and on her thin shell-like hands and laughinglips . " Poor Dr. Everest ! " she said . " You and Charles are both so devastatingly good-looking ! I 'll behave properly now  --  at least , I think I will ! You 're not angry with me , are you ? " Perhaps he ought to have been angry ! Alec even told himself that he was ; but the feeling he had was n't anger . It was a queer mixture of self-conscious shame and a sort of horrible eagerness . The sort of feeling a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows that he is forbidden to run after rabbits . This particular rabbit made it even harder to be a good dog , because she actively encouraged pursuit . Myra did n't want to find out if Alec were angry or not ; and apparently she took for granted that he would stand by her . Her head reached as high as his chin . She stood on tiptoe and laid hands , as light as snowflakes , on his shoulders ; then she kissed him full on the lips , a long , slow , tantalising kiss . She ran out of the room , laughing , before he had made up his mind what he was going to do about it . The light seemed to go out of the room with her , and all Alec 's eagerness . There was no sound whatever from Jane 's room on the other side of the thinly built wall . CHAPTER XVIITHE operation Alec was about to perform was difficult , uncertain , and dangerous . He had the opinion of two famous London specialists against him , taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no abscess . There was a bad psychic history and symptoms compatible with brain pressure , but which could be attributed to other sources . The case was definitelygoing to the bad , and Alec had pressed his opinion against theirs ; and Charles 's . Charles had accepted the London view that there was no abscess , and that it would , in view of the patient 's nervous condition , be dangerous to operate . " You have Jenkins and Barclay definitely against you , " Charles concluded , with his intolerable air of polite indifference . " I see no reason to doubt their competence . What does Dr. Everest think ? " Jane had backed Alec , but Alec considered that it had been a tepid backing . She had merely said : " If 1 ) r . Macgregoris right , there is a chance of saving the patient . Otherwise it seems unlikely that he can be saved ; therefore I should advise an operation . " " One objects on humanitarian grounds to useless torture , " Charles had gravely observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there . He had replied heatedly : " It wo n't be useless . I know there is an abscess . When he came in , there was still some correlation between hand and brain , and that , definitely , no longer exists . He can see a pin on the floor , but he ca n't pick it up . The pupils of the eyes are greatly144 P ' IVeAT ' WOLDS J i IVeA'T ' WO1ZL'DS 145enlarged . Jenkins and Barclay were wrong , that 's all  --  and I 'm right . " Neither Charles nor Jane made any further comment . The patient was Alec 's patient , and the responsibility of proving himself right was also Alec 's . As soon as he remembered the time , after Myra 's departure , a quavering feeling of uncertainty about the case took hold of Alec . Suppose after all he was n't right ? Jane was to assist him in the operation and Charles had insisted on giving the anesthetic himself . He was uneasy about the patient 's condition , and determined to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked Charles for this , if he could have liked him for anything . Alec found that he was already five minutes late . He tore out of the room , down the corridor , and upstairs to the theatre . Charles and Jane were already there . Sister Simmons , the theatre sister , had the patient on the table , and all Alec 's favourite instruments were picked out and ready for him . The shining room was pitilessly light and hot . Alec slipped hurriedly behind the screen , washed his hands and snatched his coat , mask , and gloves , in turn , out of the sister 's hands . Jane had n't looked at him when he came in , but , on the other hand , she had n't tried not to . She was talking soothinglyto the patient , who had already given trouble and looked as if he would give more . Charles looked up as Alec entered . His cold eyes had said as plainly as any words , " Surgeons should n't be late for operations ! " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alec thought angrily as he strode towards the table . He did n't like the look of the patient  --  a bad alcoholic  --  flaccid muscles , congested veins , a rapid pulse , andshallow breathing . Not a good subject for any anaesthetic , however light . Charles started giving the patient ethylchloride , chloroformand ether . The patient was a bad subject , and struggledviolently . He rolled back his tongue and nearly got choked by it . Charles managed the anaesthetic with extreme skill ; but he murmured , " Be as quick as you can ! " Alec felt hurried . His heart beat hard . His nerves were ruffled . He damned Charles inaudibly for a fussy , selfimportant , funking fellow . The patient kept up a perpetual thin screaming like an enraged cricket . Charles gave the signal to begin , and Alec bent over the table to make the incision . The rest of the room , and all its inmates , vanished . Nothing mattered now but the blind , inspiring search for the pocket of pus . The sharpened steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish 's fin through water  --  deep , deeper  --  how much deeper dared he cut ? The blood spurted up on either side of the blade  --  the flesh melted !  --  Ah !  --  here was a soft , treacherous spot ! He had been right ! This was the abscess , a big fellow , with the suspicion of anotherbeyond . Time fought him like an enemy . He cut through the thin wall dividing the two abscesses ; and started cleaning them both up . Charles said : " The patient does not look well ! We must try artificial respiration ! " Alec obeyed , inwardly cursing . Why could n't the fellow keep the patient 's heart going for him ? The operation was n't a light business  --  but he started massaging while Charles messed about with carbon dioxide and heart injections . They got the heart started again between them ; and Alec went back to the brain . It looked now as if they might get the fellow through , after all ! 146 P 1RIVeATE WO1ZL'DS 1 IV , 49 WORLDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbling sound . Charles said , in a low voice full of horror : " He 's off ! " Alec slipped back to the heart . He had a vague knowledge of Charles and Jane working together as if they could see into each other 's minds . But the uncertain spirit of life , discontented with its dilapidated cage , had already flown . " He 's gone , " Alec said grimly . " It 's no use slapping a dead cat ! " " Nonsense ! " Jane said sharply ; but he could tell by her voice that she knew it was n't nonsense . Charles said nothing . Alec felt rather sorry for the fellow . The job had been his  --  and he had lost it . Every drop of blood seemed drained from the set mask of his face . Only his eyes were alive , leaping and burning , like tortureddevils . Charles fought the limp piece of flesh , as if he held death in his hands and was putting an end to it . " It was a third abscess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off in a month or two , " Alec pointed out rather consolingly to Charles . Charles never looked up from his fruitless tussle ; and Jane returned to his side . She laid her hand on his arm and said gently : " It is n't any use . We have all done what we could to save him ; and as a matter of fact it would have been worse for him if we had saved him . " She spoke as if she had a right to make Charles listen to her  --  and was sure that Charles would listen . Alec stared at them with amazement . Why should Jane talk like that to a strange man who was their enemy ? Charles 's dancing , savage eyes turned towards Jane . They grew suddenly human as they met hers . They became the eyes of a beseeching child . He seemed to be imploringJane to turn time back , and give him another chance with the fellowJane 's eyes were full of some queer light that was like tenderness . They remained fixed on Charles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was giving him herself instead . Fury seized Alec . What right had Jane to look at the man in that intimate , relieving way ? He had bungled his job and lost the case  --  let him suffer for it ! Or , if this criticism was too grossly unfair , even for a man in a temper who was nevertheless a scientist , at any rate , the job had gone wrong on him , and Charles ought to face the music without any help from Jane . Alec was sorry now that he had mentioned the third abscess . He said brutally : " Well  --  it 's no good crying over spilt milk , is it ? I supposethings had better be cleaned up , had n't they ? Maclean , take the body to the mortuary . " Maclean took the body out on a stretcher . Somebody opened a window . Charles disappeared abruptly , without speaking to either of them . He had n't said a word since the patient went . " Clumsy idiot ! " Alec said in a low voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind-the-paint manner  --  and a chicken heart under it ! I was right about that abscess ! " " You are wrong about everything else ! " Jane surprisinglytold him . " Look here , " Alec found himself saying in a savage undertone , so as not to reach the sister who was clearing up the theatre . " Have you gone back on me ? Do you like the fellow  --  Jane ? It 's incredible ! You 've no right to ! You 're treating him as if he were a friend . Have you no loyalty ? " " And if he is my friend , " said Jane , in a voice so low that it hardly reached him , " he is a man of honour and a gentleman . I have a right to think and act towards him as148 PlVe/lT ' W OLDSI choose . How dare you speak of unfaithfulness to me , after what I saw this afternoon ? " " Oh , that  --  ! " said Alec contemptuously . It was childishand absurd of Jane to think seriously of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor away from it . It was a blind accident without continuity  --  a mere spontaneous combustion . But the turning of Charles 's eyes to Jane 's and her incredibleresponse to it was a serious act . You did not rely on a person in a conscious emergency unless you had come near to him already in the unconscious emergencies of the blood . A heart must be near a heart to lean on it . Obscurely Alec knew that he had a right to be angry with Jane for that mere look ; and that she was wrong to be angry with him  --  for a complete embrace . He followed her out of the theatre and downstairs to her sitting-room . She neither spoke nor looked at him , but she did not refuse him admittance . He went into her room , after her , and closed the door . The room had an odd , unfamiliar look , as if it were n't the place they had always been so happy in together . Alec sat down in his usual chair and buried his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through a storm of terror . His hunt for the abscess  --  his race with time  --  and then that harrowing defeat at the end ! He had minded the fellow 's dying , under his knife , quite as much as Charles had . After all , the man was his patient . He had never lost a case on the operatingtablebefore ; and Jane had said nothing to comfort him ! " Faithfulness be damned ! " Alec muttered , remembering the last stone she had hurled at him . " If you 're such a fool as to think I care for that flaunting little bitch  --  because I kissed her when she asked for it  --  you only show what a sex-cold ignoramus of a woman you are ! Sally would understand I meant nothing by it . And , after all , 1 IVeATE WO ( LIDS 149it 's Sally 's job whether I kiss another woman or not ! " " Exactly , " said Jane icily . " And whose job is it whether I make friends with Dr. Drummond or not ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hate the fellow ! If you hated him , do n't you know that I 'd hate him too  --  just because you did ? We 're not only friends , we 're partners  --  and he 's ousted us from our job  --  and it 's a job we care for more than for anything else on earth  --  twice as much because we 're in it togetherup to the neck ! I do n't say it 's the most intimate bond there is , but it is damned intimate all the same . Sally 's my wife  --  she is half my soul and half my body . I do n't elbow her aside for you . But you 're meat and drink to me through my work ! And you poison my meat and drink when you look at that stinking Maypole of a fellow as if you  --  as if you " Alec 's voice trailed off into silence . The words " as if you wanted to take him into your arms " stuck in his throat . He had always said exactly what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse had been open as air , and like air it had carriedall the flying seeds of their thoughts from one to the other . It did so now . Jane knew what he could n't say . She crimsoned slowly to the roots of her hair , and then slowly began to whiten . She had been standing by the mantelpiece , but now she suddenly sat down as if she felt exhaustedand at an end of her resources . When she spoke , her voice was not angry any more , but it was a little tonelessand flat . " I feel just as you do , " she said slowly , " about the bond between us . There could n't be such a bond if we did n't feel the same about it . But I do n't see that we have any right to decide questions of intimacy for each other . If I am not the same to you , you have a right to resent it . But my feelings for other men or women are my own affair  --  and yours are , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was angry  --  150 PRIVe.1 're WO1ZLVSperhaps I had no right to be  --  at what I saw this afternoon . But I was angry for Sally . However lightly you took what you did , I felt you were infringing on her rights by taking it . Why should you wish to kiss any other woman than Sally  --  since you love Sally ? " " Because I 'm human , " said Alec impatiently . " Let 's have some whisky before we go on with this ! God ! I 'm as tired as if I 'd run for miles ! I 'll get it . You stay where you are . " It was a relief moving about the room as if it belonged to him , and getting out the bottle Jane kept only for him . The glasses and the siphon were next door in the pantry . He poured out stiff whiskies for each of them . " Now we shall feel better , " he said , drinking his off . " Alcohol has its uses , in spite of that wreck upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was rather nice to Drummond over the whole business . You know I was as quick as I could be ; and I mind too  --  about losing my patient . " " My dear , I know you do ! " said Jane quietly , in her usual friendly voice . " It 's beastly to lose a patient ! But you were n't responsible . You operated like an angel . No one in the world could have done a prettier piece of work in less time . That was just it ! Dr. Drummond did his job , too , as well as it could be done . But that black spot which lurks in all bad cases was too much for him . No one was to blame  --  but he was responsible . I was very sorry for him " You overdid the sympathetic part of it , " Alec said gloomily ; but he felt less gloomy , partly because of the whisky and partly because Jane had praised him . " I resentedall that sob-stuff thrown in . Women should keep their feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . A queer little smile1 IIVeATe WOIL'DS 151played round her closed lips and her eyes danced . " Then should n't men keep their tempers out of them ? " she murmured . Alec rather reluctantly found himself smiling too . He had been in a temper , now that he came to think of it ! He quite saw Jane 's point . After all , she had a right to be sorry for that poor devil Drummond ! Alec began to feel more comfortable about the whole affair ; only he needed to clear up that secondary business of Myra , with Jane , before he could feel wholly at his ease . " It 's like this about a woman , " he said , leaning forward . " I can keep straight on my own feelings . The proof of it is that I did keep straight waiting for Sally  --  for five years . Ordinary women  --  and I suppose I only met ordinary women  --  let you keep straight . But this Myra is n't an ordinary woman . She 's not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circe . It 's her job turning you into a pig  --  and well she knows how to do it ! I 'll hand her that ! She took me by surprise this afternoon , but I see now just how the thing works  --  and she wo n't do it again in a hurry . If you were me , would you tell Sally all about it ? " Jane paused for such a long time that Alec was afraid she was going to have one of her obstinate fits and refuse to answer him . She seemed  --  sometimes  --  to think that he ought to answer himself . But finally she said in her hesitating , cool , little way : " You know what Sally would like better than I do . If you really think she would attach no value whatever to what took place this afternoon , perhaps it might be better to tell her . Men are bad hands at concealing things , and she might suspect more than what actually took place . On the other hand , if she could be upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seems a little out of152 1 MVQAT E W O 1'ZL'DSspirits since you came back , and there is no object in making her feel unhappy over a triviality you never intend to repeat . " " What a good hanging judge you 'd make , Jane ! " Alec said appreciatively . " Nobody 'd ever guess whether you wanted the prisoner done in or not ! But you 're wrong about men , they can hide a break like mine  --  much better than you think . It meant nothing to me , so Sally wo n't feel it . If it were real , I should feel bound to tell her , because then I should be feeling the thing myself , and she 'd catch it from me . Being in love 's like that  --  at least being married is ; it goes awfully far in . At the same time , part of you keeps separate , unless it gets emotionally driven . Emotion leaks through at once . " " Well  --  I 'm glad you 've got it all fixed so clearly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not in love , so that I have n't the faintest idea of what leaks through or what does n't . I merely know that on general principles people had better consume their own smoke , if they are capable of consuming it , but if some of it is liable to escape , they had much better open the whole business up . " There was nothing Alec cared to find fault with in this statement , and , as Jane seemed convinced that he was the best judge of what he thought right , he was left with the simple matter of putting his thoughts into execution . Sally must have been waiting for him in vain for tea , and would now be waiting for him , for dinner . Jane pointed this out ; and this , somehow or other , convinced Alec that he had much better not tell Sally anything . CHAPTER XVIIILYING at full length on the white fur rug and burying his head in Sally 's lap , Alec could shut out everything exceptflame-coloured castles in the fire . His overstrung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unpleasant blurred image of himself and Myra , Jane 's cold , astonished look , slipped into merciful oblivion . Sally 's lap was as soft to lie on as a bank of primroses . Her breast , when he pressed himself against it , smelt as sweet as a cowslip ball . Sally never used mysterious scents , but there was always something about her like the breath of cows or the sweetness of new mown hay . He did n't tell her any of these things . " Pig ! " he muttered , " do n't breathe down the back of my neck ! " Biscuit , Sally 's Sealyham puppy , sat half on Alec 's shoulder and half on Sally 's lap , so as to catch anything that was going on . He had been christened " Biscuit " becauseSally said it was a nice floating name to call , and Alec said that it was good for any puppy to learn that he could be both subject and object at the same time . Alec first threatened the puppy with a hard hairy fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the rival merits of five fingers to snatch at . It seemed an inexhaustiblegame , but Biscuit suddenly fell sound asleep in the middle of it , fixing the round ball of his hind-quarters firmly into the back of Alec 's neck . By-and-by Sally would get up and make the supper ; but Alec did n't want any supper just yet . He wanted to go on lying there in that warmth for ever , hearing the rain patter against the window-pane  --  and looking idly14 1 W.IVeAT e WO A.LV Sup into Sally 's grey eyes with little brown flecks in them . " Kiss me ! " he demanded . Sally leaned over and kissed him first on the lips , a long clinging kiss , and then with her eyelashes  --  a moth 's kiss  --  fluttering against his cheek , and then on his eyes , which he obligingly shut . " What did you do since I was here ? " Alec asked , suddenlyjealous of the hours which stood between them , the lonely , empty hours , in which they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves . Sally had had rather a day , she told him . She 'd first done the work of the house , then washed the car , then combed and exercised Biscuit . She 'd made scones for tea  --  but they 'd heat up for to-morrow ; and she 'd flinched at a rabbit for their supper because of its inside , and compromisedon sausages , which , though they were all insides , had n't got to be meddled with because of their nice tidy skins , and were far quicker to cook . " I liked everything in my day except the rabbit , " Sally explained . " Only I could n't help thinking I do n't know quite enough . Would it be any help to you if I learned typewriting ? " " You 'll do as you are , " Alec told her . He sat up suddenly and hugged Sally so violently that Biscuit , unjustly roused , flung himself between them in a perfect hurricaneof barks , and had to be slowly and soporifically scratched behind the ear by Sally , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , contented sigh . " I sometimes do n't know which of us is which , " he observed . " When you 're rather nicer than me , you 're you , and when I 'm nicer than myself , I 'm you . But I do n't know when you can be me without being less nice , which would be rather a pity . I meant not to tell you what happened to me this afternoon , but I think , after all , I shall . " Sally said serenely , " Of course  --  you 've got to ! " PR.IVeATE WO1ZL'DS 155He had been right in thinking that Sally would understand about Myra . Perhaps she did n't exactly like it , but , slipping his hand up against her heart , he felt its strong , even beat and was reassured . She was n't in the least angry with him . She murmured " Mormon ! " and then began quite irrationally to be annoyed with Jane . " I ca n't see , " she kept repeating , " what business it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , well , " Alec explained tolerantly , " she 's an incorruptiblefeminist  --  that 's why . You were what riled her . She said I 'd infringed on your rights . She only looked at it from the woman 's point of view . She could n't see why I 'd been bowled over . I 'm not sure she was n't kept in a glacier for forty years before she started breathing ! I do n't believe even Freud could catch a symbol out of Jane 's dreams . She does n't understand how little there is in that kind of a kiss , or how it can come on as suddenly as a shower of rain , and dry up so that it 's dusty again five minutes after ! She might have known the woman did n't mean anything to me ! " " I 've read a lot about Myra , " Sally said , a little pensively . " The new Matron gave me a letter from the old one , full of clippings and photographs . One was of their Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of Dr. Drummond in kilts ; and heaps and heaps of Myra herself . Would you like to see them ? " " Not the least ! " Alec murmured . " But tell me about the trial . Did it seem as if the husband had shot himself by accident or on purpose ? And did it ever come out why he 'd wanted to ? " " Not exactly , " Sally said slowly . " But it did n't look like an accident . Nor as if he had shot himself at all . It really looked as if somebody else had shot him . Only it could n't have been anyone else . Myra was the only other person in the house till Dr. Drummond came . " 156 1 lUVeA WOIZLtDSA coal dropped from the heart of the fire with a startlingcrash . Biscuit jumped up and yelped .

Surely it was the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a short pause , " could n't have done it . He lived too far away . She telephoned to him , but he did n't get there till after the man was dead . It was eleven o'clock at night . The servants were out , and the doors were locked . The husband lay halfway up the stairs and the revolver as if he had dropped it . But the wound was in a funny place for a man to shoot himself . Still it looked as if he must have done it , because there were only his finger-prints on the revolver . But they might have been rubbed off , and then the revolver put back into his hand when he was dead . The judge summed up rather against Myra , but she got off .

It came out in the trial that she was unfaithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little pauses , and Alec could see it all quite plainly in his mind . " I can readily believe that she was unfaithful , " he said grimly . Small flames flickered , sinister and unsubstantial , in and out of the red-hot cavern in the fire . Alec seemed to see again close to his eyes the red-gold of Myra 's hair . " It 's curious , " he went on slowly . " I ca n't help feeling sorry for her . Yet in a way to drive a man to suicide is a sort of murder . She says she feels chased , and people keepingon finding out who she is and boycotting her . Of course , if she 's innocent , that 's pretty rough justice . I could see she was really upset this afternoon  --  she was n't fooling me over that . She looked like a cornered animal . " 1 1RIVeAT WOLVS ISM " I suppose you would know about a person 's being upset , " Sally agreed thoughtfully . " But I ca n't feel sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband  --  or her brother  --  perhaps other men , too , who have got the worst of it , never quite her . " " You ca n't be sure of that , " Alec said , frowning a little , " because we do n't know what the worst of a thing is . They have n't had to be her . " " But she makes nice people behave badly , " Sally persistedsoftly ; " and nice people do n't like behaving badly  --  whereas she seems to enjoy it . So I do rather think they have the worst of it . " " Nonsense ! " Alec said brusquely . " You do n't know that her husband was nice ! Drummond certainly is n't . And as for behaving badly this afternoon , I do n't know that I did particularly . " " Oh  --  well ! " Sally murmured with a rueful little laugh , " I hope you do n't think you behaved particularly well ! " Alec considered this statement rather irritably . It seemed as if a trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had n't meant to kiss Myra , so that the kiss did n't matter ; and if it did n't matter , it could n't have been wrong . He tried this form of reasoning very carefully over in his own mind before presenting it to Sally . But women , when they argue , never seem to go on where men leave off . Sally started up a fresh hare immediately . " She made you do it , whether you meant to or not ! " she asserted . " And that 's the way she may have made her husbandshoot himself  --  if he did actually do it himself , " she even more exasperatingly added . " That man Drummond , " Alec asserted , after taking the precaution to slide the complete puppy into Sally 's lap and then sitting bolt upright , " has the face and mannerof a murderer ! I should like to be sure of the times in the business . Nothing is so easy to fake , if there aren'ti8 1 1 I V eA T E W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time . People lie about it every day of their lives when nothing more hangs by it than not being late for a meal . " " I wonder why you hate Dr. Drummond so , " Sally irrelevantlyremarked . " I ca n't help thinking he 's rather nice sometimes . You 've no idea how different his eyes look when he 's interested about where roads lead to ; and he was awfully kind to me this morning when Biscuit got into the hyacinths by the south wall . They do snap off so , those Roman ones . He only said Dogs will ! ' " " Anyone would be kind to you ! " Alec murmured fondly ; " even I seldom wish to put you to death by torture ! Let 's get supper  --  and go to bed . You can take my word for it , that man is a beast of beasts ! Jane says he gave the anaesthetic all right this afternoon , but I 'm not so sure myself . The patient went out meant to tell Sally about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started having a baby , and sudden deaths on operating-tables were n't quite the subjects for her . Still , now he had started on it , Alec told her everything , except the way that Jane had looked at Charles . " Of course , Codgers had laid this up for himself , " Alec in common fairness explained to Sally . " No perpetual tippler is safe on an operating-table . But Drummond went to pieces afterwards ; and a man who ca n't lose without making an ass of himself has n't got the right stuff in him . I hate a bad loser . " Sally wound her small hand in and out of Alec 's long fine fingers . It was a soothing performance , but it would have been more soothing still if Sally had agreed that she hated a bad loser too . She said , after a long pause , with her head bent over Biscuit so that Alec could only see its feathery golden top : P117,4T AV OLDS 159 " Perhaps he 's had rather a rotten time too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job to take his sister abroad ; and in the papers it said Myra 's husband was his best friend . " " He did stand by her , no doubt , " Alec admitted grudgingly , " to save the family name . No one wants to have his sister hanged ; but he 's obviously let her down since . Do n't you remember how he would n't even let her see over the hospital ? A piece of petty tyranny ! The poor girl 's got to have some interests . " Alec paused . He wished Sally would say , " Of course ! I 'll take her out in the car ! " or , " I 'll have her over to tea , and get up a Bridge four . " But Sally did n't seem to catch the silent pressure he laid upon her heart . He could n't exactly ask for it , because of that damned kiss ! Sally carefully transferred Biscuit , now so deep asleep that he merely twitched , into the heart of the rug . Alec helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sally said : " Perhaps he thought she ought n't to see people like that . I went over this afternoon , to give Matron back the clippings . On the way back through the garden little Miss Flint ran up to me . She seemed so glad to see me . She took hold of my arm , trembling all over , to tell me something , I think ; but Nurse Christie dragged her away . Have they got to be unkind to the patients ? " Alec hesitated . How on earth had Miss Flint got into the big garden ? Of course there was no need to tell Sally , but if Nurse Christie had n't dragged her away , Sally would have got badly bitten . It made him feel rather sick to think of it . " They are n't unkind , " he said shortly . " Miss Flint should n't have been there . I do n't mind your going into the hospital to see Jane , or Matron , and going through the big garden to do it , but Drummond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people all over the16o 1 1ZIV4TE WO1ZLI7S 1 RIVeA E WO1RLDS 161place , without supervision . It is n't good for the patients , and might result in unpleasantness all round . Going over the hospital , with one of the staff under proper conditions , is quite another thing . But a pop-eyed reactionary like Drummond just forbids for the sake of forbidding . " This settled the matter . Sally went into the kitchen and cooked the sausages , and Alec mixed a masterly salad . They had Heinz 's tomato soup first with cream in it , and wound up with bananas . Sally was just as jolly as usual , and they talked about the car , and whether they should buy a piano , and keep chickens . Before they had finished supper , they had made the chickens pay for the piano . While they were washing up , they found they could afford to go to the Riviera in the car for their summer holiday . They liked travelling better than anything , and could sleep in a tent to save hotels . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . The stars were out , and had a friendly look  --  high up in the dark , windy sky . The air smelt astonishinglysweet . It was rather marvellous , walking about with his own wife on his arm , and his own dog putting up imaginary cats and rabbits to divert them from noticing that he was not carrying out the last duties of the night . A bath in the new bathroom which had pale blue dolphinson pearl-coloured tiles , soothed away the last of Alec 's discontent . Sally had undressed and was already in bed when he came into the room . She held out her arms to him smiling . The whole black day was dead . Sally , all gold and pink and white , with laughing eyes , filled up the universe . Alec was glad , as only a doctor could be glad , that she was such a normal , healthy girl . Her body was compact and firm ; she showed none of that fluttered maternal tenderness , always a little tenacious and timid , which is allsome women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride who knows that she is her husband 's world and gives it to him afresh with a satisfaction more overwhelming than generosity . To-night Sally must have been more tired than usual , for she was the first to fall asleep . Alec lay motionless beside her , her head upon his breast ; and then the day came back . But it came back differently . He saw that it had been despicable to yield to Myra , that he had been unfair to Charles , unjust to Jane , and extraordinarilyslack to go late to a dangerous operation . He realised how nearly his hand had slipped on the knife . Even if Charles had bungled the anesthetic , he had no real grounds for judging him for it . IIe himself had kept the patient waiting , and perhaps added to the strain on his heart by doing so . It was true that he had been right about the abscess , but perhaps Charles had been right to fear the operation because of the man 's alcoholic condition . Had n't Alec only pressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the dark , with Sally 's soft sweet breathing close to his ear , Alec faced up to himself . he might have been responsible for his patient 's death . He had a wife he loved and should not desire another woman 's kisses . Ile was a friend , and should n't grudge Jane 's right to oilier intimacies . Thank God , anyhow , that he 'd told Charles about that third abscess ! He made most excellent resolutions before he went to sleep . He would avoid Myra . He would be decent to Charles . Perhaps Jane had n't meant anything by that look . She may only have wished , by being nice to Charles , to introduce the spirit of greater friendliness all round . If more of the same stuff came up again , he would reason with her , but not scold . They would both take the greatest possible care of Sally. 162 1 IVeAT e WOlL1SA bright March moon came striding up the sky . Sally stirred in her sleep , under its sudden light , and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their new furniture in the room . They were all new and beautiful things , safe as his young love . The moon , sucked under by passing clouds , vanished . The room rose black against his eyes . His beautiful new things were still there , but he could no longer see them . He had a sinister sensation , as if oblivion had laid hold of him . Then the warm weight of Sally against his breast revived him . She was alive , and more substantial than the moon , with all its light . CHAPTER XIXPLANS carried out alone , when you have meant to carry them out with someone else , have a mournful , second-hand feeling . Sally had prepared regal food for their picnic . The early spring day was warm and clear ; one of those days , dropped ahead of summer after a long hard winter , which keep hope alive . Sally had washed Biscuit and put on a new trousseau frock which was the colour of her hair and had no sleeves . She had n't liked the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice explaining that Myra Andersonhad a splitting toothache . Myra was afraid of the local dentist and wanted Alec to take her to Gloucester . Charles had had to go off somewhere on a private consultation . There was apparently no one else to take Myra and she was n't fit to drive herself . Did Sally mind if Alec drove her to Gloucester ? How could you over a telephone mind about somebody else 's toothache ? Face to face you could say , " Why ca n't she go to a local dentist ? " or , " If she ca n't drive her own car , why does n't she hire a chauffeur ? " Sally thought of both these things before she said in a small , subdued voice , " Of course , if you think you must ! " Alec answered eagerly  --  rather too eagerly : " Well , honestly I do n't think there is anything else to do ! I 'm awfully sorry about the picnic ! But we can go another day , ca n't we ? " Then he rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had cut the sandwiches and told everybody she was going on a picnic ; and she felt that she would rather go4r164 1 IVeAT  --  WOLVS 1IVeAT'L ' WO1'ZL DS 165alone with Biscuit than explain to anyone else why Alec had n't come . She took the car neatly out of the garage and drove carefully through the traffic-choked intricacies of the small Welsh town . At last she was out on the broad , comparativelyempty road , and could just sit still and let the world fly past her ! A special early light spread over the landscape  --  not very strong and transparent  --  like a thin golden veil ; high green hedges slipped into fields , and fields into a pale blue sky . Little spires and cross-beamed cottages sprang solidly before her eyes and reeled themselves off into nothingness . Castles climbed distant hills in a blue mist ; a white and silver river leapt and curved , in and out of emerald-green meadows . Sally drew up at last at a village with an unpronounceablename , where they had planned to leave the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun was hot overhead . The air had grown heavy ; everything smelt piercingly sweet . The new green of the trees had a bright , sticky look , and flowers in the thick hedges broke into small explosions of colour . Sally fastened her rucksack on her back and started off sturdily . As she trudged on , the hilltop became evasive , and the nearer she got to it , the farther it moved away . When she was really near , the summit melted off altogetherinto a soft woolly cloud . Between the rounded breasts of two small hills she came upon a grove of young oaks leading downwards into a beechwood . It was very quiet under the trees . You could hear birds stirring in the branches and a vague hum of insects , and far away the little crash and chuckle of a stream . But these were drowsy sounds , as if the day were half asleep and whispering to itself . Sally stopped short . To have gone on would have been like putting her foot upon the sky . Bluebells flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pierced the darkness of the wood like wandering flames . Sally 's eyes sank into them bewildered , but at rest , for their colour had no harshness in it and no monotony . Each flower carried its blue light , a little above the ground . No wind reached them . They lay as still and untroubledas a mountain lake , but their blue was a lighter , more evanescent quality than water . Softly they melted into this green background like smoke rising from some deep , hidden fire , within the slumbering earth . Sally sank entranced onto the nearest bank . A sweetnessbreathed from the army of flowers , and grew more piercing as the day drew on . Sally 's head bent lower and lower . She felt as if she were being drowned in bluebells . It was a beautiful but lonely feeling . When Sally was a child at home , she had liked being alone , because then no one could remind her that she had a hole in her stocking or was biting her nails ; but since she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had n't mattered Alec 's being at work all day , because she spent her time preparing for his return . All that she did was permeated by Alec . The garden , the house , the car , were all parts of him . But this beauty which lay spread out before her now was a separate thing . It belonged to her , but it did n't belong to Alec . It made her feel as if she were a ghost . A strange terror seized her . Suppose site was n't going to be happy , after all ? Suppose that there were worse things than being bullied and ordered about at home ? Suppose that this great triumphant wave of love , mountinghigher and higher day by day , could topple you overi66 1 1ZIV1TE WORLDSsuddenly into a hollow , out of which you could never climb ? Suppose that the crest of happiness was always bound to break ? Sally 's mind ran back feverishly over the last few weeks . Nothing dreadful had happened . Had there been an **25;2786;TOOLONG of joy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed herself . They had gone over to Jane 's , after eating rather hurriedly a dinner it had taken Sally hours to prepare . They had talked and talked till far into the night ; but Sally had n't talked ; she had n't , after a while , even listened . It was all so technical , and when not technical rather frightening , a sort of blithe handling of terrific things . Sally would n't have minded so much if behind the things they had talked about there had been the protection of a God . But Alec and Jane dispensed with His protection . If they were religious at all , they were religious only about facts . They were at work upon a gland experiment which would help them to get a certain physical reaction from manic depressives . Alec and Jane believed it would work one way , and the Hursts , who had to be rung up about it and came over , said they believed it would work another way ; and Charles , who happened to drop in , believed it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Alec and Charles were on edge with each other the whole time , but they went on arguing and arguing . Sally could n't keep her eyes open , and had fallen asleep at last , with her head on Biscuit 's warm oblivious body . Biscuit had seen from the first that sleep was the only possible solution for a dull evening . When they woke her up to go home , they were still arguing , and still enjoying themselves , though they hadn't1 1WIVAT WO LDS 167settled anything . It had made her feel on a par with Biscuit . She looked up resentfully to find him ; but he had ( lashed off in search of rabbits . She could hear in the distance his short , explosive barks . The wood was n't preserved , so even if he caught a rabbit , which was unlikely , it would n't really matter . Some women would n't care so much about dogs . If they were alone , they would comfort themselves by thinking about the babies they were going to have ! Sally tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak one . It was n't really a baby yet , it was more of a threat . . . When she appealed to the silent life within her , all it could tell her was : " Six months from now you wo n't be able to do things with Alec . Quite soon you 'll begin to look horrid . All this summer  --  your first summer together  --  I will lie a hot and heavy weight against your heart ! " " I do n't want to have a baby ! " Sally said defiantly out loud to a shocked squirrel , who festooned himself swiftly away from anything so unnatural . Sally 's eyes sank back helplessly into the cloud of blue ! If you had to have new life at all , why could n't it be blown over you  --  like the light was blown over these easy flowers ? How delicious to push through a green sheath , out of soft earth , to meet the sun ! Ah ! to lose oneself , to pass for ever away from pain and fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human cage ! Sally gave a little trapped cry ; and buried her face in her hands . " Have you hurt yourself ? " a grave voice asked her . She looked up , dazzled and confused , and saw Charles Drummond standing above her on the sun-chequered path . Hatless , with his gold hair caught by the sun , hei68 1 1ZIV12 ' WOL'DSlooked like the god of spring . Sally could n't at once collecther wits to answer him . He seemed to guess that Sally felt shy , for he began to explain to her , rather elaborately , how he came to be there . After Charles had finished his consultation , someone had told him about the bluebells , and he had walked up into the hills to see them . Biscuit , hearing a strange man 's voice , tore through the wood , scattering a thousand tiny intrigues in his wake , and panting so loudly that Sally could n't hear herself speak . She just went on looking at Charles . She felt like a trapped rabbit , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap . He would have to do it without her asking him , for she found now that she had no voice at all . She was feeling very odd , and light-headed from the heat , and from having forgotten to eat her lunch . She did n't exactly want to faint , but she felt sick and shivery , and quite suddenly the golden light moving to and fro over the oak leaves flickered  --  andwent out . The next thing she knew she was lying quite flat with her head against Charles 's knee , and finding water on her face and hands . Charles said , " You 're all right , but do n't bother to talk just yet . " The bluebells streamed above her , so that she might have been quite pleasantly lying at the bottom of the sea . By and by Charles said : " That rucksack looks as if there might be something in it ! " and opening it , he discovered the regal lunch . Charles began to feed Sally with it , and she was surprised to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and wondered if she did n't look awful . Bits of stick and insects had got caught in her hair , 1 1IVeA  --  ' WOLVS 169and her nose must be a shiny mess . She wondered if Charles thought girls ought n't to tidy themselves up in public when they needed it , or hoped that they would ? You could n't tell with the very nicest men which way their niceness would take them . Charles was n't looking at Sally . His eyes were fixed upon the bluebells . Perhaps he wanted to be drowned in them too . Sally took out a powder-puff and a glass and swiftly tidied herself up . She looked much better now , even if he did disapprove ; but she would n't risk her lipstick . " You seem to have got a long way from home , " Charles observed conversationally , but not at all as if he wanted to know why Sally had come there all by herself . " Well , of course , " Sally replied defensively , " I did n't plan to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec could n't come too . " She suppressed Myra , partly because Charles might n't like to know about it , and partly because Alec and Myra might n't like to have it told . There was no harm in it , of course , but if you said things with a shaky voice , they sounded more important than they really were . Suddenly , because Charles looked so awfully like a doctor , because she 'd fainted on his knee and he 'd brought her round and fed her as if she were a baby , Sally found herself saying : " I did cry out ! I was afraid ! In a sort of flash it came over me that I did n't want to have a baby . I 'm going to , you know , and I do really want to  --  but not just yet . You see , it rather breaks things up  --  the first year you 're married , does n't it ? " " Oh , yes , " Charles said quickly , " I should quite think one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from another point of view , one rather likes the idea , you know . It 's the creative principle which appeals to one . If what draws people together is a good sound emotion , it ought17o 1 IVeATE WOLVS ! 1 RIVeATe WOIZL'DS I71I find that men pay far too highly for women , and resent them accordingly . You do n't mind my talking quite frankly , do you ? Every special case has its own background , and it 's rather important in looking for a solution to take in backgrounds . Women are not in any way to blame for the present state of things , and it 's uncommonly hard luck on them that their jobs have been so curtailed . Perhaps they do the best they can for both sexes , by trying to fit themselves for economic independence and cultivatingtheir sport instinct , so as to make themselves better play-fellows . " On the other hand , one grudges them independence , when it is very seldom economic , and when they usually show quite plainly that they do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects to the fact that many of them are obviously out for getting men to support them  --  and then cheat their supporters ! You do n't seem to fall into either of these categories . If I may say so , you seem to me to have made a perfectly fair contribution towards your married life . You are going to have a child , and you run your home practically unaided ; you work in your garden and look after your car . Nor have I ever seen a man look more satisfied with married life than your husbandlooks . It seems to me that intellectual conversation and games play quite a subsidiary part in most married lives . I should n't bother about them at all , i f I were you . " Sally blushed , but she felt reassured . After all , Alec did look happy ! He had put on a stone in weight since their marriage , and she knew it would cost him far more than her keep to get his house , car , and garden looked after as she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " she explained to Charles . " I was the youngest , and I never did things as well as the others did , but I do try to do the best I canto create something out of itself  --  with a separate life  --  ought n't it ? " " P'r'aps , " Sally rather reluctantly acknowledged . " But you see , when all you can be to a man is a sort of play-comrade to run round with him , and you ca n't run round , and when he rather likes the way you look , and you know you 've got to look horrid , you mind rather ! I 'm not intellectual , you know ; I 'm no real companion to Alec . I 'm just  --  well , I 'm just his wife . " She had n't meant to say any of this , not even to Jane  --  perhaps specially not to Jane  --  but it came out now with a rush ; and after she had said it , she felt a great relief . For quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned rather stiffly away from her , saying nothing at all . " May I smoke ? " he asked her , at last . And after anotherlong pause , while he was filling his pipe and getting it to draw properly , he took up what Sally had said , but not as if it were Sally he was talking about , rather as if they were both talking , at a convenient distance , about some abstract thing . " This question of what men and women are to each other  --  or ought to be  --  is still awfully unsolved , " he murmured . " Apparently the old idea was that you paid for  --  and therefore possessed  --  a not uncongenial chattel , who in most cases kept her position as a chattel . Your wife bore children and did a great deal of useful work about the house . Houses themselves were , of course , far more important in those days . A wife was distinctly worth her keep , and valued as such . Now we ca n't afford a whole string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to run . This leaves women rather unoccupied and restless and greatly lessens their value to man . It 's a transitional stage and painful for both sexes . At present172 TI-Ve/17'e W ' OLDSfor Alec . Only  --  well , you see , a person like Jane could do all that I do a great deal better than I do it , and yet talk to him intellectually all the time ! " Charles said nothing at all for quite a long time , and then he murmured , so low that Sally could hardly catch what he said : " I do n't suppose there are many women  --  like Dr. Ev-erest . " " I 've never met any , " Sally loyally agreed . " It 's funny , though , that she does n't mind talking to me about quite serious things  --  like adrenal glands  --  and never laughs at me , as Alec does , for wanting to know about them . Yet she drives as well as Alec , and is nearly as good a doctor , is n't she ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think why " Sally 's voice drifted across the bluebells , and Charles did n't take up the complicatedsentence , which finished in a sigh . The air had grown cooler . The shadows turned the bluebellsinto wine-dark purple . The sun no longer set little quivering patterns on the ground under the trees . Birds sang again , and if it had n't been for Biscuit , the woods would have been still more alive . Chaffinches repeated over and over again their silvery cascade . Starlings gave long good-natured chuckles , while in and out of the foothills a cuckoo made wide circles of bell-like airy song , as cool as a waterfall . " I ca n't think why Alec does n't like you ! " Sally said suddenly ; but she wished she had n't , for Charles became a polar landscape , nothing stirred in him , and everything abruptly froze . " Your husband , " he told her with courteous finality , " was placed in a very difficult position by my appointment . It is hard for him to realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He got up . There seemed to be no question of staying1 1RIVQ/ITS WO1RLDS 173in the wood any longer , though it was the most beautiful hour for woods . They walked quickly back towards the village , and Sally thought Charles was going to drop her at the garageto find her own way home ; but when they reached it , he said hurriedly : " I am leaving my car here for repairs ; may I drive you home ? It will save my having to hire . " It was a great comfort , for Sally found herself quite extraordinarily tired . She leaned back in the seat next Charles , with Biscuit curled up like a whiting on her lap , with his tail in his mouth , while the landscape flowed past her in a blurred dream . Charles drove well and very fast , and did n't talk at all . Sometimes he asked her a question about the road and sometimes he said what he thought of anything which blocked their path . He was an irritable driver and did not suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally had grown quite kind again . Still he did n't suggest their stopping anywhere for tea . CHAPTER XXSALLY had n't expected to find Alec at home . She had told herself , giving him as much margin as possible , " Alec ca n't be home much before seven ! " She would just have time to rest a little , get dinner , and dress . She felt tired , but not tired enough to matter . With what Charles had said in her mind , about the duties of a wife , Sally cooked a remarkably good dinner , and laid the table with their best blue-and-white service . Only , when the little house was looking as immaculate as a fresh snowfall , did Sally turn her feverish attention upon herself . What should she wear to impress Alec after he had spent a day with Myra ? Sally was n't the daring type , and it would be safer not to challenge a comparison ; but it must n't be anything which would make her look too raw and young ! To be told she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could bear ! She decided on a peacock-blue crepe-de-chine pyjama suit , which had come  --  so they told her at the sale direct from Paris . It had very wide trouser legs , a narrow turned-down black collar , and a thread of a black belt . You wore black suede sandals with it , and put on plenty of lipstick . Then Sally poured lavender water all over her head ; but remembering that lavender water evaporates , she searched through all her drawers for a bottle of " Toutes les Fleurs " which someone had given her as a wedding1 1ZIV/12 ' WOL1S idspresent , and which she had meant to pass on to a bazaar . It smelt heavenly by itself , but it almost seemed as if the lavender water had n't evaporated quite enough ! Sally brushed her hair furiously for ages , and then opened the window to let the night-air hurry up the lavenderwater . There was a gale blowing in from the sea ; no moon , and no stars . It was what sailors call a " dirty night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long glass of the wardrobe , before going downstairs . She thought she looked a little too much like one of those boy-dolls which never seem quite as natural as girl ones ; but it was no use bothering about that now , for Alec was overdue . She hardly touched the stairs as she went down them , and curling herself up on the divan , she started to read a book by William James on Psychology , which Alec had recommended to her . It was certainly less frog's-leggish than most books on psychology , but her mind refused to grip even the most pungent of the clear sentences . Something was happening to the little house . It was filling , slowly but surely , to the very brim , with Fear ! Fear hung in the short orange curtains , and flickered underthe rosy lampshades . Fear creaked ominously on the empty stairs , and beckoned from the open doorways . All the window-panes were dark and hostile . It was warm enough still to have the windows open , but Sally had had to shut them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . She could n't stand hearing the whole garden whispering and shuddering with it too ! The very divan on which Sally sat  --  a black divan they had splashed into the room to give its bright colours point  --  felt as sinister as a pall drawn over a hearse ! Sally got u ) stiffly and dragged herself into the kitchen to see if the joint was done . She had to take it out of the oven and move the vegetables farther away from the fire. 176 1 IVeATE ' AV O1'ZL17SStill an hour late is n't so awfully much , Sally told herselfrather wistfully , on a sixty-mile run ! While Sally was still in the kitchen something banged furiously against the window-pane , like the blow of a drunken man 's fist . Sally 's heart leapt against her side , and Biscuit bristled and barked in an agony of sympatheticfury . Still it was probably nothing but the wind . Sally only went all over the house again , to see that every window was latched and both doors locked . She looked under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Then she took a detective story instead of William James , and went back to the black divan again . But the detective story was as difficult to grasp as William James , except when it suddenly became unpleasantly vivid and supplied Sally with objects for her unformulated fears ; and then Sally wished she had n't grasped it ! Time hung about the room as vacant and uneasy as a schoolboy on a rainy day . Biscuit refused to settle down . He sniffed and stiffened at the slightest sound ; and there were a great many slight sounds . Sally 's mind stopped making soothing excuses for them at last and began to admit their direr possibilities . Each fresh noise crept through her senses like an enemy who has found a gap in the walls of a beleaguered city . This was just the night for an escaped lunatic ! The former Matron had often told Sally hair-raising anecdotes about what lunatics would do when they got out . When Sally had repeated them to Jane , Jane had said : " I have been here five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night who should not have been there . It was a summer night and he did no harm either to himself or to anybody else , though I remember he picked all the geraniums in the front beds , which thoroughly annoyed the gardener ! " But that was like Jane . She never denied or suppressed terrible things ; she only took the stuffing out of them and1 , IV4Te WORL'DS 177made them look bloodless and dry . Still it would be a great comfort if Jane were to walk in now ! There was the telephone ; but Sally did n't like to ask her , it sounded so childish . Suppose that blow on the window was only a try-on , and the next one went through the glass and was a man 's fist , after all ? Suppose that long , shuddering movement of the orange curtains meant that someone was standing just behind them ? Biscuit broke into a shrill cascade of barks , one tumblingover the other . His hair slowly rose so that his back looked like an upturned scrubbing-brush . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched back against the wall . Her throat was dry , her eyes wide with fear ! She was too frightened even to scream . Nothing happened . Then a steady , monotonous tapping began , with regular intermissions , which just gave Sally time to breathe in between . Surely this must be the lunatic ! It was no use hoping for Alec any more . Even if he came , it would be too late ! It was only in books , and those old-fashioned ones , that rescuers came in time . But Jane was only a hundred yards away  --  at the other end of a telephone wire ! Sally put the reassuring thought away from her , with less decision . The noises upstairs became terrific . Relays of ghosts started up in the spare bedroom . Twice Biscuit , of his own accord , dashed upstairs to investigate ; and twice he came down again , churning fear in his throat . The second time Sally thought lie would never come down . He had probably been ambushed , and silently destroyed ! But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of the telephone became insistent and compulsory . If she was too frightened to try to save the life of her own puppy , she really ought to telephone to Jane ! Butr78 1 1IVe.,4T WOLVS 1 lVeATE WORLDS 179frightened . It seemed less interesting now than Charles and the bluebells . " I 'm afraid I ca n't help it , " Sally confessed guiltily , when she had finished telling Jane about her abortive picnic , " but I almost like Charles ! " " I quite do ! " Jane surprisingly announced . " Nor does there seem any good reason why any of us should n't ! " " But , " said Sally , aghast , " but , Jane -- we could n't ! It would enrage Alec so ! Think how Charles came in , and ruined everything ! All our lovely plans  --  and Alec 's work  --  and upset the whole hospital ! " " The hospital does n't seem particularly upset , " Jane remarked drily . " There have been changes , but it seems to me to be working rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can ruin it but himself . Some of our plans have had to go by the board , of course , but I ) r . Drummondinterferes with us as little as possible . In fact , he appears to share most of our theories and to support them whenever feasible . It is personally unpleasant for Alec to have to play second fiddle to a man of his own age , I know , but it is high time he got over this feeling ; and it never was Dr. Drummond 's fault . " Sally listened in shocked surprise . What Jane said might be true in a way , but it was n't what either of them ought to - feel ! Was n't there something about Charles which was all wrong , though she could n't for the moment lay her finger on it ? Alec could n't dislike anybody as much as he disliked Charles without good grounds for it ! There was that murder hanging about in the family , for instance . You could n't be very nice and have a murderess for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work very well as a defence of Alec 's reasonableness , since in that case Alec ought to dislike Myra more than he disliked Charles ? Unless he honestly believed that Charles had committed the murder ? And Sally doubted that. how was she to reach the telephone when she was so stiff with fear that she had n't been able to stir for over ten minutes ? She said : " Biscuit ! " in a hard , agonised whisper . Biscuit responded by wagging so naturally that Sally felt relieved . She managed to crawl from the divan to the telephone box ; simply because Biscuit had wagged his tail ! It was an automatic telephone , which made it easier than if she had had to ask for a number . Jane 's answering voice came to her from another world  --  cool , secure , infinitelyreassuring . Sally did n't say anything about being frightened , she only said , " Alec seems rather late ! " in a voice that barely shook . " Oh , is he ? " Jane replied with pleasant indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloucester , is n't it ? Perhaps the dentist could n't see Mrs. Andersonat once . May I bring my sewing over to you , and sit with you for a little ? I 've finished dinner . " Sally tried to make " Yes  --  do ! " sound less like " For God 's sake , come ! " She stood for a long time at the telephone after Jane 's voice had stopped , not daring to turn round . She was quite sure that the lunatic had got in , and was standing directly behind her , ready to pounce if she stirred . The huge shadow of Jerry flickered on the wall in front of her . It happened to be her own shadow , and Biscuit saved her again , by walking through it , to see what Sally was up to . Ten minutes later she heard real footsteps  --  and knew that they were Jane 's . The moment Jane came in , the whole hollow edifice of Fear collapsed ! There were no lunatics , no ghosts , no possibledisasters ! Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting one on each side of the mantelpiece , with a contented Sealyham , killing lions in his sleep , between them . Sally did n't tell Jane anything about having
