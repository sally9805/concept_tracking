txt Operators ' advisory committee of Yates oil pool , west Texas . has unanimously petitioned the Texas Railroad Commission for an order reducing allowable output or the pool to 110,000 barrels daily average from 130.000 . Order to this effect has been drawn and is awaiting action of the members of the commission . which zias invariably followed the unanimous recommendations from a pool . The order would place the lower output in effect for 60 days . Lessened takings by pipe lines serving the pool , which could cause storage and involve waste , were given as the reasons for asking for the reduction . The advisory committee reported that the petition represented unanimous action of all producers in the pool . A. short . time ago movement for reduction of output of the pool fell through because pipe lines serving the area had commitments for all the oil they were taking . It is said , however , that this condition has since changed .
