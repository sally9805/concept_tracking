 | Our Revealing Hands Condensed from the book of the same title Noel Jaquin Author of " The Hand and Disease , " etc . To the expert eye , hands are just as distinctive as faces ; they certainly tell much more . We are able to control facial expression , but we can not control the shape of our hands . But before hands can tell us very much we must study them very closely , remembering that the secret of success in hand reading is in the ability to weigh the evidence analytically , and never jump at conclusions . For instance , a hand may possess a very long little finger , indicating the power of expression , but its possessor may not be able to write ; the literary indications can be destroyed by any indications elsewhere of lack of concentration or of a weak and stupid mind . In such cases these long-fingered people would talk silly , idle chatter . To begin with the consistency of the hand , remember that if it is hard or very firm it indicates great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft , flabby-handed people drift idly on the tides of circumstance ; they dislike real physical effort , and they are generally very selfish . In shape , the hand is either broad and short or long and narrow . A broad hand indicates breadth of vision , common sense , activity and versatility as the dominant qualities . The long , narrow hand belongs more to the dreamer , the person apt to dabble in many things but to succeed in few . This thin , narrow hand indicates a strong selfish trait . Fingers are the keys to the analytical gauging of character . Short fingers always indicate a mind that is alert , quick to grasp essentials and quick to act . Shortfingered people are the organizers of the world . Their great fault is that they are impatient ; they like to deal with things in a large way and in the execution of their plans they prefer to leave the practical details to others . Long-fingered people are the more thoughtful . You will generally find them in the mental occupations : accountants , lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important . The waisted type of finger ( that is , prominent joints ) indicates ananalytical mentality . People with long waisted lingers can not be rushed into things ; they must be allowed to think things out . They are slow perhaps , but they are very sure ; t heir fault is in being too calculating Some fingers are very smooth , t he base is thick and they taper gently to the finger tips . This indicates a strong intuitive sense . T people are inclined to jump at conclusions ; they take likes and dislikes quickly ; first impressions are very vivid . Fingers that are long , smooth and thick at the base indicate an intuitive sense that tends to quicken the logical processes of r he mind . Often these people find themselves becoming hesitant and uncertain , torn between intuitive and calculative assessments . Normally a thick base shows intuition rather than thought ; in excess it indicates entire lack of , thought , marked selfishness and a sensuous tendency . This type of finger is found on the hands of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and with waisted joints indicate a curious , inquisitive mind , often very suspicious and too mindful of the affairs of other people . The next step is to examine the individual fingers . The first or index finger indicates by its length the degree of self-esteem possessed by the subject . If abnormally long , equal in length to the second finger , it indicates a domineering , proud , dogmatic person , the type who loves to rule others and would resist or resent being ruled . If , however , this finger is very much shorter than the second finger it indicates a lack of personal pride . The length of the second finger indicates the degree of intelligence and reasoning power . If squarish and heavy in build , it indicates a thoughtful mentality which is almost morbid . The length of the third finger indicates the artistic tendency of the individual ; often a desire for wealth and honor , a species of vanity . Where the finger is excessively long , practically as long as the second finger , it indicates a certain rashness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of gambling tendencies . If this finger should terminate with a spatulate formation it indicates histrionic abilities . The length of the little finger indicates the degree of tactfulness and the power of expression . If this finger is long it indicates literary ability . Those with a deficiency are inclined to be too frank and direct in their opinions . The terminations of the fingers  | are of some importance . A spatulate finger tip indicates activity and energy . The square finger tip indicates a practical , logical mind . Pointed finger tips indicate an artistic ability but a lack of practical executive ability . These pointed fingers belong to the people who always mean to do so much and who generally succeed in doing so little . The thumb is the key to the type and strength of the will , the degree of independence . It is a definite rule that lack of thumb development indicates lack of will power . One type of thumb is straight and firm ; its top joint does not bend back away from the hand . The top joint may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of thumb shows a dangerous obstinacy . These people might do anything in anger . Often opposition rouses a determination that renders them blind to reason ; they are very difficult to get on with and , under some circumstances , liable to be very dangerous . If the top joint of the thumb is firm , straight and nicely shaped , it indicates determination devoid of obstinacy . Often the second joint shows a marked waisted appearance but has a very small and thin top joint ; this shows intelligence but a lack of will power . The supple type of thumb , where the top joint bends back in an arched formation away from the hand , indicates impulsiveness . It has already been stated that thin pointed fingers , long and smooth , indicate the dreamer ; so if such a hand possesses also a definitely supple thumb it indicates a person who is capricious and entirely at the mercy of emotional impulses . These are the basic indications of the fingers , and by the use of an analytical deductive process any shape or type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important fact , which is the whole secret of human-character analysis , that the strength of the varying indications must be wighed one against the other . Every hand is full of contradictions - or apparent contradictions ; and what you have to do is to find the point of balance .
