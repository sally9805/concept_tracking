txt The largest naval appropriation bill since 1920 calling for expenditure of $457,805,261 during the next fiscal year , the construction of twentyfour new ships and 555 airplanes , and the addition of 11,677 officers and men was approved by the House today without a record vote . Just before final passage it voted overwhelmingly to bring the naval defenses up to treaty strength ' which an appropriations subcommittee said would mean recurring annual expenditures of $555,000,000 . This vote of 289 to 56 rejected a motion by Representative Sisson of New York , to send the bill back to committee with instructions to cut down the appropriation by 20 per cent . A smoothly functioning majority beat down repeated attempts of big navy opponents to hold up new ship construction until after the projected naval conference of world powers and prevent expansion of Naval Academy classes by giving to Congress members four appointments instead of three as at present . Only one material change was made in the measure on the floor . This was an amendment accepited by the committee manager of the bill to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine corps reserve . One after another nearly a dozen mutilating amendments - were rejected either by acclamation or on out-oforder rulings from the chair . The $457,805,261 appropriation for maintenance and construction during the 1935-36 fiscal year compares with the administration 's request for $485,443,847 , and the current year 's appropriation of $310,564,749 . The Appropriations subcommittee had cut in half the budget estimate of $29,380,000 for the new building program , but with assurances that if more was needed during the coming year it could be obtained by deficiency appropriation . The committee was careful to point out that it was only the " commencement money " for the program that had been halved and that even with this reduction there would be available for construction during 1936 not less than $208,000 , - 000 . The estimated cost of the new ships was placed at $197,427,000 , and it was explained that sixty-six other vessels were already being built with a PWA allotment . The new ships , all of replacement character , and the unit cost of each , is as follows : Type of Ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three destroyers over 1,500 tone 7,830,000 Twelve destroyers not over 1,500 tons 6,155,000 Six submarines . 5,647,000 The bill thus brought to 100 the number of ships either under construction or projected , the total of commissioned officers to 8,176 , and the enlisted strength to 95,000 . Of the 555 new planes authorized , 282 would be replacements . Marine corps officers would be increased by 51 , bringing the total to 1,074 . An increase of $32,356,680 for the Bureau of Aeronautics , which brought the amount at its disposal to $52,000,000 , was authorized , as was the construction of one small rigid airship to cost $70,000 . The floor fight for postponement of new ship construction pending the outcome of One next naval conference was led by Representatives Kopplemann of Connecticut and Boileau of Wisconsin . " Back in 1921 , just prior to the conference of 1922 , America spent a great many millions of dollars on ships , which were afterward scrapped , " said Mr. Kopplemann . " A similar result may eventuate from the coming conference . My amendment hopefully anticipates agreements resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building of these ships unnecessary . " We ought to go into that conference in the spirit of the good neighbor policy . If we go before that conference with the big stick of a greatly increased navy , should n't then we create a spirit of antagonism amongst those with whom we are to confer ? " Mr. Boileau had proposed an amendment striking out all provisions for increasing the naval strength , and when asked by Chairman Cary of the Appropriations subcommittee whether he would destroy the whole navy , Mr. Boileau said he would save the flagship for " good looks and parades . " His amendment was voted down , 92 to 20 , and the Kopplemann proposal was shouted down . After a lively exchange between Mr. Cary and Chairman Vinson of the Naval Affairs Committee , the House also rejected an amendment by the latter striking out a provision that line officers be not permitted to enter special educational courses qualifying them as specialists In technical staff work , Mr. Cary explained the purpose of the provision to be to start officers in special fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expert and to prevent line men spending their later years going in and out of schools . The provision was retained by an 80-to23 vote .
