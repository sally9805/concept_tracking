Harpers 01i4ffazine AFTER MANY A SUMMER A NOVEL IN FIVE PARTS  --  PART ONE BY ALDOUS HUXLEY Tr HAD all been arranged by telegram ; Jeremy Pordage was to look out for a colored chauffeur in a gray uniform with a carnation in his buttonhole ; and the colored chauffeur was to look out for a middle-aged Englishman carrying the Poetical Works of Wordsworth . In spite of the crowds at the station , they found each other without difficulty . " Mr. Stoyte 's chauffeur ? " " Mr. Pordage , sah ? " Jeremy nodded . " Welcome to Los Angeles , Mr. Pordage , sah ! I should have knowed you by your voice , Mr. Pordage , " he went on , " even without the book . " Jeremy laughed a little uncomfortably . A week in America had made him self-conscious about that voice of his . A product of Trinity College , Cambridge , ten years before the War , it was a small , fluty voice , suggestive of evensong in an English cathedral . " Where 's my porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . A few minutes later they were on their way . Cradled in the back seat of the car , out of range , he hoped , of the chauffeur 's conversation , Jeremy Pordage abandoned himself to the pleasure of merely looking . Southern California rolled past the windows ; all he had to do was to keep his eyes open . The first thing to present itself was a slum of Africans and Filipinos , Japanese and Mexicans . And what permutations and combinations of black , yellow , and brown ! What complex bastardies ! And the girls  --  how beautiful in their artificial silk ! " And Negro ladies in white muslin gowns . " His favorite line in " The Prelude . " He smiled to himself . And meanwhile the slum had given place to the tall buildings of a business district . The population took on a more Caucasian tinge . At every corner there was a drug-store . The newspaper boys were selling headlines about Franco 's drive on Barcelona . Most of the girls , as they walked along , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alt Rights Reserved . sorbed in silent prayer ; but he supposed , on second thought , it was only gum that they were thus incessantly ruminating . Gum , not God . Then suddenly the car plunged into a tunnel and emerged into another world , a vast , untidy , suburban world of filling stations and billboards , of low houses in gardens , of vacant lots and waste paper , of occasional shops and office buildings and churches  --  primitive Methodist churches built , surprisingly enough , in the style of the Cartuia at Granada , Catholic churches like Canterbury Cathedral , synagogues disguised as Hagia Sophia , Christian Science churches with pillars and pediments , like banks . It was a winter day and early in the morning ; but the sun shone brilliantly , the sky was without a cloud . The car was traveling westward and the sunshine , slanting from behind them as they advanced , lit up each building , each sky sign and billboard as though with a spotlight , as though on purpose to show the new arrival all the sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DO THINGS , GO PLACES WITH CONSOL SUPER-GAS ! AT BEVERLY PANTHEON FINE FUNERALS ARE NOT EXPENSIVE . The car sped onward , and here in the middle of a vacant lot was a restaurant in the form of a seated bulldog , the entrance between the front paws , the eyes illuminated . " Zoomorph , " Jeremy Pordage murmured to himself , and again , " zoo-morph . " He had the scholar 's taste for words . The bulldog shot back into the past . ASTROLOGY , NUMEROLOGY , PSYCHIC READINGS . DRIVE IN FOR NUTBURGERS  --  Whatever they were . STOP HERE FOR CONSOL SUPER-GAS . Surprisingly , the chauffeur stopped . " Ten gallons of Super-Super , " he ordered ; then , turning back to Jeremy , " This is our company , " he added . " Mr. Stoyte , he 's the president . " He pointed to a billboard across the street . CASH LOANS IN FIFTEEN MINUTES , Jeremy read ; CONSULT COMMUNITY SERVICE FINANCE CORPORATION . " That 's another of ours , " said the chauffeur proudly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , distorted , like a Magdalene 's , with grief , stared out of a giant billboard . BROKEN ROMANCE , proclaimed the caption . SCIENCE PROVES THAT 73 PER CENT OF ALL ADULTS HAVE HALITOSIS . IN TIME OF SORROW LET BEVERLY PANTHEON BE YOUR FRIEND . FACIALS , PERMANENTS , MANICURES . BETTY 'S BEAUTY SHOPPE . Mile after mile they went , and the suburban houses , the gas stations , the vacant lots , the churches , the shops went along with them , interminably . To right and left , between palms or pepper trees or acacias , the streets of enormous residential quarters receded to the vanishing point . CLASSY EATS . MILE HIGH CONES . JESUS SAVES . HAMBURGERS . GO TO CHURCH AND FEEL BETTER ALL THE WEEK . WHAT IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS IS GOOD FOR YOU . Another zoomorph presented itself , this time a real estate agent 's office in the form of an Egyptian sphinx .

" " You mean the Beverly Pantheon ? " The man nodded . " Finest cemetery in the world , I guess , " he said ; and added , after a moment 's pause , " Maybe you 'd like to see it . It would n't hardly be out of our way . " " That would be very nice , " said Jeremy with upperclass English graciousness . They turned to the right , sped past a Rosicrucian Temple , past two cat-anddog hospitals , past a School for Drum-Majorettes and two more advertisements of the Beverly Pantheon . As they turned to the left on Sunset Boulevard , Jeremy had a glimpse of a young woman who was doing her shopping in a hydrangea-blue strapless bathing suit , platinum curls , and a black fur jacket . Then she too was whirled back into the past . The present was a road at the foot of a line of steep hills , a road flanked by small , expensive looking shops , by restaurants , by night-clubs shuttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they too had taken their places in the irrevocable . A sign proclaimed that they were crossing the city limits of Beverly Hills . The surroundings changed . The road was flanked by the gardens of a rich residential quarter . Through trees , Jeremy saw the facades of houses , all new , almost all in good taste  - -  elegant and witty pastiches of Lutyens manor houses , of Little Trianons , of Montieellos ; light-hearted parodies of Le Corbusier 's solemn machines-forliving-in ; fantastic adaptations of Mexican haciendas , and New England farms . They turned to the right . Enormous palm trees lined the road . " That 's Harold Lloyd 's place , " said the chauffeur , indicating a kind of Boboli . " And that 's Charlie Chaplin 's . And that 's Pickfair . " The road began to mount , vertiginously . The chauffeur pointed across an intervening gulf of shadow at what seemed a Tibetan lamasery on the opposite hill . " That 's where Ginger Rogers lives . Yes , sir , " he nodded triumphantly as he twirled the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the hill . Below and behind lay the plain , with the city like a map extending indefinitely into a pink haze . The car turned a shoulder of orange rock , and there all at once , was a huge sky sign , with the words BEVERLY PANTHEON , THE PERSONALITY CEMETERY , in six-foot neon tubes and , above it , on the very crest , a full-scale reproduction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa  --  only this one did n't lean . " See that ? " said the Negro impressively . " That 's the Tower of Resurrection . Two hundred thousand dollars , that 's what it cost . Yes , sir . " He spoke with an emphatic solemnity . II An hour later they were on their way again , having seen everything . Everything . The sloping lawns , like a green oasis in the mountain desolation . The groves of trees . The tombstones in the grass . The Pets ' Cemetery , with its marble group after Landseer 's Dignity and Impudence . The Tiny Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stratford-on-Avon , complete with Shakespeare 's tomb and a twenty-four-hour service of organ music played automatically by the Perpetual Wurlitzer and broadcast by concealed loud speakers all over the cemetery . Then , leading out of the vestry , the Bride 's Apartment ( for one was married at the Tiny Church as well as buried from it ) ? the Bride 's Apartment that had just been redecorated , said the chauffeur , in the style of Norma Shearer 's boudoir in " Marie Antoinette . " And , next to the Bride 's Apartment , the exquisite black marble Vestibule of Ashes , leading to the Crematorium , where three super-modern oil-burning mortuary furnaces were always under heat and ready for any emergency . Accompanied wherever they went by the tremolos of the Perpetual Wurlitzer , they had driven next to look at the Tower of Resurrection  --  from the outside only ; for it housed the executive offices of the West Coast Cemeteries Corporation . Then the Children 's Corner with its statues of Peter Pan and the Infant Jesus , its groups of alabaster babies playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Fountain of Rainbow Music , from which there spouted simultaneously water , colored lights , and the inescapable strains of the Perpetual Wurlitzer . Then , in rapid succession , the Garden of Quiet , the Tiny Taj Mahal , the Old World Mortuary . And , reserved by the chauffeur to the last , as the final and crowning proof of his employer 's glory , the Pantheon itself . Was it possible , Jeremy asked himself , that such an object existed ? It was certainly not probable . The Beverly Pantheon lacked all verisimilitude , was something entirely beyond his powers to invent . The fact that the idea of it was now in his mind proved , therefore , that he must really have seen it . He shut his eyes against the landscape and recalled to his memory the details of that incredible reality . The external architecture , modeled on that of Boecklin 's Toteninsel . The circular vestibule . The replica of Rodin 's Le Balser , illuminated by concealed pink floodlights . The flights of black-marble stairs . The seven-storey columbarium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slab-sealed tombs . The bronze and silver urns of the cremated , like athletic trophies . The stained-glass windows after Burne-Jones . The texts inscribed on marble scrolls . The Perpetual Wurlitzer crooning on every floor . The sculpture . . . That was the hardest to believe , Jeremy reflected , behind closed eyelids . Sculpture almost as ubiquitous as the Wurlitzer . Statues wherever you turned your eyes . Hundreds of them , bought wholesale , one would guess , from some monumental masonry concern at Carrara or Pietrasanta . All nudes , all female , all exuberantly nubile . The sort of statues one would expect to see in the reception room of a high-class brothel in Rio de Janeiro . " Oh Death , " demanded a marble scroll at the entrance to every gallery , " where is thy sting ? " Mutely , but eloquently , the statues gave their reassuring reply . Statues of young ladies in nothing but a very tight belt imbedded , with Bernini-like realism , in the Parian flesh . Statues of young ladies crouching ; young ladies using MAGAZINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writhing , callipygously stooping to tie their sandals , reclining . Young ladies with doves , with panthers , with other young ladies , with upturned eyes expressive of the soul 's awakening . " / am the Resurrection and the Life , " proclaimed the scrolls . " The Lord is my shepherd ; therefore shall I want nothing . " Nothing , not even Wurlitzer , not even girls in tightly buckled belts . " Death is swallowed up in victory " ? the victory no longer of the spirit but of the body  --  the well-fed body , forever youthful , immortally athletic , indefatigably sexy . All at once the car began to descend . Below lay a great tawny plain , checkered with patches of green and dotted with white houses . On its farther side , fifteen or twenty miles away , ranges of pinkish mountains fretted the horizon . " What 's this ? " Jeremy asked . " The San Fernando Valley , " said the chauffeur . He pointed into the middle distance . " That 's where Groucho Marx has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At the bottom of the hill the car turned to the left along a wide road that ran , a ribbon of concrete and suburban buildings , through the plain . The chauffeur put on speed ; sign succeeded sign with bewildering rapidity . MALTS CABINS DINE AND DANCE AT THE CHATEAU HONOLULU SPIRITUAL HEALING AND COLONIC IRRIGATION BLOCK-LONG HOT DOGS BUY YOUR DREAM HOME NOW . " Tarzana , " said the chauffeur startlingly ; and there , sure enough , was the name suspended , in white letters , across the road . " There 's Tarzana College , " the man went on , pointing to a group of Spanish-Colonial palaces clustering round a Romanesque basilica . " Mr. Stoyte , he 's just given them an audi-torium . " They turned to the right along a less important road . The orange groves gave place for a few miles to huge fields of alfalfa and dusty grass , then returned again more luxuriant than ever . All at once , through a gap between two or-chards , Jeremy Pordage saw a most surprising sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an island off a cliff-bound coast , a rocky hill rose abruptly , in places almost precipitously , from the plain . On the summit of the bluff and as though growing out of it in a kind of stony efflorescence , stood a castle . But what a castle ! The donjon was like a skyscraper , the bastions plunged headlong with the effortless swoop of concrete dams . The thing was Gothic , medieval , baronial  --  doubly baronial , Gothic with a Gothicity raised , so to speak , to a higher power , more medieval than any building of the thirteenth century . Jeremy was startled into speech . " What on earth is that ? " he asked , pointing at the nightmare on the hilltop . " Why , that 's Mr. Stoyte 's place , " said the retainer ; and smiling yet once more with the pride of vicarious ownership , he added : " It 's a pretty fine home , I guess . " The orange groves closed in again ; leaning back in his seat , Jeremy Pordage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iet himself in for when he accepted Mr. Stoyte 's offer . The pay was princely ; the work , which was to catalogue the almost legendary Hauberk Papers , would be delightful . But that cemetery , this Object  --  Jeremy shook his head . He had known , of course , that Mr. Stoyte was rich , collected pictures , owned a show place in California . But no one had ever led him to expect this . The humorous puritanism of his good taste was shocked ; he was appalled at the prospect of meeting the person capable of committing such an enormity . Between that person and oneself , what contact , what community of thought or feeling could possibly exist ? Why had he sent for one ? For it was obvious that he could n't conceivably like one 's books . But had he even read one 's books ? Did he have the faintest idea of what one was like ? These anxious questionings were interrupted by the noise of the horn , which the chauffeur was sounding with a loudand offensive insistence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford was creeping tremulously along the road . It carried , lashed insecurely to roof and running boards and luggage rack , a squalid cargo of household goods  --  rolls of bedding , an old iron stove , a crate of pots and pans , a folded tent , a tin bath . As they flashed past , Jeremy had a glimpse of three dull-eyed , anaemic children , of a woman with a piece of sacking wrapped round her shoulders , of a haggard , unshaved man . " Transients , " the chauffeur explained in a tone of contempt . " What 's that ? " Jeremy asked . " Why , transients , " the Negro repeated , as though the emphasis were an explanation . " Guess that lot 's from the dust bowl . Kansas license plate . Come to pick our navels . " " Come to pick your navels ? " Jeremy echoed incredulously . " Navel oranges , " said the chauffeur . " It 's the season . Pretty good year for navels , I guess . " They emerged once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , larger than ever . Jeremy had time to study the details of its construction . A wall with towers encircled the base of the hill , and there was a second line of defense , in the most approved post-Crusades manner , half way up . On the summit stood the square keep , surrounded by subsidiary buildings . From the donjon , Jeremy 's eyes traveled down to a group of buildings in the plain , not far from the foot of the hill . Across the facade of the largest of them the words " Stoyte Home for Sick Children " were written in gilded fetters . Two flags , one the Stars and Stripes , the other a white banner with the letter S in scarlet , fluttered in the breeze . Then a grove of leafless walnut trees shut out the view once again . Almost at the same moment the chauffeur threw his engine out of gear and put on the brakes . The car came gently to a halt beside a man who was walking at a brisk pace along the grassy verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the Negro called . The stranger turned his head , gave the man a smile of recognition , and came to the window of the car . He was a large man , broad-shouldered , but rather stooping , with brown hair turning gray and a face , Jeremy thought , like the face of one of those statues which Gothic sculptors carved for a place high up on a west front  --  a face of sudden prominences and deeply shadowed folds and hollows , emphatically rough-hewn so as to be expressive even at a distance . But this particular face , he went on to notice , was not merely emphatic , not only for the distance ; it was a face also for the near point , also for intimacy , a subtle face , in which there were the signs of sensibility and intelligence as well as of power , of a gentle and humorous serenity no less than of energy and strength . " Hullo , George , " the stranger said , addressing the chauffeur ; " nice of you to stop for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , Mr. Propter , " said the Negro cordially . Then he half turned in his seat , waved a hand towards Jeremy and with a florid formality of tone and manner , said , " I 'd like to have you meet Mr. Pordage of England . Mr. Pordage , this is Mr. Propter . " The two men shook hands and , after an exchange of courtesies , Mr. Propter got into the car . " You 're visiting with Mr. Stoyte ? " he asked , as the chauffeur drove on . Jeremy shook his head . He was here on business ; had come to look at some manuscripts  --  the Hauberk Papers , to be precise . Mr. Propter listened attentively , nodded from time to time , and , when Jeremy had finished , sat for a moment in silence . " Take a decayed Christian , " he said at last in a meditative tone , " and the remains of a Stoic ; mix thoroughly with good manners , a bit of money and an old-fashioned education ; simmer for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman . Well , therewere worse types of human being . " He uttered a little laugh . " I might almost claim to have been one myself once , long ago . " Jeremy looked at him inquiringly . " You 're not William Propter , are you ? " he asked . " Not Short Studies in the Counter Reformation , by any chance ? " The other inclined his head . Jeremy looked at him in amazement and delight . Was it possible ? he asked himself . Those Short Studies had been one of his favorite books  --  a model , he had always thought , of their kind . " Well , I 'm jiggered , " he said aloud , using the schoolboyish locution deliberately and as though between inverted commas . There was another moment of silence . Then , instead of talking , as Jeremy had expected , about the Short Studies , Mr. Propter merely shook his head and said , " We mostly are . " " Mostly are what ? " asked Jeremy . " Jiggered , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word , " he added . The walnut trees came to an end and there once more , on the starboard bow , was the Object . Mr. Propter pointed in its direction . " Poor Jo Stoyte ! " he said . " Think of having that millstone round one 's neck . Not to mention of course all the other millstones that go with it . What luck we 've had , do n't you think ? ? we who 've never been given the opportunity of being anything much worse than scholars and gentlemen ! " After another little silence , " Poor Jo , " he went on with a smile , " he is n't either of them . You 'll find him a bit trying . Because of course he 'll want to bully you , just because tradition says that your type is superior to his type . Not to mention the fact , " he added , looking into Jeremy 's face with an expression of mingled amusement and sympathy , " that you 're probably the sort of person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid , as well as a scholar and gentleman . " Feeling simultaneously annoyed by the man 's indiscretion and touched by AFTER MANY A SUMMER his friendliness , Jeremy smiled rather nervously and nodded his head . " Maybe , " Mr. Propter went on , " maybe it would help you to be less of a murderee toward Jo Stoy Le , if you knew what gave him the original impulsion to get damned in just that way " ? and he pointed again toward the Object . " We were at school together , Jo and I ; only nobody called him Jo in those days . We called him Slob , or Jelly-Belly . Because , you see , poor Jo was the local fat boy , the only fat boy in the school during those years . And , being fat , he was fair game for the rest of us . God , how we punished him for his glandular deficiencies ! And how disastrously he reacted to that punishment ! Over-compensation . . . But here I am at home , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackened speed and came to a halt in front of a small white bungalow set in the midst of a clump of eucalyptus trees . " We 'll go on with this another time . But remember , if poor Jo gets too offensive , think of what he was at school and be sorry for him  --  and do n't be sorry for yourself . " The car roiled on again . At once bewildered and reassured by his encounter with the author of the Short Studies , Jeremy sat , inertly looking out of the window . They were very near the Object now ; and suddenly he noticed , for the first time , that the castle hill was surrounded by a moat . Some few hundred yards from the water 's edge , the car passed between two pillars , topped by heraldic lions . Its passage , it was evident , interrupted a beam of invisible light directed on a photoelectric cell ; for no sooner were they past the lions than a drawbridge began to descend . Five seconds before they reached the moat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a halt in front of the main gateway of the castle 's outer walls . The chauffeur got out and , speaking into a telephone receiver concealed in a convenient loophole , announced his presence . The chromium-plated portcullis rose noiselersly , the double doors ofstainless steel swung back . They drove in . The car began to climb . The second line of walls was pierced by another gate , which opened automatically as they approached . Between the inner side of this second wall and the slope of the hill a Ferro-concrete bridge had been constructed , large enough to accommodate a tennis court . In the shadowy space beneath , Jeremy caught sight of something familiar . An instant later he had recognized it as a replica of the grotto of Lourdes . The car climbed on . Beyond the grotto all the hillside was a cactus garden . Then the road swung round to the northern slope of the bluff , and the cactuses gave place to grass and shrubs . On a little terrace , over-elegant like a fashion-plate from some mythological Vogue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water from her deliciously polished breasts . A little farther on , behind wire netting , a group of baboons squatted among the rocks . Still climbing , the car turned again and finally drew up on a circular concrete platform , carried out on cantilevers over a precipice . Once more the old-fashioned retainer , the chauffeur , taking off his cap , did a final impersonation of himself welcoming the young master home to the plantation , then set to work to unload the luggage . Jeremy Pordage walked to the balustrade and looked over . The ground fell almost sheer for about a hundred feet , then sloped steeply to the inner circle of walls and , below them , to the outer fortifications . Beyond lay the moat and , on the farther side of the moat , stretched the orange orchards . " In domicil ; Laub die Gold-Orangen &Win,"; he murmured to himself . He turned round and , leaning back against the parapet , looked up . The Object impended , insolently enormous . Nobody had dealt poetically with that . Not Childe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the Lady of Shallott , not Sir Leoline . Sir Leoline , he repeated to himself with a connoisseur 's appreciation of romantic absurdity , Sir Leoline , the baron rich , had  --  what ? A toothless mastiff bitch . But Mr. Stoyte had baboons and a sacred grotto , Mr. Stoyte had a chromium portcullis and the Hauberk Papers , Mr. Stoyte had a cemetery like an amusement park and a donjon like . . . There was a sudden rumbling sound ; the great nail-studded doors of the Early English entrance porch rolled back and from between them , as though propelled by a hurricane , a small , thick-set man , with a red face and a mass of snow-white hair , darted out on to the terrace and bore down upon Jeremy . His expression , as he advanced , did not change . The face wore that shut , unsmiling mask which American workmen tend to put on in their dealings with strangers  --  in order to prove , by not making the ingratiating grimaces of courtesy , that theirs is a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Mr. Pordage ? " said the stranger in a harsh , barking voice . " Pleased to meet you . My name 's Stoyte . " As they shook hands , he peered , still unsmiling , into Jeremy 's face . " You 're older than I thought , " he added . For the second time that morning , Jeremy made his mannequin 's gesture of apologetic self-exhibition . " The sere and withered leaf , " he said . " One 's sinking into senility . One 's . . . " Mr. Stoyte cut him short . " What 's your age ? " he asked in a loud peremptory tone , like that of a police sergeant interrogating a captured thief . " Fifty-four . " " Only fifty-four ? " Mr. Stoyte shook his head . " Ought to be full of pep at fifty-four . How 's your sex life ? " he added disconcertingly . Jeremy tried to laugh off his embarrassment . He twinkled ; he patted his bald head . " Mon beau printemps et mon ete ont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's that ? " said Mr. Stoyte frowning . " No use talking foreign Ianguages to me . I never had any education . " He broke into a sudden braying of laughter . " I 'm head of an oil company here , " he said . " Got two thousand filling stations in California alone . And not one man in any of those filling stations that is n't a college graduate ! " He brayed again , triumphantly . " Go and talk foreign languages to them . " He was silent for a moment ; then , pursuing an unexplicit association of ideas , " My agent in London , " he went on , " the man who picks up things for me there  --  he gave me your name . Told me you were the right man for those  --  what do you call them ? You know , those papers I bought this summer . Roebuck ? Ho-buck ? " " Hauberk , " said Jeremy , and with a gloomy satisfaction noted that he had been quite right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of one 's existence . Still , one had to remember that he had been called Jelly-Belly when he was young . " Hauberk , " Mr. Stoyte repeated with a contemptuous impatience . " Anyhow , he said you were the man . " Then , without pause or transition , " What was it you were saying , about your sex life , when you started that foreign stuff on me ? " Jeremy laughed uncomfortably . " One was implying that it was normal for one 's age . " " What do you know about what 's normal at your age ? " said Mr. Stoyte . " Go and talk to Dr. Obispo about it . It wo n't cost you anything . Obispo 's on salary . He 's the house physician . " Abruptly changing the subject , " Would you like to see the castle ? " he asked . " I 'll take you round . " III There was silence in Ward Sixteen of the Stoyte Home for Sick Children ; silence and the luminous twilight of drawn Venetian blinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five small convalescents were asleep . A fourth lay staring at the ceiling , pensively AFTER MANY A SUMMER 569 picking his nose . The fifth , a little girl , was whispering to a doll as curly and Aryan as herself . Seated by one of the windows , a young nurse was absorbed in the latest issue of True Confessions . There was a noise outside in the corridor . The door of the ward flew open , as though before the blast of a hurricane , and someone came rushing into the room . The nurse looked up with a start of surprise . " Why , Mr. Stoyte ! " Disturbed by the noise , the young nose-picker dropped his eyes from the ceiling , the little girl turned away from her doll . " Uncle Jo ! " they shouted simultaneously . " Uncle Jo ! " Starting out of sleep , the others took up the cry . " Uncle Jo ! Uncle Jo ! " Mr. Stoyte was touched by the warmth of his reception . The face which Jeremy had found so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he covered his ears with his hands . " You 'll make me deaf , " he cried . Then , in an aside to the nurse , " Poor kids , " he murmured . " Makes me feel I 'd kind of like to cry . " His voice became husky with sentiment . " And when one thinks how sick they 've been . . . " He shook his head , leaving the sentence unfinished ; then , in another tone , " By the way , " he added , waving a large square hand in the direction of Jeremy Pordage , who had followed him into the ward and was standing near the door , wearing an expression of bewildered embarrassment , " This is Mr. . . Mr. . . . Hell ! I 've forgotten your name . " " Pordage , " said Jeremy , and reminded himself that Mr. Stoyte 's name had once been Slob . " Pordage , that 's it . Ask him about history and literature , " he added derisively to the nurse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his period was only from the invention of Ossian to the death of Keats , when Mr. Stoyte turned back to the children and , in a voice that drowned the other 's faintly fluted disclaimers , shouted : " Guess what Uncle Jo 's brought you ! " They guessed . Candies , bubble gum , balloons , guinea pigs . Mr. Stoyte continued triumphantly to shake his head . Finally , when the children had exhausted their powers of imagination , he dipped into the pocket of his old tweed jacket and produced , first , a whistle , then a mouth organ , then a small musical box , then a trumpet , then a wooden rattle , then an automatic pistol . This , however , he hastily put back . " Now play , " he said , when he had distributed the instruments . " All together . One , two , three . " And , beating time with both arms , he began to sing " Way down upon the Swanee River . " At this latest in a long series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expression of more intense bewilderment . What a morning ! The arrival at dawn . The Negro retainer . The interminable suburb . The Beverly Pantheon . The Object among the orange trees and his meeting with William Propter and this really dreadful Stoyte . Then , inside the castle , the Rubens , and the great El Greco in the hall , the Vermeer in the elevator , the Rembrandt etchings along the corridors , the Winter-halter in the butler 's pantry . Then Miss Maunciple 's Louis XV boudoir , with the Watteau and the two Lancrets and the fully equipped soda fountain in a rococo embrasure , and Miss Maunciple herself , in an orange kimono , drinking a raspberry and peppermint ice cream soda at her own counter . He had been introduced , had refused the offer of a sundae , and been hurried on again , always at top speed . always as though on the wings of a tornado , to see the other sights of the castle . The Rumpus Room , for example , with frescoes of elephants by Sent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no books , because Mr. Stoyte had not yet brought himself to buy any . The small dining room , with its Fra Angelico and its furniture from Brighton Pavilion . The large dining room , modeled on the interior of the mosque at Fatehpur Sikri . The ballroom with its mirrors and coffered ceiling . The thirteenth-century stained glass in the eleventh-floor W.C. The morning room , with Boucher 's picture of La Petite Morphil bottom upward on a pink satin sofa . The chapel , imported in fragments from Goa , with the walnut confessional used by St. Francois de Sales at Annecy . The functional billiard room . The indoor swimming pool . The Second Empire bar , with its nudes by Ingres . The two gymnasiums . The Christian Science Reading Room , dedicated to the memory of the late Mrs. Stoyte . The dentist 's office . The Turkish bath . Then down , with Vermeer , into the bowels of the hill , to look at the cellar in which the Hauberk Papers had been stored . Down again yet deeper to the safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the well and pumping station . Then up once more to ground level and the kitchens , where the Chinese chef had shown Mr. Stoyte the newly arrived consignment of turtles from the Caribbean . Up again to the bedroom which Jeremy was to occupy during his stay . Then up another six storeys to the business office , where Mr. Stoyte gave orders to his secretary , dictated a couple of letters and had a long telephone conversation with his brokers in Amsterdam . And when that was finished it had been time to go to the hospital . Mr. Stoyte 's knobbed face , as he left the hospital , was still illuminated with benevolence and happiness . " Makes you feel kind of good , playing with those poor kids , " he kept repeating to Jeremy . A wide flight of steps led down from the hospital entrance to the roadway . At the foot of these steps Mr. Stoyte 's blue Cadillac was waiting . Behind it stood another smaller car , which had not been there when they arrived . A look of suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Kidnappers , blackmailers  --  one never knew . His hand went to the pocket of his coat . " Who 's there ? " he shouted in a tone of such loud fury that Jeremy thought for a moment that the man must have suddenly gone mad . Moonlike , a large , snub-featured face appeared at the car window , smiling round the chewed butt of a cigar . " Oh , it 's you , Clancy , " said Mr. Stoyte . " Why did n't they tell me you were here ? " he went on . His face had flushed darkly ; he was frowning and a muscle in his cheek had begun to twitch . " I do n't like having strange cars around . Do you hear , Peters ? " he almost screamed at his chauffeur  --  not because it was the man 's business of course ; simply because he happened to be there , available . " Do you hear , I say ? " Then , suddenly , he remembered what Dr. Obispo had said to him that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really want to shorten your life , Mr. Stoyte ? " The doctor 's tone had been one of cool amusement ; he had smiled with an expression of politely sarcastic indulgence . " Are you absolutely bent on having a stroke ? A second stroke , remember ; and you wo n't get off so lightly next time . Well , if so , then go on behaving as you 're doing now . Go on . " With an enormous effort of will , Mr. Stoyte swallowed his anger . " God is love , " he said to himself . " There is no death . " The Late Prudence McGladdery Stoyte had been a Christian Scientist . " God is love , " he said again , and reflected that , if people would only stop being so exasperating , he would never have to lose his temper . " God is love . " It was all their fault . Clancy , meanwhile , had left his car and , grotesquely pot-bellied over spindly legs , was coming up the steps , mysteriously smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Stoyte inquired and wished to God the man would n't make those faces . " Oh , by the way , " he added , " this is Mr. . . . Mr. . . . " " Pordage , " said Jeremy . Clancy was pleased to meet him . The hand he gave to Jeremy was disagreeably sweaty . " I got some news for you , " said Clancy in a hoarse conspiratorial whisper ; and , speaking behind his hand , so that his words and the smell of cigar should be for Mr. Stoyte alone , " You remember Tittelbaum ? " he added . " That chap in the City Engineer 's Department ? " Clancy nodded . " One of the boys , " he affirmed enigmatically , and again winked . " Well , what about him ? " asked Mr. Stoyte ; and in spite of God 's being love , there was a note in his voice of renascent exasperation . Clancy shot a glance at Jeremy Pordage ; then , with the elaborate byplay of Guy Fawkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took Mr. Stoyte by the arm and led him a few feet away , up the steps . " Do you know what Tittelbaum told me today ? " he asked rhetorically . " He told me what they 've decided about . . . " he lowered his voice still further , " about the San Felipe Valley . " " Well , what have they decided ? " Once more Mr. Stoyte was at the limits of his patience . " They 've decided , " Clancy said very slowly , so as to give each word its full dramatic effect , " they 've decided to pipe the water into it . " Mr. Stoyte 's expression of exasperation gave place at last to one of interest . " Enough to irrigate the whole valley ? " he asked . " Enough to irrigate the whole valley , " Clancy repeated with solemnity . Mr. Stoyte was silent for a moment . " How much time have we got ? " he asked at last . " Tittelbaum thought the news would n't break for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoyte hesitated for a moment ; then made his decision . " All right . Get busy at once , " he said with the peremptory manners of one ac-customed to command . " Go down yourself and take a few of the other boys along with you . Independent purchasers  --  interested in cattle raising ; want to start a Dude Ranch . Buy all you can . What 's the price , by the way ? " " Averages twelve dollars art acre . " " Twelve , " Mr. Stoyte repeated , and reflected that it would go to a hundred as soon as they started laying the pipe . " How many acres do you figure you can get ? " he asked . " Maybe thirty thousand . " Mr. Stoyte 's face beamed with satisfaction . " Good , " he said briskly . " Very good . No mention of my name of course , " he added , and then , without pause or transition : " What 's Tittelbaum going to cost ? " Clancy smiled contemptuously . " Oh , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That all ? " The other nodded . " Tittelbaum 's in the bargain basement , " he said . " Ca n't afford to ask any fancy prices . He needs the money  --  needs it awful bad . " " What for ? " asked Mr. Stoyte , who had a professional interest in human nature . " Gambling ? Women ? " Clancy shook his head . " Doctors , " he explained . " He 's got a kid that 's paralyzed . " " Paralyzed ? " Mr. Stoyte echoed in a tone of genuine sympathy . " That 's too bad . " He hesitated for a moment ; then , in a sudden burst of generosity , " Tell him to send the kid here , " he went an , making a large gesture toward the hospital . " Best place in the State for infantile paralysis , and it wo n't cost him anything . Not a red cent . " " Hell , that 's kind of you , Mr. Stoyte , " said Clancy admiringly . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , " said Mr. Stoyte , as he moved toward his car . " I 'm glad to be able to do it . Remember what it says in the Bible about children . You know , " he added , " I get a real kick out of being with those poor kids in there . Makes you feel kind of warm inside . " He patted the barrel of his chest . " Tell Tittelbaum to send in an application for the kid . Send it to me personally . I 'll see that it goes through at once . " He climbed into the car and shut the door after him ; then , catching sight of Jeremy , opened it again without a word . Mumbling apologetically , Jeremy scrambled in . Mr. Stoyte slammed the door once more , lowered the glass , and looked out . " So long , " he said . " And do n't lose any time about that San Felipe business . Make a good job of it , Clancy , and I 'll let you have ten per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raised the window and signaled to the chauffeur to start . The car swung out of the drive and headed toward the castle . Leaning back in his seat , Mr. Stoyte thought of those poor kids and the money he would make out of the San Felipe business . " God is love , " he said yet once more , with momentary conviction and again in a whisper that was audible to his companion , " God is love . " Jeremy felt more uncomfortable than ever . The drawbridge came down as the blue Cadillac approached , the chromium portcullis went up , the gates of the inner rampart rolled back to let it pass . On the concrete tennis court the seven children of the Chinese cook were roller-skating . Below , in the sacred grotto , a group of masons were at work . At the sight of them Mr. Stoyte shouted to the chauffeur to stop . " They 're putting up a tomb for some nuns , " he said to Jeremy as they got out of the car . " Some nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explained that his Spanish agents had bought some sculpture and iron work from the chapel of a convent that had been wrecked by the anarchists at the beginning of the civil war . " They sent some nuns along too , " he added . " Embalmed , I guess . Or maybe just sun-dried . I do n't know . Anyhow , there they are . Luckily I happened to have something nice to put MAGAZINE them in . " He pointed to the monument which the masons were in process of fixing to the south wall of the grotto . On a marble shelf above a large Roman sarcophagus were the statues by some nameless Jacobean stonemason of a gentleman and lady , both in ruffs , kneeling , and behind them in three rows of three , nine daughters diminishing from adolescence to infancy . " Hie jacet Carolus Franciscus Beats , Armiger . . . " Jeremy began to read . " Bought it in England two years ago , " said Mr. Stoyte , interrupting him . Then , turning to the workmen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To-morrow noon . Maybe to-night . " " That 's all I wanted to know , " said Mr. Stoyte , and turned away . " I must have those nuns taken out of storage , " he said , as they walked back to the car . They drove on . Poised on the almost invisible vibration of its wings , a humming bird was drinking at the jet that spouted from the left nipple of Giambologna 's nymph . From the enclosure of the baboons came the shrill noise of battle and copulation . Mr. Stoyte shut his eyes . " God is love , " he repeated , trying deliberately to prolong the delightful condition of euphoria into which those poor kids and Clancy 's good news had plunged him . " God is love . There is no death . " He waited to feel that sense of inward warmth , like the aftereffect of whisky , which had followed his previous utterance of the words . Instead , as though some immanent fiend were playing a practical joke on him , he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own corpse , and of judgment and the flames . Prudence McGladdcry Stoyte had been a Christian Scientist ; but Joseph Budge Stoyte , his father , had been a Sandemanian ; and Letitia Morgan , his maternal grandmother , had lived and died a Plymouth Sister . Over his cot in the attic room of the little frame house in Nashville , Tennessee , had hung the text , in vivid orange on a black background : " IT IS A TERRIBLE THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD . " " God is love , " Mr. Stoyte desperately reaffirmed . " There is no death . " But for sinners , such as himself , it was only the worm that never died . " If you 're always scared of dying , " Obispo had said , " you 'll surely die . Fear 's a poison ; and not such a slow poison either . " Making another enormous effort , Mr. Stoyte suddenly began to whistle . The tune was " I 'm making hay in the moonlight in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pordage saw and , as though from some horrible and indecent secret , immediately averted his eyes from , was the face of a man in the condemned cell . " Old sour-puss , " the chauffeur muttered to himself , as he watched his employer get out of the car and walk away . Followed by Jeremy , Mr. Stoyte hurried in silence through the Gothic portal , crossed a pillared Romanesque lobby like the Lady Chapel at Durham and , his hat still pulled down over his eyes , stepped into the cathedral twilight of the great hall . A hundred feet overhead , the sound of the two men 's footsteps echoed in the vaulting . Like iron ghosts , the suits of armor stood immobile round the walls . Above them , sumptuously dim , the fifteenth-century tapestries opened windows upon a leafy world of phantasy . At one end of the cavernous room , lit by a hidden searchlight , El Greco 's Crucifixion of St. Peter blazed out in the darkness like the beautiful revelation of something incomprehensible and profoundly sinister . At the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Flel &ie; Fourment , dressed only in a bearskin cape . Jeremy looked from one to the other  --  from the ectoplasm of the inverted saint to the unequivocal skin and fat and muscle which Rubens had so loved to see and touch ; from unearthly flesh tints of green-white ochre and carmine , shadowed with transparent black , to the creams and warm pinks , the nacreous blues and greens of Flemishnudity . Two shining symbols , incomparably powerful and expressive  --  but of what , of what ? That , of course , was the question . Mr. Stoyte paid attention to none of his treasures , but strode across the hall , inwardly cursing his buried wife for having made him think about death by insisting that there was n't any . The door of the elevator was in an embrasure between pillars . Mr. Stoyte opened it , and the light came on revealing a Dutch lady in blue satin sitting at a harpsichord  --  sitting , Jeremy reflected , at the very heart of an equation , in a world where beauty and logic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut the door , " Mr. Stoyte ordered ; then when it was done , " We 'll have a swim before lunch , " he added , and pressed the topmost of a long row of buttons . IV More than a dozen families of transients were already at work in the orange grove , as the man from Kansas , with his wife and his three children and his yellow dog , hurried down the line toward the trees which the overseer had assigned to him . They walked in silence , for they had nothing to say to one another and no energy to waste on words . Only half a day , the man was thinking ; only four hours till work would be stopped . They 'd be lucky if they made as much as seventy-five cents . Seventy-five cents . Seventy-five cents ; and that right front tire was n't going to last much longer . If they meant to get up to Fresno and then Salinas they 'd just have to get a better one . But even the rottenest old second-hand tire cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat ! he thought with sudden resentment . If he were alone , if he did n't have to drag the kids and Minnie around , then he could rent a little place somewhere . Near the highway , so that he could make a bit extra by selling eggs and fruit and things to the people that rode past in their automobiles , sell a lot cheaper than the markets and still make good money . And then , maybe , he 'd be able to buy a cow and a couple of hogs ; and then he 'd find a girl  --  one of those fat ones ; he liked them rather fat ; fat and young , with . . . His wife started coughing again ; the dream was shattered . Did they eat ! More than they were worth . Three kids with no strength in them . And Minnie going sick on you half the time so that you had to do her work as well as yours ! The dog had paused to sniff at a post . With sudden and surprising agility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked the animal squarely in the ribs . " You goddam dog ! " he shouted . " Get out of the way ! " It ran off , yelping . The man from Kansas turned his head in the hope of catching in his children 's faces an expression of disapproval or commiseration . But the children had learned better than to give him an excuse for going on from the dog to themselves . Under the tousled hair , the three pale , small faces were entirely blank and vacant Disappointed , the man turned away grumbling indistinctly that he 'd belt the hell out of them if they were n't careful . The mother did not even turn her head . She was feeling too sick and tired to do anything but walk straight on . Silence settled down again over the party . Then , suddenly , the youngest of the three children let out a shrill cry . " Look there ! " she pointed . In front of them was the castle . From the summit of its highest tower rose a spidery metal structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty or thirty feet above the parapet . On the highest of these platforms , black against the shining sky , stood a tiny human figure . As they looked , the figure spread its arms and plunged head foremost out of sight behind the battlements . The children 's shrill outcry of astonishment gave the man from Kansas the pretext which , a moment before , they had denied him . He turned on them furiously . " Stopthat yellin ' , " he yelled ; then rushed at them , hitting out  --  a slap on the side of the head for each of them . With an enormous effort , the woman lifted herself from the abyss of fatigue into which she had fallen ; she halted , she turned , she cried out protestingly , she caught her husband 's arm . He pushed her away , so violently that she almost fell . " You 're as bad as the kids , " he shouted at her . " Just layin ' around and eatin ' . Not worth a damn . I tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . Sick and tired , " he repeated . " So you keep your mouth shut , see ! " He turned away and , feeling a good deal better for his outburst , walked briskly on , at a rate which he knew his wife would find exhausting , between the rows of loaded orange trees . From that swimming pool at the top of the donjon the view was prodigious . Floating on the translucent water , one had only to turn one 's head to see , between the battlements , successive vistas of plain and mountain , of green and tawny and violet and faint blue . One floated , one looked and one thought , that is , if one were Jeremy Pordage , of that tower in Epipsychidion , that tower with its chambers Looking toward the golden Eastern air And level with the living winds . Not so , however , if one were Miss Virginia Maunciple . Virginia neither floated , nor looked , nor thought of Epipsychidion , but took another sip of whisky and soda , climbed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plunged , glided under water and , coming up immediately beneath the unsuspecting Pordage , caught him by the belt of his bathing pants and pulled him under . " You asked for it , " she said , as he came up again , gasping and spluttering , to the surface . " Lying there without moving , like a silly old Buddha . " She smiled at him with an entirely good-natured contempt . These people that Uncle Jo kept bringing to the castle ! An Englishman with AFTER MANY A SUMMER a monocle to look at the armor ; a man with a stammer to clean the pictures ; a man who could n't speak anything but German to look at some silly old pots and plates ; and to-day this other ridiculous Englishman with a face like a rabbit 's and a voice like " Songs without Words " on the saxophone . Jeremy Pordage blinked the water out of his eyes and , dimly , since he was presbyopic and without his spectacles , saw the young laughing face very close to his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not often that he found himself in such proximity to such a being . Ile swallowed his annoyance and smiled at her . Miss Maunciple stretched out a hand and patted the bald patch at the top of Jeremy 's head . " Boy , " she said , " does it shine ! Talk of billiard balls . I know what I shall call you : Ivory . Good-by , Ivory . " She turned , swam to the ladder , climbed out , walked to the table on which the bottles and glasses were standing , drank the rest of her whisky and soda , then went and sat down on the edge of the couch on which , in black spectacles and bathing drawers , Mr. Stoyte was taking his sun bath . " Well , Uncle Jo , " she said in a tone of affectionate playfulness , " feeling kind of good ? " " Feeling fine , baby , " he answered . It was true ; the sun had melted away his dismal forebodings ; he was living again in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick children ; in which there were Tittelbaums prepared , for five hundred bucks , to give one information worth at the very least a million ; in which the sky was blue and the sunshine a caressing warmth upon the stomach ; in which finally , one stirred out of a delicious somnolence to see little Virginia smiling down at one as though she really cared for her old Uncle Jo , and cared for him , what was more , not merely as an old uncle  --  no , sir ; because when all 's said and done , a man is only as old as he feels and acts ; and wherehis baby was concerned did he feel young ? did he act young ? Yes , sir . Mr. Stoyte smiled to himself , a smile of triumphant self-satisfaction . " Well , baby , " he said aloud , and laid a square , thick-fingered hand on the young woman 's bare knee . Through half-closed eyelids , Miss Maunciple gave him a secret and somehow indecent look of understanding and complicity ; then uttered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun feel good ! " she said ; and , closing her lids completely , she lowered her raised arms , clasped her hands behind her neck and threw back her shoulders . It was a pose that lifted the breasts , that emphasized the inward curve of the loins and the contrary swell of the buttocks  --  the sort of pose that a new arrival in the seraglio would be taught by the eunuchs to assume at her first interview with the sultan . Through his dark glasses , Mr. Stoyte looked up at her with an expression of possessiveness at once gluttonous and paternal . Virginia was his baby , not only figuratively and colloquially , but also in the literal sense of the word . His sentiments were simultaneously those of the purest father-love and the most violent eroticism . He looked up at her . By contrast with the shiny white satin of her breech clout and brassiere , the sunburnt skin seemed more richly brown . The planes of the young body flowed in smooth continuous curves , effortlessly solid , three-dimensional without accent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auburn hair and came down by way of the rounded forehead , of the wide-set eyes , and small , straight , impudent nose to the mouth . That mouth  --  it was her most striking feature . For it was to the mouth 's short upper lip that Virginia 's face owed its characteristic expression of childlike innocence  --  an expression that persisted through all her moods , that was noticeable whatever she might be doing , whether it was telling smutty stories or making conversation with the Bishop , taking tea in Pasadena or getting tight with the boys , enjoying what she called " a bit of yum-yum , " or attending Mass . Chronologically , Miss Maunciple was a young woman of twenty-two ; but that abbreviated upper lip gave her , in all circumstances , an air of being hardly adolescent , of not having reached the age of consent . For Mr. Stoyte , at sixty , the curiously perverse contrast between childishness and maturity , between the appearance of innocence and the fact of experience , was intoxicatingly attractive . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both kinds of baby ; she was also both kinds of baby objectively , in herself . Delicious creature ! The hand that had lain inert , hitherto , upon her knee slowly contracted . Between the broad spatulate thumb and the strong fingers , what smoothness , what a sumptuous and substantial resilience ! " What are you pinching me for , Uncle Jo ? " " I 'd like to eat you , " her Uncle Jo replied in a tone of cannibalistic sentimentality . " I 'm tough . " Mr. Stoyte uttered a maudlin chuckle . " Little tough kid ! " he said . The tough kid stooped down and kissed him . Jeremy Pordage , who had been quietly looking at the panorama and continuing his silent recitation of Eppsychidion , happened at this moment to turn once more in the direction of the couch and was so much embarrassed by what he saw that he began to sink and had to strike out violently with arms and legs to prevent himself from going under . Turning round in the water , he swam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry himself , hurried to the elevator . " Really , " he said to himself as he looked at the Vermeer . " Really ! " " I did some business this morning , " said Mr. Stoyte when the baby had straightened herself up again . " What sort of business ? " MAGAZINE " Good business , " he answered . " Might make a lot of money . Real money , " he insisted . " How much ? " " Maybe half a million , " he said , cautiously understating his hopes ; " maybe a million ; maybe even more . " " Uncle Jo , " she said , " I think you 're wonderful . " Her voice had the ring of complete sincerity . She genuinely did think him wonderful . in the world in which she had lived it was axiomatic that a man who could make a million dollars must be wonderful . Parents , friends , teachers , newspapers , radio , advertisements  --  explicitly or by implication , all were unanimous in proclaiming his wonderfulness . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had given her a wonderful time , and she was grateful . Besides , she liked to like people if she possibly could ; she liked to please them . Pleasing them made her feel good  --  even when they were elderly , like Uncle Jo , and when some of the ways in which she was called upon to please them did n't happen to be very appetizing . " I think you 're wonderful , " she repeated . Her admiration gave him an intense satisfaction . " Oh , it 's quite easy , " he said with hypocritical modesty , angling for more . Virginia gave it him . " Easy , nothing ! " she said firmly . " I say you are wonderful . So just keep your mouth shut . " Enchanted , Mr. Stoyte took another handful of firm flesh and squeezed it affectionately . " I 'll give you a present , if the deal goes through , " he said . " What would you like , baby ? " " What would I like ? " she repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her disinterestedness was not assumed . For it was true ; she never did want things this way , in cold blood . At the moment a want occurred , for an ice cream soda , for example , for a bit of yum-yum , for a mink coat seen in a shop window at such moments , she did want things , and wanted them badly , could n't wait to have them . But as for long-range wants , wants that had to be thought about in advance  --  no , she never had wanted like that . The best part of Virginia 's life was spent in enjoying the successive instants of present contentment of which it was composed ; and if ever circumstances forced her out of this mindless eternity into the world of time , it was a narrow little universe in which she found herself , a world whose farthest boundaries were never more than a week or two away in the future . Even as a show-girl , at eighteen dollars a week , she had found it difficult to bother much about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident and could n't show your legs any more . Then Uncle Jo had come along , and everything was there , as though it grew on trees  --  a swimming-pool tree , a cocktail tree , a Schiaparelli tree . You just had to reach out your hand and there it was , like an apple in the orchard , back home in Oregon . So where did presents come in ? Why should she want anything ? Besides , it was obvious that Uncle Jo got a tremendous kick out of her not wanting things ; and to be able to give Uncle Jo a kick always made her feel good . " I tell you , Uncle Jo , I do n't want any-thing . " " Do n't you ? " said a strange voice , startlingly close behind them . " Well , I do . " Dark-haired and dapper , glossily Levantine , Dr. Sigmund Obispo stepped briskly up to the side of the couch . " To be precise , " he went on , " I want to inject one-point-five cubic centimeters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off you go , my angel , " he said to Virginia in a tone of derision , but with a smile of unabashed desire . " Hop ! " He gave her a familiar little pat on the shoulder and another , when she got up to make room for him , on the white-satin posterior . Virginia turned round sharply , with the intention of telling him not to be so fresh ; then , as her glance traveled from that barrel of hairy flesh which was Mr. Stoyte to the other 's handsome face , soinsultingly sarcastic and at the same time so flatteringly concupiscent , she changed her mind and , instead of telling him , loudly , just where he got off , she made a grimace and stuck out her tongue at him . What was begun as a rebuke had ended , before she knew it , as the acquiescence in an impertinence , as an act of complicity with the offender and of disloyalty to Uncle Jo . Poor Uncle Jo ! she thought , with a rush of affectionate pity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself . The trouble of course was that Dr. Obispo was so handsome ; that he made her laugh ; that she liked his admiration ; that it was fun to lead him on and see how he 'd act . She even enjoyed getting mad at him when he was rude , which he constantly was . " I suppose you think you 're Douglas Fairbanks , Junior , " she said , making an attempt to be scathing ; then walked away with as much dignity as her two little strips of white satin would permit her to assume and , leaning against a battlement , looked down at the plain below . Antlike figures moved among the orange trees . Shc wondered idly what they were doing ; then her mind wandered to other , more interesting and personal matters . To Sig and the fact that she could n't help feeling rather thrilled when he was around , even when he acted the way he had done just now . Some day , maybe  --  some day , just to see what it was like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle . . . Poor Uncle Jo ! she reflected . But then what could he expect  --  at his age and at hers ? The unexpected thing was that , in all these months , she had n't yet given him any reason for being jealous . " Well , and how 's the patient ? " Dr. Obispo inquired in the parody of a bedside manner , as he took Virginia 's place on the couch . He was in the highest of spirits . His work in the laboratory was coming along unexpectedly well ; that new preparation of bile salts had done wonders for his liver ; the rearmament boom had sent his aircraft shares up another three points ; and it was obvious that Virginia was n't going to hold out much longer . " How 's the little invalid this morning ? " he went on , enriching his parody with the caricature of an English accent , for he had done a year of postgraduate work at Oxford . Mr. Stoyte growled inarticulately . There was something about Dr. Obispo 's facetiousness that always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the quality of a deliberate insult . Mr. Stoyte was always made to feel that Obispo 's apparently good-natured banter was in reality the expression of a calculated and malignant contempt . The thought of it made Mr. Stoyte 's blood boil . But when his blood boiled , his blood pressure , he knew , went up , his life was shortened . He could not afford to be as angry with Obispo as he would have liked . And what was more , he could n't afford to get rid of the man . Obispo was an indispensable evil . " God is love ; there is no death . " But Mr. Stoyte remembered with terror that he had had a stroke , that he was growing old . Obispo had put him on his feet again when he was almost dying , had promised him ten more years of life even if those researches did n't work out as well as he hoped ; and if they did work out  --  then more , much more . Twenty years , thirty , forty . Or it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of proving that Mrs. Eddy was right , after all . Perhaps there really and truly would n't be any death  --  not for Uncle Jo , at any rate . Glorious prospect ! Meanwhile . . . Mr. Stoyte sighed , resignedly , profoundly . " We all have our cross to bear , " he said to himself , echoing , across the intervening years , the words his grandmother used when she made him take castor oil . Dr. Obispo , meanwhile , had sterilized his needle , filed the top off a glass ampoule , filled his syringe . " Ready , " he called at last . Obediently and in silence , like a trained elephant , Mr. Stoyte rolled over on to his stomach . ( To be continued )
