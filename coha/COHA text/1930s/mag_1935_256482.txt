For six months , newspaper darkrooms in Chicago and Detroit have closeted mysterious goings-on . Last March the result of this secret business first showed in the pages of the Chicago Tribune . Last month it appeared in Hearst 's Detroit Times . Last week it landed in the Detroit Free Press . The secret : sharp " stop-action " strip pictures of fast-moving objects . Each newspaper was working with its own camera invention , was still secretive about details . But enough facts had leaked out to indicate that a new action-picture vogue was about to spread through the U. S. Press . <P> Chicago Tribune first jolted its readers with remarkably clear continuity pictures of Golden Gloves boxers in action , followed with a strip of Pitcher Dizzy Dean from windup to finish . Cameraddicts knew that no ordinary motion picture film could produce such distinct " stills . " The Tribune 's camera was invented by one Lewis H. Moomaw of suburban Wilmette , a onetime small producer of Hollywood cinemas , lately in the engineering department of Stewart-Warner Corp . All he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will take a series of quick flashes faster than a cinema camera . <P> Detroit Times 's camera chief is a squat , red-thatched pugnacious Hearstling named Jimmy Northmore . For 20 of his 42 years he has worked for Hearst , boasts that the opposition has never beaten him . Twelve years ago , he says , he had the idea for a fast working camera but did nothing about it until he saw the Tribune 's strips . Then he buttonholed the Times 's Editor-in-Chief Albert E. Dale , offered to produce a camera that would match the Tribune 's pictures for some $900 . He closeted himself in his laboratory for three weeks , worked 20 hours a day , emerged with a box 6 in. by 6 in. by 8 in. locked and sealed , and a bill for $800 . The lens , which he keeps shielded from snoopers , cost $350 . <P> Jimmy Northmore called his apparatus " The Magic Eye . " First shots published by the Times were of Baseballer Jimmy Foxx striking out . Northmore snapped a series of Golfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints plainly showing the clubhead traveling ahead of the ball after the impact . Last fortnight at University of Detroit Stadium his " Magic Eye " followed Pole-Vaulter Walter Simmons over the bar ( see cut ) . Last week the Times played up his shots of Socialite Mary Mitchell playing tennis , lions brawling in the Detroit Zoo . <P> Not even other Times cameramen know what is inside Jimmy Northmore 's " Magic Eye ' which he hopes his superiors will patent and manufacture for exclusive Hearstpaper use . He shops for his film at a different drug store every day , admits he uses 12-exposure Kodak film , so spliced as to make 48 exposures . <P> Detroit Free Press made its fast-camera debut last week , also with strips of runners and jumpers at last fortnight 's Western Conference Track Meet at Ann Arbor , Mich . A wry caption explained : " These remarkable pictures . . . were taken with the slow motion picture camera ( magic eye , my aunt ) of the Detroit Free Press . " Cameraman Joseph Kalec , slim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no secret of the fact that he used an ordinary De Vry 35 mm. cinema camera . But he had been obliged to tinker the shutter speed to get " stills " that could be enlarged without blurring.
