I HAPPEN to live part of the year a neighbor to one of the greatest winter golf resorts of the country . Within five miles of me are eight eighteen-hole golf courses , not to mention two packs of hounds , five polo fields , innumerable tennis courts , plenty of swimming , several roque courts , and a factory where bows and arrows are made and the factory hands talk the language of Robin Hood . However , none of this need interest us very much except the golf , for golf , for some reason , has become the game , par excellence , of the average business man ; the retired business man , the retiring business man , and the business man who has n't yet got around to retiring . Just why this should be so remains , as I have said , somewhat of a mystery , for not only is golf one of the most expensive games played but it is probably the most difficult , requiring perfect coordination of mind and muscle . I am able to test this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use my eyes a great deal in the morning , and I know that this affects my golf ? when I occasionally play it ? in the afternoon . If by any chance I am able to play in the morning , my game is n't half bad . Furthermore , golf is the most fatiguing game there is , mentally and physically , unless you play it well . A man can ride , even fox hunt , until he dies in his eighties and nineties , nor need he meanwhile take very much care of himself , as everyone knows who knows riding men . A man can practice archery , swim , or play roque until he has to be wheeled about in a chair . But the average business man does n't want to do any of these things , easy as they are to do and . frequent as are the opportunities nowadays for doing them . He wants to concentrate furiously and terribly on golf . It seems to me that there is more here than merely a desire for exercise or an excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sop thrown to a bad conscience . Golf as played by the average business man is certainly not a recreation . Anyone who has seen weary , and sometimes obese , business men arrive on a train and immediately try to kill themselves by two thirty-six hole games a day will not long cherish the idea that this is pleasure . For the average business man , retired or not , golf is a substitution , not a recreation . It is a substitution for business and ? as now played for the most part ? is more like business than any other game . It was first made popular by a conscience-ridden race , the Scotch ? the more placid Dutch , having invented it , promptly abandoned it ; and as soon at they were given the chance , the conscienceridden English and Americans took it up enthusiastically . You see , golf is the only game extant which combines exercise and at the same time assuages the sense of sin . Not only is the competitive feature of it underscored and doubled , for you are also always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the usual game to placate even an old-line Presbyterian . Moreover , your sins find you out . They are there , unconcealed , for everyone to look at . And there 's no wiping them off . You can not erase a bad shot by a good shot as you can in polo or tennis . Golf is a grand game for those races not yet able to consider painless pleasure as anything but sinful . It is morose , sullen , and gives the impression of being worth while ? the last a very important consideration to the average man trained to business standards . Now , do not mistake me . This is not an attack upon the fundamental idea of business or the individual business man . There is no vision of the Nobel Prize at the back of my head . I regard business as a perfectly natural phase in man 's gradual conquest of his environment , and I believe that until man has completely subjected material to his will he will never have  | much time for his mental and spiritual development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evolution , I believe that even the stupidest business man , intrinsically and in his philosophy , is more advanced than the cleverest and most enlightened duke or robber baron . Furthermore , I have never been able to discover the horrid vacuum in the mind and soul of the business man that some of my fellow writers have been able to discover . Outside of moments of pomposity concerning his calling , and this is by no means confined solely to the business man , I find the upper-stratum business man an almost universally intelligent and pleasant fellow ; alert , interested , and extraordinarily generous minded . Far more generous minded than the average artist , and far more interested in other people and in general questions . But even if I did not sincerely believe these things , I should be a great fool if I were not vitally interested in the business mind and what is going to happen to business , since today business rules the entire world . Even those artists , and naturally there are many of them , who have a contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them each step in their contempt , including the profits , except the initial idea . As for the great business men , naturally few in number , they are of the stuff ' of which all greatness is made , and there is no difference between them and any other great man , whether he be an artist , a professional man , or a statesman . No , I am not puzzled , nor have I any quarrel , with business itself or with the individual business man . I am only puzzled at the attitude of so many intelligent business men toward business . There must be something the matter with business to account for that attitude . Well , there is . The diagnosis seems simple , although the cure is something else . To BEGIN with , no other proof is needed that there is something the matter with business than the fact that so many men retire from it , and so many others want to retire from it . The term " retired business man " is an accusation in itself . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real " calling . " There is no such generic term as retired artist , retired statesman , retired lawyer , retired newspaperman , retired engineer , or retired doctor . There are sporadic instances of retirement in all these walks of life , but as a rule they are the results of illness or old age and represent physical conditions , not a state of mind . For the most part , you could n't retire a painter , writer , surgeon , inventor , editor , and so on if you tried , much as retirement in many instances might seem advisable . These people die in their tracks , still caught up and bemused magnificently by their jobs . Even those poor bewildered creatures , the politicians , when they are retired forcibly spend the rest of their lives trying to get back where they are not wanted . Only the business men retire voluntarily , and not the great business men at that . One does not hear of the Morgans , the Krupps , the Rothschilds , or ? one is forced to include them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fords of the world , retiring . Why is this ? The answer is that these men are caught up by something greater than business . But I do not mean that exactly ? I mean , something greater than business as now understood , for I see no reason why business , properly understood , and as some day it may be understood , should not be as glamorous and enthralling , as worshipful , as any other immense preoccupation a man may have . Nor do those business men who have a deep local , a provincial preoccupation , wish to retire . Those manufacturers , for instance , who are still conducting their mills in an intimate paternalistic fashion , who are the feudal lords of their small towns and are vitally interested in improving them , and who are interested in their workers , and in their plants . Anachronistic as these conditions may be , they hold the interest . Unfortunately business , the latest child of that heavily spawning mother , social conditions , was born with an inferiority complex . In those happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means during most of history , it was considered bad form and a sign of weakness to bargain for anything or attempt a peaceable settlement . You hit your competitor over the head and walked off with whatever of his you wanted ? wife , lands , or cattle . As a result , what business men there were were too humiliated by their state to attempt to achieve any kind of philosophy or body of traditions . The proud guilds of the Middle Ages were  | mostly artisan guilds , and artisans have always had a philosophy of a kind , traditions , and social coherence . They have to-day . The terms that artisans use go back through the centuries . There is always a pride and a higher morality connected with handwork . When these guilds were business guilds , the business men belonging to them salvaged their sense of inferiority by being at the same time explorers , conquerors , and rulers . Percentage was back of the Doges of Venice , of the Hanseatic League , of the buccaneers of Elizabeth , but they disguised this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism and government . By the time business men were powerful enough to admit frankly that they were business men and nothing else , it was no longer the fashion to choose gonfalons and dedicate yourself to king , state , or the Holy Sepulcher . But one of the most curious characteristics of man is that he can not live unless he dedicate himself to something . He must worship something bigger than himself . In short , and it can not be said better , he must lose his soul in order to gain it . Why this is so can not be explained , any more than the fact that a dog , apparently irrationally , requires the same sublimation . But it is true . A man can not be happy unless caught up in a vision beyond the circumference of his own ego . That is why people in love are happy ? for the time being they have lost themselves . Man is born to a quandary , and to-day that quandary has been sharpened . In order to live with any degree of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of worth , and through these the feeling that the human race , terrible as it often seems , is none the less either at present or in its potentialities a dignified and worth-while experiment . Even the most convinced iconoclasts do not actually believe that they are no more than salt and water badly mixed . But , as has just been said , although man must have this individual sense of worth and dignity it can only be achieved , paradoxically enough , by forgetting that sense of worth and dignity in the larger dignity of some general and philosophical ideal . Man is created a dualist . He can not have any sense of dignity merely by himself . That is why contemplation , although so much praised ? at least , in the past ? has never been practiced by any intelligent man ; nor , for that matter , leisure ? also in the past much praised . The intelligent contemplationists have for the most part written books , often in honor of contemplation ; but writing books is not contemplation . And nowadays contemplation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas Moore 's recipe for Oriental otium cum dignitate , " A Persian 's heaven is easily made , ' T is but ? black eyes and lemonade , " if practiced by the usual occidental retired business man is all too likely , as we all know , to degenerate into gin and a succession of eyes ? black , brown , and blue ? which , due to repetition , cease to have even a physical stimulation . And the occidental retired business man is. right : leisure is a desperate condition unless you have some job to do in it bigger than the job you have left . I think it a compliment to the brains of the American business man that he can not retire to uncharted leisure gracefully ; that he can not , for instance , retire to the growing of a garden , that famous former retreat of the retired of any description , except he turn it into a commercial enterprise . And I think it is a sign that the European business man is catching up to his American brother spiritually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . In this short life no man should be satisfied , no matter what his age , so long as his health is good , by the growing of roses merely for his own satisfaction . Roses , save commercially , are an avocation not a vocation ; a background ? and a very necessary one ? but not the present or the future . This SEEMS to be a very materialistic point of view ? Not in the least ; it is a spiritual one . Until recently it was perhaps possible to grow roses , or do anything else , with the conviction that what you did was of little importance since this life was but a brief prelude to a more important one . To-day no good mind can agree to this , no matter how much of a devout believer the possessor of that mind may be , or what , publicly , he may say . There has come a great change in the world . No matter what men may hope for , it has become their conviction , or the conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immense importance , the only thing we know anything about , no matter what else we may desire . For  | the first time in history , mankind has now cor centrated itself ? however badly to begin wit ? on life and not on death . A man , retired c otherwise , simply has n't time to grow rose and do nothing else , unless he is spirituall tired . This is an immense spiritual and ment : revolution not yet generally realized . Now days he may realize his sense of worth in thi life . He can not wait for heaven . Of all the arts , professions , and trades , busi ness is the only one which has no genera philosophy , traditions , or objective . In tha respect it is again like golf ; you fight yourse and the world in a vicious circle , and when you get through you wonder why you did it . This i recognized , although not clearly enough o widely enough , by the greatest business con cerns and they have set up , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public Such an organization as the American Tele phone and Telegraph Company , for instance is not in the least solely preoccupied with divi dends . But business , in order to save itself , anc to save the soul of the man engaged in it , mus eventually extend itself far beyond these limits Even the poorest artist starts with a vision and feels himself the direct descendant of fine and , on the whole , unselfish tradition . H , belongs to a great and age-old craft the primal. purpose of which has not been gain but the at tempt to illuminate and make understandably the world . And this craft has a past , a present and a future . Therefore , the artist worships mistress greater than himself , and should hI become venal , as so many artists do , in hi ; secret mind he never fools himself ? he know ; he has betrayed his mistress . That is why the motion picture companies , those strange mon sters with the bodies of artists but the heads o business men , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the artists with whom they deal ; they speak completely different language . That is why most of the executives of the motion picture ; are neurotics , although they do n't know it while most artists are n't . If you tear up anc down the world with only the idea of dividend ; in your head , when you sit down , you go crazy The doctor , the lawyer , the engineer , the mechanic , the farmer ? the whole world ex. cept the business man ? has , generally speak . ing , this sense of something bigger than itself and of being in some self-perpetuating tradition . As I have said , these men when they are venal ? and no doubt many of them are ? are discontented , not because there is nothing there to begin with , but because they have fallen so far short of the vision . The business founders of this country had a far better chance for happiness than have their descendants unless these realize their predicament and set about solving it . The men who built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontier were quite obviously worshiping something bigger than themselves . They were often terrible men , far less ethical , generous , and broad-minded than the business man of to-day ? but they did n't retire . The most curious feature of this whole discussion is the core of it . In the beginning , due again no doubt to its lowly position , business stepped off on the wrong foot . It is odd that the business man , having to do with money , knows less about it than almost anyone else . And so , not knowing what money is , is unable to put his finger on the principal thing that is troubling him . At the very heart of the trouble with business is the present conception of profit . Money is nothing . It is neither bread , wine , nor love . It is neither beauty nor use . If you plant it it will not grow , and if you give it away it has no regret at the parting . It is a symbol and an exchange , and a symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define it . And a man can not worship a symbol alone unless he is such a mystic that he is beyond the calculations of ordinary humanity . The Russian peasant could worship an icon , and the miser can worship money in itself , but the average intelligent American business man is neither a Russian peasant nor a miser . Most certainly he is neither a symbolist nor a mystic . Money is worth only what you can buy with it , and if for the most of your life you have been concentrating only upon money , how have you trained yourself to make the real bargain when it comes ? What are you retiring to ? A man can buy only what is already in his brain . What you have been doing is exactly this : you have been walking along a beach collecting shells . While you were collecting them , the process , possibly , was exciting and sufficiently enthralling , but when you are through you have only ? shells . Once more , although greatly more fatigued , you are at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the old argument that it is well for the business man to retire , but that , while still in business , he should cultivate other interests and so be able to retire with trained tastes and an active mind . This is very charming , and better than nothing , and the present-day business ' man is , on the whole , following this advice . Most business men do cultivate their minds and train their hobbies . Golf is a hobby . But this does not answer the main question at all . A man should not train himself to retire from business ; he should train himself to stay in business . But before men will wish generally to stay in business , business will have to make itself as universally satisfying as the arts , the professions , and the trades . I do not wish to draw too roseate a picture of the state of mind of the world outside of business . Man is born to discontent and a constant complaining about his job . The grapes on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument to prove that in most other pursuits there is a satisfaction the average business man does not find . You CAN put this question of profit in another way . Man has three fundamental passions : reproduction , food , and the making of himself comfortable in a hostile environment . From the last , mixed with the first , civilized man 's aesthetic impulses arise . Business , as far as I can make out , is the only preoccupation of man that has attempted to concentrate solely on food , and no wise man needs to be told that man can not live by bread alone . At once most modern business men will arise to state , and angrily , that profit is by no means the primary object in most modern business . That modern business is greatly caught up in improving its products , its services , in the condition of its workers , and a dozen other worthwhile and unselfish objects . Furthermore , most modern business men will say that the principal reason they wish to retire is through no fault of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may wish to live in the country , for instance . The latter objection can be answered briefly . With the present means of transportation and communication , business can make for itself any kind of environment it wishes ; also it can control its leisure and its hours ; even its tempo . If the business man works in a sunless canyon and at a feverish pace , it is his fault and the fault of his fellow business men . The first objection can be answered briefly , too . However altruistic and enlightened modern business may be , or is likely to become , it starts with the idea of profit , whereas the rest of the world does not . Money is pleasant and necessary ; at least , it is necessary as life is now conducted . But , since it has no real value and is merely a symbol , money can not be the main object of any sensible man 's life . It is a byproduct . Once again it is odd that the business man who considers himself a hard-headed fellow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chases a will-o ' - the- wisp and talks the langauge of abracadabra . The vaguest artist is a stern realist in comparison . Finally , the philosophically minded business man suffers from a sense of power abused , a disturbing thought to the philosophically minded man . If you have power , you must use it wisely , and know why you are using it , and toward what end . Otherwise you are baffled and at a loss . Even the stupidest absolute monarch is unhappy if he abuses his power and fails to use it constructively . Business now possesses the world . It can . do exactly what it wants . It can stop war tomorrow ; it can equalize economic conditions ; it can grant opportunity to everyone ; it can make this world physically an almost flawless place in which to live . And since we have now come to the conclusion that this life is important , these would seem to be important things to do . But in order even to start , business will first have to organize itself as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will have to evolve a general philosophy , and from this philosophy , a compelling tradition . First of all , it will have to understand , philosophically , what money and profit are . We have , so far as we know , just one life to lead ; at least , only one life on this planet . It is absurd , especially if we have any power , not to live it as beautifully , decently , and contentedly as we can . There is enough inherent discontent and horror in life itself without adding to them . And if you possess a mind , you can not kill these thoughts . . . not all the time . . . not even by golf .  |
