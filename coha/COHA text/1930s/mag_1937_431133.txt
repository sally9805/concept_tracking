IT WAS four o'clock in the morning when a friend of mine awoke from a troubled sleep . He had dreamer that his son , away at college , had broken his ankle in football scrimmage . Soon he fell asleep again , and thought little more of the dream until two days later . Then he received a letter from the boy , saying that he had sprained his ankle . Now comes the queerest twist in the story : The following day , a second letter arrived . The ankle had been X-raved . It was not sprained , but fractured ! Not long ago , dispatches from Hawaii told of an equally puzzling occurrence . One night , a Territorial forester , Leslie W. Bryan , dreamed he saw a soldier , ragged and dirty , wandering in a desolate spot on the flanks of the volcano , Mauna Loa . Searching parties had been combing the woods for nearly a week looking for a lost private , Edward Deal . The next morning , Bryan tramped up the side of the mountain , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , and saved his life . How do you explain such occurrences ? Are they merely the result of chance ? Are they simply the products of human credulity and of superstition ? Are they outright hoaxes and frauds ? Or are they evidences of some unexplored region of the mind which holds vast possibilities for the future ? In all parts of the world , scientists are debating these questions . Workers in widely scattered laboratories are concentrating upon new tests for telepathy or the transference of thought or emotion from mind to mind without the aid of the five senses . As a result , recent months have seen exciting develop- , ments in this strange realm of research . Most of us have had puzzling experiences we ca n't explain . We have had the fleeting impression that something which is happening at the moment has happened before . We have found ourselves thinking of some- one we have not seen for months or years , and then have met him shortly afterwards . Frequently , applications for patents on the same invention come in almost simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . " Luther Burbank 's mother once awoke with the conviction that a distant neighbor , who had not even been ill , had died during the night . A few hours later , news reached the Burbank home that the neighbor had died the night before . Almost every family has some recollection of the kind . Science is vastly interested in knowing whether such occurrences are caprices of chance or are based on solid laws of psychology . More than half a century ago , Dr. F. W. H. Myers , president of the Society for Psychical Research , in London , coined the word telepathy . Ever since , psychologists have been trying to prove or disprove the existence of the phenomena it describes , The earliest recorded systematic experiments of this kind were made by an English clergyman , Rev. P. H. Newnham , and his wife . Identified with later tests are such famous scientists as Sir Oliver Lodge , the British physicist ; William James , American psychologist ; Sir William Crookes , inventor of the Crookes tube ; and Alexis Carrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crookes , who originated the idea of " brain waves . " ( P.S. M. , May ' 36 , p. 11. ) believed that these infinitesimal pulsations of electricity offer a key to the mystery of telepathy . One " lone wolf " experimenter . J. W. Dunne , a pioneer British airplane designer , slept for years with a notebook under his pillow . As soon as he awoke each morning , he would jot down every dream he could remember . Later , he published the results of his studies in a fascinating volume called " An Experiment in Time . " In half a dozen instances , events that he dreamed about were reported in the news as actual happenings the next day or shortly thereafter . Thus , Dunne " witnessed " a great fire in Paris , 250 miles away ; he " saw " the terrible volcanic explosion on the island of Martinique ; he was " present " when a lost Cape-to-Cairo expedition reached Khartoum , in Africa . One explanation that came to his mind was that he might be in telepathic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , London 's " Newspaper Row . " In almost any library , you can run across volumes filled with similar experiences , bizarre and mystifying . But , objects the skeptic , what do they prove ? The one dream or premonition that comes true is featured in the headlines ; the thousands that do not are never heard of . Take , for instance , the case of the Spanish woman who dreamed that the number she held in a lottery would win the prize . It did . Newspapers all over the world carried the story . Later , a scientist investigated and found that nearly 100 other ticket holders in the same lottery also had dreamed that their numbers would carry off the prize ! It is the batting average , the long-range statistics , that tell the story in scientific research . To obtain evidence of value , the misses as well as the hits must be recorded . It is this that recent experimenters have sought to do . Dr. J. E. Coover. at Leland Stanford University in California ; Dr. Gardner Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estabrooks , of Harvard University in Massachusetts , and I ' Joseph B. Rhine , of Duke University - North Carolina , among others , have but piling up statistics of the kind . Not infrequently , these tests have se sawed between a positive and a negative answer to the question of the existence telepathy . One of the first apparent shattered a common belief . Dr. Coover picked ten students who were certain that they could tell when anyone stared at them from behind . One at a time , he placed them in the laboritory with their backs to him and at a given signal had them note down whether they thought they were being looked at or not . Tossing dice to determine whether it . would stare at the subjects , he gave each student 100 trials . The results for the 1,000 tests showed the answers we : rarely correct , and there is little to substantiate the common belief that w. can " feel " the starof others . During researches at Harvard , Dr. Estabrooks worked in .. soundproof room and had distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck were red or black Other explorers in this twilight zone of psychology have employed many other methods . Some have used the radio , having listeners write down what then thought the scientists were concentrating upon at the broadcasting studio . Others have tasted different flavors , or  | have pinched themselves in various parts of the body , or have concentrated upon drawings sealed in opaque envelopes , all tabulating the hits and misses of the subjects . The most definite evidence for telepathy has been reported from Duke University . Here , Dr. Rhine and his assistants have repeated tests with a pack of special cards 100,000 times . The results obtained in those tests form the big news in telepathy research . They have indicated that every one has some telepathic ability and that a few people are specially gifted . They have shown that telepathic ability seems to run in families . And they have revealed curious facts about the effects of worry and fatigue and drugs upon the scores made in the tests . When , for example , subjects took caffeine . a stimulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a depressant , the scores fell . In some little-understood way , the nervous system of the body was playing its part in the results . Again , the distance which separated the subjects seemed to have little effect upon the scores . The marks were just as high if they were 100 miles apart as when they were separated by only a few feet . When I visited Dr. Rhine 's laboratory , not long ago , one of the most dramatic tests so far attempted was under way . In a quiet room on an upper floor of one of the university buildings , a man sat at a desk holding a specially adjusted watch in one hand . As the second hand swung past the sixty mark , he lifted a card from a small pack lying before him . On its face was a large star . For sixty seconds , he gazed intently at the card . Then he laid it down and took up another card , and so on through the pack . Three thousand miles away , on the Pacific coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a synchronized watch in the other . At the exact time the North Carolina scientist was looking at the star , the California subject was noting down which of five designs ? a star , a cross , wavy lines , a rectangle , and a circle ? that appear on the cards of the pack , he thought had been selected . Paradoxically enough , early returns from these tests show higher scores than many previously made with the subjects separated by only a screen ! In all his tests , Dr. Rhine has used twenty-five cards in a pack , five of each design . Thus , on every " call , " or try , the subject has one chance in five of being right , just by luck . If , the scientist reasoned , enough tests are made , the average number of correct calls must flatten itself to the chance level of five in twentyfive if luck alone controls the result . If , however , in a large number of trials , the scores rise above this level , it will prove some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is playing a part . So much for his plan . Now let 's examine the results . One of the first men to take the test was A. J. Lintzmayer , a Duke University psychology student . In his first 600 calls . he got .238 right ? almost exactly twice as many as chance allowed him . Even more spectacular was the performance of Hubert Pearce , a divinity student at the university . He took 11,250 tests and averaged nine correct in every twenty-five from beginning to end . Once , Pearce correctly called thirty-five cards in succession . More significant than records of the star performers are the figures for the whole 100.000 tests . Including the marks of dozens of subjects , the average runs at more than seven right in twenty-five . To approach the problem from as many angles as possible , Dr. Rhine has varied the tests widely , always using the same kind of cards . In some cases , the subject writes down his calls , in others he puts his finger or pencil on the indicated design . in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window holding the design he has picked . Sometimes , calls are made in time with the clicking of a metronome to see if the speed of decision affects the results . By shuffling the cards in an automatic  | electric device which slides them back and forth across baffle plates , the human element is eliminated from this phase of the work . At least a dozen colleges and universities in all parts of the United States , at this writing , are cooperating in the Rhine tests . In the greatest mass attack yet attempted , they are penetrating into this mysterious realm of psychology . Much remains to be done . There is , for example , the question of the part that emotion plays in telepathy . One curious occurrence , reported from Harvard University , illustrates the possibilities which may lie in this direction . DURING one of his experiments , Dr. Estabrooks was using a valued pack of playing cards . As he cut and selected a card , a leaky fountain pen splashed ink all over it , ruining it . The scientist was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of the subject , he found the name of this card correctly listed , with a star placed in the marbeside it . The subject said that in this case the impression had come with such unusual force that he had starred the call to see if there had been anything peculiar about the circumstances of the card 's selection ! In everyday life , emotion ? which is usually absent in cold-blooded laboratory tests ? may be the factor responsible for the spectacular occurrences which we are at a loss to explain . It was such an occurrence , Dr. Rhine told me , that started him on his researches . When he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago , a famous botanist told him thisstory : One stormy night , a woman on a midwestern farm dreamed she saw her brother drive into his barn , nine miles away , climb into the hayloft , pull a pistol from his pocket and fire a bullet through his brain . So vivid was the nightmare that she awoke screaming and insisted that her husband drive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all right . There they found the body in the loft . Every detail of the suicide , evidence showed , was exactly as the sister had seen it in her dream ! The botanist was a trained and skeptical scientist . He had lived in the community at the time . He had checked up on the facts first-hand . And he was baffled for an explanation . Even granting that the woman was worrying over her brother 's mental condition , how could science explain the fact that the dream was correct in every detail ? Was there , after all , some kernel of scientific truth . n telepathy , so long travestied by vaudeville fakers and , professional frauds ? THAT was the question that haunted Dr. Rhine , the question he set out to answer in his present tests . For more than six years , these experiments have been going on . Climaxing the researches of other scientists , in many parts of the world , they provide the first long-range statistics in the study of telepathy . These advances , reported in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious and unmapped regions of the human mind .  |
