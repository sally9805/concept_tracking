In 1923 , a plump , impudent artfully infantile young woman named Helen Kane began to appear in vaudeville . In her songs she usually replaced the lyrics with extraordinary noises . Presently her favorite noise , " boop-boop-a-doop , " became a recognized word in vaudeville 's nonsense language . By 1928 , Helen Kane had innumerable imitators . In 1931 , there appeared in animated cinema cartoons a character called Betty Boop . <P> Helen Kane grew fatter . Her infantilism grew less appropriate and profitable . Betty Boop remained babyish , alert , and so prosperous that her name has lately become almost as familiar in Manhattan courtrooms as that of Ella Wendel . Last month , Producer Max Fleischer whose firm makes Betty Boop cartoons , distributes them through Paramount , successfully sued a doll manufacturer for imitating Betty Boop . Last week it was Producer Fleischer and Paramount Publix Corp . who were sued by Helen Kane for $250,000 for copying her voice and mannerisms . <P> Justice Edward J. McGoldrick ruled against a jury . Counsel ordered Helen Kane to remove her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleischer produced three babyfaced young women who do the singing for Betty Boop cartoons . A court anteroom was darkened and three Betty Boop cartoons and one reel of a Helen Kane picture were projected on the wall . After this , Justice McGoldrick ruled that he had had enough , demanded records and music sung by Helen Kane and Betty Boop before he made a decision . Grown fatter but still talking with the voice of an indignant doll , Helen Kane explained her difficulties : <P> " I have become a ghost . Recently in Hollywood when some children ran to open the door of my car they greeted me as Betty Boop . Betty is just one stroke removed from Mickey Mouse . "
