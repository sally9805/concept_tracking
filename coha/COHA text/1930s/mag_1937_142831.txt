Slim ( Warner ) is a story of electric linemen , the high-wire workers employed in constructing and repairing the country 's power lines . With minimum resort to dramatic contrivance , it presents certain interlocking episodes in the lives of Linemen Red Blayd ( Pat O'Brien ) and Slim ( Henry Fonda ) . It begins when Slim , a farm boy fascinated by the hazardous function of the linemen putting up a transmission tower , asks for a job ; it ends , after Red falls to his death in a high-wire accident , with Slim climbing a tower in a blizzard to resume the repair job thus interrupted . Told with a drawling , mournful humor , the film builds up to a little epic in the sardonic idiom of one of the world 's most necessary , most dangerous , least publicized trades . <P> Slim got his job because a butter-fingered lineman dropped a condenser and got fired . Red Blayd liked him . Red was independent as a king . He was the most respected man on that power job . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footloose life , wandering from one line job to another , working until he had a roll and then living high until he had to go to work again . First Slim was Red 's " grunt " ( groundman ) . Slim sent up tools as needed on the hand line , tossed up bolts which Red caught with the nonchalant magnificence of a big-league outfielder . When a lineman with a hangover dropped off a tower and got killed , Slim stopped being a grunt . He was so proud of his lineman 's belt he hated to take it off at night . Because Red would n't stand for any big lip from the man sent to investigate the accident , he and Slim headed Red 's old car for Chicago . <P> Cally ( Margaret Lindsay ) was a nurse who had taken care of Red when he was hurt once . In Chicago , he always looked her up . Cally taught Slim to dance . Talking to Red was no use , but Cally tried to get Slim to quit line work . Slim turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On their next job there was a fight . Wilcox ( Joseph Sawyer ) , a lineman jealous of Red 's prestige , tried to loosen the line that was dropping Red . Slim got to Wilcox in time . He and Wilcox were both hurt . When Slim wrote the news to Cally , she came out to nurse him . She fixed it for him to have a job in maintenance , where he could stay put and raise a family . Once more Slim thought he 'd go with Red , so Cally called off their wedding . Climax in the contest between love for Cally and the job of being a lineman came in the power-house yard on a snowy night , with the ends of hot wire , broken by the cold and the weight of ice on them , flapping in the wind till the high voltage lines nearby , on which they struck , short-circuited like torches , with the blast of a million electric chairs , That was when Slim , after Red 's body fell across the wires and exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower again .
