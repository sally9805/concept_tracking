While sheiks gaped , burros reared and camels stopped chewing their cuds , over the long yellow ripples of the Syrian Desert at 65 m.p.h. last week whizzed a vehicle the like of which neither Iraq nor any other place in the world had ever seen . It was the world 's first stainless-steel sleeper-trailer bus , built in Philadelphia by E. G. Budd Manufacturing Co. for the 600-mile run between Bagdad and Damascus . On this long trip with its one watering place-the oasis at Rutba Wells-the road is marked for only 200 miles . <P> Rest of the way is over the trackless sands . Lightness was therefore a prime consideration . E. G. Budd Co. followed the formula that has made it the most successful U. S. builder of lightweight streamline trains . Some 57 ft. long , its desert car consists of a shiny , Diesel-powered tractor to which is coupled a 36-ft. trailer shaped much like the observation car on Budd streamline trains . Operated by Nairn Transport Co. , the new busses , of which there are two , make the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , conventional busses Nairn has been shuttling across the desert for 14 years . A passenger boards the bus late in the afternoon , takes a seat in a modern interior designed like a standard Pullman . Until nightfall he watches the flat Syrian terrain from , one of 17 windows . After a box supper , a native steward makes up the 14 upper and lower berths . To guard against sandstorms , the whole machine is airtight . To guard against temperatures varying from zero to 140 F. , there is air conditioning . Fare : $50 . <P> *Example : The owners of Chicago 's Merchandise Mart paid $2,500,000 to Chicago &; North Western R. R. whose yards the building straddles.
