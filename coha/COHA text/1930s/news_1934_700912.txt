txt Complimentary . I want to express my admiration for this " land of freedom " where the newspapers are free from government control . Here the business of a newspaper is primarily to gather and publish all the news , to subject it to critical examination , to see what is significant and then , reasonably and intelligently , to inter pret it . I wish this policy , which appears to be most nearly , realized in THE NEW YORK TIMES , could be ' understood across the Atlantic , where newspapers are still organs of personal opinion . In Europe people seem to have an educated sense of political criticism . That is , they try to get this from their newspapers , which are to them more of a guide than a source of information . We love your country . What makes us love it is the kindness of the intelligent , understanding people we have met here . FOREIGN VISITOR . New York , Dec. 5 , 1934.               @ @ @ @ @ @
