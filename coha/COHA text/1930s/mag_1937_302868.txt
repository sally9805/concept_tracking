In Cambridge , Mass. , where he is preparing to take over the job of dean of the Harvard Law School , James McCauley Landis fortnight ago delivered his matured opinion of the work of the Securities &; Exchange Commission of which he is retiring chairman : " More than a billion dollars of American money has been kept from falling into the hands of swindlers through SEC operations to date . . . . And the amount of other millions of fraudulent , or semi-fraudulent investments deterred by SEC activities from even trying to ' get by ' can only be estimated . . . . I do not think basic soundness of our markets has been impaired by restrictions for the protection of customers and lessening of the speculative tinge . It may be-who can tell ? - that there will be sharper short-term deviations-fluctuations that concern the speculator rather than the investor-but I think the danger of runaway markets and also of dangerously inflated markets has been greatly decreased . Present markets tend to make investors think very much less in terms of capital appreciation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management . " <P> Last week , without challenging the merit of SEC 's efforts to purify the issuance of new securities , the New York Stock Exchange , which has never openly attacked SEC , and Charles R. Gay ( called the Exchange 's " New Deal " president ) broadly and frankly questioned the results of SEC 's regulation of securities exchanges . <P> Said Mr. Gay in his annual report : " I am fearful that , in an effort to cure what might be termed sporadic evils , undue restraints are being placed upon normal , proper action , thus creating abnormal market conditions . Evidence accumulates that the quality of the market has been seriously affected . With muc concern I note the continuance of narrow , illiquid markets in which wide spreads between bid and asked quotations prevail and in which comparatively small volumes of buying or selling create undue fluctuations in prices . Almost daily , situations are called to my attention wherein it is impossible to buy or sell reasonable amounts of stock at reasonable prices . Orders which , a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a few hours now often require days and sometimes weeks , with resulting increased risk to the owner . . . . " <P> Almost every broker in Wall Street has for months been talking this way in private . Reason at this time for speaking publicly was fear that the SEC would soon inaugurate its " segregation plan " announced last June . To achieve an investment market and reduce speculation , the SEC proposed , by segregating the functions of broker and dealer , to reduce the kind of quick-turnover buying and selling which these professionals practice . Unless a " valid case " against it were presented by the Exchange , Chairman Landis declared he would achieve this by : 1 ) placing all trading by members , on the floor or off , for their own account on a fully margined basis-forcing them to put up cash instead of allowing them to buy in and sell out on the same day without putting up any money at all ; 2 ) placing all trading by commission houses for their own accounts on an outright cash basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks .
