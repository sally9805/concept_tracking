W HEN Secretary Ickes says it may be necessary to transfer some of the activities of government from Washington to a near-by city , like Baltimore , what does that mean ? It means that the boom in government is about . to burst its housing . How does a boom in government differ from a boom in anything else ? In certain respects , the boom that began in government in March , 1933 , has been true to the native form . The boom is an American folkway . Nothing gradual . Pike 's Peak or bust . That is why we have passed so much of our national life in states of repentance and depression . We know enough about booms to know better . We make believe to dread them , as a dipsomaniac dreads intoxication , but it turns out that we dread only the consequences . We want the boom without . the depression . And that may account for the curious fact that a boom never is until it was . Never yet a boom that was to be , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . When , nevertheless , a boom is , and all the consequences are inevitable , then we deceive ourselves by proving that it is nonexistent . It is not a boom at all . It is something else . The wildest boom in the history of Wall Street was not a boom until it crashed . Until then it was the New Era . The fundamental meaning of values had changed , and there were never to be any consequences . After that , the worst post-boom depression since the modern economic world began . So this boom in government . is not , although it is . The reason why it is not is that it was not to be , and because Because it has clothed itself with a name and a theory of immortality . Not only was it not to he . The incipiency of it was to he dealt with as it deserved . The Democratic Party platform in 1932 said : " We advocate an immediate and drastic reduction of governmental expenditures by abolishing useless commissions and offices , consolidating departments and bureaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 25 per cent in the cost of Federal Government . " The New-Deal World I N ACCEPTING the nom- ination , Mr. Roosevelt said : " We must eliminate actual perfunetions of government  --  functions , in fact , that are not definitely essential to the continuance of government . We must merge , we must consolidate subdivisions of government , and , like the private citizen , give up luxuries which we can no longer afford . " Later , in a speech de-livered at Pittsburgh , Mr. Roosevelt said : " . . we can make savings by reorganization of existing departments , by eliminating functions , by abolishing many of the innumerable boards and commissions . " Then what was it happened to start a boom in government ? The discovery of a. new world . What world ? The world we now live in . This world of the New Deal . This is the new government for that new world  --  a government of service , to serve the people , to administer among them the abundant life . It was discovered suddenly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just then ? The only law that governs the discovery of a new world seems to be one of dramatic effect . It must be discovered suddenly , of course , but also it must happen just when it has been decided by vote to turn back and go home . This one was so discovered , just after the people had voted by a very large . majority to have less government by at least one-quarter and return to the world we had before . Then what happened ? Then , instead of the deflation of government that people had voted for , the boom  --  and , true to the American genius , the great boom in the history of human government . How can it be measured ? In less than three years the number of governmental agencies has been more than doubled . That is to say , more new agencies have been created in this sudden time than during all of the 144 years of American government before . The Civil Service Commission accounts for thirty-five . The United States Manual accounts for forty-three . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one like the AAA  --  may be , in fact , a system of agencies or bureaus , and for the reason , besides , that new bureaus have been set up within old agencies . How many people were added to the public pay roll ? The total number of civil officers and bureau workers employed by all executive and administrative agencies of government existing prior to March , 1933 ? and this includes the Treasury , the State Department , the War Department , the Navy Department , the Department of Justice , the Interior Department , the Department of Commerce , the Post Office Department , the Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture  --  was approximately 600,000 . The total number of civil officers and bureau workers employed by the forty-three odd new agencies is approximately 190,000 . The Army of the Potomac T HUS , the number of civil officers and bureau workers has been increased nearly one-third in less than three years , and it is still rising . And the aggregate net pay roll of what the Civil Service Commission calls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total sum of nearly $1,500,000,000 a year . This is for civil officers and bureau workers only . It does not include the enrolled personnel of the Army and Navy ; it does not include the 500,000 men enrolled in CCC camps ; it does not include anyone receiving Federal money as relief or work-relief wages . Nor does it include the congressional and judicial establishments . It is the physical expansion of government that Secretary Ickes is talking about ? Yes . During the three years of depression that had passed before March , 1933 , a program of public building in Washington was energetically carried on , not because the Government needed the space , but because the capital architects , happily , had prepared a magnificent plan , designed to anticipate the needs of government for at least a generation ; and to move it . rapidly in a time of economic depression was a matter of good common sense . Thus , after the new dependents of these ; secondly , those who necessarily pertain to the life of a city  --  tradesmen , shopkeepers , purveyors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the garage race , tourists , guides , local police , and so on  --  who are all there only because the others are . An expansion in the activities of government , therefore , produces a multiple effect . As the primary elements increase , so must all the other elements increase in proportion . Everybody lives on government . Such an expansion as did take place , suddenly , was like the discovery of gold in a gold town or the bringing in unexpectedly of a string of new gushers in an oil town . And before the New Deal , had Washington been feeling the depression ? Extremely . When the Republican Administration departed , in March , 1933 , Washington , like nearly every other city , had the appearance of being overbuilt . The principal hotels and most of the new apartment houses were either in bankruptcy or staring at it . Private houses could be had for the taxes and upkeep . Many mansions were boarded up . Shops were closing , leaving whitened plate-glass windows behind them . Your taxi fare was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grateful that you were ashamed . Elsewhere people might still he hopeful , not knowing the worst ; but here , with all the sources drying up , it was not . going to rain for four more years . Was not the incoming Administration pledged to lay the ax against government and cut it down one-quarter ? And now what is it like ? Golden Rain Department of Commerce building , so big that the Democrats referred to it as Hoover 's Folly , came the other buildings that now make Constitution Avenue , facing the Mall , the most impressive street of its kind in the world , housing in monumental architecture the Interstate Commerce Commission , the Department of Labor , the Bureau of Internal Revenue , the Department of Justice , the Post Office Department and the Establishment of Archives . Then , across the Mall , the new Department of Agriculture , and , immediately back of it , the Agricultural Extensible Building , which alone has five miles of corridor . So there was a surplus of space for the boom that was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a trifling vacuum . An apparent surplus , yes , It may be the wrong idea to anticipate the needs of government for space . Idle space , like idle money , may be in itself a temptation . In any case , the Administration that was pledged to cut government one-quarter filled all of this new space in a few weeks , with its additions to government . Flowing as far as it could go in that direction , it began to flow backward and filled up all the old buildings again . These were not enough . It began to rent space in private office buildings . That was not enough . Then it began to rent unoccupied private mansions . Three of these : the McLean mansion , the Walsh mansion and the Blaine mansion . responsible for housing the Government , had a survey made of all the remaining space that might be rented in Washington , and it was not enough . For example , the new Social Security Board , now camping in the Department of Labor , will need for itself within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square feet of floor space . This is the point at which Secretary Ickes says it may be necessary to transfer some activities to Baltimore and make a Washington annex there . What of the environment in which all of this takes place ? Washington is the only city in the world entirely devoted to government . It has no other business . The elements of its population are few . First , those who possess the offices and conduct the Government , those for worse and better who would possess the offices and conduct the Government , and the natural rilHEN it rained . Mi1 raculous rain from an invisible cloud in a new world . First the hotels filled up and overflowed . Next all the apartments and private houses were taken and they were not enough . Rents began to rise . The closed shops reopened . New ones appeared . Walking on errands of government ceased , because everyone was so earnestly making haste in the new world . The leisurely , old-fashioned left turn , wide around on the red light , had to be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing to the increase of motor traffic . Taxicabs multiplied prodigiously . Gaiety took back its place in the life  --  eating , drinking and dancing , with all the most expensive places crowded ; and touching all of this a kind of guilty embarrassment , as of people taking pleasure in unreconciled circumstances . Not that so many of them were new to government and had arrived without apprenticeship . That was not it . Many of them , especially the younger ones , came to government very earnestly disbelieving in wealth and with ideas of how to distribute it in the new world quite contrary to the ways in which they found themselves now making a distribution of it for purposes of their own private and socially unequal enjoyment , as if it were still the old world . You mean there has been a noticeable change in people  --  a change in kind and character ? The emblematic face of government changed all at once . What is the emblematic face of government ? Each succeeding administration brings to Washington a new composite face . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Pure 135 ) NEW COFERNMENY Continued from Page 9 ) course , no such thing definitely as a Republican face or a Democratic face . A composite profile made up of all the official faces of one Republican administration would differ from the profile of another Republican administration ; and yet very much less than the face of any Republican administration would differ from the composite face of any Democratic administration . However , here suddenly was a face unknown . It was not Republican ; it was not Democratic . It was not a political face at all . Its character was academic , and not positively masculine , owing to the admixture of so many feminine faces , also of the intellectual cast . How may that he explained ? Such would be the effect of a sudden extension of bureaucratic government on ideas that were provided , not by the politician , not by the statesman , but by the scholastic mentality , acting upon a sympathetic President . The boom in government , then , was not for the politician ? It belittled him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin as this , hanging in a public place : " Notice of Civil Service Examination . One Senior Social Economist , 84600 ; one Social Economist , $3800 ; one Associate Social Economist , 83200 ; one Assistant Social Economist , 82600 . " A requisition , that is , from some new bureau making up its personnel . Or he might go and buy himself a leather brief ease to carry around , thinking thereby to associate himself , visibly at least , with the rising new intellectual power in government , yet he would deceive neither himself nor anyone else . It is not the brief ease alone ; there is a manner to go with it . The brief case without the manner is absurd . New Niches for Theorists The boom in government , therefore , was for such as had never taken part in government before ? For social , economic and administrative scientists who for years had been writing what they knew in hooks or teaching it in classrooms to others who would in turn write it in books or teach it in classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To these the astonishing expansion of bureaucratic government , in the spirit of their own frustrated ideas , was , indeed , the opening of a new world . It meant not gold , not land , not oil , but refuge , career , power , access to achievement . What else might have become of them ? The Attorney General of the United States , Homer Cummings , asked that question . Writing eloquently of administrative government , meaning bureaucratic government , and the necessity for it in order that government may meet the modern idea of its enlarged relations to the public welfare , seeing , " after all , this is a new world we inhabit , " he said : " This , of course , creates a widening area of activity for young men i if they will equip them- selves for it as deliberately as they do for service in the occupational world . ? . . Then , too , it might be well to consider these new opportunities from the point of view suggested by the amazing statistics recently assembled which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of college graduates is increasing as compared to the number of available positions . Well , here is the Government , Federal and state , that will be all the better for the educated man , from Cabinet officer to policeman . . . So , instead of trying to crash the gates of occupations already overcrowded , why not enter the wider areas where the space is ample and the need is great ? " Does that mean government as a refuge for the surplus of mass educa-tion ? Those who have been unfitted by the higher education for the occupations , or those who have been educated beyond the needs of the occupational world  --  these shall govern . Historically , it is a natural sequel . An educational system teaching theories of government as a science produces what is potentially a governing caste . It is contemptuous of practical polities because practical politics is contemptuous of its ideas and frustrates them . The pressure upon government to adopt its ideas , however , tends to become irresistible . The adoption begins gradually , and involves an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the kind of power the ideas require . The beginning is like a wedge . As government extends itself more and more in the form of a bureaucratic system , the civil service rises in power and prestige until it becomes not only the main path to career and social advancement but in itself an aristocracy and a cult . Almost , therefore , one might speak of the rush of the intellectuals ? The rush to seize the opportunities in the spacious world of new government created in the city of Washington a famine of small dwellings . The ancient capitalistic myth of supply and demand , even as in the old world , acted on the price of habitations . There was the irony of bureau workers engaged in the Federal program of slum clearance and subsidized low-rental housing for low-income people in New York , Atlanta and elsewhere , themselves seeking slum dwellings in Washington , and trying , in a spirit of social adventure and with the aid of exterminators , to make them do . There was the irony also that with its employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cornpeting with them for housing space , even putting them out of second-class hotels because it needed the hotels for more Government bureaus . How to house the Government was the imperative problem . When one speaks of a boom in government , is there not an inflection of prejudice ? Is it not possible to suppose that there has been a release of the zeal for public service ? Quite possible . However , a disinterested , self-sacrificing zeal for public service is not yet one of the ordinary human emotions . Proficiency in what we call the social sciences certainly is no witness of it . In the rare and valid case there is no boasting of it . And when there is an aggressive sell-assertion of it , you may suspect that it mistakes itself for one or more of the less noble emotions , such as the passion for power , the zeal of one to govern others , the love of station and authority , and a lively affection for the public pay roll . These are very common emotions . Why did the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the people vote for it ? Because the Government had been going into debt . Its expenditures were greater than its revenues . People were fearful that if this continued , public credit would fail ; and that is one of the dire calamities that can happen to an economic society . Also taxes were rising . The only way to keep the Government from going farther into debt and to stop the rise of taxes was to reduce government . Has the new Government stopped going into debt ? To the contrary , in less than three years it has increased the national debt nearly one-third , and it is still rising . Has the rise in taxes been stopped ? Taxes have gone on rising , but not enough to balance the terrific increase of Government expenditures . How are people reconciled to these contradictions ? Partly by the idea that they are living in a new world where nothing counts as it counted in the old world . Is that all ? And by the checks they receive from the Government . So this boom has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Down Boom No gold . It is forbidden for people to have gold . Some silver . But mostly a paper-money lining . Hitherto the similarities have been noticed . But there are peculiarities too . All other booms we know about  --  land booms , oil booms , mining booms , stock booms , and so on  --  are supported by the people , who provide their own delusions . This boom in government is in that sense upside down . People who believe in the boom do not support it ; the boom supports them , besides providing the necessary delusions . If the boom supports the people who believe in it , who supports the boom ? You may put them in three classes . First a small class , called the rich , who possess taxable property and large taxable incomes . These are the most considered and yet almost the least to matter ; for if you took all they possess , it would not begin to be enough to support the boom . In the second class are those who save and all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their savings and their bank deposits , unawares to them . " How is that ? " The Government sells its bonds to the banks . The banks buy them with their depositors ' money . That is to say , simply , the banks lend their depositors ' money to the Government , and the Government spends the money . What if the Government should lose it ? The Government is losing a great deal of it . Yet everyone believes , of course , that somehow the Government will be able to pay it back . That makes , so far , two classes supporting the boom . What is the third class ? The third is a very large though relatively diminishing class . It belongs to the occupational world . It produces all the essential things we consume day by day . This is the class that really supports the boom . How can that be made clear ? When a man engaged in one of the essential occupations receives money for wages , what does that money represent ? It represents the value of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may spend it for , it is for something someone else in the same way has produced by labor , and that someone else at the same time is spending his wage money for whatever essential thing it was this first man produced , and so on and on . Now observe a man who does not belong to the occupational world , one who himself produces no essential thing , and yet receives a check from the Government . What does that money represent ? Not the value of any essential thing he has produced . Not the value of any essential thing the Government has produced , since the Government itself produces nothing . Nevertheless , the man who receives that money from the Government may buy with it whatever essential thing he wants , and whatever that is it will have been produced by those who belong to the occupational world and receive wages . When the Government puts 500,000 men into the CCC camps , it is said to support them . But the Government does not make their clothes , dig their coal , produce their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . When the Government adds 190,000 civil officers and bureau workers to the public pay roll , these constituting a governing caste , it does not produce their sustenance . Only the occupational world can do that . Pathological Signs When it distributes money out of the public treasury to college and high-school students , as the National Youth Administration is doing , it does not produce the things the students buy with that money . Only the occupational world can produce them . When the Government decides that certain classes shall be provided with more , because they are unable for themselves to produce more , the Government does not produce this more . And such as these have always been the pathological signs in human society  --  an expansion of the governing caste , the rise of a great civil service minutely to administer the affairs of people , the appearance of classes receiving benefits , gifts and the means of subsistence from the public treasury , all at the ultimate expense of those who belong to the occupational world , tending to become a producing caste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the checks that go out . Does the Government , like an individual , write the check  --  pay to the order of someone , so much  --  then sign it , fill in the stub , put the check in an envelope and mail it ? It does all of that . But not by hand . To do it by hand would be almost impossible . It is done by mechanical brains . There are electric machines , activated by the holes in punched cards , that write and sign the checks at the rate , it may be , of one per second . Each agency that distributes Government money has a battery of such machines . Various Government agencies independently print and sign checks in that way and send them out ? Yes . But is there no place where they all come together to be accounted for ? Not as they go out . Only as they come back . Just as one 's individual checks , after having been endorsed and cashed , all come back to the bank on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after they have been cashed , come back to the Treasury to he counted . That is the only place where they all come together  --  in the cancellation department of the United States Treasury . There they run through another kind of automatic machine that sorts them into numerical order by holes that were mechanically printed in the checks as they were made out . How many ? The number is approximately 250,000 a day . It is sometimes more and sometimes less , That is approximiate/y the daily average . Each check may be for any sum . Then what do these canceled checks represent in dollars ? Approximately a million dollars an hour , each hour of the twenty-four in a day , every day in the year but Sunday . Since the Government is spending more than it receives in the way of taxes and revenue , and has to borrow the difference , is it possible at this point to say at what speed it is going into debt ? It is . Each dollar represented by these canceled ehecks may be divided in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue coming in to the Government ; forty-two cents of it represents borrowing on Government bonds at the banks . So , if the canceled checks represent a million dollars an hour , the speed at which the Government is going into debt is 8420,000 an hour , each hour of the twenty-four in a day , every day of the year but Sunday . How many people are receiving money from the Government ? The number has to be estimated . The Government itself does not know exactly . The approximate number is 9,000,000 . How does that compare with what the number was at a time before ? In 1932 the number of people receiving money from the Government was approximately 2,000,000 , this including the Army and the Navy and all those receiving civil and military pensions . How is the responsibility for the increase of 7,000,000 in three years distributed among the different agencies of Government ? The AAA accounts for approximately 3,000,000 , the CCC for 500 , - 000 , the WPA for 3,000,000 , the increase of civil officers and bureau workers for 190,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 6,990,000 . How many more the PWA accounts for indirectly , it is hard to say , because the PWA money is distributed to states and municipalities , and these in turn distribute it to the individuals . Those are the principal items . Government Agencies How does the number of 9,000.000 people receiving money from the Government compare with the numbers engaged in the different divisions of the occupational world ? According to the census figures , the number of people employed in all man-ufacturing and machine industries in 1930 was 12,224,000 : in agriculture , 9,562.000 ; in transportation , 3,562,000 . If you suppose that each of the 9,000 , - 000 receiving money from the Government has , on the average , two dependents , then you have 27,000,000 depending on the United States Treasury , and that is not far from a quarter of the total population . Has not the extraordinary increase in the activities of the Government been almost entirely of an emergency nature , for relief of the unemployed in a time of acute distress ? Such is the cultivated impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of relief , the Federal Government for the first time assuming responsibility for it in place of the states and cities . But if we take , say , forty-seven of the new agencies and group them by their several natures , this is what appears : Agencies primarily concerned with emergency relief of human distress from unemployment  --  seven . Agencies representing new social policy  --  one entirely in that meaning , and several others , elsewhere noted , in which the meaning is implicit . Agencies to control prices , wages , work , production , distribution , competition and commerce  --  nine .. Agencies representing the active competitive presence of Government in fithrnaene. c e , trade and business  --  twenty- Agencies of a miscellaneous chaoticter  --  seven . What are the seven agencies in the first group ? ( Continued on Page 681 THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page 66 ) The agencies primarily concerned with emergency relief of human distress from unemployment , taking them in alphabetical order , are these : ECW .

Agencies in other groups implicitly or obliquely represent new social policies .
