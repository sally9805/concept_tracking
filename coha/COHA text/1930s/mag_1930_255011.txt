Two years ago Exhibitor Florence B Ilch got a telegram that said : " Your son died this morning . " Mrs. Ilch fainted beside her collies at the Westminster Kennel Club show ; later learned that her son was alive and well , that the telegram had been a fake . This year Exhibitor Madeline Frank 's collie , Black Pirate , lay down on his bench , vomited , and after a convulsion of his sleek body , ruffled with white at the chest , closed his eyes and died . Exhibitor Frank said she was sure he had been poisoned . Aside from this incident the show went on with proper dignity . Amid the smell of chlorine that effaces the natural smell of dogs , flanked by rows of booths where biscuits , whips , brushes , blankets , Spratts food , worm medicine and Old Trusty were offered for sale , hundreds of thoroughbreds paraded through Madison Square Garden to be judged . <P> Chows . Red Cloud III , a male with a coarse pelt , bred in the U. S. by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winners . Mrs. David Wagstaff 's Ledgelands ' Nyan Lok beat the other bitches . <P> Collies .

Best in the puppy class was Punch , son of Judy , a polite , muscular dog with a deep body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by William E. Schratweiser . <P> Samoyede .

Jacob Ruppert , onetime brewer , owner of the Yankee Baseball team , entered his Hercuveen Satellite but was beaten by Pythagora Junior of Berncrest Kennels . <P> Best in Show . Champions of six classes-a Pekingese , a wire-haired fox terrier , a beagle , an English bulldog , a shepherd and an Irish setter-paraded at last .
