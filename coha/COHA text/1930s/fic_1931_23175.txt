SEARCH FOR MR . LOO A STORY BY STELLA BENSON M RS . MARY LOO had not found it difficult to persuade the Captain to let her and Cutty go ashore on Chinchang Island . This is one of the compensations attached to being pitied  --  people do things for you that you want done , even if they do not want to do them . But in this case what Mary Loo wanted done was not difficult to do . The little steamer could not in any case manage to reach her berth in Hongkong harbor before nightfall , so her captain was as willing to await the proper time and tide off Chinchang as anywhere else . " You wo n't find him on Chinchang , " said the Captain . " How could you possibly find him ? There is n't any foreign settlement there and only a handful of Chinese peasants . " Throughout the voyage the kind Captain had with difficulty refrained from referring disrespectfully to the Chinese , out of pity for Mary whose husband was one . The Captain despised Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those so-called brainy women , he thought contemptuously  --  had been a schoolma'am . Perhaps she had to marry a Chinaman because no white man had wanted her . However , she was not too clever to be a mother and , therefore , the Captain , while still despising her , would certainly have risked his life for her . Young Cutty Lon , a thin , sly-looking child with his Chinese father 's flat-tened , opaque eyes , hummed a song as he sat by his mother 's side in the little boat , being rowed towards the shore . " You 're singing that song wrong , Cutty , " said Mary coldly . " It goes like this  --  Ta-ra-ra  --  not Ta-ra-ra . " " I know , " said Cutty . This retort was his defense against his mother 's superiority  --  a door of escape for his pent vanity . " I should think you 'd have other things to think of than the kid 's singing to-day , Mrs. Loo , " said the serious young Third Officer who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain , felt obliged to despise yet be kind to Mrs. Loo . " Surely it does n't matter how the kid sings his little kiddie songs . In your place , when your luck hangs in the balance , so to speak , I should n't bother with Cutty 's musical education but of course I 'm not a highbrow . " " Thinking of other things does n't make you deaf , " said Mary Loo glumly . " Nobody has any right to sing even a baby-song wrong . If they ca n't sing it they ought to keep silence . If I had no sense of smell , Cutty might wave little baskets of manure under your nose , and I might say you ought to he thinking of other things than smells , he 's only a kiddie , and they 're only little baskets of manure ; you ought to be thinking of your fiancee , not troubling about little smells , I might say . I 'm sure I do n't know why noses should have more rights than ears . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to say . No offense meant . " He made said the poor young man , much con up his mind then not to go ashore with fused by this logical attack , " only in her and see that her inquiries were well your place I should be all of a doo-dah begun , as he had intended . But he ? landing on this queer little shore to was such a very kind young man that as look for your husband that you have n't the boat touched the sand he said , in seen for two years . Flow are you going spite of himself , " I 'll just stroll along to to set about finding him , to begin the village with you and see that you with ? " find somebody who can help you . " To " He will be looking out for the suggest strolling instead of walking ship , " said Mary . " I wrote and told somehow made his good nature seem him Cutty and I would come from less personal  --  less flattering to her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ! How in the world did The first moment that Mary saw the you address the letter ? " first Chinese villager she knew that she " Walter Loo , Esquire , The Turtle had lost her husband  --  lost everything Farm , Chinchang Island , near South ? given up her English security for China . " nothing . She saw all China instantly " But , Mrs. Loo , I doubt very much in the incomprehensible knotted face of if letters get delivered on out-of-the- this young peasant . He trotted along way Chinese islands like this  --  not the sands with a smooth gait , carrying , at any rate letters addressed in Eng on either end of a shoulder-pole , a danlish , with Esquires and all that . . . . gling basket of vegetables . Looking at There 's only a little fishing village on his face , she realized for the first time Chinchang  --  no postmen and suchlike . that she had married a member of an Did n't Mr. Loo give you a proper unknowable race five hundred million address to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aston- " His last address was a boarding ished , at the three strangers . He did not house in Hongkong called Balmoral stand and stare ; his legs carried him inHouse , but his last letter  --  eighteen exorably away as though they were the months ago  --  said , ' I am going to legs of a conscientiously industrious Chinchang Island to start a turtle horse , but his face craned round tofarm. ' " wards them as long as he was in sight . The Third Officer said nothing . Mary and Cutty turned round to stare " It 's not my business , " he thought , and at him . And that exchanged gaze , so felt the more safe and established him reluctantly broken , seemed to Mary to self , for the poor woman 's obvious in build up a high  --  sky-high  --  wall not security . There was a long pause . only between her and her future but Then he said , " Walter Loo  --  it 's rather between her and her past . She could a quaint name  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is n't it ? " was walled in in a void between two " My goodness gracious , " said Mary crowded halls . She walked on somLoo rather violently . " Surely you can berly , holding Cutty 's wrist masterrealize that that joke 's been made be fully , as though she were making sure fore to me  --  again and again and of at least one possession . again . " " I seen a little monkey , " said Cutty , " Oh , I was n't joking , " said the Third twisting and pulling at his captive Officer , his face covered with blushes , wrist . his heart full of hatred . " I was only " This is the only island in these just passing the remark . Something parts that has monkeys in the trees , " said the Third Officer : " Some say the English sailors brought a couple of pet monkeys when they used to use this place as a watering station a hundred years ago . Monkeys are n't natural here , they say . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind , rebounding from the repellent fact of her plight , turned desperately to the matter of monkeys . " It 's a shame putting things where they 're foreign , " she said rather incoherently . " Things ought to be allowed to stop at home , that 's what they ought  --  all this pushing about of monkeys and things from one country to another  --  the idea . . . It 's downright deceitful . " The Third Officer was not interested enough in her trouble to understand the relevance of her protest . " Where would you be in England if us sailors did n't come to foreign parts fetching and carrying ? " he said . " Where should I be in England anyway ? ? " began Mary , but Cutty interrupted , " Fetching and carrying what monkeys ? " " Now silly  --  ca n't you think before you speak ? " cried his ira . ' eible mother . The Third Officer was sorry for the child . " Monkeys and sailors always have been partial to each other , Cutty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey perching on that gravestone . It 's easy to think that may be the grave of the sailor who brought over that monkey 's great-great-grandmamma . " " I know , " said Cutty . " Is it really a gravestone ? " said Mary Loo in a gentler voice . " There 's dozens of ' em here , " said the young man . " Yellow fever was something chronic in the old days here . " Mary 's attention , still desperately avoiding the center of her fear , became concentrated on the gravestone . It was crooked and looked as though it had stood long in damp shade ; in its cracks , small ferns and mosses had taken root . On its weatherworn face , only these letters could be read : illiam msdeu H. M. S. Mercury , i6t1a year of his pril 1831 loved . . Peace " Lumsden or Ramsden , I suppose , " said the Third Officer , patting the gravestone encouragingly , as though it were a human shoulder . " Or maybe some queer name we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamsden or Topand-bottornsden , " chanted Cutty . " Or Birnsden or Bumsden or ? " His mother shook him violently . " Shut up , you silly little fool . " She added in a suddenly pensive voice , " No , it could n't have been a queer name  --  not a funny name . . . It must have been a solid English , Kentish name . . . No railway station jokes about that name . " The Third Officer felt uncomfortable . " Best be getting on to the village , " he said and took a few steps in that direction , anxious to get this tiresome morning 's work finished . The village , a tottering huddle of crooked planks , was wedged between the pine woods and the beach five hundred yards away . Mary made no move . She stood and watched the gravestone as though she expected it to stir . " Well now , Mrs. Loo , what about trotting along ? " " I 'm tired , " said Mary . " And what 's the use of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We could say your husband 's name and see if it meant anything to the villagers  --  that is , if you know how it sounds in Chinese , " said the Third Officer . " I do n't say it would work , but it 's worth trying . " " I know how to say it in Chinese , " said Cutty . " My dad taught me . My dad said it like this  --  Liu Wahtak . " " Cutty 's a proper little son of his father , " said the young man , amused by the child 's pert parody of the Cantonese intonation . " Yes , he is that , " said Mary gloomily . She remained so passive after that , looking at the stone , that presently the Third Officer volunteered , " Well , what about Cutty and me going on to the village and just saying Mr. Loo 's Chinese name to the oldest inhabitant and seeing what happens ? We 'll come back here and tell you the news . " Mary Loo did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another minute Mary could hear a score of village dogs barking at them . She could see quite well that there was no one near her now  --  no one standing opposite to her , looking at her across the gravestone . She experienced no vision . And yet , quite clearly upon the shadowed air of her fancy was projected a ghost whose thin , senseless presence seemed like the visit of an angel . No , there was nothing there  --  no one there . Some trick of loneliness made this grave interesting to her , as though the smoke-gray stone were a beacon lighted for her eye alone on that submerged crumbling mound of English bones . English bones , lost in Chinese earth . A Chinese spider  --  bright blue with a big , bright belly  --  had woven a web from the stone to a near shrub ; the web was perfect  --  as perfect as flowers might be on a carefully tended grave at Kensal Rise . This heartless decoration was appropriate for forgotten bones . Mary found herself thinking conversationally about spiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she wished to convince in order to justify herself . " Spiders , " she argued wordlessly , " have a lot of sense . I canremember about spiders from my school-teaching days : spiders are amazons ; it 's the woman-spider that rules the roost among spiders ; it 's the husband that has to face being eaten up . Ca n't you imagine the mother spider  --  very domineering , very sure ( pa would have no say beyond what ma let him say ) , bringing up all her daughters to be little goddesses almighty , bringing up all her sons to sacrifice  --  sacrificesacrifice .. . . . ' Wait till Miss Right comes along , ' she tells ' em ? ' be modest , know nothing , do n't even know what job will be expected of you , just be prepared for sacrifice  --  that 's a boy-spider 's lot . ' And so the girls all go off and gobble up their friends , and the boys sit at home waiting for a female sheik to come and gobble ' em up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , have spiders .. . . " Before whom was she making this justification ? Was it a justification ? Was it a confession ? Of what ? She looked up . It was almost surprising to find nobody there , looking comfortingly at her across the grave . She looked about , as though a friend , restless with sympathy , might have moved away a few steps . Her straying eyes were caught by a light wisp of movement on the sand within a few feet of her  --  a crab digging itself a hole in the loose , dimpled sand that stretched from the grassy margin of soil to the sea . With anxious industry the crab sprang to the bottom of its hole , and in a minute came carefully out , grasping the largest load of sand its claws could encompass , and , after swinging delicately once or twice  --  rather as a golfer swings his club before making his stroke ? it recoiled tensely and hurled the gobbet of sand to its dump-heap several inches away . Then , without a pause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat the process . The sober frenzy with which any creature builds its home has none of the joy that brightens the other obsessive animal instincts . Hunger and sex excitement even in suspense have their raptures , but a creature wears itself out without immediate joy in making its house ; its busyness , in this one activity , is animated by a kind of despair . There was a touch of this desperate , unexpettant , home-making industriousness in Mary 's deliberate construction of her saving ghost in the air  --  a ghost with straw-colored hair and a red face . Seeking in her memory for the most English face possible , she fitted her ghost with the high , rather snub nose and the cheerful , sunken stone-gray eye of a grimy young mechanic once seen in a London bus . So portrayed , straddling across his Chinese grave , against this Chinese nothingness , the ghost of William Ramsden seemed perfect to her . Her eyes ran up and down their creation , adding a touch here and a touch there . She felt as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and yet this comfort had the suspect , dangerous quality of comfort clutched at in a dream . The Third Officer and Cutty came back . " It 's really no use , Mrs. Loo , I 'm afraid . Cutty said the name beautifully , and there was a very helpful old chap there who did his best ; but evidently that name meant nothing to him . Come along with us to Hongkong and make proper inquiries ? " " I found a little toad , " cried Cutty , showing the little creature leaning from his loosely clenched fist like a preacher leaning from a pulpit . " I 'm going to keep it forever . " " It wo n't live forever , silly . " " When it dies you 'll find a treasure inside its head , " said the Third Officer . " All toads have got one , they say . " " Yes , I know . it 's got a compass inside its head . Looky bore -- if I turn my whole self slowly round with the toadin my hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole  --  that 's because it 's got a compass inside its head . " The child seemed to Mary intensely irritating ; she knew his voice too well ; his complacent , adenoidal voice seemed to call her home from a delicious journey . She felt vaguely that she had been at home in the heart of a far-away friend ; she recoiled from the mean , too-familiar threshold of her own child 's heart . Intimates , she thought , should dwell in her heart  --  not she in theirs . May one then find joy only in exploring the hearts of strangers and ghosts ? Sore with a feeling of bereavement and parting , Mary Loo followed the Third Officer back to the cove , holding Cutty round his forearm with her usual ruthless and insulting grip . Pigs and hungry dogs from the village rooted among the dappled cowrie shells in the sand . The shells were so big and shiny that they looked as if they had been brought from the best-parlor mantelpieces of Clacton-on-Sea landladies , in a self-conscious attempt to add Tropical Local Color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the island , Mary saw , across a crooked wave , a little yellow plaster house , hedged from the cove by a thicket of oleanders . " Who fives there ? " she asked . " Nobody now , " said the officer . " It 's just a ruin among weeds , so to speak . In the old days . they say , a ship chandler lived there ; the cove is called after him  --  Chandler 's Creek . " " Somebody lives there still , " said Mary . " There 's somebody now  --  look ? not a Chinese  --  standing waving by the window under the tall tree . " The Third Officer put up the glasses that he carried slung across his shoulder . " There 's nobody there , really , Mrs. Loo I can see right through the ruin . That 's a bunch of tall grasses waving by the window . Must have been a trick of light made you think you saw somebody . " " A trick of light  --  a lick of trite ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wick of ? " " Shut your silly mouth , " cried his mother . " You 'll be sick of fright in a minute , jumping about like that  --  capsizing the boat . Do n't you know everybody 's got to sit still in a boat ? " " I know , " said Cutty . " Why , mammy , what you crying for ? " The Third Officer looked away in order to avoid being made uncomfortable by the sight of tears on the cheek of this charmless woman . The captain of the ship , however , when the party reappeared before him with the story of its futile mission , thought that Mrs. Loo would have eased the situation by crying a little . She was hard and indifferent , he thought ; it would have been much easier to be kind to a weeping woman . For the good man was full of a harassed craving to be kind to Mary Loo . He must force help on her . She needed help much more than she knew , it was clear . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plight to the sphere of conscience rather than that of heart . It was a matter of duty to help her ; she was n't one of those women who just have to waggle their eyelashes to engage the delighted chivalry of any man anywhere . In Hongkong , therefore , as soon as the business connected with the arrival of his ship was finished , he hurried irritably through the heat to the door of the boarding-house Balmoral , and asked for her . He found her and Cutty , looking bleakly transient , turning over the pages of out-of-date trade papers such as are always found in the frowzy sitting rooms of cheap hotels . " Well , Mrs. Loo -- any news ? " asked the kind man . " What about ? " " Well  --  about your husband , Have you traced him ? " " My husband is n't here ; I thought you knew that , Captain . He left long ago ; he wrote and told me long ago that it was no good my coming out to Hongkong because he was leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old Portuguese landlady . " " Well , well , " said the Captain drearily . " That must make it rather uncomfortable for you in this house , I 'm afraid . Can I help you to find nice rooms somewhere else ? " " Oh , I paid the bill , of course . I had to , in order to stay . This is the nicest house I could stay in . Nothing nicer would take me and Cutty , you know . " " Wiyever not ? " " Well , short of the big expensive hotels , the refined boarding houses do n't take Ch ? " " Oh , Mrs. Loo  --  do n't talk like that , " the Captain gasped . " So you felt you wanted to pay your husband 's bill . I hope that means ( excuse my mentioning it ) ? that you are n't badly placed for money . You 've got enough to pay your passage home if you ca n't find Mr. Loo  --  to get back to your own people .. . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate , to England . " " England 's not my home now . The English are not my people any more , they tell me  --  in spite of my blood . If a woman marries a foreigner , a foreigner she is  --  even if English earth and air and sea made her  --  and a foreigner she 's got to remain . Cutty and 1 are Chinese now ; we 're told to be at home in China  --  whether we feel so or not . There 's no home really for us now , among living people . " The Captain reflected . " There 's a government office here specially for helping ladies in trouble , they say  --  er ? Chinese ladies . And if what you say is correct  --  about being legally Chinese  --  they ought to do something for you , I 'm sure . Wo n't you come along there ? " " I 've been there already , " said Mary . " Cutty and I stood in a queue of Chinese ladies  --  very fancy ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office said he 'd make inquiries but he did n't think he could do much to help me . I said , ' Well , if I took up a disreputable life  --  then you could help me , could n't you ? ' He turned up his nose at that and said again that he 'd make inquiries about Walter . This morning he telephoned . He said , the less said about Walter the better . He said that Walter used to live here on women 's earnings and persuaded girls to come to Hongkong from China . He said that Waiter was banished ; then he was seen again here and got mixed up in a nasty case wounding a woman ? but he got away just as the police were after him  --  and now he 'd probably disappeared for good . I said maybe he 'd gone to Chinchang Island , but the young man said , ' Why on earth should he go there ? ' I told him how Walter had written me that he was going there to start a turtle farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you he was going to Chinchang , I 'm afraid that 's the last place you 'll find him , Mrs. Loo . ' " " Tck tck tck , " said the Captain , beating his furrowed brow . " And did n't the young man give you any advice how to ? " " He said , Chinchang Island 's the last place you 'll find him . The last place you 'll find him , ' he said . " The Captain looked at her in surprise . " Yes , Mrs. Loo , so you 've just told me . .. . Well , now , what about advice as to a legal separation ? I suppose that government young man would help you in some other way  --  pay your passage  --  advise you about ? " " He asked me if I 'd any money , and I said I 'd got fifty pounds a year of my own  --  that 's what Walter married me for , and he left me when I would n't make it over to him . So the youngman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him , yes . " " Oh , you 've got friends , have you ? " said the Captain , immensely relieved . " Why did n't you tell me that before ? Can I help you to get in touch with them ? Are they actually here in Hongkong ? " " I 've got friends on Chinchang Island . Thinchang Island , ' the young man said , ' Why , that 's the last place you 'll find Walter Loo , ' he said . " The Captain 's jaw fell . " Chinchang Island ! Why , Mrs. Loo , you 're joking . Chinchang Island 's that godforsaken place where you went ashore on Friday . There 's nobody on ? " " Oh , go away  --  go away ? " cried Mary . " I have got friends  --  I have got friends  --  I 've got much better friends than you . . . . " A wave of offended irritation bore the poor Captain out of the house . Yet even then his conscience would not let him forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home to try to reason with her . " She 's gone , " said the landlady . " Not coming back . Going to live with friends , she says . " The Captain stood in the street and looked out at the harbor  --  at the forward-tilted yellow sails of the junks moving crazily across the crowded distance . Well , he 'd done all he could , he thought ; after all , there 's really nothing to be done ; there 's no place anywhere for a woman who marries out of her race . But Mary Loo , sitting uncomfortably on an inner rib of the chopping , pitching junk that was carrying her invisibly away over the Captain 's horizon , saw the hem of the patched rattan sail rising to the lift of a wave  --  rising like a curtain on a pale stage  --  on a delicate painted scene  --  the far crest of an island . . . . The line of land was as frail as the rim of a sea-shell , a hope as brittle as only a pretense can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
