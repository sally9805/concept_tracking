On the Southern coast of Maine between Portland and Penobscot Bay , scores of tidal inlets snake from the sea between mud-flat peninsulas , crab-haunted and reedy . In these shallows live salt water worms by the billion , more worms than can be found in any similar region on the Atlantic Coast . For years Maine clamdiggers made a sideline of digging worms for bait , considered them chiefly a damnuisance because during the breeding season from April to June salt water blood-worms sting like bees . Then somebody discovered that when properly packed the worms would stay alive for two days , could be shipped to fishermen in other States . In the last five or six years Maine 's worm business has grown by leaps &; bounds until this summer it has a turnover of 2,500,000 worms a month . <P> Salt water worms are of two principal varieties , the smooth-sided bloodworm , which stings , and the fringed sandworm , which pinches . Average length is from six to eight inches , but full-grown sandworms are sometimes a foot long . As bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sandworm being especially alluring in spring and autumn , the blood worm in deep summer . Few years ago when salt water worms were rare , fishermen in Long Island Sound were willing to pay as much as 75 a dozen for them . Standard price in this year 's well-organized market is 35 per doz . <P> Around Boothbay harbor and Wiscasset last week wormdiggers were working night and day to meet the demand of an unusually good fishing season . At low tide the diggers wade around in knee-deep mud , combing wrigglers to the surface with long-tined clam rakes . A lucky day 's haul is 1,000 worms but the average is 500 or less , paid for by worm dealers at the rate of 75 per hundred . In night digging the men wear dazzling electric spot lights on their foreheads , and have a slightly greater advantage over the quarry , whose custom is to bask on the surface in the dark . While the tidal mudflats , owned by the Government , show no signs of worm depletion , vigilant Maine has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike oyster beds which require occasional reseeding , Maine 's worm muds seem inexhaustible . But Maine is taking no chances . <P> Leading Maine wormster is tall , shrill , husky Kenneth Ely Stoddard , 24 , who began digging worms five years ago when he was broke and could get no other job . Now he employs 44 diggers and one packer at Boothbay harbor , supplies nearly half the total market . Because mud is a worm 's fighting element , Stoddard worms are dropped in buckets of fresh salt water and kept swimming to prevent them from killing each other off before shipment . They are packed on layers of seaweed in small hampers , 100 worms to the hamper with five thrown in " to take care of the breakage . " Specially cooled freight cars take three tons of worms into Manhattan every week . Though all other Maine worm dealers quit from October to April , smart Kenneth Stoddard works the year round , hopes " some day to organize the whole business from here to wherever worms are found on the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
