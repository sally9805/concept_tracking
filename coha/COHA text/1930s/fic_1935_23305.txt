THE HOME PLACE : SUMMER A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS MO WAKE to the hardy hymn of hens 1 and the far and sweet lament of turtle doves , to see the sky so deep a blue beyond the little window gave Phyllis such happiness she wanted to sing . She laughed to herself when the song that came to her lips was one of her mother-in-law 's hymns , " On the other side of Jordan , In the green fields of Eden . . . " She put out a sleep-weak hand and laid it on the rounded blanket in the basket beside the bed . What a good baby to sleep so late ! Mama Young said he was the best baby she had ever seen and Old Granma said she had seen but two as good and both had been " taken under three . " Site raised herself on her elbow to look at him . He was lying with his fists up on either side of his head . He was " all Young " as Old Granma had said when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n thigh , " she had crowed , " this boy 's all Young . The girl 's yours , Phyllis , but this one 's a Young . " Phyllis had been sure from the first that his eyes were going to be like her father 's , but she had kept this to herself . " Hello , Son , " she whispered . " Happy birthday ! " The baby tucked down his chin , opened one eye , closed it again , and yawned . " Four weeks old , " Phyllis said . " Want a party ? Want to have on a dress and have a party ? " The hands moved in wider circles and the mouth puckered . Phyllis lifted him into the bed beside her . " He 's too lazy to eat , " she told her mother-in-law when Mama Young came upstairs to carry the baby down for her . Mama Young sat down on the bed beside her and patted the baby and crooned , " Was him Granma 's big boy , was him ? Why , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big boyl He 's got a whopper appetite . I believe he weighs more ' n any my boys did , at his age . Archie , the one we lost when he was still a baby , he was a heavy baby , but he was n't as solid-fleshed , seems to me , as this child . Arch would have liked it , I think , if we 'd named the next baby after him , too , but you know I could n't . A baby 's a person , no matter if you do n't have it but for five months . I remember all his ways , clearer , I think , than I remember any of them when they were babies , except Harvey . The baby , you know , the last one , without another one on the way to get ready for and take care of when it comes , gets so much more looking after and notice . And the other children , the older ones , they all keep saying , ' Look at baby ! ' Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the older two , of things Harvey did and said when he was a baby . That helps you to remember things , I think . They made so much over Harvey , the older boys , Tom especially . He 'd let that child tag him all over the place , or he 'd carry him on his shoulder . Pick him up and hold him way up above his head , and the little fellow ' d hold his knees stiff and spread out his arms and balance . He was such a strong little boy . Tom was so proud of him . Took more notice of him than he ever has of any one of his own boys really . He was the best brother . " Ralph , now . I honestly felt sorry for the child when I had Harvey while he was still such a baby . I remember when Harvey came Grandma said , ' No need for your nose to be outa joint , Son . You be my boy now . ' And really she took almost all the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her sooner ' n he 'd go to me , she took so much care of him . And he 's never forgot it . Ralph 's awfully fond of his grandmother . He never loses his patience with her , never . " I 'm glad yours is six years apart and did n't overlap so . Betty 's gone with her Dad and the boys to watch them put up hay . You do n't care , do you ? I said to Torn  --  jokin ' you know  --  I got him by himself and I said to Tom , I 'm makin ' cherry cobbler , and if Ralph 's young'n comes cryin ' from your boys pickin ' on her , not a bite do you get , and I mean it ! ' " " I 'm going down , " Phyllis said , " and stay down all day , doctor or no doctor . I think Edna 's laid up all these lazy days against me , and it will take all summer , no matter how hard I try , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to where they 're haying after I 've bathed the baby . " " Well , that would do you good , likely , " Mama Young agreed . " The boys got the cherries all picked now and Edna ' n ' I are going to pit them soon as we can get at it . But let me bathe the boy . I 'd like to . I want to weigh him . You go right on out to the field if you think it 's not too long a way . It 's so nice out . Just day afterday like this I can hardly believe it . I feel like they say Old Mrs. Morgan does  --  that we 've been forgiven or something . I wake up and it 's just a surprise to me to see it so green , after a whole year of it so dead gray . Seems like a miracle . Greenest June I ever saw . Let me take the baby on down ? you 're not to carry him . " Mama Young gathered the boy to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him all the way . Left alone , Phyllis dressed slowly , carefully , in her pink gingham . It was so nice to be putting on her " thin " dresses again . To tie the sash of pink gingham round her very slender waist seemed almost as great a miracle to her as the greenness of the land was to Mama Young . Ralph might not say anything , he might not even notice enough to know he noticed the pink gingham , but he would smile , without bothering to figure out how she was like her old self . Phyllis had learned in the eight years of her marriage to rejoice in Ralph 's noticings and in his splashes of wit when they came , and not to bait him for them . She had not quite learned , however , to let her own happiness in the things she made for their home be enough for her . She still felt angry , terribly angry , and hurt when Ralph failed to notice works that had cost her hours of effort and tiredness ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him for not noticing , not appreciating , she forgave him and made a last great effort to do something else , something especially for him , and found a deep and very superior satisfaction in her silent forgiveness . Sometimes he gave the needed irony to that satisfaction by saying , stretched long and shoeless in the easy chair she had sawed and built and cushioned for him , " My , Baby , we 've got it mighty cozy here , have n't we ? " The winter was really over and gone . Phyllis could almost forget it , the brittle cold , the dust and the dead ugliness that lay on the land , and the workings of hate in the house . Her boy 's coming had been so much worse than her girl 's coming . It was better not to think of that at all . " A fine boyl " the doctor had said foolishly , like a doctor in a woman 's magazine story , and when she had laughed with the mingled mirth at his saying just that and pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was still alive and could laugh , and somewhere , away and away , she had heard her father-in-law shouting to his old mother , " And it 's going to rain , Ma , it 's going to rainl " Her fine boy had come the morning of the day it rained . When she was dressed she put her room in order . The overalls Ralph had worn the day before lay over the back of the little rocker , chaff spilling from the turned-up hem . What had he said about their needing mending ? They looked such tired clothes , tired with such a farmer-tiredness . Something about them made her remember the early days of her marriage  --  those days and those nights when she was getting used to the tiredness of farmers . She wondered if all town girls who married farmers puzzled about that tiredness as she had puzzled over it . It was an honest , shoes-off and silent tiredness  --  that young farmers seemed to be able to lay aside almost entirely through the evenings of their courting days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and felt , at home with it . She had learned to read her poetry books to herself , to fall asleep over her own sewing at nine o'clock . Edna was alone in the kitchen when Phyllis came down . She grunted something that might have been " good morning " and went out the kitchen door with a nest of pans under her arm . " Cherries , " she said over hershoulder , and Phyllis knew that she meant that the pans were to be used in sorting and pitting the cherries , and that Edna was in one of her kindlier moods . Willa came out of Old Granma 's room with her hair standing out wildly around her pointed face . " Well , you up ? " she said when she saw Phyllis . " Thought the doctor said you were to go back to bed and stay there all this week too . " " I feel fine , " Phyllis said , " just fine . " Willa washed at the sink and sat down at the kitchen table with Phyllis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . " You 're lucky , " she said , " if you feel fine . I sure do n't . Could n't sleep . With the whole yard out there , what did they do but bring all that cherry stuff right round under my window . Mama and OM Granma and Edna out there . They got the baby out there too on a quilt . Mama 's going on to the baby and Old Gran-ma 's talking about her folks in Indiana , and nobody could sleep . " " I 'm going out and help , " Phyllis said . " I Love cherry time . " " Well , you can sure have mine , " Willa said . " They likely wo n't let you help anyway . Old Granmall start in about some woman that had a baby and then pitted cherries and the baby died of double convulsions . " Phyllis laughed . " I never heard of those , " she said , " but it sounds like her all right . " " Mama 'll likely run in to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby , " Phyllis said , still laughing . " Me ? Like heck I should ! Nobody 'd be madder ' n Harve if I did have one , nobody but me . He 's ga-ga about kids , yours anyway , but he would n't want me to have one . " She slid her chair closer to Phyllis 's , rested her elbow on the table and her chin in her palm , and said , " Harve 's up to something . I do n't know  --  but he 's up to something . He means to put something over on Willy  --  you wait , you wait and see . I 'm on to him . You wait . Two can play at his game . " " What game ? " Phyllis asked . " You wait , " Willa said , narrowing her usually extra-wide eyes to slits . Willa always talked to Phyllis when they were alone as though they were allied against the Young forces . She was always saying , " You wait , you just wait . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , poured herself another cup of coffee and brooded over it , her shoulders rounded , her mouth pouting . " Some day that guy 's going to get me mad enough I 'll tell him something , " she said . Willa saw herself as a woman of infinite forgiveness and self-control . Her coming to the farm at all she looked on as a piece of base trickery on Harvey 's part . That all the Youngs were " against " her , she was very sure . " Yes , I 'll let loose and tell him sometime , " she went on . " You know , when we got married ? . we 'd both lost our jobs , you know  --  well , I had another job . I could have gone to work the morning of the day we got married . He asked me to marry him  --  we were up at his place  --  and I said I would . I did n't tell him I had another job if I 'd take it . I did that for IIarve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here , to this . I did that for Mr. Harvey Young ! And sometime , when he gets me mad enough , I 'll tell him too . You wait ! " " Do n't do it , " Phyllis said . " Well , I wo n't unless he drives me to it , " Willa said , pink with the pleasure of thinking on the gracious twist she had given to the bringing about of her marriage to Harvey . She picked up a piece of cold toast and bit into it with her narrow teeth . " I was nuts about Harve , " she said , " and he was about me too before he started running with that Country Club bunch and going out to a big place where he used to go over Sunday where there was one of those front-page debs . Well  --  she let him down , and I took him back after that . Not every girl 'd do that . I thought I knew him like a book , and I did , but something sure bit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , do you think he 'd ever sit around and read and listen to classic music ? Well  --  you do n't know Harve from what he 's like now . He liked everything I did , and after we got married  --  well , honest , Phyllis , before we got outa the courthouse he begun to crab , and he 's done nothing but bawl me out ever since . He thinks he 's so smart  --  and it 's the God 's truth that guy ca n't even spell ! I had to work his letters over all the time in the office . I do n't kid myself . Harve 's about as mean and spoiled as a man can get . He got spoiled playing football , down at the State , and you know all the folks here spoil him . And he thinks his family 's so much better ' n mine , though he 's never seen mine . And except for you and Ralph , who around here 's so educated ? Ralph , he just had the two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he do n't need to feel so smart about it , Harve does n't . Good night ! I went to business college , did n't I ? I did n't go clear through  --  but I stepped into a good job . " Phyllis had been waiting for Willa to stop talking . " I 'm going outside , " she said while she was washing her breakfast plate and coffee cup . " I want to help with the cherries . " " You for it , " Willa said . She looked up almost suspiciously at Phyllis . It was plain she regretted her confidences . She got up and tossed her uncombed hair back from her face . " Oh , well , " she said bitterly , sadly , " you wait . You wait and see , " and went toward Old Granma 's room . Her breakfast dishes she left on the table for Edna to wash . Out in the sunshine the three women , Mama Young , Old Granma Young , and Edna , made a bright picture grouped round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded green gingham , Edna in blue percale , and Old Granma in her black sateen , white apron , and Paisley shawl . Mama Young sometimes tried to get Old Granma to fold her Paisley shawl away , declaring that it was far too good for everyday , but Old Granma always said , " No , I learned my lesson looking down into Old Mrs. Tickert 's casket . Look how she skimped and saved , and was just a living patch , and when they buried her , did she have her good shawl on ? No , she did n't . Those boys ' wives of hers , they thought it was too good . And if they 'd buried her in it , what comfort would it ' ye been ? No , I tell you , my Aunt Kate was right : ' Have the best first and have the best all the time . ' I 'll wear my good shawl . I do n't go out often and when I do I 'll wear it and get the good of it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good piece of cashmere . " Phyllis dropped down on the folded quilt beside her baby and reached for a handful of cherries . " That 's right , " Mama Young said , " eat all you want . They 'll never harm you . Some say they will , but they wo n't , not if you do n't drink milk the same meal they wo n't . I remember one of the Miller girls  --  they 're all gone now  --  had the prettiest color , and they say that 's what she did in cherry time . Drank a quart of cherry juice every day . They used to put it up , they say , put the cherries through the press and put up the juice , just for her to have to drink . My , she was a pretty girl ! You remember her , do n't you , Granma ? " " ' Deed I do , " Old Granma said , sucking loudly on a cherry , " and she was lazy as sin . All those Miller girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had one of them over once , and the river came up and she could n't get home for a week , and instead of helpin ' me , I had to pick up after her . She 'd stand and look in the mirror , primpin ' , with the men right in the room . Edith , her name was . " " Oh , no , Granma , " Mama Young said . " That was n't Edith . Edith was one of the older ones , and goodness knows she was n't lazy or silly about her looks either . That was Grace was the one that was at your house . " " You do n't know a thing about it , " Old Granma said sharply , and drew her shawl closer about her elbows . " That was before you were born . This girl , this Grace , was a little thing , something like this woman George brought home , only dark instead of fair , and she was lazy as sin . " Mama Young began to hum a hymn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair morning to take the time to remind her mother-in-law that she was not her " born " child , that Willa was Harvey 's wife , not long-lost George 's , and that she had herself just owned that the Miller girl they had been discussing was Grace and not Edith . " The best ones , " Edna explained , " go in this pan , for pickles . The pitted ones , here . " Phyllis felt reproved for eating instead of pitting , and after she had kissed her baby 's wrist , straightened up and began to work rapidly . " I 'm glad there 'll be so much for pickles , " she said . " I think your cherry pickles are the best I ever ate . " " They are good , " Mania Young said , " but they 're not mine , that is , the receipt is n't . No , those are Jenny 's mother 's pickles , and she made up the receipt herself . " " Jenny ? " Phyllis said . " Now she 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed getting acquainted with the Young relatives through hearsay . " Well , yes , " Mama Young said , " she 's a cousin in a way , for she 's married to one of Arch 's brother Jim 's boys , but she 's no blood relation . But Jenny 's mother  --  her name was Jenny too  --  she was dearer to me than I could think a sister would be , though I never had a sister . They came out here about the third year Arch and I were married , I think , shortly after Granma moved in with us , and we just took to each other from the start , Jenny and I. Oh , she was the best woman ! " " Who you talkin ' about ? " Old Granma said , hitching her chair closer to Mama Young 's . " You mean Jenny Blight ? Well , I do n't know how you can say it , Mamie . I never liked her . I never could abide a woman that would n't stay home and tend to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good half the time . " " Oh , no , she was n't , Granma , " Mama Young said . She shook the pan on her lap , to settle the pitted cherries and then held the pan out to Edna and dropped her hands either side of her , with the juice dripping from her fingers and said , to Phyllis , " Sometimes , I 'd give anything to see that old white mare and that buggy come over the hill , up there by the cottonwood . I miss Jenny so . " " I never think of her , " Old Granma said , with decision , and put her hands behind her to grasp the back of the rocker to help herself up . " I 'm going in , " she said . " I 'm going in and lie down awhile . " Edna went with Granma . " Time to get the potatoes peeled , " she said . Alone with her mother-in-law and her baby , Phyllis stretched out on the quilt and lay with her hands clasped under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama Young said , and laughed silently , quiveringly . " She never liked Jenny  --  that 's Jenny 's mother I 'm speaking of now . You see , I was n't but seventeen when Arch and I were married , and we lived in a little frame house that they tore down when they built-over the cow barn , and then when Jim got married  --  that 's a funny thing for Jim  --  he named his boy after himself , his first boy , and Jenny , this friend of mine , she named her girl after herself , and they grew up and were married . We used to call them Big Jenny and Little Jenny , but Jenny was n't a big woman . She was little . Little Jenny 's a lot like her , but she 'd never have the get-up and go Jenny had . You see , we were planning the house , this house here , and Granma , her mind was all made up , and she 'd tell Arch just how she wanted things built . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , yes or no . ' Arch  --  you know how he is yet . He thinks everything 's all right , just go along , thinking everything 's smooth , and Granma 'd run him . She run all her boys . He never dreamed but I was perfectly satisfied . And , Phyllis , I could n't even wring out a dish rag but Granma would take it outa my hand and tell me how they wrung their dish rags in Indiana ! " Well , Jenny came out here with Mr. Blight , and she was from Connecticut , and first time she was over here , Granma started in on Indiana and she started in on Connecticut , and it was just a show , and so noticeable even Arch noticed . We got out the plans we 'd drawn up for the house , or that Granma 'd drawn up rather , with Arch saying , ' Well , just whatever you and Mamie want , Ma , ' and Jenny could see I 'd not had a word , and she lit in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamie ? ' and I thought Granma was going to put ' em out , I had to ask ' em to stay for supper myself . She would n't . " Why , I was such a goose , wanting so much to please Arch . And if Jenny 'd never come out here , she 'd be runnin ' me yet , Granma would . Jenny showed me the way . ' Sing a hymn , ' she said to me , ' and go your own way , Mamie , ' and I 've done it . Jenny was a great one to be fixing round her house . If she wanted anything she took the odds and ends on hand and she made it . You put me in mind of her , Phyllis , in that . The day you fixed over the ell room for you and Ralph and Betty , I said to Arch , ' Now , that 's Jenny for you , all over ! ' I know you ca n't tell a young girl just starting up housekeeping anything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell her ? what Jenny told me : ' Sing a hymn , and go your own way : A man 's good for some things , but for knowing what a woman 's about when she 's making something  --  well , you know . What comfort are they ? There ai n't one in a hundred 'll come in and say , ' Ai n't that nice  --  and what a lot of work ! ' Not unless he 's been prompted a lot or is kind of old granny anyway . No , it 's a neighbor you got to look to for that . There 's nothing like a good neighbor . And there never was one fuller of appreciation than Jenny was . " Her girl 's been on my mind a lot lately , since those floods started out west . Jim and Little Jenny live out near McCook , you know , out there where it 's bad . I knew when Arch subscribed to the paper again , after we 'd done without it for so long , that there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those floods , and his brother 's boy out there in ' em . But their names have n't been listed , and I guess if they 'd been washed out and were alive they 'd let us know . I guess they must be all right . " " Have they ever been back here ? " Phyllis asked . " Oh , yes , they 've been here a number of times , before and since my Jenny died , on their way to the Fair . Jenny 's got two of the huskiest little girls . " Here Mama Young stopped to laugh , her silent , bosom-shaking laugh . " I wish you could have seen , " she said . " Jenny 's oldest girl 's just the age of Edna 's first boy , you know . Well , when they were here last  --  Tom and Edna were still in their own house then  --  we had them all over here for supper . The children went out to play and Tommy tried to take something Jenny 's girl had , and he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd taken him down and trounced him good  --  bloodied his nose . They 're sturdy little things , and they 're a little like their grandma . They know their own mind . " " I was going to the hayfield , " Phyllis said . " Do you think it 's too near din-nertime ? " " Why , I do n't know , " Mama Young said . " I 'd guess it is n't more'n eleven . Better feed your boy first and then , if you do n't think it 's too warm , you go . Wear my hat . " Phyllis took the baby into the house to nurse him . Edna was setting the table . Old Granma was sleeping on her bed in the kitchen corner , snoring her trembling , feeble snores . Awake , she seemed very much alive , but always when she slept Phyllis was reminded of the old woman 's age and fragility . There were pauses between snores that seemed alarmingly long at times . " Guess they 'll think they got the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her she was going to the hayfield . " Your girl and my kids out there now . The boys are helping of course . " The anger Edna 's words could . bring up in her , rose in Phyllis . Did Edna think that Betty had no business out at the hayfield even when her father took her there , that the child would be in the way ? The baby squirmed in her arms . In the corner Old Granma turned on her back and snored a louder , whistling snore . Phyllis was reminded of the old woman 's warning that anger would " bitter " her milk . When Phyllis started toward the stair door with her baby , Edna said , " Where you goin ' ? You wait . I 'll carry the basket down . You 'd rather have him be downstairs , would n't you ? " Kindness from Edna always touched Phyllis . Kindness came so hard to Edna . " Why do n't you go out with me , " Phyllis asked , " out to the hayfield ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't been out there since the year I was married . " She laughed her breathy laugh . " Used to work in the field all the time ' fore I was married . Would yet only Tom 's mother 's got notions about it . Thinks it looks funny ! Anyway , somebody 's got to get the dinner . No  --  I 'll stay here . " When she had put the baby in his basket Phyllis took her mother-in-law 's wide straw hat and went out , and through the barnyard to the hayroad . She stopped by the garden fence to look at the rows of peas and beans , the lettuce , and the melon plants . The garden was clear of weeds and fine looking . Phyllis swung her hat from her fingertips and wondered who it was that kept the garden . Edna , she supposed . Yes , she was sure that many times when the little boys had asked for their mother , Mama Young had said , " Why , she 's up at the garden , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the washings and ironings , looked after her chickens , and managed , without talking about it , to keep a garden . The hayroad left its years-old ruts to curve round a stagnant , muddy pool . A black-and-white cow came to the fence and stretched out her neck and breathed loudly toward Phyllis . Her childhood horror of cows came on herso that she wanted to run . " Sook Boss , Sook Boss ! " she said , put out her hand , then drew it back from the wet slobbery tongue , and was glad no Young , even Ralph , was near to see her . The hayfield was beyond the " near " wheat field . There was a gentle , cool wind on the fields that made ripples over the grain . Beyond the wheat she saw the stacks on the alfalfa field , and the slowly rising stacker . She heard the men shouting to their horses . Ralph 's loud , " Get over there , Kit , you ! " surprised her , amused her just as it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he ever been " cross " with her , ever raised his voice in anger . She always started a little when he yelled at the stock . The wheat came to her breast . She felt suddenly free of it , as though she had been wanting to run , when the hayroad led into the open alfalfa field . Harvey saw her first  --  he was on the stack  --  and waved to her . Ralph was driving his sweep , an extra large load of hay before his team . She stopped near the stack and watched him come un . Kit and Beaut stopped just where they should , then backed expertly , and the stacker rose slowly and slid its burden of hay onto the stack . The timbers of the buck were red , and its teeth bone white against the very blue sky . There was something fine about the stacker 's going up , emptying and then going more slowly down . Little Betty came running to her mother , rubbed her hot cheek against Phyllis 's wrist , and cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look ! Look what Daddy found . A pheasant egg ! She had a nest and they spoiled it , but they did n't mean to . Daddy says she 'll make another one . The other eggs are in Tommy 's hat . " " No , they ai n't , " Tommy said , puffing from running to get to Phyllis before his brothers could reach her ; " we threw ' em . " " Oh , no ! " cried Betty . " Sure we did , " Tommy gloated . " Busted ' em . Threw ' em at a post . " Betty began to cry . " I was going to take ' em home , " she sobbed . " I was going to put ' em under a hen . " " We 'll put this one under , " Phyllis said . " Do n't cry . Shall I hold it for your You 've held it , kept it warm , have n't you ? " Betty ran away to look for other pheasant nests that she confided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , and the boys went to follow their father 's mower . Phyllis sat down on a heap of cut alfalfa and rested , her arms wound about her knees . Watching , it was easy for her to understand how Edna had been happy , helping in the haying . The thought of doing the work herself tired her , but to imagine Edna doing it , stacking , up on the stack , or driving the sweep , filled her with a vicarious happiness . Ralph came to her at once when the men stopped work . " My , you look slick as a banana peel , Baby , " he said , giving the lie to her pre-breakfast thoughts about his reactions to the pink dress and her regained slimness . He dropped into the stubble beside her . " How do you feel ? " he asked . " This the day Doc said you could be up ? " " Your mother said I could , " Phyllis said . " I feel fine . " Harvey came over to them , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he grinned . " You do n't look like a farm girl . Tell you what you look like  --  like the lead in a bucolic operetta . " He drew down his mouth , wrinkling his brows and said in his brother Tom 's serious , vexed voice , " Come on , let 's get going ! " " You can ride in the cart , " Ralph said , pointing . toward the decrepit rig that pulled the buck . " You and Betty . " " No , no she 's not to , " Harvey said . " She 's to ride Old Tilly . And I 'll ride Prince . Come on . " " Why , I could never get up on her , " Phyllis said , more than half afraid . " I ? " Tom had driven his team near . At his grave , " Hello , Phyllis . Come on , boys , let 's get going , " Harvey laughed , picked Phyllis up and swung her onto Old Tilly 's back . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got on Prince . " You 'll look after Betty , " Phyllis called back to Ralph , not at all sure he was pleased at his brother 's high-handedness . Ralph grinned after them , a grin that was an answer to Harvey 's . Harvey was the favored one . Whatever he did was in the eyes of Ralph , and Tom , and Grandpa Young right enough and endearing . " I abducted you like this so I could talk to you , " Harvey said . " Got something to tell you . " Phyllis remembered her talk with Willa that morning , and waited , clinging to the harness that made a very insecure side-saddle , and anxious about riding . It would make her unforgivably ridiculous to fall off a work horse , at a " dead walk . " " I think I 'm getting out , " Harvey said . " I ought a know any day . I think I got a job ! " His voice grew husky with the import of his news , with the hope of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I go , " he said . In his embarrassment he gave old Prince a crack with the rein , and both horses trotted a few paces . Phyllis grasped the harness more tightly and did not try to speak until the horses were walking again . " Oh  --  fine ! " she gasped . " Fine ! Tell me about it ! " " Well , a fellow I was in school with wrote me . Says he 's got a job down in New Mexico , a good one , a soil erosion job , and in the place where he is they need an accountant , and he put my name in , wrote me , and I got the application blank , and filled it out and sent it in , and  --  he thinks I got a good chance of getting it . If I do-1 go down there  --  and the men live in bar-racks . " " What  --  what about Willa ? " Phyllis asked . " Well , send her money , but I ca n't take her down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking , not at Phyllis , but away over the fields , with such satisfaction in his face that Phyllis could not help but feel some pity for Willa . " I thought you and Willa were getting on a lot better , that you were happier , " she said . " You mean , by any chance , that look she gets in her eye when I do something she 's thought up to see if she can make me do ? " Harvey asked . " Nope , after that night Dad bawled us out , I made up my mind  --  two things : first , I was getting out , just as soon as I could , and second , I was n't going to give the folks any more of Willa 's shows than I could help . " " I think she 's very lonesome , " Phyllis said , surprised at herself , little as she found to like about Willa , to be seeming to champion her . " Who is n't ? " Harvey asked . " It 's her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 'd tried at all , but she has n't . I 'm like Dad . I do n't like scrapping . The only way for Willa to be happy is to be on the go all the time and be scrapping in between . We have n't the time or the money for that . Aw , Phyllis , you know there 's no sense in me tryin ' to get on with a girl like Willa ! I 've tried it a whole winter  --  and that 's too long . I thought if I could n't have Doris it did n't make any difference who I had . But that , even , would n't have been what I wanted . I could n't ever talk to Doris . She 'd make you feel all the time that things were all right for right now , but you'dbetter look out , in a minute you 'd likely do something to make her walk off and never come hack . I guess she was just spoiled . " He smiled suddenly , that broad smile that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " and I could n't tell her a thing . No , I 'm going to get loose , and then I 'm going to look for a girl like you , Phyllis . " She turned and looked at him again , her lips parted , her eyes wide with surprise at the earnestness in his voice . " Do n't you do it , Harvey , " she said , her words tumbling over one another . " I 'm spoiled too , rotten spoiled , as Old Granma says . I 'm an awful baby . I ca n't garden and I 'm scared of cows , scared sick ! " Harvey looked down at her , and they laughed together , loudly , happily . There was the rattle of cart wheels behind them , and Ralph and little Betty turned out around them , into the edge of the field . Tom and his boys came up behind them too . Then there was the garden and beyond that the barnyard , and next , Ralph was putting up his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing too much , Baby . You ought to take it easy . " The spicy smell of pickle syrup drowned out the odor of fried potatoes and ham . Ralph went to admire his young son , where he lay in his basket at the foot of Old Granma 's bed , and Grandpa picked up his paper , even before he looked over his few pieces of mail , to see what there was about the floods . There was a letter by Harvey 's plate . The boy picked it up and went out onto the step with it , and did not come in even when Tom called him . Grandpa asked the blessing without either Harvey or Willa at the table , and then opened his letters with his table knife . " Letter from Jim , here , Mama , " he said to Mama Young . " Let 's see what he says . " " Well , I 'm glad , " Mama Young said , " awful glad . I 've had Jenny on my mind and heart so all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was anything ? " " Well , well , Mama , listen to this , " Grandpa said , " listen to this , Mama  --  they been clear washed out ! " Instead of reading the letter aloud , he handed it over to his wife . " Jim has ? " Old Granma cried . She was always confusing her son Jim with her grandson Jim . " Well , I told him not to go out there . The Republican 's a tricky river . Any river 's tricky , and the farther off one I live , the better I like it ; but I 'm sorry for Jim , I am . But Jim 's gone , is n't he ? I thought we buried Jim , Arch . Did n't we lay Jim away ? " She was almost crying , lost between reality and things she " musta dreamed . " Harvey came in from the steps . At just that minute , as though she had heard him walking about and thought he would be coming for her , Willa came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slid a generous slice of ham onto his plate , and then sat looking at them , his large hands resting , tremblingly , either side his plate . " Dad , " he said , " I got a job . " " Oh dear , " Mama Young said , with such a mingling of meaning . She was happy of course that Harvey had a job , but a job would take their baby away from them , and they had loved having him home , even for such a bad and crowded winter , even with Willa . " Ya ? " Willa said through her pointed teeth . " What ? " " Well , that 's good , Son , " Grandpa Young said , " but we 'll be sorry to have you go if you have to leave . " Grandpa Young spoke with ease and love and hospitality , as a man who had plenty of money and a big house might speak . Phyllis , looking at him , saw him through tears , and loved him almost asmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Willa shrilled . " What 's your job ? " Harvey looked at her . Was the moment of his telling his family about his job to be spoiled by a woman who had somehow come to plague his days , a woman who screeched at him ? He half rose in his chair . " Will you shut up ? " he said . " Will you shut your mouth just a minute ? " Mama Young gasped . It was the first time since the night before Phyllis 's boy was born , the night Grandpa had told the boys " where to head in , " the night before it had rained , that Harvey had told Willa to shut up . " What 's the matter with you ? " Tom asked . " She did n't do anything . She just asked you what you 're going to do . What 's wrong with that ? Whata you have to take her head off for ? " The letter , Harvey 's letter , lay in front of his plate . He had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to him . " Now , you keep out of this , " he said with forced calmness . " Willa 's my wife , not yours . I 'll be glad to tell her what I 'm going to do if she 'll shut up and let me . " His voice was not only angry but hurt . He was the baby , and what he did was important and interesting in the eyes of his family . He had wanted a job so long , and now a near-miracle , a pure happenstance , had brought him one , and his wife and his brother were spoiling it for him . Mama Young gave a bosomy mother-moan , and held Nephew Jim 's letter up in her hands . She had looked down at the letter in her embarrassment when Harvey and Tom were quarrelling , and the line she saw was : " And all Jenny 's mother 's things gone , dishes and all . " " Listen , children ! " she said . " Jim and Jenny 's homeless , clear homeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running over . " What 'll we do , Arch , we 'll have to send for ' em , wo n't we ? " " Where d' you think you 'd put ' em ? " Edna said . " Looks to me .. . " " They can have Granma 's room , " Harvey said . " I 'm packin ' right now . " " Oh , Son , HI have to do some mending for you , " Mama Young said , " and I think you 'll just have to buy you some socks . Yours are just riddled . " Harvey handed his letter , the letter that gave him a job and his hope of freedom , across to his father , and his eyes asked forgiveness for losing his temper at the table . The old man adjusted his glasses , coughed , and whistled , and then read slowly . Phyllis 's baby cried , and she went to him . In the excitement about the two letters no one noticed when she lifted him and carried him upstairs herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay down beside him . " Happy birthday , happy birthday , " she said to him . Did everybody but his Mama forget it was his birthday ? He went to sleep again at once , and she lay brushing his wisp of hair with a finger tip . In the tipped dresser mirror she could see herself , very slender in her pink dress . She might be some young girl , holding somebody else 's baby . She put her hand to her face and brushed back the curls . It seemed to her that she had not looked so young since the spring Ralph had given her his ring . There was a sleepy , noonday mingling of birds in the yard trees . Over head , against the rafters , a wasp buzzed and blundered . How good it was that the spring , and as much of summer as they had , had been so pleasantly cool . Only two nights had the raftered room been too hot for sleeping . Ralph had slept even then . Now she heard Ralph coming up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it was Harvey instead of Ralph , coming up to tell her about his new job . In the mirror she sawthe color creep over her throat . Was n't she a goose though to be so flattered that Harvey thought he wanted a girl like her when he picked another ? Poor boy , she was sorry for him , sorry for Willa too , sorry for the Jim Youngs , who were washed out , sorry to tears . She wiped the tears away with the ruffle of her baby 's dress and smiled up at Ralph when he came in . He sat down on the bed beside her . " Well , " he said , looking at the sleeping baby , " Whata you think of that stack ? Pretty nice stack , was n't it ? " " Fine , " Phyllis said , looking at him through wet lashes . He glanced about the room . " You know , I think we could cut a couple of dormer windows in here , " he said . " If they 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some more windows in . " " Who ? " Phyllis asked . " Who 's going to sleep up here ? " " Why , Jim and Jenny , and their girls , I guess . " " Well , I guess not ! Where are we going to sleep ? If you think I 'll move back down to Old Granma 's room  --  Ralph , I wo n't . I .. . " Ralph leaned over and brought his face close to hers . There was a strong smell of alfalfa , sweat , and horses about him . " Will you shut your mouth ? " he growled , in a voice that was much like Harvey 's voice for Willa , and laid his cheek against hers . " If you were n't such a little pig , I 'd have had a surprise for you , " he said , " and now I suppose I 'll have to tell you . " " Ralph , " she whispered , " You 're not going  --  you have n't got a job down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , we got a house . " He sat up again to look at her , to see what she thought about their having a house . " Where ? " she breathed . THE HOME PI , " Over other side of Don Ferguson 's . It 's two rooms , Baby . Their renter-house , and they 're not going to have renters any more . I 'm fetchin ' it over just as soon as we get through haying . See ? " " Oh my , " Phyllis said happily , ready to cry again . " Ralph , you 're  --  how are you going to pay for it ? " " With the sweat of my brow , and Dad 's and Tom 's . Harvey gets off , since he 's leaving to-night . We 're going to work it out over there . It 's just two roams . You must n't expect much . " " I 'll love it , " Phyllis said . " Has it any closets ? " " I never noticed , Baby . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , or hang-ing . " He leaned and kissed her , and Phyllis , busy with the happiness of feeling so well , and slim , so proud of her baby , so in love with Ralph , had mind enough left , with her arms tight about Ralph 's neck , to remember the bundle of wallpaper in the storeroom behind the quilt curtains . There must be two dozen rolls . Would there be rolls enough alike to paper one of the rooms ? Most likely not . But with even three rolls alike she could panel the rooms . She could distribute the other patterns , the gayer patterns , in panels . She could .. . Tom was calling Ralph at the stair door . He kissed her again and looked at her with that awed , enraptured ed look , as he had looked at her the morning her son was born , as though God had held her back from another world for him . She got to her feet and went to the door with him , and hugged him as hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to tell him that her other world was a wallpaper one . As soon as the lower stair door closed on him , she went into the storeroom and found the bundle of wallpaper and untied the binding twine that heldit . There her mother-in-law found her , with the wallpaper in scrolls around her . " Oh dear , oh dear , " the old lady said , sat down on a trunk , and smoothed her apron over her knees with her plump hands . " I 've got so much to do I do n't know where to begin . I got to mend Harvey 's shirts and underclothes , and the boy 's plain destitute of socks . He 's going on the night train too . This friend of his sent him a check . Was n't that mighty fine ? " " And what about Willa ? " " Oh , " Mama Young looked down on the wallpaper patterns as though she 'd quite forgotten Willa . " You know how old that piece is ? " she asked . " Arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring we lost the baby . Did n't say a word , just brought the paper home . Awfully pretty pattern , is n't it ? And it did comfort me , somehow it did . " Phyllis waited . " Why , she acted up , " Mama Young said . " Willa did , awful . And I 'm glad she did . Yes , I am . She went all to pieces . Such talk You wonder how anybody ever brought a young'n up to act so . I was glad , for Tom 's sake . You know  --  you know how he 's been . Tom 's tenderhearted . People work on his sympathy . They can , you know . And I think he 'd just never really seen Willa clear , and when she talked to Harve like she did , well  --  he just looked at her , Tom did , and pretty soon he got up and went outside while she was still abusing Harve . Went down toward the barn , and I could tell just by the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how fond of Harve Tom is . I do n't think he 'll let his sympathies run away with him over such a person again . " Mama Young smoothed her apron under her pink fingers while she talked . " What will she do ? " Phyllis asked . " I do n't know . He 's in his room , getting ready for me to help him pack now , and Willa 's in there , talking to him . He 's not got money to give her to get away , so I guess she 'll have to stay on here until he can send her money to go on . I do n't know what she 'll do . Nobody 's more against separation than I am , Phyllis , but  --  I do n't know . " " Will she stay on in Granma 's loom ? " " No . No , she wo n't . There 's no sense in it . To-morrow morning I 'm going to clean the room -- Edna ' 1l take care of the cherries  --  get Old Granma back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep in the kitchen . " A smile was twitching the corners of Mama Young 's mouth . Now Phyllis slid toward the older woman , laid her head back on her knees , and they laughed together , laughed at the thought of Edna coming down to get breakfast in a room where Willa slept . " I was talking with the boys , " Mama Young said , " and they think , this stuff up here , we can store away in the mow , and this end the room we 'll use for the little girls , Jenny 's little girls . No tellin ' how long they 'll be with us , but until late fall , I expect . " " And what about me ? " Phyllis asked . " You 're a bad one ! " Mama Young said . " Do n't you think anybody ' d know to look at you Ralph had told you about that house ? Where you going to set it ? " " Oh , up under the cottonwoods , where I went the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And haul water all that way ? You ca n't do that , child . It 'll have to be nearer the well . " " Down near the apple trees then . " " That would be all right . We 'll see , we 'll see . Ralph 'll likely have some notions about it , and Arch . " Mama Young began to hum to herself , and Phyllis wondered if she might not have a notion too about the placing of the little house . " Have you seen it ? Has it any closets ? " she asked . " Child , it 's bare as a bone , " Mama Young said . " It has n't a closet or a shelf or anything . It has n't even a step . " I must get downstairs . Edna 'll have all the dishes done and set away , and she has enough to do with the cherries on her hands . Betty 's asleep in Old Granma 's bed , with that egg in her fist . I guess she run herself tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come down and help with the cherries , " Phyllis said , " as soon as I get this paper rolled up again . " " Arch is writing Jim to-night , " Mama Young said . " They 're with some friends of theirs out there . " Phyllis looked up at Mama Young , shaking her head slowly , wonderingly , at her cheerful acceptance of the idea of having four new people in the house . " You 'll like Jenny , " Mama Young said . " And be like one of our own boys . Jenny is such a hand with the canning . And Betty 'll like the little girls . " She stopped on her way toward the door , to lean over the bed and say , " He 's such a good baby . Granma 's Lamb ! "
