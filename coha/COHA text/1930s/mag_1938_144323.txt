Nobody knows how Bug Tussle , Ala. got its name . Its 300 citizens , mostly cotton farmers , rather think it refers to their annual battle with boll weevils . <P> There is no post office in Bug Tussle and nobody in Bug Tussle has a telephone . Almost everybody is almost everybody else 's cousin . The citizens of Bug Tussle present a united front to the world . Two months ago two postal inspectors from Birmingham arrived to ask a few questions . It took rather longer than they thought , for nobody was at all cooperative . But last week they finally arrested seven people for using the mails to defraud . <P> According to officials of a Northern mail-order house-which one the inspectors would not say-Bug Tussle had done them out of $6,000 worth of overalls and kitchen stoves . The citizens had done it , they said , simply by giving themselves as references for each other and nobody ever seemed to have paid for what he ordered . One of them even got his cat an A credit rating . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrests , but they think it fortunate for their case that they will be able to take the erring citizens out of Bug Tussle for trial .
