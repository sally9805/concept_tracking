It is not yet definitely determined whether June net operating income together with other income will suffice fully to cover fixed charges for the month . In June , 1932 , net loss after charges was $1,183.620 . Expectations still are that earnings for the period from June 1 to December 31 this year will be sufficient to cover fixed charges of something over $10,000,000 for that period .

Movement of old grain held back from the good crop of last year continues to be a major factor in the improved traffic . Small grains in North Western 's territory have been materially damaged this year by hot weather and other factors , but the fact that as much as possible of the 1932 crop was held back last year should aid comparisons in the later months of this year when the new crop is moving . Good Corn Yield Likely On the other hand , the corn crop in 90% of North Western 's territory is stated to be in good condition , with prospects for a large yield if frost stays off . Ore traffic , which is not shown in the reported loading figures , is picking up and estimates now are that North Western 's ore movement in 1933 will reach about 4,000,000 tons ( about half the normal movement ) as against less than 500,000 tons in 1932 .
