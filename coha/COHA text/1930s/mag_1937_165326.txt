At long last , on the 80th day of siege , last week Bilbao , the city that has scorned capture for 700 years and the motto of whose red , white and green flag was INVINCIBLE , fell . At the end hardly a shot was fired . But every bridge across the Nervin River had been blown up as was the great Guecho arms factory , one of the prime prizes in Franco 's drive on Bilbao . As was expected , Anarchists ran berserk for a few hours before the city was abandoned , murdered many a suspected Rightist sympathizer . As the Rightists moved in a few faces scowled from the sidewalks , but for the most part Bilbana housewives who stayed in the town greeted the invaders with shrill enthusiasm . For week after week they had lived largely on constant gunfire and bombing . For a while at least there would be an end to fighting . <P> Loudly the Italian press hailed the occupation of Bilbao , second seaport and seventh city in Spain , as a great Italian victory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bilbao itself Rightist General Jos Fidel Davila , knowing the growing unpopularity of all foreign troops with Spaniards of either side , was careful to keep the Black Arrow Italian division well in the background . It was the red berets of the Carlist Royalist militia that first appeared in the streets , patrolled the city . <P> Not one word last week came from youthful President Jos Antonio de Aguirre y Lecube of the Basque Republic who had fled with his Government . For all he was worth Generalissimo Franco pushed on to Santander knowing that every day 's delay would help Santander rally its defenses . Cracked soon it had to be if Spain is to be conquered and Madrid captured this summer . Leftist Madrid has talked of taking a general offensive ever since the Negrin Government came into power in Valencia . Lack of material and properly trained men has always been the Leftists ' greatest handicap . But time is on the side of the Loyalists , Generalissimo Franco knows , and if he wins his war he must win it soon .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
