txt In his address to the people outlining the subjects which he intends to lay before the special session of the Legislature Governor LEHMAN appears in something like the familiar American role of the advance agent , pasting his posters on the hoardings . This is the kind of show he proposes to put on : he hopes that his " brief recital of the subjects to be submitted " will " per " mit the people of the State to observe " and follow the session with interest " and understanding . " It is peculiarly the Governor 's show , since at an extraordinary session the Legislature may act only on the agenda which he submits to it . In this instance they will include , at least at the outset , only a limited number of topics : reorganization of county government , relief for the holders of guaranteed mortgage certificates , State aid for education , eradication of bovine tuberculosis , reapportionment . While he may have other suggestions to offer later , he is determined , he says , to confine the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some might argue that reapportionment hardly falls in that category . Since it is already many years overdue , why not postpone so vexed an issue a few months longer ? The sufficient answer is that the existing apportionment , legislative as well as Congressional , is a shocking denial of the fundamental right to equal representation . Since the last redistricting some political divisions have grown in population , while others have shrunk , with the result that the man who still lives on Cherry Street , for example , may have nearly ten times the voting power of the fellow who moved out to Jamaica . In Brooklyn almost as great a gulf may divide two families who live on opposite sides of the same street . It is surprising that such palpable misrepre- sentation has not given rise to wider protest against the rival political organizations which have allowed it to persist . Now while the Legislature is under divided control is the time for a reasonable compromise . While county reform , along the lines recommended by Governor LEHMAN and ex-Governor SMITH , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a peculiarly perplex , ing issue to decide in the matter of State aid for education . Not that the subject itself presents unusual complexities ; on the contrary , it is less encumbered by technical considerations than most questions of State policy . It resolves itself , as the Governor says , simply " into the weighing of " the relative benefits to be derived " from the increased appropriations " which will be required if the old " schedules are restored as compared " to the burdens that come through " additional taxation . " The difficult task is to do this weighing fairly and intelligently . While well aware of the needs of the schools , the Governor makes no specific recommendation at this time beyond the suggestion that the two existing laws  --  one calling for State aid to the tune of $115,000,000 and the other , in accordance with his earlier recommendations , making appropriation for only $102,000,000 ? be in some way reconciled . He does , however , note one new element in the financial situation which must give the legislators pause  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next fiscal year , instead of the balanced budget he had forecast .
