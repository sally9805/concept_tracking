W ITH THE OVERTHROW of the Laval Cabinet apparenfly only a matter of days , France faces a political crisis for which no ready solution is evident . Confronted by clear-cut left majorities in both houses of Parliament , Laval may be defeated on any one of three vital issues . As was anticipated , the economy decrees promulgated last summer have aroused bitter hostility on the part of Socialists and other left groups . On the other hand , the continued flight from the franc indicates that the deflationary measures thus far adopted have not been sufficient to remove the basic financial maladjustments . Devaluation may still be necessary , though it is a step that no government is anxious to sponsor . Even more threatening at the moment is the question of the government 's attitude toward Colonel Casimir de la Rocque 's fascist Croix de Feu . After a recent battle in the streets in which members of the Croix de Feu attacked and injured more than a score of police and anti-fascists without themselves suffering any harm , Colonel de la Rocque demanded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionaries " of the other parties . The left , in turn , has demanded the complete suppression of the fascist organization , an action which might provoke violence . A third issue is that of sanctions against Italy . Here again there is a sharp division of opinion , with the right demanding greater leniency in the treatment of Italy , and the left acutely dissatisfied with Laval 's weak-kneed support of the League . Under ordinary circumstances one would expect Laval to be followed by a left government which would reflect the present sentiment of the country as a whole . But in view of the complexity of the situation , ex-Premier Herriot has served warning that he will not take office , while M. Blum could not command a stable majority in the Chamber . The only alternative is the unsatisfactory one of seeking a new leader who will continue the present compromise arrangement  --  a task which is becoming increasingly difficult as the months pass without a solution of basic problems . SANCTIONS have now been in force against Italy for , - , nearly two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory than was deemed possible even a month ago . Reservations and exceptions by the League countries have been few and relatively unimportant , while Germany 's embargo on essential raw materials , including tin , nickel , manganese , aluminum , zinc , iron , antimony , rubber , leather , wool , and hides , has proved an unexpected aid to the League powers . Nevertheless , it has been increasingly recognized that full effectiveness of the economic penalties can not be obtained until the League adds petroleum , coal , and steel to the list of embargoed commodities . The products now barred from Italy , while important , are not immediately indispensable . Without oil , gasoline , and coal , on the other hand , Mussolini 's war machine would be paralyzed . Ships , motor trucks , tanks , and aeroplanes are worthless without fuel , and Italy 's present supply would not last more than from three to six months . An increasingly large share of the amount now being imported is coming from the United States . The fact that France and England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embargo these products does not relieve this country of responsibility for aiding Mussolini in his illegal invasion of Ethiopia . Both from the practical standpoint of keeping out of war and the moral one of avoiding assistance to an aggressor , it is imperative that we find some way of taking independent action to bar war supplies from Italy . Each day that we postpone this step strengthens the interests that would eventually draw us into the maelstrom . T HE OCTOBER TRADE REPORT shows the futility of moral suasion as a means of curbing those interests which would drag the United States into war . Despite repeated warnings from President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull against trading with belligerents , American exports to Italy in October  --  the first full month since the beginning of hostilities  --  were more than 10 per cent above the corresponding month last year . For the same month our exports to Italian Africa , previously very small , rose more than 700 per cent , and for the first ten months of 1935 were no less than 1,300 per cent higher than in 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mussolini for war purposes . Exports of iron and steel scrap to Italy were valued at $454,000 in October , 1935 , as compared with $179,000 in October , 1934 . Shipments of oil to Italy and Italian Africa totaled $1,185,000 this year as against $337,000 in the same month last year , an increase of over 200 per cent . Refined copper exports rose from $188,000 in October , 1934 , to $534,000 in the corresponding month of 1935 . A similar increase occurred in the sale of automobiles , tractors , and trucks , a large proportion of which went directly to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland . Although several of the smaller oil companies have indicated their willingness to abide by Secretary Ickes 's request that all shipments to Italy be discontinued , the larger concerns , particularly the Standard Oil group , have asserted that they will not suspend trading unless compelled to by the government . Meanwhile the Administration , loath to take action under the " implements-of-war " clause in the neutrality act , has gone as far as it can within the limits it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper , trucks , tractors , and scrap steel as " war materials , " and indicated that cotton might soon be added to the list . Action has been taken to keep American ships from carrying supplies to Italy , and to prevent the sale of government-owned ships to Italy for scrap . None of these steps , however , is sufficiently drastic to stop unscrupulous American business interests from enriching themselves out of the war , or to prevent them from undermining the League in its attempt to substitute law for anarchy . F ROM THE OUTSET the Roosevelt Administration has made it clear that it was utterly indifferent to the naval conference called by Great Britain to meet in London early in December . We were not prepared , however , for the deliberate slap given to it by the President 's appointment of Norman H. Davis , Rear Admiral W. H. Standley , chief of the bureau of naval operations , and Under Secretary of State William Phillips , as the American delegation . Not only is there no Cabinet officer on this list , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a genuine advocate of radical disarmament . With all respect to Mr. Davis 's excellent intentions and arduous labors in previous conferences , he has been from the beginning in favor of our building up our fleet so that we might have in our hands a " good part of the pack " with which to sit into this game of international poker . The trouble is that all the other players are similarly eager to make as large a naval showing as possible , with the result that the Davis theory of having a big fleet with which to negotiate has not only hamstrung recent conferences but burdened the United States with the largest and most costly navy we have ever maintained . A S IF TO EMPHASIZE still further how little the Administration is concerned with taking the lead in London , it is announced that Mr. Phillips will stay only a short time and then return to Washington . But that is by no means the worst . The President 's appointment of Rear Admiral Standley verges on the scandalous , for this officer has just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small navy . Speaking to the Military Order of the Loyal Legion he declared : Our every effort toward preparedness is actively opposed by certain influences , claimed to be patriotic and some of which are known to be otherwise , whose common aim has been to weaken the national defense by opposing the naval building program . . . . Unfortunately , they are still with us and constitute the greatest menace to the stability of our government and to our national security . . . . There is no doubt but that this sinister propaganda is tending to undermine Americanism and to jeopardize our national security . The next day he repeated this address before the New York Chamber of Commerce , asking of it " active opposition to subversive influences tending to destroy the national defense . " ? In other words Admiral Standley possesses the worst kind of reactionary naval mind and is obviously the last man who should have been selected to fight for disarmament in London . Plainly he will be just as lukewarm as one of his fellow-admirals who , on his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying that he was glad his mission had failed ! Why Mr. Roosevelt did not appoint someone who is an ardent champion of disarmament and who really wants to see us lead in this cause , we can only explain on the ground that the President himself is not in favor of disarmament at this time . . - F4 D WA R D F. HUTTON , chairman of the board of directors of the General Foods Corporation , is much disturbed by the interpretation placed upon an article which he wrote for the house organ of the public-utilities corporations in which he called upon the great business interests of the country to " gang up " and overwhelm all opposition to their policies and plans . He now says that he would have withdrawn it , if he had not been ill , because of the President 's new attitude toward business . He explains also that the phrase " gang up " was made in a perfectly harmless sense . It was a boyhood phrase , reminiscent only of the old swimming hole and free from any suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains that he called upon the " business men of the country , the owners of stocks and bonds or any other property , the holders of insurance policies , and the depositors in banks " to get together " in one great group which will come to the help of any individual group when it is attacked . " The incident can not be passed over , for Mr. Hutton expressed in print the thought that is in the minds of innumerable corporation leaders and beneficiaries of special privilege . They say they do not want class war , but they are most eager for that great union of the right which Mr. Hutton , in his moment of passion , called for . If such a union should come about , with - the almost unlimited sums which it could control , we should be face to face with a business fascism reaching out not only for all political power but for the complete smashing of the labor unions . Mr. Hutton 's article , however much he may regret its appearance , is a useful warning . T HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demilitarized zone is slight compensation to Japan for the setback in its plan for an " independent " state embracing the entire- area north of the Yellow River . Of the many factors which may have contributed to the fiasco , the unity of the Chinese war lords and the unpredicted shift in British policy are the most significant . Within the past fortnight China has witnessed the unprecedented spectacle of all its important military leaders gathered at Nanking in a spirit of amity . That fact alone , since it was wholly unexpected by the Japanese , could easily explain Japan 's sudden timidity about seizing three of the most important of China 's historic eighteen provinces . Chinese resistance appears to have been materially strengthened by direct or tacit offers of British support . The rumor that Great Britain has arranged a loan to Nanking may have been premature , but there can be little doubt that the recent silver move was made on the advice of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross , British financial expert . The added fact that information regarding the pending British loan to the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was poised for a blow at North China is also significant . With the naval conference about to open in London and with the British playing a leading role at Geneva in the application of sanctions against an aggressor state , Japan has two excellent reasons for not wishing to incur British hostility at this time . For the Japanese military , however , these considerations will seem trivial as compared with the loss of face resulting from the failure of Japan 's widely advertised coup in North China to come off on schedule . As a consequence , there is danger that , as in 1931 , the counsel of the home government will be disregarded by ambitious militarists on the spot , a possibility which carries with it grave international complications . O NCE MORE the United States is being inundated with gold from Europe . Within the past ten weeks approximately $600,000,000 worth of gold has been imported into this country and deposited in the vaults of the Federal Reserve banks . There was a period not so many years ago when such an influx of the precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . At that time it would automatically have become the basis for monetary and credit expansion which would have stimulated economic activity throughout the country . Today each new cargo of gold from abroad is the cause of acute embarrassment to our banking authorities . Already we have gold reserves of nearly ten billion dollars , or 45 per cent of the world 's total supply . As a result we have three billions in excess bank reserves lying idle in our vaults , enough to support a credit expansion of approximately thirty billion dollars . The banking authorities are faced with a dilemma which is far more serious than that of 1927 and 1928 . To allow the golden tide to continue will not only play havoc with the few remaining gold currencies and postpone indefinitely any hope of international stabilization , but will lay the basis for inflation in this country . Yet the tide can not be checked without a fun-. damental change in tariff policy , which is politically unthinkable . Our policy of demanding gold and silver in exchange for our " normal " export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of available monetary metal becomes exhausted , we shall have to face the full implications of our insane commercial policies . The longer we delay the adjustment to an import surplus , the more difficult that adjustment will be . And , meanwhile , what are we to do with our tremendous idle reserves ? Put the unemployed to work paving our streets with gold ? W HAT IS THE MEANING of the verb " to teach " ? This simple question , apparently not susceptible of dictionary resolution , is agitating the District of Columbia at the moment . A rider to the District appropriation bill passed by the last Congress provided that salaries were not to be paid to teachers who " taught or advocated communism . " The Board of Education has acted on the assumption that " teach " and " advocate " mean the same thing , and that ateacher may present his pupils with information about communism if he is careful to refrain from championing any such subversive doctrine . This interpretation has been upheld by E. Barrett Prettyman , corporation counsel for the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. , and the Hearst press have advanced the theory that the rider prohibits the dissemination of any information , however factual , on the subject of communism . The difficulties in which such an interpretation would involve a teacher are obvious , ranging all the way from an inability to discuss in a classroom one of the most important issues before the country today to a more specific inability to describe the form of government under which one of the largest nations of the earth , with a population of 170,000,000 people , is now living . Compared with this device for befuddling the young , the old fiction that babies were brought by the stork seems positively scientific . And our patriots should be warned that American children were too clever for the stork story ; they will Find Out about communism ! They will ask their parents why these matters are not discussed in school . Or if they are less frank , they will learn their communism in the street ? that is to say , they will learn , not that communism is inferior to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them , but that it looks like a lot of fun for everybody . O NE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT cases recently considered by the regional labor boards was the action brought against the Freihofer Baking Company , the largest bakery in Philadelphia , by its employees . The company is specifically accused of organizing a company union through the use of labor spies , thus violating an agreement with the Bakery Drivers ' Union . How the company union was set up was described by John B. Backhus , president of the union , which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor . Backhus told the board that two company-union " specialists , " Irving C. Franklin and Donald N. Stoner , arrived in Philadelphia from Jersey City , opened offices , and advertised for " college men to do investigating work . " A friend of the union answered the advertisement and was one of four men hired . He recognized Franklin and Stoner as two men who had been ordered out of town by police last year when A. F. of L. officials discovered they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " investigator " learned , they had been operating in the New York area and had formed company unions for chain groceries , meat-packing plants , shoe companies , and movie firms , most of them in Jersey City . The four " investigators " were given stenciled lists of Freihofer employees and were ordered to ingratiate themselves with the workers and find out what they thought about having " a union of their own  --  one the company would work with . " On the basis of the reports turned in , carefully picked employees were taken in taxicabs to meetings at which the company union was organized . Six separate units were set up that night , one for each of the company 's branches in Philadelphia , Camden , and Chester . Dues were set at twenty-five cents a month , in contrast with the two-dollar dues of the bona fide union . It is reported that the Philadelphia regional labor board is determined to make this case , which has aroused national interest although it has been ignored by the Philadelphia press , the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
