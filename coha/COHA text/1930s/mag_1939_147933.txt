Mass production of U-boats for Ger many was described last week in Berlin 's authoritative Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung , with the implication that production would soon be one per day . " Every shipyard in Germany suitable for submarine building has been pressed into service , " said the article . " Furthermore , only the hulls are constructed in yards , while all internal equipment , superstructure , armaments and the like are built in the interior of the country . The time required for construction , from keel-laying to commissioning , is therefore extremely short . . . . A sufficient number of reserve crews has already been trained so that there are no difficulties on the delivery of the new vessels . " <P> Day of this article 's publication , Winston Churchill arose in the House of Commons to give his fourth war review as First Lord of the Admiralty . With his usual dry punch he declared : " The destruction of U-boats is proceeding normally . . . between two and four a week . . . . <P> " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as 400 U-boats in commission and that they are producing these vessels by a chain-belt system , I wonder if they are producing the U-boat captains and crews by a similar method . If so , it seems likely that our rate of destruction might well undergo a similar expansion . " <P> Mr. Churchill revealed that 1,000 British merchantmen have been armed to shoot in self-defense at U-boats , that " before long " 2,000 will be so armed . He pointed out that torpedo attack from beneath the surface " can only be delivered at a quarter of the speed that is possible to U-boats on the surface . " Not all naval experts would agree . But of convoyed ships declared the First Lord , " less than one in 750 has been sunk . " <P> Convoys can go no faster than their slowest members . Mr. Churchill said that the system has now been speeded by instituting " slow " and " fast " convoys , so that wallowing tramps do not hold up the parade. * He pointed out that while losses of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September , and again in November to two-thirds of October , neutrals last month lost four times what they lost in September . This , he said , " is indeed a strange kind of warfare for the German Navy to engage in . When driven off the shipping of their declared enemy , they console themselves by running amuck among the shipping of neutral nations . This fact should encourage neutrals to charter their ships to Great Britain for the duration of the war , when they can be sure of making larger profits than they ever made in peace , and have complete guarantee against loss . " He said Britain 's total tonnage loss for three months was 340,000 , offset by 280,000 tons transferred from other flags ( exclusive of charters ) , captured or built new . Net loss : 60,000 tons out of a grand total of 21,000,000 tons . For every 1,000 British tons sunk , 110,000 tons reached British ports and nearly 140,000 tons went out , a ratio of 250-to-1.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
