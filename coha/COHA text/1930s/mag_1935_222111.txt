Near-candidates , like near-beer , seldom satisfy the public . Wrinkles , furrows , creases and downright ruts have carved their way across William Edgar Borah 's face as , during the past generation , his perpetual near-candidacy for President got him nowhere . Last week with the recklessness of 70 years he decided to change his tactics , to step out , not as a full strength beverage , but as a sort of 3.2% candidate . Surely after so many near-attempts , he was entitled to have one final fling at intoxicating the public . <P> Down to Washington traveled a Republican delegation from Wisconsin to ask the septuagenarian from Idaho whether they might have the privilege of entering his name in Wisconsin 's Presidential primary . Solemnly he bowed in acquiescence . When the Wisconsin politicians babbled to the Press , the Press rushed back to Senator Borah for confirmation . Said he : " I am going to do what I can to get liberal delegations from as many States as possible . If the liberal forces wish to put my name at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they want to put the name of some other liberal at the head of the ticket that will be all right with me . " <P> Lest these words should not prove sufficiently arresting for statesmanship , the Senator prepared a formal statement for public consumption : <P> " My primary objective is a convention of liberal delegates which will write a liberal platform and name a liberal candidate . To that end I shall devote my efforts . If in any State or district the liberal forces think it will help the liberal cause to pledge the delegates to me , I shall cooperate fully with that plan . <P> " If , however , it is thought better to pledge the delegates to some other liberal , I shall cooperate just as fully . In other words , inflexible as to the objective , flexible as to the tactics . <P> " As I see the political situation in this country , a man would be seeking political immolation to take a nomination upon any other than a liberal platform . So the first thing to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
