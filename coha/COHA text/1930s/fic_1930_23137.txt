DJOMBE RIVER A STORY IN TWO PARTS  --  PART I BY JOHN W. VANDERCOOK T OTTON sat on the porch , his back against a post , his legs sprawled easily down the steps . The afternoon was drowsily warm . He watched a black-and-golden butterfly settling and darting above the grass , and considered lazily . Should he call Aloki to get his bath ready or should he first stroll down the hill and have a look at the vine bridge ? With a comfortable sigh he got up , stretched and , with hands in pockets , wandered down the path . Bryce had been away nearly a month and might arrive at any time . Just to be sure , he 'd look at the bridge once more . After the still gloom of the forest the glare was blinding above the open river . Shading his eyes with his hand , he peered up into the branches , examining the vine fastenings . All was secure . He climbed to the bridge and walked halfway across . Midway he stopped and leaned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swirl of the bright running water gave him a sense of relaxation . He half closed his eyes . It had been a long wait  --  thirty years of the tropics , Bolivia , Siam , the Gaboon . Dreary , lonely enough it had always been to look forward to , but  --  he breathed deeply of the hot , fragrant air ? not bad at all to look hack on . Be just like the thanklessness of humans if next year in Paris or New York or Vienna or wherever he was , he 'd have a twinge of homesickness . He chuckled . He 'd take a chance on that . . . Wonder how the concession would get on withouthim ? He half opened his eyes and cast them appraisingly on the nearby trunks . First thing to do when Gene 's girl showed up was to give her a few lessons in the lumber business . Heaven help the company with fat little Gene as foreman . He had wondered several times during the past month whether his offer had not been impetuous . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable . Possibly a wife would brace him . Something should . He stood erect and listened attentively . Voices . Talk of the devil ! With long steps that set the bridge springing he crossed to the far side and walked a few quick paces along the trail . The caravan rounded a turn , and he halted abruptly . Marion was ahead . Her white dress , always inappropriate and fragile , was caked about the hem with mud and streaked with dirt and grass stains . Her stockings were torn , muddy ; her dark hair appeared in confused masses from beneath her wilted helmet . She stopped at sight of him , and her dark blue eyes found his . The expression in them sent a sudden lump into his throat and made him sick with surmise . Timorous , weary , tear-dimmed , they yet held level . Her mouth trembled . " Mr. Totton ? " Jeff nodded . " Gene was drowned when we crossed the river two days ago . A . . . a floating log struck the bridge and carried it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what else to do . " She hesitated . " I will go away soon . I . . . I 'm sorry . " When he found his voice it came with a brusque loudness which startled him . The muscles of his eyes and jaws seemed to drag from the force of the pity that welled in him . His ragged helmet still rested ridiculously on the back of his head . He had forgotten to take it off . " Oh , good Lord , do n't talk about that . " He took both her hands impulsively . " My poor , poor child ! " In that touch an instant sympathy passed between them . His workman 's brown hands enclosed hers completely , A wave of relief swept over her . It was almost as if she had come home . His lean bronzed face , his kind gray eyes .. . after the fearful days of no one , it was comforting to find he was like this . He signalled that the carriers were to continue and stood aside with her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the hammock bridge and disappeared . " Gene told me , " she said in a Iow voice , " that the last bridge did n't count . " She walked forward resolutely , then stopped , shuddering , and covered her face with her hands . Jeff understood . With perfect naturalness he picked her up in his arms . She clung to him . Midway of the bridge he paused to balance himself . " Do n't be afraid , ma'am , " he said . She shook her head . He held her tighter to him and kept on . He explained the arrangements of the bungalow in a commonplace , slightly hurried tone  --  the verandah , the big rough-boarded living room to the left of the entrance door and the two bedrooms , his own and Gene 's , to the right . " We do n't , " he indicated , " run the partitions all the way up to the roof . Gets a better circulation of air the way it is . You wo n't find it much to look at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boast of the fine newbungalow he had planned to build for them , thought better of it , and stopped . He silently helped her to arrange her boxes in Gene 's room and sent Aloki and the cook to heat water for a bath . In a few minutes he left her at her door . She gave him her hand and looked at him . " I ca n't ever begin to tell you how grateful I am , Mr. Totton , " she said . He cleared his throat . " Anything at all I can do .. . I guess I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . " Totton walked down the yard . At the hedge he tore off a red hibiscus flower and crushed it tremblingly between his fingers . His mind was in a turmoil . Ile strove to think of the initial tragedy ? of Gene , of his planless days so violently and so senselessly ended . But try as he would he could not dwell on that . The tragedy of death seemed incidental , ended utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He mouthed soundless , reverent profanities . With a vague , clumsy gesture he wiped the sweat from his forehead . The blood pounded in his temples . A vision of her crossed his mind , of the pale drawn face against his coarse shirt , the relaxed young body in his arms as he carried her over Djombe River bridge . Why , she was a beauty . He kicked through a clump of grass and gazed with fierce detachment at the gathering clouds in the sunset sky . " Yes , now what ? " he asked half aloud . He shook his head seriously , helplessly , decided on postponement . With a physical shock he observed his ragged trousers . Jeff , ill-at-ease in a white suit that had mysteriously shrunken during several years ' retirement , stood waiting at the edge of the porch . He heard light steps behind him , but in an access of acute embarrassment did not turn . Marion , not realizing he was aware of her , studied him for a moment . Totton was a type of man she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breadth of his shoulders , the easy poise of his long body gave him a look of calm and purpose . He seemed effortlessly to dominate the silence , the whispering desolation all about them . She stepped beside him . " This is an awfully nice bungalow , " she offered . He smiled down at her . " It has a roof and four walls and it keeps the weather out . You can say that much for it . " She shook her head . " No , really .. . " She looked out over the rolling meadow-land of dark tree tops under them . " This is the most beautiful country , you know , that I have ever seen . " He looked at her wonderingly . " It makes me feel , " she went on softly , " that I have come back to the beginning . It seems . . . I do n't know just what to say . It seems as if it were waiting . . . **25;37;TOOLONG was over , the beauty would end . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jeff echoed . " It 's a great place for waiting , all right . I 've been doing that as long as I can remember . " He examined her admiringly . Except for a look of weariness about the corners of her mouth and eyes , there was little trace of the bedraggled waif of the afternoon . She wore a sleeveless white-linen dress . She stood erect , courageous , young . Her lips were slightly parted , tasting the sunset air . " I 'd like to say , ma'am , " said Totton earnestly , " that I certainly do admire your nerve . You show more courage than I should if I 'd been through what you have . " He hesitated , fumbled uneasily with his unfamiliar necktie and looked away from her . " I 'll tell you why I mentioned it . It crossed my mind that maybe you were keeping your end up on account of me , that you and I not being acquainted very well , maybe put you on your good behavior . Because do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly conscious , lowered it again . " I knew Gene pretty well , you know . So I mean to say if youwant to talk about him ... or anything .. . go ahead . " She shook her head . " No , it is n't that . But thank you anyway . You are awfully kind . " He shifted impatiently . " No use saying that . " Aloki , behind them , announced dinner . In a sort of hushed casualness they talked of food , of the difficulties of a jungle garden , of the aggravation of all cooks , of the obvious excellence of Aloki , of a boy Totton had bad in Bolivia and lost from an overturned canoe on a tributary of the Rio Madre . ( The inappropriateness of this tale upset and silenced him . ) But for the most part they said nothing . Marion 's thoughts seemed turned in upon herself . Her fingers ran incessant , nervous little courses among the things in front of her . Her manner , it seemed to Jeff , was thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future occupied her to the exclusion of the past . He was content to look at her . There was no harm in that , he argued . A man would have to be blind or senile not to . He worried whether she was really as exquisite , her skin as smooth , her eyes so deeply blue , her mouth as tender as they seemed to him . Aloki cleared away the things , made a bundle of the wrinkled cotton tablecloth , and ducked out under the hanging net for the last time . The silence that followed his going was oppressive . Except for the occasional faint angry rattle of termites in a mud nest. , somewhere in the roof thatch , the eternal roar of distant Djombe falls , and the sawing of cicadas in the outer dark , the quiet was absolute . They listened to the night . Marion 's elbows were on the table and her cheeks leaned upon her palms . She glanced thankfully toward Totton . The line of his jaw , the seams in his sun-darkened face , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mood of the woods was so intangible , amorphous . " Mr. Totton , " she said at last in a low voice ; " If you do n't mind I 'd like to talk to you . I owe you an ex-planation . " " You do n't oweme anything , ma'am . " She shook her head . " Yes , I do . I mean an explanation of myself . " She hesitated , then went on steadily , her eyes on the table . She had torn a splinter from the rough board top and drew tiny shapes with it . " You must think I 'm a queer sort of widow . I must seem terribly hard . About Gene . Not to seem more sorry . " She considered . " Of course I am sorry . It was a fearful , a ghastly thing . " Her mouth puckered but quickly became firm again . " But it was a way out . He did n't want me , Mr. Totton . " Jeff made a clucking sound in his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only being sorry for me . I did n't of course realize or I should never have come . " She looked up pleadingly . " You ca n't realize how tired I am of people being sorry for me . " Her eyes filled suddenly with tears and she brushed them peevishly away . " Really ! You see , my mother died when I was a baby so I was ' poor child ' to everyone for as long as I remember . Then when my father became ill I took care of him . So I was ' poor Marion ' then . . . . I ca n't tell you how kind everyone has been to me , how they 've pitied me , or how I 've wished they would n't . I suppose you think that 's childish and ungrateful ? " " No-o . " " It is , but I ca n't help it . When Gene came back from college I thought it was n't the same . Honestly , I do n't think it was . At least I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he got over it out here , and I was so foolish I did n't realize that of course he would . I 'm sure , though , he pitied me ! I knew it was that and only that the minute I got off the boat . But I was too cowardly to let myself know it . I simply . .. I simply did n't know what else to do . " Jeff cleared his throat . " I should n't be too sure of that . You ca n't know . . " Yes , I can . " She nodded vehemently . " Of course I can . He did n't want me . Not for anything . He never even touched me , Mr. Totton , do you see ? No man can know how bitter that is for a woman . How it destroys all one 's childish vanity . I felt so horribly lost . Do you understand ? You see , I wanted him or someone so much . To look forward to life for a long , long time . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a place for me at last . . . . Oh , I was so hopeful ! " She steadied her voice and looked at him . " You are awfully good to listen to me go on like this , Mr. Totton . " " Why , no indeed . I do n't see why we ca n't he friends . " " Thank you . " Her glance wavered , left his face , roamed desperately . The night wind shifted , rustled like approaching ghostly voices through the trees . It brought the sound of Djombe River nearer . She listened , and her face drooped forward on her arms . " I do n't know why the dickens , though , it could n't have taken me instead ! " The muscles of his throat were tight and his lips dry . So long , so long to have been away from all important , human things ! He felt strangely , in that instant , younger than she . He leaned across the table and tried to touch her hair . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if he must reach quickly back across the empty years . His fingers fell just short , and he rose and came around the table to her . He cupped her shoulders in his hands and steadied her . A kind of strength flowed up to him . With an effort he controlled his breathing . He said nothing for a long moment , then bent down . " We 've got plenty of time ahead of us , you know , " he said . " You 've had a long day . Why do n't you turn in now and we 'll . . . we 'll see about things to-morrow ? What do you say ? " Her head nodded , and he half lifted her to her feet and turned her to him . Her face fell back and she staggered a little . He put his arm about her waist to steady her , Suddenly he strained her to him and kissed her mouth . Her lips seemed lightly to answer his . He stepped back , his face hot with confusion . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to pass under . They walked the length of the porch and turned in the door . At the entrance of her room , dimly visible in the light of a smoking lantern that hung from the ceiling , he spoke again , by an immense effort of will keeping his voice under control . He moved and spoke like an automaton . " Good night . I guess Aloki has fixed your lamp and everything . If you want anything just say so . I 'll be right in here . Good night . " " Good night . " An hour later Jeff lay staring wide awake at the feebly lighted roof . His lamp and hers in the next room had been left partly on , and the vague rays mingled above the partition . It had begun to rain outside , a booming , lashing , tropic rain that made the house creak and faintly stir , seem doubly isolated in the black and streaming vastness of the woods . But the thatch was sound and the smoky lamps burned steadily . He turned twitchingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . The bed in which she slept , the big reed bed he had built in the past month as a surprise for the bride and groom , stood immediately next his with only the wall between . He could hear her . She was sobbing , hopeless , buried sobs that tore him like whips . " Poor child , poor child , " his lips formed over and over again . How beautiful she was ! He tensed out his long legs strongly and pressed his calloused palms hard down upon his eyelids . The scent of her breath , the touch of her moist mouth , the pulse of her body against his consumed him like fire . And he pitied her . His eyes felt dry with aching sorrow for her . The two emotions seemed to touch and intermingle . " My God .. . my God , " he whispered . A wistful cry , muffled and made almost inaudible by her pillow , came through the wall . With overwhelming resolve he swung his feet to the floor , found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his own door and walked shakily to hers . With hand lifted to knock he hesitated . He was trembling violently . What was he going to say , do ? In a moment he nodded decisively and tapped . The sounds abruptly ceased . At last a voice answered . " Yes ? " " Can I come in for a minute ? " Again a pause and again a " yes . " He turned the knob and entered . She sat diagonally on her bed , her bare shoulders propped against the wall . Her hair , shadowy and ill-defined in the half-light , hung about her shoulders . Her lips were parted and her eyes wide . He paused irresolutely halfway in the room . " I beg your pardon , coming in like this . But I could n't sleep , hearing you . . . . I guessed maybe you were worrying about what was going to happen ? What you were going to do , I mean . And I thought of something . I thought of it before , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to mention it . " He came to the edge of the bed , sat upon it , and took her hand uncertainly in his . " I thought of something , " he repeated heavily , " and I wanted . . . I had to know what you 'd think . " She gave him no help and he continued . " I wanted to say that if you did n't want to , you did n't have to go away from here . That was it . Just feel it 's your place as much as mine . You have a right to it , you know , because of Gene . . . and everything . Do n't be in a hurry , that 's all I mean . " His grip tightened on her hand and he lowered his face ashamedly . " Do n't say ' thank you . ' " His voice thickened pleadingly . " Good God ! you ca n't realize what it would mean to me if you 'd stay awhile . You do n't know how damned lonesome it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . . . maybe I should n't say this . So soon after Gene . . " he broke off . That somehow did not matter . Even the ghost of him was gone . All things had burned away but the sense of the waste years , their loneliness , and his desire . Her mouth grew curiously gentle , but a long minute passed before she spoke . " You mean you want me to ? For my own sake ? " She put out her other hand and covered his . " Yes . . . yes . For mine . " The lashing rain outside seemed to force them together . It was as if they were lost . She tried to move nearer him , came up kneeling . Her mouth was dose to his . " You 're not just being kind ? Sure ? Sure ? " " No . . Lord , no . " She put her arms about his neck . " If you 're really sure . " She relaxed against him and his mouth found hers . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His hand , trembling , moved along her back . " I am so glad , " she whispered . At midnight the rain ceased as quickly as it had come and a chill wind renewed the sound of Djombe Falls . Once she moved uneasily and , still sleeping , his arm went over her . He awoke from long habit and listened the next instant to the distant blast upon Aloki 's horn . She did not stir . Her head , the dark hair disarrayed about it , lay pillowed on her arms . She slept serenely , curled up like a child . Cautiously , so as not to wake her , he leaned and kissed her side . Quietly he rose and went to his own DOOM . An hour after daybreak she came to the verandah where he sat waiting on the steps . They pressed each other'shands and exchanged shy good mornings . Aloki brought the long-delayed breakfast , his brown , blank face a mask of restrained but perfect comprehension . " This food is n't much good , " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? You might try your hand at a garden . I 've got a drawerful of seeds inside if they have n't all sprouted . " " Grand . " They smiled at each other . Jeff cleared his throat self-consciously . " I 've got another idea . " " What ? " " Want to get married ? " " If you do . " He leaned across the table and took her hands . " I sure do . That is . that is . Do you ? It seems a poor sort of bargain for you  --  a dead old timber-trimmer like me . But it might be better , seeing . . . well , you understand . " " I told you last night , " she said earnestly . " If you want me . I .. . I 'm looking for a job . " " I 'm no boy , you know . " " Oh , there 's lots of time ahead . In a way we 're both just beginning , are n't we ? " He got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary fellow about sixty miles to the northeast . We could make it in three days , easy . But I guess you 're pretty tired ? " " Not at all . " He looked at herappraisingly . " You 're a good sport , all right . I tell you . I figure the sooner we get any traveling done the better . The rains are coming stronger all the time and walking 's getting hard . " " Do we cross the river ? " He shook his head . " No . Not on that road . It lies the other way . " He held out his hands for her to rise . " It 's pretty going through the woods . " " I 'm sure it is . " They had made the journey and come home . Jeff sat on the steps . He chewed a blade of citronella and gazed with admiration at the operations of a family of wasps beneath the thatch . Marion in her room was unpacking her trunks and arranging things . A dozen times it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , but the yellow brightness of the afternoon dissuaded him He heard her moving about inside  --  his wife  --  and was filled with placid enjoyment . She certainly was better company than Gene . " Jeff ! " she called . " What ? were you just being polite ? This is the mail I brought from Molala . " She sat down and began to try to unbuckle the strap . He reached out . " Let 's see it . I know how to work that thing . " He opened the bag expertly and shook the contents on the floor . There were half-a-dozen letters , several rolled magazines , and a bulky package . He picked it up curiously and weighed it . " What the deuce is this It 's heavy enough . " She leaned over his shoulder to read the label . " ' American Express Company , Paris . ' What on earth ? " Totton broke the cords with a jerk and shook the contents out between them . There was a cascade of color . Pamphlets , time-tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . Jeff snapped his fingers . " Gosh , I 'd forgot all about it . I wrote five months or more ago for this stuff . " Her hands were busy among the papers . " What a grand idea ! All my life this has been my favorite reading . Baden-Baden , Paris in Five Days , Cote d'Azur , ' " she read aloud . " What fun ! . . . What 's the matter ? " His face had suddenly gone gray . He got up stiffly , averting his face from her . " What is it ? " she insisted . " Have I said anything ? " He shook his head . " Nothing , I tell you . You have n't said anything . " She scrambled to her feet and tried to put her arms around him . He shook her off angrily . " Nothing , I tell you . I . . I just thought , there 's a gang working to-day I 've got to see . I 'll he back around . . . around dinnertime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without turning his head , along the yard path , and vanished beyond the hedge . Marion stood watching him , wonderingly . Her glance wandered back to the pile of folders about her feet . After a moment  --  a still and troubled moment  --  she leaned over and picked them up . Slowly she untangled the wrapping cord and retied the bundle . The sun climbed to zenith . Week after week the thunder rumbled and for uninterrupted days there was nothing but the gurgle of the rain . Green slime grew upon boots . Lamps set burning continually in the clothes presses were ineffectual against the mold . A cloud of driving mist hung forever above the forest . Down the hill behind the cook-shed one might see the shabby huts of Lolill town , the smoke spiralling through the soggy thatch . The rough bamboo doors were always up and no one moved abroad . Africa was waiting for the terror of the year to pass . The sun , so rarely seen , veered northward up toward the far-away desert . The rains dwindled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night one heard again the far-away hoarse shouting of the apes . The vivid dome of sky was cloudless and a new quality of silence settled down . Imprisoned by the rains , they had talked endlessly , and at length they had exhausted talk and fallen silent . The present , the drowsy , empty , waiting present supplied few incidents , few materials for thought . There were no people to gossip of , few books , no gaieties . Their pasts , they found , touched nowhere . His was concerned with places , hers with people the other had not known . For weeks , intermittently , she tried to draw him out and at Icing last realized that it was not taciturnity which slowed his tongue , but the mere eventIessness of his life . Thirty years of cutting timber in the bush . That was all . But the future existed . They could , of course , she told herself , not wait indefinitely . Jeff explained one night that he was going away for two weeks . The river had sufficiently subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs down to the coast for sale . " There 's a Hamburg buyer coming up the river this year as far as a launch will bring him and he says " ? Totten tapped a letter brought by runner that afternoon ? " he 'll give me the same price per ton they pay in Molala . I 'll get ' em down and come back as soon as I 've turned them over to him . He 's setting up a factory . And I 'll bring back some supplies . Figure out what you need . " He studied her face as he spoke . " Feeling all right ? " " Certainly . Why ? " He patted her hand . " Nothing , I only thought ? . . You 'll take care of yourself while I 'm gone ? Never forget your quinine or anything ? I . . . I guess I 'm not much at saying things . But I suppose you know what you mean to me ? " Totton 's method of moving logs was unique in the Gaboon . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodsmen sent the timbers down in clumsy , bumping rafts . He rode them in midstream . The chances of the current berthed the released logs among the rushy shallows at the sides of a pool forty miles downstream . On the third morning all preliminaries were done and at daybreak he began . He wore spike-soled shoes , khaki trousers and a ragged , short-sleeved shirt . The strap of his helmet was caught beneath his under lip . With marvellous precision he wielded a long pronged pole with a hinged thumb of steel . With the delight of a dancer he ran out upon the lunging , rolling timbers , straightening , directing , disentangling them . New pieces continually pounded down . He received them , shepherded them and , two days later when the count tallied , started them by twos and threes upon the final course . Parties of laborers followed , but they worked ashore and in the shallows . On the shining , majestic flood he rode alone as master . The vivid hours and days of dominance gave him complete peace . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inactive months of rains . Lord , he 'd forgotten how good he was ! He vaulted lightly from a rolling log , found foothold on another , set it turning with a running motion of his feet , and freed it from temporary bondage in shoal mud . He 'd forgotten Papa Djombe ! What sweep , what grandeur , what self-sufficiency it had . . . . It came to him that in some way , in some insubstantial way , it had been contemptible of Gene to let Djombe get him . It had been too big for Gene . But for him it was just right . They understood each other . They were partners . They were bound for the sea together . He 'd nearly forgotten the old contract they had made . He smiled . Down to the sea ! How the yellow river swam and bubbled between the high walls of jungle green . How superb was the feel of the pounding sun on his back . Down to the sea ! He rode a giant log , head up , lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a casual tilt of the pole held crosswise of his breast sufficed to steady him . All about him like a school of colossal porpoises floated black lengths of timbers , bumping , rolling , sucking , all moving easily downward . And he  --  he , Jeff Totton , only fifty-one years old ? was lord of it all ! In a shoal of elephant grass near one bank some logs were entangled . A dozen tall native men , waist-deep in water , their wet brown bodies gleaming in the sunlight , were struggling to set them right . Their high soft-noted cries of direction echoed across the water to him . Totton spiked a nearby log , drew it lightly toward him , stepped off upon it , repeated the process twice , and jumped into the shallows . The difficulty was obvious to him . With a friendly gesture he brushed aside the laborers and thrust his pole at the point where one log slightly overlapped another . One slight heave , he knew , and they would be quiet upon their courses again . The pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust and forced again . His hands slipped , he stumbled forward and fell , striking his chin on the coarse bark and splashing full-length in the muddy water . A half-dozen men solicitously helped him to his feet . His head swam drunkenly and they half carried him ashore , where he sat heavily on the hot ground . At a nod from him they returned to work . A young negro took the spiked pole , twisted it as he had done , and the timbers floated free . Someone brought the stick and laid it beside him . They continued on their way ; in a moment were gone in the waving reeds . Totton took off his helmet and with shaking hands wiped the sweat and water from his hair . He felt his stubbled chin . It was slightly cut and damnably sensitive . And his head felt heavy . There was no hurry , he told himself . He stared moodily across the glaring sheen of water to the high green barrier of trees on the far bank . He spoke , half aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes . The exhaustion of the week past seemed suddenly to overwhelm him . His fingers were tremulous , his heart was pounding too rapidly . The rivulets of sweat that oozed and ran upon his wet body made him irritable . He pondered earnestly whether the young black had succeeded with the pole where he had failed because of their difference in years . At fifty-one perhaps a man did grow clumsy . He remembered he had read somewhere that after fifty the most notable change was that recovery of any sort , was slower . Possibly . It was ridiculous to he so knocked out by a little tap on the chin . It would n't do to wait forever . . He opened his eyes . There , smoothly , agelessly , and forever , ran the river , the immortal , vagrant , majestic soul of the vast woods , Djombe " River that he 'd planned so long to follow away from waiting . . away from the long , long waste of years . . . . As he watched , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips hardened . No damn ' use in being childish about it . Might as well face it clearly . That dream was out . Marion had changed all that . There was n't enough money for two and that was that . If they quit , the savings would last them no more than eight or nine years . Then there would be nothing ahead . There were n't any jobs for a tropical timberman outside of the tropics , certainly not for a man of fifty-one . There was a long hiatus in his thoughts and then , like the turning of regular wheels , he began again . He wondered very carefully if another might chance it . No , he thought not . Starting all over again was n't the game for anything but youth . It simply was n't any way possible . No .. . Poor Marion . What a cruel trap it had been for her . But at least , he smiled sourly , she 'd outlast him . She 'd get away sometime . Get away on his money . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " The words spoke themselves aloud . He moistened his lips , looked furtively over his shoulder to see if anyone was by to overhear . Sun-drowsed desolation only . He pressed his palms to his eyes till bright spots swam in the dark . What a queer chance stroke it would be if she should die first . Malaria , the river , there were a thousand chances . . . . He could kill her . A gasping , startled grunt forced out of him . He felt a sudden nauseated terror . He scrambled hastily to his feet and , grabbing up his stick , began to run , breasting the cutting grass , leaping over obstacles , splashing furiously through water till he streamed and panted in the sun . A vision of her soft mouth , her lonely eyes swam before him , and his heart ached with love for her . Oh . my God . . . He loved her . He loved her . It must be that he was going mad . For a day Marion had enjoyed being alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banish all reflection , all troubling , whispering , confusing doubts . Then gradually the silence seemed to press upon her like an accumulating weight . She slapped shut the covers of a book  --  a poor and futile novel read through for the third time  --  and got up from her chair . Aimlessly she began to walk about the house . The shutters were up , and the cool gloom inside , streaked with mote-filled lines of light , held a slight quality of mystery . Even in that drab and too familiar place one might still make discoveries . She smiled whimsically to herself . At least the dull old house at home had had an attic . How deceiving dreams were . To come to Africa , to the continent of magic and of danger , and mind because it did n't have an attic . Merely silence , silence and such a brooding loneliness it nearly drove one mad . " Do n't , " she whispered aloud , " be an ungrateful little beast . " She examined the ragged row of books on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could recite the titles and authors accurately from left to right . She thought so . A narrow , short little volume nearly hidden between two stout treatises caught her eye and she took it out . She read the inked inscription on the board cover . " Personal Accounts of Geoffrey Totton . " After a moment 's hesitation she took it to the verandahto study it . Surely Jeff would n't mind . For a time the figures were incomprehensible . The order was chronological only . The first record , in ink already turning brown , was of a deposit of one hundred and nine dollars in a New York savings hank eleven years before . Another deposit followed , another , and then the pages were thickened by innumerable little printed slips of paper pasted carefully in and interlarded with other inked insertions . One clipping seemed to be from a life insurance circular and dealt with expectation of life reckoned on from the years of middle age . Leafing through , she found a number of tables , on the heavily sized paper of tourist circulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and America . Near the end were three pages packed with an incomprehensible medley of figures  --  hut from them emerged a clear total and intention . Marion , her eyes misting , examined them , then softly closed the book . She understood . This , then , was the record of Jeff 's life and the statement of his hopes . He had saved and put away a little over fourteen thousand dollars . And by his reckonings , his clippings , his childish , remote investigation of the world outside  --  the world he knew so little of  --  he had assured himself this money would suffice for him and for the time he visioned might remain to him . The last note in the book bore a date three days before that humid afternoon when he had carried her in his arms across the hammock bridge . To judge by the dust , he had not touched it since . She had destroyed all that for him . She and Gene . And Djombe River . That shabby , labored little book held hope for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one chance might select . For him or her . For one .. for one . She covered her face with her hands and tried to think . The roar of the river falls behind the hill seemed to grow in volume till it filled the afternoon , to wash and stir and whisper in her mind . Getting up , she found her helmet and walked slowly down the path , through the murmurous high woods and out upon the swinging bridge . She leaned against the latticed slope and fixed her half-closed eyes on the shining stream . Very softly she asked aloud , " Djombe River ? " The weird , live whispering went on . The long months of drought were a trying time . The days that followed Jeff 's return had been violent with a quality of passion they did not dare to understand . They had confronted each other white and timorous and sprung to refuge in a close embrace . But that mood also passed . Totton found himself doing the work he had to do with a dull fury . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would take a bright axe from a negro woodsman and clang it viciously , heedless of the sharp chips that snapped and jabbed against him . Again and again , when they sat wordless in the lamplight in the hot nights , without warning in the woods , in the leaden moments of the morning before Aloki 's horn , the thought of the riverbank like a knife stab would return and he would wish her dead so that he might again be free . Then in a flood of terror , pity , and remorseful love , it would be gone again . Totton returned from the woods one late afternoon to find her sitting in a canvas chair on the verandah , her hands folded in her lap . He took off his hat , wiped the sweat from his face and neck and looked down at her . She returned his smile lightly . " Tired ? " " No . . . What are you doing ? " Marion lifted her open hands . " Noth-ing . " He leaned back against a rough-hewn supporting pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " She shook her head . " No more than it does for you . Really not . " " Maybe that 's so , " he said heavily . At the end of a long pause he spoke again . " I got an idea . . . . How would you like to go down to Molala ? Just for a vacation , I mean . It 's not much of a place , but they have movies at the caf ? . And there are some people to talk to . Judge Morin for one . It would be a change anyway . What do you think ? " She examined her bands in her lap and considered . " It would be fun . Of course . " Her voice caught uncertainly and she stopped and looked levelly up into his face . " Can we afford it ? " " Sure . " He sat on the steps , facing down the hill . " We have n't talked about it much , but I guess you know how matters stand that way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to think it was quite a pile , but it is n't near enough to do anything real with . But in the meantime I do n't see any point in hanging on to it so tight as I used to . I got you into sort of a jam . " " Or I did you , " she interrupted softly . " We 'll let that pass . Anyway , here we are , and if we can have any fun around this rotten country we might as well . We could buy some things while we were down . I thought maybe a phonograph and some records would be nice . And we can buy every book we can find . Some loads of tinned stuff would be a change from country chop . And you can get some clothes . " " All right . " He turned to look at her , but her eyes were down . " When did you think you wanted to go ? " she asked . " Why , right away . I been working so damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Six or seven weeks would n't matter . What 's the odds , anyway ? The company does n't know any better'n my hat what happens off here just so long as they get a shipment every year . I 'll have that for them always . It 's got to be a habit . There 's nothing to keep you , is there ? " " I suppose not . " " No social engagements or anything ? " he asked bitterly . " I 'd rather wait just the same . For a month or two . " " Why ? " " Must I have a reason ? " He got impatiently to his feet . " You do n't have to do anything . Not even talk sense if you do n't want to . You 're a woman . " He stopped , then an idea occurred to him . " Do n't put it off too long . The rains begin in March . " She nodded . " And the river gets high . " " I know . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . .. . Not that I care much . I 'm used to this place in all weathers . " He made a turn of the porch , his boots creaking noisily on the loose boards . He came to a halt in front of her again . " You feel like a little walk ? I got to go down to the other side of the river and see how the boys are making out . " She rose with alacrity . " I 'd love to . Just a second and I 'll get my hat . " When they reached the path in the forest she took his arm companionably . " Even if I am horrid and difficult , you know I love you , do n't you , Jeff ? " " Sure . You 're not . . . " She pressed his arm tighter . " You know I 'm not ungrateful ? You 'll remember that ? Whatever happens ? " He looked at her hastily . He tried to speak teasingly but his voice cracked . " Certainly . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing bad , at least . But maybe I do n't understand ? " " Perhaps not . Let 's talk of something else . " They did not start until the rains began . Marion betrayed a quiet , unreasonable stubbornness of which Jeff had not known her capable . Her vegetable garden on the hillside could not be left . The unremitting heat of the Long Dries was far worse than rain . The discussion held an unreality which troubled him . A hundred times his lips opened to vent the one telling argument and as often snapped uneasily shut again . It would not do to remind her that Djombk flood had killed her fiance . He reflected methodically upon possible danger . It existed , of course . Gene had proved that with terrible conclusiveness . But the prospect slid over his consciousness without finding entrance or deep meaning . Reasonable precautions , sober judgments , these things had gone stale in him since the plan of his life had altered . Yet his feeling of dominance of the forest and its chances remained . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jungled world was not . . . . Perhaps she was not afraid because she trusted him . Nothing would happen ... quite evidently , nothing ever would . The blast upon Aloki 's horn the morning of departure found them already awake . They had been roused long before by the movement of the waiting men in the morning dark . Twelve natives from Lolill town were to porter for them . In sleepy silence they drank black coffee , strapped the final boxes , and gave orders for the start . The dawn came as they were leaving the yard . The twelve men , the boxes on their heads , were already jogging down the hill . Marion touched Jeff 's hand and turned to look back . The eastern sky was roseate and streaked with gold . Against it the squat silhouette of the little house seemed somber , desolate , a futile , ugly little human thing to be framed so magically . They had left it only an instant since , but emptiness appeared to have settled in eternally . " A phonograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeff suggested . " In a way , I 've loved it as it is , " she answered . She took his hand and , bending her head a little , held it to her cheek , her eyes still fastened on the dark house and the grandeur of the sky be-yond . " I 've grown up , Jeff , " she said softly , " I 'm afraid you think I 've been discontented , but it is n't true . I 've had a chance few ever have , deeply to know one person and one place . And our river . That , I know , is immortal , so it can not matter greatly if I 'm not . " She gently released his hand . " There is so much time , Jeff dear . . . " He could find no answer to that reassurance , and she went on as if there had been no halt , " People in Africa have always complained , have n't they , that they feel shrunken and trivial because everything here is so vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard something like that , " Jeff answered . " Look here , those carriers will get so far ahead we 'll be half the day catching up with them . " " There 's no real hurry , is there ? Please . . Totton opened his mouth , shut it , and shook his head . " I guess there 's no hurry . " " Why should anyone complain ? " she insisted , " I mean of feeling small and unimportant ? It seems to me that that simplifies things so much . . . . Jeff , when I was a little girl I used to dream that when I grew up I was going to be terribly important and should do important things . But I never should have , of course , and then I should have been unhappy . . . . It 's much more comfortable , " she ended slowly , " to realize that all a little person needs to do is a very little thing . " Totton laughed abruptly . " You give a man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're talking about any more than I do . Let 's get along . " They looked together once again toward the bungalow . Marion waved her hand . " I feel kind of funny , leaving it , " Jeff confessed . " Suppose when we come back we pull the damn thing down and build a new one ? I can order some stuff in Molala . Hardware and things . We can figure out what we need . No point in not being comfortable . " He scuffed his feet through the low grass , dully regretted having spoken . He had meant to be enthusiastic , boyish ; and he realized he had failed . Marion made no response and , quickening his pace , he strode ahead . The trail , after all , was too narrow for them to walk abreast . Within an hour he overtook the porters . They sat by their loads , their tiny clay pipes in their pursed lips , and long before he came to them he could hear the gentle singsong of their talk , talk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and watched him shyly as he passed . From then on the caravan kept consistent order , Totton , then the carriers , and Marion alone behind them all . The men reached the town at the end of the day 's march so long before her that Totton spent an hour of irritable concern . But when she came in sight he gulped his anger with a sensation of remorse . There was , of course , no hurry . There was so much time . In the immortal woods haste was as ridiculous as life itself . . . . There was bitterly little satisfaction in that faith . Soon the long shadows of the trees reached out to shelter the twilit town . Toward nine o'clock the third morning from Lolitl the path sloped upward , the trees thinned and gave way to shabby , littered native fields . In a few moments Totton heard the sound of swiftly running water and quickened his pace till he reached the high bank . Below him swirled the river . This was the place where Gene Bryce had drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , almost to the day . From this place Marion , because she had not known what else to do , had kept on along the path , along the path to where he waited for her . His lips felt withered and he licked them carefully . He focussed his eyes on the current until they felt dry and strained . He wet his lips again , with measured care took off his ragged helmet , found a handkerchief , and wiped the rain from the channels in his cheeks . A wood-pigeon cooed in a tree top . A breath of wind rattled the raindrops noisily amid the leaves . So this was where Gene had died . . What a slender , slender chance to cause such changes . If it had not happened , what different courses would their three lives have run ? A chance , a mere trick , an accident . And yet  --  the idea spread insistently through his consciousness  --  how curiously hard it was to associate empty chance with Djombe River . If ever a thing bespoke more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Africa had made him as superstitious as a native . But what . . but what if the chance ? or plan  --  had taken her instead ? He would never have seen her , never loved her , and he would be free . There was enough for one . " Oh , God damn it ! " The words came out of him aloud in a grunting cry . He shook his head like a dog with burrs in its ears , squeezing one hand over the other so violently they hurt . The voices of the carriers became audible , and he tensed his long body stiffly and began an examination of the crossing . For the first time he became conscious of the bridge tree they had felled to take the place of the one that had been smashed away . He saw that it was dangerously slight , less than a foot in diameter . The trouble of his mind turned to irritation . The porters had come up and stood behind him . He turned to a man he knew had been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist in his face and pointed behind with the other hand . " What 's the idea ? " he shouted . " You no savvy small stick no be fit for bridge ? You black bastards too bloody lazy to cut big size , huh ? " The wet brown forehead , wrinkled by the weight of the heavy box above it , puckered with mystification . " No , sah , yes , sah ! " the porter spluttered . " ' No , sah , yes , sah , ' you damn ' fool ! " Totton 's open hand slapped the man 's face . Marion 's voice made him drop his arm . His breath came gustily . " What 's the matter , Jeff ? " He took her by the arm , turned his back on the startled blacks , and conducted her to the riverbank . With an effort he steadied and lowered his voice . " I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm tired or something . Do n't say anything to that poor devil . I . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But look , " he pointed to the log , " that fool job made me sore . " " You mean it 's small ? Do n't blame them . If it was wrong I should have said so at the time . We crossed quite easily a year ago by holding hands . " There was a pause . Her hand in his , they watched the running stream . " Aloki told me , Jeff , " Marion said dreamily , " that the natives believe Papa Djombe is a god , all-powerful and all-wise . I wonder . . . I wonder if that is n't true ? " " People out here get queer ideas . .. . Let 's get along . You 've got into the worst habit of wasting time . " " I promise , dearest , I wo n't any more . " Jeff beckoned . " Come on , you boys . " One by one the negroes scrambled through the lopped and withered branches till they stood upon the trunk . They balanced their loads carefully on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sidle across . The carrier Jeff had struck hung back doubtfully , his soft eyes on his master . Totton smiled at him kindly . " Come on , boy . You catch hold here and Mammy , she go between us . " He helped the man up and adjusted his load for him . He assisted Marion to a position between them . The porter took one of her hands and he the other . They were in a linked line now , with the first man already two-thirds over . Marion disengaged their grips and took them by the wrists instead . " This way will be better , Jeff , " she said . A muffled quality in her voice made him eye her curiously . They moved out along the bridge . The river , a yard under them , swam dizzily . One pace , two , three . .. . The line tautened , stretched out till their arms were lifted high , hands pulling hands . Linked fists along the way see-sawed erratically to preserve the delicate balance . The log was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid and shuffled sideways . Totton 's position was most difficult . As last man his support was slightest . He wished Marion had not insisted on taking his wrist . It gave him no control , complicated his equilibrium . . . With a spasm of sudden nausea he felt her grip relax . He teetered , waved his arms . He saw her hands go up . She lunged down so swiftly it almost seemed she leaped . The splash she made flung water in his face . In the same instant he saw the man ahead , unbalanced by his heavy load , begin to fall . Jeff staggered forward , seized the porter by an arm , and they fell together crosswise of the log , clinging by knees and elbows . The breath smacked out of him . The porter 's pack struck the water with a second splash . By the time he had turned about Marion had vanished . Totton hung to the trunk , stunned . His mind was reeling and he felt as if he were strangling from shock and horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the near bank and leaped down . The other porters had reached the farther side in safety and were running through the grass downstream . They searched through the reeds at every bend all that day and camped at night at the crossing in hastily made grass shelters . They had not found her . Djombe gave up nothing . At dusk the carriers made little fires and crouched around them . Totton sat apart from them on a charred , wet logthat lay half concealed in weeds . His manner was dazed and dull and old . Since the morning his lips had been locked in a thin , gray line . A thorn had torn his shirt nearly from him and his bronzed shoulders , relaxed and queerly futile , showed through . He rose stiffly and walked to the river 's edge . The negroes by the fires raised their eyes and watched him furtively . A yellow moon , low in the sky , illumined the commencement of the night . A shimmering lane crossed the black water . Marion was dead . Papa Djombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the fault was his . That realization had slowly permeated all his mind . She had missed her footing , thrown up her hands to save herself , and fallen . And he had saved the negro . The devil in him that had wished her dead had made the choice . It was clear to him . He was sure , now that the day was done , that he had worked it out . Their hopeless seeking in the muddy reeds had given him no respite from the painful winding and unwinding of his thoughts . He was not an imaginative man . But surely all things must have cause and reason . Sometimes they were obscure , but he held the deep conviction that there was one certain guide . If one faced things squarely . His father back in Michigan had called it conscience . . . . Yes , he could have caught her . There had been a choice and , driven by the fearful wish that had so tortured him , he had let her fall and had not put out his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shattered ruin that his life had suddenly become the placing of the blame was one thing solid . If destiny were wholly foolish chance one would gropingly go mad . There were accounts that must be balanced , penance to be paid . . . . His tongue felt woolen . His lips opened stupidly , and a word came through . " Murder ! " He fuddled the syllables like a drunken mart . The mask of his face in the moonlight bore no expression . Only his eyes seemed alive . They watched with wondering intensity the flow of the current where it vanished in the blackness under overhanging trees . Judge Morin sat with friends on the terrace of the Hotel Grand . Although it was not yet six , the cafe was already nearly filled . The barefoot waiters shuffled busily between the little green iron tables . Occasionally a loud fizzing and the rattle of a Perrier top on the concrete floor sounded out above the hum of talk . Pernod ? Grenadine  --  Rafael  --  Byrrh ? the glasses clinked and lifted happily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief interrupted himself in mid-epigram . " Look , Morin , is that not your friend ? " The Judge leaped to his feet and rushed forward . " My dear friend Totton ! But how delightful ! You have arrived just now ? " Totton shook hands . " I wanted particularly to see you . I went over to the Tribunal , but when there was n't anyone around I figured you 'd be over here . " His drawn face lighted in a fleeting smile , then settled to lines of dogged pain . " Ah , I see . " Morin bobbed his head with quick understanding . " I suspect you mean privately . Then let us sit here . " He scraped back a chair . " It is so pleasant to see you  --  still more if I can help you . " " I do n't want to take too much of your time . Keep you from your friends . " Jeff leaned back with drooping shoulders , and his hands fell mute between his knees . He looked wearily ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you not because you were my friend . . " The words were spoken so flatly they seemed to have no meaning . It was as if they had been memorized . " But because of your job , " he went on . " Officially , understand ? I came to give myself up . " Morin moved creakingly in his chair . An explosion of loud laughter came from some men at a nearby table . He leaned nearer . " Perhaps , " he suggested quietly , " you had better explain from the beginning ? " Jeff gave him a quick look and his eyes fell again . " You knew I was married , did n't you ? . " " The missionary Gunter came through six months ago . But tell me as if I knew nothing . " Totton cleared his throat with a nervous jerk and after a moment 's fumbling began . One clipped , matter-of-fact sentence followed the next through the whole , long , weary story which he told . Once he stopped and with shaking hand carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray smoke droop away . Now and then it was necessary for Jeff to raise his voice to be heard above the crackling laughter and the pop of corks . " I did n't think about the money for a long time .. . I was in a kind of dream at first . Then it came to me , just as a proposition , you know , that if she were dead , everything would be like it was before . . . . Though I loved her , I could n't keep it out of my head . It kept coming back and back . It wore me out . . . I 'm getting old , Morin . . . . Somehow the river was all mixed up in my mind . I did n't think at the moment , though she said something queer , but she made us let go her hands and took the boy 's wrist and mine and held on that way ... . " " What was it she said ? " Morin inter rupted softly . He had let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he better this way . ' . . . It seems funny now . The point is , something made me grab for the boy instead . And I could have saved her if I 'd wanted to . It 's the same as if I 'd done it all . . . . So I thought it over that night and came on down here . There was n't anything else to do . . . . " There was silence between them for a moment . Morin ground out his cold cigarette with elaborate care . " Have you , then , " he asked almost in a whisper , " no longer your desire ? There is ? " his voice caught ? " there is a ship to-morrow . " Totton wiped a hand tremulously across his face . " Why , why no . No , I do n't believe I have . Not after all that 's happened . " Morin bent nearer . " Ali , but why not ? " He touched the back of Jeff 's hand with a soft forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? That you do not realize what that girl has done ? And why ? " His brown eyes misted surprisingly . " What do you mean ? " ' It will be better this way , ' " he quoted . " Surely , surely you understand  --  your river and she ? " " I do n't know what you mean . I thought it all out and I came down to you . . . . You 've . . . you 've got to arrest me . I 've got to make it square . " Morin jerked a hand through the air . " Dismiss that , please , " he said impatiently . " Please , " be repeated . He took one of Totton 's hands in his with the delicate gentleness of a woman . " I would so like to be of help . We must find a reason  --  we must ; we are so small we must explain . " He hesitated and moved his left hand in a vague gesture . " Africa , Africa , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might grasp it , M'sieu Jeff . I am sure of that . There is something final and assured . In Africa there is no conflict , we arc too small for that ; there is merely  --  there is merely the solution . " He continued , almost pleading , " For you , your river points it . For me . . I am not yet sure . . . But in this immensity a man need have no sense of waste . Follow your river , my dear friend . Call it simple accident , if you will , but just as it carries your logs and has ruled your life these many years , it has now made all clear for the time ahead . It willed , she helping , that her time and her adventure were complete . She was , T imagine , quite content . Her love for you found out the perfect gesture . . . . Do not , do not betray her plan ! Follow your river ! " He rose to his feet , trembling with the force of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more at present . There is so much , so much to think . To-morrow . Sleep well to-night . " Totton watched dumbly while Morin 's short figure vanished through the doorway in the dark . He had put out his hand too late to stay him . For a moment he looked dazedly over the heads and shoulders of the cafe crowd . Then he put on his helmet and climbed the stairs to his room . He sat for a long time trying to review his thoughts . A deep lassitude pervaded him . He felt vaguely cheated . Perhaps he had been mad , but there had been so much satisfaction in the decision to come to Morin and confess . It had set a period to wondering . . . . But he had , he had grabbed the boy instead . You could n't altogether get away from that . Suppose . .. suppose Morin was right . That she had leaped deliberately . That she had loved him so much as that .. . Extraordinary it had n't occurred to him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moan came through his parted lips , his back bent , and he buried his face in his hands . No , in God 's name , not that . . . better anything than that . Then what to do ? He looked at the row of trunks along the wall  --  his things and Marion 's . If he was going to go away he 'd have to make arrangements . Have to repack and get rid of things . Have to go back to the bungalow  --  to the empty bungalow that stood so lonely on the hill against the sunrise . Have to arrange for a successor . A living man could n't simply quit . . . . How futile it would seem . How empty everything must seem forever . Love had gone and there could be no more adventure . A scraping phonograph began to play downstairs . He got up , locked the door behind him , and left the hotel . The unlighted streets were ghostly and deserted . Occasionally a shape would pass him in the dark and a soft voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Bon soir , m'sieu . " The vague figure would dissolve and leave him alone again . The road he followed aimlessly ended on a rise that overlooked the silent harbor . He stopped and the scene enveloped him like a caress . The yellow crescent lay a shining trail across the water . The mastlights of a ship moored in midstream swung a little back and forth across the blue-black sky . Tiny fires along the water 's edge showed where native boatmen cooked their evening meal . IEs memory harked back . Memories now must always take the place of dreams . There was nothing any to-morrow could offer half so precious as the past . " This is the most beautiful country I have ever seen , " she had said to him that sunset hour a year ago . . . He slowly picked his way down a steep path that led to the waterside . Where the trail went through deep shadow near the border of the road he stumbled over someone and nearly fell . A figure hastened apologetically to its feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had saved from Djombe River . " I sorry , massa . I sleep and I no see you . " " That 's all right . Go back to sleep . Good night . " They both spoke softly , in voices appropriate to the night . A hundred yards farther on he passed the last of the silent stores . A spit of land sloped down to the river 's edge . He went down it , avoiding the littered refuse in the grass . The tide ran out and the ripples of the current softly lipped the land . Beyond there somewhere in the dark Djombe River joined the sea . The great , wild river of the woods was here serene and old at last . A calm peace came over him . . What was it Morin had said ? " Do not betray her plan . . . . Follow your river ... it has made all clear for you . . . . In Africa there is no conflict , we are too small for that . . . " Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end . . .. Follow your river . .. . He too had adventured . They were partners . . . Perhaps after all there was a plan , a cause and reason , some circle to be joined . He hesitated , turned , and retraced his steps to the road . By one of the warehouses he stopped and called softly . " Boy . " " Sah ? " The negro got sleepily to his feet and came to him . " Boy , you savvy where my other boy be ? " " Yes , massa . " Jeff reached into his pocket and put a roll of paper money into the porter 's hand . " You get ' em sun time to-morrow and go for Lolill ? You savvy ? " " Yes , massa . " Totton returned to the point of land . He took off his helmet , placed it on a discarded packing box , and put a heavy stone in it to keep it from blowing away . " As if when the waiting were over , the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that afternoon so long ago . .. . He walked into the water . Three long strides and he was swimming . With strong , easy strokes he directed his course out toward the open sea . In a moment the dark banks had faded , merged into the tropic night . " Follow your river . . . Djombe River . . . " In this immensity a man need have no sense of waste . . . . ( The End )
