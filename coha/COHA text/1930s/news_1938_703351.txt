txt Harry L. Hopkins , WPA Administrator , looks for serious relief problems in most industrial centers in the near future . Crises , similar to those in Chicago and Cleveland , Ohio , are likely to be repeated in qther places when resources of families , hard-hit by last fall 's sudden employment slump , become exhausted , Mr. Hopkins believes . Twenty-five states are paying unemployment benefits to approximately , 800,000 insured jobless , but after the paying period ends most of these people will have to fall back on relief , WPA rolls now carrying 2,600,000 families , are increasing every week . Mr. Hopkins told a congressional committee the other day that he will be able to take care of a peak load of 3,100,000 with the money carried in President Roosevelt 's spending bill . State Funds Sought In most places , as in Chicago and Cleveland , solution of relief problems will depend on the success local authorities have in prying funds loose from state legislatures . Mr. Hopkins refuses to take any blame for the Chicago and Cleveland situations . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more than doubled in recent weeks . In Cleveland , the quota has been increased from 20,000 to 70,000 persons ; in Chicago from 50,000 to 120,000 . " I think the responsibility for this situation ought to be put squarely where it belongs , " Mr. Hopkins declared , " All the responsible citizens in both places are agreed that this responsibility is the State 's . " The State of Ohio has ample funds to meet the direct relief problem and it seems to me they should do it . " In Illinois , the State Legislature has failed to appropriate $9,000,000 that is in the State Treasury for relief purposes . " Direct relief appropriations for the country as a whole have been flattening out as the Federal Government enlarged the WPA , Mr. Hopkins said , A report from the Social Security Board showed it has sent out more than 10,500,000 benefit checks to jobless workers in 25 states where unemployment insurance laws have gone into effect . Most of the 25 states launched their benefit programs on Jan. 1 of this year with benefits becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-weeks waiting period , in accordance with state law . Since the payment period only runs from 14 to 16 weeks , depending on state law , those on the rolls at the beginning will soon be off . Wisconsin , only State to begin its benefit program prior to this year , paid out $3,800,000 from Jan. 1 to April 30 compared with $2,200,000 between August , 1936 when payments began and Jan. 1 , 1938 . New York State has issued $24 , - 000,000 in benefit checks since Jan. 1 ; Pennsylvania , $24,500,000 ; and Massachusetts , $8,000,000 . A similar picture of seriousness in the national relief situation was painted in a radio address by Senator Alva B. Adams ( D ) of Colorado , Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee considering the President 's spending bill . Describing the industrial decline as the most " precipitous " in the nation 's financial history , Senator Adams said the " WPA has made strenuous efforts to aid but the situation is still deplorable . " Farm Surplus Problem Quoting Henry A. Wallace , Secretary of Agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the acute distress of the present year , After talking to the press , Mr. Hopkins presided over a discussion at the Mayflower Hotel at . which friends of the Federal Arts Program heard its administrators defend it and assert that it could be carried on to advantage for the next 50 years . Directors of the theater , art and music projects under supervision of Mrs. Ellen Woodward , assistant to Mr. Hopkins , told how they had decentralized their arts by carrying them to the far corners of the country . The director of the Writers ' Project , described the WPA guidebook series as the " biggest publishing job in the United States , twice as big as the Dictionary of American Biography .
