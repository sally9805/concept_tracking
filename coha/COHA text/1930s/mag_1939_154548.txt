Two and a half years ago when the late Capitalist Andrew William Mellon made his last grandiose gesture and presented the nation not only with a fabulous collection of art works but money and plans for a National Gallery worthy of housing them in Washington , he expressed the hope that it would " attract other gifts from other citizens who may in the future desire to contribute works of art of the highest quality to form a great national collection . " First notable collector to live up to Andy Mellon 's expectations is 5-10-25 Storeman Samuel Henry Kress , who last week came forward with a donation of 375 paintings and 18 pieces of sculpture valued at about $30,000,000-more than half as costly as that made by the unfinished Gallery 's founder . <P> In accepting what is reputed to be the world 's greatest private Italian collection , in the name of the U. S. people , President Roosevelt thanked Storeman Kress for setting an example that is " a decided step in the realization of the true purpose of the National Gallery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some years now he has been giving and lending noteworthy pieces from his collection to small but deserving museums throughout the nation . San Antonio , Charlotte , N. C. , Montgomery , Wichita , Seattle , Memphis , Phoenix , Savannah and Macon have received permanent additions to their collections . New York , San Francisco , Milan and Brescia , Italy are currently exhibiting temporary loans of Kress art . <P> So unobtrusive has Mr. Kress been in the assembling , lending and giving of his masterpieces that the announcement of the gift to Washington came as a popular surprise . Only persons long associated with him in this undertaking have been Stephen Pichetto , the Metropolitan 's restorer and technical adviser of painting , Florence Art Dealer Count A. Contini-Bonacossa , and for a period , the late Lord Duveen . A merchant who cultivated his mind while he was accumulating his chain of 240 stores , Mr. Kress did not need much help . It was about 25 years ago that he first started making large-scale purchases . Every summer he took time off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came back with some important token , which he personally hung on the already crowded walls of his rambling duplex penthouse on upper Fifth Avenue . Unmarried , he called his pictures his " children . " <P> As head of a huge clan , he often has his home overflowing with relatives , is called " Uncle Sam " by the kids . No tottering oldster , Uncle Sam Kress at 76 is an erect , handsomely preserved , almost white-headed figure who daily keeps himself in condition at his private gymnasium , credits his clear eye and physical fitness to lifelong moderate habits . <P> When the Kress collection at last comes to its resting place , the National Gallery will be richer by works from the brushes of almost every important master in the Italian school : Giotto , Fra Angelico , Perugino , Filippo Lippi , Pietro di Cosimo , Ghirlandajo , Mantegna , Giovanni Bellini ,
