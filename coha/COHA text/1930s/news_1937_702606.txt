txt Aided by the current extremely high rate of operations which has reduced manufacturing costs per unit of product , Corn Products Refining Co. is showing operating profits during the second quarterVespIte the rapid rise in the . price of corn . Thiftionarititttire selling-method at the ' Industry permits ' " customers to- bu-p  --  at the prices prevailing before an increase in prices , and in times of rapidly rising corn prices , this works to the disadvantage of corn refiners . Nevertheless , Corn Products has been able to continue to operate in the black , aided in part by the favorable location of some of its plants . Thus the company 's Kansas City plant has been able to use some Argentine corn , brought to Gulf ports by ship and thence transported by rail to Kansas City . In addition , the Argo and Pekin plants are located practically at Chicago . Argentine corn pays a 25 cents a bushel duty , but it is still cheaper to use this corn than the domestic product . The April corn grind was nearly 2050 greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high rate . Affiliates to Help Earnings With profit margins reduced this year . Corn Products will obtain a measure of stability of total earning power through income from domestic and foreign affiliates . New England Grain Co. is doing well this year . and Allied Mills , Inc. , in which Corn Products has a minority interest , will pay in June a dividend of $1.50 which will be equal to roughly $180,000 on Corn Products ' holdings of its stock . This would be equal to approximately seven cents a share on Corn Products ' 2,530,000 common shares . Foreign subsidiaries of Corn Products are doing an exceptionally large business at present . Reflecting this , first quarter earnings of Corn Products included dividends from both the Argentine and Japanese subsidiaries , the latter being the first dividend paid by that subsidiary which was organized about four years ago . The plants of these foreign affiliates are much smaller than the three domestic plants . The corn purchases for them , therefore , are for a much longer supply of raw material than for the domestic plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real investment in corn against the almost hand-to-mouth raw material supply for the domestic plants . In times of rising prices such as exist at present , the larger held by these foreign subsidiaries works to their advantage . First Quarter Net Lower In the first quarter of 1937 , Corn Products had net income of 52.205,500 , equal after preferred dividends to 70 cents a common share . A year ago the first quarter showed net of $2,799,990 , equal to 93 cents a common share , and in the second three months ' period of 1936 the net was $2,553,945 , equal to 84 cents a common share . In the first quarter this year " other income , " which includes dividends received from domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates , amounted to $1,014,990 compared with $600,581 in the first quarter last year . In the second quarter of 1936. this " other income " amounted to only $495,583 . Therefore , the dividend received from Allied Mills in the second quarter this year will be equal to about 36% of all " other income " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AssUred This backlog of earning power which the company has never taken in completely in any one year , will probably insure continuity of the present $3 annual dividend rate on the common stock . The company 's directors , it is understood , have given no consideration to any reduction in the dividend nate . Before the depression , extra dividends were paid which brought total annual disbursements up to $4 a share . but extras were omitted with the decline in earnings . At the end of 1936 Corn Products held $11,547,352 of cash and securities with a market value of $14,358.037 . These assets alone were equal to more than $10 a share on the common stock . In addition to the disadvantage of operating with a. raw material whose price is rising sharply , the corn refining industry this year has been plagued by importation of cheap tapioca starch . In the first three months this year , tapioca flour imports were 128,864,000 pounds compared with only 67,834,000 pounds in the first three months of 1936 . About 34 pounds of corn starch can be produced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly with corn starch , the imports in the first three months this year were equal to a corn grind of 3,790,000 bushels compared with 1,995,000 bushels in the corresponding period a year ago . inasmuch as the total corn grind in the United States for domestic consumption in the first three months this year was 17,475,000 bushels , the tapioca imports amounted to nearly 22% of the business done by the industry .
