txt Letters to the Editor BEER AND ECONOMICS . Expenditure for Gratification of Proper Taste Its Own Justification . To the Editor of The New York Times : Redington Fiske Jr. , in THE TIMES of Aug. 26 , argues very ably against the contention of Richard H. Scott , president of the American Business Men 's Prohibition Foundation and of the Reo Motor Car Company , that the $4,000,000,000 which Mr. Scott estimates would be diverted to the beer industry , if re-established , would be turned from the purchase of " wholesome necessities and refreshing luxuries . " Mr. Fiske contends that the restoration of the brewing industry would , by the natural operation of economic law , bring into being other industries , thereby offsetting , to a greater or less extent , the diversion that Mr. Scott predicates . The latter labors under the singular delusion that a new industry can exist only at the expense of old ones and that the purchasing power of a community is fixed within set limits . To justify the authorization of the brewing of , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the legalization of such beer would create other industries . The ultimate purpose of all personal expenditure is the satisfaction of the physical , intellectual or esthetic wants of the spender . Money spent to supply the gratification , within reason , of any physical want , ? not illegitimate per se , contains its own justification , whether it be the drinking of beer , the eating of sweets , the smoking of tobacco , or the use of an automobile . In the realm of economics , any and all of these forms of self-satisfaction are legitimate grounds of expenditure , because , after satisfaction of the primary wants , they are a realization of the ultimate end of the effort to earn and accumulate . Prohibitionists , discussing the legalization of beverages with a substantial alcoholic content , speak as if the money spent for their purchase were sheer waste . This is nonsense , because , in the nature of things , waste and the satisfaction of human desire ? at least , within rational limits  --  are contradictory elements , each incompatible with the simultaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who consider money spent for alcoholic beverages as constituting the least profitable form of outlay , but , if we extend our , riew beyond the area of the United States , there can be no doubt that those who hold that opinion arc decidedly in the minority generally , if not in this country . It is at least debatable whether money spent for palatable , nutrient beer would not be as wisely spent as that given for thee products of the soda fountain or that laid out in the purchase of cigarettes . But , in any case , those who would prefer beer to sweets or cigarettes , or automobiles even , should not have their rights of choice interfered with by government on the paternalistic theory that , as in the case of a-lather and his children , it knows best what is good for them . If the nature and purpose be kept in mind of earning , in the first place , and of spending , in the second , that form of expenditure which matters not essentially wrong best satisfies the spender is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification . For some it is the things of the mind ; for others , those of the body . It is altogether a matter of taste . And a truly enlightened government , in the regulation of such affairs , would adopt as its principle of action that gem of wisdom of the ancients : De gustibus non est disputandum . J. DUNDON . New York , Aug. 29 , 1931 . THE TEACHER 'S LOT . It Would Seem to Be Anything but a Happy One These Days . To the Editor of The New York Times : How true , as Dr. Rice wrote in his letter to THE TIMES , that little seems to exude from child conferences but harmless platitudes , though I had never the courage to say it before . How true that it would be better to give the money spent in them to already established charities which do actual work for children . But is not that the curse of the day in this country ? We always think that we do more and better for a cause when we meet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something toward forwarding that millennium so often described but still so distant . But far more can I acclaim what he says about schools and teachers . The teachers , as I have been saying these many years , can not teach because they have not the time . The fad of the year is the principal thing , be it so-called health education , a new system of penmanship , or what-have-you ? You must attend to all the nonsense business , you must also teach all the elements present in a good academic education , but , if you can not do both , never , never abandon the latest fad , because that is what you are going to be judged by . Teachers have been required to make out in one afternoon a list , 3trictly alphabetized , of all the words.they intend teaching ( derived from several sources ) in the course ) f that term . The class was right there all afternoon . Did it get taught ? Or was it put at " busy work " ? Teachers have been told tty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ) n stating that such accomplishments were impossible , been told , " ' But it is just the impossible that ask of you ! " No sooner does a teacher learn the ins and outs of , say , a term 's work in physical training than she is put in charge of a differ ? . nt grade , and the next term the ** of study is materially altered . No regard is paid to the fact that t Is by practice that one learns a .. tertain technical skill in accomplishing tasks , and that by constantly altering the requirements , the " rules of the game , " the teacher is forever being pushed back into the position of a neophyte . And , besides , there is the requirement , ever more strictly enforced , of studying in paid courses all sorts of things after school hours . How can teachers , thus hounded week in , week out , being thrown out of place as nervous cases in increasing numbers , do real justice to the children ? MARY ERHARD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EXTRA INCOME LEVY . Governor 's Plan Would Work Hardship on at Least Two Classes . To the Editor of The Netp York Times : To help the unemployed , Governor Roosevelt suggests an additional 50 per cent tax on 1930 incomes to be paid at once : So , many now unemployed , wh last year held good positions , will be billed for a salary earned and expended long since . Months go slowly for the unemployed . Where am I , unemployed since April and with no job in sight , to find the additional $7.50 to pay on the $4,000 salary I earned last year ? Will part of my unwilling contribution to the unemployment fund be returned to me , also unemployed and as wholly dependent on my earning. , as any bread-liner ? If rumor and report are correct , there are many in the same plight a. ; I , who in 1930 earned good salaries , perhaps the largest of their working years , and who have this year earned nothing . Savings have had to go to keeping body and soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new opening . UNEMPLOYED TAXPAYER . Scarsdale , N. Y. , Aug. 28 , 1931 . A Non-Resident Viewpoint . To the Editor of The New York Times : Should the Legislature comply with Governor Roosevelt 's request to provide unemployment relief funds by levying a special tax of 50 per cent of the normal personal income tax , may we non-residents ask that it not apply to us ? To be sure we are employed in New York and pay an income tax in New York , which in itself seeras hardly fair , but we have our own unemployment problems in the States in which we live , and do not expect to shirk our duty there . However , why force the citizens of another State to help support the unemployed of New York State ? No one will fight any battles for us in the New York Legislature ? we non-resident income taxpayers have taxation without representation . Nevertheless , we in New Jersey will continue to spend millions on roads to be enjoyed free by New Yorkers coming by tunnel and bridge by the thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Montclair , N. J. , Aug. 29 , 1931 . Happiness at Small Cost . To the Editor of Tho New York Times : I am a letter carrier . People look at me each new morning , and I 'm sorry to have to say , " Sorry there 's nothing for you today . " I can easily see disappointment and sadness . Letters never written are never received . A postcard from one away brings untold happiness to a parent or one who cares . Thousands have died , broken hearted because their children were always too busy to write . Had they received mail they would live on merrily . When I was overseas with the A. E. F. , my mother sent me a letter that I just found in my army jacket . It reads in part , " Even when I feel I want to die , your wonderful letters make me want to live . " But for six months I received no mail at all ; all were too busy . My diary reminds me that my heart pained beyond words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the only time I was ever drunk in my life . A relative in Europe pleads in a letter to me : " Please tell me truthfully ! I know my son is dead , as he has n't written me in years . " The son is too busy to write his 80-yearold mother . I have two brothers , both attorneys , who have n't written ten letters to mother in twenty years . A 2-cent stamp will do what a million-dollar medicine will not . If only postoffices displayed signs ? " Write that letter home before it is too late ! " SIMON H. SCHNEIDER . Brooklyn , Aug. 30 , 1931 . The Perils of Popularity . To the Editor of The New York Times : While I have felt for some time that something should be done to stop the constant entertaining of our Mayor on the other side , reading your editorial on the subject this morning convinced me that I ought to protest , if it could be done nicely without hurting the feelings of his hosts , at the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to look at . Our worthy Mayor went over there because he was ill , all tired out and needed a rest , and it seems as though his physician , Dr. Schroedet , should have called a halt and given the Mayor a chance to take the cure and rest up for the strenuous duties that will be his lot on his return . It is all right to give him a good time , but they should think of his condition and what it will be when he gets home . FRANK B. MARTIN . Brooklyn , Aug. 29 , 1931 . Measure for Measure . To the Editor of The New York Times : In view of the preparations now in progress against the anticipated distress among New York City 's unemployed , might I suggest that the cit. ' , treasury would be in better condition to meet the situation if the salaries of some of our politician-executives and heads of departments were reduced to amounts more in keeping with the services rendered ?
