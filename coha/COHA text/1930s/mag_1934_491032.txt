THERE is a side street in Hollywood where nothing ever happens to entertain the neighbors  --  a dull , quiet , colorless street lined with green bungalows and lawns requiring water  --  and the people on that street never had any genuine fun until we moved into the small house on the corner and bought an automobile . After that , the residents always had something to look at , and a little of the drabness seemed to pass out of their lives . They used to stand on their front porches , looking over our way , giggling and making humorous remarks to one another . It was our first automobile , a sky-blue roadster , and we were as excited over it as a couple with a new , pink baby . There comes a spiritual exaltation with the first automobile that is never again wholly recaptured , no matter how many cars a person subsequently owns , no matter how much more splendid and expensive the later ones may be . That first car is the ear , in memory 's lane , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not know , but I hope it was with some nice family that treated it well . We  --  that is , Ellin and I  --  have bought and paid for many motor cars in the years gone by , and not one of the others brought us the joy that came with our first frail bluebird roadster , which , as I can now perceive , was little more than an animated tin can with a fretful disposil ion . Buying Cars and Going Places I T COST 8750 , spang new out of the shop window , and it was never a flawless mechanism , for in the early years , motor cars were vulnerable and some vital part was forever dropping on the highway . Today , the automobile is a perfected miracle and a joy forever , and you can drive across the country without a worry , but in those war days you expected a mechanical mishap every twelve miles and you got one every nine . The neighbors chuckled and pointed the finger of ridicule because we worried so openly over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one January , and the next day there began one of the longest and dampest wet spells in West Coast ? history . Old-timers still speak of it with bated breath . We were strangers , in a strange bungalow , with no garage , so we had to rent one from a neighbor  --  four dollars a month  --  and therein we housed the new pride and joy . Rain came down in bucketfuls , the roof leaked and drops splashed upon our new blue chariot , and wherever a drop Fell , the paint turned green . Those pioneer paint jobs were like that . On the second day , when we unlocked the garage , our automobile appeared to be coming down with old-fashioned Manchurian smallpox . We discovered that by polishing steadily between rains we could restore the blue paint ; so we rubbed in unison , Ellin and I , buying chamois skins and soft woolen rags ; the car standing before our home , the neighbors gawking . In due time we polished all the paint away and quit . That was the famous Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gaze back sentimentally . When we made this purchase , our total cash on hand was 0450 . We can instantly remember the numbers on our first license plates , and they will always linger with us . We have had shoals of plates since then and can recall none of them , not even the figures on the current machines . Being green motorists , we defied the conventions and operated without tools or extras on our first car  --  not even a spare tire  --  and drove happily and successfully about the countryside , sheltered from evil by beginner 's luck . Then came Car No. 2 , a rather solemn touring car , costing 51100 ; so , as you can see , we were already on the way up the financial ladder . This car acquainted us with the mysteries of side curtains , and we learned to play games with our side curtains in windy rainstorms . Like the blue roadster , the touring car came to us new , shining and unused , its floor covered with tan butcher 's paper . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , and of these , ten were used ears , or secondhand cars , or what the trade refers to as reconditioned machines . Seven were brand-new out of either factory or salesroom , smelling proudly of new paint . And every one of them has contributed definitely to the joy of being , enlarged our horizon and made our lives happier than they would have been . I regard our motor-car investment as the best we ever made . We have roared about the United States , having high adventure , landing in queer places and meeting queer people , and now our California plates attract no attention in the effete East . Once upon a time there was a standard observation , and we had it From man , woman and child : " Well , you 're a long ways from home , ai n't you ? " 17 Problem for the Best Electrical Minds IIE highest price we ever paid for a car was 53900 , 1 and were we proud of that one ! It was a sea-green sedan with soft , luxurious seats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded down with do-jiggers and attachments and added parts . including extra lights here and there . On the radiator was a lamp with red and green eyes . I was extremely proud of my lights , but they required wires , and when you lifted the hood and glanced in , you beheld almost a national network . The first year everything went swimmingly , but after that came trouble . If I happened to be rolling along at forty miles and was forced suddenly to apply the brakes , all my lights went out and stayed out . Nobody knew why . The best electrical minds in California puzzled over my lights . Mechanics removed the wires and put them back , all clean and shipshape , and the lights continued to go out at embarrassing moments . By mere chance I discovered what to do on a dark night . You took a screw driver , reached down as far as possible and poked blindly around under the dashboard , and after a while you would hear something click and the lights would flash on as brilliantly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent four years poking with a screw driver in the pitchy dark and swearing softly . California has always been proud of its lovely roads , and they were good in the early days of our motoring , so we drove aimlessly and contentedly about the state . To he sure , some of the highways were waiting for the hand of advance , and the first ( Continued on Paga 70 ) ( Continued from Page 67 ) My mother had a theory that princesses must marry young . " When they are over twenty , " she would declare , " they begin to think too much and to have too many ideas of their own which complicate matters . Besides , an unmarried princess has no position at . all . Princesses must marry . " And when mama said " must , " she meant it . I am not going to enumerate our admirers or suitors . Anyhow , mama 's theories gave her no difficulties ; in those days there seemed to be no end of young princes looking for wives , and I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing about this as our clever parent knew her daughters well enough to surround whatever plan she had with sufficient romance to make it attractive , for we were at a sentimental age and none of us would have accepted with open eyes a metaled mariage de raison . At an early age we were , therefore , taken about  --  at a too-early age , I think , because our appearance on the scene disturbed the plans of other royal mothers who disapproved of daughters being brought out so soon . Besides , we were in no hurry to grow up and did not at all like being thrust into the company of older cousins who resented our untimely intrusion into the world when , according to them  --  and quite rightly  --  we should still have been in the schoolroom . But the young princes seemed to be of another opinion , and before I was sixteen more than one gave me to understand that I was entirely to his taste . Into the Marriage Market No names need be mentioned , but as this is the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a period when my heart . was touched by two suitors of the same name bet belonging to far different earners of Europe , and I knew many a pang because each , in his own way , let me feel that it was in my power to make him either happy or miserable  --  for they , too , were young . I did not want to make anyone miserable , but the heart is such a troublesome organ and at that early age anything definite seemed so far off . Besides , one could not make up one 's mind all by oneself . I am aware that this way of looking at things does not fit into the ideas of today , when young people have taken so much into their own hands , when they are almost wiser and certainly more advanced than their parents , and when their knowledge of facts is complete . We were brought up in a fool 's paradise , carefully guarded from reality ; our world was delusion , and our mother was horrified if anyone dared to lift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this painted veil that those who live call life . " Yet Life was knocking at the door . Ever more insistent was its knock , and with it came that unrest , chief characteristic of awakening youth . But . if marriage was in our thoughts , it ems only time we started to motor from Los Angeles to San Francisco , we were not out after speed records . We merely hoped we would get there . The other day we flipped it off in twelve hours , but when we had our sainted blue roadster it took six days , not counting the time spent sitting on boxes in wayside as a distant goal ; all roads finally pointed that way , but it was a long , long way off . So when we were brought together with princes who , according to our mother 's ideas , were acceptable , we were quite at our ease , enjoying their company and their attention without worrying our heads much about their intentions . The sentimental visions they evoked were vague and unprecise . But the song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks and allusions as well as whispered words that might have meant more than they actually said and which I hugged . to my soul , repeating them over and over again ; they made my heart flutter , for all was romance in those days , mystery and discovery  --  but strange as it may seem to the girls of today , none of my flirtations ever went as far as a kiss . This , perhaps , was because I was so young . So many voices seemed pressing in upon one , so many eyes had messages , and one never doubted . the truth or importance of any word of love . Sister Ducky was more austere , more unbending than I was . She was always the monitor ; the one who would tolerate no nonsense , who admonished or cautioned . Her advice or reproof was listened to , and there was a steel-like rectitude about her which commanded respect . I remember an exceedingly funny little episode in which Dueky stands out clearly in her mentor 's attitude . Our Rosenau gardener had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; being painfully shy , there was something awkward , even ungainly about . his movements , but he was decidedly good-looking , though his excessive timidity made him seem sulky . Wordless and constrained , he had , nevertheless , through the mysterious telepathy of youth , made me understand that in spite of his being nothing but the gardener 's nephew and I a blond little princess , his heart was aching with love for me . It must have been his eyes which made me understand this , for it was certainly not his tongue . Ducky , forever on the alert , had discovered this little byplay and was half sympathetic and half contemptuous , but the boy 's exceeding timidity had something touching about it  --  in addition to which , he was so perfectly harmless . Finally I confessed to this critical sister that I wanted to give some little keepsake to the languorous-eyed youth ; for Eve-like , his evident admiration had not left me unmoved . Ducky was gracious , and putting our heads together it was finally decided that , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him something . But what ? Ali , a good idea . Easter being near , I must paint him something for Easter ; it would make the gift more plausible . After much reflection we decided that I should paint on an ostrich 's egg . I happened to possess just such an object , globular , thick and polished like ivory , mellow of tint , smooth to the touch ; and on tins pleasant surface , ( Continued from Page 14 ) garages . Where the road was poor , I used to bump along gingerly , staring at the large cars that seemed to float by us . Now the highway laughs along up the coast , two , three and four panels wide , and you can skim like a breeze , but when we began with the bluebird , the road was plain mud hero and there , JanaarY 13.1914 with much care and love , I painted little bouquets of mauve pansies . How well I can still see those mauve Pansies i ! The egg being round . and slippery it was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smudge my flowers whilst painting . To complete this artistic treasure , two holes had , with excruciating anxiety , been bored at the top and at the bottom of the egg , so as to be able to pass a ribbon through it from which it could be suspended , The ribbon was mauve , matching the flowers . Dueky took as much interest as I did in the creation of this Easter offering , and finally a propitious day was fixed upon which the gift was to be offered . A Pastoral Interlude Although in the same class with Alfred 's friends , being the gardener 's nephew , he was not  --  for these were predemocrat.ie days  --  amongst those invited to our parties , and could only be encountered in the large Rosenau kitchen garden on high days and holidays when he visited his Uncle Terks , the royal head gardener . Terks was tall , dark and taciturn ; he grew wonderful flowers , but it was not his smile which made them bloom . Terks never smiled . We were rather in awe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both parties divined that Terks would have no sympathy with his nephew 's sentimentalities . Ducky , well aware that two is company and three is none , decided not to preside over the actual offering of the precious Easter egg , but to walk about amongst the flowers , close enough at hand to be able to interrupt the tate-1-tete when she considered it had lasted sufficiently , for neither she nor I was quite comfortable about this interview over which the Herr Obergartner Tern 's frown hung like a threat . The young man accepted my gift with the shame-faced timidity which was to be expected of him ; his eyes indeed were eloquent , but his attitude sheepish and even tinged with resentfulness . For all that , his hands received the frail offering with that special tenderness characteristic of the strong and artless . Few words were exchanged , but I felt a certain elation in the silent scene ; then , full of dignity , Ducky sailed down upon us through the flowers like a black swan out to protect her brood . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not very long after this sentimental episode I returned home , after a short absence , engaged to a prince from a foreign country . From that day onwards , the gardener 's nephew no more saluted me , and when lie met me he would turn his head another way so as not to have to take off his hat . I wonder how long he kept the Easter egg . Editor 's Note  --  This is the firth or a aeries of articles by Marie , Queen of Rumania . The next Will appear in an early Save . and then one-panel pavement , which is the sort where you miss the other man 's left fender by seven inches at forty miles per hour . Ellin and I have been around the world fourteen times at the equator , or some 340,000 miles , sitting in our used and new cars , and to this day , she believes I am an unreliable and feather-headed driver . She swears that I drive far too fast and will eventually be hauled out from under the wreckage , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur , taking nary a chance . Ellin 's memory is excellent and she avers that the seventeen motor cars cost us a grand total of $24,225 , in the following order : $750 , $1100 , $1600 , $1200 , $1500 , $350 , $1200 , $1300 , $3900 , $1600 , S1100 , $1600 , $2100 , $600 , $575 , $1950 and $1500 . You will observe the presence of the $350 item , which constituted a. special event in our motor career . It was , as one might suspect , a used car of a make that has long since faded into the shadows , and it was used to the point of complete , utter and total exhaustion . I never intended to buy it , having gone down town to purchase a four-cylinder , new and unused , from a firm of good repute and long standing in the community . Passing innocently inside , I encountered what was called then a high-powered salesman , or perhaps it was " high-pressure , " meaning a. gifted fellow who could sell you something you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and led me to a used bargain , technically known as a " snap " or ' ' give-away . " The price was $350 . As I had intended to pay much more , I fell an easy prey to the loathsome fellow . We did not actually drive home in the $350 beauty . We drove eleven blocks , at which point the machine began to disassemble itself on the car tracks . Pieces of iron fell off , making a clanging noise . The engine appeared to break into four equal parts , gears came out of mesh , the steering wheel trembled , the car stopped and Ellin and I stepped out to look . It was a perfectly dead ear and would never be alive again , so the garageman informed us , concealing a smile . It . was finally towed out to our residence and left at the curb , a sad sight , a testament to my verdancy , and I notified the firm that hired the high-power salesman . The firm said it was my funeral . I thereupon arranged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red , white and blue , meaning to lean this sign against the car , which remained at the curb , giving the passing public a few trenchant facts about buying automobiles . This caused the firm to come out to my house , remove the pulseless automobile , write up a new contract and deliver to me a new car that would go . Money Makes the Motor Go Never in all these years have I actually purchased a motor car for hard cash , and 1 have always wished for the day to come when I would be able to lay the money on the line , take my motor car home and evade interest . My interest payments , called carrying charges , have pushed me back about $3000 during the seventeen years , or four fair ears . We have burned up 27,500 gallons of gasoline , costing the firm about $4000 , and we have paid for 200 tires , new , medium and retreads , bringing the cost of our motoring up to , roughly , $31,225 , not including tires . After including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and garage bills , the grand total would be about 35,000 iron men , and it might even be 40,000 , as I never kept books , except for a brief spell during a fit of economy . And that is one $40,000 I shall always regard with a kindly eye , for Ellin and I have had our money 's worth over and over again . I have made a few sour deals , but the average was fair . For example , we are a couple of people who make a definite point of keeping away from doctors . We do not like doctors in our family , so when we fall ill with the flu or a sore throat or the autumn bilious attack , instead of having the medico , we climb into our car and ride  --  we ride for hours and hours and hours . The sun and the breeze and the car moving  --  these are our pills , and even if the idea is illogical , it works , and we are both in grand shape  --  knock wood  --  and hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil on the neck . During the big flu epidemic of 1915 , I drove thousands of miles , wondering what was the matter and would I live or die . I have rolled away violent attacks of indigestion , fits of the blues caused by a faltering liver , and pains down the spinal column , just sitting there behind the wheel and skittering up and down the state of California . I do not claim this method would guarantee health in all families , but we have proved it and will have no other . A Non  --  Accident Record I have been arrested , ticketed and summoned into court three times , which is a creditable record . Once a sour-minded officer hauled me in for speeding ? just once in seventeen years  --  and twice I blundered through the red signal . Ellin has never been arrested or fined or haled into court . and is correspondingly snooty , having driven almost as many miles as I have . This probably sounds like an untruth , but some of the other facts in our motoring career are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been involved in a motor-car accident  --  any kind , unless you count . the merest trifles . Once a man ran into my rear hub cap , denting it so faintly I could scarcely find the nick . I gently bumped into a telephone pole , bending the front fender , and once a hurrying scoundrel crumpled a forward fender while rushing past me in Cleveland , Ohio . And that 's all  --  the right hand lifted . I know dozens and dozens of people who have been in the most atrocious accidents  --  head-on collisions at forty-five miles , over cliffs and into rivers , and , bang , into freight trains , street cars and ten-wheeler trucks  --  and so I am a bit proud , and regard myself as one of the seven best automobile drivers in America today . This view is not shared by Ellin , who declares I make her nervous and will some day be carried home on a shutter through reckless disregard for the laws of safety . It is a moot question in our family , with Ellin usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own concerning other motorists and pedestrians , based upon many years of close and profane observation . I go forward in my motor car on the assumption that everyone else on the road , afoot or in car , is a lunatic out for the afternoon without guards . I do not depend upon boulevard stop signs , or red signals flashing , or the waving of a human hand , or gestures conveying questionable information . My intent is to avoid all contact with other motor cars and stand ready to dodge . If I have the right of way , I unhesitatingly surrender it to the other fellow , I F von have a cold  --  do n't take chances with " cold killers " and nostrums . A EVENING POST for I have been in hospitals to visit friends who had the right of way and can prove it through their bandages . I assume that a man driving out of a side street will run into me if he can possibly do so , that a lady signaling a left turn will naturally make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curbstone is simply waiting there to commit suicide by jumping under my front wheels . I do not enjoy talking with truck drivers  --  usually stout fellows with a wallop  --  and the way to avoid talking with truck drivers is to let them have both sides of the road , and your hat if they want it . This might seem to be an extreme way of looking at traffic , but you would be surprised at how many things you do not bit in a year 's cruising . The pedestrian who burns me up to a cinder , and must irritate other motorists , is the haughty , aloof or dumb  --  I never knew which  --  the haughty , aloof or dumb individual , male or female , who strolls across the street directly in your path and never deigns to turn his head and look at you . This type of submerged intellect deliberately places his life in the hands of the motorist , who may or may not be warmed with wine , saying : " My life , as you see , is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kill me if you so desire , as I am in no way interested . " It became apparent , as we grew older and wiser in motoring , that anyone was likely to meet with a serious accident , that no skill or care could prevent some types of smash-up , and that probably the worst form is the straight head-on collision at forty or fifty miles . There is a young man who hangs around our house and tells people he is our son , and he disagrees violently with Ellin and me , and rattles here and there in a roadster of well-known make , small , but weighted down with sixty-seven extras , beginning with a radio under the cowl and ending with a red devil on his radiator . He has been arrested four times for speeding to school , double-crossing Shakspere , and is not regarded as a regular member of our family , as he likewise has figured in collisions and minor accidents requiring insurance adjustments . Insurance for Assurance There we have another knotty problem  --  automobile insurance , the premiums on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen years , and I have never collected any large sum from the insurance gentlemen . That seems unfair somehow . I feel that they should hand me a bonus , after my loyalty and all those payments . We now operate three cars in our outfit  --  if you count Henry 's little buzzard with the red devil  --  and we have fire , theft and liability insurance on all three . Thus , if Henry , Ellin or I should happen to smack some stranger and he sued for S50,000 for a broken collar bone , I would not have to pay a thin dime . The sad feature is we have never smacked anybody . No car of ours ever burned up , or even started to singe about the edges . No car was ever stolen , and that makes me melancholy , when I think of all the money I have checked out , wholly , as it now appears , to obtain peace of mind . In our early days of motoring , we invariably bought and drove open cars and looked upon sedans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first nine cars were all of the wide-open or Januar-Y 15,1034 double-pneumonia , type , but as time wore on closed-ear Nature asserted itself , and we became and so Will remain to the end . A poignant memory of the past is sitting down on a leather seat that has been dallying with the California sun , cooking myself as far north as the third rib ; and from now on , I would like to have my seats cold . I once defeated the hot sun by buying a pneumatic rubber ring , used by invalids , and placing that on the seat , and then sitting on it . This system proved faulty , as it causes paralysis of both legs . Carburetor Specialist So intense was my interest in automobiles that I became a sort of gentleman mechanic and took great pride in my knowledge of engines , carburetors , distributor heads , gear boxes , differentials and torque . It is true that I was at best an inept and faltering mechanic , and any real job stopped me cold . Among friends , I acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a man who purchases used ears is supposed to understand engines and recognize the sound made by a sticking valve . Acquaintances asked for advice , and I gave it freely , and probably with a touch of hauteur . I actually told simpleminded friends which cars to purchase and which to scorn , how much to pay and whether the engine had years of service or was worn out . They believed me . " This car , " I would say , pointing at one the man was about to buy , " will give you 40,000 miles and no trouble , " or " Do n't think of buying that one , as the motor needs reboring , the drive line is loose , the battery is exhausted and dissolution is at hand . " When I contemplate the past , I can easily see what a fraud I was , but at the time I believed I was an expert , and the car that made an expert out of me was our fourth , a heavy roadster . This baby was the real black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , with its bright yellow and green paint , but it had the soul of a Malay dock-walloper and would lie down at the most inopportune times . It was , of course , a used car , with enormous tires that were always going flat , and a trick carburetor , consisting of a cylindrical body with a barrel sliding up and down inside and squirting a needle spray of gasoline  --  that is , when it was in a good humor . This car , when purchased , had no drip or mud pan under the engine , and in rainy weather the mud splashed upward . Bits of gravel flew from the road and lodged between the sliding barrel and the cylinder walls , whereupon the barrel stuck , and from then on the engine ran at seventy miles an hour  --  either that , or it stopped completely . The first rainy day after we owned the black sheep the engine died , and as I was in utter ignorance , a garage mechanic discovered the carburetor de-feet , took the fool thing apart , cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so poor at the time that I could n't afford a new carburetor , for wo owned the car for two years and suffered the whole time from gravel trouble . The carburetor had twelve or thirteen parts  --  six screws , three small nuts , two bolts and a plunger  --  and every time it rained , it cost me one dollar . From incessant watching , I learned how to do it , and became a mechanic . Presently I was taking the accursed thing apart myself , usually in a clown-pour , with Ellin holding an electric torch on the job , lest I get the fan mixed up with the spark plugs . I suppose I must have taken down and put back that faulty mechanism in fourteen or fifteen states and in some of the hardest rainstorms . Another &Teatririty; about this car was that every time you made a left turn , the horn blew . I never knew why . People watching me make a left turn would often stare at me curiously , never suspecting that I had nothing whatever to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic , 1 gradually spread out and could eventually take an engine almost down , but could never quite put it bark in the original formation . I enjoyed removing the hood and tinkering with the insides , and that thought saddens me these days , for now I never look at my engine , never lift the hood , never polish the ear . I must . be getting soft and oldish . I would n't personally wash my car today , if it never was washed , and yet . there was a time when I dearly loved to take a good garden hose , plenty of rags , and scrub the touring car until it gleamed in the sunshine , catching in the process a fairly permanent cold . Carbon in the motor was a constant annoyance , and nobody knew exactly what to do about carbon . Gasoline today must be very wonderful stuff indeed , for we never seem to have carbon trouble now ; but those old engines used to carbon up , cough , gasp , stick and quit . It was my custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than pay the garage hands one dollar and fifty cents , which was the standard charge . I learned how to run kerosene  --  plain coal oil of another era  --  through my engine , the theory being that kerosene removed carbon and shot it out through the exhaust pipe . I realize now that this was a faulty scientific theorem . All that actually happens is that the kerosene comes out through the pipe in a furious black cloud , and on Sunday mornings our rather nice neighborhood in Hollywood looked like an oil-well fire , with the neighbors wondering what to do about me and my mechanics . Those Thirty Miles In due time , I purchased paints and brushes and refurbished the bodies of cars when they became shabby or sick from the California sunshine , but the results were never exactly happy , and I know now that I shall never he a truly good motor-car painter . I always worked in a splotchy effect that disturbed the eye . Today , they put paint on motor cars with a gun , and it remains beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck soup for that California sun . The fastest speed at which I have ever driven was seventy-eight miles an hour , maintained for two miles between Salinas and King City , a stretch where there are no traffic officers , with Elfin worrying on the seat beside me and asking what would I do if a front tire blew out . The longest period I ever drove was eighteen hours without . stopping , except for gas , oil , and sardine sandwiches . I was never stuck in a ditch and was never held up and robbed . Though naturally a person with a kindly disposition , I steadily refuse to give hitch-hikers a ride , no matter how sail their countenances or stiff the protruding thumb . I regtird all hitchhikers as potential murderers , which is probably an injustice , but many of my friends  --  kindly ones  --  have felt the toueli of a gun against the ribs , and so my faith in hikers was long ago destroyed . The worst road we ever encountered was a thirty-mile stretch between Saugus and Camarillo , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible road by accident . Ellin driving . She turned of the main highway while I was looking under the floor boards for a knock ; and when I discovered we were on the wrong road , I spoke to her rather bitterly and refused to let her turn around and go back . I said : " Now that you have got us into this , we will go ahead if it kills us . " We nearly lost our automobile that day  --  a new one , the apple of our eye . The road was so rutty that we took turns driving in low gear , and the one not driving climbed out and walked beside the struggling fenders . The engine smoked , smelled , steamed and threatened to catch fire and explode ; the body groaned . We came out of it alive , but Ellin has always claimed that I acted like an obstinate chump , and maybe so . Helping the Farmers , et Al The only thing I really fear as a motorist , and always have feared , is the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a eat  --  I mean I could bear up under it , although I would not deliberately seek out a eat and go for it . But the mere thought of running down a dog gives me the willies . I do not fear running down a human , for I have never considered such a thing possible . Ellin , on the other hand , is afraid of nothing but a mountain road with a ravine on one side , a sheer drop off into space . That is her weakness , and many a time she has excused herself , asked me to stop the car , and stepped out for a walk up or down the mountain . She is made slightly nervous by wet pave-merits , and spends her time talking to me if I am driving in the rain . Concerning motor cars generally , I have learned one important fact that seems beyond any question or challenge , and it is this : When you purchase your fine , new car  --  and today , they are all lovely , durable things  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be proud , be it a 5600 machine , or a 56000 one , treat it reasonably with the lubricating oil . Pour new oil in the crank ease every 1000 miles from the day of purchase , and give the engine a drink of valve oil every now and then , for sometimes the valves are treated like orphans ; pour water in the radiator and water in the battery and smack a dab of oil on the springs . There has been scarcely a month during all these years when I have not been paying for a machine . The lowest monthly payment was fifty dollars , which I suppose is rock bottom , and the highest was $225 every thirty days . That $225 hit me every month for a year and caused much home moaning and remorse . Last year-1032 ? things happened to be a bit dull in my line , business was not . singing any merry roundelays and everyone was saying that if everyone would only step forth and buy something , the wheels of commerce would commence to hum . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he done . My car  --  the one I drive mostly  --  was three years old , a little shabby , and Ellin 's was six and at a stage where nothing more could be expected . The engine rattled and groaned and the gears meshed badly , and full speed with the throttle open was about thirty miles an hour  --  the ear that once thought nothing of seventy-five . I determined to be a patriotic citizen , help the farmers and business men and provide locomotion for the family for many years to come , and despite the fact that I saw no way of paying for them . I walked up to the counter and bought : Sedan $1950 1 Sedan These are stout and elegant automobiles and ought to roll 100,000 miles each before even being overhauled . They are both paid for after great sacrifices and skimpings , mostly on clothes . Ellin is the queer sort of woman who would rather have a good motor car than garments for the female person , and I find that old clothes make very little difference in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever got out of a ear was 74,000 , but my two sedans are going to make that record look sick . There was a haughty time in our affairs when neither of us would think of going about in a dusty , soiled-looking machine . We demanded neatness and gleaming hoods , glistening radiators and spotless wheels , but we have changed our views . We found this : When you drive around town in a speckless and gleaming car , passing from grocer to butcher to bank and post office , all the town panhandlers look you over and swarm in . You appear to be rich and prosperous , and the moochers make life miserable . But if your machine is a mite disreputable. they decide you are poor and leave you alone . This may be a cowardly attitude , but you do not know our town and the panhandlers thereof . At first , we were a one-car family , just Elfin and I and the young squirt growing up , and we considered ourselves vastly fortunate to own one motor car . Came the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car standing out at night , as we had only one garage , Now we are a three-car outfit , the son having joined us , and one car still stands out in the dew , for the son is usually building a boat in his end of the garage . He has been building it for three years , and it is now so large it can not be moved . The Road Hog , Explained We keep no records , so we do not know actual costs of anything . Once I had a neat , red book and marked down every penny spent for oil , gasoline . tires and repairs , and the ambition of my life was to get fifteen miles to the gallon . Now I do not care , and listen to the boastings of others without a pang of envy . I still swear violently at passing motorists who go by like lightning , knocking . bits of paint off the front fender , but I have long passed the stage where I moo with them . There was a period when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as an inferiority complex which should be combated . Many of the motorists who rush by other machines are the sad victims of an inferiority urge and deserve sympathy . They realize they are pretty poor specimens of the human race , and do not compare well with their fellows , are not witty , or brilliant or charming or handsome ; can not build a good mouse trap , do card tricks , shine socially , play a piano or make a speech . Their only chance to indicate superiority is to pass another motor car going up a hill , and thus they should be forgiven for dashing by and rutting in . A friend of mine , normally a calm man , was recently enraged by a passing lunatic , who shoved him over into the soft shoulder and cut by , nearly shaving of a fender . Giving way to futile rage , my friend swore a loud oath , got under full headway and rammed the passer-by , now going peacefully down the road . He smashed the man 's tank , it caught fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry you may be with the road hogs , do not ram them from the rear . Nature will attend to them . Every year or two , Ellin and I return to our old home town to visit the relatives , and there is something mournful about those visits . It is the car . As a child , I recall the distances , and they were enormous and conquered either on foot or behind old Brownie , the ancient horse . We owned a farm with tenants , and every so often we drove out to the farm to inspect wheat and discuss rent money . Fourteen miles , it was , which meant that those going arose with the dawn , ate a hearty breakfast , piled into the buggy and set forth on a long journey through the sandy roads . Join Airplane Next ? It required all forenoon to get there . Sometimes we remained overnight , sleeping in the attic , gathering strength for the arduous return . When Ellin and I hit the old home town in our first car , distances had diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old farm , " I suggested , and we did so , fourteen miles in less than no time . The town had shriveled up . No more sandy roads , no trees with waving branches and no wide fields of wheat and corn , but only a series of neat streets , neat homes , each with its garage , and the old farm a real-estate subdivision . We now remain away from the home town until driven there by feelings of shame . We continue to reside in California , where motor cars are vastly useful , but I must confess in sadness that they no longer open the door to romance and adventure , The roads once were rough and detours were everywhere , springing at you unexpectedly , challenging your courage . Our little blue roadster meant adventure and exploits , but now the land is commonplace , the mountains seem to have flattened out , hills are no longer hills ; there is no such thing as mud . Cars roll along forever , the engines getting sweeter as time passes . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lulls , looking for a lost gold mine . Ellin and I used to arise at five in the morning , hop into the car and ride joyously in the morning air , for the sheer excitement and fun of riding . No more , I still love to drive an automobile , and will never weary of it , but the fine , wild excitement is gone , b'gosh . Maybe we ought to buy an airplane . We are not so frightfully young , but neither are we old , and I will wager that we can learn to drive a plane , as we once learned to drive the bluebird , and set it down neatly on three-point landings as well as the man with the air mail . That may be our next step  --  a steady and reliable plane , three or four good engines , with me doing the driving and Ellin in the back seat , urging me to go slow around that aloud ahead , lest we blow a front tire .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
