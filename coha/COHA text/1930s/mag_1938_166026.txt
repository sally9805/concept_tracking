Almost unnoticed , while the world watched Neville Chamberlain come home from having a dish of tea with Adolf Hitler ( see p. 15 ) , the Prime Minister 's half sister-in-law Lady Chamberlain came home last week from having dishes and dishes of tea with Seora Carmen Franco and the Rightist Generalissimo . She was instantly denounced by Leftists of all shades . <P> Famed " Lady C. " , whose husband , Sir Austen Chamberlain , was one of the best friends the League of Nations ever had , visited Rome last winter . There she hobnobbed with League-bolting Il Duce and was credited by diplomats with having done much to smooth the way for the Anglo-Italian Treaty of Friendship which was presently signed , but has never become operative . Reason : By a covering agreement this treaty can not come into force until substantial numbers of Italian troops have been withdrawn from Spain . Thus last week there was good reason to think Lady C. has just spent a quiet month in Rightist Spain mainly to give Generalissimo Franco some idea of how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a few thousand Italians could conveniently be sent home . <P> Lady C. in London last week disclaimed political activity , remarked that , as chairman of the General Relief Fund for Distressed Spanish Women and Children ( both Leftists and Rightists ) , it was natural enough for her to go to Spain . " I was favorably impressed , " said she , " with conditions in the districts I visited . " Retorted the Leftist spokesman of the Spanish Embassy in London : " If she is as interested in Government Spain as in Franco Spain , why did n't she include Government Spain in her tour ? " Admitting that she was receiving hundreds of letters from irate Leftists , the conservative Prime Minister 's sister-in-law explained unperturbed , " In our Barcelona canteen we are feeding 4,000 people every day . Our fund is expending 312 pounds ( $1,500 ) per month on each side in Spain . "
