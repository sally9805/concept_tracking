But Belasco Was Also a Dramatist and Discoverer of Stars . More , than anything else David Belasco , " the wizard of the American theatre , " was known for his application to the art of stagecraft . He wrote and produced more than 200 plays , many of them great successes , and he developed and managed a long line of stars from Mrs. Leslie Carter to Lenore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with sets and lighting effects . His attention to detail , to the bit that other producers were content to gloss over , contributed the term " Belasco atmosphere " to the dramatic critic 's vocabulary . Belasco 's adventures in the theatre spanned a half-century . When he first came to New York the theatrical district was centred in the Tenderloin segment of Broadway . His lifetime saw American drama evolve away from the melodrama of the 1880 's to a flowering in more subtle forms . Yet Belasco , who made his first great successes with melodrama , loved that form of stage entertainment to the last , and , with Willard Mack to write them for him , he acchieved several successes late in his career . Like Sir Arthur Wing Pinero , Belasco was of Portuguese origin . His ancestors were forced to quit their homeland when the Moors swarmed into it . They sought a haven in England , whence the immediate forebears of David set out for Vancouver , B. C. In Vancouver the father of the future " dean of the American theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Humphrey Abraham Belasco , have it that he was once elected Mayor of Vancouver and that he was for a time ' quite well-to-do . Reverses came , however , and the harlequin moved southward to San Francisco in 1852 . This move was made at the height of the gold-rush fever , and it was in the glittering , sprawling and lively San Francisco of those days that the producer was born on July 25 , 1854 . He first saw the light of day in a cellar . Acted Little Duke of York at 11 . Very early in life he showed a fondness for the theatre . When his father moved to Victoria , B. C. , David played juvenile parts in the Victoria Theatre . When Charles Kean came to town to produce " King Richard III . " 11-year-old David filled the role of the little Duke of York . He even wrote a play , " Jim Black , or the Regulator 's Revenge , " not long after the family had again moved to San Francisco . His next play , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some forgotten date " soon after the death of Lincoln . " Before his family left Canada for the second time David spent several years in a Roman Catholic monastery on Vancouver Island . He is said to have left the monastery when a circus played near by ; and it was a reported boast of Belasco 's that he was the first boy ever to jump through a hoop of fire on horseback . His formal schooling was continued in San Francisco until 1871 . Always energetic , the young David studied elocution orr the side and did such odd jobs as he could get . Late in life he was fond of remembering when he sold papers and scrubbed the floor of a cigar store . When he left school after 1871 he : . carted eight years of what William Winter described in his biography of Belasco as " nomadic bohemianism . " He roamed the San Francisco streets at night ; recited melodramtic verses or " shockers " of his own composition in low dives ; and investigated the worst " and most sensational quarters and happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ ' ater in writing melodramas for the Pacific Coast theatre . Belasco 's biographer , Mr. Winter , found it impossible to supply a chronological account of the producer 's early life , for much valuable information was destroyed in the . San Francisco fire of 1906 , and Belasco himself could not revolve his memcries and impressions into sequence . Yet the " wizard " told Mr. Winter of more than 200 parts played in the San Francisco theatre following his first job as a call boy at the Metropolitan Playhouse . Among the roles he played were Hamlet , Marc Antony , Uncle Tom , Louis XI , Fagin and ' Armand . Duval . Became Stage Manager at Nineteen . At the age of nineteen he became stage manager of the Baldwin Theatre in San Francisco ; and he held the same position successively at the Grand Opera House and the Metropolitan , where he had started out as call boy . It was during this period that he met such men and women of the theatre as Edwin Booth , John McCullough , E. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His spare time in the ' seventies was spent in . dramatizing novels , adapting foreign plays and doing some original work . Besides acting in his own plays he toured with Sothern in the " Lord Dundreary " Company , appearing as the valet . After his San Francisco days , Belasco moved to Virginia City , then the centre of the turbulent ' Comstock lode " mining district . He met Dion Boucicault , the Irish dramatist and stagecraft adept , and served him for a time as Private secretary . While he was in Virginia City , playing for John W. Mackay , James G. Fair and others who became wealthy through the mines , his ability had become known as far . east as New York , for " La Belle Russe , " which he wrote in 1879 , had achieved a success at Wallack 's Theatre . In 1882 he was induced to try New York , and so joined the Mallory brothers as stage manager and stock dramatist at their Madison Square Theatre . Here his play " May Blossom " was produced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had reached New York he became associated with Daniel Frohman , serving as his stage manager at the Old Lyceum . Here were produced three plays he wrote in collaboration with the late Henry C. De Mille . " The Wife " ( 1887 ) , " Lord Chumley " ( 1888 ) , " The Charity Ball " ( 1889 ) and " Men and Women " at Proctor 's Twenty-third Street Theatre ( 1890 ) . " The Girl I Left Behind Me , " with the late Franklyn Fyles as collaborator , was produced at the Empire Theatre in 1893 .. The comedy " Lord Chumley " started E. H  --  Sothern on his career . Belasco collaborated with John Luther Long in " Madame Butterfly " and " The Darling of the Gods , " and it was in the latter drama that Blanche Bates became famous . It was Belasco 's production of Charles Klein 's " The Music Master " which brought David Warfield into the front rank of stars . Two vehicles for Miss Bates ? " The Girl of the Golden West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other successes he wrote unaided ; as were " The Grand Army Man " and " The Return of Peter Grimm " ? two starring vehicles for Mr. Warfield . Brought Mrs. Leslie Carter to Stage . The " great adventure " of his early years in New York was bringing Mrs. Leslie Carter to the stage . She had been prominent socially , and had gained much unwelcome publicity , most of which she believed to be unfair , when her husband had divorced her . She came to Belasco with her story , and " her face , " as the producer said , " expressed every shade of the emotion in her heart . " Prejudice was strong against Mrs. Carter , and Belasco had trouble getting a stage for her , but he succeeded . She first appeared in " The Ugly Duckling " and later she starred for him in many triumphs , including " The Heart of Maryland , " " Zaza " and others . In 1906 Mrs. Carter ran away and married Lou Payne . This caused an estrangement between her and Belasco. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not until recently that they made up their quarrel . It was reported then that Mrs. Carter would be seen soon on the New York stage in an adaptation from the German which Belasco planned to produce . But he denied this . In his later career he adapted " Kaki , " in which Lenore Ulric. starred . After the World War he produced mainly the work of other dramatists , from the " Lulu Belle " of Edward Sheldon and Charles to " The Merchant of Venice , " in which David Warfield played the role of Shylock . Among his latest productions were " The Bachelor Father . " which ran for a season ; last year 's comedy " It 's a Wise Child , " which also was good for a season 's run , and " Tonight or Never , " which now is running at the Belasco Theatre . It was during a try-out engagement of the last named play in Baltimore that Mr. Belasco was stricken with pneumonia , and the opening night of the play in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed in fifty years . His illness would not permit him to attend . In 1902 Belasco acquired his own theatre . It was , appropriately enough , the Belasco , situated on Forty-fourth Street , near Broadway . Six years were spent in a legal fight with Klaw and Erlanger and other theatrical syndicate managers ; and his fight for independence as a producer is said to have cost Belasco almost a million dollars . - In the early years of this century Belasco rode many hobbies . He was a stickler for actuality in his props . and if an actor were to appear as coming on stage from a stairway , Belasco built the stairway complete , regardless of whether the spectators could see it . He believed that a complete stairway helped the actor to get the spirit of his entrance . In " The Return of Peter Grimm " there was supposedly a horticultural garden off stage ; Belasco placed bundles of real fruit trees and bulbs in the marked spot . Although no one out front could read them , he had tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dutch to please an old Dutch professor whom he called in to identify each plant . In his " Concert , " the letters that were used were genuine copies of Mozart and other famous composers , although no one in the audience would have known if they had been those of a piano tuner : Eventually Mr. BelasWowned interests in theatres of most of the principal cities . At his studio over the Belasco Theatre , on Forty-fourth Street , he maintained for a time a bureau of playwriting to - which thousands sent manuscripts . He said he spent $20,000 a year on this bureau , and all to no effect , as , in the end , he said , he never found any of ti the manuscripts acceptable . Nevertheless , Belasco did much for American dramatic authors . One was Eugene Walter , whose " The Easiest Way " was a sensation in 1909 . The " Wizard 's " Studio . The " wizard 's " studio was an interesting place . In it was a carved oak table , which stood in the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its surface ' bore the marks of the meat aze . The chair in which he sat was Fashioned from a new of the church in , which Shakespeare was buried at Stratfordon-Avon . His waste basket was part of a drum to whose beats Prussian troops marched at the siege of Paris in the war of 1870 . More than a hundred relics of Napoleon were strewn about the seven rooms the producer occupied above his theatre , and his library was said to have been one of the most complete of any dramatic library in the world . The Belasco method of writing a play was often told by the producer himself . He would obtain every possible book relating to the period he wanted , and then he would set about absorbing them . When he came to the plot he would go off in a dark room , and as the play developed he would enlarge upon it with motive and imaginary characters . This done , he would emerge from his sanctuary , call his stenographers and make up the dialogue as he went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with orchestras in some of his productions , maintaining that music in the intervals between acts spoiled the effect of the drama . Fought Actors ' Equity . As the years went by Belasco expanded his work . In 1926 , for example , he had 300 players under contract . He fought the Actors ' Equity Association in 1919 and 1924 , giving way each time to compromise . His last fight with Equity was on the idea of the closed shop . In this battle he was left by many producers in the " die-hard " group which had to make a separate peace with Equity . One of the most lavish of all of Mr. Belasco 's productions was " Mima , " which he presented in 1928 with . an expenditure estimated by Broadway observers at between $300,000 and $350,000 . A setting supposed to represent the infernal regions was built at great expense for the play . On the occasion of ?

At that time Mr. Belasco received word that he had been elected a governor of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon . Differences of five or six years ' standing between Mr. Belasco and David Warfield over Mr. Belasco 's production of " The Merchant of Venice , " in which Warfield starred , were composed last Summer as a result of the actor 's serious illness . For a long time Belasco was against having . any of his plays adapted to moving-picture purposes , yet he relented in 1923 . In 1924 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his work as an artist in . the theatre . Mr. Belasco married Cecilia Loverich in San Francisco , and by her had a daughter , Augusta , who died several years ago . His other daughter Reine , married the producer . Morris Gest .
