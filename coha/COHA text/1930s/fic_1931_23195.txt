POSTERITY AND MR . PRIDDLE A STORY BY ELMER DAVIS M R. HUBERT PRIDDLE , re- tired zinc broker , had reached the age of fifty-eight before he felt any concern about his standing with posterity . A widower with no posterity of his own , he clipped his coupons , minded his own business , and found sufficient occupation for what he never thought of calling his declining years in golf , solitaire , and Masonry . Solitaire and Masonry can be practiced in any setting , but golf must follow the sun ; which was why Mr. Priddle found himself , on a certain February morning , smoking his after-breakfast cigar in a rocking chair on the porch of a hotel in Miami . In the rocker beside him sat Cozzens , the retired newspaper editor from Philadelphia , who grinned as Mr. Priddle opened the New York Times . " Still finding out what happened day before yesterday ? " he inquired . " I 'd rather have the Times two days late than any other paper this morning , " rejoined the imperturbable Priddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you see in it . None of these fakes and distortions . I like the editorial page , too ; you get a sane point of view there . This morning , for instance , they say " He ceased . His jaw dropped . His eye had slipped past the editorials to the page opposite , where the obituaries were on display . " Cozzens ! " he said thickly . " Am I crazy ? Or  --  or am I ? " Mr. Cozzens followed his pointing finger to a story headed : HEBERT ? RIDDLE , ZINC BROKER , DIES AT SARANAC West Side Civic Leader Passes Away in 59th Year WAS HIGH IN MASONRY Advocated **26;192;TOOLONG Movement in 1918 " Bare legs will win the War ? " said Cozzens . " How did you figure that out ? " " Oh , damn that ! " Mr. Priddle snorted . " Cozzens , how could this have happened ? And in the Times , of all papers ! " " Somebody must have made a mis-take . " " I know they made a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his florid face was dark red . " But what ? How on earth -- - " " Well , they must have mixed you up with some other Priddle . " " But this is me ! They 've got all the facts ? born in Rochester , 1873 ; Cornell ' 94 ; past master of Josaphat Lodge , F. &; A. M. ; all about my wife ; even that I was president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association . But I 'm not dead ! Damn it , Cozzens , you know I 'm not dead ! " " They could have got all those facts out of Who 's Who in America . I suppose you 're in that ? " " Not exactly , " Mr. Priddle confessed . " But there 's a volume called Who 's Who in Non-Ferrous Metals . I paid twenty-five dollars for a copy of that after I 'd looked over the notice they gave me . " " And they probably gave a copy to every newspaper library , " Mr. Cozzens supplied . " When they got your death notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Priddle , I know you 're not dead . They got somebody else 's death notice , somehow . " " Of course ? " said Mr. Priddle . " There was a fellow named Herbert Priddle used to live in the next apartment house . He was No. 357 West , and I was No. 367 . We used to get each other 's mail all the time , and I was bothered a good deal by ' phone calls for him-1 was in the book and he was n't . And seems to me I heard he 'd gone to Saranac sometime last fall . " " Then that 's it , undoubtedly . The death notice probably came from Saranac . A careless reporter looked in the ' phone book and found your name and did n't notice that neither the name nor the address was quite right . Things like that do happen , even on the best papers . And then he goes and looks in the morgue  --  the place where they file clippings about everybody who ever had a story in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he found an envelope about Hubert Priddle , with ? Let 's see just what they say about you , after all . " Mr. Priddle 's enfeebled hands abandoned the paper ; Cozzens took it , glanced through the bare chronicle of Mr. Priddle 's career , and found strange news below . On August 1 ? , 1918 , Mr. Priddle advanced the suggestion that women should leave off stockings to further the winning of the War . He had been aroused by a reported shortage of silk for the manufacture of observation balloons , and asked if the lives of our boys at the front must be imperiled for the gratification of women 's vanity . Asked if he would advise the substitution of cotton stockings for silk , Mr. Priddle said that he understood that cotton was needed for the manufacture of high explosives , and that truly patriotic women should have no objection to going bare-legged for the duration of the emergency , or at least until cold weather set in . Much comment was aroused by Mr. Priddle 's proposal , which was approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally condemned in the silk trade and by clergymen . " Interesting idea , " said Cozzens . " Very interesting . Must have been a good local story back in those days . " " Cozzens , it 's an outrage ! It 's bad enough to say I 'm dead ; but to  --  to revive a story like this and make me a laughing stock ? " " Then you really said it ? " Cozzens queried . " Yes . I said it . . . But ? Hell , Cozzens , it is n't as if this was the only idea I ever had on public questions ! I subscribe to the Literary Digest and the Book-of-the-Month Club , and keep up with things that are going on , and have opinions about them . Only I never shoot off my mouth and get my opinions in the paper . " " I see . . . . How did this happen to get in ? " " Well ? " Mr. Priddle flushed . " You remember we were all a little off our balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you know , the fellows who pick out five people at random and ask them all the same question  --  stopped me on lower Broadway at the lunch hour . The question he was asking that day was what further sacrifice by the civilian population would promote the winning of the War . And ? Well , it was the lunch hour , and Broadway was full of girls . Full of silk legs . I  --  I was younger then ; I noticed such things more than I do now . And that was about the time all the girls had started wearing silk  --  stenographers and so on , spending war wages . . . Well , anyway , this reporter asked me his question , and I just blurted out what was on the top of my mind . Never thought any more about it till the other papers took it up next day and started sending reporters around to ask me to develop my idea . . .. Well , thank God , there was another offensive before long , and people forgot all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all these years . . . " They had it in the morgue , " Cozzens explained . " Everything that gets printed about anybody is clipped and filed away in the morgue . And I suppose that was about all they had on you , except that biography from Who 's Who in Non-Ferrous Metals . You never broke into print much , I take it ? " " That was the first time I ever talked to a reporter . And after that I was afraid to talk to them , even if they came from trade papers . " " I see . . . . Well , here 's what happened , Priddle . They confuse this unknown and negligible Herbert Priddle with you . They look you up in the morgue and find you 're a prominent man  --  president of a local civic association , and so on . " " But that civic association does n't amount to anything . A few of us fellows on the West Side got together three or four years ago with the idea of putting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me president ; but then the district leader promised to take care of the assessments , and we never had another meeting . " " But it sounded well , " said Cozzens . " The president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association must have seemed a pretty big man . So the obit editor of the Times decided that he wanted half a column about you , with a spread head . " Mr. Cozzens did not mention what was apparent to the expert eye  --  that it bad been a dull morning for the obituary page . Most of the decedents were veteran mail clerks , widows of suburban mayors , members of long-forgotten French cabinets , or last survivors of up-state posts of the G.A.R. Among such minnows Mr. Priddle must have seemed a whale . " They wanted half a column , " Cozzens repeated , " but the facts would n't stretch out that far . And they could n't find anything else about you except some clippings on your idea that bare legs would win the War . That might not be the only idea you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever got into print ; so they had to fill out with that . Funny , eh ? " " It 's not funny in the least ! " Mr. Priddle announced . " When I 've had opinions for the last forty years and kept them to myself because I thought nobody 'd be interested ; then to have this piece of hot-weather silliness set out as the only thing I ever said that was fit to print ? " " It was no worse than a lot of ideas that got over in 1918 , " Cozzens soothed him . " Of course it 's a pity . If you 'd been used to shooting off your mouth on every occasion , like a few dozen people I could name , the newspaper morgues would have had fat envelopes full of clippings about you ; and the chances are they 'd never have run on to this story at all . . . . However , it 's all done now . Wire the Times you 're not dead , and they 'll print a retraction ; and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't want them to do that , " said Mr. Priddle thoughtfully . " After all , it 's taught me a lesson . " The Times printed a handsome retraction ; Mr. Cozzens read it . But for some days after that he saw no more of Mr. Priddle , either on the golf course or in a rocking chair on the hotel porch . And when at last Mr. Priddle turned up again he announced : " I 've been writing letters . Sending telegrams . Answering old friends who thought they were being funny  --  asking me bow dead I was , and what war bare legs were winning now . You 'd think grown-up men would have more sense . . . . However , " said Mr. Priddle , " I want your advice , Cozzens , on a technical matter . Er  --  how does one go about breaking into print ? " " Why do you want to ? " Cozzens countered . Mr. Priddle flushed . " Well , Cozzens  --  some day the Times is going to print my obituary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; and I 'd hate to have them drag out that old story and reprint it just because they had nothing else . I mean . now that I know they consider me worthy of extended mention , I 'd like to be sure that the article will represent me as I really am  --  my opinions on public questions , and so on . If I only knew how to get the papers to print them . . . " " Why , that 's easy enough . You 're still president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association , and the papers do n't know that it does n't amount to a damn . You 've noticed that when a great man dies the papers print a string of what they call tributes  --  remarks about his life and works , from all sorts of people who sound as if they were somebody . Anybody can break in on that  --  the more the better . So the next time somebody dies like Edison , or Sam Entermyer , or Justice Holmes , think up a couple of hundred words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the papers and tell them that Mr. Hubert Priddle , president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association , wants to add his tribute . If the legislature votes to investigate the Mayor , or somebody makes a transatlantic flight , call up the papers and give them your comment . Never mind how obvious it is . " " But do you mean to say that if I called up the Times and told them what I thought about Edison , they 'd print it ? " " If you said you were president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association they 'd print it . What 's more , " said Cozzens , " if you keep on doing that it wo n't be long before the papers are calling you up and asking you for your tributes . When a great man dies a reporter is assigned to collect tributes ; and sometimes  --  especially on Saturday afternoon  --  they 're hard to get . But make yourself known as one of the stand-bys who always have a tribute on tap , and they 'll be calling you up , grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . " " But ? " Mr. Priddle 's eyes were sad , for lie had just seen the fading of a bright ideal . " But would n't that seem rather undignified ? " " Not half so undignified , " said Cozzens , " as dying again and leaving the papers with nothing to say about you , except that once upon a time you thought that bare legs would win the War . " From that moment there began a great and appalling change in the life of Mr. Hubert Priddle , who had always minded his own business and never thrust himself into public notice . He shook in his shoes the first time he called up the Times , to offer the tribute of the president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association to the late president of the Charity Organization Society ; but an attentive reporter took down what he said , and it was all in the paper the next morning . A day or so later the mail brought an invitation to subscribe to a clipping bureau . Mr. Priddle subscribed , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the late Senator Salpinger was quoted as far west as Portland , Oregon ; his views on the new tariff bill , reported in the New York papers , evoked an editorial in the McKeesport ( Pa . ) Tribune . No longer did he need to offer his views to the papers ; when anything happened they called him up , sure of a comment from that old stand-by , the president of the Schuyler-Endicott Civic Association . Gradually he found himself becoming a public figure ; he was invited to dinners of the Merchants ' Association , of the Town Hall Club ; he was included in Committees of One Thousand . One day 0 . 0 . McIntyre , jotting down the personages encountered in his wanderings about town , included " Hubert Priddle , sage of the West Side , drinking orange juice at Nediek 's . " Mr. Priddle did not know 0 . 0 . McIntyre and had never drunk orange juice at Nedick 's ; but he cheerfully paid for the forty-seven replicas of that notice which his clipping bureau discovered in out-of-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fictitiousness the item proved that he was become a personage of consequence , even of legend ; no longer a mere civic leader , but a figure not to be omitted from any chronicle of wanderings about the town . It was , indeed , disturbing that the figure , the personage , had grown to such stature as to eclipse the old Hubert Priddle  --  the original Hubert Priddle who had minded his own business , taken his pleasure from golf and solitaire and Masonry , and been indifferent to the opinion of posterity . He seldom played golf now , or even solitaire ; he was too busy pasting clippings in huge scrap books , polishing his phrases ofeulogy against the time when some other distinguished person would die , and the papers would look to him for his tribute . He rarely went to lodge any more ; his old friends , respectable but obscure West Side business men , seemed ill at ease in the presence of one whose lightest opinion seemed worthy of quotation in the papers . In his retirement he had found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping of a statue of Hubert Priddle to be left to posterity . The thoughts that he had once kept to himself because he felt that nobody would be interested in them were spread now in the columns of the press ; from them posterity could picture a twentieth-century Pepys , a man aware of the currents of his time , appreciative of its greatness , alive to the significance of every new movement . . . . But would posterity be permitted to see that picture after all ? As year followed year uncertainty grew on Mr. Priddle ; he was keeping all these clippings , but were the papers keeping them , making up their full and rounded record of the sort of man Hubert Priddle had been ? Uncertainty swelled to a gnawing worry and that to an obsession from which he did not know how to free himself  --  till somebody told him that any reputable citizen would be permitted to inspect the clippings in a newspaper morgue . That very evening Mr. Priddle betook himself to the Times office . They received him politely ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed with clippings ; over an employee 's shoulder , they let him read an index card ? " PRIDD LE , HUBERT , Civic leader ; 453678 . " A moment later , Envelope No. 453678 was laid in his hand  --  a thick envelope , stuffed and overflowing . The Times had nobly atoned for its single lapse ; it had printed everything he said , and kept it for the record . The hour he spent with those clippings was the happiest of Mr. Priddle 's life . Not till he reached the very bottom of the stack did he come upon some yellow and crumbling slips of paper dated August 1918 , about bare legs and the winning of the War . ... He looked furtively about ; no one was near , no one was noticing him . He thrust the yellow clippings hastily into his pocket , returned the envelope at the desk , and went out into the night with the serene conviction that all was well . Let the end come when it would , now ; it would only crown the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record  --  everything but one ; materials from which the reporter who would some daycompile his obituary  --  a full column this time , no doubt  --  could leave to posterity a picture of Hubert Priddle as he had really been Engrossed in that bright prospect as he crossed Times Square in the night traffic , he never saw the taxi swinging around a corner that struck him , knocked him headlong , passed over him . Even if he had seen it , in that ecstatic moment of fulfilment he might not have cared . But on that same night died Clara Bow , and Calvin Coolidge . .. . " Priddle ? " said the obituary editor of the Times . " Hell , we have n't got any space to-night to waste on that old windbag . Write me a short paragraph , and run it under a one-line head . " ON THE SHORE BY LINDLEY WILLIAMS HUBBELL H ERE , on this abandoned beach , I could learn to forego The beauty of cities that have done me such grievous wrong . With the low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquish song . Hearing all night the wave breaking on rock , I could forget that I ever knew The ill-timed laugh and the inconsequent word And all the importunate crew Of the wise and the sick of heart . Here in this place , Seeing at morning the green wave crested with white , I would unlearn the barren wisdom of cities , Lest it undo me quite .
