txt President Roosevelt wants to go to Portsmouth . In other words , he wants to follow the example of his illustrious cousin , de original Theodore , and act as mediator or prime mover in a peace conference effort . He wishes to round out his " place in history " with a major contribution to world pacification . If he could lead such a peace effort  --  without having to submit any treaty ' thereafter to the Senate ! ? he would undoubtedly retire to private life , forget all about the third term , and let his successor wrestle ? with various domestic problems . Authority for these statements comes from a dozen diverse , tangible and intangible , sources in Washington . One of the reasons why the Administration is opposed to breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union is that it fears its standing as a mediator or participant in a peace conference might be jeopardized thereby . According to plans now being meditated here , the United States would not go to a peace conference without allies . It would first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking with and for them in the effort to ' regain stability . Indeed , the lines of regional organization already laid down in the Americas mpy be a suggestive basis for co-operation with Europe : This time it is not likely that the United States will even consider direct participation in the organization which might spring up in Europe . Few United States citizens object to peace organization , no matter how formal , in the , Americas . If Europe 's evolution were then in the direction of federalism  --  a method unlikely for some time to bridge the Atlantic  --  this federal grouping could co-operate with the looser organization of the Americas . Where There 's Smoke , There 's Fire " Peace talk " keeps cropping up in WaShington , as in other capitals . So far there has been scarcely anything tangible to it , but the reports ' can not be , ignored . ' It is still a " funny " war in the:sense that nobody rules out the possibility of an early settlement . This is not to say that the Adminiitratian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's previous terms . But the possibility of some internal readjustment in Germany , hot , pecessarily sensational , and the sudden emergence of -a nego= tiable-basis for peace , has not yet been excluded by the nest-informed observers . After all , the world has weathered enough surprises in the last few months to be prepared for the best one of all : a basis for peace . It is on the strength of this talk that Washington speculates , and the President lends an eager ear . Consider Mr. Roosevelt 's position : 1 . Everybody agrees that he would like to retire . 2 . But his prime considerations aie the con tinuation of some sort of progressive program and  --  his plade in history . 3 . And if he does not round out his presidential career with a substantial achievement in world affairs , his record will be decisively mixed and inconclusive . His budget deficits , the tentative nature of recovery , the half-jelled state of many hopeful reforms and the ' altogether discarded state , of many otherS , leave a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rising climax seems to be in international relations . Hence , for the months immediately ahead , it seems more than likely that the President will do everything in his . power to search for a peace basis . There is not much time left . Even if Mr. Roosevelt decided to try for a third term , neither the chance of nomination nor of election is at all assured . During his forthcoming search for peace , the President ought logically to avoid domestic conflicts . Domestic Serenity Seems ProbableThis fits in with the reports that he will have a very modest congressional . program . The main struggle , over the trade agreements program , concerns Secretary Hull more than it does the President . And the budget-paring which the President has announced fits in with the same conciliatory approach . Emergence of Soviet Russia as " Public Enemy No. 1 " on the world scene is likewise consistent ' with the search for peace . Republicans can join . with New Dealers in scolding or penalizing the Red Government , and they are already leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Soviet Union . The " American peace offensive , " or , more exactly , the " Roosevelt peace offensive " is unlikely to go so far as to alarm the Allies . This Government is too deeply sympathetic with the Allies for that . But as time goes on , it is likely to become more perceptible and more pressing . Already , in Cabinet circles , there is talk of " the peace conference . " There is talk , not of a . Wilsonian effort to save the world , but of a Rooseveltian exertion of realistic , politically-minded diplo- : macy. ' he President has a great stake in seeing that the " Roosevelt peace offensive " reaches fruition before next autumn . The world has a ' stake , too , with no time limit attached in either'direction . No doubt the President puts a just , stable peace and the welfare of the world far above his own personal place in history . Nc doubt , also , every effort of administration diplomacy will be exerted to see that the two things coincide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
