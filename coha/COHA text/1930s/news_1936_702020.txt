txt Mayor La Guardia recommended City Chamberlain A. A. Berle Jr . yesterday for the consideration of " independent groups , Republicans and all interested in good municipal government " as his candidate for President of the Board of Aldermen in the Fall election . The Mayor 's announcement , made during his absence , was released by a secretary at the Summer City Hall in the old Bartow Mansion in Pelham Bay Park . It came as an anti-climax , having been forecast on Friday soon after the city 's Republican leaders agreed on Alderman Newbold Morris , Republican , as the party 's candidate for the post . The naming of Mr. Morris , who represents the Fifteenth Assembly District , Manhattan , led the Mayor to say : " I leave it to the people of the City to decide whether they ( the Republicans ) have kept faith in making this designation . " The local Republican leaders who were in the city declined to comment on the Mayor 's announcement of Mr. Berle as his choice . They denied , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their action . They had tried for a week , they said , to get the Mayor either to name his own man or to approve a candidate from a list submitted to him . The best they were able to get was the Mayor 's declaration that he would name his candidate yesterday . Mayor 's Announcement Brief Mr. La Guardia 's announcement was brief . It read : " I submit for the consideration of independent groups , Republicans and all interested in good municipal government the name of Adolf A. Berle Jr . for the office of President of the Board of Aldermen . " Mr. Berle is one of the Mayor 's principal advisers on transit unification . He is also his closest adviser in fiscal matters . The Chamberlain is regarded as a strong New Deal supporter in national politics and was one of the original members of President Roosevelt 's " brain trust . " Kenneth S. Simpson , chairman of the New York County Republican Committee , had already indicated that the Republican leaders would not find Mr. Berle acceptable because of his close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders intimated , must be one who could consistently cooperate in a drive to aid the Republican State and national tickets . Alderman Morris , although regarded as friendly to Fusion in city matters , is understood to be ready to stand squarely on the Republican platforms in State and national affairs . In some quarters it was hinted that the Republican leaders named their candidate without waiting for the La Guardia announcement because they anticipated that Mr. Berle . would be his choice . If they had waited , it was intimated , they would then have been put in the more or less embarrassing position of turning down the Mayor 's rec- ommendation after having gone out of their way to get it . In Defense of Leaders In defense of the stand taken by the Republican leaders it was said that the organization , had it waited for the Mayor 's action , would have been forced either to bear the onus of rejecting a man of an admittedly good record , or to let the Mayor , who is also considered a New Deal proponent , handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not believed that Mr. Morris , without strong independent and Democratic support would be able to overcome the obstacle of the normal Democratic vote which Sheriff William F.

It was also believed , however , that Mayor La Guardia , having voiced his preference for Mr. Berle as the Republican choice , would not go out of his way to assail Mr. Morris even if he would not campaign actively in his behalf . Mr. Berle is traveling in Europe . It was not ascertained whether or not the La Guardia announcement was made with Mr. Berle 's knowledge or approval . The Mayor was not available for any explanation or elaboration of his brief statement . Hope for Second Place Members of the Socialist party organization , which named Julius Hochman , vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , as its candidate for the Aldermanic presidency , were hopeful that their candidate might run at least second in the Fall election .
