At dawn on the morning of May 27 , 1905 the newly invented wireless telegraph began to crackle and spit on a small Japanese warship : " The enemy 's squadron has been sighted at point No. 203 . The enemy is apparently steering toward the Eastern passage . " About 2 p.m. a grizzled little man who had studied at Britain 's Greenwich Naval College and well knew the Nelson tradition hoisted a fluttering ribbon of flags to the truck of his flagship : <P> " The existence of the Empire depends on this battle . Japan expects this day the courage and energy of every officer and every man in the fleet , Togo . " <P> There began the greatest naval battle of modern times-a battle that for grand strategy surpassed Santiago seven years before , for decisiveness outclassed Jutland eleven years later . It was the kind of battle for which nations and navies build and spend and strive and dream for generations . <P> To attempt to recapture Port Arthur and replace Russia 's already shattered Pacific fleet all that was left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Admiral Ziniry Petrovich Rozhestvensky . One half cut through the Mediterranean while the other rounded the Cape of Good Hope . The halves met off Annam and crept cautiously up the China coast . <P> The Japanese commander-in-chief , Admiral Heihachiro Togo , knew that Admiral Rozhestvensky was a brave , capable and intelligent adversary . He knew that the Russian fleet was slightly superior numerically to his own : eight battleships , twelve cruisers , nine destroyers to five battleships , three second-line battleships , 23 cruisers and a flotilla of gunboats , torpedo boats and destroyers . But Admiral Togo also knew that Admiral Rozhestvensky 's fleet was undermanned and under-provisioned , that all its bottoms were foul from its long sea voyage , that it could not carry enough coal to dodge all the way around Japan to Vladivostok with the possibility of being forced into an engagement on the way . With his fleet drydocked , scraped , painted , remunitioned and in review order , Admiral Togo waited confidently by the 122-mile Straits of Tsushima at the entrance to the Japan Sea . <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . Firing opened at 7,000 yards , the two fleets steaming in parallel columns like a classic exercise in an Annapolis textbook . In three quarters of an hour the leading Russian ships were out of action and Admiral Rozhestvensky gravely wounded . After nightfall when the Russian fleet was in hopeless disorder , the Japanese torpedo boats struck .
