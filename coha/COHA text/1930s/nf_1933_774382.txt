Small specimen : length , 22 millimeters ; width , 22 millimeters ; height , 14 millimeters . Description. ? The test of this species is small , low , somewhat depressed , nearly round in ambital outline , except for the rather shallow groove on the anterior margin and the slight , narrow truncation on the posterior margin . The upper surface slopes gradually from the anterior margin posteriorly . The ambulacra are narrow and not deeply sunken . The single anterior ambulacrum is situated in a narrow , rather shallow groove . The anterolateral paired ambulacra have long , narrow , rather shallow petals , and the posterolateral pair are short and shallow . The interambulacral plates are covered with small perforate tubercles . The peripetalous and lateral fascioles are not easily traced . The peristome is in a shallow depression near the anterior margin . The periproct is situated relatively high on the narrow truncated posterior margin . Localities .

The species is so unlike anything known that it has been described even though the state of preservation of all of the fossils in the area is very imperfect . Linthia alabamensis Clark from the Midway group of Alabama and Arkansas is treble the dimensions of the south Texas species . Like L. maverickensis , however , it is apparently associated with Volutocorbis limopsis ( Conrad ) . Occurrence. ? Wills Point ( ? ) formation . Maverick County : U.S. G.S .

A distal multiporous septula ; two or three lateral septulae . Triangular , interopesial hollows having special walls . Genotype . Membranipora lacroixii Auctores . Range. ? Cenomanian ? Recent . The granulations of the mural rim are often very fine and attenuated on the fossil forms . In these also the distal septulae often unite into a very large pore . The hollows of the surface are not interzooecial , as Levinson has described them , but are only interopesial ; they are not deep and are situated between the mural rims ; rarely they contain an avicularium ; their purpose is unknown . In living specimens Waters has described two lucid spots on the dorsal side . These are replaced on the fossils by two hollow impressions in  | the dorsal olocyst . We are ignorant of their use , for they have no connection with the operculum . The type of this genus is very common on the coasts of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . However , no naturalist has made a study of its embryology and anatomy . ( Cann and Bassler , 1920 . ) The zoarium is free , formed of two lamellae growing back to back , irregularly bifurcated ; the fronds are distorted . The zooecia are distinct , irregular , polygonal , or elliptical ; the mural rim is very thin , regular , projecting but little , convex . The opesium has the same form as the zooecium . The interopesial cavities are polygonal and of a very great irregularity . Variations and affinities . This species has zooecia of a disconcerting irregularity ; it is absolutely impossible to discover among them a form the least constant . The same holds true with the interopesial cavities which disappear following the irregularities of the zoarium . The structure of the zooecial walls is quite remarkable . In tangential sections ( fig. 6 ) these walls appear normal but in transversal thin sections , they are thickened , crenulated on the inside , and composed of tissue not very dense ( fig. 5 ) . In the median thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a structure may be noted identical with the zooecial walls ; the olocystal elements grouped around the mural rim appear to be chambered ( fig. 7 ) . Finally , a section taken perpendicularly to the plane of the fronds ( fig. 8 ) shows that the zoarium is formed of two lamellae placed back to back and separable . The false chambering of the mural rim is not analogous to the formation of dietellae in Periporosella ; we find in reality in every species chambered in this way some large , scattered , unoriented olocystal elements ( figs. 4 , 6 ) . The zoarium itself is quite constant and characteristic ; it often assumes , although rather vaguely , among other shapes , the form of the horns of a deer , hence our specific name . As its zoarial dimensions exceed two centimeters , we may consider this species as an easily recognized , characteristic fossil . Unfortunately , the species has not yet been discovered in many of the localities of the Midwayan . Occurrence. ?

The identity of the mode of occurrence in the Tehuacana member of the Kincaid formation of Limestone and Medina counties is significant .

( Gabb , 1860 . ) Harris in 1896 , ignoring Whitfield 's attempt ( 13b ) to give the name gabbana to the Tennessee species , renamed the Tennessee shell which Gabb had confused with that he had formerly described from Burlington County , New Jersey . Whitfield , though he cited Gabb 's description and figure of the Hardeman County shell , described at  | some length and figured a cast from the Cretaceous marls of Freehold , New Jersey , considering it identical with the Tennessee species and renaming it Nuculana Gabbana , Since 1885 , the Cretaceous species has commonly appeared in the literature under the name gabbana and in view of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems not only highly desirable but legitimate to continue to restrict gabbana to the Cretaceous shell and to adopt Harris 's saffordana for the Eocene shell . The species , though fragile , is abundant and well preserved in the micaceous , slightly glauconitic sands of Middleton , Hardeman County , Tennessee . It is characterized by the relatively large and compressed valves and by the abrupt disappearance of the concentric sculpture upon the rostrum .

( Woodring , 1925 . ) The group , which becomes increasingly prominent through the later Tertiaries to the Recent , has a meager representation in the Midway .

Another species , small , rather compressed , ovate-trigonal in outline , and finely striated upon the disk but smooth distally , is represented by abundant impressions in the Wills Point formation .

The length of the original , taken from the figure , is 11 millimeters ; of the figure published in the Bulletin of American Paleontology , 9 millimeters , a difference so slight that no marked age variation can be postulated .

Length % inch . ( Conrad , 1860 . ) Type locality. ? Conrad 's only clue to a type locality is the statement that " Dr. Showalter of Uniontown , Alabama , has sent me some Eocene shells which appear to be new , and are from a locality further north in Alabama than any Mr. Tuomey had explored . " The late Truman H. Aldrich , of Birmingham , Alabama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alabama , informed me that some , possibly all , of Doctor Showalter 's collection came from the Matthews Landing horizon , but after Showalter 's death his collection , which he had kept in his residence , was thrown out and the labels destroyed so that the loss is final . Leda smirna is ovate in outline , well rounded , polished and often showing color bands that may be the remnant of the original pattern . The incised lines upon the medial portion of the shell are regular and sharp but they are less distinct anteriorly and completely disappear in the majority of individuals in front of the rounded posterior keel . Leda smirna is a smaller , more inflated shell than Leda saffordana Harris from the lower Midway of Hardeman County , Tennessee . The posterior keel of saffordana is upcurved and much more pronounced than in L. smirna and the concentric sculpture stronger , though like that of smirna it is obsolete upon the rostrum . In Alabama Leda smirna Dail is restricted to the lower part of the Naheola formation ( Matthews Landing horizon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a larger , less trigonal species . The Leda smirna material in the lower Midway Kincaid formation in Texas is mostly juvenile or imperfect , so that it has  | been impossible to separate it with any degree of assurance from the well preserved Leda snzirna of the higher Midway ( Wills Point formation ) . It is probable , however , that a distinction exists . The species has never been recognized in the basal Midway . Leda smirna is not notably abundant but it is widespread in the middle Midway . Leda swiftia.na Rathbun from Maria Farinha , Pernambuco , Brazil , is a possible analogue and L. corpulentoides Aldrich from the lower Wilcox is a probable descendant ; in any case , a very closely related species .

Toward the umbones the radials are sharply elevated , though they tone down into an even fluting toward the outer margin .  | Ostrea tasex is probably identical with Ostrea multilirata Conrad , collected from the so-called Cretaceous of " Dry Creek , Mexico .

( Gardner , 1923 . ) The name tasex was later rejected in favor of Conrad 's multilirata because of the strong circumstantial evidence that Conrad had the Wilcox species in mind and hand and that he merely failed to recognize that its association with O. cortex was accidental . The two species are associated by the drainage both on the Texas and the Mexican side of the Rio Grande . Ostrea multilirata is restricted to the Wilcox group , but a closely related form is scattered about in pockets at the top of the Tehuacana member of the Kincaid formation .

Radial sculpture is sometimes suggested by the color pattern but is rarely developed and is never strong . A concentric imbrication may be observed in some species , particularly toward the ventral margin . The discrepancy in ornamentation so common in Pseudarnussium is reflected in the discrepant coloring in Amusium s. s .

The thin , internally lirate shells of Antusiunt require a much more specialized habitat than the heavy , externally ribbed shells of most of the Pecten group , and perhaps for this reason the genus is relatively rare . The subgenus is characterized by the small , delicate valves , the small , subequal auricles , the fine concentric imbrication , and the distant internal radials which do not persist to the ventral margin . The representatives of this small group are not abundant but they are widely distributed both in time and space .

Lower Miocene ( Chipola formation ) of Florida . The American Miocene Venericardia are not so high as the typical or Venericor or Leuroactis . For this group the new subgeneric name Glyptoactis is proposed with V. hadra Dail as the type species ( Dail , 1903 , p. 1429 , pl. 53 , figs. 11 , 13-Chipola ) . The species differ from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small anterior pustule or lateral . The right hinge of a closely related species has been figured by Dail ( 1903 , p. 1430 , pl. 53 , fig. 12 ) and his figures of both species have been reproduced by Gardner ( U. S. Geol . Survey Prof. Pap . 142-B , 1926 , p. 90 , pl. 17 , figs. 11-13 ) . The group is known from the Eocene ? V. alticostata ( Harris , Bull . Am . Pal . v. 6 , 1919 , p. 82 ,  |p1.  30 , figs. 1-5 , Claiborne ) and is still living on the West Central American coast as V. cuvieri Broderip ( Reeve , Conch . Iconica , v. 1 , 1843 , pl. 5 , fig. 24 Cardita ) . Judging from the figures V. acuticostata from the French Eocene is another member of this group ( Cossmann and Pissarro , 1906 ,  |p1.  31 , fig. 97 ? 7 , Lutetien-Bartonien ) . " Cardita " sandiegoensis from the Eocene of California may also be a Glyptoactis ( Hanna , Univ . Cal . Bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pl. 37 , figs. 1 ? 2 , 8 ? 9 ) . The hinge of Glyptoactis suggests the minute Mediterranean Glans Megerle 1811 ( Bncquoy , Dautzenberg and Dollfus , Moll . Roussillon , v. 2 , 1892 , p. 231. pl. 38 , fig. 21 ? 25 ) which has more distinct laterals and a shorter right cardinal enlarged anteriorly . Were it not for the similarity of Glyptoactis with some of the species of Venericardia s.s . I should place Glyptoactis under Glans but the resemblance may be fortuitous , and temporarily at least Glyptoactis is better left under Venericardia since it is difficult if not impossible at the present time to recognize the two groups among immature Eocene specimens . These specimens may actually show the development of a subgenus but such an interesting conclusion could only be accepted after a much more exhaustive study of them has been made .

Mus . No. 370913 . Several unsuccessful attempts were made to find this locality . The closest approach to it is represented in a collection made in 1932 by L. W. Stephenson and C. E. Cook from 2.5 miles southeast of the Travis-Bastrop County line . Beautifully preserved specimens of Venericardia bulla pack the glauconitic marls of the Colorado River below the Caldwell ranch house . The shells are commonly removed and the matrix indurated , forming a ledge which may be followed for a considerable distance . It is extraordinary that a species locally so prolific should be restricted in its known areal distribution to a single county . Venericardia bulla Dall bears a striking resemblance to Veneri-cardia wilcoxensis Dall ( Pl. 14 , figs. 1-3 ) , a name which has a geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Alabama , where the material was collected and where  | the Naheola formation of the Midway group is exceptionally well developed . The individual reproduced from Plate 54 of volume 3 , part 6 of the Transactions of the Wagner Free Institute of Science , is higher relatively and more rounded trigonal in outline than the usual individual which is , like V. bully , suhovate to subquadrate in outline . Venericardia bully has broader , fuller umbones than its Alabama analogue and slightly more numerous ribs , especially upon the posterior area , but otherwise it would be hazardous to attempt to separate the two species . Their striking similarity offers an excellent basis for the correlation of the Texas and Alabama sections for they are both abundant within the restricted area in which they are developed . The possibility of confusion of the Alabama species with Venericardia alticostata offers the only explanation of the delay of the description of the form until 1903 .

Even the family name  - -  whether they shall be called the Turridae or the Turritidae is a subject for discussion . Practically all of the old generic names such as Pleurotoma and Surcula with types from the Indo-Pacific have been discarded , and the present tendency is toward a rather bewildering multiplication of generic names . Certainly the turretids exhibit decided group tendencies , both geographic and geologic and it is highly desirable to recognize such relationships in the nomenclature . For that reason , names such as De Gregorio 's Coronia and Casey 's Orthosurcula have been utilized rather than the better known Pleurotoma and Surcula which have come to mean little more than operculate turretids with long anterior canals and the siphonal notch upon the periphery , and operculate turretids with long anterior canals and the siphonal notch upon the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undescribed groups , the old generalized names have been retained .  | Shell small , turriculate ; the whorls angular , the periphery in many species outlined by a double spiral ; protoconch of 2 or more smooth rapidly enlarging whorls succeeded by one or more convex whorls adorned with numerous obliquely arcuate costae . Both axial and spiral sculpture upon the conch , the axial tending to be oblique , the spiral most prominent upon the periphery and in front of it ; body constricted rather abruptly into a narrow straight and fairly short broad canal ; aperture narrow ; siphonal fasciole rather shallow , following the periphery . Coronia has been considered a synonym of Hemipleurotoma by Cossmann and others but the type of Hemipleurotoma is Pleurototna archimedis Bellardi from the Miocene of northern Italy . No specimens are available for comparison and the tip is broken away in the figured individual , but apparently in the Italian Miocene species , the fasciole is more constricted and deeper , and in the Italian forms related to P. archimedis in their conchal characters , the protoconch is smaller and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multispiral protoconch of Coronia bars it also from Eopleurotoma , a Paris Basin Eocene group of similar aspect . Coronia includes the compact assemblage of Gulf Eocene turretids characterized by the rather large , conic , multispiral protoconch in which the earlier whorls are smooth , the later costate ; by the slender fusoid conch , with both the axial and spiral sculpture strongest upon the periphery , and by a siphonal notch , broad and not remarkably deep , following the periphery of the whorl as in true Pleurotoma .

The outer lip projects in the middle as a broad rounded lobe beyond the juxtasulurat part , with the sinus large and posterior , as in Surcula , and the embryo is paucispiral . ( Casey , 1904 . ) The lower Eocene species retain a feeble retractive axial sculpture upon the earlier whorls of the conch and though this character is pushed farther back in the Oligocene , it is still manifest in many ndividuals of the type species as a shallow undulation of the periphery . The protoconch of the type includes 3 to 31/2 smooth , polished whorls rapidly increasing in size and about three-fourths of a whorl with sharp obliquely arcuate costae .

A species possibly referable to Marginella is represented by three individuals from the limestone 5 miles southeast of Elstone ( U.S.G.S.  | Sta. 117711 , Medina County . The best specimen is one centimeter high and a little more than half as broad . The spire is about half as high as the entire shell and the sutures are thinly washed with callous .

The volutes , as a family , are separated from the Marginellidae , on the one hand , by the larger size , the unpolished surface , the greater prominence of the anterior canal , and the columella slightly recurved toward the axis of the shell . From the Mitridae , on the other hand , the volutes differ , as a rule , in the decreasing prominence of the columellar folds anteriorly instead of posteriorly as in the mitras . Dall introduced the name as a subgenus under Volutilithes . Shell resembling Volutilithes , but more slender and without a coronated shoulder ; the sculpture is reticulate and nodose or prickly at the intersections ; the sutural sinus is less evident than in Volutilithes and the suture is sometimes channelled . ( Dail . 1890.1 The nomenclature of this old and world-wide distributed group is extremely involved . Volutilithes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to it Conrad referred the two characteristic Midway species , lintopsis and rugatus . Dall ( 16a ) retained the name Volutilithes for species such as those of the V. petrosus group in this country and V. spinosus Lamarck in Europe . He erected the subgenus Volutocorbis to accommodate the two common Gull Midway forms , rugata and lintopsis , a few species from the European faunas , and the Recent V. abyssicola Adams and Reeve . Harris in his Midway monograph , used only the generic name Volutilithes ,  | but Cossman ( 29a ) recognized Volutocorbis and raised it to generic rank . Dail ( 30a ) in 1906 stressed the necessity of a thorough revision of the nomenclature of the volutes and suggested that " the shells typified by Voluta spinosa , and which are usually called Volutilithes , will probably take the name of Plejona Bolten , 1798 . " A little later in the same year R. Bullen Newton ( 30b ) carefully discriminated Volutilithes Swainson , 1831 , from that of Swainson , t840 , and rejected Plejona because of the confusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolten pars and Volutilithes Swainson , 1840 , non Swainson , 1831 . He retained Volutocorbis Dall , however . The question was fully reviewed in 1926 by Stewart ( 67a ) who also retains Volutocorbis . In the same year in which Dail and Bullen Newton were publishing on the nomenclature of the group , Burnett Smith 's paper on the " Phylogeny of the Races of Volutilithes petrosus " ( 30c ) appeared . The greater part of his material cane from the Eocene of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers and ranged in time from the Midway at Matthews Landing to the Jackson formation . The Midway and Wilcox representatives of the group probably lived in a shallow sea , intermittently cut off from the open ocean in which normal development was very slowly taking place . Successive invasions of the sea brought with them new forms which , when subjected to the less favorable , partially lagunal conditions underwent a very rapid senile development . Volutocorbis limo psis is considered the ancestral type not only because of its primitive character but also because of its stability and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a short , senile offshoot of V. liinopsis . There is only one living member of the group , V. abyssicola Adams and Reeve , a cancellated form bearing a remarkable resemblance to its possible progenitor of the early Eocene .

The curved rib stage usually occupies the latter part of four and early part of five . Its ribs are wide apart and it persists for about a quarter of a whorl . It is followed by the straight , tubercled ribs of the cancellated stage . The two upper tubercles are the largest , those below becoming fainter anteriorly . The ribs die away anteriorly on the branchial siphon . Each tubercle is connected with the corresponding one of the next whorl by a spiral . Whorls 6. 7 , 8 ?

In others the rib is swollen into a very rounded , transversely long angle which hardly occupies the position of the shoulder angle of later forms , and in addition the shells become thick . In all individuals the mantle protrudes in the region of the anal siphon , and tends to smooth the preceding whorl with a shelly overgrowth . This latter is never extreme . Whorl 10 ?

This species in its earlier stages of growth closely resembles V. limopsis . It differs radically , however , from that form with the progress of its ontogeny . Though its individuals vary greatly , it is nevertheless entitled , in the opinion of the author , to rank as a distinct species . In its later whorls there is great individual variation , accompanied by senile features . These latter , though never extreme , are well marked . They comprise protrusion of the mantle in the region of the anal siphon , producing a smoothing of the preceding whorl by a shelly overgrowth ; thickening of the shell , and irregularity of growth lines . There is no spiny stage . V. rugatus is considered to he a short senile offshoot from V. limopsis . In the absence of intermediate forms this evolution must have taken place either at some other locality or at some geologically earlier date .

The aperture is perhaps a little more than half as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wide and probably not more than 5 excluding the nuclear turns . The ribs are narrow and pinched with broadly concave interspaces and tend to be irregular or obsolete upon the final half turn . On the spire , they terminate abruptly a little in front of the posterior suture but are uniformly strong on the middle and anterior portions of the whorl and well down upon the base of the body . No traces of a spiral sculpture have been preserved . The aperture is narrow and lenticular in outline , the outer lip somewhat varicose , the inner excavated at the base of the body and the canal , probably rather long for the genus , twisted slightly backward and emarginate . The number and disposition of the columellar folds is not known . Though rather common at this single locality , this well characterized species has not been recognized elsewhere .

The whorls are relatively few , not more than 5 exclusive of the nuclear turns and they taper rapidly . The body whorl is conic in outline . The strong , narrow ribs run about 8 to the later whorls and about 10 to the earlier . They terminate abruptly a little in front of the posterior suture and on the later whorls the ends of the ribs are expanded into nodes which coronate the whorl . The interspaces are broadly and rather deeply concave . A fine wavy spiral liration is faintly perceptible under magnification over the entire shell . The suture is closely appressed and undulated by the axials of the preceding volution . The characters of the aperture are not preserved but it was doubtless narrow and the canal short .

I have the pleasure of naming this exceptionally fine species in honor of Frederick B. Plummer , to whom I am deeply indebted for his hearty cooperation and his timely courtesies . It is probable that Fusus hubbardanus Harris from the Midway of Mississippi is related , though certainly there is no question of a possible identity . Smaller forms , apparently less coarsely sculptured both axially and spirally , are associated with Fasciolaria ? plummeri . One of these , Figure 3 , has been figured . The relationship of these individuals to the type of F. plummeri is not clear . Fasciolaria ? plummeri is one of the few elements in the Midway fauna that is reminiscent of the Cretaceous . Large univalves of this general aspect are rare in the Eocene faunas but are widespread in the Upper Cretaceous . Occurrence . Kincaid formation . Caldwell County : U.S.G.S. Sta. 11707 , 5 ? miles due north of Lockhart , about one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of an exceptionally fine species , probably referable to Fasciolaria , was collected from the limestone scarp near the Indio Wells in Maverick County ( U. S. Nat . Mus . No. 370932 ) . The greatest diameter of the shell is between 55 and 60 millimeters . A row of prominent tubercles , elongated axially and probably about 15 in number decorated the body , directly in front of the suture . A coarse and regular spiral sculpture is developed upon the sides and probably upon the base of the body . The basal constriction is abrupt and the canal moderately broad . This species exhibits the general features of Fasciolaria plummeri but the tuberculated shoulder is not so broad , the tubercles more numerous and more prominent , the spirals 10 or 11 upon the sides of the body instead of 4 or 5 , and the constriction at the base of the body more abrupt .  | Fragments of a large species , probably more closely allied to Fasciolaria hubbardi than to F. plummeri , occur in the lower part of the Midway fossiliferous section on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genus FALSIFUSUS Grabau Type . ? Fuses ottonis Aldrich Fuses meyeri Aldrich , 1886 , non Fusus meyeri Dunker , 1871 . ( Midway of Alabama . ) Shells fusiform , with a long and slender spire , and a canal of about the same length . Protoconch merging into the whorls of the conch , no sharp line of demarkation being apparent . The first two whorls of the protoconch are generally smooth , the apical one minute , gradually increasing in size . The three to four whorls which constitute the apical series form a rather narrow cone . Third whorl with fine closely crowded , more or less oblique riblets , which in part are gently concave forward . These after the completion of the third , or sometimes an additional whorl , quickly merge into the normal whorls of the conch . A basal carina usually marks the ribbed whorls of the apical series , this carina appearing just above the suture . Whorls of the conch as in Fusus . ( Grabau , 1904 . ) The similarity of the early stages of Falsifusus and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather distant , the central one making a sharp carina on the center of each whorl , with erect longitudinal tubercles at the intersections ; spaces between striae showing only lines of growth ; canal very long , spirally striated with alternate raised lines ; lines of growth very numerous and almost obsolete ; mouth small , oblong-ovate ; outer lip incurved. smooth . Locality. ? Lower bed , Woods ' Bluff , Ala. ; Matthews ' Landing , Ala . The figured type retains four embryonic whorls ; three are smooth , the fourth longitudinally striate . The Matthews ' Landing form is smaller and even more beautiful . One specimen has the ribs obsolete on the upper half of the whorls and the periphery armed with erect longitudinal spines , giving the shell a very strongly carinate form . Fusus Mississippiensis Con. , from Vicksburg , resembles this form , but this is more carinate , with longer canal and spire ; the latter species has many more revolving lines , and the outer lip is striate internally . Named in honor of Dr. Otto Meyer . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of the species from Woods Bluff and Matthews Landing , but gave no name to the Midway species . He noted the following differences : The body whorls are not so widely different as are the spires . In the Matthews Landing ? Oak Hill type there are as high as 18 costae on some of the whorls . They are sharp , well defined , direct from the suture to the sharp carina . In the Wood 's Bluff forms the costae on the spire number the same as on the body whorl , about 7 or 8 ; they are also of the same form . Again in the Wood 's Bluff forms there is no tendency for the third line below the keel to become very prominent as it does in the Matthews ' Landing specimens . It is possible the two may be united by intermediate forms , but there is reason certainly fin doubting it . The species or group of species is certainly represented in Texas hut by fragmentary material only , which is apparently very close to the Matthews Landing form but throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midway races . Grabau has used Aldrich 's first name , F. meyeri " since the present species is not a Fusus and Dunker 's Fusus meyeri is , " ( Grabau , op. cit . ) . The danger of confusion is not eliminated , however , and ottonis , the name which Aldrich himself suggested to replace his preoccupied meyeri seems the better choice . Grabau described in minute detail the protoconch of Falsi f usus ottonis , the type of his genus . A crushed specimen from marls of the Brazos River just above the Falls County line ( U.S.G.S. Sta. 10801 ) has preserved no characters by which it may be separated from Falsifusus ottonis of the Midway of Alabama .  | A strongly turreted spire of a related species with the crenulated periphery emphasized by a prominent spiral thread was recovered from the lower part of the fossiliferous section on the Colorado River ( U.S.G.S. Sta. 11696 ) . In this form , however , only a single spiral intervenes between the periphery and the anterior suture .
