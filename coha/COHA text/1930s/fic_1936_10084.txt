could not grasp deter him from going to the Rue des Perles ? He groped back in his mind but could discover no valid reason for the diffidence that obsessed him . It was true that Anne-Marie , disturbed by the dangerous predicament of the Marquis de Meyracq and emotionallyexhausted from the unexpected and undesired journey to Paris , had been so sunken in her own woes as practically to ignore his presence but that had been understandable . She had been abruptly tossed from her accustomed orbit in life and was fumbling blindly in alien ways . After all , there was no reason . . . He turned his head , vaguely conscious of a rapping at the door . Mr. Paine ? " Come in , " he called with a decided lack of warmth in his voice . When the door swung slowly inward and he saw Anne-Marie standing on the threshold he was quite bereft of speech . A sudden shame suffused his cheeks and he started stumblingly to his feet . " Mademoiselle . . . " he said in a stuttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she stepped across the lintel and accepted the chair that he blunderingly dragged forward . " Is Alain here ? I came . . . " she began to say in a voice that was a little loud and self-conscious . Then she recovered herself and began to laugh in the old natural manner that took him straight back to Tressillac . " How ridiculous , David , " she said . " I came to see you after passing through expectation , impatience , indignation and humiliation . There ! My father is much offended at you and I have sworn a solemn vow never to speak to you again . Are all Americans as fickle in their friendships as you appear to be ? Explain to me instantly this outrageous aloofness that you pursue . Has Mr. Paine convinced you that the company of royalists is a mortal sin ? " " Mr. Paine has n't . . . I did n't . . . " he protested incoherently . She sat looking up at him , leaning a little forward with her chin cupped in her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey-green eyes , stirred deep-sea shadows in them . His foolih embarrassment magically dissipated before her friendly glance and he sat down with a faint smile playing about the corners of his mouth . " Mea culpa , " he said . " An overscrupulosity as to the value of my company is the first mark of my dotage . I thought that you and M. Couetus had had enough of me . Forgive me for the mistaken assumption . " " I do , " she answered immediately , " and I retract my solemn vowP201with some relief . Now tell me what you have been doing during this past month . " He leaned forward and began to tell her . Alain Gihon turned away from the crowded table with some reluctance . Now that he had rediscovered M. Danton he was once more charmed by the assertive undisciplined personality of the burly untidy rhetor . There were obvious reasons why Danton was the uncrowned king of the Cordeliers district . His frenetic discourses , his diatribes against the astronomer-mayor of Paris , Bailly , and the commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brutal directness of speech that he evinced on all occasions , his scorn of moderation and his fiery perorations on liberty completely dominated the population of this effervescent quarter . Here on the left bank of the Seine he was a local Titan and already the Hotel de Ville feared and hated him . He was one of those ungovernable forces that are resistless in their impacts on the mass mind , and Nature , endowing him with a huge stature , a scarred rocky face and a voice of bull-like sonorousness , had shaped him superbly for the role he chose to play . During the days that Alain had scurried about Paris on various missions for Louis-David Couetus he had often passed the Cafe Procope on the Rue de 1'Ancienne-Comedie and several times he had dropped in to see if Danton was there . He had been disappointed . But now he had scored an unsuspected success . Proceedingfrom his new quarters on the Rue Vivienne to the dwelling of one Ambroise Pic ( an agent through whom Louis-David was transferringfunds to England ) in the Rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on a sudden impulse , pushed open the door . There sat M. Danton at a crowded table . Alain had pushed his way forward until he stood close behind the great man . It was the energy emanating from Danton that charmed Alain , the restless virility that poured from his big muscular body and snapped in his expressive eyes . He was overflowing with life , with a physical gusto in existence that curiously affected the slim young Frenchman . Danton reminded him of trees , of rocks , of ploughed fields and thunder over the marshes of Poitou . What he had to say was of less significance . It was the magnetism of the man that mattered . For a youthful intelligence less interested in politics than the immediateresponses of mortal sensibilities Danton was an awakening force . He wedded in himself a revolutionary ardour and a personal appeal that became a powerful antagonist to overwhelm and pushed the uncertain mind helplessly before it . Alain , who had remained untouched by the bullying persistencies of his brother and the feverishargumentation of Versailles , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt in the chieftain of the Cordeliers quarter a man of action and a prophet in one . There was a convincingnessabout Danton that the others lacked , a magnetic impact that was irresistible . As yet the young Frenchman did not feel himself implicated in the Revolution . It had not become a personal matter to him and that was because he was devoid of such ambitions as stirred his brother . His life at Tressillac had been happy and the feudal system , so far as he could see , had not injured him at all . He was naturally religious and he was instinctively loyal to the King . The many favours that Louis-David had shown him and the frank friendship of Anne-Marie had constantly exhibited the Nobility in a pleasant light to him . But now that he had heard Danton speak he began dazedly to wonder a little about himself and his place in the chaotic flux of the times . It was no more than a vague curiosity but it was growing insidiously every day and pressing mysteriously against the walls of his self-satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burly chieftain and hear from his lips the reasons for the changing state of affairs . As he turned from the crowded table he could hear the stuttering voice of Danton 's sallow-skinned friend , the journalist Camille Desmoulins , describing an action at law that had been taken against him . " I call a cat a cat , " declared the sinister-eyed young man who sat at Danton 's right hand as John sat at the side of Christ , " and Sanson an executioner . " There was a murmur of approving laughter about the table . It appeared that Charles-Henri Sanson , the executioner of criminaljudgments in Paris , had brought suit against Desmoulins for libel , and the reckless young man , a born agitator blessed with a vitriolic pen , was preparing to strike back . Alain walked out of the Cafe Procope while Desmoulins embarked on a satirical invective against what he was pleased to call " the representative of executive power . " It was not Desmoulins who particularly interested the young Frenchman . He had seen him before . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know something about Camille Desmoulins who represented the full flowering of the Palais-Royal energumenes . Everybody had read his Discours de la Lanterne aux Parisiens and both La France Libre , his pamphlet advocating a republic , and his lately established journal , Revolutions de France et de Brabant , were in every bookshop . But Desmoulins with hisp203ungovernable stuttering tongue , his wretched manner of speaking and a certain wolfishness of demeanour impressed Alain not at all . It was Danton who roused his curiosity and respect , Danton , who sat like a disarrayed god over the stained table and bellowed in his cavernous chest , Danton , whose flashing eyes lit up his pitted countenanceand whose very ugliness was a signature of energy . Alain had said very little to David about Danton . And now as he pursued his way through the cold streets toward the river and the Rue Vivienne he began to wonder why he had not discussed this powerful personality more fully with his friend . He was certainly not trying to keep Danton to himself . Perhaps his comparative silence had been occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders . As a matter of fact , during the short time that they had been together the hours of both young men had been filled with the busy activity of putting their common quarters in order . There had been little time to discuss the endless phenomena of the uneasy city . But now that the rooms in the Rue Vivienne were settled ( and David would have hung the last print by the time he reached the house ) there would be ample opportunity for many long conversations , intimate discussions stretching far into the night . At this thought Alain somewhat accelerated his pace . The fact that he was dwelling with David was of vast import to him . He was wretchedly aware of the great gap that the loss of his brother had left in him , and though Anne-Marie by her unvarying understanding and feminine tenderness had partially filled it , he felt the necessity of possessing a masculine mind that was near and dear to him . He had found it in David and he meant to cherish it . The idea of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Boulay had not been born on the moment . It had been considered all the way from Vitre to Paris . A natural fearfulnessof refusal had choked it back until that last moment and then when he had blurted it forth and found it eagerly welcomed his delight had been positive and immense . What the future would do to their common relationship he neither knew nor cared . He was content to live wholly in the present . He was aware that he was unformed , that his manhood was like a new coat which he wore somewhat self-consciously , that his mind was volatile and unsettled  --  the mind of a boy , that he had naturally followed the line of least resistance during the few years that separatedhim from the callow propensities of countrified youth , but all these matters he hoped to translate into more stable attributes under the friendly guidance of David . Everything that had happened to him had happened during the past ten months . Last April he had been a shy uncertain native of Tressillac . But since then he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution and had witnessed its fury in the burning of the chateau . Never far from Louis-David Couetus , he had taken his colour from him , placidly letting the older man think for him and pausing not at all to consider that he was a commoner in the service of a nobleman , a rather unusual nobleman , to be sure , and that such a curious relationship as existed between him and the Seigneur of Tressillac was abhorrent in the eyes of the revolutionists . Well , he was not a revolutionist . He had not even thought fixedly upon the subject . It was only now when the vehement voice of Danton stirred and charmed him that he began to wonder just exactly where he stood so far as the Revolution was concerned . That was something that he would have to work out with David . He crossed the bridge , passing a man who was having a tooth pulled to the intense joy of the idlers , and struck into the congeries of twisting streets that led toward the Palais-Royal . It was cold and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere to his left was the great pile of the Tuileries hemmed in by parasitic buildings and narrow alleys and thoroughfares . A few National Guards loitered along the bleak streets . Alain proposed to cut across the Palais-Royal gardens and reach the Rue Vivienne that way . Yes , he would have to go into this matter of Danton with David . It would never do to discuss any of the revolutionary leaders with Louis-David Couetus , for the nobleman had changed decidedly from the smiling gentleman with liberal tendencies who had ventured so optimistically upon Versailles ten months before . The burning of Tressillac following so closely upon the insults offered to the King and Queen during the October days had been disastrous blows to his auspicious hopes . He had suddenly beheld a terrible vision of impending events and it needed not Litanies of the Lantern or baying orators in the Palais-Royal or mushroom publications or the fulminationsof the Breton Club ( now transferred from Versailles , and , because it met in a hall of the Jacobin Convent , popularly called the Jacobin Club ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one direction . It was this monstrous undercurrent that caused the general dissatisfaction and inquietude in the city and occasioned the constant threats and angers against the clergy , the nobility , the court , and the emissaries of England . Hardly maskingtheir designs the fomenters of rebellion against the throne , the John the Baptists of the visionary Republic , the paid agents of the tenebrous-minded Duc d'Orleans , the secret lodges of the Free/masons and the quacks and prophets of a dozen impossible Utopias schemed , conspired and lashed the people to fury against the monarchyof Louis XVI . The Seigneur of Tressillac , therefore , expected the worst to happen , and Alain , seeing hire so grim and thoughtful , realized the impossibility of discussing calmly with him the potentialitiesof such figures as Georges-Jacques Danton of the Cordeliers quarter . The young man hurriedly mounted the steps from the Galerie de Beaujolais and passed beneath the arches into the Rue Vivienne . At the corner of this thoroughfare and the Rue des Petits-Champs a harlot in a dirty flounced dress hissed like a goose at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without turning his head . He knew that all the surrounding streets were rabbit warrens of prostitution , that in the Rue des Bons-Enfants , the Rue de Rohan , the Rue de Chartres , the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs , the Rue du Bouloi , the Rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs and a dozen others the painted women maintained their tawdry state and were nightly patronized by all ranks from court dandies to the humblest baker 's boy serving in the National Guard . But this side of Parisian life interested him not at all . With the exception of Anne-Marie , and he was certain that this was a sublimated affection , he had never experienced a fondness for women . He turned hastily in at the house numbered fifteen , crossed the court and mounted the stairs to the first floor . When he flung the door back with a cry of greeting he was momentarily surprised to see that David had a visitor . Anne-Marie Couetus , leaning comfortablyback in the chair he had purchased on the Rue Saint-Honore , was gazing interestedly into the American 's eyes and listening to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet when Alain entered the room . " Behold ! " he exclaimed . " Our first visitor ! I had just placed the last picture on its hook when she appeared like a visible blessing from Nature . " " The honour is beyond all speech , " said Alain smilingly as he crossed to the young woman and bowed over her hand . " It is beyond all propriety , " remarked Anne-Marie , " but , at least , it was impulsive . David has been telling me the exciting tale ' of how these pleasant rooms were furnished . I am desolate that I did not catch a glimpse of you and him staggering through the crowded Palais-Royal beneath that escritoire . " " It was a spectacle that surpassed the Prussian Giantess , " declared Alain . " I low thoughtful of you to come ! Do you like our quarters ? " " ' They are charming , " said Anne-Marie , glancing about . " I admireeverything but the prints . . . and I am certain David selected those . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pic 's house ? " " I did , " responded the young man , " and he has the business concernedwell in hand . I have a memorandum which I intended delivering to your father this evening but since you are here . . . " " I will take it , " said Anne-Marie . She turned to David , who was standing and gazing somewhat dejectedly at the newly-hung prints . " M. Pic , " she explained , " is a curious gentleman who has private methods of his own for corresponding with England . " David turned . " Ah , " he said uncomprehendingly . He had never seen such insipid faces in prints before in his life and he mentally vowed to have the entire batch down from the wall before he went to bed . Tomorrow he would get some nice drawings of dogs and horses . So far as he remembered he had never happened upon a simpering dog or horse . " You will be interested to know that the Marquis de Meyracq arrived in Paris today , " remarked Anne-Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman . " The diligence stages must have been frightfully aggravating to him . " " They were , " agreed the young woman with a reminiscent smile . " His comments on long journeys were such that I fled the house . " She stood up , glancing in an amused fashion from Alain to David , and walked over to the young American . He was still staring glumly at Chardon 's dewy-lipped maiden . " It was selfishness that prompted my criticism of your prints , David , " she explained . " The young ladies are charming enough in their way but I possess several engravings that I desire to see upon your walls . Will you come and get them ? " Before David could answer , Alain broke in . " Oh , excellent ! " he exclaimed . " As I must consult with your father tomorrow , Mlle. Anne-Marie , I will secure them myself . " " Yes , " added David , " Alain will . . . " " I can not bear to think of those empty faces watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman with a faint petulance in her voice . " I desire you to come this evening , David , and accept my engravings . And you must hang them immediately . Alain evidently has missions of his own to occupy him or he would not have suggested turning over M. Pic 's memorandum to me. "  | " No , " began Alain in a surprised voice , and then some instinct caused him to relinquish his protest . Ile did not feel inclined to tell Anne-Marie that his tentatively-put suggestion that she take the memorandum to Louis-David was merely occasioned by his desire to have a free evening with the young American ( luring which he could discuss a phenomenal man named Danton . Well , there would be plenty of evenings in which to talk about the burly giant of the Cordeliers quarter . His brief disappointment vanished as quickly as it had come . " The idea is perfect , " he agreed . " Go , David , and procure these priceless treasures and I shall help you hang them before we sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to the house in the Rue des Perles was to him and he was a little embarrassed at the heartiness of his assent . Anne-Marie wanderedaimlessly toward the door . " If you are consulting with my father tomorrow , Alain , " she said , " I must warn you to come early . My father is going to court with M. de Montmorin to have audience with the King . " " If nine is not too early . . . " began Alain . " It will be perfect , " replied the young woman . " The audience at the Tuileries is set for eleven . " She was looking at several objects that David had spread out on the escritoire . " I should like very much to have an audience with the King , " remarked the American suddenly . " I recently suggested it to Mr. Gouverneur Morris but as he has not secured one himself yet . . . " " It could be arranged , " asserted Anne-Marie . " You have merely to broach the subject to my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vicq-d'Azyr . . . " She broke off and picked up a small object from the escritoire . " What a curiously simple little thing , " she declared , holding it out so that David could see it . It was a small Colonial snuff-box of black wood with a detachable cover upon which was painted a little man in Continental regimentals . David had discovered it in his luggage with some surprise , for , as he detested snuff , he had never collected snuff-boxes . It was possible that during his hasty packing in New York he had inadvertently picked it up from his dead father 's writing table . " Does it please you ? " he asked in an eager voice . " If so , pray take it in exchange for the engravings . " Anne-Marie glanced from the snuff-box to his swarthy face , started to shake her head and then carefully put the tiny container into the silken hag she carried.  | " I accept it with pleasure , " she said . " And now I must go before you force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " David , foolishly delighted that she had taken the snuff-box , bowed over her extended hand and followed her to the door . " Conte at eight , if you will , " she said , " and share a slice of small mutton and a bottle of claret with me . " He murmured his thanks . Alain handed her the folded memorandum which he had secured from M. Ambroise Pic of the Rue de la Harpe and kissed the tips of her fingers . Then he ran down the stairs ahead of her to procure a fiacre . David stood for a moment staring at the spot where the snuff-box had lain while the smile of farewell faded from his lips . It seemed to him that the rustle of Anne-Marie 's skirts still sounded in the room . For some unanalysable reason the reluctance to call at the house on the Rue des Perles had quite vanished from his mind . He could not say now what little imp of doubt had possessed him for the past month but he was certain that it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was all , a vapour that the long journey from Tressillac had created . And now it was dissipated . He would make his excuses to Louis-David that very evening when he called for the engravings . Ah , engravings ! He stirred suddenly and walked across the room and carefully removed Chardon 's simpering maiden from the wall . While he was placing it , face downward , on the table Alain returned and stood in the doorway watching him , a faint smile on his lips . David moved determinedly toward another picture . " David , " said Alain as he came into the room and flung himself into the chair so recently vacated by Anne-Marie , " I want to talk to you . Do you remember the man Danton I spoke to you about in Tressillac ? I have seen him again . I wonder . . . " " Do you suppose these frames are of sufficient size for the engravings ? " broke in David in a sudden anxiety . " If not , it will be impossible to have them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Alain patiently . " But . . . speaking of Danton . . . " " Yes . . . Danton , " said David absently as he removed another print from the wall . " What about Danton ? Who is he ? "  | THE HOUSE at number ten , Rue des Perles , was small and ancient and seemed cramped between the more impressive buildings set in high-walled , weed-choked gardens that flanked it on either side . One entered a shallow pebbled court through a coach entrance and found a stable on the left and a caretaker 's lodge on the right . Both of these structures were wings of the main building , the ensemble forming a square U that was twice as broad at the base as it was on the sides . Three long foot-hollowed steps of weathered stone led to the main entrance . This opened into a hall with a salon on one side and a dining-room on the other . At the rear was a broad flight of stairs leading to the upper quarters . The Marquis de Meyracq had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fallen sick at Metz , had received the name Bien-Aime from his perturbed and terrified city of Paris ; but since the death of that self-willed King , in 1774 , the marquis had seldom resided in it . He was more comfortableleading the retired life of a small seigneur at Carquefou . The house , therefore , bore a drab , unlived-in appearance and the furnishings were exceedingly sparse . When Jean-Antoine , whose naturally imperturbable face flickeredinto a smile of welcome , ushered David into the salon he found Louis-David Couetus , the Marquis de Meyracq and Anne-Marie comfortably seated before a blazing log fire in the high funnel-topped chimney . Louis-David rose immediately to greet him and as David clasped the nobleman 's hand he observed a subtly-changed physiognomy . It was still the face of Louis-David but a series of little lines about the eyes and mouth and a spreading of the white patches on the temples testified to the mental stress that was aging the Seigneur of Tressillac . Louis-David might still be standing up sturdily to the buffets of misfortune but they were leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greetings of Louis-David his eyes strayed curiously to the other occupants of the room . The little Marquis de Meyracq , hunched gloomily before the fire , had changed not at all and David supposed that he was too old to change . He was like a small withered apple that would merely crumble into dust some day . Anne-Marie was garmented in a fuchsia-coloured gown of the material called Jouy and she carried the daring hue with a success that made it peculiarly her own . The young man was quite certain that he had never seen her more beautifuland it was with a sensation of actual embarrassment , as though he was approaching a fragile flower , that he bowed over her hand . He was convinced that Alain was the most fortunate youth on earth . " You are a young deserter , " remarked Louis-David , tapping him affectionately on the shoulder . " But there , I will say nothing of it . Come and sit here with us and have a glass of wine while we attend supper . " The heat from the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy loving dog as he sat down opposite the little marquis . Jean-Antoine moved mincingly about the room lighting the candles in their gryphon-clawed holders . Louis-David 's uncle lifted his birdlike visage and glowered amicably across the dancing light . " Before God , the Virgin Mary , Our Saviour and all the hierarchiesof angels , " he said , " where are your foul American principles leading us ? " " You promised , " exclaimed Anne-Marie reproachfully . " So I did , " agreed the Marquis de Meyracq . " Well , let it go . He would n't know , anyway . How are you , young man ? " " I am in excellent health , monsieur , " replied David ; " I trust you are as well ? " " I have a separate rheum in every bone in my body , " declared the marquis , " and as our chirurgeons tell us that there are two hundred and . . . " " Uncle ! " said Anne-Marie in a reproving tone . " Riding in diligences all the way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn it all to hell ! " He shuddered grotesquely at the thought of his own misfortunes and the gesture was as unconsciously comical as it was convincingly miserable . Jean-Antoine , stepping softly , passed heavy goblets of rosecolouredAnjou wine and David , sipping appreciatively , endeavoured to converse calmly with Louis-David while he gazed with **33;3871;TOOLONG at Anne-Marie . He did not feel calm at all . A mysterious elixir of pleasure , which was not the wine , flowed through his body and stirred his heart to a rapid beating . Once more he was experiencing that sensationof being where he most desired to be that had surprised him so at the Chateau de Tressillac during the first weeks of his sojournp211there . He regretted now the long period of his abstention from appearing in this house and he found it impossible to explain to himselfwhy he had stayed away . The tiny demon of perversity that had arbitrarily closed the door of number ten , Rue des Perles , to him was an inexplicable and wicked adviser . For nothing at all had changed beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before and here were three people possessed by a new gravity that had aged them , but the spirit of welcome , o f spontaneous acceptance , of unflawed familiarity was the same . A curious thought slipped into his mind . Perhaps it was his own feeling of potential insecurity that had stood like an invisible barrier between him and this family , a feeling that he was going to change and he must not permit it to disturb the fine balance of relationship that so tacitly existed . And that was a curious thought , for he could not say why he might have changed . Anyway , the cloudy spell was past . He put down the empty goblet and listened smilingly to LouisDavid'slightly-spun account of a visit to Martinique immediately after the American War of Independence . It was obvious that the troubled state of affairs in France was not to be discussed this evening and he was glad of it . A few hours respite from this endlesstopic was like an agreeable tonic . He supposed that soldiers resting in their camps before battle talked of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the actual state of affairs and he was certain that he knew why . Even the birdlike Marquis de Meyracqhad uncoiled from his grotesque hunched shudder with a glance of half-querulous apology at Anne-Marie and with a waspish humourwas enlarging on the unbelievable customs of the blacks in Martinique . They were all gallantly closing a door to a disarrayed chamber in Time for the moment and contentedly existing in a haven , lighted by logs and rosy wine , that belonged uniquely to themselves . The Marquis de Meyracq , who had diverted his narrative of how the blacks stole metal tubs from the whites and carried them off into the forests there to pound out ceremonial dances before their outrageous gods to several scathing references to Tascher de la Pagerie 's daughter , Josephine , who had married the Vicomte de Beauharnais , interrupted his gossip suddenly and turned to AnneMarie . " Are we to have no music ? " he demanded . " You know how it enlarges my appetite . " She was sitting very close to the fire and the reflection of the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will play with pleasure , " she said , " but would you not rather converse ? "  |p212Her  long grey-green eyes turned reflectively to David 's face . " Play , by all means , " answered Louis-David . " I have been unawareuntil this moment that music is an appetizer , but my uncle appears to be a testimony to its virtues . " " I have no appetite when I am cross , " explained the marquis , " and I am always cross when the dinner hour approaches and I reflect on the delightful dishes I can no longer eat . It is then that music smooths out my mind . " Anne-Marie moved slowly toward the clavecin . The Marquis de Meyracq , old-fashioned in all things , scorned that fairly-recent invention , the pianoforte . He considered it peculiarly German and English and preferred the descendant of the epinette . " What shall I play for you ? " Anne-Marie asked David over her shoulder . " Shall it be Monsigny , Duni , Philidor or Gretry ? " The young man shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clavecin . She seemed to him like a strange miraculous-petalled flower blown across the tessellated floor . The candle-flare on her hair was like secret little flames . " What you will , " he said . He knew nothing of music and the only name that popped into his head was Pergolesi . His mother used to play one of the airs of Serpina from La Serva Padrona . " Stizzoso , mio stizzoso , voi fate it borioso . . . " " Rameau , " announced Anne-Marie , sitting down to the clavecin . She played Le Rappel des Oiseaux . The three men leaned back in their chairs and listened , each accepting the music in his own way and letting his thoughts drift with the struck notes . For the Marquis de Meyracq , very small in his large chair , these notes , so lightly struck , carried him into what he fervently believed to have been a better clay , a time when the sun seemed to shine eternally upon Versailles  --  and that was before the Bien-Aime gasped his last while the torrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the perturbed Dubarry , whisperingwhite-lipped to d'Aiguillon , rolled away to Rueil  --  and the red heels in the Gil-de-beeuf clacked on the polished floor while the gentlemen-in-waiting opened the precious doors and admitted the lucky few . There was music then , gay , sprightly , delicately formalized , to which all might dance who bore a Name . But it was all gone , superseded by a strident and discordant earthquake of sound that came from neither clavecins nor epinettes nor virginals nor viols but from unpainted sabots of cracked larch hammering on skull-like cobbles . The Marquis de Meyracq , his eyes closed and his little claw tugging at his underlip , listened to the old melodies.  |p213So  , too , did Louis-David Couetus . But he , more instructed in the history of lovely sounds , saw pass through his reverie a graciousprocession of shadowy-eyed men , the masters who made that music to which the old France had ( lanced and sung and made love and dreamed . Josquin Despres , Janequin , Roland de Lassus , Costeley , Claudin Le Jeune , Cambert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsigny , Philidor , Gretry , Franconian Gluck , Piccini , Maul , all that fastidious galaxy who might have stepped off the fans and screens of Watteau and Fragonard and Carle Vanloo and who caught in the fragile webs of their melodies a sensuous world that was like a softly-swaying rainbow-hued bubble in the grey arcane of Time . For Louis-David , unspoilt by campaignsand laborious days , worshipped the charming bel esprit of his ancestors and savoured it sweetly in this music . Anne-Marie began to sing in a low blurred voice that was like a soft moon-shot mist . She sang the soprano part from Mignonne . . . allons voir si la rose . . . by Costeley of Evreux . David heard and did not hear the words of Ronsard . He was aware only of Anne-Marie 's hands moving over the keys , of her dark red hair catching the glittering fiery spear-points of the candles and the watery reflections of her gown . If there was a world outside the windows ( and the almost doubted it ) it was very far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell of Putnam , Greene and Van Tyne 's warehouse with its pleasant mingled odour of molasses , tobacco , coffee and spices . He was in an oasis where there was no past to slide snakelike across one 's mind , no procession of impalpable figures to march invisibly through the candlelight , no disquieting reflections to shake the unalterable peace . This was perfection . This was what life should be . He had already forgottenthat he once possessed misgivings , scruples , whatever they might be , about venturing for a second time into this charmed circle . He was a part of it now as he had always been a part of it . . . even before he knew that it existed . The music changed . Anne-Marie began to play softly , " 0 Richard ! o most roil l'univers t'abandonne ! " Louis-David 's chair scraped as he stood up . " Not that , " he said . " Not that tonight , my dear . " Jean-Antoine appeared in the doorway announcing dinner . During the weeks that followed his first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of a subtly increasing shift in the warm intimacy that existed between him and Alain . It was not at all occasioned by any cooling of affection but rather by an arbitrarydivergence of the ways their instinctive inclinations led them . Alain , still ostensibly the secretarial aid to Louis-David , disappeared oftener and oftener into the complicated web of streets on the left bank of the Seine . He was no longer satisfied to pass his evenings in the Rue Vivienne or the Rue des Perles and when he did so an obvious restlessness pervaded him and transformed him into an inattentive companion . His mind was elsewhere . David surmised the reason for this change in his friend but his own hours were so occupied that it did not trouble him at all . Of course , it was that man Danton whom Alain stumblingly praised from time to time , that burly fellow who represented the Cordeliers quarter in the Assemblee Communale of Paris and whose bull-like voice was preaching a new doctrine of equality and liberty . All that David knew about Danton he gathered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of the man . Alain was too incoherent and repetitious . It did not occur to David that perhaps he was too uninterested . Neither did it occur to him that his own shifted progression since his first visit to the house in the Rue des Perles was as much responsibleas Danton for the changed relationship with Alain . He , too , was no longer to be found nightly in the Rue Vivienne eagerly awaitinghis friend for long-drawn-out discussions or aimless prowlings through the badly-lighted streets . Having once ventured the way to Louis-David 's habitation it speedily became a custom . He was as restless as Alain when a realization of the proportions of friendshiprestrained him at home ; and the sight of the new prints upon his wall ( prints he had carefully brought home sheltered beneath his coat on that first rainy March night ) were a constant reminder of where he desired to be . For Alain it was the cafes of the Cordeliersquarter and the resonant voice of a new hero ; for David it was the Rue des Perles and two white hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men encountered each other with a kindling affection that was in no wise dimmed . Indeed , if it had not been for the house in the Rue des Perles David 's time , now that Alain 's enthusiasm led him elsewhere , would have hung heavy on his hands . He knew practically nobody in Paris . Gouverneur Morris was in London , dining with Mr. Fox , waiting on the Duke of Leeds and attending the trial of Warren Hastings . And Mr. Paine was in London , too , worrying about his iron bridge and composing a long letter to General Washington with which he proposed to send the key of the Bastille , that useless bit of iron having been entrusted to him by Lafayette for this pur/pose . There were the daily phenomena of Paris , of course , to interest the young American but these matters were discussed in the house in the Rue des Perles , which , after all , could not constantly maintain its status as a haven out of disjointed Time . The news of the day broke through the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marquis de Meyracq it was a period wherein he ceased to exist as a human being but lingered on , a querulous littleghost , crouched in his chair and spitting phantom words at the rushing tide of events . " They have abolished me , " he informed David on the evening of the day that the National Assembly , with an inconsequence truly prodigious , voted Chapelier 's decree suppressing all titles , armorial bearings , liveries and knightly orders , " I beg you not to mistake me for a man . I am only an anachronism suffering from indiges-tion . " Louis-David was neither malign nor hysterical . He saw that the preponderating bourgeoisie revolutionnaire in the National Assemblywas determined on a passive king , a stuffed figure that could be pulled hither and thither and pounded into any shape that the leaders desired . Since the mad night of August fourth and its immediate consequences , the seizure of all church properties and the Civil Constitution of the clergy , he had expected this abolition of the Nobility . Therefore , when it came it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings in the house in the Rue des Perles , heard the rushing tide through the gentle music of the clavecin . Alain heard it to a louder music . The magnetism , sheerly physical at first , that had drawn him to Danton was now permeating his mind and the propagandist utterancesof the rhetor , so like the blows of a sledge-hammer on the reasoning faculties , were stunning his intelligence and transforminghim into an automaton directed by a will outside of itself . He was acquainted with Danton now . He had conversed with him , or , rather , had listened to Danton 's conversation , and his malleable nature , subdued and acquiescent , had responded with alacrity . It was , without his knowing it , the old tale of the dominating spirit confounding and subjugating the feebler personality . The attractionthat had drawn him to Danton , that sensation of being in contact with trees and rocks and thunder , with gross essential life itself , had speedily grown into a sort of minor mystic religion of which Danton was the prophet and the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of the rhe- tor 's opinions on the tangled affairs of the day . He became persuadedthat he was a commoner , something that he had never thought much about before , and that as a commoner his place was in the battle-lineof the Commons . He did not quite envisage that battle-line but he began to see the Revolution as a great cleansing process that must culminate in an inevitable Utopia . Matters that had formerly interested him not at all suddenly loomed large through Danton 's reasoning , and , therefore , in his own mind . This abrupt change , which was not so unusual in a young man barely across the threshold of manhood , was understandable enough in itself for the very air of the times was impregnated with suddenshifts and unexpected currents . While mature men were starkly shedding themselves of the opinions of a lifetime , it was not strange that a young man with no opinions at all should so implicate himself in the rushing tides of the day . Alain was caught up because he was unformed and because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with David about Danton and the reasons for this were foggy in his own mind . He had intended to discuss his new-found idol long and seriously with the American but AnneMarie'sfirst visit to the rooms in the Rue Vivienne had postponed what appeared to have been a happy occasion , and that very evening , while David was dining with the Seigneur of Tressillac , he had actually met Danton in the Cafe Procope , talked to him , listened to him , partaken of refreshments with him and fallen irremediably under the spell of his sonorous voice . Then , so much gained , he had decided to know more of Danton before he discussed him with David . After that , matters had drifted . He was hardly conscious that he was seeing very little of David and Anne-Marie and that was because he was so caught up in his new occupation of willing listener and large-eyed worshipper . LouisDavidCouetus 's affairs required hardly any attention from him now and his visits to the house in the Rue des Perles became less frequent . Louis-David was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consultation with the King and the expedition of his funds to England had been accomplished . Alain , therefore , was practically free to haunt the Left Bank , the Cafe Procope , even Danton 's house in the Cour du Commerce where the charming Gabrielle endeavoured futilely to keep her husband 's neckclothproperly folded about his big neck , and imbibe the revolutionaryopinions that made that district a tempest of plain speaking . He was too absorbed to miss either David or Anne-Marie , and , indeed , if he had been squarely asked , he would have asserted that he could hardly miss friends whom he had never deserted . Afterp217all , they were still there , one in the Rue Vivienne and the other in the Rue des Perles . If a wedge of strangeness was being driven between him and the friend he adored and the woman he worshipped he was , as yet , unaware of it . The rainy spring merged into a hot summer and life seemed very full and exciting and compact with promise for Alain . On the Champ-de-Mars they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille . A vast amphitheatre , with a high altar in its midst at which the entire nation from the King and the National Assembly to the numberless delegations of National Guards , the Federes from the eighty-three new departments into which France had been sliced , was to swear a civic oath of fidelity to the Constitution , was in process of erection . The unreasonable element in solemnly affirming fealty to a Constitution that was not completed and , therefore , an unknown quantity apparently did not impress itself on the overexcited populace . There were not enough workmen to complete the digging in time and popular enthusiasm ( for Paris was a shifting sea of alternate enthusiasms and desperations ) aroused the general public , the vociferous masses that coursed the streets , to aid in these hasty labours . The curious visitor pausingby this vast expanse of open land might observe an astonishing mixture of people , both men and women , busily engaged with pick and shovel and barrow , garlands of flowers about their necks and mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Palais-Royal indulged their congenital love of sharp antithesis in asserting that abbes , monks , nuns , duchesses , marquises and magistrates were wielding spades and picks in the huge enclosure but this was an exaggeration . It was the bourgeoisie , the booksellers , fishmongers , lawyers ' clerks , coalheavers and the multitude of unemployed , who dug away lustily in the summer sun . Alain and other habitues of the Cafe Procope ( at the suggestion of Danton , of course ) passed some time in excavating the Champdc-Mars . To the young man this communal effort became a thrilling spectacle , an exhibition of ardent patriotism , and as he turned up the fresh smoking earth he felt himself coming closer to the will and purpose of his idol . His spade rang against the stones while through his mind pealed the name , Danton , Danton , Danton , like a bell , like the great bell of **25;3906;TOOLONG . There was nothing like the dizzy odour of newly-turned soil to arouse one 's fierce love of the land and the gnarled hordes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was insuperable . It was so he toiled during the day and listened throughout the evening andp218looked forward auspiciously to attending the dinner that Danton , with a happy perspicacity , planned for all the Federes billeted in the Cordeliers quarter . Danton glanced happily down the long table . A boisterous gatheringthat the torrents of rain outside failed to suppress laughed , screamed and gesticulated before him . The feted Federes in their damp blue coats with white lapels and red piping masticated noisily , sucked their neglected tusks and upset their wineglasses on the stained cloths . The close air , blue from the smoke of pipes , throbbed with half a dozen varying dialects . It did not matter to Danton that these men ate like pigs and reasoned like asses ; he saw in them a vast inchoate mass that might be moulded into something that would awe the world . And that something , that vision that was endlessly formulating itself in his active brain , brought forth an anticipatory smile upon his bold scarred features . It had not been without forethought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wiser to feed the stomach of a nation than to scratch its head . With men of such kidney as those before him he could mix and it was time that France knew the name of Georges-Jacques Danton . It was time for France to see beyond the bugle-nose of Lafayette , the pockmarked Mirabeau , the discreditedNecker , the helpless Louis XVI and the dozen enfeebled. rhetors who endeavoured to compromise with uncompromising facts . It was time for a strong man to step upon the scene . The pleased giant turned his great head from the guzzling Federes and inspected the features of his immediate entourage , those men who were his intimates and with whom he proposed to tear France apart and put it together again according to his own plans . They were seated on either side of him . There was the sallowmask of Camille Desmoulins , his long black curls shaken over his collar ; the idealistic versifier , Marie-Joseph Chenier ; the comic writer , Fabre d'Eglantine ; the grave-faced Stanislas Freron ; the martial-minded printer , Brune ; the law-clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , Vinot , Billaud , Momoro and Chaumette . Why , there was a future government here as yet unhatched from its monstrous egg , a regiment of brains and ideals of which he , Georges-Jacques Danton , was the animating force . Let the muddy-booted Federes , come by coach and foot from the four corners of France , from Dauphine and Bretagne and Anjou and Touraine and Franche-Comte and Beam , look upon these faces  --  and particularly upon his own  --  and understand that there was more to national unity than bawling " Long live the King ! "  |p219in  the midst of a torrential downpour . Long live the King , indeed ! For the moment silent , his luminous eyes darting from face to face , his hamlike hands clenched in some secret satisfaction , Danton leaned back in his chair and listened to the babel of wine-loosed voices , to the fragments of speech that clashed in the fetid air. " . . . and the rain . . . " " . . . curse it . . . the Champ-de-Mars . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the priests at the altar looked like drowned pigeons . . two hundred of them . . .

" " Lafayette 's plume . . . like a rat 's tail . . . " " . . . and did you regard the Dauphin in his little National Guard uniform . . . " " . . . the Queen 's nose . . . all wet . . . " The thin-faced young man with the large dark eyes was smiling at Danton , so the idol of the Cordeliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It pleased the master of the feast to observe intelligent-appearing young men taking a lively interest in public affairs . Now that boy there . . . Gendron ? . . . no , no , Gihon . . . was sensitive and enthusiastic . . . just the type to . . . and an absolute hero worshipper , too . Danton lifted his great hand and beckoned . The young man came hastily around the table and wedged himself in between Danton and Camille Desmoulins . " You were present on the Champ-de-Mars , " remarked Danton more as a statement than a question . " I was , " answered Alain , " and even the rain could not destroy the majesty of the spectacle . " " No , no , " agreed the rhetor reflectively . " The elements werepowerless against this inspired force that we call the people . " He glanced down the long table where the Federes laughed andshouted . " We must become better acquainted , " he said . " There is work for us to do together . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They have talked of the stupidity of the masses , " said Danton , and iii. , ' e was intense scorn in his pronunciation of the pronoun . " Now we must speak in our turn of the stupidity of the leaders . We must see to it that the Revolution is not betrayed by compromisingand conspiring jackanapes in high office . The scene begins to shift and the issue is increasingly plain . By half-hearted methods we will lose all that we are grasping for and that must not happen . Today , this first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille , is a day of beginnings for France . " The sallow face of Camille Desmoulins , who had been listening , thrust forward and speech burst from him in a stuttering stumble . " Today ! " he exclaimed . " Today is the day of liberation from servitude in Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea ! It is the first day of the first year of liberty ! It is the day predicted by the prophet Ezekiel , the day of destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung out his arm vigorously in an emphatic gesture and his elbow , striking a wine goblet , knocked it over . The crimson contentsspurted across the table like a stream of blood . " The colour of liberty , " remarked Fabre d'Eglantine dryly as he dipped his finger in the spilled wine and started to trace his name on one of the rare white sections of the table-cloth . " I must write an Ode to Red . " The Federes were singing a new song called ( ' a ira and the group about Danton paused in their conversation to listen . Alain heard the melody with a queer prickling in his scalp . his shoulder was crushed against Danton 's massive arm and it seemed to him that a throbbing fluid , a fluid like the beat of the music , poured from the rhetor into his own lean body . lle was charged with that mysteriouselectrical element and it carried him along with Danton , with Camille Desmoulins , with Fabre d'Eglantine , with the baying-voiced Federes , with the rushing tide of France itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elixir of hope flowing through all that mass of people , half a million said some , who had gathered in the glacial wind and stabbing rain on the Champ-de-Mars , and , with snarling drums , thudding salvoes , shaken swords and pikes , shrill cries , hats flung in the air and the eighty-three white banners of the departments , taken the Civic Oath to defend the Constitution ? If it was , then this could be no other than the Day of Beginning . As for himself , he was helpless , and willing to be helpless , in this rolling wave of ardour that was like all the pounding billows of the Atlantic merged into one . Danton was struggling to his feet.  | " No ! " he cried in his great voice . " Let us have no healths by order ! " A Norman officer of Federes had raised his goblet to toast the King . Danton seized the nearest bottle of wine and smashed the head off it against the table . " No healths by order ! " he repeated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us today ! La Patrie ! " Alain was swept to his feet like all the others by this compelling command and as he fumbled dazedly for a goblet he could hear the drums of the sixty districts beating in the rain outside.  |p222AUGUST  . Dry throat-clutching heat wherein the clouds of midgesspun in endless fluttering dance above the open drains . Everywhere the bright new uniforms of M. de Lafayette'sNational Guard and the abrupt flickers of the rapidly-expiring patriotic enthusiasm engendered by the Feast of Federation . There were voices that still cried , " Long live the King ! " There were other voices too . David , close at the heels of M. Couetus , entered the Tuileries by the door to the Queen 's Staircase which opened on an angle of the Cour du Carrousel near the Pavilion de Fiore . They mounted to the rez-de-chaussee where Marie-Antoinette 's apartments were located and continued up a farther flight of steps to the first floor . Here was a long corridor upon which opened the various chambers of the King , and David , his heart beating rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armed guards , officers , servants , noblemen and privileged hangers-on . For the fourth time since he had entered the chateau the Seigneur of Tressillac presented his card of admittanceto an officer in attendance and was about to proceed along the congested corridor with David pressing self-consciously behind him when a nearby door opened and a gentleman in black silk breeches and flaring-skirted coat appeared . " M. Couetus , " exclaimed this gentleman , " you had best come through here and avoid being crushed to death . " The Seigneur of Tressillac grasped David 's arm and drew him with him into the small oblong antechamber where the gentleman in black silk stood . This individual immediately closed the door on the hubbub in the corridor . " M. he Comte de Montmorin , " said Louis-David , " let me present my young American friend , David Livingston , whom the King has kindly consented to receive . " M. de Montmorin fastened a sharp glance on David . " How do you do , sir , " he said in English and appeared immediately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David felt as though he had been blown out like a candle.  | " This way , " continued M. de Montmorin as he turned on his rather high heel . The three men passed through a narrow door in the antechamber near the window that overlooked the Cour du Carrousel and crossed a room wherein were seated several women engaged in embroidering on frames . It was , Louis-David murmured , the chamber of the ladies-in-waiting of Madame Royale . Then , in order , they traversed the bedchamber of Madame Royale , the bedchamber of the Dauphin and the bedchamber of the King . Louis-David , still speaking in a hushed voice , explained that all of the royal family , except the King , were in Saint-Cloud . They found their privacy less disturbed there . M. de Montmorin threw open the door that led from the King 's bedchamberto the chambre de parade and there David for the first time stood face to face with Louis XVI . The King had just turned from a window that overlooked the crowded Cour du Carrousel and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grey silk and white stockings , his pudgy hand raised and sulkily pulling at his loose underlie . As David gazed at the perplexed eyes , the bold arched nose , the broad lips and swelling double chin an instantaneous impression of a slightly pouting shopkeeper in a place where he did not desire to be crossed his mind . This was the second time that the American had seen the King . The first had been that day in July last year when he had observed the royal coach passing along the Rue Saint-Honore from the window he shared with Mr. Gouverneur Morris . But he had seen nothing then but a fleshy bulk in shadow and the turning flash of a featureless face , a blob of pallid fat in a lowered window . Now he could gaze full upon this man who concentred in himself the violent detestation , suspicious regard and theoretical affection of disorientatedFrance . The barrel-like figure seemed a precarious peg on which to hang the fortunes of the nation . As Louis-David Couetus bowed over the monarch 's hand , the possessor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hawking sound and glanced , first , expressively at the door to the corridor and , secondly , at M. de Montmorin . The comte reluctantly hacked away . " There are matters , perhaps . . . " he began in a protesting voice . " Leave us , " said the King in a flat phlegmatic tone . The door opened on a minor hurricane of voices and scraping feet and then closed abruptly . " It is a pleasure to see you , M. Couetus , " announced Louis in the comparative silence that succeeded the closed door.  |p224He  glanced incuriously at David . " And this young man . . . " he remarked tentatively . Louis-David presented the American and the King stared glassily at him as he proffered his plump white womanlike hand . It felt absolutely boneless . " It is a pleasure to see your Majesty in such excellent health , " said the young man as he lifted his head . " What ? Oh , yes , " mumbled Louis . " My health is well enough although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would desire the health of France to be no worse . In America . . . I have heard . . . " His voice died away as he lost all interest in what he was saying , and he tugged automatically at his underlip . There was the dull thud of a musket-butt on the floor outside the door . The King opened and shut his mouth several times like a blase fish wearily aware of an untempting bait . He scratched his ear vigorously . David suspected that his mind was obsessed with a particular subjectthat rendered him incapable of the usual polite small talk . " You are a Vendeen , M. Couetus , " he said presently , " and , therefore , a faithful child of our Mother Church . What reactions do you think this new civil constitution for the Clergy will arouse in your corner of France ? " There was a querulous anxiety in the unexpected question . So that was it . Louis-David opened his mouth to speak but said no more than " Sire " when the King lumbered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned , the two men followed him . The sleeping-chamber was a fairly small room with an alcove wherein stood the canopied bed . In the wall beside the bed was pierced a judas that overlooked the Dauphin 's quarters and beyond this judas , set in the black wood of the panelling , was a small armoire de fer , an iron cupboard to which the King passed . He unlocked it with a key which he produced from his swelling waistcoat . After fumbling for some time through what appeared to be stacked piles of correspondence and dossiers he drew forth a letter with a grunt of satisfaction . " Here it is , " he said in a tone implying that the two attendant men had been quite aware of what he was seeking . He read the letter through and then handed it to Louis-David . The American appeared to have ceased to exist for him.  | " From Msgr. the Bishop of Autun , " remarked Louis-David in some surprise as he studied the letter . " I was not aware that your Majesty was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " I have many correspondents , " he said , " who would not care to be known at large as such . " His eyes flickered toward the armoire de ter . " What do you think of the letter ? " he added in a tone of mixed curiosity and vexation . Louis-David handed it back to him with the gingerly gesture of a fastidious man presenting a dead mouse . " It is not the letter of a churchman , " he replied . " It is the letter of a conniving scoundrel who seeks to establish himself with both sides at once . I would not trust M. de Talleyrand-Perigord . " David suddenly recalled the lame prelate who had described the fantastic menagerie of the National Assembly to him in the Breton Club in Versailles more than a year before . A fox , a veritable fox . The King crumpled up the letter and shoved it into the pocket of his skirted coat with a discouraged gesture . " I no longer trust anyone , " he said morosely . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decree , now in process of formation in the Assembly , commanding all clerics to swear an oath of fidelity to the new Civil Constitution . Well . . . " He paused and blew out his lips . " M. Couetus , " he began again . " You are a good Roman Catholic . T can speak of this matter to you . We have discussed these things before . What is this Civil Constitution but an arbitrary deliverance of the Church to the mercy and caprices of an unstable civil government ? I tell you , monsieur , that the violence to my conscience paralyses me . " His voice rose in unexpected vigour , and , instinctively , he stared about the chamber as though he feared a concealed listener . " In decreeing , " he went on , " that by its sole and peculiar authority the bishops should govern dioceses over which Mother Church has given them no power the National Assembly has arrogated to itself the spiritual dominance which the Church received directly from Jesus Christ , its Founder . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemy , " said Louis-David in a low voice . " A great blasphemy , indeed ! " cried the King with a liveliness that seemed alien to him . " The Church is a perfect society , established and constituted by the Son of God himself under a form not democraticbut monarchic . Its visible head is the Sovereign Pontiff , the Bishop of Rome , who received his Divine Mission  --  in the person of St. Peter  --  of shepherd , that is to say , governor of the sheep , who are the bishops , and of the lambs , who are the simple faithful . How , then , can a motley body of electors  --  Protestants , schismatics , Greeks , Mohammedans , Jews and free-thinkers ( for the decree of Decembertwenty-fourth , seventeen-eighty-nine , admits them all in full equality )  --  elect our bishops and cures ? How can the Assembly , not content with seizing all church properties , suppress fifty-three archbishopricsand delimitate the dioceses of one hundred and twenty others  --  which it did when it rearranged France into eighty-three departments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to observe the ardour that suddenly transformed this richly-garmented phlegmatic body into quivering remonstrance . " Is the proposed oath formulated ? " inquired Louis-David . The King shook his head . " No , monsieur , but its principles have been enunciated . The oath will impose not only the obligation of being faithful to the Nation  --  that equivocal term , the Law and the King , but of sustaining with all the cornered cleric 's power a constitution incompatible with the doctrine of the Church . " " You can withhold your Royal Sanction from both the Civil Constitutionand the Oath , " declared Louis-David . The King 's ardour collapsed like a pricked balloon . " And plunge the country into civil war , " he added . " I expected better advice from you , M. Couctus . " " The masses of the people are still faithful to their King , " said Louis-David stoutly . Louis tugged at his underlie . " So were they on the fourteenth of July and the fifth of October , " he replied with gloomy irony .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American noticed that the stoutness was ebbing from the seigneur'svoice . " The regiments , " stated the King distinctly , " are eaten out with carefully-fostered discontent and treasonable opinions as an old cheese is eaten out by maggots . " He raised his plump hand . " The army ! " he exclaimed . " Are you not aware what has happened in the army during the last year ? " He began to count the regiments on his fingers . " The Lorraine Dragoons , " he informed his silent listeners , " pillagedthe regimental treasury and deposed their officers at Tarascon ;  |p227the  regiment of Auvergne mutinied at Quesnoy ; the Colonel-General at Lille ; Penthievre at Rennes ; Guyenne at Nimes ; Vivarais revolted between Bethune and Verdun because it desired to return to the comfortable garrison from which it had been ordered ; Vexin forced its officers to eat at the common mess ; Royal-Marine commanded its chiefs to go away ; Beaune demanded , under the pretext of due accounts , 11,000 livres ; Forez wanted 39,000 ; Poitou , 40,000 ; SalmSalm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touraine mutinied at Perpignan . . . " He paused breathless and cleared his thick throat of the phlegm that had gathered in it . " You see ? " he said after a moment . " The army is a rotting mass of continual disruption .

Prudhomme and his Revolutions de Paris , Marat and his Ami du Peuple and his Le Junius Francais , Loustalot and his pamphlets  --  I have seen and read them all . I am not blind behind these walls . I am only helpless . " He stopped abruptly and stared earnestly at Louis-David . " I can forgive them when they outrage my person , " he said finally . " I can even forgive them when they outrage the majesty of which God has made me the symbol . But when they outrage my conscience . . . a thing that is my own . . . I . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his features . Louis-David was bereft of speech . He stood stiffly before the King , a frown growing on his forehead although his eyes were misty with an emotion he made no attempt to conceal . " France ! France ! " exclaimed Louis bitterly . " Land of Francois and Henri and Charles ! " He put his hand familiarly on Louis-David 's shoulder . " I speak to you as a friend , " he said . " I have need of friends . I will have great need of them if all things go awry . And there are so few I can count upon . So few ! " " There are many , sire , " insisted Louis-David . " All the gentlemen of Vendee are your friends . " The King dropped his hand to his side . " We shall see , " he said .

And David was convinced that Louis had entirely forgotten him , the third person , the foreigner , the silent youth who stood unobtrusively near the door and observed how mazed unhappy kings could be . " Your Majesty . " A dry voice spoke across the American 's shoulder and he turned to gaze into the disapproving eyes of M. de Montmorin . " What is it , M. le Comte ?

Fresh breezes stirring the trees in the Cours-la-Reine and torchlightdances on the uneven stone-strewn expanse where the Bastille had stood . General rejoicing in the National Assembly where the news of Bouille 's drastic suppression of the regimental insurrection at Nancy momentarily insulated the lawmakers from " dolorous surprises . " Renewed offensives of the revolutionary press , that **27;3933;TOOLONG provocateur with a hundred screaming mouths . Rage of illiterate Prudhomme because the priests chanted in the Royal Chapel Domine salvum fac regent instead of Domine salvam fac gentem . David sat upright in his bed and smiled with genuine pleasure at the face of Alain which hung irresolutely in the doorway . " No , you have n't wakened me , " he said . " Come in . I want to make sure that I can still recognize you . " Alain walked across the chamber and sat down on the foot of the bed .

" There was a slightly thickened tone to his voice that caused David to study him speculatively for an instant  | " What time is it ? " the American asked . " Oh , about two or three , " responded Alain airily . " What do you mean about making sure that you can recognize me ? " David laughed softly . " It is so seldom I see you , " he replied . " Sometimes I hear you moving about in your chamber but that is when I chance to wake in the dead of night . What time do you generally conic home ? " Alain threw his head back and laughed . " It is the club , " he explained . " We meet every night and the conversation goes on into the early morning hours . As a matter of fact , David , I have lost all sense of time . I do come here at the dinner hour often enough but it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " I know , " said David . " I have been much in the company of M. Couetus . What club do you mean ? " " Oh , I call it the club , " replied Alain . " I mean the group that meets at Citizen Danton 's house . I wish you would come one evening . You would meet brilliant men and you would hear conversation that would astound you . David , you can not imagine what a great man Danton is or what a marvellous brain he has . That man is the saviour of France . " " Is he ? " inquired David dryly . " I thought M. de Mirabeau was the saviour of France . " " Mirabeau ? Ball ! " exclaimed Alain . " The so-called Torch of Provence is well-nigh extinguished . As a matter of fact M. Riquetti is under suspicion of underhand dealings with the Tuileries . I expectvery soon that Danton will ask for his dismissal . " " Really ! " said David . " Are you high in the councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the bed . " He discusses matters with me , " he replied proudly . " I will wager that I am aware of many things that are quite foreign to your con-ceptions . " For no reason at all David experienced a feeling of irritation . He drew up his legs with some abruptness . " I presume there is plenty of wine at M. Danton 's house , " he remarked inconsequently . " Saviour of France , indeed ! " went on Alain scornfully , rolling over on his back and shielding his eyes from the candlelight with his arm . " Every little babbler imagines that he is the saviour of France . I could name you a dozen of them . There is , for instance , that dry stick , Robespierre , who , in spite of his eighty discourses before the Assembly , continues to hide his light under the snuffer of obscurity . " He chuckled gleefully . " Do you know what we call him ? " he asked . " The Candle of Arras . That 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Provence ! Danton will blow them both out when he chooses . " " Danton must be a very great man , indeed , " said David , the fit of irritation unaccountably growing upon him . " He is , " declared Alain instantly . " He is the greatest man I have ever met . " It was on the tip of David 's tongue to say something biting about Alain 's experiences with great men but with an effort he kept the remark back . There was a moment 's silence . " Have you seen M. Couetus lately ? " inquired the American at last . " Who ? " asked Alain , his thoughts obviously elsewhere . " LouisDavid ? Oh , no . Not for a month . " He sat up and yawned . There was a red line across his cheek where his arm had pressed and a faintly glassy look in his eyes . " It is the National Assembly that must be watched , David , " he explained earnestly as though the American had asked his opinion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Assembly . There is always the danger of **28;3962;TOOLONG that damned camp at Jales , for instance  --  and compromisers and bought rascals . If we are to consolidate the position we have achieved we must look to our defences . " " We ! " said David in blank amazement . " Are you a revolutionist , Alain ? " " I am a patriotic Frenchman , " replied the young man sonorously . " Danton says . . . " " A few months ago you had neither interest nor knowledge of political matters , " broke in David . " A few months ago I was a boy , " declared Alain . " And now you think you are a man , " blurted out the other . Alain got up from the bed and stared down at David . For an instantthere was a ghost of anger in his eyes . " I suppose we may all grow up , " he said finally . " It is one of the laws of nature , is n't it ? " David reached out his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " he said . " I 'm half asleep and I do n't know what I am saying . " Alain laughed and sat down again on the bed . " Danton says that men grow up overnight in these times , " he explained.  |p231David  was quite sure that if he heard the name of Danton again he would scream . " I think you should see more of M. Couetus , " he remarked gravely . " I am very sure , too , that Anne-Marie misses your company . " Alain 's white teeth bit into his underlip . " I suppose I should , " he said slowly . " It has just been chance that has kept me away . That , and . . . " He stood up and walked slowly across the room . " Shall I blow out your candles ? " he asked . " Will you go with me tomorrow to the Rue des Perles ? " returned David . " I ca n't , " replied the other a trifle peevishly . " Danton has been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be away several days . " " When you return , then , " insisted David . " Of course , " agreed Alain . " As soon as I return . Shall I blow out the candles now ? " " Very well , " replied David . The room plunged into darkness . " Good night , David . " " Good night , Alain . " The door closed . David continued to sit bolt-upright in the bed . He was less sleepy than he pretended and more irritated than he realized . A gnawing sensation of dissatisfaction with Alain had plunged unexpectedly into his mind and it bewildered and disconcerted him . He was brought abruptly face to face with the disturbing fact that men change , grow , take various paths , outreach and outlive each other , part as friends and meet as strangers , achieve maturity in a flash and inexplicably forsake old ideals for new . Two men might live in intimate converse for unnumbered years and then a ten minutes ' conversation could divide them so that they were poles apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alain . It never could happen . Basically their relationship was unassailable . But on the surface . . . He stared into the darkness with puzzled sleeplesseyes . Why had that aggravating feeling of irritation set his nerves on edge while he listened to Alain ? What invisible barrier had sprung up between them so that their mental and spiritual union was no longer that perfection of understanding that had made them Kern like one mind ? Was it this burly man Danton who had raped Alain of his independent mentality or was it the humiliating fact that he , David Livingston , had ceased to develop in a time of developmentand been left woefully behind by his sealed companion ? He could shuffle the questions to and fro but he could devise no adequate answers to them . He could suspect , sense , surmise and wonder . . . that was all . Certain facts were clear enough . Alain had been drinking . Alain was acutely convinced that he was grown up . Alain was obsessed with a Purpose . Alain was a Revolutionist . Alain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought occurred to him . . . Alain seemed more like the brother of Yves Gihon than he had ever seemed before . And yet . . . and yet . . . He was nothing of the sort . The ancient magnetism that had drawn him to Alain was still as potent as the ancient distaste that had repelled him from Yves Gihon . After all , he was making too much of matters that were quite small . He was enlarging where there should be no enlargement , and that was always perilous to a friendship . Perhaps he was even jealous , jealous of Alain 's continuedabsences , of his hero worship of Danton , of the kindling ideas that drew him apart , of the very manhood that transformed him now from the youth who had walked along the yellow road toward Viroflay . It seemed curious that such jealousy should spring up like a wicked little fire eating at his peace of mind , but what else was there to think if he was to preserve his faith in Alain ? He must never forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callow youth merging into vibrant young manhood was taking place before his wiser eyes . It had been cruel of him to say " And now you think you are a man . " That had been no more than an eruption of his own callow youth . He would have to suppress that streak in him as he continued successfully to suppress so many other spontaneous urges that lurked behind his reticent facade . If Alain thought he was a Revolutionist . . . An irresistible yawn cut clearly across his thought like a great-bladed knife . He slid down into the bed and closed his eyes . Tomorrow he would forget all these mental trepidationsand . . . and . . . dine . . . Anne-Marie . . . October . Horses ' hoofs pounding the turf at Vincennes and the PalaisRoyala " perpetual enchantment " of rich displays and shouting orators .

" There were still some people who believed in pacific revolutions . They might just as well have been in the moon.  |p233Alain  was standing in the middle of the salon conversing with the Marquis de Meyracq . The shrivelled little nobleman was leaning forward , his tiny bird 's claw of a hand resting on the young man 's arm and his intent eyes , so like black shiny buttons sewed on brown leather , twisted up toward the youthful face . " You see how they have abolished me ? " the marquis was saying . " I am no longer de Meyracq . I am M. Couctus . But that is my nephew . And Montmorency has become Bouchard and Richelieu has become Vignerot and Breteuil has become Tonnelier and Vergenneshas become Gravier and Coigny has become Franquctot and Caraman has become Riquet . Do you see ? And I suppose Louis de France has become Capet . Is it not wonderful ? Your extraordinary Assembly has taken our names away with our privileges . " " I do not understand these matters , " said Alain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " David , sitting near the clavecin , was pleased to observe his friend 's determination to be drawn into neither argument nor rash statement . Alain was quite the old Alain , pleasant , reserved , retiring in demeanour and admirably attentive to his elders . He had picked up the thread of intercourse with the denizens of the house in the Rue des Perles where he had negligently dropped it and if there was a changed relationship it was not obvious upon the surface . David had awaited this evening with both anticipation and trepidation . Why he had been so desirous to see Alain once again in the familiar milieu he could not say but he possessed a foggy idea that it was to restore his own slightly shaken confidence in the continued rightness of things . If Alain fitted in as naturally as he had always clone , then the perturbing reflections that had continued to flit through David 's mind since that brief conversation with his friend in the September night were without substance . And Alain seemed to fit . During the dinner they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically coloured . The late mutiny of the King 's troops at Nancy ( still a burning topic ) was considered , and the Marquis de Meyracq had been most emphatic about it . " The Feast of Federation merely planted mutinous ideas in the soldiers ' minds , " he had asserted . " They complain that their officers are aristocrats . The swine ! The aristocrats are officers because they have been trained to this profession all their lives . Do the sheep-headed rascals imagine that a hulking butcher-boy or a dough-plastered baker out of work is qualified to command troops ? Why , I remember at Metz . . . " And Alain had said nothing beyond offering the information that the private soldiers asserted that the officers peculated their pay . The continual emigration of members of the Nobility wasp234introduced and there was speculation about the activity of the Princes and the agitations at Turin and Coblentz . To these matters Alain was quite silent . Neither did ridicule of the new paper assignats ( the Assembly had authorized eight hundred million of them on the last clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Necker to Switzerland nor the increasing shakiness of M. de Lafayette ( whom the Marquis de Meyracq likened to an uncertain equestrianat a country fair endeavouring to ride two horses at once ) arouse any sparks from the young man . He listened and preserved his good humour and the doughty champion of the ideas of GeorgesJacquesDanton ( who David had feared might manifest himself ) did not appear at all . This was as it should be . And Anne-Marie ? David 's eyes slid round to her . She was sitting at the clavecin but she was not playing . She was leaning forward , her glance intent on Alain 's face and a curiously-baffling expression that made her appear upon the verge of both asking a question and answering one upon her features . David turned to her . " Are you not going to play something ? " he asked in a low voice . She did not hear him but continued to gaze at Alain . A brief sensation of embarrassment touched small spots of colour to David 's face as he sank back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Meyracq 's little legs twinkled as he scurried toward the comfortable fauteuil by the fireplace which Louis-David vacated . Alain , left alone in the middle of the room , glanced about and advanced toward David . As he did so he met Anne-Marie 's inquiring and answering gaze and continued to return it until he reached David 's chair . The American was acutely conscious of these meeting glances that seemed to him to pass above his head like ' two subtle arrows . Even when Alain stopped by David 's chair and put his hand on his friend 's shoulder he did not cease to gaze at Anne-Marie . David , glancing up , saw the young Frenchman 's eyes dilate like those of a cat in darkness . Anne-Marie suddenly touched one note on the clavecin , a tinkle that was like a muffled bell . " I do n't feel like playing , " she said , as though she was answering the question David had already asked , and stood up and walked slowly over to her father . Alain 's fingers unmistakably pressed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , " he said in his low composed voice . " Shall we walk back to the Rue Vivienne ? It is not too far . "  | " If you like , " answered David , rising to his feet . He was conscious for the first time of an indefinable atmosphere of strangeness that appeared to settle slowly over the pleasant salon like an impalpable mist . Yet everything was the same and that puzzled him . The Marquis de Meyracq was coughing testily into the light fire and Louis-David , his arm about his daughter 's shoulder , was advancing toward them with the familiar gentle smile of friendshipupon his face . Anne-Marie , too , was smiling . There was a clear moon and they walked slowly through its pellucid light in the direction of the Palais-Royal . They readied the great bulk of the Hotel de Ville before Alain spoke . " David ! " he exclaimed in a surprised and angry tone . " I love Anne-Marie . " " I have always known it , " replied the American . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared with bewildered astonishment at David . They walked the rest of the way to the Rue Vivienne in silence . A buxom young woman , fiercely wielding a rush broom , thrust the mass of vegetable leaves and scraps of paper from the door of the epicerie called " Au Coin du Roi " into the Place de Greve . She sang loudly : Ah ! Ca ira ! Ca ira ! En depit d'z-aristocrates et d'la pluieNous sous inouillerons , mais ea finira . A furtive little man hurrying down the Rue de la Vannerie heard her and instinctively glanced up at the long iron branch of the street lantern that thrust out from the wall above her . A twisted bit of leather belt still clung to it . The furtive little man eyed the rusted black metal with fearful loathing and hastened his pattering steps.  | THE WINTER seemed to pass in a flash . There are periods like that , when Time is a race-horse , rein-loose , rushing madly toward some invisible goal , urged onward by an imperious Will whose progress is Time itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to his own satisfaction what had actually happened during the winter of 1790-91 and that was because he had played no part in memorable phenomena either of action or of thought . Yet he had enough to think about . It was a mild winter with little rain and many days so warm that the crowds on the boulevards and in the public gardens gave a festive springlike appearance to the city . If it was not so gay as the previous winter when curious travellers come to see a great metropolisprostrate beneath the heavy murderous feet of Revolution found in the Palais-Royal , that barometrical heart of Paris , laughing figures strolling from amusement to amusement , art pushed to the highest degree of perfection in all the objects displayed in the shops on the boulevards , crowded restaurants and theatres and life as a whole easy and abundant , yet it was gay enough to drowse ominous anticipations . More than one incipient Dr. Pangloss sang with Beffroy de Reigny 's Nicodeme : Tous ceux qui n'seront pas contents En France d'leur fortune , A fin d'mieux passer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , things were happening . The National Assembly decreedthe Civic Oath for ecclesiastics , and the King , as Louis-David Couetus had prophesied several times to David , reluctantly sanctionedit . A number of practical bishops and some bull-dozed cures accepted it but the majority of the Clergy resisted and were removed from their churches . A group of these dissidents took over the Eglise des Theatins and conducted services there while the Assembly looked on and the National Guard held at bay the clamorous trouble/makers from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine . In February a mob from this same quarter led by the brewer Santerre attacked the donjon of Vincennes ( apparently considering it time for another Fall of the Bastille ) but was dispersed by Lafayette and his National Guard . In February , too , there was a minor episode ( later , greatly magnified ) at the Tuileries where several noblemen armed with poignards were arrested by the assiduous Lafayette and his militia . Rumour insisted that these men had desired to kidnap the King and carry him over to the Electorate of Treves . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bellows of the agitators , failed to boil over . And the National Assembly was still labouring at the Constitution ! These matters were subjects of gossip for David but his mind was not particularly absorbed by them . He was far more concerned with the psychological problem of Alain 's contradictory attitude toward the uneasy current of the times and his friends . Indeed , David became a sort of half-conscious spy as the weeks sped by and he failed to arrange tidily in his own mind a comprehension of the mental and emotional divagations of the young Frenchman with whom he lived . He was puzzled by the fact that a year ago he had spontaneously opened his heart and mind and affection to Alain , giving himself freely without an effort ( and he knew that he was not of the type that gave itself freely ) , and was now discovering somewhat bewilderedly that the simplicity of intercourse that Ile had taken for granted was increasingly snarled by his failure properly to understand Alain . Therefore , he began to observe the young man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not read what was passing in his friend 's mind and this had not been the case up to a few months ago . He had known Alain better the first time he had met him than he knew him now . And that was odd . During the brief period in Versailles and the longer time in Tressillac , even throughout the first months of their communal life in Paris , they had been closer than brothers , reacting with an inspired spontaneity to each other 's moods , communicating without the need of speech , instantaneously comprehending the natural urges that moved them . A sort of feminine intuition had linked them into a matched unity . But this was changed now . David could no longer prophesy with the old surety the reactions and impulses of Alain . The young Frenchman had changed and yet he had not changed . That was the perplexing part of it . He was still Alain and not an altogether different person as David had briefly feared . The essen- tial foundation of their friendship was not weakened at all . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddening part of it was that David could not exactly put his finger on the shift in this relationship . It was not enough to assume that the reason for the strangeness lay in the fact that they did not meet as often as formerly and that Alain kept his peregrinationspretty much to himself . There were times in the past when they had not met for long periods of time and yet it had raised no barrier of strangeness between them . And as for Alain being secretive , David could not but recall that there had always been many things that the young Frenchman refused to divulge , the mysterious and sudden lapse of communication with his brother , for instance , and the intimate aspects of his attitude toward Anne-Marie . These matters had never been discussed between them and yet David had been aware of no veil that a friend 's right should have lifted . He had understood , or thought he had understood , and carefully abstainedfrom all ' temptations to tear aside that veil . Indeed , he had  --  suspected that Alain assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other word for it ) of these matters and considered this awareness as all that was necessary between friends too close for wordy exphuiations . But now . . . There were half a dozen barely perceptible instances that suggested to David a weakening of that perfect understanding that had maintainedfor so many weeks between him and Alain . Ile could formulatethem as questions but he could not answer them . Why , for instance , had Alain blurted out the fact that lie loved Anne-Marie on that walk from the Rue des Perks to the Rue Vivienne when he must have known that he , David , had been quite aware of that passion since the far-away day in the Chateau de Tressillac when Anne-Marie 's kiss had been a visible signature of it ? What was the reason for Alain 's abstract anger that night ? Or his surprise at his friend 's casual awareness of that love ? Or his complete silence about it since ? David pondered these things even while his reason told him that they amounted to nothing . Something deeper than his reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance of an exquisite relationship , no less , that was in peril and it troubled him both because he could not reason it away and because he could find no explanation for it . Alain 's hero worship of Danton ( whose name was now familiar to all Paris ) troubled him less although that , too , played a part in the slyly loosening bonds of their intercourse . It was not like Alain to fence his enthusiasms with hasty half-explanations , profoundp239silences and semi-embarrassed reticences . He was the essence of frankness . It seemed now to David that long ago as lasting gages of friendship they had exchanged minds , no less , but the recent weeks appeared to show that Alain , in some mysterious way and by imperceptiblesnatches , had subtly taken his mind hack again . But no ! The mind that Alain had given him on the yellow road to Viroflay and again on the high bank of the Loire still belonged to him . It was his to ransack as he pleased . David was frightened to think that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind similar but different from the old and one which he was incapable of sharing with anyone . A bright new hard mind with the glitter of a bayonet . Oh , ridiculous ! It was his own mind , thought David , that had turned into a restless ecureuil foolishly running round and round in a cage of limited intelligence . Alain now possessed what he did not possess before , a mature mind , the mind of a man and not the mind of an affectionate boy . These were the times when people grew up overnight . " I suppose we may all grow up . It is one of the laws of nature , is n't it ? " Ah , yes . Alain had said that . The laws of Nature . Perhaps , David pondered , I am still seeking the boy 's mind in Alain , am still striving to orientate myself in that youthful glow that was peculiarly my own , whereas Alain has inexplicably outgrownthat idealistic lustre while I have been unconscious of it . If this was an explanation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet Alain was Alain . There was no doubt of that . He could find no answers . He was back at the beginning . He could not put his finger on the heart of the matter . And Anne-Marie loved Alain . That was something that he had known all along and yet it was curious how often the thought recurred to him as a tiny little disturbing flash of strange news . Each time the realization impinged upon his mind it startled him and it took a moment ( oh , the veriest spark of a moment ) to adjust himself to it and understand that he had known it for timeless , ageless months . Of course , of course . It was quite as it should be . If ever two human beings were made for each other . . . It was the happiness of his own Alain . . . His thoughts would splinter off , some unconscious force of will driving them into other channels , and he would hasten to the nearest distraction . Gouverneur Morris had returned from England and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne-Marie and the Marquis de Meyracq had gone to Le Pecq for the winter ) and the big-nosed American . Mr. Morris was kindness itself . He took the young man to the premiere of Brutus where they sat in M. d'Angivillier 's box , and listened to the democratic howling from the galleries . He even opened the doors of several salons to him and David proved himself a silent but attentive listener in the houses of Mme. de Flahaut ( who much to Mr. Morris 's inward rage was flirting shamelessly with Lord Wycombe ) , Mme. de Foucault , Mme. de Chastellux and Mme. de Segur . Luckily for Mr. Morris 's peace of mind , Mr. Thomas Paine was still in London busily labouringon a new book with which he intended to revolutionize the world . Mr. Morris sometimes spoke of him with the deepest scorn . It was , then , to such social delights and mental perturbations that the winter sped into oblivion like a race-horse and when the sun of April lengthened the squat towers of Notre-Dame David felt neither younger nor older nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in the National Assembly and idol of the populace , died on April second . On the fourth , toward seven o'clock in the evening , Alain stood in the midst of a mob of spectators on the Rue Montmartre and scornfully watched pass the tremendous cortege bearing the dead body in its coffin ( it was high on the shoulders of sixteen soldiers of the National Guard ) from the Rue de la Chaussee-d'Antin to the Eglise Saint-Eustache where the office for the dead was to be celebratedand thence to the unfinished church of Sainte-Genevieve on the left bank of the Seine . The solemn thunder of footsteps sounded like an interminable cloudburst . For Alain the awesomeness of the spectacle was mitigated by the opinions of Mirabeau that had been instilled in him by the orators and disputators of the Cordeliers quarter . To these wary watchers the Torch of Provence had been suspect . The mighty flame had burnt crookedly and the smoke had reeked . More than one voice , mouthing the name of the dead man , had cried out in the close air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the CounterRevolution . He is endeavouring to negotiate a compromise . " Well , he was dead . His body was in the closed coffin and his heart in the urn that was borne behind it . And even in this death he was betrayed , for the flowers on the urn had fallen aside in such a way as to reveal the corn tale crown engraved upon it . The incessant scrape and thud of innumerable feet ( the only sound in the crowded thoroughfare ) lulled Alain 's mind into a counterfeit aspect of calm . Yet , at the whirling centre of his being he knewp241that he was not calm at all . The calmness , if this monotonous insistence on the inevitable nothingness of all existence could be so called , was outside of him , in the fatalistic surf-beat of the thousands of feet , in the bowed silent faces , in the implied helplessness and fearful respect with which this great mass of humanity acknowledged death . And even these mourners were not actually calm . They were stunned , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted in the restless agonies of blind living . The only calm figure among them all was the man in the coffin whose boldly-hacked smallpox-pitted face still smiled at the thought of being confessed by Msgr. the Bishop of Autun . " I am going to die today . Nothing remains but to envelop one 's self with perfumes , crown one 's self with flowers and surround one 's self with music . " He had said that to Cabanis while the stairs leading to his chamber had been crowded with perturbed mourners . Alain heard the roaring shuffle of the convoy while the whirling centre of his being flung off continual sparks that flashed through the murky smoke of his mind . IIe was glad that he was alone . He was glad that David was not with him , that he did not have to meet that glance so pregnant with unasked questions . Yet . . . he loved David . . . yet . . . it was curious . . . David was somewhere in the streets with Mr. Paine . Mr. Paine had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did he call it ? . . . The Rights of Man . . . David was very much in the company of Mr. Paine . . . and Mr. Paine . . . Anne-Marie . . . When all would dare should one abstain ? Danton had leaned across the table , shaking his great head . " Would he bottle me in this obscure Faubourg ? . . . Would he cage me in this section and bid me climb no higher ? " The footsteps . . . Mirabeau was dead . . . now who would ride this tempest ? Anne-Marie . . . A choked flare released itself and ran along Alain 's mind like some impossible firework. lie had passed through a bewildering experience and he was endeavouring drunkenly to adjust himself to it . There were miraculousthings that happened in the heart and one of them had happened to him . He could not envisage it , yet he could feel it with an almost painful intensity . He could not even explain it . He had gone to the Rue des Perles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ancient familiarity that had never been disestablished but had merely lapsed for a brief period . And what had happened ? Nothing was changed and yet everything was different . The words , the intonations , the speech , the courtesy , the implied tendernesshad been just what he had expected but he seemed to hear and feel everything from a new angle of being . He had felt himself outside the frame of a picture , as it were , and he had gazed and listened from a distance at a scene in which he had once played an accustomed part . If a painted figure on a canvas could step down from its place and stare back with some mysterious amazement at its former dwelling it would feel as he had felt that night . That was why he had been so silent . He could only smile and avoid too close a spiritual approach to ' those painted figures that still existed in their frame . Even the thoughts they expressed , thoughts that had been repeated to him so often that he had formerly thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coating of varnish that robbed ' them of that quickness that had once been in them . He could not argue with them , for they were on the other side of the frame . But it was not this that most perturbed him and roused that whirlingcentre of his being to furious revolutions . It was Anne-Marie who had done that . She had stepped outside the frame and stared at him and in that moment 's miraculous happening an explosion had occurred within him . Even now as the endless cortege grumbled by he could see her face with its long grey-green eyes darting cometwiseout of the frame at him and exploding the latent passion within him , the fiery emotion that he had never known existed . That was the miracle , and as he could not explain it to himself neither could he explain it to David . No futile ponderings on the past could aid him , either . He could visualize himself clearly as a boy in the village of Tressillac , climbing the steep hill to the chateau every day , playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draughty stone corridorsand quite unaware of that fact of which his elder brother was so aware  --  that the family of M. Couetus lived on another plane than his own . Even the grey rains and biting winds of winter had failed to chill the friendly ardour of those far-away days . Anne-Marie had been flesh and blood like himself . When she had fallen her nose had bled and he could remember awkwardly binding up her knee once when she had slid down the hill and fallen amongst the stones . His youth had been as simple . Perhaps he had been aware of distinctions then but they had never troubled him . With Anne-Marie he had ridden the narrow roads and forest paths and with Anne/Marie he had sat at table and viewed her almost as a sister , anyway as the child his own mother had washed and tended and kissed . It never occurred to him that Louis-David Couctus , like so many of the small seigneurs of the Vendee , had casually broken down bars that existed in other parts of France . No , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of this miracle that had happened in the Rue des Perles . He saw his former relationship with Anne-Marie in a retrospect that possessed no foggy edges . It was clear , sharp-cut and welldefined . Even that supreme shift in their respective attitudes that had changed him into the worshipper and her into the worshipped had been reasonable and comprehensible . Because she was goodnessitself , because she was tender and intuitive and generous in her affection , because she understood him as no one had ever understood him , he had instinctively placed her in that temple of adoration , of his soul 's spontaneous worship , where Yves had once been throned . That was simple . In his loneliness she had comforted him and because of his loneliness , because she had always been the sister in his life , he had raised an altar to her . It had pleased him and given him a satisfaction that was boundless . Together with David she had fulfilled that aching need within him for a close spiritual intercourse . The wound and the void that Yves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly missed Yves ( Yves who was very probably in this very procession that passed and never seemed to pass and whom he had not seen since that day in his mother 's house on the bank of the Loire ) and when he thought of him , which he did seldom , he appeared like some foggy apparition from another world . But Anne-Marie had always been real , the visible goddess in the temple , and her reality had been an inestimable factor in the serenity of his days . But now everything was changed . Since she had stepped out of the frame , existing in an awful detached reality that had not been perceptible to him when all the others had been real , she was no longer a source of serenity to hint . That was the incomprehensible rt of it , the miracle , the unexpected happening that had smashed is peace of mind . He endeavoured to account for this change in itself by attributing it to the lapse of time during which he had t seen her ( weeks and weeks , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that he had grown almost overnight  --  at least , the course of a few months  --  from naive youth to an inexperienced d troublesome manhood , but how could this natural development shift his relationship toward Anne-Marie ? He felt himself to the same person and foggily he was sure that it was not he who had stepped out of the frame but rather the frame and all that it containedwhich had been frighteningly enough removed from him . But Anne-Marie was not in the frame . She had stepped out of it and joined him . They were on the same plane , a plane of vibrant flesh and blood . Therefore , they should be the same . Their relationshipshould . . . He could n't work it out at all . He regretted that he had blurted out that statement to David on the silent walk home that night from the Rue des Perles . But it had seemed to rise out of him like a gust of discovery , of angry discovery at some inexplicable change in himself . And David had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of God did he mean by that ? How could he have always known what had never existed until that night ? Unless . . . he meant the old worship which had been no secret at all . But David 's tone had not implied that . It had assumed more . . . the very substance , in fact , of that newborn passion that had exploded with crazed suddenness in the salon in the Rue des Perles where all of them , Louis-David , the Marquis de Meyracq , the silently-attentive Jean-Antoine , even David himself , had stood about like painted figures on a lifeless background . Only Anne-Marie and himself had been living testimonials of that moment . When all would dare should one abstain ? Again ! It seemed to him that that cryptic phrase of Danton 's spoken across the table in the Cafe Procope at a heated moment and the connection and sense of which were quite forgotten had crossed his mind a dozen times this ( lay , darting through his thoughts with some mysterious meaning of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heavilypassingfeet beat it out on the cobblestones like a senseless refrain to the indignant thoughts that clamoured in his mind . He did not want to feel this way toward Anne-Marie . He did not want . . He did . . . When all would dare . . . Desperately he clutched his hands and watched the eternal procession . All the world seemed to be passing in silent cavalcade toward the unfinished church of Sainte-Genevieve , now no longer to be a church but a pantheon to the great dead of France . Aux Brands hommes la Patric . Reconnaissante . Members of the National Assembly , representatives of the court , National Guards , shopkeepers , blocs from the clubs , beggars , all the diverse elements that Mirabeau had momentarily united or kept in grumbling federation passed , filling the Rue Montmartre from side to side , their feet beatingp245a last elegy to the scornful immoral immortal skeptic whose heart lay in the urn blazoned with the comtale crown . Who now was spurred to ride the whirlwind ? And Alain 's thoughts turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , where a great gargoyle head bowed over a stained table . As soon as Anne-Marie returned from Le Pecq ( which was not until June ) Alain lost no time in seeking her out at the house in the Rue des Perles . He seemed to be driven there by a will that was his own and yet not his own , a sort of hurricane of urgency that thrust him before it like a leaf in a high wind . During the two months and more that elapsed between Mirabeau 's funeral and Anne-Marie 's return he had existed in a rising tempest of restlessnesswhich he concealed from David by staying away from the Rue Vivienne as much as possible . It was not that his affection for the American had lessened in any way but he felt himself incapable of lucidly explaining what was happening to him . It was easy enough to avoid David , for that young man was peculiarly engrossed in the constant company of either Mr. Gouverneur Morris and his fine French ladies or Mr. Paine and his fine libertarian ideas . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on keeping away from the Rue Vivienne himself . As a matter of fact , each of the young men was beginning to experience an inexplicable embarrassment in the other 's company that was as disconcerting as it was strange . Alain attributed this vaguely to the surprising state of his feelingstoward Anne-Marie and it was with as much of an intent to study himself as to see Anne-Marie that he went so hurriedly to the Rue des Perles . Yet both impulses were so inextricably interwoventhat he could not say which was the stronger . He only knew that a resistless blast was blowing him toward the Rue des Perles and that its mingled elements included himself , his future and Anne-Marie . He must see . . . he must see . . . Were they both still outside the frame staring nakedly at each other or was he the victim of an enormous delusion ? Was it the times that were changing him into the complicated tangle of nerves and raw passionsthat he was ? And the times were quite sufficient so to disorientateany young man . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death a change had come over Paris and so over France . It was as though a stabilizing unit had been removed from the scene and the various elements , held together before , were putting apart , flying into disparate bits and breaking up into inde-P246pendent worlds . Hardly had the tears for the extinguished Torch of Provence dried than the republican agitators , always a seething element but heretofore kept in some check , flared up in blazing defiance . The clubs , especially the Jacobin , vociferated louder than ever and the voice of Maximilien Robespierre began to penetrate the chaos like a taut echoing wire . A renewed recalcitrance manifested itself in the National Assembly where Maury could mount the tribuneand cry , " Mirabeau is no longer here . Therefore , no one can prevent me from speaking . " The royal family was more jealously guarded than ever . The populace , urged on by who knows what agents , feared a flight of the King , and on April eighteenth when he desired to go to SaintClouda mob forced him back into the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed guards paraded the corridors of the Tuileriesand at every door shone the glitter of bayonets . It was a springtime of mutual distrust on all sides and inexplicable fears . A nervosity that was akin to fever agitated the city . The food of the clay was suspicion . There were rumours of impending invasions from beyond the frontiers . The Emperor Leopold was feared . The King of Prussia was feared . The King of Naples was feared . The King of Spain was feared . Mr. Pitt was feared . The emigres at Coblentz were feared . Bouille , commanding the King 's troops in the north , the man who had suppressed the mutiny at Nancy , was distrusted . A coup de main of the enrages hung constantly in the sunny air above Paris like a great black fist . And the National Assembly was still labouring at the Constitu-tion ! In such an abnormal atmosphere it was small wonder that young men were hot-headed and impulsive . Alain was amazed that the hand he lifted to swing the bronze knocker on the door did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the black chill-looking fireplace in the salon with a somewhat surprised expression on her face . She had just picked up a sealed envelope from the mantel . She turned quickly with a slight start when Alain entered the room but relaxed when she saw who it was . " It is you , " she said . " You are prompt to greet me . I have but returned these five minutes . Is David well ? " P247Her grey-green eyes flickered composedly across his face and then dropped to the missive she held in her hand . Alain leaned forward and regarded her with a hungry intensity . It was true , then . Every bit of it was true . Yet he had known that it would be true . He had known it all the time . She was not in the frame . She was out of it . She was an integral part of his world . She was all of his world . The reflections spun in his head like the fireworks he had seen at Versailles and for a moment his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drinking her in through his sight . There was a tiny mole just below her left ear and the corners of her mouth were slightly sucked in , delicate indentations as though a soft breath had drawn them so . Her eyelasheswere darker than her hair and beneath the lower lids a faint bluish tinge like that of skimmed milk stained ( or , rather , hinted at staining ) the whiteness of the skin . He took several steps toward her . " What did you say ? " he asked in a low voice . She lifted her eyes and opened them widely in brief surprise . He could see the tiny blood sacs in the corners of her eyes . The pupils were like curious jewels . " I asked you if David were well , " she replied . " Have you lost your hearing , Alain ? " " David is quite well , " he responded in the same low voice . " I understand that he is dining with the American , M. Morris , this evening . " Her glance sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his breath with a half-sob . He could smell her body , he was sure of it , a faint clear troubling odour like spring water and shaded moss . Beneath her clothes was her body and the realizationcame to him like a shock . His eyes dropped to the whiteness of her throat where it vanished into the gown she wore and then to her breast where the swelling mousseline softly rose and fell . The back of his throat was dry and he felt the blood pounding from his heart . " What did you say ? " he asked wildly . He was unsteady with mingled emotions of shame and satisfaction . She laughed outright when he repeated the question , a short infectiousnote that in other times would have brought an answering smile to his face but which now increased the scowl of pain that was deepening on his forehead . " You are both deaf and absurd , " she said with friendly impatience . She was not as tall as he was . Her shoulders were slight butp248sturdy . She stood very straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have already answered my question , M. Forgetfulness , " she continued . Why did she look out the window , at the letter she held in her hand , at anything but him ? Had it always been so ? He could not remember . It seemed to him now that he was seeing her for the first time . And now she was speaking again . Her voice was like the water gurgling over the white stones in the little stream that ran through the meadows by Carquefou . The Marquis de Meyracq was in his chamber above , resting from the coach trip from Le Pecq . The marquis hated coaches so . Her father had apparently gone out somewhere . At least , he did not appear to be about the house anywhere . The little house at Le Pecq had been charming and ever so warm . Nine fireplaces that had blazed night and day . Did he know that Francoise had left the household and taken over the laundry of her sister across the Seine ? Did he . . . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were words and they meant nothing at all to him . He was passing through a cruel and exquisite agony that seemed to increase with every second . And yet he must be saying something , for she appeared to pause for his rejoinders and receive them without surprise or perturbation . Could it be possible that the agony possessing him was invisible to her ? " I can not ask you to stay tonight for dinner , " she was saying and she extended her hand . The minute his fingers touched hers a rushing heat seemed to run along his arm and he hastily withdrew his hand . She was all fire and flesh and delicious odours , a body to be passionately clasped and possessed . He would have to hasten away before he prostrated himself before her . He was certain that he was staggering as he made for the door and he was not aware until he was halfway down the Rue des Perles , striding toward the river , that he had passed Jean-Antoine in the corridor and failed to respond to his greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it impossible to compose his thoughts and establish rationally to himself the reasons for this emotional crisis , this choking up of his mind , as it were , that had come so suddenly upon him like a bolt out of the blue . Was he losing his reason that an anticipated meeting could so disintegrate his poise and self-balance in this way ? What had happened to him ? He felt like clasping his head in both hands and crying out the question to the men and women who faded by him like wraiths blown on the wind . He was suddenly possessed , thatp249was it , he was suddenly possessed . The mounting fever of his mind , a fever that was soaring with the unrest of the times , that was fed by the troubled air that filled the lungs of all Paris , had achieved its dizzy climax . That was it . That was it . He fled clown the Rue des Perles as though an implacable dxmon was at his heels . Anne-Marie stood by the black chill-looking fireplace in the salon with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and she was regarding the door with a reflective air . A thin frown half-gathered and was invisibly smoothed away on her forehead . Still observing the door , she tore open the letter . For a moment she stood without glancing at it as though she was resolving something in her mind ; then , with abruptly-lifted eyebrows and a slight shrug of the shoulders , she fixed her attention on the letter . It was in her father 's handwriting . With slowly-parting lips and a stiffeningof her slender figure she readMy Dearest , It is my misfortune that I will not be here to receive you when you come . But you will remember a conversation we had in Le Pecq last week and I think you will be half-prepared to understand what I can not directly tell you . The time that we have spoken of increasingly of late has come . That is all that I can say but by tomorrow night at the latest you will know what I mean . Reserve all your prayers for that Other . God grant complete success to all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louis-David CouetusShe crushed the letter in her hand and held it against her mouth . lie twilight which poured steadily into the salon immersed her in a hantom-fluid that rose about her like the ghost of water . Sudenly , snatching up her gown in front , she fled across the tessellated our and into the hall . " Uncle ! Uncle ! My uncle ! " she called in a frightened voice as ht  --  sped up the stairs to the first floor. jean-Antoine , hastily returning from the door , saw the flicker f her red shoes as she disappeared into the darkness above.  | IT WAS sometime after eight o'clock when Louis-David Couetusapproached the Palais de Tuileries by way of the Rue Saint-Nicaise . The sky , from which the last hint of clay had faded , was sombre and starless but the illuminated windows and flaring torches of the military posts flooded the narrow thoroughfarewith broad splashes of light . As he turned into the Place du Carrousel , Louis-David became unpleasantly aware of the multitude of circulating guards and posted sentinels , all sectionaries , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace , whose glowing windows loomed before him , was like a fortressjail . At every possible egress stood National Guards , suspicious and inquisitive , who had their King caged and meant to keep him so . These watchdogs , armed to the teeth and formidable in their surly purpose , patrolled all the issues from the gardens and courts , the unlighted sweep of the river terrace , the broad stairways and even the humble serving doors . Their unavoidable eyes glittered from the shadows and high-pitched stone entrances . But the Place du Carrousel , as well , contained a large number of curious-minded burghers , mere idle wanderers , who strolled aimlesslyabout , endeavoured to chaff with the taciturn sectionaries and exchanged badinage with the more receptive coachmen whose long line of fiacres stood the entire length of the palace . They were apparently drawn to the Tuileries as boys are drawn to a shuttered circus-wagon in which they know lurks a concealed tiger . It was with these objectless loiterers that Louis-David mingled as he crossed the Place toward the entrance to the Cour des Princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courier 's outfit he had purchased in the Rue Saint-Honore near the Oratory of the handme-downmerchant Longprix wrought a marvellous change in his customary fastidious appearance . All the same , he was nervous , nervous as a sensitive man is when he has embarked on a hazardous exploit that requires every atom of his intelligence and resourcefulness . He could guess what the ambiguous note from the Comte Axel de Fersen had meant although he could not know precisely what part he was to play in the imminent drama . The words of that note were clear in his mind : " Purchase a courier 's outfit that will disguise you well at Longprix 's on the Rue Saint-Honorc near the Oratory and attend me in the Place du Carrousel after eight o'clock on the twentieth . The time has come . " That was all ; but the handwriting he knew , the memory of his promise to Fersen in Versailles was vibrant in his mind and the intent of the Swedish nobleman he could surmise . After all , there was but one desperate gesture to attempt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was his intent to reach the Cour des Princes , circle it , then return to the Place du Carrousel and make his way leisurely toward the Cour des Suisses , wander about that barren square , strike up the Rue du Carrousel to the Petite-Place du Carrousel and retrace his steps again to the Rue Saint-Nicaise . In this way he hoped to be accosted by Fersen , who , he supposed , would be concealed under some disguise similar to his own . But before he passed beneath the archway to the Cour des Princes the coachman on the end carriagein the file before the palace hissed at him . He turned quickly and stared into the intent face of the Comte de Fersen . The young foreigner was enveloped in the greatcoat and distinctive hat of a street Jehu . " Yes , " said Louis-David quickly . Fersen 's face was very grave and he appeared to be labouring under some excitement . " I knew I could count on you , monsieur , " he said swiftly . " We are extricating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cour des Princes and join the two men there by the door nearest the Pavilion de Fiore . I f anyone accosts you explain that you are a courier of the Comte de Provence . He is supping with the King tonight . There is . . . " A corporal 's guard , one of the men bearing a flambeau , tramped noisily toward them between the palace and the file of carriages and Fersen whirled abruptly and began a conversation in raucous argot with the coachman behind him . Louis-David turned with careful nonchalance . He had guessed correctly . The mysterious powers who arrange all things had selected him to aid in snatching the royal family from the vast stone rat-trap wherein it was now sequestered . With the tumult of hundreds of guards behind him and the prickling sensation of scores of invisible eyes peering forth from secret corners on all sides , he shivered slightly but not with fear . It was one of those impossible enterprises that called for young men but Louis-David , in spite of the cold wave of excitement that momentarily swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous attempt . Surely the outraged gods who watched from their alienated heaven wouldp255favour this desperate endeavour . Whatever the result , he would do his part . For an instant he thought of Anne-Marie and smiled . The cryptic note he had left for her might not explain anything but when she knew , as she would know on the morrow , she would approve and thank her old-fashioned God for the choice that had settled on her father . He walked casually across the Cour des Princes , ignoring the motionless guard by the archway who turned to stare after him , and , pausing by the door nearest the Pavilion de Fiore , recognized instantlythe two men , clad like himself in couriers ' outfits , who stood idly there in low converse . To the passer-by they might seem no more than waiting domestics of accredited visitors to the palace , a sight to be seen every evening in the Cour , but to Louis-David they were Francois-Florent de Valory and Francois-Melchior de Moustier de Bermont , both officers in the Compagnie de Beauvau of the Gardes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versaillesand Paris . They knew him and greeted him calmly . But , greetings once exchanged , there was little to be said . Louis-David realized that not one of them was aware what part he was to play or how free he was to discuss matters with the others . They were willing pawns in a great game played by principals whose names were not even whispered . They stood there , then , watching the dark moonless sky above the great pit of the Cour , the occasional flares as details of National Guards passed the gate , and hearing the turmoilof voices and clanking weapons from the Place du Carrousel . They had not to wait long for suddenly out of the nearby door stepped an unknown gentleman in a black cloak and Spanish hat who approached them , silently indicated the open portal to LouisDavidand beckoned de Valory and de Moustier to follow him . All this seemed to happen in an instant when the Cour was momentarily deserted , and Louis-David , who knew this portion of the palace well , miraculously discovered himself behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by two smoking lanterns . It was deserted . He hurried past the closed doors of the royal dining-chamber , the billiard-room and the private quarters of the Queen and mounted the little twisting staircase that led to the floor above . On the first landing a short portly figure awaited him with outstretched hand . It was Louis XVI . " Welcome , my friend , " said the King in a low voice as he drew Louis-David rapidly into the nearest chamber , which proved to be the Queen 's library . The pseudocourier was impressed by the imperturbability of the monarch , for the fat lymphatic hand that held his was tremorless and cold . The plump-cheeked countenance with its vague inquiring eyes , now illuminated by the clear glow of a dozen candles , was as calm and emptied of emotion as the faces of the sheep LouisDavidhad seen on his domains at Tressillac . " M. Couetus , " murmured the King . " Fersen has chosen well . There is hardly time to . . . " He stopped as an opposite door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unknown man in the black cloak . " Ah ! " exclaimed Louis and rubbed his hands together . It was obvious that he had not the slightest idea of what to say . He glanced from face to face , smiled briefly and turned in relief when the unknown man spoke . " One of the guards saw us , " he explained in a grating voice . " In fact , he opened the door for us . But that means nothing . He was a mere boy . " " A mere boy , " repeated the King . He was about to say more when the door opened again and a simply-dressed woman glided into the room . It was the Queen . Immediately she took charge of the proceedings and Louis XVI appeared to fade with some relief into the background . LouisDavidsaw that Marie-Antoinette had aged perceptibly during the past few months . Fine wrinkles had made their appearance about her eyes and her Austrian underlip , always the most ugly of her features , protruded more than ever . But the charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted the three men , calling them by their names and then smilinglypointing out that they would have to assume others more in keeping with their couriers ' outfits , she impressed again on **25;3992;TOOLONG the conviction of a born queenliness . Louis might not always seem to be the son of St. Louis but Marie-Antoinette , even in her most informal moments , was the **25;4019;TOOLONG of a crown . " Come , I will give you names , " said the Queen , a half-smile brightening her countenance . " You , M. de Moustier , shall be Melchior . Was he not one of the three wise men ? And you , M. de Valory , shall be simply Francois . As for you , M. Couetus , from henceforth I baptize you Saint-Jean . " " Excellent , excellent , " agreed the King , rubbing his hands together . He cleared his throat , and , at a nod from the Queen , began to speak slowly . " I can tell you no more than this , " he said . " We propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bouillep257have prepared the way . It is your duty and . . . er . . . privilege to assist us in the attempt . Everything . . . er . . . " " Everything is in the hands of Fersen , " said Marie-Antoinette softly . " Yes , " added the King in his slow thick voice . " Everything is in the hands of Fersen . " To Louis-David , watching curiously the faces of these two , the monarch suddenly seemed like a great helpless puppet pulled hither and thither by forces of which he had no conception . Even his flight was not of his own conniving . Instead of leading , he followed , hardly aware of the direction in which he was travelling or the reasonsthat pushed him toward this unkingly attempt . His goodhumouredindecisive face was a heartbreaking map of his whole life . There was a different spirit in the Queen 's expression . If she was not familiar with the road she was journeying ( and who could be so wise in times like these ? ) , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no hesitation in her demeanour but rather a stubbornness of purpose that contrasted starkly with the acquiescent puzzlement of the King . It was the Queen who was now directing the unknown man in the black cloak to conduct de Valory and de Moustier to safer quarters . It was the Queen who was urging him toward the large armoire with the fretwork door that stood in a corner of the small library . She , at least , had some conception of the plan of campaign . There was a faint odour of perfumed garments and old leather in the obscurity of the armoire but it was not uncomfortable to stand there and peer through the slits of the fretwork oblong of the door and wait for what might happen . From his snug hiding-place Louis-David could see a portion of the room and the door to the corridor . He settled himself in as restful a position as possible , his back against the rosewood panelling , and began to revolve in his mind the possibilities of the night . Everything was in the hands of Fersen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis-David 's acquaintanceship with Fersen and court gossip had naturally impressed upon him the fact that for years the Swedish nobleman had been the prime favourite of Marie-Antoinette . He it was to whom she turned when she desired a sympathetic and unambitious confidant . It was but natural that rumour and scandaloustongues should associate him most intimately with the Queen , should , in fact , place him in her bed at discreet intervals , but this was gossip of which Louis-David had taken no heed . If Fersen was Marie-Antoinette 's lover he had shown himself extraordinarily capable in blinding the eyes of the scandalmongering court to any compromising gestures on his part . And the King , if he suspected any such intrigue , was a past-master in dissimulation . All this , however , did not matter . What did matter was the ostensiblefact that everything this night was in the hands of Fersen . It was even possible that the lives of all of them depended on his wit and resourcefulness . If they did get safely away . . . And Louis-David endeavoured to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that the carefully-guarded birds had flown . There would be bewilderment and anger and rising terror and a fear of the consequences that might follow when the emigres and foreign kings possessed the rallying-point of the royal family . And then . . . Slight misgivings disturbed Louis-David 's reflections as he realizedwhat the results of this flight might be . War , of course , a civil war certainly , and , perhaps , an invasion by foreign powers . He could not enter into the mind of the King ( indeed , he was dubious whether or not Louis possessed a mind at all on these matters ) but he preferred to believe that he intended to go no farther than Metz . Had he not said something about Bouille ? Was it not reasonable to suppose , then , that Louis intended to go to Bouille , animate his army ( which , presumably , was loyal to the crown ) and return to Paris with it ? What would the psychological effect of this gesture be ? Was there not a good possibility that the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fling itself to its feet before this triumphal entry , that the Assembly would dissolveor submit itself and that Louis , the Pardoner , the Pacificator , the Restorer , would raise the throne of St. Louis higher than ever ? Why , one would not need even the Red Heels of Conde for that , much less the White Jackets of Austria . It could all be accomplishedby good Frenchmen . And then a revised Constitution . . . and Peace . But . . . and the stubborn Austrian underlip of Marie-Antoinetteappeared before Louis-David 's musing eyes . Supposing the King did go to Austria . Supposing he did appeal to foreign arms . It would not be the first time that a French leader had opened the door to alien troopers , to be sure , for had not Coligny called in the English and the Germans , had not the League called in the House of Austria , was not the great Conde willing to lead Spaniards to Paris after the Fronde ? But , somehow , this was different . An invasion of foreign forces would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , that babbled so loudly of American principles , and the moderates , who sought only a fair Constitution ,  |p259would  join together and the land would sprout armies . The possibilitieswere awful to contemplate . Louis-David 's face was very grave as the potentialities of a misstep on the King 's part occurred to him . His reasoning , rapid and slight as it was , had suddenly brought him to the delicate position of deciding whether or not his heart was in this enterprise to which he had sworn himself . " No , no ! " he argued desperately . " The King will not go so far afield as Austria . He will not go to Leopold . He will not listen to the blood-thirsty emigres who are inspired by the Comte d'Artois . He will turn at Metz with Bouille at his right hand and Choiseul at his left and ride back on Paris . And he will be met with triumphal arches . " The will to believe was insuperable and by an effort that was almost physical Louis-David convinced himself of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob at the door to the library and the concealed man hastily pressed his face against the fretworkof the elaborately cut armoire , peering out to see if some messenger had come for him . It was a woman who entered . She was middle-aged and the somewhat harassed face she turned about the deserted room was perceptibly lined beneath the generousapplication of cosmetics . Under her arm she carried a small pug-nosed lapdog that snuffled loudly . Louis-David , instinctively aware that this visitor had not come for him , fairly held his breath as she moved quickly about the chamber , picking up a paper from the table and glancing at it and feeling the nib of a quill pen that lay near it . A soft male voice from the half-open door attracted his attention and he saw the head of a National Guard . " Mme. Rochereuil , " called the soldier . " Is there anything for M. de Gouvion ? " The woman turned her harassed face to the speaker . " No . I mean I do not know , " she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not find anything . I was sure I heard strange footsteps . But . . . " " Well , well , " said the soldier . " Do n't you begin to imagine things . But keep your eyes open and if there is anything rememherthat M. de Gouvion is presenting himself with General de Lafayette at eleven o'clock . " " Very well , " replied Mme. Rochereuil . " Have you seen any-thing ? " " Only the Comte de Provence and his lady passing in to supper , " answered the soldier . Quite suddenly he removed his head from the doorway and Mme. Rochereuil passed near the armoire as she made a slow circuit ofp260the room preparatory to leaving . The lapdog thrust out his ugly snout at the fretwork , sniffed and emitted a short bark . LouisDavidsuddenly ceased to breathe as he leaned back from the curving perforations . An instant later he heard the door to the library close softly . M. de Gouvion . Why , that was Lafayette 's aide-de-camp . But who was Mme. Rochereuil ? A spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that Fersen should . . . The door had opened again and Louis-David hastily applied his eye to the fretwork . This time it was the unknown gentleman in the black cloak and Spanish hat . He walked directly to the armoire and pulled the door open . " You will be good enough to follow me , monsieur , " he exclaimed in his grating voice . " You should know , " said Louis-David firmly as he stepped into the room , " that there is a spy in the Queen 's household . " The unknown gazed calmly at him for a moment . " Yes , " he replied finally . " Mme. Rochereuil , who has charge of Her Majesty 's baths and carries the keys to the smaller apartments . Follow me , monsieur . " Silently Louis-David followed him from the library , down the twisting flight of stone stairs , through a nearby door and into a small square chamber that was obviously the cabinet de toilette of the Queen . Marie-Antoinette was standing near a table upon which was heaped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber-women whom Louis-David later discovered to be Mme. Thibault . The Queen glanced up with a faint smile , nodded to the unknown who immediately left the room as though his actions had been already outlined for him , and then turned back to the pile of garmentson the table . It was very quiet in the small chamber and the measured tread of a sentinel 's feet could be heard in the corridor overhead . Louis-David decided that beneath Marie-Antoinette 's assumed calm was an inner excitement that was kept in check by pure will power . He desired to speak to her of Mme. Rochereuil , for the calm admission of the unknown had not reassured him in any degree , but before he was given this opportunity the door opened again and three women appeared urging two sleepy children before them . A spasm of anxiety flashed across Marie-Antoinette 's face . " Mme. de Tourzel , " she said in a steady voice . " There is no time to be lost . Here is the clothing . " Louis-David , standing rigidly near the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber-womenp261hastily stripped off the night-clothes of the thirteen-year-old girl and the six-year-old boy . He had seen the royal children before but always elaborately-garmented and attended . It was curious and pathetic to see them now , fairly staggering with sleep , the Dauphin fiercely rubbing his eyes with his small fist , calmly surrendering themselves to the unfamiliar costumes that were being hastily drawn over their heads . Madame Royale seemed quite unlike herself in a quaint brown linen dress strewn with yellow and white flowers but the Dauphin was absolutely unrecognizable in a costume de fillette , little petticoats that reached almost to the floor . The small girl , who had conquered her sleepiness , observed her brother and laughed outright . " Oh , mama , " she exclaimed to the Queen . " He is charming ! " Louis-Charles , Duc de Normandie and Dauphin of France , thrust out his underlip and meditated a wail of protest . But he was too sleepy . His eyes began to close and his head sunk against Mme. de Tourzel 's knee . The Queen ruffled his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a persuading voice . " Can you guess what we are going to do ? " The child wearily opened his eyes and fumbled at the objectionable petticoats . " Yes , " he replied in a bored tone . " We are going to play comediessince we are disguised . " At this moment the King quietly entered the cabinet and stood for a moment with his back to the door watching the two children . There was an expression of concern on his face and his heavy cheeks seemed to sag a little . In his right hand he clasped a folded paper . " Madame , " he said to Marie-Antoinette in an apologetic voice , " all of this seems . . . perhaps a postponement . . . " The Queen merely lifted her head and looked at him . For an instant their glances locked and then Louis appeared to shrug his shoulders slightly . He stepped forward and handed the folded paper to Mme. de Tourzel . " This , " he explained , " is an attestation that in case of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that you have been authorized by the King to travel with the Son of France . One must be prepared for . . . er ... " I Hs voice dwindled away and he tugged gloomily at his underlip . The Queen , her lips pressed firmly together , continued to completeflu. dressing of the two children with the aid of Mme. de Tourzel , who had taken the King 's folded paper and thrust it in the bosomof her black dress . Louis 's slightly-bulging eyes flickered from face to face . He did not seem to see Louis-David standing stiffly by the wall . Finally he sighed and turned . " Has your brother of Provence left the palace ? " asked the Queen in a dry tone . Louis shook his large head . " Not yet , " he said . Then he added morosely : " I shall have to remain visible until M. de Lafayette presents himself . " He cleared his throat and rocked slightly back and forth on his heels . " Well , " he remarked after a lugubrious pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly out of the room . Louis-David thought the Queen 's eyelids were faintly pink when she raised them and glanced in his direction . Again he was about to speak but again she gave him no opportunity . A small ormolu clock on the dressing-table softly chimed the half-hour and she started as though this was a signal warning her that time was flying . With a rapid gesture she drew a dark wrap about her shoulders . " Come , madame , " she exclaimed , addressing Mme. de Tourzel . " It will never do to stop and think about this matter . Come . You should have been on your way a half-hour ago . " She seized Madame Royale by the hand and urged her toward the door . Mme. de Tourzel , after a frightened glance about the chamber , picked up the Dauphin , who immediately thrust one arm about her neck and fell fast asleep , and followed the Queen . Marie-Antoinetteopened the door and peered out into the corridor . She stood there for a full minute , her small daughter leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumbering boy . Louis-David , from his position by the wall , could see her resolutely-squared shoulders that appeared to be motionlessly resistingan impulse to weaken . For an instant , so still was the room , he imagined that he could hear the accelerated beat of her heart . Then she passed out into the murk of the corridor , drawing the lagging girl behind her , and Mme. de Tourzel , an expression of extreme fear on her face , mutely followed . The door swung shut , making a faint click like the sound of a tongue . The two women who were left in the room glanced at each other with perturbed eyes . There was agitation , fright and bewilderment in their faces . One of them , the elder , who appeared to be more than fifty years old , turned to Louis-David in evident perplexity . " Monsieur , " she said in a shaking voice , " are you aware of what we are supposed to do ? No one has explained to us . I am Mme.p263Brunier and this is Mme. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " She lifted her shoulders in a gesture of puzzlement . Louis-David shook his head . " I do not know what I am expected to do , myself , " he replied ; then , observing the evident bewilderment of the two women , he added , " I imagine you will be informed in good time regarding your movements . " This was small solace to the two women and they showed it by their dubious glances . Mme. Brunier unwittingly began to rip her small handkerchief to shreds and Mme. de Neuville nervously folded and refolded the abandoned night-clothes of the two children . There appeared to be no further inclination for conversation among the three of them . It was as though they were in a chamber surrounded by attentive ears . When Louis-David cleared his throat the two women started and glanced accusingly at him . This silence , which seemed like an eternity but which endured for no more than five minutes , was broken only when the door swiftly opened and Marie-Antoinette hurried in . Her eyes were decidedly red now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choking voice to the room at large , and then , seeing the two agitated women , exclaimed , " What , are you here still ? You must be on your way to Claye . Hurry , hurry ! " Impulsively she pushed them toward the door . The nervous gesture appeared to reinforce her determination to remain calm . Both the women resisted , speaking at once . " But how shall we reach Claye ? " " And from there where shall we go ? " " Hurry , hurry ! " repeated the Queen , thrusting them out into the corridor . " This gentleman will lead you . " Louis-David caught a glimpse of the unknown man in the black cloak . Marie-Antoinette came back into the room , closed the door behind her and leaned against it . She was breathing rapidly and she closed her eyes for a moment . When she opened them she saw Louis- ! ) avid . " You will attend the King here , monsieur , " she said in her care- ( Idly calm voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , reconsidering what she was about to say , and , apparentlydeciding not to say it at all , inclined her head as he had often seen her incline it at Versailles and walked across the cabinetp264de toilette to the right-hand door that led to the bedchamber and disappeared . Again that unholy silence dominated the chamber , a silence that was only intensified by the tiny ticking of the clock on the dressingtable . There were moments when silence was the worst of all torturesand these were the moments when one fearfully waited for the unexpected to happen . Louis-David could imagine himself placidly seated in this chamber so redolent of the intimate life of the Queen and lost in a pleasant day-dream through which fluttered tiny Boucher cupids . But not now . Not now when the very bottles and jars of unguents and pomades and perfumes on the dressingtableseemed so forlorn and tragic , the forsaken debris of sunnier days . All the vanities and furbelows and pleasant odours , the featheredslippers that peeped from beneath the table , the sleeping-mask of soft white suede that lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the body and volatile pride of the Queen appeared to the Seigneur of Tressillac like the memorials of someone dead , the memorials , perhaps , of that gracious woman who ruled the Little Trianon , and , garmented in white muslin and blue ribbons , churned the golden cream in the toy hameau at Versailles ; but who would never saunter through those charming paths again , because , alas , she no longer existed . That woman had ceased to be on the afternoon of October 5 , 1789 . Louis-David sat down by the dressing-table and idly picked up a small crystal flacon upon the side of which was inset a cameo . He held it in his hand for a long time , staring unseeingly at it and even unaware of what it was . From his sad speculations about the Queen he drifted into even sadder speculations about the King . Indecisive , good-natured , well-meaning , stupid Louis ! He knew him now , knew the debility of his will , the hesitancy of his character , the feebleness of his acumen . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set . All of them ( and by " them " he meant those who were endeavouring to establish a stable constitutionalmonarchy ) would have to watch over this excellent-hearted but dull-witted Son of St. Louis and see to it that false advisers did not lead him astray . Unstable as he was he was the only bulwarkfor order and tradition against the growling waves of anarchy . A curious change was coming over Louis-David and he sensed it . He no longer had any respect for the man who was called Louis Capet but the throne , the mystery of Divine Right , the legendary focal-point of all loyalties that was called Louis XVI , convinced him by its rightness and psychological strength . If he could only fit the disparate bits of this occult puzzle together and find out wherep265Louis Capet and Louis XVI merged he would understand the mystery of the throne . The tiny ormolu clock ticked away at his elbow . He could hear it constantly but it seemed to be no more than an audible pulse in the silence about him . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sure that someone was moving a heavy piece of furniture overhead . His reverie appeared to widen and slide over a fall into rapids where it split into devious flowing streams around jutting rocks and he realized that consistent thought was impossible . He had no conception of how long he had sat at the Queen 's dressing-table holding the scent bottle in his hand and as he turned to put it down he glanced at the clock . It was exactly half-past eleven . And at that moment the door opened and the King appeared clad in a long nightgown and with his own hair standing up like a brush on his head . Louis-David sprang to his feet . The concern which had sobered Louis 's face when he had last been in this chamber had disappeared and in its place was what appeared to be a calm enjoyment of the situation . He greeted Louis-David and went over to the table where some odd clothing still remained and began to dress himself . Louis-David sprang to his assistance . " I have been quite clever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown costume and fitted a grey peruke over his unruly hair . " M. de Lafayette has just left me . I crawled into bed , pulled the curtains , waited until Marquant and Lemoine passed into the next room to disrobe , slipped out and here I am . " He actually chuckled . Louis-David knelt before him and adjusted the dull-buckled shoes . His hands quivered slightly at the task but he noticed that the King 's plump leg did not tremble at all . There is not a nerve in his body , he thought . " There is no danger that they will discover you have gone , sire ? " he asked as he straightened up . " They would not dare touch the curtains , " replied the King . I le thrust his arms into a bottle-green overcoat and picked up a straight-handled cane . " And I left them neatly closed , " he added with another chuckle . " Now then , " he directed as he turned toward the door . " We must make our way to the Hotel du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . " With confident solemn step he passed along the corridor to the small door opening on the Cour des Princes and Louis-David followed him marvelling at his composure . The darkness of the Cour swallowed them and the King thrust his arm through Louis-David 's as they passed slowly toward the archway that led to the Place du Carrousel . An instant after they were in the lighted area where , late as it was , a respectable number of loiterers still passed to and fro , black silhouettes against the sputtering torches . The file of fiacres had thinned out but there were still a fair number of carriageshalted about the large cobbled square . The King , regardless of coachmen , idlers and sentinels , struck in a straight line toward the Rue du Carrousel . He whistled softly Malbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre as he marched along with the steady grave stride of a middleagedman . " Have you ever witnessed Beaumarchais 's Mariage de Figaro ? " he inquired placidly of Louis-David after he had whistled the tune completely through . " No , sire , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say sire , ' " said Louis in a matter-of-fact voice . A small squad of National Guards marched directly toward them and Louis-David was possessed by the overwhelming conviction that he and the King stood out like two abnormal giants in the lighted centre of the Place du Carrousel . " Ah , ah ! " said the King and bent overThe squad marched by . " You did n't fasten my shoe-buckle very well , my friend , " remarkedLouis straightening up . " I hope you are not nervous . " Louis-David choked on the answer he intended to make . They passed up the Rue du Carrousel , the King still whistling softly to himself , and entered the Petite-Place du Carrousel . On one side loomed the dark abandoned stables of the Tuileries . LouisDavidcould see the mutilated figures of the stone horses above the black stone entrance . Near-by , the huge mansions of de Brionne and de La Valliere were brilliantly illuminated . And scattered along the narrow Place half a dozen guinguettes emitted lights , music and bawling voices . At the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maison rneublee that was called the Hotel du Gaillarboisand before it was a fair-sized citadine , a covered carriage that was roomy and ancient . It was toward this place that the two men directed their steps . " It is not unpleasant to wander about the streets in the evening , " remarked the King pensively . " I wish I had done more of it . I should really like to know Paris . "  |p267The  coachman on the citadine got down and came toward them . It was Fersen . " Where is the Queen ? " he asked in an agitated voice . " Oh , she will be along soon , " replied Louis climbing into the carriage and settling himself comfortably . Louis-David saw the two children , now sound asleep , Mme. de Tourzel and another woman whom after a puzzled moment he identified as Madame Elizabeth , sister to the King . IIe turned questioninglytoward Fersen . " Climb up behind , " said the Swedish comte who appeared troubled and exasperated . As Louis-David mounted behind the carriage he heard several exclamations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that she had successfully passed the sentries . She was speaking very clearly to the occupants of the citadine , speaking in a voice that was actually mirthsome and free from care . " M. de Lafayette , " she was saying , " passed so close to me that I put out the switch I carried and let it rattle on the spokes of his carriage . " Louis-David heard the King grunt and then yawn loudly . There was a jolt and the citadine began to move.  |p268IT  WAS not until they had travelled some distance through thedimly-lighted streets that led away from the Petite-Place duCarrousel that Louis-David realized that they were not at allon the road leading toward the Barriere Saint-Martin . They were on the Rue Sainte-Anne . This was curious and Louis-David , aware of muttered exclamations of inquietude from the interior of the citadine , wondered somewhat fretfully whether or not Fersen had mistaken his direction . After all , he was a foreigner and who could say how familiar he was with the bewildering streets of Paris on a moonless night ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the boulevard . Louis-David crouched in his jogglingseat and waited impatiently . He desired violently to be driving the carriage himself . Any action calling for concentration would be a relief from this helpless perch where he now sat listening to the scrape of wheels and the clatter of horses ' hoofs . Fersen did not turn to the right . He drove into the Chaussee-d'Antin ( where Mirabeau had lived and died ) instead . For a moment Louis-David , angry and bewildered , meditated leaping from his seat and running around the carriage to explain his mistake to Fersen . Such a move , however , might arouse curiosity , for there were still occasional pedestrians lurking along the dark streets and military posts at the main crossings . It was wiser to wait , for the volunteer coachman appeared to know where he was going . At least , he glanced to neither the right nor the left but urged his horses forward with constantflirts of the whip . Louis-David , nervously-tensed himself , could imagine the perturbationof the helpless occupants of the citadine . Their one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were rumbling through the very centre of Paris on a sort of midnight tour that was apparently objectless . From all sides came warnings of the sleeplessnessof the metropolis , mysteriously subdued voices , the bang of a shutter , hurried footsteps , that grumbling shudder that surroundsunquiet thousands like an aura . The blank fronts of the houses were like the emotionless visages of watching spies . In the side streets and alleys the darkness seemed to swell and waver asp269though it was compact of lurking figures . And who could tell what was happening back in the Tuileries where a grim-eyed Mme. Rochereuil might be tiptoeing down corridors , peeping into bedchambers , even listening at the drawn curtains of royal beds ? Perhapseven now the warned and aroused emissaries of the Assembly were hurrying to their horses to scour the streets and close the barriers . Any moment the tocsin might begin to ring from the towers of the Hotel de Ville that lugubrious warning that would flood the arteries of Paris with enraged people . Louis-David knew that he was perspiring as these thoughts rushed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fiercely across his forehead . The citadine creaked to an unexpected stop and Fersen , leaping from his driver 's seat , ran over to a house on the left-hand side of the road . They were in the Rue de Clichy near the Jardin Boutin . Louis-David fumbled at his pistols and strained his eyes to see as he heard the muffled knocking of the Swedish nobleman at the closed door . A slip of faint light appeared , there was a short murmur of voices and Fersen ran back to the carriage , mounted the seat and began to turn his horses . The wheels and springs of the citadine screamed and groaned as the awkward bulk half-circled and a moment later they were retracing their way along the Chaussee-d'Antin . What was all this about ? It seemed to Louis-David that hours had been wasted and they were still in the centre of Paris . But now , at least , they were travelling in the right direction . He could hear the agitated voice of Marie-Antoinette inside the carriage and he suspected that she was urgently seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . He crouched on his box and urged his horses forward at a fast pace . The long streets slid slowly by , hotels , houses , shops and cafes passing as though on a reluctantly-drawn ribbon . The way seemed limitless and Louisavidwas beginning to wonder if this vast sprawling monster thatas called Paris would ever have an end , when he was relieved toe against the storm-clouded sky the tall rotunda of the customhousethat marked the Barriere Saint-Martin . Beside it the smaller dwelling of the commander of the barrier was brilliantly illuminated nd a sound of loud laughter and stamping feet issued from it . Itas evident that a celebration of some sort was in progress . Fersen rove directly by this lively hive , the lights from the window fallingrocs the bulk of the citadine , and Louis-David was faintly surprised at half a dozen figures did not come tumbling out the door with Challenging orders to halt . Nothing at all happened and here they were beyond the guarded gates of Paris . Some distance farther in a mass of shadows flung by a clump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's seat and walked back to LouisDavid . He appeared more worried than ever . " The berlin should have met us here , " he said in an agitated voice , " and it is not here . " " Berlin ? " repeated Louis-David in a puzzled tone . " Yes , yes , " explained Fersen in an impatient voice . " You did not think the journey was to be made in this citadine , did you ? The berlin was to be here by one o'clock . It is now two . As you see , there is no berlin . " " Perhaps it was delayed in leaving , " suggested Louis-David as he jumped from his seat and glanced up and down the dark deserted road . " It was n't , " snapped Fersen . " I stopped at Crawford 's house to make sure . It had left three hours ago . " So that was the reason for the roundabout journey to the Rue de Clichy . Louis-David 's legs felt stiff from inaction and he stamped to release the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in an uncertain voice . " It is more likely that a squad of National Guards will turn up , " replied Fersen gloomily . The door to the carriage opened and the King stepped very carefullydown , his back to the two men . There was a murmur of protest from the interior of the citadine . " What is it ? " asked Louis . " What is the matter now ? " " The berlin is not here , " answered Fersen . Louis stared along the sombre stretch of thoroughfare . Then he puffed his lips out and whistled . Lethargically he seemed to be attempting to envisage his situation . " Peste ! " he exclaimed . " That leaves us in a fine predicament . " " Can we not go on in the citadine ? " inquired Louis-David and then immediately realized how foolish was his suggestion . " Without supplies and necessaries of any sort ? " exclaimed Fersen . " It is impossible ! Besides , the passports are made out for a berlin conveying the Baroness de Korff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and see what has happened to the cursed berlin . " " Two hours back and two hours to return would find us where we are  --  just outside the gates of Paris  --  at six o'clock in the morning when the farmers are coming in , " said Louis calmly . " That is impossible . We might just as well return to the Tuileries . I suggest , M. le Comte , that we push on in the citadine a trifle farther.  | " I gave precise orders where the berlin was to await us , " explained Fersen , " but . . . " " His Majesty is right , " interposed Louis-David . " Perhaps the driver of the berlin was uncomfortable because of that noisy celebrationat the barrier . " Fersen stared back in the direction of the brilliantly-illuminated dwelling . Even from where they stood the sound of revelry could he heard . " It is possible , " muttered the Swedish nobleman . Then he turned and walked at a rapid pace into the shadows of the deserted road . The King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling , beside Louis-David and waited . He did not even turn his head when an agitated feminine voice from the citadine called to him . Louis-David moved restively , his boot scraping against the dried gravel . Presently Fersen appeared hurrying out of the darkness , his features transformed . " You are right , sire , " he said to the King . " The berlin is ahead . " Louis began to whistle an air by Gretry . Within a few minutes Fersen had maneuvred the citadine alongsidethe vast bulk of a berlin that rested by the side of the road in the shadow of the trees . While the occupants of the smaller carriage were being transferred to their new quarters Louis-David inspected the conveyance curiously . It was a green-and-lemon-coloured monsterof a vehicle drawn by four horses , its interior upholstered in white Utrecht velvet and a great mass of supplies including linen , silver , wine , a clothes-press , a larder and a commode lashed to its roof and crammed about the seats . For a moment Louis-David imagined that he was observing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked was a chapel and an orchestra of musicians . On the coachman 's box sat de Moustier and astride the lead-horse was a postilion in heavy jack-boots . The royal family once transferred , Fersen and Louis-David mounted the box beside de Moustier , the postilion cracked his short fat whip and the vast conveyance lurched into motion . The citadine was abandoned by the side of the road . In a few rapid sentences de Moustier explained the reasons for passing the spot settled upon for rendezvous and added that de Valory had ridden on to Bondy to arrange for relay horses . Fersen nodded . The abysmal darkness of the night seemed to be slightly lifting in the east and from a farawayfarmyard a cock uttered its first crow . The berlin rolled along thunderously between the colonnades of slim trees . Fersen leaned forward . " Lustily , Balthazar ! " he cried to the postilion . " More quickly !  | Make faster progress ! Hop ! Your horses are not winded ; they are only procrastinating . Lay on the whip ! " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their speed . It was three o'clock when the refugees reached Bondy and LouisDavid , from his high seat , saw beyond the haw-ditch of the chateau the long formal alleys of the park . At the angle of the Chemin SaintDenisbefore the large post-house de Valory was waiting with eight horses , six for the berlin and two for Louis-David and himself . The exchanges were effected quickly , the new postilions leaped to their places and Louis-David , with a vast relief , felt himself in the saddle again . Fersen came over and put his hand on the pommel of LouisDavid'ssaddle . " I propose to leave you here , " he explained . " I shall take de Valory 's winded horse and travel by the traverse road to Le Bourget and follow the route from there to Belgium . In two days I will meet you at Montmedy . For God 's sake , be discreet and make sure that everything goes according to plan . You will be met at Pont-deSomme-Vesleby Choiseul and his hussars , at Sainte-Menehould by a detachment under d'Andoins , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Varennes by sixty hussars , at Dun by an equal cornmandand at Stenay by Bouille himself with the Royal German Regiment . A rumour has been carefully spread that these troops have been concentrated to protect the passage of a shipment of gold . Nothing can go wrong if every man fulfils his appointed duty in this plan . Paris is behind and freedom lies ahead . Farewell , monsieur . " Before Louis-David could respond Fersen had hurried to the window of the berlin and was speaking earnestly to those within . In a moment he drew back and bowed . " Adieu , Mme. de Korff , " he said in a loud voice . The Queen 's forced laugh answered him . Before the berlin could be set in motion again the sound of the hoof-beats of Fersen 's horse could be heard dying away in the dimness . It was exhilarating to trot along by the door of the monstrous conveyance , to hear the sleepy birds chirping in the trees as they wakened to this thunder of passage , to feel the nervous reactions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft gurgle of a hidden river to the right . Louis-David was beginning to believe that the impossiblecould be accomplished . Fersen had laid his plans well . If there were troops to meet them at all crucial points and they travelled with celerity , there was no reason why they should not reach Stenayp273by midnight of this day that was dawning , or , at the most , by the next morning . Then , in the midst of his faithful regiments , the King could dictate to the National Assembly . At every revolution of the massive wheels of the berlin they were that much farther from Paris and that much nearer a new order of things . And here was Claye with de Valory waiting with the new posthorsesand a dusty cabriolet in which sat Mmes . Brunier and de Neuvilleas bewildered and frightened as ever . The horses were changed , the King put his hand in a bag and drew forth a heap of coins with which to pay the posting fees , Mme. de Neuville quavered what imaginary horrors she and her companion had suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of the town , the whips cracked again and off went the procession , de Valory spurring ahead as usual , the cabriolet with three horses attached following , and , last of all , the great berlin creaking with its load of provisions and people . Why , it was like a game ! There was no one to accost them and though the pale dawn was breaking and soon they would see signs of humanity all of them were becoming more and more disabusedof their trepidations and fears . At Meaux , where they stopped before the post-house on the Place Saint-Jacques and saw by the clock that it was just a little before six , the same performance was repeated . Fresh horses were put to the harness and new postilions climbed to their places . It was bright day and the few early risers who gaped at the **28;4046;TOOLONG on wheels merely looked perplexed , scratched their heads and went on their way to the fields . Outside Meaux the King broke into the larder and began to hand about food . He was in excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Lafayette must be devilishly embarrassed by now , " and leaning out of the window to inform Louis-David , " As soon as I get my behind in the saddle again I shall be another man . " The Queen , too , was feeling jovial and she passed out a great piece of pate and a loaf of bread for Louis-David and de Moustier , who , because of his astigmatism , refused a saddle and still rode on the box of the berlin . They were all gay and their gaiety increased when they passed Fertesous-Jouarreat eight o'clock , and , leaving the more travelled road to Dormans , turned into the route to Montmirail . The King had an " Itinerary of the Kingdom of France " spread on his knee and he explained to the children , who had awakened , the roads that they were travelling . Louis-David , glancing into the window once , saw Mine . de Tourzel holding the Dauphin on a pot . There were relays at Bussieres , Vieux-Maisons , Montmirail and Fromentieres and at each halt everything went smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King fumbled in his bag for the fees , the little knots of inquisitive observers stood at a distance and gaped , the sun shone , the birds sang and a comforting breeze agitated the horses ' glossy manes . They were travelling at about three leagues an hour , not an exceptionally fast pace but sufficient to satisfy the fleeing royal family . Tiny incidents relieved the monotony of this incessant journey through the green countryside of Northern France . For a time a horseman who seemed to be persistently followingthem was discussed but eventually he turned into a side road and was seen no more . At one of the posting stops the King descended from his place so that " the ladies would have time to put themselves at ease and satisfy their needs . " At another he descended again and was immediately surrounded by a group of mendicants who whined piteously for alms . Louis-David was about to ride between the King and these beggars when Louis declared that it was not necessary . " My journey seems to me safe from any accident , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tourzel to lead the children into the nearby woodland . It was past midday and the hot sun was high in the sky when they changed horses at Etoges , the first stop after Fromentieres , and rolled on their way toward Chaintrix . Curiously enough , LouisDavid , who had been awake for twenty-nine hours and on horseback for nearly ten , did not feel exhausted at all . So long as the road was clear before him and he could hear the hoofs of his mount pounding along by the side of the berlin he was satisfied . Montmedy was steadily drawing nearer and by tomorrow they would be there and join forces with Fersen again . Before the sun fell he would see the celestial blue and white facings of the pelisses of M. de Choiseul 's hussars . It was astonishing but it was true . Ahead in a cloud of dust rolled the cabriolet containing the two ladies-in-waiting and beside him a big-nosed man with his peruke awry thrust his head out of the coach window and whistled Malbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre and a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very much shaken little boy 's nose with a cambric handkerchief . Yes , by God , it was astonishing . Chaintrix , a small hamlet of some fifteen houses , drew abreast and the berlin lurched to a halt before the post-house . It was exactly two-thirty . A young man who had been standing in the doorway conversing with de Valory ran down the path and helped open the door at which Louis was struggling . As the King stepped down this young man looked up and his blue eyes nearly popped out of his head . He cast a wild glance into the berlin , studied the faces of the two children and dashed back to the post-house with a muffledp275cry of amazement . " The King ! The King ! " they heard him clamouringat the door . Louis-David leaped from his saddle and came hastily forward and Marie-Antoinette with a vexed expression on her face stepped down unaided from the berlin . A burly man , obviously the posting master , and three gabbling women fairly fell out of the door where the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expelled a deep breath . " It was bound to happen sooner or later , " he said to Louis-David , " but it does not matter now . We are only two stops from Pont-deSomme-Veslewhere Choiseul is waiting . " " No , it does not matter , " echoed Louis-David but the unexpected recognition had come as a distinct shock and disappointment to him . The little group from the post-house came hurrying forward , bowing ridiculously as they stumbled over grass and stones and calling out blessings on the King and Queen . For a moment the royal couple assumed that stature of nobility that they had displayed in the old days at Versailles and received the homage of these humble people with a graciousness of bearing that was beautiful to see . They were holding a little extempore court in the hot sun by the yellow post-house . The King listened in an attentive and kindly manner as the stuttering youth explained that he had seen His Majesty and the children at the Feast of Federation on the Champ-de-Mars the year before . " I heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain the Constitution decreed by the National Assembly , " rte babbled . " Yes , yes , " replied the King mildly . Marie-Antoinette broke in upon all these protestations of loyalty to point out that Madame Royale and the Dauphin were suffering from the excessive heat and that she desired to bathe their faces in cold water . The three women , bowing and bobbing as they went , led the Queen , Madame Elizabeth , Mme. de Tourzel and the two children to the shade of the post-house while the posting master , who called himself can-Baptiste de Lagny , and his son-in-law , named Gabriel Vallet , astened about their work of changing the horses , shouting excitedlythe startled postilions and making a great racket . Louis-David , ho had been standing anxiously by , glanced dubiously at de Valory I do Moustier . " This is unfortunate , " he said . Dc Valory shrugged his shoulders . He was exhausted , his face as caked with dust and heavy circles underlined his eyes . " It can not be helped , " he replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may not matter at all , " added de Moustier morosely.  | The three booted men in their saffron couriers ' liveries stood gazing glumly down the road . To noisy backing and loud " haws " the six fresh horses were manoeuvred into place , the heavy harness buckled on them and the straps of the luggage tightened . The Queen , Madame Elizabeth , Mme. de Tourzel and the two children returned to the berlin . Louis , who had been conversing with the two ladies-in-waiting in the cabriolet , stumbled back to the larger vehicle and climbed in heavily after the Queen . With a sigh of relief Louis-David mounted his new horse . De Valory was already galloping up the road in the direction of Chalons . At last , they were ready to go . But there was a delay while young Vallet drew on riding boots . He insisted on taking over the lead-postilion 's saddle , anxiously insistingthat no one but himself was qualified to guide the half-dozen horses of His Majesty the King . When , at length , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife refused to take any fee for their exertions . The Queen , touched with this display of affection , drew two silver bowls out of the luggage and handed them over to Mme. de Tourzel to give to Mme. de Lagny and her daughter . It was to a chorus of exclamations of fidelity that the berlin finally rolled away from the post-house at Chaintrix . Louis-David rode along in the hot sun beside the open window where the King gasped for fresh air . A feeling of foreboding was settling on him . The weariness which the spur of excitement and the thrill of triumph had kept at bay was creeping into his body . It was intensified by the unusual heat of the clay . He began to think that Pont-de-Somme-Vesle was much farther off than it appeared on the map which Louis studied so assiduously . The dust rose about his horse 's trotting hoofs and caused the animal to sneeze . Vallet , the ambitious postilion , was pushing the horses of the berlin as fast as he could and Louis-David began to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay . What was it ? Chalons ? Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud ! Nothing but the eternal sound of hoofs on the dried-out road and the nerve-racking creak of the cumbrous conveyance . God , but it was hot ! The back of his neck was burning and his armpits were soaked with sweat . He was losing the power to grip the slippery saddle-skirts with his thighs . The reek of the horse filled his nostrils . There was a shout and a breaking crash ahead . Louis-David spurred hastily forward and saw that the two leadhorseswere down . He sputtered furiously at Vallet as the excited youth unharnessed them , brought them to their feet and forced them back into the traces . Once again they were off . Louis-David rodep277beside Vallet for some distance angrily urging him not to force his mount so . " Remember , there is a berlin behind them , " he grumbled . The youth became sulky and nervous . Louis-David felt inclined to cuff him and then realized that he must attempt to restrain his temper . Coolness was everything in an adventure like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun ? France had suddenly become like an African desert . And then one of the traces , insecurely fastened , snapped loose . " God in Heaven ! " swore Louis-David , shaking his fist at the sky . At four o'clock they rumbled into Chalons . Louis-David watched suspiciously while the horses were changed and observed that young Vallet conversed excitedly with the postilions and stable-hands . These last began to cast curious glances at the berlin . " The whole countryside will know who we are in an hour , " thought I . ouis-David in a rage . " God curse that stupid little fool ! " By four-thirty they were passing by way of the Porte SaintJacquesinto the route to Metz that would lead them to Pont-deSomme-Vesle . The royal family had kept themselves discreetly concealedin the huge carriage . Perhaps they feared a repetition of the scene that had taken place at Chaintrix . As for Louis-David , the gradual sinking of the sun appeared to cool the fever of irritation and suspicion that had been welling within him . He was decidedly tired now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of calm desperation was animating him . Perhaps it did n't matter that the replaced postilions returning with their horses to Chaintrix were spreading the word right and left that the King had passed . After all , there were forty good hussars ahead and at each posting station farther on additional detachments were waiting . A drumming of hoofs caused Louis-David to turn abruptly in his saddle . A man in a black cloak flashed by on a roan stallion . " Your arrangements will be no good , " he shouted , " you will be opped . " Louis-David watched the flying dust into which the mysterious orseman had disappeared . His eyes were bright with a reckless fever . Stopped , eh ? Well , he would see about that . He felt forhis pistols and retarded his horse until the berlin came abreast ofhim and then trotted along beside the closed door . Presently a lonely farmhouse appeared about a bend in the road . single horseman loitered before it . As the travellers drew nearer uis-David perceived that it was de Valory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached him the berlin was halted , the r opened and the heads of Louis and Marie-Antoinette appeared . " Where are we ? " inquired the King.  | " At Pont-de-Somme-Vesle , " replied de Valory in a haggard voice . " But . . . but . . . " stuttered Louis . " That farmhouse is the posting station , " added de Valory gloomily . " But where is Choiseul ? " cried the Queen in a clear voice . " Gone , " said de Valory . He appeared too exhausted and disappointed to talk . " Gone ! " exclaimed Louis-David . " And the hussars ? " " Look about you , " answered de Valory . " There are none here . " " And the post-horses ? " questioned the King . " There is nothing but an old mare in the field yonder , " explained de Valory . Louis-David glanced about him at the chalky plain and the few windmills that reared their battered arms on the hilltops some distanceaway . The absence of Choiseul and his hussars was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing ? he thought to himself . Aloud he said : " We must push on to Sainte-Menehould without fresh horses . Surely d'Andoins and his detachment will be there . " " It is the only thing to do , " agreed the King in a mournful voice . He sounded as though all the earth had failed him . The Queen began to cry and Louis , drawing hastily back , closed the door to the berlin . " Shall I go on ahead ? " inquired Louis-David of de Valory . The other lifted his head and shook it . " No , " he said . " It is only speed that keeps me awake . " He whirled his horse around and galloped down the road . The tired and grumbling postilions cracked their whips and the great vehicle started on its journey again . This time they were travelling into mystery , for no one knew what would be waiting for them at Sainte-Menehould . If Choiseul had failed them at Pontde-Somme-Vesle , might not d'Andoins do the same at his post ? Spectres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they passed slowly along the dry road . The horses , rebellious at first , had to be whipped into movement by the surly postilions . They had not gone a hundred yards before one of the exhausted leadhorsesdropped to his knees bringing his mate down with him . The second pair stumbled over them and fell also . It took half an hour to get them all on their feet again and the postilions hack in their saddles . The whips cracked , the horses strained and fell for a second time . A postilion was pinned beneath one of them . With Louis-David and de Moustier both aiding , a sort of order was eventuallycreated in all this chaos of struggling beasts . The broken traces were mended and the exhausted animals progressed at a slow walkp279dragging the huge berlin behind them . Louis-David , walking his horse , felt his shoulders sagging and endeavoured only half-heartedly to straighten them . He was as tired as the horses . It was half past six when they reached Orbeval , an isolated house and posting station on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of an hour while de Valory and two surly postilions went out into the fields and rounded up six horses . The only sign of life from the berlin was when the King opened the door and inquired if there were any soldiers at Orbeval . Louis-David shook his head . The King pursed his lips , gazed mournfully at the darkening sky and withdrew into the upholstered interior of the vehicle . When they went on at a faster pace a sad landscape loomed about them . The plain , scattered with rare clumps of bushes , was silent and calm . Upon its height the mill of Vainly turned slowly in the dusk . Far off a dog barked , late hens scolded as the irate cock drove them to their roost and a cow 's bell jangled from a farmyard . The aspect of the country slowly changed and a great pond appeared on their left . Imperceptibly the powdery plain succeeded to green meadows and on the horizon to the east appeared the sombre line of the Argonne hills . Louis-David moved along slowly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of the fertile land and wondering what was waiting in store for them all at Sainte-Menehould . There , at least , they would be in a fairly large place with plenty of people to stand about and stare at them . It was to be hoped that the invisible hussars of Choiseul and d'Andoins would he there , too . According to Fersen the berlin was popularly supposed to be carrying treasure but Louis-David did not doubt but that the rumour of what it actually carried had long ago percolated to the town . No doubt the market-place was already crowded with eager and inquisitive people waiting to see the arrival of the King and Queen of France . And as he pondered this with some misgiving the low bridge and first houses of the Fleurion quarter of Sainte-Menehould appeared iii view before him.  | WITH A rumble like muffled thunder the berlin , preceded by the cabriolet and accompanied by Louis-David , passed through the Rue de la Petite-Auche , swung into the Rue de la Grande-Auche and then debouched upon the lighted square of the Place Royale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel de Ville , came flocking across the cobbled expanse to view with curiosity the towering vehicle with its great mound of top-heavy luggage , the cabriolet drawn by three horses and Louis-David and de Moustier , bright in their saffron-coloured couriers ' liveries . There was a jabber of voices , sharp exclamations and catcalls . Louis-David rode close to the open window where the King , his peruke still misplaced , stared out in mild wonder at the hurrying figures who trooped from all sides . " Ah ! " cried the King in a tone of satisfaction . " Soldiers ! " Louis-David saw to his right a good-sized inn with a swinging sign upon which was painted : " Auberge du Soleil d'Or " and near it a group of men whose olive-green habits with rose facings , white breeches and huge boots proclaimed them to be dragoons . Instinctively , these men , upon perceiving the berlin , snapped to attention and touched their hands to the vizors of their helmets . MarieAntoinette , who was leaning across the King 's shoulder , bowed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The berlin , followed by a jostling crowd speculating in loud voices , turned into the Rue de la Porte-des-Bois and drew up before the posting station where fresh horses held by grooms already pawed the ground . A military officer with a long thin body , a dry face almost obliterated by a huge carbuncled nose and a nervous embarrassedair pushed through the loiterers that circled the new-arrivals . Louis-David , who had dismounted from his horse , heard the exclamationsof these loiterers . " It is the Prince de Conde who is enteringFrance incognito , " exclaimed one of them . And Louis-David realized that the saffron livery he was wearing was that of Conde . The embarrassed officer , who had approached the berlin , exclaimedin a broad Gascon accent to de Moustier , who still sat on the coachman 's box , " Get away as quickly as you can . You are lost if you do not hasten . " He turned to several dragoons who hadp281joined the murmuring spectators and harshly ordered them to reportfor their suppers . One of the dragoons gruffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as they did o harm . While this man , whom Louis-David presumed to be aptain d'Andoins , expostulated with his mutinous men , de Valory bowed his way through the crowd with that authoritative insolence at seemed a part of his nature . He strode immediately to the indow of the berlin where the King leaned out with a puzzled pression and Louis-David followed him . " It looks bad , " said de Valory abruptly , wiping the dust from his cc with his gauntlet . " D'Andoins informs me that forty hussarsf the Regiment de Lauzun , coming from Toul , quitted Sainte-Mene  --  houldfor Pont-de-Somme-Vesle this morning under the command f M. de Goguelat . He is surprised that we did not encounter themd has no idea where they are . He and his thirty dragoons replacedhussars , and the townsfolk , observing the unusual shift of tops , became extremely suspicious . He has quartered his men the Auberge du Soleil d'Or ' much to the anger of the posting ster , Drouet , a surly devil of revolutionary tendencies , whose bles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragoons are noisy . Drouet has been damning them right and left and accusing illette , the proprietor of the auberge , of running a guinguette. e dragoons have been fraternizing with troublemakers all day . Half of them are drunk and none of them are to be depended upon . Main d'Andoins says further that the townsfolk are irritated and a bellicose frame of mind . Therefore he strongly suggests that would be wisest to relay without delay and depart as quickly as possible . " The King considered for a moment , glancing from the worried es of Louis-David and de Valory to the jostling murmuring crowd that was constantly being augmented by newcomers . " Let us get on then , " he said in a hopeless tone . Louis-David was certain that the monarch regarded himself as t . Threatening obstacles always seemed to sap his will and the defection of the troops had seriously unbalanced his equanimity . e has no real faith that he will get away now , thought the Seigneur Tressillac . Nor have I , he added as an afterthought . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooms and postilions changing the horses . They were buckling the last straps into cc when a harsh authoritative voice called over the heads of the mob , . " Do n't kill your horses , postilions , " it cried . " That coach appears to be damned heavy . "  | Louis-David turned quickly and saw a strong-faced , hook-nosed young man of military bearing who was striding down the street . " Drouet , the posting master , " muttered de Valory . " D'Andoins informs me that he served with the dragoons of Conde . " The two tired men glanced at each other . " Do n't think . Do n't worry . Do n't speculate , " said de Valory . " Just ride . I 'll see you , God willing , at Clermont . " He hurried to his fresh horse , mounted it and was off in a flurry of hoofs down the Rue de la Porte-des-Bois . Louis-David had not the heart to approach too near the window of the berlin . He did not want to see that hopeless look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the saddle , fumbled for the leather stirrups and trotted abreast of the lead-horses as the great coach started . A jabbering crowd followed the refugees for some distance . Just as the berlin was entering the road to Clermont Louis-David heard the explosion of a pistolet in the town behind him , and , shortly after , the snarling roll of a drum beating the generalalarm . He shook his head mournfully . The hue and cry was up . Everything depended on , pure chance now . Noisily the procession went on its way , de Valory far ahead on his galloping horse , then the clattering cabriolet containing Mmes . Brunier and de Neuville , and , last of all , the vast conveyance carrying the King and Queen , the royal children and Mme. de Tourzel , with de Moustier on the coachman 's box and Louis-David riding beside the lead-horses . Once the uproar in Sainte-Menehould died behind them it was eerily quiet . The cultivated fields succeeded to woodland and soon , always mounting , they were in the dark heart of the Argonne Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little village of La Grange-aux-Bois with its lightless windows and one deserted street loomed up beneath the great sheltering oaks . Some distance farther on they topped the rise of the enormous swell of land and began the long descent travelling along a narrow road between steep hills obscured in heavy foliage . When the road unexpectedly turned Louis-David saw the valley of Biesme filled with the curling smokes of the evening . The flat roofs of Les Islettes stood like mushrooms in the distance . The descent became steeper and they rolled along between two great sombre croups of the forest merged in the deep night redolent of suspiring leaves . It was ten o'clock when they reached Clermont and groaned to a halt before the ' lighted posting station . De Valory was standing before it in the company of an officer in a forage cap . " This is the Comte de Damas , " he said in his tired voice.  |p283The  officer kept taking his cap off and putting it on again . " But where are your troops , M. the Dragoon ? " called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting the great lanterns with polished reflectors that illuminated both the interior of the berlin and the road ahead . A few idlers gathered about the postingstationdoor to watch the relay . " Yes , " said the King . " Where are your dragoons ? " " Be careful how you raise your voice , " exclaimed Marie-Antoinette , staring suspiciously at the idlers. 1 ) e Valory spoke for the nervous Comte de Damas . " He has just explained to me , " he said , " that his detachment excitedthe bourgeois . Therefore he has lodged a part of them in the neighbouring village of Auzeville . The rest he has here but they are not to be depended upon . The long wait since midday has fatigued the troopers , disquieted the townsfolk and given rise to many rumours . " " I ordered my men to unsaddle and sound the retreat , " added the Comte de Damas , " because I feared a conflict between them and the Clermontais . " The King sighed . " We shall get through all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end and too far from Paris to encounter any serious obstacle now . " IIe turned to the attendant grooms and bade them hurry with the change of horses . Louis turned with pathetic hope to Louis-David . I " Yes , " he said , " we shall get through all right . This is the last f the public relays . At Varennes , Dun and Stenay , Messrs . de Choiseul and de Bouille have provided horses from their private Stables and they are well guarded by strong detachments of hussars . Once beyond Clermont we have no more need , of any dealings with Strangers and as it is so late we shall be seen by very few . " Louis-David expressed a satisfaction he did not feel . If Choiseuld failed at Pont-de-Somme-Vesle there was every possibility thatwould fail at Varennes . As for Bouille , he was at best an unknownquantity . IIe was presumably somewhere with an entire regiment of Royal Germans but nobody seemed able to put fingerthe spot . Yet it was encouraging to find the King in a better frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His attitude would cheer those with him and make the difficultpassage that much easier . The horses were changed and as the travelers were about to draw away from the posting station a dishevelled vinegary-visaged woman appeared at the door and shrilled at the postilions . " Be sure you are returned by dawn with those horses , " she cried . " I shall need them for the haying . " The lead-postilion mumbled something and snapped his whip . De Moustier shouted to the coachman of the cabriolet , " The road to Varennes . " Along the flat thoroughfare the vehicles lumbered . When they traversed the village of Neuvilly Louis-David saw that every light was out . The little settlement slept serenely under the dark sky ignorant and regardless of fleeing kings and the woes of the great . UnwillinglyLouis-David permitted that hope that he had recognized in Louis 's words to creep into his own mind . Perhaps they would get away , after all . It was not too impossible . Though there was perturbationand disaffection behind them , drunken troopers being seduced by indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tocsins ringing from towers , there was no one as yet who had actually dared to halt them . And it was not unreasonable to suppose that the same hesitation would be found at the next three haltingplaces . The populace might be indignant but it would not dare to act without express authority and there was no chance of that authority catching up with them , for it would have to come from Paris . Once Varennes , Dun and Stenay were passed , then , the dangerousgame was won . Louis-David began to feel better . He saw a house , black and shuttered , on his left . Two more loomed above their high walls to the right . A stretch of hedge . A garden wall . More houses , all shuttered and dark as the hollows in the Argonne Forest . And de Valory , leading his horse and holding up the other hand . The berlin creaked to a halt and LouisDavidheard the door of it open and the steps let down . " What is the matter ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Valory succinctly . There was a grating of feet on the pebbles and the King came into the light of the lanterns . " Where is the relay ? " he inquired . " I  --  ca n't find it , " answered de Valory . Louis clicked his teeth . He glanced about him . " The posting station should be about here , " he said in a puzzled voice . He walked over to the left of the road to a row of low houses and Louis-David , who followed him , saw a half-obliterated sign above one of the doors reading , " Maison de Poste . " " Here it is , " said the King.  |p285The  house seemed to be hermetically sealed . Louis pounded on the door with his fist . There was no answer . He struck again , demanding in a loud voice , " Is n't it here that the horses are ? " After a long pause a voice from the interior responded , " Get on your way . We do n't know what you want . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berlin and explained the situation to the Queen . " But there should be sixty hussars here , " she exclaimed . " Why does n't the commander of them show himself ? Why has n't the relay been prepared ? This was the place settled upon . " The postilions , who were not paid to go farther , began to murmur among themselves . It was late and they wanted to get back to Clermont in good season . Louis-David left the King clumsily eneavouringto quiet the fears of the Queen and walked slowly down he dark road in the faint hope of securing some information . Deglory was already prowling about the side lanes and gardens in hopeless search for the missing post-horses . To Louis-David 's right he noticed the door of a large house ajar and a stream of light ' suing from the crack . He ran up the steps and put his hand out only to have the door suddenly slammed in his face . Angrily he ung his weight against it and it crashed open again revealing a startled old man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough to indicate to me the road leading to Stenay ? " he asked in a furious voice . " I will do it willingly , " said the old man , " but I will be lost if anybody knows of it . " " I hope you are too honest not to help a lady in distress , " replied Louis-David dryly . " We know very well who it is , " murmured the old man . " It is of only a lady . . . " Louis-David , too astonished and puzzled to say more , gripped the old man by the arm and led him toward the berlin . When he appeared in the doorway with his nightcap sticking up like a single urn Madame Royale , who had awakened , uttered a terrified scream . he Dauphin continued to slumber serenely . The old man , plainly If-frightened out of his wits , babbled mysteriously that he knew secret but could not reveal it . There was something sinister in his phrases . " Do you know the Baroness de 1 ( orff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man shook his head . " No , " he said , " but I know a secret . "  | " Well , " exclaimed the King impatiently , " at least you will conduct my courier to the barracks of the hussars . " The old man agreed to do that . " It is in the ci-devant convent of the Cordeliers , " he said to Louis . David , indicating a sloping street to the left . " What is your name ? " demanded Louis-David as he walked along beside him . " Prefontaine , " replied the old man , and then proudly , " I am a Chevalier of St. Louis . " His bare feet slapped heavily on the earth . " And what is this secret that agitates you so ? " questioned LouisDavid . The ancient fairly trembled , his nightcap shaking like a treetop in a wind . " Ah , " he said , " that I can not say . I should be compromised , exposed , lost , if I told anyone . " The dark front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockings a young German soldier , heavy-eyed with sleep , appeared in the door . He knew nothing except that his officer , now absent , had stationed him in this deserted building . Despairingly Louis-David retraced his steps to the berlin , the old man trotting along by his side . There a council was going on . De Valory had exhausted the countryside and found no sign of horses . The best thing seemed to be : to push on into the Lower Town across the river Aire ( they were now on the outskirts of the Upper Town ) and seek information at the " Auberge du Grand Monarque . " If there were no relays there they would have to push on without one . When this was broached to the postilions they protested energetically . The spokesman for them , a youth named Renaud , complained that the rules did not permit them to double the post , that they were ignorant of the roads beyond Varennes and that Mme. Canitrot , their patronne , would raise the devil with them if they did n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After some discussionand the hint of a generous pourboire they agreed , however , to travel as far as the " Auberge du Grand Monarque " on the other side of the river but still within the limits of Varennes . While this arrangement was being completed one of the postilions , a boy called Arnould , cried out that he heard two post-horses galloping by on a parallel road . " Two nags , " he insisted . " My ears do not fool me . " " Why should post-horses be galloping about the roads at eleven o'clock at night ? " exclaimed Renaud contemptuously . The berlin was put in motion again , Louis-David and de Valory riding ahead side by side , and to much screaming of brakes it beganp287the fairly steep descent to the bridge that led to the Lower Town . ( ; lancing back once Louis-David saw the old man , his nightcap standing up straight on his head , watching their progress from his doorway . Across the river there seemed to be an unusual number of lights for so late an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ominous atmosphere about Varennes ; mysteriousthings were happening ; a very quickening of the night air came like a warning . Louis-David wondered if there were peering eyes behind all these closed shutters and if stealthy hands were soundlesslyturning doorknobs . He rode along expecting something monstrousto happen . They had passed an ancient cemetery close-clusteredwith stones and tombs and were about to pass beneath an archway that vaulted the road and was part of a church when it happened . A group of men , armed with muskets , dashed out from the shadow of the archway with a sharp , " Halt ! Stop where you are or we will fire ! " Louis-David 's nervous horse pranced in a frightened circle and while he was trying to control it he heard de Valory cry , " What is the idea of this unqualifiable violence against peaceable travellers ? " As Louis-David , his horse quieted , dismounted he heard the scraping of the cabriolet coming to a stop and the sharp cries of the postilions reining in the animals hitched to the berlin . The brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed to de Valory who was jumpingfrom his mount . De Valory did not answer but strode toward the armed men . " What do you want ? " he demanded . " Is it not lawful to travel y night ? Be so good as to remove yourselves from the centre of the road . " A bald-headed man wearing a greatcoat over his nightshirt and olding a lantern in his hand answered him . " I am Sauce , the public prosecutor of this commune , " he said in n excited voice , " and I demand to see your passports . " I lc strode past the two dismounted men without waiting for the sponse and thrust his head into the cabriolet . " Your passports , if you please , " he said . The quavering voice of Mme. de Neuville answered that the occupantsof the second carriage had them . In a moment the berlin was surrounded by a mingled group of citizens and National Guards who poured out from beneath the archay . Mme. de Neuville and Mme. Brunier , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  grim-faced suspicious men and explained hysterically through the open window what was demanded . Mme. de Tourzel handed out the passports . " Get this business through quickly , " said the dry restrained voice of Marie-Antoinette . " We are in haste to complete our journey . " There was no sign or word from the King . Mme. Brunier received the passports , her hand shaking visibly as she took them . Sauce and two of the men bearing muskets pushed her and Mme. de Neuville , who was clinging to her arm , toward a nearby cafe that bore the name : " Bras d'Or , " in great letters over its door . The rest of the band formed themselves into a wide circle about the berlin . Louis-David , obeying his instinct after noticing that de Valory and de Moustier had stationed themselves before the door to the huge vehicle , followed the frightened ladies-in-waiting into the cafe . He noticed as he passed the gathering crowd that severalintoxicated hussars , their Teutonic faces emptied of all intelligence , were observing the unusual scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met his gaze . The room was crowded with men in all stages of drunkenness from mere lively tipsiness to sodden sleep . Before the huge fireplace , now mercifully emptied of blazing logs , stood the bald-headed Sauce studying the passports which Mme. Brunier had just handed him . Over his shoulder peered two or three men in homespun coats . The two ladies-in-waiting stood timorously to one side , their arms about each other 's waists for moral support . Louis-David advancedtoward them , prepared to say something comforting , when he stopped with a start of recognition and amazement . To one side of Sauce with arms folded across his chest and wearing ridingbootsstood Drouet , the posting master of Sainte-Menehould . InstinctivelyLouis-David realized that here was the cause of all their troubles . Drouet , suspicious or certain of the occupants of the berlin , had cut through the Argonne Forest by a shorter way to head them off at Varennes . He had roused the town and laid a trap . The postilion Arnould had been right when he had sworn that he heard the hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , of course , had been Drouet riding in fanatical zeal to destroy his King . Louis-David could hardly remove his accusing eyes from the semi-triumphant , semi-vindictive face of Drouet . The man stood there like a proud angel of evil tidings . Sauce looked up with a perplexed pout . " Why , there is nothing the matter with these passports , " he exclaimed " ' they are quite in order . They are signed by de Simolin , the ambassador from Russia , and they enumerate the Baroness de Korff , her steward Durand , a governess , Mme. Rochet , two children ,  |p289a  personal maid and three couriers . There is no reason to prevent this party from continuing on its way . " He turned to Drouet . " You have brought us all out on a false alarm , " he added reproachfully . The pulses in the posting master 's temples throbbed visibly , and his eyes flashed . " I am absolutely certain that it is the King and his family , " he cried in a loud heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a foreigncountry you will be guilty of high treason ! " He turned to the men beside Sauce . " I know what I am talking about , " he exclaimed . " This news has been carried by postilions all the way from Chaintrix where the King was recognized by a lad who saw him at the Feast of Federation . If I had known in time I would have held them at SainteMenehould . There is no doubt about it . I appeal to you as good citizens of France , as patriots , to accept my word . Do you think I would act lightly in a matter like this ? Do you think that I have ridden from Sainte-Menehould to play a trick on you ? Do you think that I blocked the bridge to the Lower Town with a furniture van half an hour ago because of a mere suspicion ? I appeal to you ! " There was a murmur of indecision from the uncertain men . They believed and yet they did not believe . Sauce scratched his bald poll , pursed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much for him . " At least , we can keep them here till the morning , " suggested one of the men by the fireplace . This seemed a solution of sorts to Sauce and after some further conversation and hesitation he agreed to it . There was a scraping of feet and the arguing group poured out of the " Bras d'Or " and into the Rue de la Basse-Cour where both the berlin and the cabriolet were now drawn up opposite the inn . Louis-David , mixing with the others , found himself before the open window of the great carriage . The crowd had increased greatly . Sauce lifted his lantern and peered perplexedly at the King and Queen . It was obvious that he had never seen them before . " You must descend , " he said . " I will vise your passports in the morning . " A murmur of protest came from the interior of the berlin , a murmurin which were mingled the excited voice of Mme. de Tourzel , the clipped commanding tones of Marie-Antoinette and the bewilderedgrumble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business affairs , " ex- claimed the Queen , " and , be very sure , the municipality of Varennes will be responsible for it . " " We shall see , tomorrow morning , " mumbled Sauce . The Queen 's raised voice drowned out a speech that the King started to make . " I tell you it is impossible for us to remain here overnight , " she cried angrily . " I have important affairs to attend to . I am late now . I must make all speed . . . " " We shall see , tomorrow morning , " repeated Sauce wiping his forehead . Marie-Antoinette , her face flushed and her eyes glittering , continued to protest in a loud unhappy voice . Sauce kept on polishing his perspiring forehead and interjecting his one statement . Several times Louis-David was tempted to interfere but de Valory 's restraininghand on his arm consistently warned him that any display of temper might obliterate what little chance remained of getting away even at so delayed a time as the next day . He had to stand silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small-town official unconsciously change the course of French history . " Look , " said Sauce at last . " Your horses can not go any farther without refreshment ; the roads are extremely bad ; the night is so black that you can not see your hand before your face . No , no . We shall see , tomorrow morning . " The King , who had attempted to interject remarks several times only to be immediately hushed by the Queen and whose large face was slowly turning purple , leaned suddenly out of the window and bawled at the postilions , " Get on your way ! Whip up the horses ! " A dozen muskets flashed in the light of the lanterns . " Not a step or we will open fire ! " replied a man in the shadows beyond the lead-horses . It was the voice of Drouet . From the Hotel de Ville , which the refugees had passed shortly after entering Varennes , the lugubrious tocsin began to sound and a moment later the bell in the nearby church sounded its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the windows , doors were thrown open and a murmur of voices agitated the air . The crowd about the stalled carriages was perceptibly swelling and the thud of many running feet could be heard on the boards of the bridge below . The jackals were gathering to regard the defenceless lion . Louis-David glanced apprehensively about him . He saw that already the bored postilions had dismounted and were beginning to unharness the horses preparatory to taking them back to Clermont . He felt the butts of his pistols and longed to use them , to shoot his way through this mob of ugly-tempered citizenry who merely sus/petted or pretended not to know . Where in the name of God were all the hussars ? Drunk , probably , like the few he saw loitering about the berlin . And where were Choiseul and Bouille and all those officers whose positions had been so admirably planned by Fersen ? Hiding in corners , he supposed , or incapable of perceiving what was happening right under their noses . He would give his soul for a score of leather-faced fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained himself from quivering brutally with rage . " Where do you expect us to pass the night , monsieur ? " the Queen was inquiring in a frigid voice that shook only a trifle . Sauce , in unctuous and placating tones , begged to put his house at their disposal . It was just opposite , facing the " Auberge du Bras d'Or . " If Madame would descend . . . Madame did descend , turning to receive her sleeping son from the arms of the false Mme. Rochet and walking sturdily after the lean Sauce whose bare legs flickered under his greatcoat . The King followed , his head lifted far back and his eyes darting angrily about the sea of faces that watched him . Then came Mme. de Tourzel leading Madame Royale whose eyes were heavy and swollen . The two fluttering ladies-in-waiting had returned to the " Bras d'Or " probablyfeeling themselves safer among the intoxicated than the irate . Louis-David , de Valory and de Moustier walked at the rear of this procession forming a much-elbowed guard against the press of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to Sauce 's house and when they reached it Louis-David saw that it was a grocery store with a floor and a half above it . " You are in business , I perceive , " remarked the Queen dryly as she stepped across the splintered sill into the shop where all the joists were furnished with hanging candles . " Yes , madame , " replied Sauce , holding up his lantern so that all could avoid tripping over the lintel . " If you will mount the stairs you will find a chamber at your disposal . " As Louis-David , the last to enter the house , stepped into the candlefestoonedshop he heard the sudden beating of a drum in a nearby street . The sound of it mingled horribly with the clashing of the bells and the cries of the mob . All the world seemed to be awake and concentring on Sauce 's grocery shop in the Rue de la Basse-Cour . Drouet had done his work well . He bowed his head , to avoid knockingit against the low landing , and mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of him . All the mice were in the trap at last.  | THEY WERE all in a little room . On an untidy bed to one side slept the Dauphin , his fists clenched , and by him lay his sister . Mme. de Tourzel sat near them in a rush chair , her hands lifted to cover her face . A table , upon which was a loaf of bread , a bottle of wine and three cracked glasses placed there by Mme. Sauce , stood in the middle of the chamber and resting against it was Madame Elizabeth , the King 's sister , patient and resigned and silently watching the others . Marie-Antoinette , who was extremely nervous , was walking rapidly back and forth like some caged and indignant beast . The King had planted himself by the closed window . In rush chairs ranged against the farther wall reposed the three pseudocouriers : de Valory with his head fallen forward on his chest in exhaustion , de Moustier absently picking his nails , Louis-David leaning back and staring at the melted wax that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning . The bald-headed self-conscious Sauce , carrying his authority with a guilty air , had withdrawn some time before , apparently seized by a sudden inspiration , and the unfortunate refugees were undisturbed for the moment except for the occasional cough and thump as the two National Guards on sentry duty outside the door rested their muskets . An atmosphere of despair and intense weariness permeated the room . Louis , a corpulent dejected figure in his wrinkled grey costume , his bottle-green frock-coat still buttoned about him and his short peruke , appeared to be listening to the noises in the street , a melange of hammering feet , cries , beating drums , bells and rumbling cart-wheels . Suddenly he uttered an exclamation . LouisDaviddiverted his eyes from the tilted candles to the King 's changed face . " Yes , yes , " he exclaimed . " Do you not hear them ? They are troops ! They are the hussars ! We are saved ! " And Louis-David , listening intently with the others , heard a reverberanceof horses ' hoofs that sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones of officers ' voices . A wave of excitement swept across the room . Marie-Antoinette , who had paused in her incessant prowling , rested her hand on the King 's armp 293as she listened . The colour of her face perceptibly changed from a pallid white to a rosy glow . " You are right , sire , " she cried . " It is cavalry that we hear . " A stumbling of steps echoed in the hall and Louis took a step forward toward the door , an expression of anticipatory pleasure on his face . Louis-David impulsively rose to his feet . The door opened and Sauce entered accompanied by a bewildered old gentleman whose gaping clothes revealed the fact that he had just dressed in a tremendoushurry . Behind this couple crowded half a dozen men wearing the sashes of officials of the commune . " This is one of the judges of the Tribunal , " stated Sauce in a Hurried voice . " He is M. Destez . He has visited Versailles often . Ile . . . " A shocked silence fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered into the King 's face . Then he sank to one knee . " Ah , sire ! " he cried in a voice choked with emotion . Louis appeared to struggle with himself for a minute . Then he lifted his hands . " Well , yes , " he said in a voice of surrender . " I am your King . " There was an instant of painful suspense and then Louis embraced Destez . He embraced Sauce . He embraced the officials of the commune who crowded about him . He seemed in a mood to embrace all the world . Marie-Antoinette was in a state of extreme agitation and the other women were openly weeping . " I fled from Paris , " said the King , " because my dear family was exposed to perils every day . We have dwelt long enough in the midst of poignards and bayonets and we have come to find refuge among our faithful subjects . " Everybody began to talk at once and in a twinkling the King seemed to be the centre of a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commune , for the moment emotionally transported , agreed to anything . Of course , the King could go on to Montmedy . Who would dare to stop him ? Naturally he could leave at dawn . Ile would be assigned an escort of fifty hussars and fifty National ( ; cards . Louis began to glance significantly and triumphantly at Marie-Antoinette but she did not seem to partake of his optimism . The flush was dying from her cheeks and her eyes darted uncertainly about the crowded room , studying the excited faces and then turning ever toward the door where the bayonets of the guards on duty glittered in the candlelight . There were heavy footsteps approaching ! that entrance . And then Choiseul , Choiseul the long-awaited , booted , spurred ,  |p294rattling  his sabre and presenting a grim visage , stepped across the sill accompanied by Goguelat and the Comte de Damas . Overawed by these heavily-armed officers carrying so arrogantly their air of authority , the representatives began to withdraw , passing hurriedly through the ceremony of kissing hands with the King and Queen and shuffling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited by this opportune arrival but Louis , still under the spell of the protestations of loyalty from the Varennois , appeared to have lost his enthusiasm for the troops . He accepted the homage of the military with a gracious air but continued to beam happily upon the vanishing officials of the commune . " And now ! " exclaimed the Queen when Sauce had finally withdrawnfrom the chamber , the last of his bowing and scraping group . Choiseul spoke in an angry voice . " I propose , " he said , " to order a cavalry charge against that canaille in the streets and clear the way for Your Majesties ' de-parture . " " Oh , no , no ! " cried Louis . " The municipality has promised to facilitate our journey to Montmedy in the morning . It is quite unnecessary to shed any blood . " Choiseul smacked his heavy gauntlets together . " The municipality ! " he scoffed . " They have no authority . It is that mob of rascals bawling in the street that will decide whether you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength now . " " He is right , Louis , " said the Queen in a choking voice . The King shook his head stubbornly . " No bloodshed , " he repeated . " Bouille is only nine leagues away at Stenay . He is sure to have heard of this contretemps by this time and I expect him to appear very soon with his army corps . It is better to be patient . " " You hope , you expect , you are patient , " cried the Queen as the tears streamed down her face , " and all the while we are lost . M. de Choiseul is right ! Sauce and those shabby fellows can not speak for the mob any more than that abominable Lafayette could speak for his precious National Guard on the fifth of October . Do you not realize that the town is filled with enrages who are fomenting disloyaltyon every corner ? " " No bloodshed , " repeated the King . " Except our own ! " exclaimed the Queen loudly . " Besides , " added Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust the hussars . They all seem drunk to me . " " That is easily found out , " said Goguelat and bowing quickly he whirled on his heel and left the room . The King turned to peer outp 295of the closed window and Choiseul and de Damas began to converse with the Queen , describing the vicissitudes of the day while MarieAntoinettetersely outlined the misfortunes of the berlin . Mme. de Neuville and Mme. Brunier crept into the chamber like two mice and sat down near Mme. de Tourzel . Madame Royale moved and shuddered in her sleep but the little Dauphin , his hands still clenched , remained immobile . There was a pistol-shot outside and the King immediately thrust the window open and leaned out . A bedlam of noise ascended from the street , cries of " Vive le roil Vive la nation ! Vive Lau un ! Vivent les hussards ! " and the resoundingthud of a drum . Louis saluted with his hand and withdrew his head . " The hussars are fraternizing with the people , " he explained , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray shot . Anyway , he waved to me and shook his head while they were leading him into the Bras d'Or . ' There was an air of I-told-you-so about Louis at this moment that was curiously ludicrous . Louis-David , standing stiffly to one side and waiting patiently to be addressed , recognized again the benign indecision of the King . He was like an uncertain paterfamilias who hoped for the best but ever sought the easier way . Good-hearted and constantly temporizing because of his excellent nature , he possessedno strength of character and instinctively recoiled from any drastic gestures . He should have been a small mechanic in a small town with a cottage and a workshop and not a king at all . It was pitiable to see him now assuming a phlegmatism that the situation slid not warrant and so endangering himself as well as all those with him . The Queen turned to him with a final appeal . " See , Louis , " she said earnestly . " It is dawn . It is after five o'clock . It is the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you will not attempt to use the troops , at least insist upon the promises of the people . " The King glanced out the window . It was true . A rosy dawn had broken over Varennes and the clear air outlined the sharp roofs of the houses opposite . The long night of foreboding had passed and it was another day . Louis glanced from the brightening vista to Marie-Antoinette and then to the sleeping children on the untidy bed . " You are right , " he said . " It is dawn . " He thrust his head out of the window into the noisy street and called down . " Harness the horses to my carriage , " he called.  | The babble of voices slackened for a moment and then there was a loud contemptuous laugh . " To Paris ! " shouted an unseen man in burly tones . The Comte de Damas , who had left the Queen , leaned out beside Louis . " Attention ! " he shouted . " It is your King who speaks to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " The King is departing immediately for Montmedy , " persisted de Damas . There was a loud bedlam of screaming voices . " No , no , Paris ! To Paris ! They came from Paris ; let them return there ! " Above this raucous bellowing sounded a clear and menacing ultimatum . " To Paris , or we will open fire on his carriages ! " Louis-David recognized the voice of Drouet . The King and de Damas withdrew their heads from the window and turned to the others who were standing silently about the room . There was complete despair on every face . " You see , " said the King brokenly . " It is hopeless . We must return to . . . " " Do not mention that word , " exclaimed Marie-Antoinette through her tears . " Well , well , " muttered Louis . " We are quite deserted , it seems . " He gazed vacantly at Louis-David for an instant and then walked slowly to a rush chair by the table and sat down in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . Choiseul cleared his throat but said nothing . De Valory , his head on his breast , still slept in the chair by the wall , the only one in the room besides the children who had no idea of what was transpiring or what decisions were being arrived at as the warm June sun cast its morning rays slantingly over Varennes . There came a timid scratching at the door and de Damas stepped quietly over to it and threw it open . An old woman , an octogenarian , almost blind , her scant hair bound in a little bun on her head , stood there leaning on a homemade cane . She peered bewilderedly from side to side , her compressed toothless mouth moving silently . " What is it , grandmother ? " inquired de Damas in a surprised tone . She swallowed several times before she was able to speak . " The King , " she quavered in a voice that was as faint and worn out as an old viol string . " Yes , the King is here , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , still **26;4076;TOOLONG about her and speaking soundlessly with her thin lips . " They told me the King was here , " she mumbled . " And the Queen , too . And the little holy children . I have walked all the way from the next village to see them and bless them . I am over eighty years old and I have never been to Paris . They tell me it is a fine great city with many coaches in the streets . I am the grandmotherof Sauce the grocer . I was born under the Grand Monarque and I shall die under Louis Sixteenth . Where is the King ? " De Damas looked questioningly at Louis who had ceased to regard the loaf of bread and was now staring with gentle pity at the old woman . He nodded and the Comte de Damas offered his arm to the unexpected visitor and led her slowly over to the table . She peered into Louis 's face with her old faded blue eyes . " Ah , God be praised , " she sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her tired ancient mouth . " My good woman , " murmured the King . " I am very happy to see you . " She rose slowly to her feet supported by her gnarled cane . " And the Queen ? " she said . De Damas was about to lead her to Marie-Antoinette but the Queen came forward hastily and took the old woman 's hands in both her own . The cane struck sharply on the floor as it fell . " It was twenty-one years ago , " whispered the grandmother of Sauce the grocer , " that I travelled to Chalons to see you when you came from Austria . I saw the children in white bearing flowers on the Place and the coach stopped and you leaned out and smiled . God bless your Majesty and give you long years to reign over us . " " Here are my children , " said Marie-Antoinette in a trembling voice , as , her arm about the old woman , she led her to the bed ' where the Dauphin and Madame Royale slept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , the toothless mouth moved convulsively and then the grandmother of Sauce dropped painfully to her knees , buried her face in the covers and began to weep silently in the exhausted manner of old people who meet a climax that is too great for them . Her thin shoulders shook and her clawlike hand plucked at the rough blanket that had been thrown loosely over the slumbering Dauphin . After a moment de Damas stepped forward and gently lifted the visitor to her feet , handed her the dropped cane and led her slowly toward the door . The old woman , her lips still moving and the tears streaming down the myriad wrinkles of her checks , was quite speechless as she passed out into the hall where the bored National Guards leaned on their muskets . De Damas softly closed the door and walked over to the window.  | " I still have my faithful people , " said the King in a sober voice . Nobody answered . Marie-Antoinette stood watching the slumbers of her children and de Damas and Choiseul stood near the window gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rue de la Basse-Cour . De Valory slept in his chair by the wall and Mme. de Tourzel , Mme. de Neuville and Mme. Brunier formed a despondent little group on the far side of the table from the King . Louis-David loitered by the door , an emotion of sad futility increasingthe weariness that was now crying out in all his bones . It was nearly six o'clock and he had been on his feet for forty-seven hours , a period of time that would sap the vitality of even the most hardy man . He was beginning to think that this nightmare would go on forever . The King moved his head slowly . " There is nothing to do but return to Paris , " he said . His voice was like a funeral bell . Sauce 's head came timidly around the door . " Sire , " he began , clearing his throat noisily to conceal his embarrassment , " the Representatives from Paris . . . " The King 's chair scraped loudly as he thrust it back and stood up . Marie-Antoinette shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gripped it . A man in the smart uniform of the Parisian guard , blue tunic with red breast-plate and silver-fringed epaulets , pushed by Sauce into the room . His boots were white with dust . " Rayon , commander of the seventh battalion of the National Guard of Paris , " he said nervously . " Sire , you know . . . I am from Paris . . . the city is in insurrection . . . our wives . . . our children are being massacred , perhaps . . . you must not go farther . . . sire . . . in the interests of the State . . . yes , sire , our wives . . . our children . . . " The Queen suddenly grasped him by the dusty sleeve of his tunic and led him toward the sleeping children . " Am I not a mother , also ? " she demanded . " Come to the point , " exclaimed the King , frowning at the gasping officer . " What do you desire ? " " Sire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stuttered Bayon . " Well , well , where is it ? " asked Louis , impatiently shrugging his shoulders . " My comrade has it , " answered Bayon , recovering a measure of aplomb with some difficulty . He pointed to the door where a second officer in the uniform of the Paris National Guard was just entering . Behind him hoveredp 299half a dozen curious faces of Varennes municipals . The Queen uttered an exclamation of horror when she saw the newcomer . " What , M. Romeuf , is it you ? " she exclaimed . " Ah , I would not have believed it possible ! " M. Romeuf was practically speechless and he avoided the Queen 's eyes as he handed a sheet of paper to the King . Louis snatched it and read hastily in a loud voice : " The enemies of the Revolution having kidnapped the King , the hearer is charged to warn all good citizens . He is ordered , in the name of the country in danger , to take the King from the hands of these enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly . While awaiting the government to assemble I take upon myself the responsibility of the present order . Paris , June 21 , 1791 . This order includes all the royal family . " Louis glanced indignantly about him . " The order is signed by Lafayette , " he added , and then , in a heartbrokenvoice , " There is no longer a King in France . " He handed the decree to the Queen who glanced at it furiously ' and thrust it back into his fingers . Absent-mindedly Louis tossed it on the bed . Immediately the Queen snatched it up . " I will not have it soil my children ! " she cried and flung it on the floor . There was an instantaneous murmur of anger from the fringe of heads in the doorway and several bayonets were thrust into the light of the candles . Choiseul , with a rapid gesture , stooped , picked up the decree and placed it on the table . Marie-Antoinette , stood tense while the King , after a startled glance at her , took both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of the room where he entered into earnest conversation with them . Louis-David could not take his eyes from Marie-Antoinette . She stood like a thwarted tigress between the bed where lay her children and the scowling visages that were peering around the door . Her face was extraordinarilypale , her eyes filled with a strange fire and a tiny drop of blood appeared on her chin dropping from her bitten lip . For an instant a horrible magnetic force caused her to sway tautly back and forth and then with a convulsive effort she recovered herself , the rigour of despair and anger left her body and a calculating look appeared in her eyes . She glanced about the room and saw Louis-David staring at her . She returned his stare steadily for a full minute and then her lips formed the word , " Monsieur . " He walked casually over to her . Without looking at him now but watching the slightest move of the National Guards in the chamber , she began to speak . " You see , monsieur , to what a pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried voice . " Will you aid me ? There is no one but you now . De Valory is half-dead . De Moustier can not speak English . I have no faith in Choiseul and his officers . See you , you must get away , monsieur . I do not know how you can manage it but you must make the attempt . You must make Montmedy and meet the Comte de Fersen and describe to him all that has happened . Tell him that he is to blame not at all but that the very stars in their courses were set against us . This is important and you must not forget it . Touch my hand , monsieur , and take the ring that I am holding . Give it to the Comte de Fersen . He will know what it means . Tell him if I never see him again . . . never . . . " Her voice broke off for an instant while she fought against a rising sob . " That is all , monsieur , " she continued . " Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my hopes will be with you . " She turned to Mme. de Tourzel and Louis-David walked over to de Moustier . " I am going to make an attempt to get away , " he said in a low voice . " Have you powers of invisibility ? " murmured de Moustier , peering at him with his myopic eyes . Louis-David shook his head . " No powers but my determination , " he answered . He was about to say more when he noticed Choiseul and de Damas moving toward the door and deliberately followed so close to them that he almost trod on their boots . The crowd in the hall parted grumblingly for the three men who passed down the stairs , through the grocery shop and into the street . Louis-David felt unpleasantly conspicuous in the yellow livery he wore , and , acting on a sudden inspiration , climbed into the berlin , now surrounded by a gaping crowd , removed the vest and got out on the other side clad only in his white waistcoat . Nobody appeared to notice him for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rue de la Basse-Cour was crammed from end to end with armed bourgeois , National Guards , hussars , dragoons and a few stupidlookingRoyal Germans in felt busbies and immense sabretaches of sheepskin . It would be a delicate problem to get through this mob without being accosted or arrested . Already he could hear murmurs of suspicion and anger about him , not directed at him , to be sure , for he seemed to have avoided particular notice in the general excitement , but aimed at the royal family in Sauce 's house . " They do not want to leave , " exclaimed one man , and another added , " Ah , they expect Bouille and they are waiting for him , " P 301 " If they wo n't go we 'll force them into their carriages and drag them back to Paris ourselves , " swore an enormous National Guard and the group about him roared a savage assent . " Bouille 's advance guard is at Montfaucon , " shouted a young man who had climbed up on the box of the berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , " To Paris ! To Paris ! To Paris ! " There was a trampling of hoofs and postilions appeared leading post-horses , pushing with difficulty through the closely-packed people . LouisDavidwas swept back with the rest and he watched gloomily while the fresh animals were harnessed to the berlin and the cabriolet . A detachment of soldiers formed a guard about these vehicles making a free space that extended to the door of Sauce 's grocery shop . There was a long wait while the sun flowed ever more warmly into the street and then ( it was about half past seven ) an activity of movement manifested itself at the door of the grocery shop . The crowd surged forward and was held in check with great difficulty by the expostulating National Guards . Louis-David saw the bared head of Choiseul . And there was de Moustier and de Valory , the last pale as death with great black circles beneath his eyes , climbing to the box of the berlin . They were still garmented in their yellow couriers ' vests and they immediately became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed against the crossed muskets of the National Guards . A moment later the King , his face calm , still the bonhomrne , walked rapidly from the door of the grocery shop to the berlin and climbed into the white upholstered interior . A scattered cry of " Vive le roil " went up . MarieAntoinettefollowed in a half-fainting condition , leaning heavily onChoiseul 's arm . Madame Elizabeth appeared accompanied by theComte de Damas . Last of all came the two children , one on each side of Mme. de Tourzel , and Mmes . Brunier and de Neuville . Louis-David glanced about him apprehensively . Would some hawk-eyed revolutionary notice that one less was leaving Varennes than had come ? But nothing seemed to happen . The crowd , satisfied with its victory and the spectacle of the King and Queen climbing back into the berlin and ostensibly resigned to returning to Paris , was in a happier frame of mind . The shouts of " Vive le roil " were magnified and when Bayon and Romeuf , climbing into their saddles , displayed themselves as the leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " shook all the windows in the Rue de la Basse-Cour . No , the fact that one courier was missing had not been remarked at all . After all , if he kept out of the way of Sauce and the group of municipals who must have noticed him in the now deserted room above the candle-festooned joists he had little to worry about for the moment . Varennes was obviously crammed with strangers and one more among so many , particularly one without a coat , would hardly be noticed . There were dozens of men in the crowd without coats on this warm day . His troubles would begin when he started on his journey toward Montmedy . He would have to procure a horse and he would be compelled , for safety 's sake , to travel by back roads , and , whenever possible , through woodland . But these potential dangers he faced with a fair degree of equanimity . The immediate problem was to conquer his exhaustion and he decided that as soon as he was clear of the town , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he would find some secluded spot and sleep there through the sultry hours of the day . He was not going to think about anything but the safe completion of the commission the Queen had given him . Her ring , the ring that was to be delivered to Fersen , felt hard in his pocket and as his fingers closed about it he tightened his lips with determination . There was a squalling of released brakes , additional cries from the populace , a groaning and a rumbling , and the huge berlin that had set out from Paris so short a time before started into movement . The postilions plied their whips vigorously as the six horses dragged the unwieldy bulk high-piled with luggage back up the hill that it had descended the night before . Louis-David felt that something left his breast with the departure of the coach and as he watched it disappear tinder the archway of the ancient church , whose bell was still ringing , something rose in his throat and he swallowed thrice with difficulty . The crowd streamed along after the unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Then , glancing up at the opaque window of the room above Sauce 's grocery shop , he drew a deep sighing breath and turned to face the bridge that crossed the river Aire . All the bells in Varennes were chiming as he walked down the steep street .   FROM WHERE David stood on the tree-shaded Champs-Elysees near the road leading to the Barriere de Monceau he could see three of the crudely-printed placards that had been hastily pasted up all over Paris the night before . The black letters winked in the late sunlight . Quiconque applaudira le roi sera battu ; quiconque l'insultera sera pencils . Whoever applauds the King will be beaten ; whoever insults him will be hanged . The American wondered if this warning had been necessary to hold in check the emotion of the vast concourse that was all about him , a frightening sea of eyes that peered over the slanted muskets of the thick hedge of National Guards lining the way . He had said as much to Mr. Paine , who was standing beside him , but Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Paine 's face was very grave and whenever he spoke he seemed to be reassuring himself as much as David . There was something in the atmosphere of the day that displeased and frightened him . " What folly ! What folly ! " he had exclaimed once in answer to no question from his companion . " Are they not aware that the absence of the King is more desirable than his presence ? " And again : " I am sorry that the King is recalled . It would have been better for the nation to have shut the door behind his flying heels . " And even now as an electrical current of suppressed movement swept through the thousands of crowded spectators , an impalpable announcement , as it were , of the imminent appearance of the King , he grasped David firmly by the arm and said in a chagrined voice : " You see the absurdity of monarchical government ; here will be a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one man . " The berlin , preceded by a clattering body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Champs-Elysees toward the Tuileries . David leaned forward , his eyes intent on the bilge vehicle . There was little to see and what he did see did not include that face for which he searched . There were two gloomylookingofficers in the dusty livery of some noble house on the box with the coachman and from the near window of the berlin a grim young face gazed out . After a moment 's study the young man recognized this face as belonging to Barnave , the deputy he had met in the Breton Club two years ago . A light carriage and a second body of horsemen trotted behind the berlin . That was all . The well-known features of Louis-David Couetus , for whom David searched , were nowhere to be seen . Within a minute the short procession had passed . Mr. Paine turned , still clutching David 's arm . " That man is no longer Louis Sixteenth , " he said , nodding his head in the direction of the vanishing berlin . " He is merely Louis Capet . " There was no triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American gazed at the hushed multitude , which was now breaking up into shoving units , and a desolate feeling of foreboding flowed along his nerves like an icy stream . He felt cold . Perhaps it was the twilight falling , for it was after six and the sun was no longer to be seen in the heavens . " There is no danger to him , " he said , half to himself . Mr. Paine caught angrily at the word . " Danger ! " he exclaimed . " Have you no faith in humanity ? France will not stoop to degrade herself by a spirit of revenge against a wretch who has dishonoured himself . In defending a just and glorious cause , it is not possible to degrade it , and the universal tranquillity which prevails is an undeniable proof that a free people know how to respect themselves . " The vigour of his words was diminished by the frown of concern on his forehead . He was not sure . " This silence is not tranquillity , " replied David morbidly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could feel in the air a heaviness that was like the atmosphere before a terrible storm . " No , " he said again , not wholly aware of what he was saying , " I have no faith in humanity . " He did not know in what direction he was walking with Mr. Paine nor did he care . There was no particular place that he desired to go and the one place that he should have gone he shunned because he had no news to bring . He knew that Anne-Marie was waiting in the house on the Rue des Perles for him to cone and tell her that he had seen her father . He had not seen her father . He had seen a perturbed-faced coachman , three indifferent postilions , two dust-covered men in livery , four mounted officers , two squads of cavalry , a light carriage , and the grim young face of M. Barnave . P307That was all . And he had felt a silence that was oppressive with a withheld threat . He had not seen Louis-David . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which Anne-Marie faced the frightening days . It was impossible for him to go back to her with the renewed emptiness of doubt . Mr. Paine was pushing him through the crowd , thrusting him against surly men who thrust him back again . It was just like those days before the Bastille fell but now his waking trance was one of concerned obsession for a tall muscular man with grey temples at whose table he had sat numberless times . Louis-David . What , in the name of God , had happened to him ? Mr. Paine was going to the Philadelphia House . As well there as anywhere . He was sure that Anne-Marie would not be able to sleep all night . It was even possible . . . With a horrified gesture he stopped still in his tracks and caught Mr. Paine by the lapel of his coat . " There has been no news of any . . . accidents , " he said in a hoarse voice . " No one was . . . " " It was quite peaceful , I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . " The King delivered himself quite readily at Varennes . Why do you . . . " Mr. Paine went on talking . They were pushing their way through the great space before the Tuileries . Yes , there was a storm coming up . The Philadelphia House . . . " I think I shall leave Paris , " he said , breaking in on Mr. Paine 's speech . " The heat is making me stupid . " After all , there was nothing chaining him to the city . He was weary of dancing attendance on Mr. Morris and affecting an ease lie did not feel in the artificially smart salons . It was all very well to observe these fantastic and unreal figures against the tenebrous background of the day when one was lightly disposed and detached but he was no longer so indifferent and removed from the painful divagations of Paris . He was implicated in them through his concern for Louis-David , for Anne-Marie and for Alain . He who knew so little of life was being drawn by his insubordinate affectionsinto the whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientate himself . There was the glaring case of Alain , Alain whom he loved and with whom he lived , to impress upon him the faltering nature of his own understanding . Matters had now drifted to such a pass between him and Alain that there was an actualp308embarrassment in their meetings , a forced composure that was not a composure at all , a strained watchfulness and superficial intercourse that was horribly like treading a dry volcanic crust that might break at any moment . He was exhausted with these wary encounters where the forcedly-assumed companionship was hollow and thin , where the words that once had been so spontaneous were now surchargedwith implications almost desperate of a casualness that existedno longer . If there had been any lingering doubts about a change in Alain ( and how intensively he had clung to those doubts ! ) they had ceased to exist . They had vanished since the day LouisDaviddisappeared when an Alain of angry silence and agitated movementsappeared in the Rue Vivienne for a few minutes and then departed for two whole clays and nights , an Alain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knitted brows that brought to his startled companion a perplexing memory of a face once seen . It had not taken the American long to run that face to earth . Indeed , it had flashed upon him suddenly as he sat in the twilight of the chamber in the Rue Vivienne and stared forlornlyat the prints that Anne-Marie had given him . In that unreal silence the face had resolved itself murkily in the misty air , a face with drawn black brows and an indignant determined expression and for the first time he had known that Alain resembled his brother , Yves . It was as though some likeness that had lain concealed beneath the skin had mysteriously erupted , breaking forth and spreading like a foul disease . He had not believed it at first but the face hung there , bodiless and scowling , like a supernatural testimony . He had been frightened . He had felt the rapport between him and Alain dissolvinglike strands of sand . And then he had jumped to his feet with a cry of pain and regret . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for him to see Alain again and he knew in the depths of his heart that he must see him if he was to retain any faith in the goodness of life . It was not enough mutely to assert that men did not harbour werewolves within their flesh . One must make the attempt to exorcise the beast . But how to go about it ? Surmises and conjectures were feeble weapons . Perhaps it would be best to get away for a time , to medicine himself with distance and make certain that his own brooding imagination ( a faculty that he had scornfully denigrated in the past ) was not playing tricks with his reason . He shuddered when Mr. Paine impatiently tugged at his arm . No , he would not go to the Philadelphia House . And suddenly he was striding along by himself through the Rue Saint-Honore.  |p309The  black river of people flowed all about him , not silent now but subdued in demeanour . He was drifting along with them , purposeless , unaware of where he was going but dimly conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was devastating was creeping through his soul , a misery of loneliness that was akin to a heart-breaking sensation of loss , a loneliness as desperate as that of the lost monarch he had just seen in the great berlin . With it came increasing shudders of fright , the fright of a man existing in a desert among mirages and knowing them for mirages . All the stabilities were crumbling into impalpable mists about him . Alain . . . Alain . . . Anne-Marie . . . Two days later , on the advice of Mr. Morris , he was gloomily settling himself in an auberge in Fontainebleau directly opposite to the deserted chateau . He would pass the summer there and attempt to establish an acquaintanceship with himself . . . if that was possible . Alain did not actually feel David 's departure until a full week after the young man had disappeared . Two strenuous struggles which ran parallel with each other absorbed all his energies . One was outside of himself , although he felt that his entire will was dedicated to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his emotions . Through both of these struggles he existed without any reasonable volition of the mind . He was no more than a puppet in the grasp of demonic passions that twisted him , in spite of his feeble remonstrances , as they would . There were moments when these two passions appeared to merge into an overwhelming unity of being and then they separated again and became distinct and apart . If one was the stronger it was that concerned with Anne-Marie , for it often enough coloured the other which was no less than the republicanardour that had been instilled into his receptive mind by Danton . Hurled to and fro , as he was , by these passions it was not strange that he should fail to miss the presence of David . And when it did suddenly occur to him ( one evening in the eerie stillness of the chambers in the Rue Vivienne ) his momentary chagrin and bewildermentwere speedily devoured by the two daemons who walked ever beside him . Since the return of the King all Paris had been split into two antagonistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lameths , and strengthened by the momentarily-unified Constitutional Royalists , P310desired to re-establish the upset throne that had crashed from its dais when Fersen 's berlin had set out for Varennes ; the other , dominated by the voices of three terrible men , Robespierre , Danton and Jean-Paul Marat , were equally determined on deposing the King . It was into the midst of this clamorous battle that Alain was dragged by Danton . The seething pot was on the verge of boiling over and the unleashed passions of the populace had passed from frantic argumentationto a sort of politico-religious hysteria . Men could no longer maintain their tempers when they disputed . Jacobins , Cordeliers , Palais-Royal orators , pamphleteers , journalists , Republicans , disaffected soldiery , the unwashed hordes of the Faubourgs , all saw at last the supreme chance to abolish the King and they made the most of it , flooding Paris with placards and pamphlets , screaming , shouting from the bornes , demonstrating , parading , petitioning the National Assembly and instigating undisciplined meetings . The Constitutionalists shrank from the abyss they saw opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alain was a Cordeliers man . His implicit faith in the judgment of Danton , a faith that was the natural consequence of his wholeheartedhero worship , had carried him to such an extreme of dependencythat he no longer observed the phenomena of Paris with his own eyes . He saw what Danton desired him to see . But he felt the hysterical frissonnerent that shook the city like a feverish disease , for that was something that needed no explanation . It was like a contagion spreading with indescribable speed from boulevard to street and from street to alley . It was a new plague and Alain , already weakened and lost in the vortex of the times , was bitten by it . The Ironic Spirit , if such a civilized deity existed , looked down , then , on a young man of malleable temperament who had been completely torn free from any moorings of perspicacity or detached consideration , a young man rushing with ten thousand other young men before the obstreperous hurricanes of the era , a young man , like all those others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fanatical leaders . In every man there is a wolf , be it werewolf or not . And at certain moments in history when  --  through some monstrous phenomenon  --  thechain of civilization breaks this wolf is set free and he runs with other wolves , simultaneously released , in howling pack . It is these wolves who devour reason , tear down the fabric of government , swing ropes from lamp-posts , raise barricades , fling incendiarytorches , and wield dripping swords and pikes . The wolf once freed is subdued only by a powerful master with a terrible whip . But in the absence of this master and while the enunciators of wolf/philosophy  --  which in itself is the negation of all philosophy  --  continue to break the chains that bound the wolves they run only in headlong flight of anger destroying and desecrating all that kept them in check and pausing only to devour each other . Alain was well on the way to becoming a wolf . He sat at the councils of Danton , accepted without hesitation the inflammatory concoctions of Camille Desmoulins and Marat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demandingthe deposition of the King which was to be signed on the altar of Federation in the Champ-de-Mars . And when the Assembly , on July fifteenth , passed the decree establishing the inviolability of the King and so reseated that bewildered lump of flesh on the throne of St. Louis he was with the thousands of others who roamed the streets that night and threatened riot and heaped curses on the heads of Barnave and Lameth and their associates . But , luckily for him , he was not on the Champ-de-Mars on the seventeenth when the hot and indignant National Guard , tired of having brickbats flung at them , fired on the demonstrating mob and killed a score or so of potential wolves . He was sleeping , for he had been up all the night before at a meeting of the newly-formed Cordeliers Club on the Rue de 1'Ecole-de-Medecine . There , a great meeting , which had included Danton , Desmoulins , Marat , Freron , Chaumette , Hebert , Legendre , Robert , Momoro , Anacharsis Clootz , Vincent and the Spaniard , Guzman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the club . Liberte , Egalite , Fraternite . What a phrase ! Ile had shouted with the loudest of them . He did not know that the frenetic enthusiasm that animated himas not wholly due to the inspiration of Danton and the whirling ysteria wherein he had been caught up as a young tree is caught Up in a cyclone . It was impossible for him to understand that his passion for Anne-Marie ( that emotion which had blazed forth like a sudden fire in his heart ) was part and parcel of his nerve-strained ardour . It was an unconscious but sure instinct that plunged him into the revolutionary excitements and so released him momentarily from the tempestuous obsession of Anne-Marie . While he wasdrowned in the thunders of discussion in the Cordeliers Club , beaten by Danton 's voice and stabbed by Desmoulins 's stuttered phrases , he could not hear the clear accents of Anne-Marie and while his nostrils were clogged with the acrid smoke of revolutionary pipes he could not smell the subtle odour of her body that was so like spring water and shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was unaware that an instinctive need for such releases flung him feverishly into the political demonstrations he was assuredly not unaware that he was painfully haunted by Anne-Marie . It was marvellously strange and frightening that she who had been an integral part of all his early years should so suddenly be transformed into a beautiful and implacabledaemon dragging the sleep from his eyes and destroying all his calm . He could not explain it and neither did it occur to him to attempt to explain it . The fact was there and it enveloped everything else . He knew that he loved her with a fierce hungry passion that was more like an uncurable ailment of the body than an emotion of the heart . He knew , too , that this love , born so abruptly in the flash of a minute , had nothing in common with that ancient adoration that had placed her apart in the secret temple of his youth 's worship . No , it was a love that was all of the earth , breath-taking , rubycoloured , venereal . It had come upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a hot wave of excitement while the flesh of his body quivered and his pulses beat like a hundred little drums . There were moments when it was an exquisite torture and a secret shame and there were other times when it was a supreme triumph that he desired to tell all the world . Yet he never came to the point of telling anybody . Danton , with his gustiness and forthrightness , his love of food and women , of wine and struggle , might have advised him in a manner that , as yet , he did not feel himself strong enough to accept . When all would dare should one abstain ? But after the rioting of July seventeenth on the Champ-de-Mars Danton ( reasonable even in his valour ) fled from Paris and buried himself somewhere in the country . Alain was forced to make shift without his leader . And the only other person in whom he could have confided or asked for reassurance was David and David was leading a hermit 's life in Fontainebleau . But even if David had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festering passion ? He did not actually ask himself this question but a curious embarrassment came over his mind when he thought of David . The American , whom he still loved more than any man living and that included Danton  --  one did not love Danton ; one adored him  --  seemed to be steadily receding as though he was being sucked back into . . . yes , that was it . . . back into the frame . But he had never left the frame . Perhaps , then , it was the frame that was receding , that was fading into a world that had already faded . There was a third person to whom this passion might be revealed . There were even brief flitting fiery moments when he endeavouredto picture himself blurting out everything to Anne-Marie herself buthis imagination refused to limn her face as she slowly turned itp313toward his avowal . He could see the white neck and the crown of dark red hair but the features were a revolving mist of impenetrableshadows . Or a blank whiteness that was more terrifying than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay of Louis-David 's departure when his rising passion had choked him into a trembling frenzy of incoherence . Each time the throttled feeling possessed him and he had fled , there was no other word for it , from her presence , seeking the wind-blown quays where he could draw in long breaths of air and force back the passion that well-nigh overmastered int . There were even nights when he had walked up and clown.fore the house on the Rue des Perles like a sentinel on guard . The gilts in the windows had blinked out and he had heard Jean-Antoinesting the chains on the gate to the courtyard . Then he had bowed 's head into the summer night and walked swiftly to the left bank f the Seine where the builders of a new world sat about the winestainedtables and smoked their pipes . Ile was torn between two masters . And he could not name either one of them . Tomorrow . . . In spite of the lusty summer weather the house in the Rue des cries was a cold , bleak and disheartening place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to a life without r father . His absence changed the aspect of everything . The y rooms seemed strange without the firm echo of his tread and hen she sat at table with the Marquis de Meyracq , who had succumbed to a pettish hypochondria , she was constantly assailed by uneasy expectancy . She was ever listening for the sound of opening door and the rapid tread of well-known footsteps . Thest weeks had been the hardest for her , weeks when each day might ve brought news of Louis-David or the man himself . She had n certain that the humiliating return of the King would restorefather to her . It had not . It had not even brought any news him . It had left him in that awful void of mystery that stretched yond Varennes . She could not tell whether he was languishing in le prison or had fled across the frontier . During these days , whilestate of mind was an irritable sickness of frustration , she movedbut the cold , bleak and disheartening house like a lost soul , envouringwith poor success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . It was not until mid-July that relief came to her in the form of a tied note from her father . He was safe in England , in London , a cryptic phrase conveyed the information to her that various undertakings ( which he did not specify ) might keep him there for some time . He begged her to be serene and cheerful and to attend , as all of them must attend , happier days . That evening the Marquis de Meyracq , for the first time in many weeks , heard the gentle music of the clavecin . Anne-Marie was restored to mental health . There were still matters that troubled her mind , however . She was certain , knowing her father as she did , that he was embarked upon some perilous enterprise , some matter , without a doubt , that concerned the fortunes of the King . This frightened her for she could not avoid the manifest enmity of the enrages of Paris toward the throne or the sulphurous threats against Royalists that appeared with increasing frequency in the mushroom journals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hid from the authorities in the dark corners of the city but never failed to issue his scurrilous journal . She did not want her father to mingle in these matters . She did not want to remain in Paris . There were even times when she did not want to stay in France . Above all things , she desired her old world , that world that had been circumscribed by the Loire and the forest to the north of it , that world where she had played as a child and never been vexed by the interminable rumbles of drastic change . It was difficult for her to realize that such a gracious world no longer existed , that the Chateau de Tressillac was a heap of cold embers and that she was rapidly becoming an anachronism . Everything was changed . Even David . The fact that he had left the city without bidding her farewell had not troubled her during the first few weeks when her anxiety over her father 's fate had closed her mind to all other things , but now as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emotion of mingled disappointment and chagrin possessed her whenever she thought of him . Had she meant so little to David that he could vanish so swiftly and without a word of friendship ? She had become accustomed to David as she was accustomed to her father and it startled her slightly to realize that the young man 's departure had left an actual gap in her life . For whom would she play the clavecin now ? It was small comfort to regale the marquis with the airs of Gluck and Gretry for since his sour humour had settled upon him he no longer took any pleasure in music . It reminded him , he said , of better times and such remembrance increased his gloominess . He preferred to sit in a corner of the salon and mutely curse the memory of Jean-Jacques Rousseau . If only David would come back . . . Loneliness was a sad companion . There was , of course , Alain . She thought not at all of him during the unhappy July days whenP315she was immersed in chaotic suppositions concerning her father but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happeningwith perceptive eyes she realized with intense surprise that Alain , too , had changed . Was the world going entirely mad ? Had some monstrous virus spread through its helpless bulk ? At first , she could ascribe no other reason for the half-choked moody demeanourof Alain when he visited her than that of the sick times . I Ic had never spoken to her of any revolutionary ardours that might he blazing in his bosom but she had suspected them for months . He had been too careful not to be drawn into arguments with her father or the marquis and his long absences had wrought a perceptible change even in the expressions of his face . She recalled quite clearly that evening in the autumn of the year before ( and how far away that seemed now ) when he had appeared after a long absence and she had been quite fascinated in observing his strange demeanour . It was not that he had said anything ( he had n't ) , but her sharp intuitionwhere he was concerned convinced her that something or someone had wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guess but it had removed him from the rest of them in some indefinable way . She remembered that evening quite well for she had intended to play for David and then she had n't . Something had stopped her . Some alien influence in the room . Why , it might even have been . . . But if Alain 's opinions on the burning topics of the clay had changed ( and at this inference she nearly smiled , for Alain had never had any opinions ) , what had that to do with her and why should it transform the young man into a tongue-tied awkward creature with nervous and incomprehensible reactions ? For that was how heseemed to her now when he made his hurried visits and often enoughabruptly departed in the very midst of a speech . Because she wasgenuinely fond of him and because he represented so much of thatst that now was her regret she took some pains to solve thisproblem of his curious behaviour . To her he was still a boy and w attempted to judge him as a boy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and even wept with her ) but eitherr judgment was at fault or she was incapable of pursuing herasoning to its proper conclusion , for she arrived at no satisfactorylution whatsoever . A dozen and one tentative conjectures wereignantly rejected by her intuition . The knowledge came to her in a blinding flash one day late in August . Alain had been more uneasy than usual and when after a stutteringattempt to answer several of her questions he had unexpectedly risengo he had seized her proffered hand , a thing he had never done before , and violently kissed it , pressing his dry hot lips against it until the actual pain had caused her to withdraw it and start away from him with a stifled cry of surprise and injury . He had straightenedup and stared in confused and naked surrender of himself into her wide eyes . It seemed to her afterward that she must have visibly shrivelled in that betraying passionate blazing stare . Then with a half-sob of regret and desperation he had run from the room . She could hear his feet beating across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean-Antoine and order him to refuse Alain entrance to the house if he came again but it died away , beaten down like a small flame in the shocked flood of her realization , before she could reach the bell rope . It was impossible , impossible , impossible . She repeated the word to herself knowing all the time that it was possible and that it was true . Never in her wildest fancies , she insisted to herself , had such an eventuality of their long comradeship ever entered her mind . And now that long comradeship was ended . After the first stunning realization of the situation , a realization that had much of indignation in it , a sorrowful regret possessed her . It appeared to her that all those men upon whom she depended and without whom she was so alone ( for she had attached to herself no intimate friends in Paris ) had placed barriers between themselves and her . Her father had thrust between them the barrier of distance and a Cause . David had deliberately estranged himself by departing from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayal of this monstrous passion . She could think of it as no less than monstrous , as a sort of spiritual incest , for had they not been spiritually brother and sister ? There was no doubt in her mind now about that terrible virus that was creeping through the world and changing everything . The worst of it was that there was nobody to whom she could turn for that sanity of being that was so much her need . The marquis , aging perilously every day and looking more and more like a little lethargic skeleton , existed in a continual testiness of his own . Francoise , the red-checked Bretonne who had come all the way from Tressillac with them during the hurried flight of a year and a half before , was settled in her snug little laundry on the Rue Sainte-Marguerite on the left bank of the Seine . She was literally alone . During the latter part of August and the first weeks of September she never left the house on the Rue des Perles , passing her time in reading the countless journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite the marquis . Alainp317slid not appear again but her thoughts were often enough concerned with him and the startling aspects of his self-betrayal , a discovery that never ceased to maze and confound her faculties of reasoning . 1 t was still impossible to her and it still was true . On September fourteenth the King accepted the new Constitution and with this acceptance the long labours of the National Assembly came to a close . That body of men who had sworn an oath in the Tennis Court at Versailles on June 20 , 1789 , having fulfilled its oath , prepared to separate to the four corners of France for it had been decreed that none of them could serve in the new Legislative Assembly . The news was additional fuel to the continual rage of the Marquis de Meyracq and he stamped up to his chamber where he could snarl at the foggy pressing faces of the future in peace . Anne-Marie sat alone in the salon . The new Constitution meant nothing to her . She was overwhelmed with her loneliness . She heard Jean-Antoine speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door but this did not arouse her curiosity . It did not matter who it was . Not until footsteps sounded on the floor behind her did she rouse herself from her apathetic reverie sufficiently to rise wearily to her feet . She turned her head with a tired movement and looked into David 's face . For a spellbound moment of surprise and disbelief she studied the rave hazel eyes , the bold nose and the deeply-cleft chin . Then , to is excessive embarrassment and her own helpless horror , she burst to uncontrollable tears that she knew were the tears of relief . " Oh , David , " she cried in a muffled voice . " Stay for dinner and will play for you all night ! "   THE FAINT breeze of the early October evening was like a thousand little hands inexorably pushing him toward the house in the Rue des Perles . There were moments when he had the sensation of physically leaning back against this insuperable urge like a man blown along in a gale and despairingly resisting it and yet beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a chaos of his mind he was aware that no power of his will nor remonstrances of reason could keep him away from Anne-Marie . He did not desire it and yet he did desire it ; his heart was set against it and his heart clamoured for it ; his feet were reluctantand still they hurried ; he would escape and he would not escape . He was split in two , desirous and terrified , sane and mad , exalted and overwhelmed . When he had left Danton , newly returned from his hurried flight to Arcis-sur-Aube , he had started instinctively to tramp the distance between the Cour du Commerce and the Rue Vivienne with no thought of visiting the house on the Rue des Perles ; but on the PontNeuf , pausing a moment to regard the shadowy unquiet flow of the Seine , an inexplicable and overpowering urge to declare himself had mastered him completely and he had turned from his accustomed route with such abruptness as to suggest that he had been forcibly directed by a huge invisible hand . All his restlessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage intensitiesof his desire merged into an omnipotent impulse . He had to go to the Rue des Perles . His feet would travel in no other direction . He must speak or die . At the corner of the thoroughfare he did not pause to compose himself as he had paused so many times before . He hurried the faster , almost breathless in his speed . He was pulling the jangling bell at a gate . His feet were crunching across a shallow courtyard . There were stairs to mount . A door opened by itself . Jean-Antoine 's familiar face fled away before him into the vagueness of the corridor . In the open chimney the log-flames rose like jigging gnomes in gold armour to meet him . And Anne-Marie started suddenly to her feet while the small 318P319snuff-box that lay in her lap fell with a sharp little sound upon the ash-grey tiles . " Alain ! " she exclaimed in a voice that shook with a startled concernthat was strange to him . It was her voice that seemed to cleave him apart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so like a man plunging upon death ) Inn no words came forth and then he fell stumblingly to his knees before her , blindly and instinctively flinging his arms tightly about her legs and burying his face in the softness above her knees . He was no longer aware of what he was doing . The tenseness of her scented body strained away from him and her hands thrust back his head with an astonishing strength . " Alain ! " she cried again . " Alain ! In God 's name ! " She was free of him now and hastily retreating toward the fireplace . He remained on his knees , his head forced back and a scowl of pain on his forehead . His jaw trembled when he opened his mouth and he feared that his temples would burst . Then he began to speak and he could hardly hear what he was saying . A dry voiceasped in his ears , " This is impossible to combat ! " and then a iscordant high-pitched flood of words whirled about his head likeflock of invisible birds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swooped , fell dead and rose in buzzing flightthe high ceiling . His face felt like a mask of iron with the grating aw moving inexorably up and down while the tumbling speechfished forth but he was entirely unaware of the purport of hisprotestations . He did not even know whether or not they were prostations . There was no meaning to them . They were like theinful release of a congestion that had been on the verge of bursting . t was with difficulty that he saw Anne-Marie , for her face appearedapproach and recede like the swinging silver censer in a cathedral. ow it was near , so near that he could see the tiny crimson bloods in the corners of her wide eyes , and again it was distant , afeatureless argent mask that trembled in the air . He babbled oncoherently , spreading his arms and stretching then toward her , rusting himself violently forward on his knees while she shrankainst the wall beside the fireplace and gazed with growing frightthe unmanned figure on the floor . It was doubtful that she heard all that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was less speech than a wild released otion in sound , an upheaval that had been suppressed too longnow gushed forth in the incomprehensible shapes of lava . It as meaningless to her as it was to him . But the irrational sense it was obvious and her entire being revolted at the thought of it .   She was instantly obsessed by a single conviction . Alain was mad , stark raving mad . The inhuman times had driven him distracted . He was like those obsessed creatures that she had heard were to be met on the highroads and in the forests and marshes of the Vendee , possessed religiasts , men with maggots in their brains , hag-ridden souls , lycanthropes and vampires , daemon-haunted witches on besoms and warlocks who painted themselves coal-black , people mazed with inexplicable madnesses . A dozen frightful images , the half-forgottenmonsters of old wives ' tales , sprang into her consciousness . Alain was tenanted by an Evil Spirit . Else why was his face so white and covered with perspiration , the strained haunted look so fearful in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible to behold ? She knew nothing of these matters and she was terrified . " Love . . . love . . . without you . . . " She desired to run toward the door but she did not dare move . She had never seen a man like this , a victim of his own mind who had lost all control over himself , and the spectacle froze her limbs . She did not even dare take her eyes from his perspiring writhing face or raise her voice to call across his vocal delirium to Jean-Antoine or the marquis . She felt herself lost and incapable of warding off this terror that threatened her . He was so close to her now , shuffling along on his knees like a monstrous dwarf , the insane and discordant babbling that issued from his twisted mouth rising to a hysterical and imperative urgency that was both frightened command and despairing appeal . He was stretching out his hand to touch her again and this movement aroused her to action . The chains of terror that had made her immobile snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed as he . " Stop ! " she cied shrilly . " Stop ! Jean-Antoine ! My uncle ! " She began to beat furiously at his uplifted face with her clenched fists , her eyes closed and her head turned away from him . There was the clattering of a cane on the stairs in the corridor . She thought she was going to faint and opened her eyes hastily to seek the nearest support . Alain was standing some distance away , a thin scarlet thread of blood running from the corner of his mouth to his chin . Ile was silent , his head thrust slightly forward , a bewildered and hal ( - stunned expression upon his face . The chamber seemed unbelievably quiet and the approaching clatter of the cane appeared to be the only sound in the world.  |p321The  Marquis de Meyracq 's puzzled little face appeared in the doorway . " Did you call , Anne-Marie ? " he inquired in a mild voice . " I thought I heard . . . " She was suddenly as calm and cold as ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called . " Alain turned dazedly toward the door , his hand instinctively lifted to his face . " Alain is going away , " she continued . " He is going away for a very long time . I thought you would like . . . " " He is always going away , " remarked the marquis in a puzzled voice . He turned to the young man . " What new devil 's work . . . " he began . Without a word Alain ran from the salon . They heard his feet beating through the corridor and the heavy slam of the big door to the courtyard . The marquis turned mystified eyes to Anne-Marie . " Is everybody mad ? " he asked querulously . " Now what . . . " " I think it is difficult for him to say good-bye , " she said . To hide the tears that were beginning to fill her eyes she stooped and fumbled about on the ash-grey tiles for the little snuff-box . The street seemed to flow along beneath Alain so unconscious was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he had passed through a great physical exertion that had devoured all his energies and yet there was not the slightest intimation from his body that it was in motion . It was curious . Once he had raced for smiles through the open land along the Loire to be present when his brother descended from the coach that was bringing him from Paris , from the College Louis-le-Grand , back to Tressillac . He had fallen completely spent , his lungs almost bursting for air and his heart beating like a furious drum . But the thought of Yves had brought tin to his feet and he had rushed on . That second lap of his ace against time had been miraculously different . He had seemedbe carried by the wind , to float with incredible speed over the roken ground without consciously touching his foot to earth . The it had poured into his lungs without conscious breathing on hispart . He had not even felt his heart heating in his side . Yet he ad known that he was exhausted and by all the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt like that now . He felt , too , a deadening impulse in his brain , a suspense of the mind that was stilling all passions and regrets . As he walked swiftly toward the Rue Vivienne , unconscious that he was hatlessP322and regardless that a clot of blood stained the corner of his mouth , he experienced together with this freedom from the weariness of physical exertion an equal freedom from the acute mental tortures through which he had been passing for months . He seemed to be entering a trance that put to sleep the innumerable filaments of feelingbut influenced not at all the automatic actions of his body . David solved nothing during his summer 's sojourn in Fontainebleau . I f he had thought that putting thirty-odd leagues between himself and Paris would give him a clearer perspective on Alain he was disappointed . No miraculous flood of light illuminated the tenebrous shadows of that arrested companionship but the lucent shafts of the sun through the overarching branches of the ancient forest did bring a temporary peace . At least , he could stroll along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons of complicated emotions would leap out at him . The forest was silent and in the summer light its trees were motionless . There were no birds to jet their spinning notes through the green foliage . And this was strange . It recalled to him that enchanted wood beyond Tressillac where he had once ridden with Anne-Marie and where he had beheld the secret timeless tower that possessed no door . That tower , recovered in memory , now seemed to him like the heart of life . No one knew what it contained as no one knew what hid within the heart of life . He had paused once before the tower and laid his hand upon its grey invulnerable haunch . He had explored no further . He had been satisfied with a myth . It was so with the heart of life . Inevitably , as he paced the deserted paths , he conjoined this strangely discovered heart of life with the secret chamber that existed inside himself where , a faint whisper of unrest told him , lay caged , chained and gagged tht alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would adjust himself to the myth . The reality was too perilous . So it was with no conclusions but with a calmer mind that he returned to Paris in the early autumn . He rediscovered a city that appeared more stable and optimistic than his limited knowledge had prophesied . The new Constitution and its acceptance by the crown had aroused a great wave of loyalty to the King . Royalist plays  --  Gaston et Bayard , Le Siege de Calais , Henri IV a Paris , La Partie de Chasse a Henri IV  --  drew crowded houses in the theatres and the ancient cries of " Vive le roil " and " Vive la reine ! " were heard again in the public squares . Louis XVI was free to go and come as he pleased although watchful eyes took notice that he did not go tooP323far or return too late . The flight to Varennes was forgotten and forgiven . In the streets they were singingNot ' bon RoiA tout faitEt not ' bonne Reine Qu'elle eut de la peine . En fin les v'laHors d'embarras . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution and the illumination of the Tuileries and the Champs-Elysees was superb . And there was the new Legislative Assembly confidently swearing its solemn oath and superseding the weary National Assembly . Of the seven hundred and fifty men who crowded into Paris to take their places in the Legislative Assembly only one was known by name to David . That was Condorcet . Who on earth , he asked himself , were these others ? Who were Brissot and Vergniaud and Guadet and Gensonne and Carnot and Jaucourt and Ramond and Girardin and Vaublanc and Dumas and Bazire and Chabot and Merlin de Thionville ? He did n't know but he meant to find out . I t was unfortunate for him that Mr. Paine , uneasy bird of passage that he was , had returned to London and was making the rafters of the White Bear , Piccadilly , ring to the rousing but seditious strains of : God save the Rights of Man . Give him a heart to scanBlessings so dear ; Let them be spread around , Wherever Man is found , And with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable as a guide through the virgin forest of the new Assembly . It was natural for David , as soon as he had deposited his meagre luggage in the Rue Vivienne , to hurry to the house in the Rue des Perles . Anne-Marie 's hysterical reception of him amazed and painfullyembarrassed him but he immediately attributed it ( and with some justice ) to her loneliness . With a shocked comprehension he reproached himself for deserting her at the moment when she most needed sympathetic companionship . But , after all , he thought after he had excused himself , there was Alain whom she loved , who , so far as he knew , had been in Paris all summer , and whose duty and privilege it was to sustain her failing spirits with his presence and his affection . Even as he thought this a blurred sensation of uneasiness swept over his assumptions . Could Alain be counted upon for anythingnow ? That was what he would have to find out . He was shocked but not particularly surprised to learn that Louis-David was in England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some hazardous conspiracy . After all , he pointed out , the Revolution was over and the King was safely reseatedon his throne . Everybody in the street said so . What were all the torches flaming for if it was not to announce the auspicious day ? Anne-Marie listened gladly for she was hearing what she desired to hear . And David , observing this encouraging reception of his happy prognostications , assumed with increasing pleasure in the role the status of the wise uncle whose first thought was to relieve the anxieties of his perturbed niece . He dropped naturally into his old habit of frequently visiting the house on the Rue des Perles , dining there two or three times a week , playing chess with the gloomy marquis and even taking upon himself in a certain measure the practical direction of the household . He began to think of himself as a substitute for Louis-David . It surprised him that he saw so little of Alain . Even in the Rue Vivienne the young Frenchman was a brief shadow that hastily crossed the lintel and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontainebleau David had encountered him in the court before their common quarters and while Alain had seemed pleased enough to see him , embracing him spontaneously and then clasping his hand while he inquired about his friend 's health , the American had observed with some concern the pallor , the puzzled pained expression and the restlessness of the man before him . He was like the victim of a devastating obsession . For the first time David began to wonder with some disquietude if Alain were afflicted with a mental sickness . He had heard of hypochondrias , melancholy vapours , nightmare humours and reasonless declines . And if he were so afflicted what could cure him ? What medicines were there for the mind ? These were matters that were foreign to him . He was tempted to discuss the febrile state of Alain with AnneMariebut for some curious reason that he could never quite define to himself the subject was never broached . Time and again he went to the Rue des Perles with this object in mind but some invisible barrier , whether of will or circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman when Alain 's name was on the tip of his tongue . It was almost as though she watched carefully and forestalled him before he could put his thoughts into words . And that , he said to himself , was ridiculous . 1-1e did not even inquire why Alain was never seen in the Rue des Perles . As a matter of fact , he was uncertain whether or not he did appear there for Alain 's peregrinations were wrapped in mystery . Perhaps it was chance that they did not meet in the comfortable salon . He knew that Alain loved Anne-Marie and he never paused to doubt the fact that she loved him . With this self-evident fact as a basis for his conjectures he naturally jumped to the query as to why they did not marry . As soon as the query formulated itself in his mind he seemed to see a streak of light falling across the changed behaviour of Alain . Might it not be possible that the difficulties attendingthat marriage had something to do with the young man 's unpredictable divagations ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the restless times seemed to provide him with no outlet for his energies . He lived precariously upon some little store of money that presumably came from Louis-David . And that money , grudgingly administered by one Ambroise Pic of the Rue de la Harpe , could not last forever . Even in the Rue des Perles the American could not fail to observe an excessive economy that suggested a dwindling purse and no potential reserves . Perhaps , then , that was it . The disturbing factor in this reasoning was his conviction that neither Anne-Marie nor Alain valued money and that , if he knew them as he thought he did , no such difficulty would be recognized by them as a barrier to their common future . After all , there were ways and means of circumventing the cruel negations of misfortune . This couple , for whom his affection was so boundless , had all the world before them . There was even America beckoning in the distance . Why , if the necessity arose , was there not his own modest purse , slim perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had but to call upon Mr. Short , the attache d'affaires of the American Legation and . . . But there . He was quite certain that neither Anne-Marie nor Alain would accept such largess from him . So his streak of light faded out and the change in Alain remainedas inexplicable as ever . He could not find the answer and after long months of wonder he discovered that the sharpness of his perturbation over the widening abyss between him and Alain was becoming dulled . A vague irritation , horn of frustration , aroused him to shoving this unhappiness into the back of his mind . It was always there , however , like a ghostly figure standing in the shadows.  |p326Late  in November Alain suddenly ceased to return to the Rue Vivienne at all . His effects still remained there but he chose to sleep on the left bank of the Seine . He explained nothing to David but merely faded out of the familiar scene and so sporadic had his appearancesbeen in the past that after a few days the American found himself quite adjusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was alone that David experienced that shuddering emotion of being in a room where someone had died . He made it a point to reduce these odd moments to as few as possible . There was always Anne-Marie to occupy his mind and there was Mr. Morris to visit , Mr. Morris who called the members of the new Legislative Assembly " damned bluestockings " and relished quoting Beaumarchais 's Figcaro to the effect that the Republic of Letters was the Republic of Wolves . Mr. Morris was not at all satisfied with the new Constitution nor with the men who administered it . Anne-Marie 's already-disturbed sense of security in life was thoroughlyshaken by the scene with Alain . It seemed to prove to her the instability of the most ancient and accepted friendships and this dreadful realization , strengthened and reinforced , as it was , by the gloomy prophecies of the marquis concerning the future of the throne , aroused in her a despair that was rapidly becoming an obsession . The cold sunless winter settled down on Paris and fed this despair . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , the dwindling health of the peppery marquis and the curious experience of being involved in an indescribable chaos she did not comprehend emphasized this feeling of alienation from all those familiar ways and things upon which her short life had been builded . Not even the presence of David ( and he was an assiduous visitor to the depressed house ) alleviated this sombre state in which she found herself . It was good to see him but she sensed in his inarticulate companionship an invisible barrier beyond which he would not move , an awkward attempt , as it were , to preserve a superficial relationship . There was too much of the pseudo-uncle about him to please her desire for an equal . She was slightly ashamed now of her emotional outburst of greeting when he first came back from Fontainebleau . After all , he was the close intimate of Alain and seeing him as such she suspected the propriety of too complete a confidence in him . She suspected this as much for his own sake as her own for she did not desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alain had created . There was much , then , that she desired to say , P327many moments when she longed to let her self-possession ( so precariouslymaintained ) crash in the presence of an understanding soul  --  but there was no one , absolutely no one , who offered her this release . If only her father were by her side . . . She attempted to rationalize the painful scene she had undergone with Alain but could make nothing reasonable of it . Her first hysterical conviction that he had gone mad remained but what frenzy had touched his mind she could not say . The form of it she knew but she would not accept the first cause . She had known since August that Alain had been devoured by a frantic passion for her and it had aroused consternation , and , later , regret ; but she had never dreamt that it would culminate in so confounding a scene . What unbelievable emotional clash could germinate so diabolical a passion ? When on that summer day he had crushed her hand against his mouth until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as her anger . " Impossible ! Impossible ! Impossible ! " she had repeated to herself , knowing all the time that it was true . These were matters that a woman , no matter how inexperienced , knew without words . Perhaps her mind had stopped at the mere realization , unwilling to proceed further and half-hoping that Time would solve the frightful problem . But Time had done nothing of the sort . The scene in the salon was testimony of Alain 's increasing madness . However she looked at it she could see it as nothing but a madness , a madness that she half-consciously suspected had its origins in the madness of the times . As the Revolution had convulsed France so had it convulsed Alain . Had he not betrayed time and again that he was an ardent Dantonist ? And all Dantonists , to her , were on the road to madness . She was frightened now and an overpowering impulse to get clear of this undesired passion , to flee from it , grew out of her loneliness and fear . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alain was haunting the house in the Rue des Pales . JeanAntoinehad seen him in the early evening loitering along the street and the mystified major-domo had immediately carried the news to her. , At first she had said nothing but when she ventured on her hurried little walk through the surrounding thoroughfares one cold evening and saw Alain for herself , a ghost-faced Alain who had started stumblingly toward her with an appealing hand outstretched , site turned and ran back to her gate with a frightened determination to protect herself . She told Jean-Antoine not to admit Alain into the house at any time . The major-domo , with a quick understanding glance , bowed his head in approval . She never knew whether or not Alain came to the door but a feeling of persecution crept intoP328her mind , colouring her fear and sapping her equanimity . If she was not to walk the streets in freedom , if she was continually to be under the fear of painful scenes , if Alain was to prowl about the Rue des Perles , it was best for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her in this city of unceasing unrest and mounting war-fever ? To travel by herself to England and there join her father was beyond either her powers or her meagre purse . What other place was there where she would be sheltered by a sympathetic friend ? And then she thought of Francoise , Francoise the red-cheeked plump kindly little woman who had travelled all the way from Tressillac with her to Paris after the burning of the chateau . She remembered that Francoise had fallen heir to a modest laundry on the Rue Sainte-Marguerite near the Abbaye . She remembered the tears and protestations of fidelity from Francoise when the goodheartedBretonne had left the Rue des Perles . Why , then , should she not quietly slip away from this sombre dwelling so filled with nostalgic memories of Louis-David and haunted by a demented young man and go to Franeoise ? At least , she would have peace there . She could write to her father and explain that she had left the house on the Rue des Perles for reasons of safety . As for the marquis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would hardly approve of her going away but at the same time she realized that he depended upon her for little . Jean-Antoine fulfilled all his wants and . . . Still , there was a sense of guilt . He was so old , so childlikein various ways , so proud of her . . . And yet , there was her own peace of mind to consider . She could , at least , express the desire to go and observe his reactions . He had left the house in the Rue des Perles only once during the dark winter months and that had been when he went to see his favourite actor , Preville , play in Le Bourreau Bienfaisant at the Comedie-Franeaise . He had stopped for supper afterwards and eaten a great meal of oysters from Colchester , trout from the Rhine and a brace of partridges from the Foret de Senart . Then he had gone to bed for a week with acute indigestion . From his chamber , which he left seldom after his partial recovery , he followed the political happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of journals and hours of gossip . The marquis read and listened and snorted and swore . He gloomily followed the rise of the group of Bordelaise deputies in the Legislative Assembly , those men whom the city called Girondins , and testily pointed out that such scamps as Brissot , Vergniaud , Guadet , Ducos , Gensonne and Isnard regarded themselves as Romans . " Papier-mache consuls , " he grumbled . " They think they are Brutuses , Gracchuses and Catos.  |p329They  nourish themselves on Plutarch and garble the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius . They are only learned rascals . " He insisted that they wanted a war in order to preserve themselves . " They know that the country as a whole is not revolutionary-minded , " he pointed out , " but you can do anything with a people in time of war . " He was momentarily delighted when the King vetoed the decrees of the legislative Assembly against emigre nobles and refractory clerics who refused to take the Civic Oath . But on second thought he shook his head . " They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He in formed Anne-Marie mockingly that he intended to give up wearing breeches and take to the new pantaloons . " As a sans-culotte , " he declared , " I shall resemble the behind of the elephant at Versailles . " It was not until late in February that Anne-Marie summoned up her courage to broach the matter of leaving the Rue des Perles and seeking shelter with Francoise . De Meyracq 's reception of the suggestionsurprised her . He discontinued his testy observations on the motives of " virtuous " Potion , mayor of Paris since November , and regarded her keenly with his bright ferretlike eyes . " If you think the time has come , my dear , " he said slowly . Anne-Marie was surprised that he asked for no reasons . She felt that she must give them and yet an unwillingness to speak of Main stemmed her speech . " I can no longer live in peace here , " she began lamely . " Every- ' hing is changed since my father went away . These walls and empty rooms . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marquis . His gaze dropped to his dinner , a forlorn little haunch of unseasonedrabbit , and his lips tightened . " You need the company of a woman , " he said with some gruffness . ' God bless me , I am no comfort to a frightened girl . " " You are quite sure . . . " she started timidly . He jabbed the two-pronged fork into the morsel of meat . " You will be much better off with Francoise than you are here , " e broke in . " Jean-Antoine calls this damned chunk of rubber rabbit but any idiot can see that it is from an ancient cat ! " She began immediately to make her preparations for departure . It was her first intention to tell David where she was going but upon second thought she decided to do nothing of the sort . It was very probable that he might inadvertently betray her retreat to Alain and her reason revolted against swearing him to secrecy . Suchmove on her part , she was sure , would implicate David in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left out of it . elides , he had disappeared during the whole of the previous summer without telling her where he had gone . She would tell no one , therefore , except the marquis and she would impress upon him the fact that he was to reveal the place of her dwelling to no one . A curious mixture of regret and relief surged up in her mind as the day of her departure drew near . So much had transpired beneath the roof of the house she was leaving and yet when she stopped to consider what these things were she could not enumerate them . The scene with Alain appeared to dominate everything else . It tinged the very atmosphere . Nevertheless , it was in this salon , now so bleak in spite of the bright log fire , that she had renewed her friendly intercourse with David . It was here that she best remembered the tall muscular figure of her father . It was here that she had played the clavecin and listened to the marquis grumble while he outmanceuvred David at chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen upon his knees before her . . . a madman . . . now a ghost that haunted the Rue des Perles . . . constantly her mind returned to that day when all the old familiarity of the room seemed to whirl away into the void where the Chateau de Tressillac reared its phantom walls . She had to go . Yet it was with tears that she bade farewell to her uncle , watched Jean-Antoine hoist her corded box into the carriage and eventually climbed in beside the pleased and fluttering Francoise . When the horse turned the corner of the street and bore toward the left bank of the Seine she was convulsively weeping on the Bretonne 's ample shoulder . Jean-Antoine manifestly desired to close the door . Alain observed this without surprise but with a dull realization that it was so . It was impossible but it was so . The young man heard himself saying something with a muffled voice . " No , M. Alain , " replied the major-domo patiently . " She left no address . She did not inform me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has gone away for a long time . " Was there an antagonistic glint in the servant 's eyes ? " I desire to see the Marquis de Meyracq , " said the young man . It was absurd , this standing on a doorstep he had crossed a hundred times . " The Marquis de Meyracq begs to be excused , " answered JeanAntoineinstantly . " I-le is ill . " Alain raised his head with a puzzled frown just as the door closed . He stood looking at the weather-beaten wood , at the bronze-coped head of the little monk that served for knocker , for a full minute . Then he turned and passed slowly down the shallow steps . In theP331soft sound of that closing door he heard a finality that was absolute . A hand of ice began to close relentlessly about his heart . It was impossible but it was so . Ile walked across the courtyard like a frozen figure , his feet sounding desolately on the uneven cobbles . The Marquis de Meyracq wore an embroidered nightcap that was tied beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested lifelessly on the white sheet . It was like an absurd reduced model in wax . " Even if I knew , my importunate young American friend , " he said in his querulous thin voice , " I would not be at liberty to tell you . Can you not accept my statement that I am quite unaware of her present . . . er . . . quarters ? " " No , " said David in a calm blunt voice . The ghost of a twinkle flickered for an instant in the eyes of the marquis and was then abruptly suppressed . " If I were twenty years younger , " he said gravely , " I 'd have you out for that . Have you no respect for a sick old man ? " " It is inconceivable , " insisted David , " that Mlle. Anne-Marie should disappear incontinently without leaving one word for me . She is quite aware of my perturbation . . . of my solicitude . . . cr . . . our friendship . . . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite understand . Quite . nut , nevertheless , there is the fact . " " You are quite certain that she left no message for me ? " peristedDavid . The little man in the bed growled in his throat like a cat . " The members of my family , " he said precisely , " do not answer questions twice . " " She has not gone to Le Pecq ? " muttered David . " I will play one game of chess with you , " said the marquis . " Where else could she go ? " inquired the American , scowling unconsciouslyat the old man . " Has she received messages from M. Couetus ? " " The chessboard is under the bed , " said the marquis . " It is leaning against the urn . " " You are quite aware , sir , that it is dangerous for an unprotected young woman to travel during these times ? " expostulated David . 7 'M r . Morris says . . . " " The devil take you for a pompous young American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fetch me that chessboard or shall I rise from this cursed bed and lay my cane about your ears ? "   EIGHT WEEKS of mental torture may not drive a man mad but they can castigate his sensibilities into a stupor of complete exhaustion . This was the condition of Alain . He slouched in his chair in the octagonal dining-room of Danton 's apartment on the Cour du Commerce and stared trancedly at the faces that swayed in and out of the glow of the candles . The voices impinged upon his ears and he could understand the words that were being spoken but they aroused no response in him . He was like a somnambulist who could see and hear but whose centre of being was removed from the scene . The faces swayed in and out of the illuminated circle and he observed them without curiosity or any consciousness of observing them . The sallow countenance of Camille Desmoulins . The mean features of Hebert . Danton was leaning back and his head was merged in the shadows . Only his hands , huge , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never done any manual labour , lay limply in the candlelight , two bodiless machines of flesh and blood that relaxed for the moment . His voice , like a primitive force , the prophecy of an earthquake , rumbled out of the obscurity . " The ancient regime committed a great fault , " he said , " that of being prodigal with its purses and so making it possible for penniless students such as myself to be educated gratuitously in the best collegesof the University with the pampered sons of seigneurs . These free draughts of the heady wine of privileged life spoiled us when we returned to the merciless world of affairs . When my studies were finished I had nothing . I existed in misery . I sought vainly an establishment . The bar of Paris was inaccessible . I could not embarkupon a military career without absurd pretention , for I possessed neither birth nor protector . The Church offered me no resource . How could I buy a charge when I did not possess a sou ? My old comrades , those pampered sons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned their backs upon me . The Revolutionp333came ; it was Opportunity ; so I and all those who were like me flung ourselves into it . " " Well , we are here , " cried Desmoulins in his high impeded voice . " We are here , " echoed Hebert . " We are canaille , " said Danton calmly . " We came from the gutter and we fear to be flung back into it . " " We will fill the gutter so high with the bodies of aristocrats that we can walk across it in safety , " declared Desmoulins . " We can govern only through fear , " agreed Danton . It was like a litany . Alain did not move . He was a sleepwalker in the midst of waking mien . He was a sleepwalker to whom April had not brought the spring . He was a sleepwalker from whom the vision of spring , russet hair and grey-green eyes , had fled . He was a sleepwalker who had knocked in vain at a barred door . " By fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the candlelight . " The time has come to unleash that fear . The Constitutioncannot function until the King 's Veto has been abolished . " " Even then it can not function , " stuttered Desmoulins . Was there a gentle creak in the darkness behind them ? " Mealy-mouthed rascals on the one hand and treacherous-hearted dogs on the other , " snarled Hebert . " The Girondins . . . " began Desmoulins . " Roland . . . " broke in Hebert . " Peace , " said Danton in a paternal voice . " They have brought s war and destroyed themselves . When those deputies to the LegistiveAssembly who call themselves Girondins assumed the power doubted for I knew them for theorizers and moderates but now I e that they are reeds to be broken and that the breaking of them ill plunge us forward on the road that we desire to go . When we reak them we break the Constitution and we break the King . We ill have done , then , with compromise . There will be no more vetoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared Desmoulins softly . " There will be Us , " repeated Danton . " There will he the Corliersand the Jacobins and the sections of Paris and there will be more political economists with Janus-heads . There will be Fear . will undertake myself to carry the Terror into the very heart of the rverse court . " " Bravo , Danton , " exclaimed a mocking voice from the shadows the door . There was neither trepidation nor surprise in Danton 's voice as he answered this unexpected interruption.  | " Come into the light , Marat , " he said . " You have stood in the darkness long enough . " Alain , hearing all that had been spoken and yet being touched by none of it , saw the dwarflike figure clad in pantaloons instead of breeches ( that recent affectation called sans-culotte ) glide forward and seat himself at the table . The face of the newcomer , yellow as jaundice and slashed by an enormous mouth , smiled broadly beneath the greasy handkerchief that was knotted about the head . The hands placed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " Good evening , doctor , " said Danton gravely . " Have you come up out of the sewer for air ? " Marat put back his head and whinnied . " I have come to listen to your thunderbolts , Danton , " he replied . " I have been listening for some tine . " " I always hear a door when it opens , " remarked Danton suavely . " Can you hear one when it closes ? " inquired Marat leaning forward . Danton shrugged his shoulders . " Not so clearly as you heard the chained hatches of the prison ship at Woolwich , " he remarked dryly . " What have you come to tell me , Marat ? " " I have come to tell you that war has been declared , " announced Marat . Camille Desmoulins burst into stuttering laughter . " He thinks we are moles , " he said . " I am already aware that the Assembly has declared war on Austria , " explained Danton with exaggerated graciousness . " I was an observer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to march against us . My knowledge even extends to the fact that Charlemagne is dead , that the Bastille has fallen and that you stole the medals and ancient moneys from the museum at Oxford in . . . " " You are well informed , Danton , " broke in Marat insolently . " But I am not speaking of these matters which are known to every beggar in the street . I am speaking of another war . " There was a brief silence about the table while Marat , his head thrust forward like a snake 's , peered into the shadows at the burly rhetor . " Against whom do you wage war , Marat ? " asked Danton presently . " Against whom do you wage war , Danton ? " counter-questioned the other . P335A second silence fell . " Have you an army , Marat ? " inquired Danton at last . A terrible laugh answered him . " Have you generals , Marat ? " persisted Danton . The dwarf leaned forward , the handle of an unseen poniard clacking against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he replied in his mocking voice . " What have I to do with generals ? I have Gonor of the Fourteenth of July and Cuirette-Verrieres the hunchback and Lazowski the Pole and Fournierthe American and Nicolas the sapper and Momoro the pressman and Rotondo the professor . I have the scourings of the Faubourgs and the bandits of Bondy . I . . . " " And yet you hide in the sewers , Marat , for fear of a good heating , " broke in Desmoulins . " Be silent , you stuttering man of words , " replied Marat contemptuously . " I am speaking to your master . " He stretched a hairy hand toward Danton . " Come you out of the shadows , Danton , " he commanded . " You , too , have . . . generals . The Kings of Europe are forming coalitionagainst France . Austria and Prussia are marching . Let us , too , form a coalition . Let us march . " " Against France ? " asked Danton mildly . " Against kings , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And for how long shall we form a coalition ? " he asked softly . " Until you devour me or I devour you , " replied the dwarf . And flinging back his head he burst into whinnying laughter . Danton 's head surged solidly into the candlelight . He stared in turn at Desmoulins , at Hebert , at Alain Gihon . Desmoulins 's lean features were crumpled into a sullen scowl . Hebert was moistening his dry lips with his tongue . Alain 's lifeless and disinterested face , the unreflecting mirror of the sleepwalker , was turned to the candles . It was upon this face that Danton 's glance lingered longest . " Alain , " he said finally . " Alain , my good friend . " " I hear you , " answered the young man . " I hear everything . " " You are tired , " continued Danton . " I shall desire your company early in the morning . Go now to your quarters and rest . " : Hain rose obediently . " What have you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savage changed tone . " We have fenced long enough . I am no light o ' love from Ranelagh . Let us speak in simple words . " As Alain passed out of the room and clown the stairs that led toP336the Cour du Commerce he could hear the rapid accents of Marat in vigorous speech . The frosty feather of the April moon spread an indifferent light over the narrow cul-de-sac . Between the cracks of the shutters opposite issued a yellow ribbon of candle-glow . A half-famished dog cringed hesitatingly from a black doorway and touched his cold nose gingerly to Alain 's leg . The young man did not notice him . He was incapable of reacting to anything . Some mysterious motivating force in his brain had stopped and delivered him to an incomprehensible aphasia . Mr. Morris pursed his lips before he responded . David , sitting dejectedly by the window , could gaze down into the street and see the pedestrians spurting along like black beetles frightened by the sun . It was hard to believe that it was June and even harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared into the seething pot of Paris without leaving a single word behind for him or anybody else . It was so unlike her and yet he could not but recognize the fact that he , too , had vanished in the same way the previous summer . It was not beyond the possibilities that he had established a sort of precedent , a tacit indication that when one was troubled in heart and mind , uncertain of one 's understanding and will and frightened at halfguesseddivagations of time one simply went away without a word . One retired into one 's self in a new environment and essayed to re-establish lost equilibriums . Though what dolorous problem had so tempted Anne-Marie . . . Having pursed his lips long enough Mr. Morris cleared his throat with a loud " harrumph " preparatory to speech . They were all gone now . Louis-David was presumably still in London . Alain no longer came near the Rue Vivienne . AnneMariehad been swallowed up in a single night . It was frightening to observe what was happening to everybody . Who could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Anything that I may say , " remarked Mr. Morris , " is naturally not to be spread abroad . Now that our country has honoured me by this appointment as minister to France . . . " David turned from the window.He had almost forgotten that he had come to congratulate Mr. Morris on his new honour . " You were , of course , the fittest man . . . there was no doubt . " he mumbled . Mr. Morris repressed a gratified smirk .   " It must have broken Mr. Paine 's heart , " he said with heavy humour . Animated by soothed sensibilities , he fixed David with his eye . " The task will be difficult , " he said . " I am quite aware of the lack of consideration entertained for me by the enragt 's . They are convinced . . . but the devil take them . It is a heart-breaking situation . France is on the highroad to despotism . They have made the common mistake that to enjoy liberty it is necessary only to demolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ardent advocates for the Revolution begin now to wish and pray , and even cry out , for the establishment of despotic power as the only means of securing the lives and properties of the people . " " A dictator ? " inquired David . Mr. Morris considered . " It is quite possible , " he admitted . " It is notorious that the great mass of the French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present . order of things than to prevent the return of the ancient oppressions , and , of course , would more readily submit to a pure despotism than to that kind of monarchy whose only limits were found in those noble , legal , and clerical corps by which the people were alternately oppressed and insulted ; and this observation leads naturally to the objects of the combined powers now threatening France with war , which I conceive to be the establishment of a military government on the ruins of that anarchic system ( for it is no more than that ) which now prevails , and in the continuance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , seeing that without a counterpoisein the marine scale , Britain must possess the empire of the ocean ( which in the present commercial state of the world is a kind of universal empire ) , can not but wish to re-establish this kingdom . " Mr. Morris was working up fierily to his discourse and his eyes glistened with the pleasure of dispensing wisdom of a political nature to so submissive a listener . " But a great question occurs , " he declared , raising his voice and t humping his wooden leg to command undiverted attention . " What kind of government shall be established ? The emigres hope for their darling aristocracy ; but it can hardly be supposed that kings will exert themselves to raise abroad what they labour incessantly to destroy at home , and more especially as the French Revolution having been begun by the Nobles , the example will he so much the more striking if they become the victims of it . But if the allied monarchs  --  andI speak of Austria and Prussia , of course  --  have an interestin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more evident interest in preventing a free and well-poised system from being adopted . Such system must inevitably extend itself , and force the neighbouring powers to relax from their tyranny . If the Court of Berlin could have been insensible to this truth , in which it is so deeply interested , the zealous reformers here would not have permitted the Prussian ministers to slumber over their danger . The desire to propagateand make converts to their opinions has led them so far that the quarrel , which might have been only political , has become personal , and I have good reason to believe , notwithstanding the profound secrecy which is preserved respecting the designs of the Grand Alliance , that it is in contemplation to put all power into the hands of the King . Yes , sir , into the hands of Louis Sixteenth himself . Things have been prepared for that event by the inconsiderate partisansof liberty . In their eagerness to abolish ancient institutions , they forgot that a monarchy without intermediate ranks is but anothername for anarchy or despotism . The first , unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such is the horror and apprehensionwhich licentious societies have universally inspired , that there is some reason to believe the great mass of French population would consider even despotism as a blessing , if accompanied with security to person and property such as is experienced under the worst governmentsin Europe . " Another great means of establishing despotism here is to be found in that national bankruptcy which seems to be inevitable . The expense of the last month exceeded the income by about ten millions of our dollars . This expense continues to increase , and the revenue to diminish . The estate of the Clergy is consumed , and the debt is as great as at the opening of the States-General in seventeen-eightynine . The current expense has , by taking away the property of the Church , been increased about a sixth . The dilapidation in every department is unexampled , and they have , to crown all , an increasing paper money  --  that fool 's paradise where they starve Tomorrow in order to feed Today  --  which already amounts to above three hundred millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the most sinister presages . The country-people have hitherto been actuated , in a great measure , by the hopes of gain . The abolition of tithes , of feudal rights and burdensome taxes was so pleasant that a cold examination of consequences would not be admitted , still less an inquiry into the strict measure of justice . Next to the abolition came on those philosophical and mathematical arrangements of the fisc , which are very beautiful and satisfactory , and to which there lies but one objection of any consequence , which is that they are inexecutable . " I have frequently observed that , when men are brought to aban- ( Ion the paths of justice , it is not easy to arrest their progress at any particular point , and therefore , as the whole kingdom ( perhaps I should except Paris ) is interested in the non-payment of taxes , the question will be decided without much difficulty if once the LegislativeAssembly gets out of this city . They must go , David , or they are doomed . Between you and me , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to take the King with them , to which effect a decree has already passed to disband his life-guard , and another to collect twenty thousand men to the northward of the city . An opposition will be made by the Faubourgs and the Paris National Guard to the latter decree , because they begin to perceive the object ; and as it seems to be pretty general opinion among them that no capital opposition will be made to the Austrian and Prussian troops , they consider the person of Louis Sixteenth as forming the most solid alliance they have , to protect them from plunder and outrage . This decree may therefore occasion either a schism between the National Guard and the Assembly , or among the inhabitants of Paris , or both . Already there exists a serious breach between the members of the present administration , and part of them must go out . I have the best reason to believe that the whole will be changed before many weeks , and some of them within a few days . " After this lengthy exposition Mr. Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are well-informed , sir , " said the young man . " But what particularly interests me is your intimation of the possibility of a dictator . Whom , sir , have you in mind ? Danton ? " " Danton ? Peugh ! " snorted Mr. Morris . " He resides on the wrong side of the river . His head and his boots are too big . " " The journalist , Marat , then , " suggested David . Mr. Morris laughed outright . " I hardly imagine they will have to fish in the sewer , " he replied . " Well , who , then ? " persisted the young man . Before answering Mr. Morris withdrew a large handkerchief from the bosom of his waistcoat and stormily blew his nose . " Have you heard this man Robespierre speak ? " he inquired in a meaning voice . " No , " replied David , " I have never seen him . But he is no longer in the government . He holds forth at the Jacobin Club . " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , I think , is the man of the hour . I was certain that Talleyrand would succeed to Mirabeau but it appears that I am mistaken . It is Robespierre who has come to the front , Robespierre whom the Jacobins adore and whom Brissot fears . Now the Jacobins are unlike the other clubs .   The Cordiers is a local affair and the Girondins are a clique . The Jacobins , on the contrary , spawn all over France like a spreading disease . Whosoever dominates them dominates the country , at least that part of the country that is frankly republican . Robespierre is your man there , sir . I think he first impressed me last September when the National Assembly broke up . Those self-abolished deputies left the Manege for the last time through a crowd that was silent . But when Robespierre appeared , on the arm of Petion , he was receivedwith acclamations , crowns of oak leaves were proffered him . and thousands of voices cried Vive Robespierre ! Vive l'Incorruptible ! ' A man so denominated is worthy of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jacobin Club last month have not weakened his astounding hold on the people . If France comes to the deplorable status of a dictatorship it is Robespierre I fear . I fear him , sir . I fear that man . " " But what qualities . . . " began David . " The quality of mystery , " broke in Mr. Morris , " and the title of The Incorruptible . " He observed David with important seriousness . " I am not a prophet , " he said slowly , " but I am willing to wager that a tempest is on the verge of breaking . The best picture I can give of the French nation is that of cattle before a thunderstorm . If I were you I would keep to shelter while it rages . Do not be reckless , David . " " I am not reckless , " replied the young man . " And do not let Mr. Paine lead you too far , " pursued Mr. Morris . " That man is riding headlong to perdition . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , " said David shortly . " Yes , " agreed Mr. Morris savagely , " and being prosecuted , as he should be , for his subversive and seditious tract . Tell me , sir , why do you not return to America ? " The unexpected question aroused no reasonable answer in David and this made him angry . " Because . . . " he stammered , visibly flushing , " because . . . well , because I feel that there is much here that I have yet to see and . . . and should see . " " Urn , " said Mr. Morris . " Well , will you partake of a dish of tea with me ? That is the way it is expressed in England . " " With pleasure , " answered the young man . " I have many more questions to ask you . " " I can answer them all , " declared Mr. Morris with generous confidence . P341David took Mr. Morris 's advice to heart . He kept to shelter while the storm broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass most of his time in the safe seclusion of his quarters on the Rue Vivienne hut a feeling of lust helplessness that seemed to stem from that moment when Mr. Morris had bluntly asked him why he did not return to America . Why , indeed ? He could not answer the question at all and yet he was aware that some insuperable compulsion was keeping him in Paris , a compulsion that was not adumbrated in the stormy scenes that beset the city during this hot summer of 1792 or was implicit in the figures that moved through his mind . Being so unaware of the reasons that kept him where he was he lost most of his desire to parade the streets and observe what was happening . He plunged into barren speculations , instead , and even went so far as to start a sort of journal of his thoughts , a painfully-concocted series of inconsequentialities which he soon surrendered to a hasty fire in his open chimneypiece . He had to admit to himself that he was no lean-Jacques Rousseau . He was merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer came near the Rue Vivienne but David was not without news of him . About once a week a lean youth with eyes set very close together appeared and inquired politely if any correspondencewas waiting for Citizen Gihon . There never was any and David wondered at the periodical promptitude of the mysterious youth , who , it appeared , was called Citizen Fleury , but it pleased him for it gave opportunities for inquiries concerning Alain . Citizen Fleury 's answer was always the same . " Citizen Gihon is very well and labouring indefatigably for the country . " David , though puzzled at this new title of " citizen , " was consistently delighted to hear this unvarying declaration . He suspected that Alain sent this youth with such regularity on his needless errand as a testimonial to the old friendship that had once made the apartment in the Rue Vivienne so comforting a place . Alain wants me to know that he is all right , thought David . But was Alain all right ? David had long ago given up any attempt to solve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still possessed by pain and sadness whenever he thought of it . He accused neither Alain nor himself now of any guilt in this broken relationship . He accused the times , instead . And he forced himself to have a desperate faith that Alain would eventually return ( perhaps after the storm had passed ) and that all would he as it had been before . The friendship had not been broken . It had merely been engulfed momentarily in the stormcloudsof the day . Alain had been caught up in a particular whirlwindof his own and both of them would have to wait for calmer weather before the old stability of relationship might be re-established between them . The continued disappearance of Anne-Marie was much more quick in his mind than the cessation of his comradeship with Alain . After all , he had forced himself to a sort of adjustment to the defalcationof the young Frenchman whereas the absence of AnneMariewas something comparatively new and inexplicable . It seemed so unlike her to disappear so abruptly without leaving any message for him . He had ( perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a natural protector of the young woman , a vicarious elder brother or uncle to whom she could turn for advice and safety , and he had been pleased to think that she accepted this role with some degree of satisfaction . At least , it had seemed that way . But now he began to think with increasing helplessness that he was of no value to anybody . It was disconcerting and humiliating to see himself so unnecessary a factor in the lives of those whom he called his friends . All those winter evenings when he had assiduouslyvisited the Rue des Perles , listened to Anne-Marie play on the clavecin and struggled against the marquis at chess seemed to have gone for nothing . He had failed to become a necessity to AnneMarie . She had found it in her heart to disappear without leaving one word behind for him . This was more important to him than the place of her hidden harbourage . He was certain that the Marquis de Meyracq knew where she was and he was equally certain that it was her desire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last conviction that hurt him the most . " But she is safe , " he insisted to himself . " She is safe . . . or de Meyracq would admit as much . " His feeling of helplessness , therefore , was not intensified by a conviction of danger . Yet the unrest of the city , as he heard of it through his infrequent calls upon Mr. Morris , aroused a bewildered anxiety within him . It was from Mr. Morris that he learned of the onslaught on the Tuileries on the twentieth of June ( the anniversary of the famous Oath taken in the Jeu de Paume at Versailles ) when a turbulent mob burst into the royal apartments and furiously demanded the abolition of the King 's Veto and the restoration of the dismissed Roland ministry . Mr. Morris , who had his information from the Baron de Blome , said , " His Majesty put on the bonnet rouge , handed top343him by some unwashed rascal , but refused to be coerced . This is neither the form in which it ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he calmly told the surging crowd of angry people who pressed upon him , almost to the point of suffocation " ; and Mr. Morris added grimly , " The Constitution has this day , I think , given its last groan . " David was horrified to think of a mob breaking into the Tuileries and yet , so far had matters drifted and so unpredictable was the Parisian populace , he could not say he was surprised . Nothing that happened in the city could surprise him now . Mr. Morris was certain that the demonstration of June twentieth was an attempted coup that had narrowly missed success and he looked for a repetition of it . Neither was that dark anticipation surprising to David . He had reached that point of helpless observation where all that happened outside the walls that bounded number fifteen , Rue Vivienne was like a monstrous shadow show or the frenzies of unbelievable painted puppets . These crowds that swirled in the streets , these orators calling from the bornes , these conflicting rumours and clashing predictions , these fiery pamphlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , these oaths and premonitions and cries of dismay and bloodthirstywarnings , this helter-skelter of a disorientated people threatenedby war from without and disaster within and harried by contradictoryleaders was , all of it , like a meaningless storm at sea in which the winds blew every way at once . Mr. Morris had said , " A dictator . " Well , one must wait for him . Danton ? Robespierre ? Marat ? Who could be heard above the drums and general outcry ? It was an unexplainable sort of loneliness that withdrew David from all this turmoil , a loneliness engendered not by the foreign aspects of the scene but , curiously enough , by the lack of someone to share his detachment with him , to be apart , as it were , from what was happening . Three years ago Mr. Paine had walked through the streets with him and he had not been alone . During the summer of 1790 there had been Anne-Marie and Alain and Louis-David . The summer before he had withdrawn from the noisy stage to the quietude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no one ( for the awful cathedral-like pomposity of Mr. Morris did not count ) with whom to share his detachment , his interest and his surprise . It was necessary to fall back completely upon himself and he found himself distinctly lacking . Why did n't he go back to America ? Because he could n't . . . the thought burst bluntly enough through his brooding . . . because he was incapable of removing himself from Paris . . . because he was waiting for something . But what he was waiting for he could not say . Some voice of iron spoke to him and bade him remain in the midst of the discordant scene . " Now , " he said gloomily to himself , " I am waiting for something to happen and I have not the slightest idea of what it is . " He had started his journal again . When one was alone so much there seemed nothing better to do . Now that Mr. Morris had been officially inducted into his duties as representative of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-nosed Americanwith that frequency that had formerly filled so much of David 's time . Mr. Morris was extremely busy waiting on M. Dumouriez , the new minister for war , and inditing long epistles to Mr. Jefferson . And , too , there was that matter of safety . It was wise to keep under shelter while the storm broke and raged . David was not frightened , his very lack of knowledge of what was happening was a bulwark against fear , but he was essentially prudent and he did not fail to observe that his distinctive and alien appearance aroused more than the usual interest in the unending files of armed loiterers who paraded the streets . Even the concierge at number fifteen , Rue Vivienne viewed him with a glum and threatening curiosity . This fellow , a lean rat-faced man who had secured himself a crimson liberty cap as a badge of his patriotism , sat on an empty wine cask before the house and endlessly groaned the new street song that could now be heard in every carrefour . Notts le traiterons , gros Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gros Louis , biribi . David , as he sat near the window scribbling in his journal , could hear him punctuate each line of the verses with a loud hawking expectoration . After the first of August he heard a new song , too , which spread like wildfire through the streets and squares , a song brought to Paris by the clamorous detachment of Marseillais who had marched on foot all the way from the southern city to the banks of the Seine , a Hymne d l'armee du Rhin , which , because it was sung by the revolutionariesp345from the Midi , was speedily called La Marseillaise . It was a rousing effort and it evidently appealed to the musical-minded concierge for he switched from his groaning account of how gros Louis was to be treated to the energetic summons of : Allons , enfants de la patrie , Le jour de gloire est arrive . . It was the concierge who , fastening his ratlike eyes on David , described the arrival of Barbaroux 's motley contingent , " big fellows with the good stink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concierge , too , who brought the news that the section of Mauconseil had proclaimedthat it no longer recognized Louis XVI as King of the French . He had spat three times when he mentioned the monarch . Concierges , it seemed , were an endless grapevine of information , a sort of nervous system to the city along which ran all the vibrations of this hot summer . Also , they were spies . David , although imperfectly aware of all that was transpiring  --  and most of what was transpiring was concealed in a confused secrecy , felt the heaviness of the midsummer weighing down upon him and knew that it was more than scorching weather . The air was as full of presentiment as a storm-cloud is with rain . The faces of the shopkeepers sagged with frightened suspicion ; the squads of National Guards , commanded by Galliot de Mandat since Lafayette had gone to the front to combat the enemy , were surly with trepidationof the unknown ; the cry of " La Patrie est en danger ! " was raised in the streets ; drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combat the Austrians . But it was not alone this fear of invaders that weighed down so heavily theAugust air . There was an inner fear that caused men to glance skance at one another . It was a fear , too , that percolated through le closed doors of the Jacobin Club , the Cordeliers and the lockedambers of the Faubourgs where little groups of men sat aboutcandlelighted tables and spoke in low voices . From his window ' avid could gaze down into the Rue Vivienne where all the backashof the Palais-Royal passed and it seemed to him that theseogle were big with a purpose they alternately dreaded and anticipated . They , too , were weighed down by the **25;4104;TOOLONG atmosphere . This abnormal state of affairs increased David 's loneliness to such a pitch that he no longer desired to walk abroaden for his necessary supplies . He sent the muttering conciergestead and confined himself wholly to his chamber . It was all  --  different from that summer of 1789 when nothing at all could havept him indoors . P346Ile had waked up twice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose groggily from the bed and walked over to the window his ears were assaulted by a grumbling long-drawn-out roar that rose and fell like the sound of a heavy sea heard from a high cliff . There were bells in that monstrous bruit but something else as well , an uneven thudding and crackling that constantly drowned out the hells , an echoing thunder that was like a hundred giants furiously beating an enormous carpet , a carpet that might have stretched half across the heavens . He dressed hastily and ran downstairs . The wine cask stood at the door but there was no concierge upon it . The shops up and down the Rue Vivienne were closed and shuttered . There was not a person in sight on the street . For a moment he glanced about him and then turned and ran upstairs again . Once inside his chamber he closed and locked his door and ran over to the window and pulled the shutters to . His gestures were automatic . It was nauseatingly close in the airless chamber but he did not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolling reverberationsthat forced their way through the closed shutters and shook the stifling atmosphere of the room . He sat down in the fauteuil that Alain had purchased in the Palais-Royal long ago and endeavoured to disentangle the various elements that made up this thunder of sound . The bells were easy for they rose clear and bronzen above the beating wavelike roar . That was the tocsin . And the uneven thudding would be cannon . Somewhere , and not so far away , a concerted and terrific attack on some portion of the city was taking place and he did not have to pause to consider where . The Tuileries , of course . It might be the Manege where the LegislativeAssembly sat but every atom of reason he possessed shouted at him that it was the Tuileries . The coup that had missed fire on the twentieth of June was being repeated and this time it was being reinforced by guns . Mr. Morris was right . The seething pot had boiled over at last . Once he had established in his mind what was happening he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had barely risen to his feet when a wave of gloomy cautiousness swept over him . What would be the use ? He would merely pass through the same tortures that he had passed through on the day that the Bastille had been taken . He sat down again . He would stay where he was until the insanity of the people had spent itself . It would be a test of his own nature to remain calm and aloof from the madness that raged about him . After all , there was no one for whom he cared who could be in danger unless it was Alain . And Alain , he was very sure , would never takeP347part in a bloody insurrection . Why , Alain turned white and faint at the sight of blood . As for Anne-Marie , whether or not she was in the city ( and sooner or later he meant to force the Marquis de Meyracq to reveal her hiding-place ) , she would he sure to conceal herself carefully during this chaos . Yes , he would stay where he was . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore at his nerves and aroused a restlessness that was like a fever . It was impossible to sit still . He jumped up and began to pace about the room . He picked up some outdated newspapers and flung ; them down again . There was no comfort in the Logographe , the Gazette Uniserselleor the Indicateur . He eyed with loathing his open journal on the escritoire . He straightened a print on the wall and poured himself a glass of water from the jug . All the time the grumbling long-drawn-out roar continued , a rising and falling menace that seemed to have the determination of endlessness in its discordant motif . If anything , it increased in volume as the minutes crawled on . The thudding of the cannon grew louder and the scattered waves of musket-fire were more distinct . Presently he sat down and rested his head against the padded back of the fauteuil and closed his eyes . The distant tumult seemed louder when his eyes were closed and he was not looking at anything . It seemed to move closer like an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Rue Vivienne and to shake the closed shutters at the window . He opened his eyes and stared at the shuttersand realized how murky it was in the chamber . He must open them and let the sun in . He had half-risen to his feet when a peremptoryknock sounded at the door . Almost unconsciously and without any premonition of danger he walked over to the locked portal , turned the key and swung the heavy oak back . The concierge 's ratlike countenance thrust into the chamber as though it were on the end of a plunged stick . " He is here alone , " said the concierge turning his head . David was aware of a group of men standing in the hall . " Yes , I am alone , " he said . " What do you want ? What ishappening ? " The concierge was about to speak when a hand covered to the fingers with hair pushed him aside . " Information , " replied a low voice . " We have not come to dispenseit . " David found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty white satin waistcoat . " A little domiciliary visit , Citizen American , " continued the low voice . " We are taking Time , as it were , by the forelock and antici-P348pating the desires of the new government . You are one David Livingston , an American existing without employment in this city . Why are you here , Citizen Livingston , and what are your plans ? It is rumoured that you are the associate of aristocrats . " David was fascinated by the huge mouth from which the words issued and the peculiar headgear of the inquisitor . His limp black hair was bound in a soiled handkerchief and upon this was forced a battered tricorn hat . " You are correct in assuming that I am named David Livingston and that I am an American citizen , " replied the young man . " By what authority do you question me , sir ? " The dwarflike figure waved his hairy hand toward the distant tumult . " That is my authority , citizen , " he said . " I am the Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Republican , citizen ? " David stared with agitated curiosity at the famous journalist . " I am a good American citizen , " he answered . " I am a friend of Thomas Paine . " Marat smiled . " Your answer is oblique but not unsatisfactory , " he said . " Is it true that you associate with aristocrats ? " " I associate with no one , " replied David shortly . " I have no friends in Paris . . . at present . I see Mr. Morris , my minister , from time to time . " Marat continued to smile . " I must tell you , " he said softly , " that the former King has fled to the Assembly and that the patriotic sections of Paris have taken over the government of France . That freedom of speech which was legal yesterday is not recognized today . Do not be short with me , Citizen Livingston . I may call myself an unofficial representative of the sections . Have you any good patriot who can vouch for you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already told you that I am an American citizen . I do not mix in matters that do not concern me . " A scuffling of feet heralded someone coming up the stairs . " Yes , you do need one , " returned Marat . " Every man who can not prove his patriotism , be he Frenchman or foreigner , is suspect from this day . It is the enemy within that I smoke out , citizen . " " Well , I am not an enemy , " answered David , his heart beginning to beat a trifle faster . " I am merely an observer . " " An observer , " repeated Marat with mocking reflection . " One , no doubt , who takes notes ? " P349The scuffling feet reached the top of the stairs and the close-set eyes of Citizen Fleury peered over the dwarf 's back . A feeling of relief surged through David . " Are you acquainted with Alain Gihon , the friend of Danton ? " he asked Marat . " He , I am sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , indeed , share these quarters together . " Marat 's bold eyes half-closed . " Gihon ? Gihon ? " he said thoughtfully . " Ah , yes . The trancelikeyoung man at Danton 's table . But , my clear Citizen Livingston , how am I to know that you are , as you say , close friends ? " Citizen Fleury , who had been gazing alternately from David to Marat as he scratched his nose , now cleared his throat . " I can testify to that , Citizen Marat , " he remarked , " and you know Inc . " The dwarf turned slowly . " You are Desmoulins 's paper-boy , " he said after he inspected the unappetizing youth. " . . . and a Cordeliers , " added Citizen Fleury indignantly . " . . . and a Cordeliers , " repeated Marat gravely . He swung his big head about toward David . " Very well , Citizen Livingston , " he said . " It appears that you are tt patriot . Pray , give my greetings to Citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my advice and remain indoors for the remainder of this day . Good morning , citizen . " " Good morning , " replied David . Marat grasped the rat-faced concierge by the arm . " What other names have you on your list ? " he demanded . " Be lively now . " David walked back to the still-shuttered window leaving the door Open behind him and it was not until he was fumbling with the iron bar that he spoke . " There are no communications for Citizen Gihon , " he said without turning . " Is he well ? Is he out in the streets today ? " " He is at the Cordeliers Club compiling lists , " answered Citizen Fleury who had entered the chamber and stood with his back to the door he had just closed . It was Alain 's message that he was taking no part in the day 's fighting . David pushed the shutters open and the bright sunlight fell in a rushing oblong of light along the floor . " Come . Sit down , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see I have been advised not to walk abroad . " The thudding of cannon appeared to have stopped but the spatter of musketry continued to sound over the rooftops . P350BRIGHT AND early on the morning of August eleventh David was striking the bronze-coped head of the little monk on the closed door of the house in the Rue des Perles . He was both angry and frightened for the disturbed meditations of a sleepless night had convinced him that if the revolutionaries were already instigating domiciliary visits such hotels as the one before which he stood would not fail to be entered . The moment the door opened and he saw Jean-Antoine 's ashen face he knew that both his fear and his anger were justified . The major-domo did not wait for him to speak but caught him by the arm and drew him into the hall . The man 's teeth clacked as he spoke . " God be praised that you are here , M. David ! " exclaimed the servant . " I am fair crazed with fright and bewilderment . They came at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his bed , forced him to half-dress and carried him away with them . When the poor old master protested they struck him across the face and ... " " Gently , Jean-Antoine , " broke in David in choked tones . " Who are they ? Where did they take him ? And why ? " " The officer wore no uniform , " explained the major-domo , " but his bearing was military . I think that he is a representative of the insurrectionary government . There were twelve of them , all armed . The officer read a paper . They have taken the marquis to the prison of La Force . They gave no reasons except that he was what they called a damned aristocrat who was guilty of subversive opinions . Is it true that the King is a prisoner and that Danton rules all ? " David sat down on the chair in the hall . " Give me a minute , " he said . " I desire to think . What did you ask ? Yes , the royal family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is rumoured that a National Convention is to be called . Be silent for a moment . " The servant hovered tremblingly about the young man while he racked his brain in search of some means of aiding the marquis . Two procedures occurred to him but he did not place much faith in either of them . He could go to Mr. Morris , for one thing , but what Mr.P351Morris could do for a Frenchman imprisoned by Frenchmen would surely be little or nothing . Or he could find Alain and insist that the young man approach his great friend Danton in behalf of the marquis . That , too , seemed like a slim chance . He glanced up suddenly at the major-domo . " Jean-Antoine , " he said , " do you know where Mlle. Anne-Marie is ? " The servant shook his head . " Nobody but M. le Marquis knows , " he replied . David uttered an exclamation as he rose to his feet . " I will do all that I can , " he said . " I advise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from M. Couetus ? " Jean-Antoine shook his head again . " I know nothing , " he answered . " I am very frightened , M. David . " " We are all frightened , " returned the young man grimly . He decided to visit Mr. Morris . The streets through which he passed were well-filled with people although all the shops were closed and business seemed at a standstill . The faces of these idlers , he observed , expressed the best of humour and in one square a score or so of Federes , their muskets strapped to their backs , were dancing bourrees and perigourdines to the scraping strains of Basque violins . There were no signs of the fighting of the day before and with deliberate intent to avoid any reminders of it he gave a wide berth to the district immediately adjacentto the Tuileries . The one expression of revolutionary ardour that he saw was half a dozen gamins tearing down a guinguette sign upon which was crudely painted the bearded physiognomy of Henri IV . Mr. Morris was invisible . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was disentangling passport difficultiesat the present moment . It seemed that half the foreigners in Paris desired American passports to facilitate their departure from the city . " This evening , then , " insisted David . The clerk shook his head . Mr. Morris had an appointment with M. de Saint-Pardeau and would undoubtedly be closeted with him until a late hour . " The devil take it , " muttered David . I laving no other place to go he returned to the Rue Vivienne . It seemed to be a rule of politics that whenever it was indispensable to tare one 's minister one 's minister was invisible .   At the door to his quarters the rat-faced concierge , his red liberty cap at a rakish angle , stared insolently at him . " Our good patriots , " declared the concierge in return to David 's stiff nod , " are pulling down the effigy of Louis Fifteenth which stands in the Place before the Tuileries . They are using forty horses . " He spat deliberately into the gutter . " You are abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , perhaps , disturbed for your friends . " " Get out of the way , you . . . you lump ! " exclaimed David in a sudden rage as he shoved the man aside . The concierge 's face mottled into flushed spots of anger . " Ah ! Ah ! " he shouted after the young man . " We have the manners of an aristocrat ! We push honest patriots into the gutter ! We . . . " With some concern David discovered the door to his chambers unlocked . He half-suspected another domiciliary visit from the jackals of the new insurrectionary government . Though why . . . He pushed the oak open and walked in . Alain sat in the large fauteuil facing the door . " Well , heaven be thanked ! " cried David as he hurried forward and extended his hand . " It was my purpose to seek you out today . Have you heard about the Marquis de Meyracq ? " The young Frenchman 's hand was cold and moist and as David held it momentarily in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was thin and colourless and his eyes like those of a half-drugged sick man . " You are ill , " he said swiftly . " What is it , Alain ? " The young man smiled faintly . " I am not ill , " he replied . " I merely find it impossible to sleep any more . I thought I would come . . . home and see . . . and see . . . " His voice died away . " What did you say about the Marquis de Meyracq ? " he inquired . " He has been arrested , " explained David . " Your fine new government has flung the old man into La Force . Though what danger he could be . . . I thought , Alain , that you might approach Danton and . . . " Alain shook his head slowly . " Danton has just taken possession of the Chancellerie , " he said . " He is minister of justice now . He has Robert and Fabre d'Eglantine and Camille Desmoulins with him . He has appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Momoro regional dictators and sent them into the provinces . "  |p353All  the more reason . . . " began David . " He wo n't see me , " broke in Alain . " It will be impossible to approach him for several days . " " But . . . " David was mystified . " Arc you not in his confidence ? You have hinted many times . . . " " Oh , yes , " replied Alain in a colourless voice . " Of course , I am in his confidence . " Suddenly David stepped forward and seizing Alain by the shoulders drew him to his feet . " Look here , " he said . " What is the matter with you ? You are not well . " " I am all right , " insisted the young Frenchman in the same flat voice . David observed him with increasing anxiety . Alain seemed to him like a man whose brain is benumbed . There was a lethargy in his movements and responses that seemed pathological . There was no doubt but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions were sluggish and sometimes nil . He was like a man who had received a shock and had not recovered from it . A sudden idea possessed David . " You were not at the Tuileries yesterday ? " he asked with some perturbation . Alain shook his head . " I was at the club , " he replied simply . " Did you not see Fleury ? " It was not the sight of blood , then . " Fleury ! " exclaimed David , glad of a subject that might interest his friend . Ile began to tell him about Marat 's unexpected visit and the happy intervention of the young man with the close-set eyes . Alain sank back into the fauteuil and appeared to listen while he examined his hands , holding them out before him and slowly turning them , fist palms up and then palms down . The hot morning sun flowed through the open window like a flood of molten gold and from the Rue Vivienne there sounded the quick-step of a body of men marchingin military order . David chattered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his familiar chamber , for the presence of Alain seemed to bring something abnormal and discouraging into the atmosphere . When he had completed his story Alain spoke without lifting his head . " You have not heard from Anne-Marie , " he said . It was not so much a question as a statement . David gave his friend a quick glance .   " No , " he said in a sobered voice . " And no one knows where she is except the marquis . " Alain raised himself sluggishly from the fauteuil . " I am going to lie down , " he announced turning toward his own chamber . " It is good to have you back again , Alain , " exclaimed David impulsively . " Yes , " replied the young Frenchman as he walked toward the inner door . " It is good . " David watched the door close with an actual sensation of apprehension . Mr. Morris could do nothing for the Marquis de Meyracq . " Before God , David , " he exclaimed testily when the young man finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own these days . It would be most impolitic for me to ask favours of any of these rascals . They may all be hanged as high as Haman tomorrow . I have already written to Mr. Washington desiring him to outline a course of conduct for me . No , no , I 'll be damned if I meddle in their internal affairs . The misfortunes of your friend de Meyracq have nothing to do with the American ministry . " David would have continued to insist but Mr. Morris explained that he had arranged to take Mme. de Flahaut riding in the Bois de Boulogne and could waste no more time . The young man came away from his minister in an extremely depressed frame of mind . In the days that followed he despaired of doing anything for the little birdlike marquis who was so securely caged in the frowning edifice on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile . There was no one to whom he could turn . Alain continued to exist like a depressed sleepwalking figure in the chambers on the Rue Vivienne . He expressed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really the insurrectionalCommune of Paris ) failed to arouse any curiosity in him . Whenever David endeavoured to engage him in conversation he answered readily enough but there appeared to be no will or thought in what he had to say . To the American this was amazing , for he remembered Alain 's old enthusiasm , his hero worship of Danton , his long immersion in the political activities on the left bank of the Seine and his reckless adherence to the impossible ideals of the Cordeliers Club . Now there was none of that fire left in Alain . He was like a youth who had been caught up in a whirlwind of excitement and then mercilessly dropped from a high altitude . He wasP355stunned by the fall . And yet this did not seem to be an adequate explanation of Alain 's curious sickness of mind . If the young Frenchman had been abruptly and cruelly disillusioned his outraged sensibilities might be stunned for a brief period but they would not freeze so for an eternity of hours and days . No , it was more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this problem of the pathological somnambulist . He struggled in vain . What could be done to medicine a man whose chilled responses left the anxious doctor floundering in uncertainty and abysmal ignorance ? What regimen , herbs or druggetscould provoke a desire to health in a man whose body was unailing but whose mind slept in a mysterious trance ? " There is little or nothing that I can do , " decided David , " until I understand what maggot is eating his brain . " He adjusted himself , therefore , to a casual comradeship ( " at least , he will see that I have not changed " ) and discussed , as thousands of others were discussing , the abnormal face of Paris without expecting too much response . Alain listened or drifted into one of his trancelike states of disregard . This abnormal face of Paris was growing grim . The tenth of August had come as a shock but after two or three days of startled inertia the shops opened again and the wheels of daily life began to function in a tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth , was grimly amused to read : " Mme. Broquin continues to sell her flesh-coloured pomade which dyes red or white hair to chestnut or black in a single treatment . The price of the pomade is nine francs a pot . " And they had not even finished burying the corpses that had fallen in the Tuileries Gardens ! Two days before , the royal family had been removed to the Temple , the former dwellingof the Comte d'Artois , and the Commune had served a gala dinner in the hall where Mozart had once played the clavecin for the Prince de Conti . There were people who continued to refer to Louis as the King . But the grim expression was steadily growing on the face of Paris . Already malevolent Prudhomme was crying , " People , protectyourselves from a false pity , from a criminal indulgence that only encourages the scoundrels . . . The cadaverous souls of the Bourbons are closed to all remorse . . . You commend them to French honour : it is praiseworthy to be honourable toward a generousenemy but not toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ultimate designs of the leaders of the insurrection . And the tightening grasp of the Commune on the city was increasingly apparent . It was difficult to leave Paris . Many of the foreign ministers , lucky enough to possess the necessaryp356passports , had gone but the Venetian ambassador was ignominiously brought back on a paltry excuse and all the other foreigners who did not possess diplomatic privileges were insultingly refused travellingpapers . A wretched journalist was beheaded for lese-nation , his crime being that he had written against the Jacobin Club . Domiciliaryvisits for concealed arms were taking place in all districts and one of the victims of this unwarranted search was Mr. Morris , the insult to his ministerial immunity well-nigh driving him into an apoplexy of rage . The immediate excuse for all this illegal interference with private life was the rapid advance of the Duke of Brunswick and his troops . The invaders , once they had crossed the French border , moved with a frightening celerity and by the twenty-eighth of August , eighteen days after Louis had been toppled from his throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have pushed their vanguard to Saint-Menchon . With this news the domiciliary visits and arbitrary arrests increased tenfold and a mounting hysteria convulsed Paris . The Commune , seeing its short existence dreadfullythreatened by the apparently resistless Austrians and Prussians , expressed itself in a savagery of despair . On the Place du Carrousel , before the great door to the Tuileries , a new instrument of execution was raised . It was called the guillotine . And from his prison cell , where he had been incarcerated since August thirteenth ( his crime being that he was a salaried employee of the deposed despot ) , an executionerwas released and brought to the Place du Carrousel . He was called Sanson . The first head that fell was that of Collenot d'Angremont , secretary of administration for the National Guard . On September second proclamations were pasted up all over Paris announcing that the enemy was at the gates of Paris and the general alarm was raised . Hushed voices began to ask what miracle could save the Commune . Citizen Fleury , his close-set eyes almost meeting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeve of his jacket and conversed volubly in agitated undertones . David watched them with some bewilderment from his chair near the window where he sat uninterestedly holding the latest copy of the Moniteur . He had not seen Citizen Fleury since the day of Marat 's unexpected visit and now he was both amused and amazed to observe the appearance of the printer 's boy . Citizen Fleury was draped in a huge sash and an enormous cavalry sabre thrust into it threatened to trip him up every time he moved . Was it possible that Citizen Fleury was going to war ?   " No , not Danton , " exclaimed Alain suddenly in a loud voice . " He never . . . " Citizen Fleury glanced suspiciously at David and shook Alain vigorously by the arm . The steady stream of his words was like the hissing of geese . " Very well , " said Alain , putting a halt to the visitor 's spate of words and wrenching his coat sleeve free . " I understand you . You need not repeat everything a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Citizen Fleury clattered down the stairs . " Is Citizen Fleury off to the wars ? " inquired David in an amused voice . " If so , I tremble for the Prussians . " " What ? " asked Alain . " Oh , no . I gathered from the boy 's garbled information that the Commune has been apprised of a concertedattempt on the part of the prisoners to break free from the houses of detention this evening . " " Impossible , " said David composedly as he returned to his journal . Alain stood for a moment indecisively in the centre of the room and then walked slowly into his own chamber . David glanced up and down the smudged columns of the Moniteur without any interest . It was close on five o'clock and the light in the room was failing. le flung down the paper finally and stood up and yawned . He could hear Alain moving about in the next chamber . The drums that had been beating the generale all day still sounded dull and grumbling in the distance . " Alain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . It opened and the young Frenchman appeared . He was wearing his cloak and hat and carrying his brace of pistols . " You are not going out , " exclaimed David unbelievingly . " I have been ordered to report to a Citizen Maillard at La Force , " responded Alain briefly . " But . . . but . . . how ridiculous ! " stuttered David . " If there is any danger of an uprising in the prison surely there are enough armed men from the sections . . . " " The whole affair sounds impossible to me , " agreed Alain , " but Fleury insists that the orders are direct from Danton . I must go . " " Then I am going with you , " declared David as he glanced about for his hat . There was a flicker of light in Alain 's dull eyes for a moment . I Iis marble-like face that for so many days had expressed neither concern nor excitement broke into a living map of affection and his lips spontaneously parted as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasserted itself.  | " You are a foreigner , " he said flatly . " It would be dangerous for you to walk the streets this evening . " " Danger or no danger , " replied David , " I am going with you . " Alain waited stolidly while the American found his hat and clapped it on his head . A moment later they passed down the stairs and emerged into the deserted stretch of the Rue Vivienne . They walked through the Palais-Royal . Strangely enough , David saw that the tree-shaded expanse of garden and the surrounding wooden galleries with their innumerable shops and entertainments were emptied of the usual motley press of loiterers . A sombre cloud had spread across the heavens and this deepened the early twilight . In the subdued light the colonnades and house-fronts loomed strangely , more like masks of edifices than substantial stone and wood . It occurred to David that a fierce gust of air might blow them all over . When the two young men reached the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and turned down it a feeling of uneasiness began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked Alain suddenly . " Where are all the people ? " Alain shook his head . Through the open grille of a boutique a white flash of new publicationscaught David 's eye and he paused to see what they were about . The pamphlets , obviously fresh from the printing press , winked their black-lettered title-pages up at him . Grande trahison de Louis Capet . Complot decouvert pour assassiner clans la nuit du 2 au 3 de ce mois , tous les bons citoyens de la capitale , par les aristocrates et les pretres refractaires aides des brigands et des scelerats detenus clans les prisons de Paris , signe Charles Boussemart , patriote sans moustaches . " How ridiculous ! " exclaimed David , indicating the pamphlets to Alain . The young Frenchman glanced at them as though he could not read . When they passed the Hotel de Ville David observed that a coalblackstandard was flying from the central tower . The alarm-gun from the Pont-Neuf continued to thud at measured intervals and the great bell of **25;4131;TOOLONG flung its lugubrious notes into the smoky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an actual fear . He knew that the tocsin which warned Paris that the foreign invaders were nearing the city had been pealing since two o'clock in the afternoon and he had heard the clank of arms as the Federes marched to the Champ-de-Mars for their mustering , and all of this had been exciting ; but now , P359beneath this deepening twilight that settled like smoke into the cleared streets , his excitement shifted into a horrified trepidation , an intimationof an impending terror that was neither Austrians nor Prussians but something dark and awful that lurked in every blind alley and blocked cul-de-sac . It was of no avail to mutter , " I low ridiculous ! " for the rapid uprush of his fear was not to be stifled by words . Just beyond the Hotel de Ville Alain stopped short and laid his hand on David 's shoulder . " You must go back , " he said . It was as though he was answering the unspoken thoughts of his friend . " We must both go back , " replied David . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must go where I am ordered to go , " asserted Alain stonily , " but you must go back to the Rue Vivienne and lock the doors . " " But , Alain . . . " protested David . " Will you go back ? " shouted Alain . " I do not want you with me ! " The American stared in offended amazement at his friend . " Oh , for the love of God ! " exclaimed Alain brokenly . He thrust his arm fiercely about David 's shoulder . " It will be better for me if you return to the Rue Vivienne , " he said . " Can not you feel the air ? It is not an air for Americans . 1 ) o you not hear the bells and the cannon ? Are you not aware that Paris is half-mad . Go back , David . " " Come with me , " insisted the American . They stood like two lost creatures clutching each other in the middle of a desert . " I can not go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not go back even if I desired to . I do n't know if I will ever go back . If anything happens . . . " His voice died away for a moment . From the Place de Greve there came a sound of hurried marching feet . " Go , David , " continued Alain in the same low voice . " You can not help me here . There is no one . . . " He stopped and turned his white face away . Then without glancingat David again he began to walk rapidly down the Rue SaintAntoine . The American , momentarily incapable of movement , watched the distance lengthen between them . After a moment he , too , turned and began to walk , but in the other direction . It was dark when David , strolling at a slow pace , reached the Place des Victoires on his way to the Rue Vivienne . His fear of faring abroad on this ominous evening was tempered by his concern for Alain . More than once he had meditated turning in his tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alain 's last words he seemed to sense something gloomy and prophetical in them , a hint that might have been subconscious in itself that he was going to more than a simple guard-duty at one of the prisons , that , in fact , he was on his way to a crucial moment in his life . But that did not make sense . How many men could anticipate the crucial moments in their lives ? Yet it was patent that Alain 's sombre intuition warned him of unknown possibilites . He had said , " I do n't know if I will ever go back . If anything happens . . . " But what could happen ? And yet . . . what could not happen in this hysterical and unbalancedcity of Paris where kings were caged in towers and bull-necked lawyers lorded it at the Ministry of Justice ? If only Mr. Morris were available . . . With his head bowed down and his mind entangled in the mesh of his troubled conjectures David walked into the very midst of a body of armed men that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , " barked the man against whom he had inadvertentlystumbled and a strong arm thrust him rudely aside . As David , startled by the collision and jostled free of his scattered thoughts , lifted his head a vast pig-like crimson countenance flashed before his eyes . The American stood rooted to the spot as the armed band hurried across the Place des Victoires . Pret-a-Boire ! That face , indelibly stamped upon his memory , was as unique and unchanged as it had been that far-away day in the Rue des Ballets . If Pret-a. - Boire was abroad this eveningCitizen Fleury 's face suddenly sprang out of the darkness at Alain . It was twisted in a grimace of acute pain and the close-set eyes flickered like candle flames in a wind . The youth gulped twice before he spoke . " It seems that this Maillard is at the Abbaye , " he stuttered . " Here , take this . Citizen Renier is in command here . I just saw Rossignol , one of the judges , passing in . I . . . I must . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rue Saint-Antoine while he was speaking and his jumbled words died in the clash of armed men . Forms materialized about Alain , bits of darkness that suddenly be-P361came men , and the streaky yellow glint of a lantern lighted the corner of the Rue des Ballets . The young Frenchman stood holding the sabre that Citizen Fleury had thrust into his hand and staring around at the muttering figures already beginning to move up the short thoroughfare toward the faintly-illuminated door of the prison of La Force . A broad hand pushed him forward . " Come , citizen , " grumbled a voice in his ear . " We are not here to observe . The judges are already at work . " Alain recognized Pierre-Nicolas Renier , better known as le grand Nicolas , one of the unruly swordsmen of no known vocation who belonged to Marat 's bloc in the Cordeliers Club . " What judges ? " inquired the young man . " Is it true that the prisoners . . . " " Forward , forward , " commanded le grand Nicolas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dozen to fifteen men surrounding Alain paused before it a red-faced jailer , obviously drunk , thrust his head out , observed them and then stumblinglyretreated into the corridor . Alain turned to the man nearest him . " How long are we assigned to guard-duty here ? " he asked . The man peered unbelievingly at him . " Guard-duty ! " he echoed and broke into a sudden mirthless laugh . " Just long enough to cut the guts out of one or two hundred aristocraticbastards . Do you belong to the section of the Quatre-Nations ? Were you not at the Abbaye this afternoon ? We made mince-meat ofThe red-faced jailer 's head protruded from the prison door again . " First judgment , " he called in a hoarse voice . " To the Abbaye ! " Growling exclamations of satisfaction greeted this cryptic judgmentand half a dozen sabres flashed in the air . Every one of them was stained with blood . It was at this instant , while the remarks of the man beside him were slowly sinking into his benumbed consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like nothing so much as ice breaking up in a choked river . Moving jerkily backward like an automatic figure , he staggered against the barrel-like borne That marked the corner of the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile and the Rue des Ballets . He could no longer hear anything but the monstrous crackingnoise in his head . The men about him , intent on their purpose , were hurrying forward , weapons lifted and lips drawn back over their teeth . Alain stared unblinkingly at the prison door while the crackling roar rose to a crescendo in his skull . A tiny figure , like a boneless puppet , was thrust suddenly throughP362the lighted oblong and as it stumbled down the two steps to the squarecobbledstreet Alain recognized the Marquis de Meyracq . The old nobleman 's mouth was open and as he dazedly turned his head from side to side he appeared to be saying something . He lifted his birdlikehands to protect himself but even as he did so a sabre flashed in the yellow light and a great black smear sprang out with incredible rapidity over all one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disappeared in a turmoil of men and all Alain could see were hunched backs and the jerky plunge of arms . This spectacle dissolved instantaneously into an impenetrable darkness and when the young man 's eyes again functioned he observed that he was running along the Rue Saint-Antoine with the sabre still clutched in his hand . He had turned into a narrow street of blank walls and closed gates . Almost blindly , thrusting his hands stiffly forward against the metal-knobbed expanse of weather-beaten wood , he pushed and to the screeching sound of rusty hinges staggered across the low beamlinteland fell sprawling upon square cobblestones fringed with untended grass . For a long time he lay where he had fallen , the blade of the sabre dully gleaming beside him , while the roaring in his head gathered in violence until his body seemed to rock with it . He was in a pool of misty moonshine , inert , almost breathless , his face pressed against the cool stones and his fingers clutched into the grassy crevices . There was no will in him to move and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his head . Presently he turned his face from the damp smell of the stones and stared before him . IIe was in the courtyard of the house in the Rue des Perles . Before him rose the dark bulk of the building , its windows all unlighted and an early drift of leaves fallen across the three shallow steps that led to the barred door . As he stared at the untenanted dwelling , raising himself from the ground by his hands but remaining on his knees , his soul seemed to rise slowly through a dark sea of blood . Quite suddenly his vision was clarified and the house , the windows , the door , even the coped metal monk that hung as knocker broke through the tenebrous shadows into sharp miraculous outline . It was as though the world had fallen away from the house and it stood in dazzling isolation against a clear moon-bathed sky . It was like a house on a high hill with nothing behind it but the great curtain of the lighted heavens . It did not seem strange to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P363As he stared at the locked door through which he had passed so many times the clarity that had drawn his vision from semi-blindness slipped like a celestial glow through the tortuous chambers of his mind . The long roar ebbed and he seemed to understand everything at once . Through some magic of the uncalled will his comprehension reached out , a widening circle that included the past , the present and the future , and he felt himself the master of himself at last . It was as though the great kaleidoscope of his intelligence , up to this moment a crazy juxtaposition of coloured fragments , had been turned by a mysterious hand and all the pieces had fallen simultaneouslyinto a reasonable pattern . He knew he had been mad . He knew he was sane . The house seemed to speak to him and he seemed to return this speech . It was like a reproach , this house , and his attitude before it was an admission , a plea for forgiveness and a wild desolation of regret . Somewhere in the distance behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickly-spined chestnut husk out of which he had burst . In the darkness of that world men were slaughtering helpless victims and the stones in the moonlight were black with blood . There was horror there , and lies and fanaticism and calculatingpretension , destruction for the sake of destruction and destructionfor the lying plausibilities of an impossible theory . There was more than blood on the stones in that world ; there was blood on the souls of the men who dominated it , as well . He did not shudder at the thought of all the blood and neither was he surprised at this freedom from an old fear that had shaken him since childhood . He was liberated from the fear of blood because he had waded through it to this moment and still lived . He who had trembled before the ensanguined body of a shot rabbit or a speared boar in the marshy fens of Saint-Mars had outreached the pusillanimities of his body by enduring a grief and an anger and a madness that were terrible with blood and passion . He was beyond the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted house was Gethsemane , then had he drained the Cup . It seemed to him that the whirling sabre that had cloven the Marquis de Meyracq 's little eggshell skull had been the supreme gesture of some inscrutable god and that that gesture had transformed him as the wizard 's flourishedwand had transformed the beast into a man . In that instant when his confined soul had touched the absolute nadir of horror the walls of his madness had split apart to a great roaring and he had found himself naked but sane in an illimitable space outside his monstrous prison . The sabre had fallen on the Marquis de Meyracq'shead and Alain 's grey dungeon alike .   All of this instantaneous comprehension was as much feeling as thought and with it came a great gush of relief that shook him into tears . Still on his knees with his hands touching the cold stones , he gazed through streaming eyes at the house while the illumination seemed to spread from his soul to the courtyard . He was kneeling in a lighted space . He was risen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the world of impenetrable darkness , resurrected from the bloody sea to the moon-shot uplands above the storm . Wiser men than he might say that he had been shocked free from the malady of a self-eating obsession by an unimaginable murder , that the thwarted cross-purposes of his will so entangled in the dubious passions of the times had been miraculously liberated by a great blow against the sleeping nature that was really himself ; wiser men might say this , but he knew it was more than that . He was conscious of a miracle . What could he say to the house ? But what need was there to say anything ? The house understood , as he understood , that he who had lost himself in devious ways had found himself again . There was no necessity to confess that his stunned will had suddenlyrevolted against everything that had sucked him into the prison from which he was freed , that his hero worship of Danton was dead , that he saw that man and all those who followed him wet to the , elbows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be misdirected by callous leaders into paths of suppression that were viler than the injustices of the old regime , that he believed man in the mass to he an irrational beast and equality either a fool 's delusion or a scoundrel 's rapacity and fraternity a lie oti the lips of a pack of wolves who sought to fatten on nobler game . And all this seemed to have flashed into his mind in the dizzy illuminationof a minute . Indeed , it seemed to have been always in his mind but drugged and lying quiescent beneath the overpowering madness that had dominated him for so many months . How could he have been so blind ? How could he have been so insensible ? Was it because his weak will had fed on specious theories felicitously proffered him while the reality had always been concealed ? Had it taken the blood on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile really to teach him the consequences of violent revolution ? But the house knew all these things . He lifted his hands , cold from the stone , to wipe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mind . He seemed to see her standing in the doorway , a faint glow against the dark wood . She was recoiling from him , her face halfavertedand one arm thrust forward in a gesture of refusal . Hep365accepted the vision submissively . The old passion that had eaten into his soul like the acid of an alchemist had vanished . It had passed with the demolished walls of the prison that had contained him . He was as free of this madness as he was of the other . Anne-Marie would never have to flee from him again for the man she had fled from no longer existed . Long ago he had placed her in the temple o f his adoration and he had blundered into that temple and laid sacrilegious hands upon the goddess and now the altar-place was empty . The goddess had fled but the temple still waited for her return . Perhaps she would learn in time . . . He knew now what lie had subconsciously known always  --  that he would never possess her , and yet the realization aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he accepted his sanity . The phantom projected by his mind faded slowly from the locked door and as it faded it seemed to half-turn toward him while the protesting arm dropped as it vanished . He would go away . There was self-preservation in exile and in exile he could re-establish himself as that man who had so newly entered his distracted body . He rose slowly to his feet , one heel striking agaist the forgotten sabre that lay on the ground . It did not matter where he went so long as it was not in France . Belgium . The Low Countries . England , perhaps . The inscrutable god who had touched him to sanity would show the way . He turned toward the open gate through which he had blundered so instinctively and behind him the blank unlighted windows of the house incuriously observed his departure . In the courtyard the sabre lay like a curved strip of opaque water on the grass-fringed cobblestones.
