txt The Senate , by a 33-to-15 vote , passed and sent to the Assembly today the Dunnigan concurrent resolution legalizing pari-mutuel betting on horse races in the State . The resolution was passed at the 1938 session of the Legislature , and if approved by the Assembly , to complete the required second passage , it will be submitted to the people at the Fall elections . The vote on the resolution cut sharply across party lines , with fifteen Republicans and seventeen Democrats voting in the affirmative and nine Republicans and six Democrats in the negative . The passage of the resolution in the upper house marked a personal victory for its author , Senator John J. Dunnigan of New York City , Democratic minority leader , who for the last five years has waged a continual fight against the bookmakers now operating in this State . Tliz resolution is expected to be passed by the Assembly when it is brought up next week . The resolution has as its sponsor in that house Norman F. Penny , Manhasset Republican , and , according to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday night . Mr. Dunnigan 's resolution will be substituted for the Penny one on Tuesday and the final vote is expected to be taken on the same day . $10,000,000 Revenue Is Seen Senator Dunnigan has contended repeatedly that the State is losing much revenue by not putting pariinutuels into effect . He estimates that the State will receive about $10,000,000 annually in revenue from the betting machines . When the resolution was reported favorably out of the Senate Finance Committee , Senator Dunnigan immediately asked for unanimous consent to bring it up for final vote . Senator John T. McCall , Manhattan Democrat , objected to immediate consideration and asked Senator Dunnigan to withold final action until Monday night . When Senator Dunnigan refused , Senator McCall left the chamber , whereupon Senator Dunnigan asked for a meeting of the Rules Committee . This request was granted and the committee , headed by Senator Joe R. Hanley , Republican majority leader , after a brief session granted consent for immediate consideration . In his speech in defense of his resolution Senator Dunnigan held that the question was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shall we supplant it with a system of pari-mutuel bet-ting ? " For " Honest , Scientific Odds " " Shall we tolerate a bookmaking system operated in violation of the Constitution or a pari-mutuel system operated legally under authority of the Constitution ? " he added . " Shall we perpetuate a bookmaking system , allowing profit-seeking individuals to regulate odds with small regard for supply and demand or shall we install a mechanized system of honest , scientific odds arrived at by strict adherence to supply and demand ? " He asked , too , whether New York was going to continue to be the " ugly duckling " among racing States . In discussing the possible revenue for the State through legalization of pari-mutuels , Senator Dunnigan said the yield was unpredictable but might easily reach $10,000,000 a year . Last year New York , without parimutuels , he said , received only $595,858 in taxes from race meetings , mainly through the admissions ' tax . Florida , Massachusetts and California , with pari-mutuels , received $1,186,511 , $1,294,549 and $2,661,148 , respectively . Mr. Dunnigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as that of Florida or Massachusetts and almost as long as California 's , and " the amount of wagers in this State is larger than in other States , " he added . Jersey Possibility Cited Calling attention to the fact that New Jersey will hold a referendum ck pari-mutuels on June 20 , Senator Dunnigan asserted that if New Jersey approved pari-mutuels , New York tracks , with bookmaking betting , would lose a considerable amount of business . " Our people will crowd the tunnels , ferryboats and bridges for a chance to bet under the preferred system , " he stated . " The race courses which will be constructed on the west bank of the Hudson River will flourish and our own will become deserted . " I am grieved at the possibility . Not alone because local taxes will One be collected at the tills of another State , but also because a gloridus tradition , horse racing in New York State , will come to an end . I say , pass this resolution and let the people of our State decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution , that it would " make the State a partner in gambling , " while Senator Williamson , Republican , asserted that once the anti-gambling ban was lifted for pari-mutuels , other forms of gambling would be legalized . Besides Senators Kleinfeld and Williamson , those who voted against the resolution were Senators Buckley , , Murray , Perry and Quinn , Democrats , and Senators Condon , Desmond , Graves , Hampton , Mitchell , Seelye , Stagg and Thompson , Republicans .
