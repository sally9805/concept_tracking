txt As a sidelight upon the operations of the Inland Waterways Corporation , it may be profitable to spend a few minutes on consideration of the Peoria Barge Terminal which was formally opened last summer . This enterprise was undertaken as an adjunct to the Federal Barge Line , but is the property of the City of Peoria . It was voted despite considerable opposition on the part not merely of the railroads but of many of the business men of the city . A bond issue of $400,000 was provided and sold upon terms which required annual payments for interest and amortization of $30,981 on an annual average for 19 years , which with insurance , brings the average annual payments of the city to $31.213 , excluding ' maintenance and depreciation . No definite contract has yet been made between the city and the Federal Barge Line for use of the terminal . The Barge Line has been using it on an informal agreement by paying to the city 15 cents for each ton of revenue freight handled through the terminal , and is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than this on revenue freight and will pay nothing on non-revenue freight . Nor will it absorb charges of railroads for track rental and car-hire , which I must be paid by the city . These charges are estimated at not less than 5 cents a ton on an average ; if the city absorbs them , there are left for it 10 cents a ton . Big Tonnage Discrepancy Consequently to meet the annual charges for interest. , amortization and insurance , excluding maintenance and drprectation , there will have to be handled 312,000 tons of revenue freight per annum . This must be done during the navigation season , i. e .. nine months , which indicates a monthly revenue tonnage requirement of something under 35.000 tons . Thus far , for three and one-half months to September 30. the total revenue tonnage handled at the terminal was 13,177 tons , an average of something under 4,000 tons per month . The payments by the Federal Barge Line to the City of Peoria for the same period amounted to $1,977 . Operations were to be closed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that these Initial operations are necessarily a fair guide to what may be expected to develop later , but the discrepancy between 4.000 tons and 35,000 tons is so large as to indicate that the City of Peoria has made a pretty bad bargain . What traffic may ultimately develop at this terminal in admittedly problematical . That it will reach anything like 312,000 tons a year seems on its face impossible in view of the fact that in 1930 the total traffic of the Federal Barge Line at St. Louis ( including East St. Louis ) was but 401.277 tons , at Cairo 433,649 tons , at Memphis 275,667 tons , at ' Vicksburg 71,521 tons , and at Baton Rouge 40,094 tons . All these terminals have been in operation for a long time ; Cairo has been the principal railwater transfer point . and Memphis is an important warehouse district of the Barge Line . as recent controversies before the Interstate Commerce Commission have disclosed . What chance has Peoria to match these figures ? Besides . Cairo , Memphis , ' Vicksburg and Baton Rouge have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ! It is not surprising that Peoria is commencing to believe that someone has deceived it . Dubuque Pays While upon this subject , let ' a s also look at Dubuque . Some four years ago this city built a water terminal for the exclusive use of the Federal Barge Line at a net cost ( to April , 1930 ) of about $371.000 . The Barge Line leased the terminal , operates it , maintains it , and pays the city 15 cents a ton on all freight handled therein . The city has outstanding $347,000 of bonds calling for average annual payments to 1947 of about $29,000 . In order to collect this amount the traffic through the terminal must amount to about 193,000 tons per annum ; and this must move during a navigation season of about eight months  --  a monthly requirement of some 24,000 tons . The terminal handled in 1928,24,065 tons of the Federal Barge Line 's freight : in 1929. 40,454 tons , and in 1930 , 39,330 tons . In the last two years , therefore , tonnage has been only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgo on bond interest and sinking fund and insurance . The net loss to the taxpayers of Dubuque on this enterprise to the end of the fiscal year , 1930-31. amounts to over $58,000 , exclusive of depreciation . Notwithstanding this showing , it is now proposed that the city issue $150,000 bonds to construct a coal dock to be leased to a West ' Virginia corporation at a rental of 5 cents a ton on coal handled over the dock . This would require the handling of about 245,000 tons of coal per annum . Dubuque consumes , locally , less than 10,000 tons a year of eastern coal , which comes mainly from Illinois and western Kentucky ! What earthly chance is there that any such tonnage could be handled at the dock ? How much longer are taxpayers , local and national , going to allow themselves to be deceived by the superstition that transportation on inland artificial waterways is economical ?
