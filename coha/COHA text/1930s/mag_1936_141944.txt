U. S. Drys tend to be sentimentalists , exultant over small victories and busy with niggling activities pending what they believe to be the inevitable return of Prohibition . Last week many a Dry was gratified to hear a comparatively substantial gain by The Cause : the name and cheery figure of Santa Claus are to be banned in holiday liquor advertising in no less than 30 States . Research on this question was done by Ethel Hubler , editor-publisher of a Los Angeles Prohibition paper called the National Voice , who wrote to State liquor control boards wherever they exist . A model State , she discovered , is Iowa which permits no liquor display or advertising of any kind . Only State whose board actually favors linking Santa Caus with liquor is New York . There authorities declared that the patron of Christmas is " not actually a saint , but a character of fiction , not a Biblical character , but merely the symbol of happiness and good cheer . " <P> New York 's board was only partly right . The original of Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia Minor , of whom little is known save that he was a 4th Century bishop . In the 11th Century , Italians of Bari stole his body , built a basilica about it , attributed to the saint many a miracle . St. Nicholas became the patron of Russia , Greece , the Kingdom of Naples , Sicily , Lorraine , Limerick , of children , pawnbrokers , mariners , coopers , brewers . Children came to expect secret gifts from St. Nicholas on the eve of his feast ( Dec. 6 ) . This far from notable bishop did indeed become a public character when the gift-giving was transferred to Christmas Day . His now familiar garb is of Russian origin , his U. S. name a corruption of the Dutch San Nicolaas .
