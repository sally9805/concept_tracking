California had not long to wait last week for the first use of its new law permitting peremptory challenge of the judge assigned to try a case ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . Grey-topped , crotchety , bushy-eyebrowed Superior Judge Frank H. Dunne , 67 , one of the old-timers on San Francisco 's bench , had just opened court with the case of Howe v. Howe , an action to set aside a property settlement on a wife . Up popped noisy Lawyer Jacob Wilbur ( " Jake " ) Ehrlich , 37 , who once successfully defended Alexander Pantages against a rape charge . Said he , " Your Honor , it gives me great pleasure to avail myself of Section 170.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure . . . . " Thus he asked that the case be transferred to another judge . The momentary silence in the courtroom was acute . The judge was slightly abashed . While conversation buzzed the request was referred to Presiding Judge C. Julian Goodell who transferred the case , assigned it to another judge for trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
