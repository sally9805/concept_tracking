Because they increase wing drag , wing deicers* are usually removed from U. S. airline transports during summer . Last week all wing deicers were off , but this time there was an added reason for their removal-they have been causing trouble on the new Douglas DC-38 . On one American Airliner last month the rubber boot split , on another a section of the wing 's skin crystallized and tore away . These incidents were minor , but enough to cause a Bureau of Air Commerce request that all present deicers be removed from DC-38 and improved to meet the greater stresses imposed by this biggest of U. S. land transports . <P> Similar trouble encountered before when bigger planes went into service has always been successfully overcome . Last week Douglas Aircraft Co. was busy perfecting a reinforcement for the wing where the de-icer is attached , and B. F. Goodrich Co .. maker of the deicers , was busy hunting for a way to strengthen the rubber . Both promised results by next ice weather . <P> *Rubber boots on the leading edge that pulsate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
