Smoking election torches marched through Dublin streets by night last week . " Up de Valera ! " roared the torch bearers , and Ireland 's hero was carried shoulder high . Excited Irishmen swore on every hand that Eamon de Valera would soon succeed William Thomas Cosgrave as President of the Irish Free State . With a third of the votes still to be counted , Mr. Cosgrave conceded grimly , " It looks as though my Government would go out . " <P> All over Ireland the election was proving every minute that what the Irish want is a hero-in which respect they differ from the English . <P> There was no landslide away from Mr. Cosgrave to Mr. de Valera . Wherever a Cosgrave candidate was the local hero he won , no matter how the vote in general was going . <P> Cork city went with a pop for her hero , President Cosgrave . County Clare whooped in Mr. de Valera . And Tipperary ! Sure and in Tipperary they elected who but Dan Breen himself . <P> Dan was living only last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born ) . American money in a grand old Irish way makes Irish history , has made it for 90 years . But Tipperary elected Dan Breen last week just because he is such a rip-roaring ould bouchal . Twenty actual times the British have put actual bullets into him . On Dan 's head His Majesty 's Government once had a price of 10,000 ( $48.600 then ) for his capture . <P> When they got Dan into prison at last , the British tried to change him from one wing of the prison to another . But Dan would not go . Not until they lugged in a machine gun and trained it on Dan . That decided him to walk . In jail he was elected a Deputy in 1923 , so why should not Tipperary elect Dan Breen now ? <P> " Old Men . " Seasoned diplomats , accustomed to premiers who are well over 60 , have been simply astounded to find on visiting Ireland that the average age of President Cosgrave and the members of his Cabinet is only 45 . <P> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people-old not in age but in the length of time they have held power . Mr. Cosgrave has been President uninterruptedly since 1922-nearly ten years . Such a thing is not tolerated in the U. S. , and the Irish people were not in a tolerant mood last week . The record of Cosgrave who was born in Dublin and the record of his Government-both excellent records-did not matter . Ten years is too long for a man to be President . <P> The great fact of these ten years is that southern Ireland , called " The Irish Free State , " has enjoyed far greater freedom than ever before . It has " dominion status , " is therefore technically as free as Canada . It has even enjoyed greater prosperity during the decade than almost any other part of King George 's realm . <P> But His Majesty is precisely the fly in the Irish unguent of freedom . King George may seem a mere emblem to the English , to the Canadians and even to             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
