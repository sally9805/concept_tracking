txt To the long list of price-fixing experiments which have collapsed in failure , Brazil has Just added her coffee control plan . Restriction has been abandoned for a return to freedom . No doubt the example will not deter price-fixers in other countries ; for , if there is one subject about which producers think that " history is bunk . " it Is price-fixing . The trouble with Brazil was that she could not persuade her competitors to Join her in a program of scarcity economics . As the world 's largest coffee producer , she had me everything possible to restrict her own supplies . One of the methods adopted was to burn part of her crop . The spectacle , incidentally , provided the writers on " poverty in the midst of plenty " with one of their most vivid chapters . While Brazil was destroying crops , however , other countries were adding to their crops , as was the case , It may be recalled , in regard to rubber restriction . Consequently , the Brazilians had no option but to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A A In the twenties Brazil 's production , according to the statistical yearbook put out by the League of Nations , went up to three-quarters of world production . Now it is only a halt of the aggregate . This is bad enough from Brazil 's standpoint . Nevertheless , tf the price had been boosted , this loss of markets might have been offset , to some extent , by a greater return per bag of coffee . No such result , however , has been achieved . Coffee is one of the laggard commodities in climbing back to that 1926 level which in some quarters is regarded as a kind of norm of prices . Before Brazil dropped its control , rubber , silk and coffee were at the bottom of the list of world commodities in their percentage of 1926 prices . Coffee came ahead of rubber and silk , but not much . It was bringing in only half the 1928 price , despite Brazil 's self-denial ** , revolt to , her crop . It is a curious thing that , while other producing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from America 's self denial ? ? as regards cotton . Brazil steadily expanded cotton production as America restricted it . Now the United States is back in production again , with a crop estimated as the largest since 1932 . But foreign markets have not come back . Other producers , including Brazil , obtained more than a toehold in consumer markets while the United States was engaged in restriction . - Moreover , American cotton need not be sold at the world price . This privilege is the result of the pledge which Uneie'Sam made last Congress to guarantee a fixed price for cotton . The fixed price is 12 cents and will go to farmers " who have complied " with the " legislation contemplated " for 1938.1. e. , in the pending farm bill . With the price now around eight cents , doubtless many farmers are holding their cotton , and it looks as if the Farm Board ramp of Hoover days will be repeated . A A A In the South I see more and more references to the unwisdom of price-fixing . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view . In the Texas Business Review Just received , there is the following remark : World markets , such as the cotton market , are extremely sensitive to artificial interferences because they destroy commercial values . It is highly important that federal , subsidy loans , or loans above market juice , should be abandoned if we propose to hold our foreign markets for cotton . In addition to creating uncertainty in the market , loans above market price sustain the market for foreign competitors , and force the accumulation of surpluses to plague American producers . As to the loss of markets , the figures are telling . Prior to the World War the United States furnished about 45 per cent of the commercial cotton consumed outside the United States . During 1936-37 the United States furnished only 23 per cent . It do n't require the breakdown ' of the Brazilian price-Mting scheme to provide a warning of the results df a similar policy toward American cotton ,                   @ @
