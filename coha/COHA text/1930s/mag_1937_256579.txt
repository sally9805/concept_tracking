Loud protestations members of the Cabinet of Socialist Premier Leon Blum that they did not expect to have to devalue the franc further were followed last week by a thumping event which firmed the franc on international exchange , showed that London is standing with Paris in friendly entente . The event : British bankers loaned $250,000,000 at 3% , repayable within one year , to the French State railways . " I categorically deny , " keynoted French Finance Minister Vincent Auriol , " that our monetary unit will be permitted to move lower . " <P> One drastic expedient which the Socialist Premier has adopted to dissuade , although it does not prevent , French capitalists from shipping funds abroad in another " flight from the franc " likely to lead to devaluation , is the recent law forcing the French to divulge to their Government whatever funds they have abroad . This they passionately hate , for to the logical French mind it suggests that , once the Government knows what foreign funds its citizens have , the day will come when , under pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour la patrie . <P> Therefore last week the plight of a hitherto unnoticed Mme Drouard-Marquiset fascinated all prosperous French men . Secret agents had discovered in Switzerland at the Banque Commercials de Ble a deposit in the name of Mme Drouard-Marquiset which she had omitted to disclose , as required by law . Result : <P> Mme Drouard-Marquiset was jailed for three months ; she was " fined " 1,000 francs ( $46.60 ) and " penalized " 190,812 francs ( $8,896.60 ) ; she had to pay the costs of the Government 's having caught and punished her ; and for one month there will remain publicly posted up at the police station of her precinct in Paris a notice proclaiming " THE CONVICTION FOR FRAUD of Mme Drouard-Marquiset.
