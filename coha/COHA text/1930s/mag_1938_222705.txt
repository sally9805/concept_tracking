Most of the cotton South 's 1,700,000 tenant farmers live by The Book , and The Book is not the Holy Bible . It is a ledger where " furnish " is entered . Furnish is credit for " side meat " ( salt pork ) , molasses , corn meal , seed , sometimes for a mule and a plow . Landlords , or merchants dependent upon them , run The Book . Without furnish , few tenants could live through the winter , or plant in the spring . <P> In fall , after The Book is toted , a tenant 's crop may not be worth enough to pay for what he owes . If cotton is selling at io/ a Ib. or better , he may receive one or two hundred dollars . But he has an immense yearning for a store suit , a cotton dress for his wife , a few pretties for his children , perhaps a second-hand Chevrolet or a splendid , ancient Studebaker . So , either way he goes on living by The Book . <P> Chief difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Copeland plantation in Washington County , Miss. , and 200,000 other sharecroppers and renters in Mississippi , is that Less Taylor got for his lawyer old Percy Bell of Greenville , onetime chancery judge and independent as a hog on ice . Chief difference between Landlord Copeland and many another in the Yazoo Delta is that he did not get away with making a good thing of The Book . At Jackson last week , the supreme court of Mississippi reversed a Washington County Chancery judgment , declared : " According to the appellee 's Copeland 's own testimony , including his book account , there is no escape from the conclusion that he charged more than 20% per annum on the furnish account . " Thereby , ruled the court , Planter Copeland forfeited not only interest but principal , owes Negro Taylor $2,279.91 ( equal to the full value of his cotton without deduction for furnish ) . <P> This application of the law of usury was a nasty jolt to Mississippi 's cotton planters . It meant that henceforth they can not charge more than legal interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying it free .
