AMUSEMENT was the sort of precious stuff we tried to mine from all our hours at Friendship . So , when it was revealed on a certain afternoon that Calvin Coolidge was coming out expressly to learn the game of golf , some other golfers decided that they , too , would play that day . ? My recollection is that Mrs. Oscar Underwood played with me . I recall that Mrs. Coolidge took her knitting from a bag and smilingly announced that she was going to spend the afternoon in the shade on our veranda . The fourth person in the foursome I had arranged was McLeod , the professional . We waited and then Vice-President Coolidge arrived , having come directly From the Senate , over which he then presided . All our other golfers , such as President Harding , Senators Davis Elkins , of West Virginia ; Joseph Frelinghuysen , of New Jersey ; and Fred Hale , of Maine . were very dressy on the golf course . So were Ned , George Christian and William Gibbs McAdoo , who , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legal services . I have forgotten just why he had been retained . Well , as I say , those golfers and most of the others were usually attired as if they were about to pose for some fashion plate to illustrate what . should be worn on the golf course . Plus fours that year were flaring much wider than women 's skirts , and the hose men golfers wore were woven in designs of chessboard cheeks or dizzy alternating circles . Their caps were so generously made that I used to ask them , please not to let the breeze waft them up into the trees . Mr. Coolidge Takes Up Golf C ALVIN COOLIDGE was a different sort of golfer . He had a bag of clubs when he arrived ; he had played before , of course , but not enough to justify his playing with the Harding foursome . That day of which I speak he fixed himself for playing by simply taking off his coat . At that moment , in long pants and suspenders , he was almost ready to take a stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to take from his golf bag a white cotton hat lined with green . Its brim was turned up closely , saucer fashion . He was quite solemn , and both remembered and applied the morsels of advice tossed to him by the pro . I do not think that he spoke a word himself , however , until we reached the seventh hole . It was there that he addressed himself to me . " Your dress is wet in the back , " he said . " Thought you ought to know it . " I thanked him . As we approached the last hole , I heard a lot of noisy chatter , and then I saw President Harding and half a dozen of his companions lined up as a gallery . I beard them commenting gaily on Mr. Coolidge 's suspenders , as if to tease him . They had no hick at that , and finally I heard the President confess that he , too , wore suspenders . Eventually , through his practice out at Friendship , Mr. Coolidge became a quite fair golfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front porch . If we could induce them to remain for dinner , we were delighted . When our lawns were turning brown with fallen leaves that autumn , I had to give up golf myself , because I was going to have another child . My fourth child , and only daughter , was born on November 16 , 1921 . When she was about six weeks old I had her christened ; she had a little bonnet with a pink plume , a very long pink chiffon dress , a perfectly lovely thing . The ceremony orbaptism was held in the ballroom of the I Street house . I had an altar built in there and the child was baptized by the Bishop of Washington , the Rt . Rev. Alfred Harding , right on the scene of so many of our splendid parties . President and Mrs. Harding were the baby 's godparents , and there were a score or more of others present , including the Secretary of State and Mrs. Charles Ev.ans Hughes , the Secretary of War and Mrs. Johu W. Weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feat , to get the society-dodging Mr. Duke to pay us a visit . However , Nannie Lee Duke and I had been such good friends that I persisted until she succeeded in persuading Mr. Duke to come . Right after the bishop cleared oust that afternoon , we started playing bridge . President Harding , Mrs. Duke , Secretary Weeks and I played . Mrs. Harding felt  --  and said so  --  that her husband had a job to do over in Pennsylvania Avenue . She spoke of this to me , and then she spoke to him a time or two . " Warren , " she said , " you should be getting back to work . " He played an ace with table-banging force , but said no word . Presently she spoke again , " Warren , you really ought to be going back to work . " I watched the faces of my guests  --  the calm , the lovely , unperturbed features of Mrs. Duke , the twitching of Mrs. Harding 's lips , and the President 's black brows that were becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weeks . " Warren ! " Mrs. Harding spoke with undisguised sharpness . I passed , and then the President turned his head and declared himself . " I am going , " he said , " to play all afternoon . . . . Five spades doubled . " Disarmament Celebration W ITH diplomats and admirals of all the nations gathered in Washington for the Disarmament Conference , I turned some of my attention from my infant daughter to a scheme I had for giving a great big party . President 1-larding and Secretary Hughes had just astonished the people of the earth with a proposal to destroy battleships and limit future naval building in the interests of peace . It seemed to me that that was an excuse for an entertainment . Pale gold sateen with an overeloth or yellow lace was what I ordered for two of my three long dinner tables ; each of them was seventy-five feet long . The third table , placed in the ( Continued on Page 28 ) ( Continued front Page 261 middle , was covered with a silver cloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eandelabra given me for a wedding present . On the tables with the cloths of gold I placed , on one , the golden service left to us by John R .. and on the other the golden service of the Walshes . My father had bad that one made to his order , and in the center of each gilt-inerusted plate there is a Camp Bird fashioned out of gold , When those tables were set and the Brirberini tapestries covered the I Street ballroom walls , the scene was much more lovely than could be imagined . This Disarmament Conference dinner was the one at which I showed Griffith 's movie of the Gish sisters in Orphans of the Storm . That was the night that Alice Longworth sat on a gilt sofa between Senator Borah and Balfour . Hidden in his pocket , Balfour had a souvenir that I had given him . Just before leaving the dinner tables , so they could be cleared away , he and Lord Lee of Fareham came and subtly flattered me . They asked what cloth it was that shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the lights turned on , something woven out of Camp Bird ore . " It 's just ordinary sateen , " I gladly told them . Balfour let his scholarly blue eyes review the cluster massed at the doors ; most of the men that night wore handsome uniforms , not olive drabs but richly ornamented fabrics , their breasts all bright with jeweled decorations . Lord Lee fingered the yellow cloth and murmured that he would try to remember that the word was " sateen . " " You sha n't have to think about the word , " I said , " because I 'll let you have a. sample . " A servant brought a pair of scissors , and those two British gentlemen stood popeyed as I whacked off for each of them a square of yellow cloth . When I explained how inexpensive sateen really is , Lord Lee said that he would have something to tell his womenfolk when he got home . In the story of her life , Alice Longworth commented on the contrasting reactions of Balfour and Senator Borah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving picture , Orphans of the Storm . The scenes of the French Revolution were lurid , as Alice says , and the cruelties of the French nobles portrayed something that I know does not exist in the United States . With Alice for my reporter , I know that Balfour , on that occasion , as the picture story was unreeled , murmured near her ear from time to time , " Very moving ; very moving . " Borah , on the other hand , she says , behaved as if the scenes had been taken on the spot . She describes him as having been blazing with indignation at the cruelties . Well , something else that came from Mr. Borah that night . I want to have in my story . The senator from Idaho stood there in the ballroom in his somber evening clothes , surveyed our guests , our servants and the rich furnishings of the I Street . house . Then he spoke out loud , and according to my friends , what he said was , " This sort of thing is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made up my mind that , for a while at least , I would not subject the senator from Idaho to such a hazard . The next time I had a party I wrote to Mrs. Borah saying I knew her husband did not like dinner parties and evening clothes , but that I would be delighted to have her come . Mrs. Borah , in the first days of our acquaintance , had come to one of my parties and was standing right near me , unaware of my presence . I heard her say my name , and then - add , " She is right sweet-looking , and I suppose she would be all right if it was n't for that awful voice of hers . " Just then she saw me and turned another color . I walked over . " Mrs. Borah , " I began as sweetly as I could , " you know I come from the West , a mining camp , so what can you expect of me ? I ai n't a lady . " Poor Mrs. Borah ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not care what people say about me , if only they will tell the truth and , after all , that voice of mine is kind of rusty . Later in that winter of the Washington Disarmament Conference , my husband and I were at The Breakers in Palm Beach , awaiting word to proceed with another sort of entertainment we were planning for the President . We had under charter the Nahmeoka , the property of H. N. Baruch , a brother of Bernie , she was a houseboat with four double staterooms . In Washington , President Harding was no less eager than we to be off on a coastal-canal-andriver cruise in Florida . We had tempted him with comments on the golf courses and the freedom from ' the constant pressure at the White House . On February 10 , 1922 , Ned read aloud to me this letter : My dear Ned : I have just been having an interview with our mutual friend , the now Ambassador to Belgium Henry Fletcher . We are clinging to the hope that it will be possible to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not seem possible , however , to make this trip before the end of the first week in March . The Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes is leaving on the fifteenth for Bermuda and will be absent for at least two weeks . There is no possibility of the tinder 9mretary Henry Fletcher getting away during his absence . It would be rather difficult , certainly disappointing , to make up a party without him . Of course , there is the chance that the whole thing will go by the board , but I wanted to tell you we are still hoping , and I felt that if I told you 1 was sure we would not come before March sixth , you could probably be making other plans for the houseboat trip meanwhile . I hope you are having a very delightful time of it . Please give my very best regards to Evalyn . Very truly , WARREN G. HARDINO . On March 5 , 1922 , the President and Mrs. Harding , with a. small party of friends , left ' Washington , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tied up at St. Augustine . The others in the party were Attorney General Harry Daugherty ; Under Secretary of State Henry Fletcher ; General Sawyer ; the Speaker of the House , Frederick Gillett ; and George Christian . A Cruise With the Hardings T O MY notion , it was not highly successful as a party , but I think the men enjoyed themselves . Mrs. Harding was not really in good health at any time I knew her . We two spent most of our time aboard the boat , cruising ahead , while the men , after their golf , would follow in automobiles , coining aboard the boat in time , usually , for dinner , Mrs. Harding 's meals were supervised by Doctor Sawyer ; he kept her on a strict diet . Generally , in the evenings , we all played poker . After leaving Palm Beach , Ned and I returned to Washington for just a little while , and then we went north to Bar Harbor . Consequently , after the winter vacation , we had seen but little of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember seeing , as I hastened along a White House corridor , a wall clock with its black hands showing half-past nine . As I paused outside a wide door , some impulse of the clock mechanism made its long hand jump a trifle , so that I was startled . The movement gave me a melancholy feeling that there was not much time left for me or Mrs. Harding . She was sick . The news had come to me at Bar Harbor and , after an exchange of wires with Sawyer and along-distance talk with Harding , I had started for the capital on a special train . We broke , all records into Baltimore , and at Washington . I was met by Doris Christian Continued on Page 60 ) in a White House car . I was taken directly to the office of the President . Secretary Weeks was seated with him there . Mr. Harding had his arms stretched out before him on a. big desk blotter . " I am afraid Florence is going , " he said . " Surely , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can muster all the doctors ? " President Harding shook his head . " Finney and Mayo are here . They say her only chance to live is in an operation . Sawyer wo n't have it . Suppose you talk to him . " " Let me talk first with Finney . " I found Finney and Doctor Mayo , for both of whom I have profound respect. , shaking their heads over the state of affairs . There is no surgeon in the world that I rate higher than Finney . Mayo was downright mad because Sawyer was standing pat . He said he was so disgusted that he was ready to go home . " Let me go to work on Sawyer , " I said . So I saw Sawyer . I found him pacing up and down the floor just outside the bedroom where Florence Harding was lying , quite out of her senses from the effects of self-generated poisons . He was wearing russet-colored putties on his thin calves ; his uniform tunic was buttoned across his hollow chest . It seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars on his shoulders , to make them testify afresh each minute that he was , after all , a general . " Now look here , general , " I began ; " dr , you realize the load of responsibility you have taken on yourself ? " Doctor Sawyer 's Courage " Evelyn , " he said , and paused to emphasize his words . He was squinting behind his thick glasses . " I realize much more sharply than you can just how the country will think of me if Florence  --  if anything happens to her . " It almost seemed as if he hail the reluctance of a savage to name the thing he feared . Then he went on : " Finney and Mayo are great men , but I have pulled this woman through many and many a time . I know her constitution . I know what she can stand and I know she can not stand another operation . She lived just through luck or God the last time she went under ether . I was the surgeon then ; I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin , almost , just because I am convinced that if her heart holds out , the kidney stoppage will open up . I tell you , I 'm their family doctor . " He brushed his palms across his eyes , that small-town doctor from Ohio , and all of a sudden I wanted very much to hug him . He took me on tiptoe to the side of Mrs. Harding 's bed . As I looked , I thought , " She must be dead . " But she was not , and in the morning she was a trace improved . Slowly she eliminated poisons and slowly she began to mend . In the space of weeks she was being pushed around in a wheel chair . She lived because of Doctor Sawyer 's skill and con rage . Mrs. Harding used to rely on me to select her clothes . While she was getting well I took her a boudoir cap of lace shaped as a crown . She was deeply concerned just then because Warren had lost so much sleep during her illness . Time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every time they did , of course , the President was disturbed . That went on for weeks , and by day he worked at one of the hardest jobs in the world . No wonder he grew tired . Our last long time together with the Hardings was in March , 1923 . It was another vacation party on a houseboat we had chartered , The Pioneer , with seven staterooms , one with two beds and four having double berths . Our preparations were under way at Palm Beach in February when a letter came from the White House . It was dated February fifteenth , and it began : My dear Ned : Christian has shown me your letter , presumably written on the thirteenth , which arrived this morning . Our present plans are to leave here on the forenoon of the fifth and go directly to Ormond , in accordance with the plans which we discussed when I last saw you . We ought to arrive at Ormond on the fore noon of the sixth , and after proper salutations , we ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Ormond Beach course . When that is out of the way , we can proceed on a leisurely journey southward . No change has been made in any way concerning the personnel of the party . General Dawes will meet us at Ormond . You understand that Lasker and Speaker Gillett are to be in the party . You talked to me about General Daugherty and Mr. Smith . I think the General is making such progress toward recovery that he will be able to come , and I have no doubt he very much desires to have the Southern vacation , and I think it is a fine thing for him to have it if he is able to make the trip . I saw him briefly yesterday , but did not discuss the matter with him . I understand from General Sawyer that he is figuring on being a member of the party and , of course , this is highly agreeable to us , as I understand it to be to you . Of course , you are counting on General Sawyer and Mr. Christian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will be glad to have Brooks come along , if it is possible to take care of him . He can adjust himself to any arrangement , either on or off the boat , which is necessary . I think I ought to tell you about one party who I think would like an invitation . At one time his inclusion in the party was discussed . I refer to Secretary Weeks . Nothing has been said to him , however , and the extension of an invitation will be wholly left to your wishes in the matter . Mrs. Harding wanted me to write about a matter that she is deeply interested in . She wants the privilege of sending my horse and the one you placed at her disposal out to your Virginia farm for an early spring recuperation . She would like to send an attendant along , so that the horses might be properly housed at night and be given the out-of-door life during the day . Of course , I will be very glad to cover all expenses if your situation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not embarrass the management . Please let me know frankly concerning the matter . We are looking forward to the trip with the most delightful anticipation . Mrs. Harding is getting herself in form , so that she may fully enjoy it , and counts upon making a great improvement . She has been out-of-doors in the south grounds of the White House every day that weather permits and we are confident she is going to find great satisfaction in the trip . Please give my very best to Mrs. McLean , and be assured of my continued high regard , Very sincerely yours , WARDEN G. HARDING . I have a pencil-written scrap of paper that Warren Harding apparently tucked inside the envelope that carried the letter . This reads : " The Weeks matter is wholly up to you and Mrs. McLean . Of course , I am referring to him alone , since I understand the party is stag  --  outside of Evelyn ( sic ) to look after you , and the boss to keep me right . " That trip was much more pleasant than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dawes , Lasker and McLean were generally the foursome , as I recall it ; but sometimes George Christian played with them , and once or twice they took along some professional . What happened in the next few months to change our friend Warren Harding into a weary , heart-sick man ? I am sorry to report that an illness of my own here compels me to drop a stitch or two of yarn . In that same spring I was operated on . The Tragic Era Harry Daugherty was verging on a nervous breakdown about that time , and , everything considered , I suppose I missed a lot by being in seclusion . On May 19 , 1923 , Ned showed me a letter from Jess Smith , who was staying in Ohio . Smith reported , " I came to Columbus today to see Harry Daugherty and do a little shopping , I have not seen him yet , but will later in the day . He is making steady improvement and is less nervous , I think , and looks much better . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of callers , but evades most of them , tho they try to run him to death . He is taking things comparatively easy . " There is another paragraph I want to quote because Jess W. Smith really was a kindly fellow , whatever else he may have been . He wrote : " I miss seeing you Ned very much . You have always been so nice to me and I have such a deep affection for you that I really get homesick for you . I hope you are all right and still reducing your weight and going along good . I sincerely trust Mrs. McLean is also continuing to improve and will soon be able to be about . Kindly give her my regards , and also my regards to the children . I want you to know how much I appreciate your kindness to me in every way . I probably will never be able to repay you , but I am always willing and ready to do anything I can for you at any time . " Ten days after we had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one evening ; we were down at Leesburg on our 2600-acre farm . Ned answered . " It 's Jess Smith , " he told me . " He wants to know if he can come down here for three or four days . " " I do n't feel good , but tell him all right , " I said . " I will have my meals up in my room ; I should anyway , the way I feel . " Awhile later  --  about ten in the evening , I should say  --  the phone rang again . It was Jess Smith again , calling from his apartment in the Wardman Park . He told Ned a big storm was drenching Washington . He would be at the farm in the morning . At midnight or thereabouts the phone rang again . Ned was asleep . I in &; , S.1171.1K1J.RY EVENINU POST answered it . Jess Smith was on the wire again . " Hello , " I said . " How are you ? " " I am fine , but rather nervous . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with you ? " " Oh , I 'm just a little upset . Ned 's asleep , you say ? " " Is n't Mr. Daugherty with you ? " " No , the Chief sent for him to come to the White House . " " Who is with you ? " " Barnet Norton . " That was Senator Knox 's secretary . " Well , you get a little sleep now and you 'll feel better . " " I 'll be at the farm at seven , " he said . " You can stay as long as you like , " I told him . " I am so glad I can come , " he said . I went to sleep right after that and woke up about nine . My son Jock , who then was twelve , was standing wide-eyed beside my bed . " Jess Smith is dead , " he said . " He shot himself , the paper says . " Once when I talked with President Harding that year , I chided him about new traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations . My tutor in high politics was our friend , the Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , Col. George Harvey . " If you 're not careful , " I said , " you will swing us into the League , and then you wo n't get four more years in the White House . " I had spoken almost playfully , but his face tightened swiftly . " Evalyn , " he said , " I wish to God I could walk out and slam the door and never go into it again . " Few of our old crowd were going West with the Hardings on the Alaskan trip . General and Mrs. Sawyer were going ; also George Christian and his wife , Speaker Gillett and Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm Jennings . Most of the others were rather less well known to us , such as Albert Fall 's successor as Secretary of the Interior , Doctor Work , and his wife , Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wallace and Secretary of Commerce and Mrs. Herbert Hoover . They were a Western crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that summer of 1923 that , although the Hardings urged us to go with them to Alaska , Doctor Finney told me he must forbid me making such a trip . We were at Bar Harbor when we got the first news that the President was ill . Then we heard that all he required was rest . As we were in receipt of frequent bulletins , relayed from the Washington Post , we were not worried and really supposed he was soon to be himself again . Consequently , the news that he was dead came as a clap of thunder . We hurried back to Washington , and I was with Mrs. Harding at the White House during those first oppressive hours in what no longer was her home . Right in the middle of the August night , at 1:30 a.m. , Mrs. Harding decided that she was lonesome for want of her husband 's companionship . Ho was downstairs in the East Room of the White House , in his coffin . I held her arm , soft and dropsical , as we descended the curving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . Through all that time I never saw her shed a tear . George Christian , with a grief almost as deep as hers , alertly watched for any sign of weakness , of collapse , but there was no sign of that . " Put back the casket lid , " she said to him , and he obeyed at once . In the nighttime what was no longer the President appeared quite alive ; rouge and lipstick touches that , in daylight , were ghastly , with a softer illumination made him seem almost himself . Then I began to shiver , because I heard Mrs. Harding talking to her husband . The heavy scent of flowers cloyed my nostrils as we stayed on and on and Mrs. Harding talked . A chair was placed for her and she sat down . " Warren , " she said , her face held close to his , " the trip has not hurt you one bit . " That poor thing kept right ? on talking as if she could not bear to hear the silence that would so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . " No one can hurt you now , Warren , " she said another time . - 17 White House Vigil That one remark helped me to understand how she was weaving strands of comforting philosophy out of grief . I know how she had worried lest some crank should do him harm , and I sometimes am conscious of a feeling of warmth when I think that my own dead are now beyond the reach of harm . Before we left , she looked about at all the flowers  --  the costly sheaves of roses , the wreaths and the usual collection  --  oversize , of course . Somewhere in those mounds she saw something that she wanted , and stooped down as if she were in a growing garden to pick it up  --  a small bouquet of country flowers , of daisies and nasturtiums . These she placed directly on the coffin when she had told George Christian to close the lid . It was three A.M. when we started back upstairs . Ned went out to Marion on the train with Mrs. Harding and the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . That same night the Coolidges came out to Friendship and brought the Stearnses along . We five had dinner ; that was arranged by Mr. Coolidge , because , I fancy , he was being too much hectored at the Hotel Willard . I looked at him that night and wondered at the swift change that had been wrought . When Mrs. Harding had supervised the packing of all their personal belongings , when she had burned a mound of souvenirs and papers , given his dog away and performed a lot of other chores of widowhood , she lifted up her chin in a characteristic gesture . Then she walked out of the White House and came to Friendship . I myself was making preparations to return to my children at Bar Harbor . Cicadas were singing with their wings as we walked beneath the trees that shade the lawn . " Now that it is all over , " she said , " I am beginning to feel it is for the best . I could not , could not wish him back to all that strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Marion . She was staying at Doctor Sawyer 's sanitarium . Most of the par tients were mental cases . Sawyer was the one who had been keeping her alive , but Sawyer by that time was dead . I persuaded her to come down to the private car in the railroad yard and have dinner with us . When she was leaving in the middle of the evening to drive back to the sanitarium farm , she spoke with finality . " I will never see you again . Good-by . " " Now , now , " I chided her . " You are going to get better and visit me , see all your friends in Washington . " " Evalyn , this is the end . " It was , indeed . With General Sawyer dead , her shield was down . She died November 21 , 1924 . A few months after he testified in the Fall case , Ned hired a new editor for the Washington Post . He did it in the kind of mood that would send me forth to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $75,000 a year was George Harvey , who was giving up his post as ambassador to England . I wrote the agreement they each signed one night at Friendship on a sheet of my monogrammed letter paper . Harvey was a fascinating character ; to have him at work for one was something like having a tiger as a pet , a most flattering arrangement while the tiger likes his keeper . Once the hating mechanism of George Harvey got in motion , it never seemed to stop , but he was to the McLeans the warmest kind of friend . I think it was in the summer of 1924 that George Harvey joined us at Bar Harbor , his brow wrinkled over the problem of producing an acceptable 1924 campaign slogan for the Republican Party . One night on our porch he burst out , " Evalyn , I 've got it . " " You 've got . what ? " " The campaign slogan . Listen ! " " I 'm listening . " " Coolidge or chaos . " .11 Bond With the Coolidges Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of a week of cerebration by Harvey , who so often said smarter things on the spur of the moment . Sometimes , in the intervening years , as , in the role of client , I have sat across an office table and watched the calm , strong face of John W. Davis , I have wondered at the impudence of suggesting to the nation that his name could be a synonym for chaos . However , in 1924 I was for Coolidge , and if he were alive today , I think I 'd be a partisan of Coolidge still . Before we left for Palm Beach , I had a sweet note from Grace Coolidge , written on Christmas Day , thanking me for a fan that I had sent to her . They were to have four years more in the White House , but I could tell how the time would be flavored for her as I read , " I hope you will all have a merry , merry Christmas , and in your family circle I know you count , as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With my love , Grace Coolidge . " The only favor I ever asked of President Coolidge was to have Mrs. Edward Hutton presented at court in London , I had not seen Mrs. Hutton in a great many years , until we encountered each other at Palm Beach , and she reminded me that she was a boarder at the Mt . Vernon Seminary when I was a day pupil . That had been when she was Miss Post , of Battle Creek . She had been married , divorced and married a second time since then . We became very friendly in Florida . One day she came up and said , " Evalyn , I want so much to be presented at court , on account of my daughter . " The next time I saw President . Coolidge I asked him , and lie agreed to fix it . Then it developed that Airs . Hutton and her daughter wished to be presented at the same time . A bit later , Everett Sanders wrote a letter to Ned saying : " I am quoting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London : " ' In regard to the presentation of Mrs. Hutton and Miss Hutton net year , I am bound to tell you that we have been compelled to establish a definite rule that only one member of a family can be presented . There are , as you know , scores of applications embracing requests from mother and daughter . The number , however , that we are permitted to present is so limited that we have found it necessary to establish the rule just mentioned . The rule , of course , can be broken , and if the matter is of enough importance , it will be broken . But in view of our practice , I wish you would let me know , when I am in Washington , whether so marked an exception should , in the case of the Huttons , be made . My only fear is that if we make one exception , the pressure next year for many more will be pretty severe , which would result in practically cutting the presentation list ? in half . ' " In view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be satisfactory if we advise him to arrange for the presentation of the daughter alone . Please let me know . " Minnie Lee Duke was offering me 100 to 1 that the thing could not be done , but I was determined . 1 wheedled and pulled strings until at last Ned got an angry message from President Coolidge , the essence of which was , " I wish she " meaning me " would not annoy me . We are doing everything we can . " However , in 1928 Mrs. Hutton and Miss Hutton were presented . One night at . the I Street house Mr. Coolidge spoke to me in an undertone , saying , " There 's a lady here who is going to lose five dollars . " " Whom do you mean ? " I asked . " And how ? " He told me , and then he said , " I heard her bet some friend five dollars that she could get me to talk . Well , I 'm not going to open my lips all evening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady would chatter at . him archly , then fire a question , and then retreat before his grunt . Sometimes he nodded , sometimes he shook his head , but he did not talk . Contrary to the legend , however , usually Mr. Coolidge really liked to talk . The Riddle of a Phrase I never have figured out why he did not stand for re-election . When he came back from his trip to the Black Hills in 1927 , I went to the White House for dinner and chided him at my first opportunity for having said , " I do not choose to run . " After my usual habit of saying what is in my mind , I said to him , " It was a foolish statement , because we need you here in Washington . I hear people saying it 's because you 're sick . " I saw the muscles of his face grow taut , which was his common reaction to annoyance , and he fairly snapped at me , " That 's absurd . I am not sick at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How strange it is that with all my money and all of Ned 's , we could not fix our own lives . I think they were spoiled for us when we were little . His mother , and his father , too , believed that the way to make him happy was to give him what he wanted . They never gave him any taste of discipline . We went apart for keeps in 1928 . I went . back to him one time when he was ill , but just to nurse him . There is a lesson in all this , I rather fancy , for those persons who suppose that life would be entirely smooth if only they had money . Well , we had money ! Why , in a single year Ned 's income , at its peak , rose above $800,000 . He spent it all , and more ; and I spent all of my income , and more ; and yet , what did we buy except the stresses that . broke up our home ? Lest anyone should think that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of that rupture , I want to set clown here a poignant . line Ned wrote , from some place far away , to our young daughter : " I hope my darling girl is happy and that you never in your life he lonesome . " Unhappily , a broken family always goes on being lonesome . The Lindbergh Tragedy My own system of living finally began to undergo a change . I was not poor , of course , but I was no longer spending at . the rate I like to spend . One day when I was blue from all the trouble of making million-dollar ends meet , I remembered my old prescription for that state of mind , went to New York and asked Cartier to show me something fine . He then dazzled me with a ruby-and-diamond bracelet , one that owed its presence there to the depression . " That principal diamond , " said Cartier , " was placed in our hands by a well-known family that owned it , but with the condition that their name would not be revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . It is 15.46 carats . There are sixteen rubies and sixteen other diamonds . " Cartier held it up before my eyes , and I could only utter just one question , " How much ? " He told me $135,000 . I thought it over carefully for about a day , and then I sent him an offer of $50,000 cash and the balance to he paid in monthly installments over two years . Cartier telegraphed me " yes . " That is the way I always get into trouble when I have some money in my hands . I seem not to be able to do otherwise than spend it . However , there is no use in anyone chiding me for loving jewels . I can not help it if I have a passion for them . They swell my ego tightly , make me feel comfortable , and even happy . The truth is , when I neglect to wear jewels , astute members of my family call in doctors , because it is a sign I 'm becoming W. My mother died on February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , in trust , to go outright at my death to my children . So 2020 Massachusetts Avenue became mine , likewise other real estate , more bonds and varied possessions , along with that fresh sorrow . It was while my grief was sharpest that the Lindbergh baby was kidnaped from its crib in the parents ' isolated house in New Jersey . Why should I have tried to get that baby hack to its mother ? Well , for one thing , I had lived more than a score of years haunted daily by the fear of just what had happened to the Lindberghs . So many people were wishing they might save the baby and revenge the crime that I wonder why so many persons now ask me what prompted me to involve myself in the hunt . It should he obvious , I think , that / tried to do what millions wished that they might try to do . In my case , the wish was harnessed , just as a carriage , to my money . I wished , and presto , things began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1932 , I sent for Gaston B. Means . He came at half-past eight .. He stood before me in my drawing room , a fat and deeply dimpled scoundrel who was , I thought , precisely what I needed as an instrument to get in touch with the kidnapers . I had no illusions about Means except that I supposed that the chance to act as go-between in the ransoming of the Lindbergh baby would seem a bigger prize to him than any other chance he might discern in his dealings with me . I wanted Means for precisely what he was  --  for the lack of straightness in his smartness . I still think that Means was just the sort of man I wanted , even though he failed me . The Lindberghs themselves had adopted a similar notion  --  that the way to make a contact with the underworld is through someone linked with it . Means told me plausibly enough to convince me that he wanted nothing more than to reestablish himself for the sake of his own son and Mrs. Means . He hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restore himself to favor . With just one deed he could remake his world . " Means , " I asked him , " do you know where the Lindbergh baby is ? " " I do , " he said , and then proceeded to tell me a highly colored yarn that was easy to believe . Means had been sent to Atlanta by the Federal Government for taking bribes from men engaged in the illicit liquor traffic , and for weeks after the Lindbergh baby was stolen , the theory common to most police officials , and which was held by the Lindberghs and the Morrow family , was that bootleg criminals were the kidnapers . After some days , Means told me the kidnapers wanted $100,000 ransom . I put a short-term mortgage on the Oxford block to raise that money , and then gave the $100,000 to Gaston Means . A foolish thing to do ? I was as wild to get back the child as if it were mine ; and twice Colonel Lindbergh acted on a hope no vainer than my own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kidnapers Night after night I waited out at Fairview , outside of Washington . That had been my mother 's home . At the time I tell about , the house was tightly shuttered , the graveled drives neglected and in the gardens weeds were showing . This estate that was now among my possessions had been chosen by Means , from a list of suggested places , as the ideal rendezvous where we should meet the kidnapers and get the Lindbergh baby back . Each night I waited there and through the darkness tried to see along the paths my mother 's feet had made . Each dawn was just another disappointment , but with sunrise hope would grow again . I would think how fine it was that I should be engaged in something really useful in the world . In my Irish blood , that Tom Walsh gave me before he had a bit of gold , there was a comPldsinn pumped from my heart making me undertake that quest . I may spring from peasant stock , but that was a stirring , after years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel no chagrin whatever for having failed in an impossible undertaking . I did my best , paid out good money and wanted no reward except a glow of satisfaction that I hoped to experience in my heart . Well , Means had the cash , but there was no baby . This fellow Means was kept informed , of course , by reading all the newspapers , but thanks to his understanding of the half-world of crime , he could interpret what he read in such a manner as to make it seem to me that some of the things that happened , he had predicted would occur . When March was two-thirds gone , I gave him another $4000 for expenses , and agreed to go to the house at Aiken , South Carolina , that I had leased for the season while my son , Edward , Jr. , was down there in school . Means said that would be a first-rate place for the meeting with the crooks . Later , Means persuaded me that the criminals were ready to play fair with me at El Paso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking with me my trained nurse . In El Paso I registered in the hotel as Mrs. Lane , and each instant I kept in sight of the nurse and my maid . I was growing more and more suspicious of everything Means told me , and yet , the baby still was missing . Means swore that the criminals were close at hand , ready to deliver the child to me , now that they could so easily cross the international line and be fairly safe from capture . Then , a few hours later , Means came to explain to me that the kidnapers were already across the line , but would not give up the baby except in Mexico . I knew as plainly then as if a rattlesnake had buzzed its tail that I was in mortal danger . However , I instructed the nurse to stay behind to get the child , if possible , and then I started back to Washington . The Means Hoax It was after these adventures that Colonel Lindbergh , in New Jersey , identified the remains of a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Means ' yarns and explanations would fill endless pages . His final statement was that he had permitted some associates to take the $100,000 to be used in a whisky deal in which they expected to double the amount within the space of a few days . Well , after that I had Means and his confederate , a man named Whitaker , arrested . I testified against them , and Mr. Means was given twenty years ; at his age , I think that means life . I am sorry that I failed , that I was tricked ; but I shall always be glad that in my heart there was something that compelled me to try my best to take part in the effort to ransom the Lindbergh baby . I came to realize that it was high time that the family of Tom Walsh went back to work . How shall a woman in my fix train her youngsters to become useful members of society rather than leisured playmates of society ? Well , I turned on discipline as water from a faucet . My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says now sometimes that I am too strict with mine . Jock , my elder son , at the age of eighteen , went to work in Cincinnati in the counting room of the Enquirer , the newspaper his great-grandfather founded . Jock started at the bottom . He was paid fifteen dollars a week , on which he lived , in a boarding houie , until he had earned a promotion . A bit later there will be a job for Ned . I have every reason to believe that my sons and daughter will inherit wealth . The point is that I have learned that with the riches one inherits obligations . I would not undertake to say how great a change has been worked in me . However , in the spring of 1935 I went to dinner at the home of Senator and Mrs. Hiram Johnson . In Washington we always call her " boss . " Senator and Mrs. Key Pittman were there ; just a few others . As I came in , Attorney General Cummings leaned toward Hiram Johnson 's ear to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat next to Mr. Cummings and expressed surprise that he had failed to recognize me . " But there is something different about you , Mrs. McLean , " he said . " Something I ca n't quite define . " " Mr. Attorney General , " I replied , " as your department contains all the 0-men , you are supposed to be the nation 's greatest sleuth . And you tell me you ca n't figure out the change in me ? " " I really ca n't , " he said , " and I 'm amazed . " " Mr. Attorney General , the last time you saw me , my hair was jet black , and now it 's pink . " Even so , I dare to tell myself sometimes that there really has been a change and that it goes far deeper than hair dye . I suppose that many have read this with envy , some with amazement , others with anger , that money , so powerful in this world , so desperately necessitous in their own households at times , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money is power  --  power for good , power for evil , accordingly as it is used . Power is a test  --  the test  --  of character . I want pity from no one , do not want to seem preachy or sorry for myself , but , as any woman , I should like to be understood a little . Unless you have been put to the test , do n't be too sure that you would have made a better mark than I have . He jests at scars who never felt a wound . If Ned McLean and I had been horn into average-income families and normal environments , given just what we were born with , we probably would have been average citizens today , leading normal lives , with Normal faults and virtues , reading this story with the same emotions you have felt . Character or environment ? The world never has settled that argument . I think we each had enough character to have met the negative tests of such an environment . The very circumstances of normal life encourage self-discipline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tied up with money or the lack of it , but only the rich may be reckless , foolish , ignorant , and snap their fingers at the consequences . If you are not rich , the piper is at the door with his bill in the morning . The rich can defer their payments ; they may easily delude themselves that they are not paying at all . I said that . money is power . You may believe that you know this quite as well as I. That I doubt . It is not something you can know by hearsay . Money and electricity are much alike . Both are stored energy . Living amid electricity , using it constantly , you take its presence and its utility for granted . Treated with respect , it is constructive , tireless . Treated with disrespect , it is destructive , vicious . It will light your way , pull a twelve-car train from Washington to New York in a bit more than four hours , kill you or burn your house alike . Electricity is insulated , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who make money rarely are reckless with it . They know its values from having made it . They know that it takes at least as much gumption to keep it , to use it wisely , as it does to create it in the first place . If they misuse it badly now and then , it is in the full knowledge of their folly and with a reservation not to make a habit of it . Yet they assume often in their children that this is sense as plain as that a hot stove burns and pins stick . What I Have Learned From Life They bring their children up surrounded by wires charged with the high voltages of wealth , thinly insulated with " Naughty ! Naughty ! " commands . If they are generous of heart , they will want to share the bounties of wealth with their own . If it is easier for any parent to say " yes " than " no , " how much easier for those whose yes involves no sacrifice , or inconvenience even ? If they have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . In this eagerness to give their children the things they themselves did not have as children , to save these children from what they themselves did have , they innocently deny their sons and daughters the very incentives , the aids to character and ambition which impelled their own successes . This is instinct in most parents , rich , poor , or in between . You may see the impulse operating under nearly any roof , but those who do not have money are in little danger of softening their children with money . There is nothing noble or virtuous , as such , about poverty and discomfort . If a man in his own youth broke the ice in the water pitcher of a winter morning , it is n't necessary to deny his son a radiator . If a woman walked barefoot to a dance , carrying her shoes , it wo n't corrupt her daughter to ride in a ear or to own five pairs of shoes . But if it was good for the man to earn his own spending money as a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enough for the father ; five dollars may not be enough for the son . Times change , and the value of money , but boys and girls and first principles do n't . Or if parents are mean-spirited  --  I have seen them dangle riches tanta lizingly before adolescents , not to discipline them to moderation , but teasing them with the scraps of wealth . If they have pride in their own achievements , they may easily communicate the pride , without the achievements , to their sons and daughters . Surely the greatest responsibility that money brings is the responsibility to keep it from distorting your children 's lives . Yes , money was our devil , but it was not money 's fault . I can hear my father talking now of " clean money . " His came directly from the earth , not from other men , whether fairly or unfairly . He took pride in that . A generous man and one who liked people , he taught me that there was no true generosity in giving money if the giver has much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , it cost me nothing ; therefore meant nothing . This I have tried to practice , hope to practice more . That he did not teach me more , I can not find it in my heart to reproach his memory . He had not , after all , experienced the evil side of money . He knew little of weakness . A strong character himself , it would have been natural for him to take for granted the strength of his children , to fail to realize the different circumstances of money earned and money inherited . It is myself I reproach ; most of all , because he would be disappointed in me . I best can make amends by teaching my children what I had to learn the hard way , and late . I am teaching them ; be sure of that . As for myself , I am pretty nearly broke now . I hope my acquaintances  --  I won't. say friends  --  are satisfied . The Hope diamond and every other jewel I have , have been in and out of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet square where the plaster has fallen from the ceiling of my bedroom at Friendship . Its repair is indefinite and I am thinking of hanging pink ruffles around it . With care , if times improve , there will be enough salvage from the two estates to provide what still will be a fortune for each child . I think they will give a better account of their stewardships than their father and mother have . It wo n't be for lack of a bad example or for ignorance of that example if they do not .
