Is a hundred years since Alexis de Tocqueville came on pilgrimage to the United States to observe the workings of that political system which , for good or ill , he deemed to be the destiny of the Western world . Nearly a century later another Frenchman came on a similar errand , but this time his eyes were set on economic , not on political activities , on Detroit , not on Washington , and M. Siegfried offered the Western world the choice between Ford and Gandhi . It is only a few years since that choice was offered and , in those few years how great a change ! To a foreigner who , like the writer of these notes , left the United States in the days of Calvin Coolidge ( gloriously reigning ) and returned to find Franklin D. Roosevelt boldly ruling , the shuck can be compared to the first emergence from an air-conditioned car into a railroad station in a heat wave . This is , if not a new world , a new climate I Gone are the days when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that distant age the United States was the hope of the capitalist world . Theorists might sneer , economists prophesy doom , moralists lament the dangers of luxury , and the natural " knocker " point out such blots on the sun of prosperity as a West Virginia coal field or a New England mill town enjoying their own private depressions ; but the boosters had it . If this was not the best of all possiblesystems , it was on the way to becoming the best ? and it had no competitors in the brilliance of its achievements or of its prospects . The United States was : The " golden expectations " were more material than those which delighted Wordsworth in the revolutionary Paris of his hope and love . " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity " sound better than " a car in every garage ( or even than two cars in every garage ) for every family , " but to a world bled almost to death for fine phrases there seemed something reasonable and practicable in the promise of American life . The machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business success , all things would be added to the fortunate citizens of the United States . They could buy from Europe books and pictures , artists and musicians , scholars and sophists . Here was the new Rome with all the plunder of the world pouring in on it . Those days are , for the moment , gone . It is not my intention to dwell on the inconvenient results of the change for Europe , especially for parasitic Europe , on the now empty fashionable restaurants and hotels where once Americans thronged to see the elite of a decadent continent do their stuff ; on the sad fate of popular authors who have now to rely on the cold appreciation of their countrymen , instead of on the generosity of an American public ready to take European geese for swans . Far more important and far more striking is the change within America , the crisis of faith that has come upon a nation optimistic beyond the dreams of Candide and on a class in that nation that has not , for two generations , had to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the rest of the American people . For what it is worth , I give my impression of this crisis of faith , of this sudden doubt of the American business man , doubt in his own future and in the future of the system to which he gave such a full measure of devotion . Some American business men are beginning to ask themselves the question , " Can the good old days ever return ; are we attributing to politics , to the President , to inflation or fears of inflation , to labor troubles , difficulties that arc really inherent in the situation ? Have we overplayed our hand so badly that no one , not even our old reliable partner , the Republican party , can take us out ? Is it a case of paradise lost , not merely of paradise mislaid ? " That such doubts can find lodging in the minds of men who are still on the winning side in the economic game , men whose financial position has suffered only to the extent that they can not now keep their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder , have to ask their wives to be content with a Buick instead of a second Lincoln , is ominous indeed ; for ruling classes that have lost faith in themselves seldom stay ruling classes long . It is true that the loss of faith is not of the kind that weakened the dominant classes in France and Russia before the revolutions in those countries . A French ? migr ? noted that Coblenz in 1793 was full of noblerefugees who a few years before had quarreled with their notaries over the insistence of the men of law on describing their employers in deeds as " high and mighty lords . " All the revolutionary parties in imperial Russia had friends of great position and wealth ; even the Bolsheviks had an " angel . " The American business man , so far as I have been able to judge , is not having his morale weakened by any sentimental or intellectual sympathy with his enemies and critics . He is still convinced that he more than earns his keep in the economy of society , that his opinion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not the only , by far the most important opinion for any rational government to listen to . He believes , as firmly as did Mr. Coolidge , that the business of the United States is business , consequently that any government that goes against the mass of business opinion is sinning against the light . But he does not believe any longer , or at least , he does not believe it with the simple animal faith of a few years back , that business leadership is sure to be on and up . That the country will be ruined if it does not follow " business " leadership is still an axiom , but he fears that leadership may be forced to change its old marching orders , to order a retreat , instead of that headlong pursuit of happiness in terms of wealth and production which has been the battle doctrine of the high command for two generations . American business men , in numbers big enough to be significant , are beginning to sell America short . " There are ten million superfluous people in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do is to put them on subsistence farms , take them out of our calculations altogether , and get the rest of the country that is really fit to keep itself in an ordinary way on its feet . Relief is a mistake , for there will never be a place for these people , working in industry . The machine has superseded them and will supersede more of them . " " This city has stopped growing , it will never get any bigger , the best we can hope to do is to slow down its decay , and we ca n't do that if labor troubles keep on recurring . We find it hard enough to keep afloat as it is . " " This land should never have been occupied , it will have to go back to prairie , the people on it will have to go back to the East or to the towns . " " What 's the use of talking of international trade ? It 's going to shrink and we wo n't get a share of what 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from men in many lines of business and in many parts of the country ( I did not visit the Far West and the South ) . A Rip Van Winkle , going back to Russia or Turkey after twenty years ' sleep and talking of the Tzar or the Padishah , of the Bible or the Koran , would hardly be more surprised than I was . I remembered the scorn with which my diffident suggestions that the boom might not last forever , that the " secret of high wages " was a good deal of a secret still , that perhaps all the business in South America and China would not fall to energetic drummers from Scranton , Pa. , and Dayton , Ohio , had been greeted in the past . The scepter of Western culture had definitely passed across the Atlantic , to a civilization that realized that business was business and that was unweakened by skepticism , undrained by war , unstrained by class conflict . For the moment that faith is weakened , if not gone ; that Paradise behind , not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands the archangel with the flaming sword of the under-consumption theory and the shield of technological unemployment . Technocracy may have been slain but its ghost still walks . The reluctant acceptance of a national necessity for cutting losses , not for a year or two , but as far ahead as man can usefully calculate , has its comic side , for it is a revenge of theory on practical men , on the men who kept " both feet on the ground , " who had no use for abstruse speculations , who kept economists as Roman senators kept Greek metaphysicians , because it was the respectable thing to do . Now when theory might do something to allay private fears and support public claims , the business man is unconscious of the aid it might give him and keeps together in his mind two incompatible beliefs : that American industry has passed its peak , and that in the struggle for the lessened assets of the national estate the American people can be induced to let the business man , his lawyers , his managers , his bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively as they had before , but a bigger share . For if there is going to be less to divide , only by increasing his share can the business man hope to continue to live in the style to which he has been accustomed ? and to which he still feels himself morally entitled . II The question of underconsumption , of technological unemployment , of the menace of the machine can not be discussed here and could not be discussed competently by me even if this were the place for it . But there are two points about it which the men of eminence who shared their doubts with me seemed to ignore . First of all , the necessary failure of modern industry to provide means whereby the consumer could buy the product of the machines is not a self-evident truth . It is doubted by many economists and by economists who approach the question from very different angles . Even very radical economists , men who harbor PARADISE LOST ? OR MISLAID ? the most subversive views , men whose attitude to life and society almost justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are not necessarily believers in the existence of this dilemma . There is a theoretical case against all these fears , a case which , given the willingness of the human mind to believe in good news , would certainly convince many of the alarmed business men , if they heard of it ? and if they realized the implications of their position . For , if the best that business , as a system of society , can offer the American people is a deliberate limitation of the powers of production , the exclusion of millions from a price economy to get production down to the assumed maximum level of consumption , the American people will not long endure business leadership . If business begins to hint that a part of the Garden of Eden will have to be railed off , that the whole complicated price structure can he kept going only by an ascetic refusal to use production to the full range of its possibilities , business has proclaimed its own abdication . For American business is not loved for itself , nor for the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see in it the promise of a " more abundant life , " and by more abundant life they mean more of this world 's goods . Any candidate or patty which promises two cars in every garage and can make itself believed will win triumphantly ; for I see no signs that this pessimism has gone very deep or that the resignation of business to less will have any result other than the rapid growth of a determination to try some system , any system , which promises advance . The alternative system may only promise paradise at the risk of falling off a precipice ; but the American spirit is still youthful enough to prefer a leap in the dark to a slow and ignominious retreat down hill . Put this way , the answer may seem easy enough ; few would-be leaders of the people , politically or economically , would dare to announce openly their doubts or fears . How can they hope to conceal them , how can they hope to be obeyed blindly , since few among them can hope that they will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes open while the Leonidases of the present ruling class return to Sparta to explain away the sad necessities of economic strategy ? The clue is in the words " ruling class " ; a ruling class , however great its skepticism , seldom or never carries it to the ultimate point of doubting its own place in the scheme of things . It may put away formal honors in a fit of good taste , it may develop radical views ; but there is the underlying assumption that the class , or the individual , will not really lose anything substantial . The young duke in Disraeli 's Lothair was a dreadful radical . Nothing in church or state was free from his iconoclastic zeal ? except dukes . " Dukes , " he said , " are a necessity . " American business has its full complement of dukes . The rosy illusions which make this world tolerable deserve kindly handling , since we all live by them ; but one of the commonest is so easily seen through ( in the forms that it takes in our neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it with a fair degree of candor . We all know the teacher , in school or college , who makes a fool of himself by an exaggerated sympathy with the young , who seeks to conceal the fact that he is older and wiser and more learned than his young charges ( sometimes he is more learned ) , who wants to be liked for himself , not respected for his office . This type of pedagogue is not more widespread than those who are his opposites in other professions , the pretty girl who wants to be admired " for herself , " the athlete who fondly believes his popularity will survive his legs , the class which believes that its power and prestige will survive the function or attributes which won the power and prestige . The sad fate of King Louis XVI is a case very much in point . He was the heir of a tradition , of a function , of psychological assets , all tied up together , none of which could survive the other . His family had been the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity ; the Capetians had been the more or less conscious allies of the French bourgeoisie in the liquidation of the feudal system . As long as they continued to fulfil that function or , at least , did not obviously neglect or refuse to fulfil it , the unbreakable loyalty of the French people to the House of France remained unbroken . To separate France from the dynasty , to conceive France as existing without the dynasty , was an effort of the imagination beyond the vast majority of Frenchmen even after the fall of the Bastille . It was , of course , quite beyond the imagination of the dynasty itself . Yet the impossible was achieved in a few years ; for the King and his brothers and their hangers-on convinced that part of the French people which mattered that the dynasty was falling down on the job , that the traditional function of the dynasty could no longer be fulfilled by it ? and , before that new conviction , the great tradition of a thousand years , a tradition far more deeply rooted , far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " withered away . In four years the French monarchy was dead and , though restored in the flesh , could never be restored in the spirit , not by the arms of Europe or the pen of Joseph de Maistre or of Charles Maurras . The parallel , I hope , is not very obscure . It is dangerously easy for the American business magnate to repose confidently on the traditional hostility of the American people to " socialism " and " radicalism , " to be sure that the United States will never follow the lead of politicians and , still less , of professors , against the will of its natural leaders , the rich . It is easy to be confident that the habit of command will tell , that the long tradition of success that inspired so many business victories both directly and under the political aspect of the system , through the Republican party , will not long be broken . The leaders of American business have , Iike Browning 's cardinal , seen four and twenty leaders of revolt ? and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily enraged sheep . The rules of the game make victory certain ? in the not very long run . The magnates may be right , but what are the rules ? The first and almost the last rule is that the rulers must deliver the goods , that they must share some of the winnings of the game with their clients , with the great mass of the American people , and that these winnings must be absolutely more than any rival system can plausibly promise . I have used the words " clients " advisedly , for the rulers of America have not the advantage of some of their European brethren , the advantage of a patina of age . After two or three generations in Europe the reverential mind of some of its peoples , of the English for instance , forgets the origin of wealth and admires it with a na ? ve disinterestedness for its own sake . The Russells , for instance , laid the basis of their fortunes by speculations in real estate , like the Astors ; but in a time not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Astor fortune they had merged themselves in the high and mystic fraternity of the English rich who had forgotten how they made their money ? and , more wonderful still , had managed to share their amnesia with the mass of the population . The Russells had tenants , men who were grateful to be allowed to live on the Russell lands , men who rejoiced , as befitted the kindly commons , in the glories of Woburn Abbey and Bedford House . The American rich have not been so lucky . The American does not admire wealth as such as does his more simpleminded English brother ; the Iong-lived sense of grievance that the Astor money comes from mere landowning , not from business activity , is proof enough of that . What the American admires in wealth is achievement , success in a game in which all are playing and whose rules are reasonably fair . He gets hurt if the prize is awarded to someone who has been too obviously lucky in the " seeding , " who has been passed into the final round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start ; but he resents the first more than the second , the easy triumphs of hereditary wealth , rather than the occasional hit below the belt of the self-made man . The admirers of the American rich have been not tenants , but clients , economic dependents who are not disposed to go farther in the way of devotion or loyalty than the economic bond suggests is advisable . It is the absence of the tenant attitude of mind that makes the country life of the American rich so empty of the solid spiritual satisfactions which their English brethren enjoy to the full . A successful English furniture dealer can buy more loyalty ( with the estate ) than could the whole House of Morgan , in their own country , at least . IH It might well seem to the casual observer of the public prints that there is something more reverent in the attitude of the average American to the American rich than this . Advertisers certainly think so , or else why spend so much money selling their products with the aid of more or less fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke Sorghum cigarettes because Mrs. Lowell van Pants ( who drinks her rum neat and never kicks her friends ) finds that they take the taste of hashish out of her mouth , show a true appreciation of aristocracy ? Do not those car advertisements , apparently the achievement of an out-of-work court flatterer , testify to a deeply rooted aristocratic tradition ? You know the kind of thing . The unnamed most ravishing debutante of Des Moines is advised to unbend so far as to ride in a car costing less than its weight in gold . The best rider to hounds in Hennepin County is requested to put what Shakespeare , in a slightly different context , called his " imperial scat " into something cheaper than a Rolls Royce . But even these simple appeals to snobbery have to sell the idea with an al t beyond that of the simple English " By Appointment to His Majesty , the King of Barataria . " In the main , the American rich are for use , not ornament , and if the selling talk is overdone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire disease , called by the famous social pathologist , Dr. F. Sullivan , " the tripes . " It may even induce it in the extreme form of " the gags " ( nausea pudica ) . The public is interested in the marriages of the rich ; they are dramatic , especially when the course of true love runs roughly , with accompanying public tantrums . It is also interested in the love life of film stars , of gangsters , and of wives ( or husbands ) who bump each other off , rather than offend convention by a divorce . It has not , I think , the simple reverence of the English mob which murmurs an ecstatic " coo " as the horselike daughter of a duke moves off to matrimony with an even more equine bridegroom . Mark Twain noted the difference when he told his story of his tactless surprise at the willingness of some English friends to stand in the rain to see a minor princess whom they had seen before . Anxious to let them down easily , he made the handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see General Grant , for a second time . The shocked horror with which his English friends received his comparison of General Grant with the Princess Hedwige of Hohenstiel-Schwangau , seventh cousin , thrice removed of the Good Queen , taught him a lesson . But how many Americans are not of Mark Twain 's opinion ? How many would dare admit to the simple superstitious snobbery of many English people ? How many Americans would wait to see the King of Italy rather than Mussolini ? John Jacob Astor rather than Max Baer or Albert Einstein ? People have talked as if young Mr. Astor 's marriage were an event in American history . It is a natural mistake , but a mistake nevertheless . A Rockefeller marriage , a Ford marriage , a Morgan marriage might well be ; for the Standard Oil Company , the Ford Motor Company , and the House of Morgan have been ( and still are ) great forces in the advance of American life . The controllers of these fortunes are very powerful as well as very rich ; great destinies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rich , but it can not make New York City grow or decline . They have not even the importance that comes to the English branch from owning The Times and The Observer . Americans admire their rich for the energies that made them rich . Theymay admire them for their splendor or extravagance ? and , I think , they do admire them for it more than they resent it . The poor , whatever may be the case of the middle-classes , may envy and resent riches , but they do not feel especially aggrieved that its owners have the time of their lives with it . Splendor is the only popular justification of a great fortune . But the great claim of the American rich to admiration , to trust , to obedience is their economic success in getting rich , in keeping rich , in getting richer . Their fellow-countrymen are clients , not feudal followers . The Roman dictator Sulla put horns of plenty on his coins to show he was favored of the gods and Rome through him . The American people are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good fortune of their betters as long as they share it . This client attitude is no doubt distressful to the would-be squires , but it has been a safety-valve of the utmost importance in the last few years ; for it has meant that the American people have been astonishingly tolerant of the sins of commission and of omission of their betters . They were all in the game together , and as long as the game was being played in the same spirit by all parties the disasters were suffered in common . The corresponding English ( or British ) classes would have been far more loyal and blindly admiring as long as the money lasted , but would have been ready to transfer their allegiance at the drop of the market . If , however , they themselves had been involved directly in the disasters that befell their betters their resentment would have been deep and long-lived . In my native city of Glasgow the older generation still refer to the " year the City Bank failed " ( 1878 ) as a grand climacteric of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bitter vicariously and think occasionally of the fraudulent directors doing time on the bleak breakwater of Peterhead with a satisfaction that is barely Christian . If that attitude is rare in America it is not merely because there are more recent bank failures to exhaust the store of gall that makes oppression bitter ; it is because the American is singularly tolerant of losses endured in the course of economic advance . When one considers the events of the last five years , and the revelations of the " goings-on " of the years before that , the lack of resentment which the visitor encounters is staggering . To contemplate in Cleveland the magnificent ruins of the Van Sweringen enterprises and to reflect on the losses that went to erect the buildings surpassing the marble and the gilded monuments of princes , and then to discover how little the collapse has affected the position of the too enterprising brothers , is to be enlightened on the American temper . a temper which the American rich seem in grave danger of misunderstanding . The Van Sweringens , no doubt , displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Trust Company , but they were builders . Their buildings may not only be losses to themselves , but a cause of losses to others ; but the buildings are there . They believed in the future of Cleveland , and for that much shall be forgiven them . A Cleveland woman who knew her own mind very decidedly , who had an acute memory of the troubles brought on her by the bank closing , of her inability to buy coal in semi-arctic weather , for instance , was still angry but her resentment was not directed against the Van Sweringens ; it was directed against another Cleveland magnate who plundered the bank without any worthwhile results in the way of steel and marble , and against mortgage-holders who were still insisting on their sixper cent after the dollar had been de-valued ! It is obvious that the point of view here displayed does not commend itself for clarity to the academic economist , but it is very widespread . In Minneapolis the Foshay tower , a fairly tall but not otherwise impressive building , still proudly hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some years in a federal prison . There is no widespread feeling that any grave injustice was done , but there are sober citizens who regret that the arrest was not put off until after the last corner of the building was completed ! In his own slightly irregular way , Mr. Foshay was a builder ; he did something . Iv Now important sections of the American rich , contemplating , with what seems to me excessively great apprehension , both the New Deal and its possible consequences , are in danger of misunderstanding the temper of the average American . I do not believe that he is as yet in the least revolutionary . If he does not shrink from some of the practical aspects of " Socialism , " he shrinks from the name ; he still associates it with famine and the nationalization of women . Strikers may , consciously or unconsciously , follow socialist or communist leaders , but they are very far from accepting the ideas which these leaders represent . The idea of a conscious rebuilding of society on a basis of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men seem absurd to an outside spectator who has had some slight acquaintance with a really disgruntled and skeptical proletariat . Whatever ravages communism may have made among the Inings of New York City , it has left the Elmers of the Middle West quite untouched , as untouched as Rousseau 's political doctrines left the petty bourgeois of the provincial towns and the peasants in the France of 1789 . But as there was more to Rousseau than the Social Contract , so there is more to Bolshevism than the dreary polemics of the New Masses or the Daily Worker . The eyes of the world , once turned to the Detroit assembly-line , are now turned to Moscow or Stalingrad . There , more and more simple souls are beginning to believe , the machine gets its chance , unhampered by the financial bonds that tie it down in capitalist countries . " We have got to get away from what Veblen called the vendibility standard , ? said the Middle-Western engineer to me , discussing an obviously " uneconomic proposition . " Veblen may be merely the Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they are widespread . " Of course there is plenty of work to do , but the big men in the profession are timid , they hate all new ideas , " so said the New York engineer . " The only building is government building , museums of all the styles , " said the architect , " and private building is no better ? look at Harvard , look at the banks : new ideas are barred . " " You ask why big business is so sore at the New Deal , " said the advertising man . " Because business is full of stuffed shirts at fifty thousand dollars a year that any shake-up will shake out . They 're hoping to keep their jobs by sulking . " If I were a rich American , I should fear the annoyance of the technicians more than anything else ; for their consciousness of social bonds with the owning class is the most formidable obstacle both to revolution and to a socialist remaking of society ? as the Russians have discovered . Yet men who should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will put before the technicians the dilemma of loyalty to their caste and loyalty totheir craft , Let them once suspect that what stands between them and the free and fruitful exercise of their profession is the American business man , and the struggle may become an earthquake . If the American business man got the loyalty of his employees it was because they were thought to be engaged in a common enterprise , the production of tangible wealth . That wealth is tangible goods , obviously " useful goods , " is still the simple faith of most Americans , and the business man , the rich business man , is not dialectician enough to infect the public mind with Austrian subtleties about value being a state of mind . An eminent , and far from obscurantist , corporation lawyer told me that he had been shocked to see in a State , supposedly suffering from severe agricultural depression , so many gas stations , hot-dog stands , movie houses , all " producing nothing . " The theory of value involved struck me as naive , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if it was once brought home to them that they had to do without gas stations , they would hardly be likely to respect the necessary existence of corporation lawyers ! For dukes , despite the simple belief of Disraeli 's hero , are no more a necessity than earls . If I were a wealthy American ( to return to this fantastic rhetorical device ) , I should be shy of the " Liberty League , " not because it attacks the President or the New Deal , not because there is not a reaction under way , but because , as the President pointed out with his usual political acuteness , " Wall Street greeted it as an answer to prayer . " It is not merely because it is a " rich man 's lobby " ? to quote the private remark of an eminent Republican who refused to join ? but because it might be represented as the lobby of one type of rich man . The emphasis on " property " conceived of as static , as an asset to be held on to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of the slave-holders and the brewers suggests how lightly Americans treat vested property rights which seem out of date . Citizens of New York might remember what happened to the just and legal rights of the patroons when the people decided that quit rents were a handicap to development . The corporation lawyers in the Liberty League , no matter how honorable and how eminent , should be kept in the background . Let Mr. Smith denounce the Administration not as an enemy of property , but as an obstacle to more and bigger Empire State Buildings . Let Mr. Irenee du Pont forget the bondholders , even the insurance policy holders , and promise more Duco and more Chevrolets . The American people may not be angry with Mr. Mitchell , but they have not forgotten him . They have not forgotten a system which demolished property rights with a speed and efficiency beyond the dreams of Dr. Wirth . The engraver who was induced by a high-pressure salesman to exchange his Liberty Loan for National City Bank stock is very forgiving about it , but he is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers to savings and investment involved in the government 's monetary policy . It is too late to lament this philosophical attitude , for had the American temper been less tolerant of unsuccessful experiment , some of the eminent bewailers of the approaching doom of all things would have learned that it is possible to throw more than ticker-tape out of Wall Street windows . Let them think of the bullet marks on the Place de la Concorde and reflect that if the Parisians did that for the trifling Stavisky affair , what would they have done for ? but fill in any name that occurs to you ! The answer to this dilemma may be non-existent . A good Marxian must believe that capitalism in its laterstages has to strangle production and that , sooner or later , the new methods of production will overthrow a society which tries to limit them on behalf of an outmoded property system . If that be so , we need not worry ; history will have its way . But rich Americans are not Marxians ; they are merely complacent leaders who believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them forward . The American people will become ungrateful for the blessings that have flown from the American variety of " private enterprise " just as soon as the flow begins visibly to diminish . The answer , if there is an answer , lies in Detroit not in New York . Justly or unjustly , Wall Street is now detested to a degree which is only faintly appreciated cast of the Hudson River . It is detested not merely by radicals , by farmers , by small business men , but by big business , by its satellite Wall Streets west of the Alleghenies . Any crusade back to normalcy which seems to come from lower Manhattan is doomed ; any crusade that seems chiefly designed to protect that type of property which economists call " titles to money " is doomed . The answer , if there is an answer , is in the Ford exhibit at the World 's Fair , in the legend running round the walls , assuring the American people that the machine and the abundance flowing from it are not enemies but friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is glad to be told it by the only rich man whose position in the heart of the people is unshaken . The new Ford is worth a hundred appeals to the Constitution and the spirit of Alexander Hamilton as a talking point for capitalism . The World 's Fair has another lesson , for in the Science Building , beside the ingenious illustration of the fourth dimension , is an equally ingenious series of refutations of perpetual-motion machines . More people look at the latter exhibit , and not all of them , I am pretty sure , are convinced that they ca n't do better ! That is the American spirit and on that the American rich should work . There is more life in capitalism , especially in America , than most of my radical friends believe ; but it is life on condition that the job of delivering the goods goes on and that the system does not become , or even appear to be , an obstacle to production . It will be fatal to go on believing in an abstract American devotion to " property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . The instinct that kept the Republican party from recognizing Russia ? absurd on the surface ? was perhaps based on a deep instinct that evil communications might corrupt American manners , that the Bolshevik and the American had too much in common to meet without mixing . If the American rich continue to trust in a habit of command , they may forget how awkward a habit of command becomes when the rank and file have lost the habit of obeying . The American rank and file may lose that habit , and the American ruling class , confident in the fidelity of its followers , may , like an Irish landlord confident in the loyalty of his tenantry , be awakened too late . The Irish landlord was sometimes aroused from his pleasant meditations by a dose of buckshot ; the American equivalent may not be dynamite , it may simply be a turn over to the machine , with probably too hasty a dismissal of the economic functions of the price system , even when worked from Wail Street . In any case , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide as fatal as an error in decision . All ruling systems make one last and , seemingly , avoidable error , and then all their good intentions and great achievements go for nothing .
