In the kingdom of copper there are two major provinces . One is the U. S. , bounded by a towering tariff wall ( 4 per lb . ) . The other is the world outside . There copper men have low production costs and , since Depression , usually sell their metal below the U. S. price , thus keeping most of U. S. copper inside its own stockade . Last week , for the first time since 1931 , foreign copper prices spurted past the U. S. quotation , rose to 9.95 per lb. , compared to the current domestic price of 9.75 . As the price climbed , the foreign copper cartel announced that next month they would increase production from 75 to 80% of capacity . Purpose : to give a war-scared European market all it wants , keep U. S. copper men from cashing in on the higher price abroad . <P> Like steel , copper booms only when general business booms . Its price is determined by what the traffic will bear . For some time the differential between U. S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. price has risen 1 on the strength of gradually increasing demand from home industry . That demand is currently giving U. S. copper men their best year since 1930 . Since the first of 1935 , foreign copper has risen nearly 3 primarily on the strength of Europe 's rearmament programs . <P> Although they have never succeeded in stabilizing copper prices over long periods copper men periodically play with " stabilization , " ' sporadically get into and out of international agreements to keep up prices by restricting production . <P> In 1929 , during a period of " stabilization , " copper men squeezed their price up to stratospheric levels of nearly 24 per lb . It was a cordial invitation to open every high-cost mine in the world . By 1933 , the U. S. price was down to less than 5 per lb. , foreign quotations to 4.40 . <P> Millstone that long ground down copper prices was excess metal that backed up on producers when Depression plugged sales . In 1933 , copper above ground in the U. S. bulked some 540,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to last the U. S. about two and a half years . Since then , U. S. copper men have cut excess stocks to some 218,000 tons , about three months ' supply at the present rate of consumption . <P> Even better off is foreign copper , among whose chief producers are the Congo , Rhodesia and Chile . Purchases by Europe are currently holding foreign demand nearly to the rate of 1935 , when the Continent consumed 1,215,000 tons , an all-time record . Chief U. S. copper companies to cash in on the foreign market are Anaconda and Kennecott , which operate big mines abroad . <P> For weeks , U. S. copper men have been arguing whether they should boost their price from 9.75 to 10 per lb . Fortnight ago , the idea got a stiff setback when potent Kennecott announced it had plenty to sell at the present price , promptly increased its output 25% rather than take a chance on having a runaway market at a higher price . Last week , U. S. copper men were still wary enough to make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although in the past such an action would have been almost automatic .
