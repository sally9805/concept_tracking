The Trail of the Lonesome Pine ( Paramount ) . In the first full-length Technicolor feature , Becky Sharp ( TIME , May 27 ) , the method of Color Director Robert Edmond Jones was to compose the chromatic values of each sequence as if it were a museum piece rather than an episode in a story . In The Trail of the Lonesome Pine , the first Technicolor feature made outdoors , Producer Walter Wanger and Director Henry Hathaway treat the medium with no such self-conscious awe . Sets , costumes and backgrounds are reproduced as far as possible in their natural hues . No effort is made to hypnotize the audience into the mood of the story by means of the Kalmus three-sided prism process . Except for a few superfluous shots of mist over the mountains , lakes reflecting the clouds at twilight and scrub pines shivering symbolically against the skyline , the cutting is handled much as it might have been if the picture had been made in black &; white . As a result , The Trail of the Lonesome Pine can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color in cinema but also as satisfactory entertainment . <P> It might have been even more satisfactory entertainment if Producer Wanger had selected , for the embodiment of his sane notions about color production , some vehicle more appropriate to the latest wrinkle in Hollywood ingenuity than John Fox Jr . ' s antiquated sermon about Kentucky hillbillies and their childish squabbles . Used as cinema by Cecil B. DeMille in 1915 and again in 1922 , The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was never a dramatic masterpiece and it has not improved with age . In this version , Fred MacMurray is the brash young engineer who , when he goes to the hills to mine coal , finds him self first obliged to patch up the enmities between the Falins and the Tollivers , who have been killing each other on sight for so many years that no one remembers how the trouble started . Sylvia Sidney is the pert mountain lass who turns hellcat when the Falins kill her baby brother . Henry Fonda is her cousin , whose conveniently heroic death neatly terminates both the feud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney . Most frequent shot : Fonda taking down his squirrel rifle to " go huntin ' . " <P> The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was made on location in the San Bernardino Range , 90 miles from Los Angeles . Difficulties inherent in all location work were augmented by the fact that Technicolor cameras weigh 200 lb. , three times as much as ordinary ones ; that closeups had to be made before 3 p. m. because after that fading light made the actors ' faces yellow , while longer range shots had to be made later in the afternoon ; that shooting was frequently interrupted because cold turned the actors ' noses red ; that deviations as slight as the flush on an actor 's face caused by eating a heavy lunch were ludicrously apparent on color film . The cast , which includes Fred Stone , Beulah Bondi , Fuzzy Knight and 6-year-old Spanky McFarland , used almost no makeup , built bonfires to keep themselves warmed to the right shade between shots .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
