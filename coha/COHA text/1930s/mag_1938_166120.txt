Down across the Wisconsin-Illinois border last week the spunky little Madison Capital Times ( circulation : 28,000 ) shouted a remarkable challenge to the Goliath-like Chicago Tribune ( circulation 900,000 ) . The challenge : Let Tribuneman Chesly Manly prove the truth of a certain statement in one of his recent dispatches from Washington , and the Capital Times would immediately pay $1,000 to any charity the Tribune might name . The statement in question : " La Follette 's so-called Civil Liberties Committee inquiry was conceived by John L. Lewis , dictator of the C. I. O. and political ally of Mr. Roosevelt , and used to intimidate , harass and smear employers opposed by the C. I. O. " Chicago is 144 miles from Madison . At week 's end the Tribune and its publisher . Robert R. ( " Freedom of the Press " ) McCormick. had given no sign of hearing or accepting the challenge .
