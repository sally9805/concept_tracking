txt While protests mounted yesterday against the plan of Park  --  Commissioner John E. Sheehy to construct an athletic field on the site of the old reservoir in Central Park ? protests based on the conviction that such use violated the fundamental purposes of the park and also incurred the danger of commercialization  --  Mr. Sheehy revealed that players using the baseball diamonds would be required to pay a fee . " I believe there is a nominal fee of $2 for playing baseball on city property and a fee of $4 or $5 is charged for the use of the tennis courts in Central Park , " Mr. Sheehy said in answer to questions as to whether players must pay . " The same fees , of course , will be charged for use of the grounds on the reservoir site . " Asked whether concessions such as for refreshment stands would be granted in connection with the opening of the athletic fields , Mr. Sheehy said that he had not yet considered that , inasmuch as he had been in office only two days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not prepared to say yet whether concessions will be granted , " said the commissioner , " but if any are I will be very careful to see that they are not objectionable . None will be admitted which could possibly cause any disturbances . Before deciding about this I will see how concessions are conducted elsewhere . " In the face of the objections of leaders in the Park Association , the Municipal Art Commission and other organizations behind the plan approved three years ago for the landscaping of the thirty-fouracre reservoir site into children 's playgrounds , a great lawn for play , pleasant knolls and groves and a sightly little lake , Mr. Sheehy stood firmly by his plan yesterday for installing athletic fields there . He insisted , however , that he intended this as only a temporary use . Landscaping Not Dropped . " I arn not in any way abandoning the original plan submitted by the landscape architects for beautifying the reservoir site , " said Mr. Sheehy . " It 's purely a matter of the money not being available . The reservoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and I am proceeding to give the public some benefit from it immediately , and at the minimum cost to the City of New York and to the pleasure of thousands of children . " I have not done away with the original plans . It would cost $700 , - 000 or $1,000,600 to carry them out , however , while it will cost almost nothing extra to turn the site into athletic fields . The athletic fields probably will remain until the condition of the money market makes the improvements planned possible . " The Park Commissioner added that he planned to have the athletic fields reserved tor small children in the morning , schoolboys in the afternoon and for older boys after 5 P. M. Mr. Sheehy evinced no concern at the contention of I. N. Phelps Stokes , president of the Municipal Art Commission , embodied in a letter to Mayor O'Brien yesterday , that the construction of the athletic fields would violate the city char- ter since the matter had not been referred to the Art Commission . " This is an emergency measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the courts would hold to the letter of the law . " Mr. Stokes would not make public the text of his letter and the Mayor said yesterday afternoon he had not yet received it . " I have n't conferred with Commissioner Sheehy on this matter yet , " said the Mayor , " but a fill is needed at the reservoir site to remove an eyesore . I think a way will be found to meet the views of everybody concerned  --  those who think this area should be devoted strictly to park use and those who favor playgrounds . " The Mayor would not say whether he favored the construction of baseball diamonds and tennis courts in this area . Anxiety was expressed yesterday , however , by persons interested in keeping the city 's parks free from encroachment , including veterans in many successful struggles against such encroachments in the past . The feeling was general among them that not only would the projected athletic fields mar the park and interfere with its proper use , but that they might be the entering wedge for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whittling away New York 's greatest and most beneficial open space . Many felt that even though it was sincerely intended to place the athletic fields there only temporarily , temporary expedients have a way of becoming permanent . There was little disposition to criticize Mr. Sheehy personally . The feeling was rather that he had not yet had sufficient time in office to familiarize himself with the purposes of the parks and that he had been badly advised . This feeling was expressed by William Bradford Roulstone , former president of the Central Park Association , long a defender of the park system . Says Sheehy Is Sincere . " There is no doubt that Commissioner Sheehy has conceived this project in all sincerity and he is taking hold of his new duties with a fine singleness of purpose , " said Mr. Roulstone . " I have a very strong feeling , however , that Mr. Sheehy will be making a grave mistake if he puts aside the plans of the landscape architects . " I believe that if Commissioner Sheehy had the money to use he would carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would better if the area were simply graded off and seeded in the meantime , so that it would be of use to , all classes of people . " Mr. Roulstone recalled how the landscape architects had contributed their plan , without cost , to make the reservoir site an integral part of the park and expressed his fear of what the projected athletic field would mean . " Playgrounds of this kind , " he said , " would not only not be a part of the park area but would constitute a great yellow smear of sand in the middle of it . This sand and dust would blow off these barren areas , and boys , who could play baseball elsewhere , would be very destructive of the park itself as they passed to and from the diamonds . " It has been said that the carrying out of this project would be the beginning of the end of Central Park . I hope this is not true , but it does have this element of truth : If one plot of ground is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement will extend to other areas in the interests of other groups and gradually the park would be whittled away for the benefit of individual groups . " Architects ' Group Worried . Alfred Geiffert Jr. , president of the New York Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects , who presented the plan for beautifying the reservoir site to the city , also attacked the athletic field proposal and said that the chapter stood ready at all times to cooperate with Mr. Sheehy in the best interests of the use of city land for the use and enjoyment of the people . The athletic field plan , he said , violated the use of Central Park in the " best interest of the people of all ages and interests . " In the plan presented by the landscape architects , he said , due consideration was given to all the elements involved , so that it would be in harmony with the surrounding park design and available for the use of all people of all ages and interests , although primarily a recreation area for the young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " precludes the construction of running tracks and baseball diamonds as being out of keeping , with the surrounding and devoting so large and important an area of the park to the use of a limited group , to the exclusion of the many as a general recreation area of beauty . From the point of beauty , nothing could be more unsightly than this area . ' Economically and in the best interest of the preservation of Central Park ' it would be better to leave this area alone until adequate funds are available to develop it properly . It it terribly depressing to see the constant misuse of land , particularly in a large city like ours , where the best of expert advice is available . " Old Park Issues Recalled . The past instances of attempted encroachment on Central Park , re- , called yesterday by the fight which has developed over the athletic field project , show many varied and invariably unsuccessful attempts to use the park grounds for other purposes than were intended when the park was created . The fight over the reservoir site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the controversy first arose over whether it should be used for athletic and playground purposes or landscaped and made into an integral part of the park under plans drawn ty the New York Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects . Prior to that the last widespread fight developed over the proposal in 1924 to use about six acres of park property for the erection of buildings to house an art and music centre . It was charged at the time that the park property , if the development were permitted , would be used to benefit the Metropolitan Opera Company . At that time so widespread a protest arose that the plan was finally abandoned . It was a complete victory for the individuals and civic organizations in New York who for years had been determined to hold the park inviolate from encroachments . It has been estimated that if the various proposals made for use of the park property had been permitted in the years since 1872 the park would have to be one-third greater than its 840 acres to hold them all . pi Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open cut be used through the park as a route for the- Washington Heights subway . Comparatively , the cut would have taken away a very small amount of acreage , compared to the proposal in 1921 to build a subsurface garage capable of holding 30,000 automobiles . The garage proposal was vetoed and the other withdrawn after considerable criticism . During 1910 and 1911 several attempts were made to place playgrounds and athletic fields in the park . Two of these , one for a group of baseball diamonds and sand piles and the other for free swimming pools , were defeated in the earlier year . The following year brought the largest crop of such proposals yet noted in a single year . One was for playgrounds in the upper section of the park ; one plan called for the straightening of all the park walks ; another called for recreation ground , and the fourth was for an outdoor theatre to hold 100,000 persons , covering fifteen acres . All the attempted encroachments were abandoned after sturdy opposition had been aroused . Perhaps the most embracing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when It was proposed that the park be cut up and made into building lots .
