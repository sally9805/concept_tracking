His Beatitude Miron Cristea , snowy-bearded Patriarch of Rumania 's 13,000,000 Orthodox Christians and present Premier of the Government of its 19,000,000 people , last August delivered himself of an interpretation of Christian doctrine . In an attack upon Rumanian Jews , front-paged in his nation 's press , he declared : " The duty of a Christian is to love himself first and to see that his needs are satisfied . Only then can he help his neighbor . . . . Why should we not get rid of these parasites Jews who suck Rumanian Christian blood ? It is logical and holy to react against them .
