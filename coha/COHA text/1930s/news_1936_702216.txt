txt If the fall of Madrid is as near and inevitable as is indicated by the dispatches , patriotism and elementary humanity would dictate the surrender of the city for the sake of the terrorized and helpless civil population . However strong the temptation of the defenders of the besieged capital to hold out to the last ditch , and the last life , at this stage no purpose can be served by prolonging the agony of non-combatants and turning a great capital into a shambles and a holocaust . But Spain is ruled today by implacable and insatiable passions . The last-minute appeals of the British and French Governments , urging the Madrid authorities to come to some terms with the Insurgents to spare the city and General FRANC() to curb the bombing , are as likely to fall on deaf ears as the earlier plea for exchange of hostages . The reckless determination to make the capital a battlefield is the more incomprehensible because its fall was already anticipated when President AZANA moved to Barcelona several weeks ago , and has been conceded since in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Catalonia . The loss of the capital does not necessarily mean the loss of the cause . Capitals have been occupied before without affecting the final outcome of a war . Philadelphia was in enemy hands during the American Revolution . The Capitol at Washington was burned by a landing party from the British fleet in 1814 . Germany was not saved because the Allies did not storm Berlin , nor would France have been lost if the Germans had occupied Paris , as they did in 1870 . Unhappily , the end of Spain 's ordeal will not come with the fall of any city . Even if the useless but inevitable struggle had not intensified class hatreds and the deep divisions between provinces , there is no visible solution of the deeper conflict of two wills , the more tragic because both , as SALVADOR DR MADARIAGA writes in The London Observer , are " inherently legitimate " and both . are so subdivided that they illustrate today the observation of STRABO that the Iberians would never " put their shields together " for the general good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside partisans to shame . This Spanish scholar and patriot respects and sympathizes with both sides , asking how the heroism and endurance of either can be dismissed with a contemptuous reference to " Red rabble " or " Rebel bullies . " He sadly admits that between two irreconcilable Spains such impartiality is the road to complete isolation for the Spaniard . " The Spanish tragedy would have oc " curred if neither LENIN nor Musso " LINT had existed , " he reminds us . " Its " forms are genuinely national * * " of that untranslatable residue of " Spanishness ' which knows neither . " fascism nor communism . Above " all , * * * the issue in Spain has " nothing to do with either democracy " or liberty . " It is clear that to both sides Madrid is a symbol , but a symbol too dearly served if , with Spain itself , its people and its treasures are destroyed as a whole burnt offering to a two-faced god .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
