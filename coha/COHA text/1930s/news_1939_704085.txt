txt The Supreme Court of the United States , so greatly altered during the regime of President Roosevelt , was the focus of a vivid clash today between conservatives and liberals at the American Bar Association convention . Recent constructions of the Constitution by the changed court brought denunciation on one side and warm praise on another . Frank J. Hogan , president of the A. B. A. , in his annual address viewed some of the new rulings as " the most devastating destruction of constitutional limitations upon Federal power , and the most unprecedented expansion of that power over the every-day affairs of individual citizens witnessed in a century and a half . " But Robert H. Jackson , New Deal Solicitor General and winner of many cases in the court , confidently remarked : " We are having something of a constitutional renaissance at this time  --  a rediscovery of . the Constitution . We are really back to the Constitution . " Would Rely on Congress Perhaps presaging a definite conservative campaign to prevent further constitutional changes by the highest court , Mr. Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power must be placed by the people in the legislative rather than in the judicial " branch of the National Government . " The guards have been let down , many of the constitutional limits have been obliterated , " he said to the 3,000 lawyers as he opened the bar 's sixty-second annual convention . " The people of the United States should know this and , so knowing , give increasing attention to the ability and stability , the courage and the independence of the men and women sent to the halls of Congress . There now rests America 's hopes . " The principles of the Constitution , Mr. Jackson insisted in his speech , never meant that the principles of the historic document should be applied in a " petty or parochial sense , " but in the light of changing conditions . Both addresses were based on the " important shifts in constitutional doctrine " forecast by Justice Frankfurter " after a reconstruction in the membership of the court " by President Roosevelt . In fact , Mr. Hogan used " important shifts " as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hearty endorsement of the court given by Mr. Jackson before the public utilities section . Arnold Talks on Trust Laws Thurman Arnold , the assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust prosecutions , addressed the real property section . He flew here from Washington yesterday . " Two things are necessary in enforcing the anti-trust laws , " he said in his address . " The public must be able to see the concrete results . The slogan of trust busting for the sake of trust busting as a moral issue will not work any longer . " Secondly , we must have an adequate force for the work . But trust busting should never be considered an end in itself . " With subsections meeting in many places , the principal bodies , the Assembly and House of Delegates , sat respectively in the San Francisco Opera House and the Veterans Building . Mayor Angelo Rossi welcomed the lawyers at the meeting of the assembly , while Heartley F. Peart , president of the San Francisco Bar Association , convulsed the audience by remarking : " The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , Max M. Gilford proposed to the assembly a study of the advisability of immediate abandonment of the parole system and substitution of specific sentences during which prisoners would be educated and rehabilitated . B. Bayard Strell of Newark , N. J. , urged in another resolution the establishment in Federal courts of public defenders for poor persons . This plan , which emanated from former Attorney General Homer Cummings , has been endorsed by the Judicial Conference and is approved by Attorney General Frank Murphy . Bills are pending in Congress . Pays Tribute to Dissenters The audience applauded when Mr. Hogan , in his annual address , paid high tribute to the consistent independence shown by the celebrated dissenting team of Justices and Butler in the Supreme Court . Noting that Justice Frankfurter said that dissents of old days had now become prevailing opinions , Mr. Hogan added : " Recognizing that many of the historic dissents of Holmes and Brandeis have now been transferred from the minority to the majority side of the court , the day must come when future chroniclers of our judicial history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Butler show in their courageous efforts to preserve landmarks of the law , will likewise record that their ringing dissents in this day became rules of decision in a later generation . " It was interesting to note that these two justices dissented in every one of a dozen celebrated decisions of the New Deal era , mentioned either by Mr. Hogan or Mr. Jackson . Dissects New Deal Decisions Carefully dissecting the changes in old principles by the Supreme Court , Mr. Hogan deplored the seven-to-one ruling whereby the salary of Federal Circuit Judge Woodrough was subjected to a Federal income tax . For seventy-seven years , he said , the pay of Federal jurists had been immune . Condemnation of the court for upsetting the ancient precedent of intergovernmental tax Immunity came next from Mr. Hogan . In 1937 , he remarked , the court would not let New York State tax the pay of Richard Reid Rogers , general counsel of the Panama Railroad Company . In the same year , it rejected a Federal Government effort to levy on the pay of William W. Brush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , these rulings were swept away by the court decision in the New York Port Authority case of 1938 , and the 1939 decision allowing New York State to tax the pay of James B. O'Keefe , attorney for the Home Owners Loan Corporation . The O'Keefe case , the A. B. A. president regretted , scrapped the seventy-year-old doctrine of Collector vs . Day . But Mr. Jackson commented with pleasure upon the dramatic quality of the upset of Collector vs . Day , a step which he had directly asked of the Supreme Court . Sees Taxation of Public Bonds Eventual Federal taxation of State , county and municipal bonds was seen by Mr. Hogan as a sequence of Supreme Court decisions . Former constructions of the interstate commerce clause had been thrown overboard by the high court , Mr. Hogan pointed out . In 1935 and 1936 , he recalled , the NRA , AAA and Guffey Coal Act were declared invaled , but in 1939 the newly ararnged court handed down decisions in the Consolidated Edison , Fainblattand other cases nullifying previous findings . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Mulford case , Mr. Hogan said , it merely approved " legislative juggling " of " marketing " for " production , " which it declined to sanction in the AAA ruling . " No lawyer can safely advise his client what the law is. , " Mr. Hogan said . " No business man or farmer can know if he is breaking the law , for if he follows established principles he is likely to be doing exactly that . What was a constitutional principle yesterday may be a discarded doctrine tomorrow , and all this in what has been so proudly proclaimed to be a government of laws and not of men . Why Written Document , He Asks " If the Constitution is to be construed to mean what the majority at any given period in history wish it to mean , why a written Constitution and deliberate processes of amendment ? " The new concept seems to be that it would be useless labor to seek to amend the Constitution in the method provided in the Constitution . Why amend when by adopt-1 ing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this day seems to be the theory and the practice . " For more than five generations the people of America have looked with unshaken and unshakable con-1 fidence upon American courts as temples of justice . But may there not arise fear that with a steadily growing disposition to adapt the law to changing social and economic conditions , these barriers erected by wisdom gathered from experience may next be weakened or destroyed ? " Can a government which may arbitrarily control the individual 's economic freedom be relied on permanently to keep safe his civil and political liberties ? " Reliance against the exercise of arbitrary power must be placed by the people henceforth in the legislative rather than in the judicial department of the national government . " Legislative independence and legislative wisdom are now America 's almost sole reliance for the continuance of that security of the blessing4 of liberty for which the Constitution was framed and the Government of the United States of America created . " " Rediscovery " . of the Constitution by the Supreme Court was compared by Solicitor General Jackson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus revealing the old master again to view . Constitutional law , he said , had become not the law " of " the Constitution , but the law " about " the Constitution . The body of the law " encrusted on the Constitution has been formidable , " Mr. Jackson rernarked . The due process clause of the Constitution , the Solicitor General said , had been distorted out of reason . He traced with satisfaction the court 's new view on this subject as well as on taxation and the construction of the commerce clause . ' There is nothing in the Constitution which provides that there shall be no power to regulate prices or wages , " he stated . " During the Revolution at least eight of the thirteen States fixed the prices of almost every commodity . Is it likely that when the fathers adopted the Fifth Amendment they meant to outlaw legislation which fixed wages or prices ? " Discussing taxation , Mr. Jackson said that after Collector v. Day , the court became " enmeshed in a network of decisions , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fashioning this network need not have been undertaken and that the true constitutional principle is that the employes and instrumentalities of one government have no immunity from the ordinary and non- discriminatory taxes of another government . " Before the tobacco , New York and Boston milk decisions , Mr. Jackson said , " a heavy gloss " had been laid by the Supreme Court on the provisions about commerce , but not until the atmosphere had cleared . Recalls Marshall 's Dictum " I think it is proper , " said the Solicitor General , " to emphasize that the powers of government conferred by the framers were meant to be construed and applied in no parochial or petty sense . They were meant to be applied with courage and vision , for as John Marshall remarked , it is a Constitution ' intended to endure for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs . ' Marshall warned of the danger that constitutional powers might be eroded by petty or scholastic interpretation . " At a meeting of the section on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City urged the United States Government to call an international conference to adopt The Hague codel or rules of aerial warfare , which , he said , appears to be the best plan to prevent the bombing of civilians and , concidently , protect all legitimate rights and aims of belligerents . " Experience in the Far East and Europe seems to have demonstrated that such specific rules supported by solemn agreements of all nations are necessary , " Mr. Ryan said . " The code is based fundamentally on the rule of international law since the dawn of civilization , condemning the slaughter , mutilation or terrorization of unarmed noncombatants and the wanton destruction or looting of their homes . " Robert Carey of Jersey City took active steps to force his fight against the bill of rights committee , which intervened in the Frank Hague case in the Supreme Court . He presented a resolution to the House of Delegates , noting that although the A. B. A. had refrained from intervention in such cases for sixty years , the committee filed briefs in the Hague case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered unwise , and he demanded that the A. B. A. and the committee refrain from intervention " in controversial and political problems . " There must be , he added in his resolution , a great conflict of opinion among members of the A. B. A. as to the policy . The Carey resolution will be discussed by a draft committee of the House of Delegates and reported favorably or otherwise . Meanwhile , Mr. Carey will have an opportunity to discuss the Hague intervention when the Bill of Rights committee reports to the Assembly on Wednesday . The author of the resolution , saying he is a political enemy of Mayor Hague , nevertheless fears that the Bill of Rights committee may be used by radicals in his State and elsewhere . President Hogan insists that the committee , his own creation , shall continue to intervene in behalf of civil liberties . The rights of neutrals in wartime were discussed by Howard S. Leroy of Washington ; international regulation of aviation in peace days , by Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt ; and the situation of real property in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sees Threat to Free Speech John W. Guider of Washington , reporting for the communications committee , said legislation was necessary to insure freedom of speech for broadcasters . There are limitations on this freedom of expression today , he said , and " the American conception of free speech should not depend upon the judgment or views of a small group of Federal administrators " but should be written into the Federal Communications Law . George R. Grant of Boston , Philip J. Wickser of Buffalo , Carl V. Essery of Detroit and G. D. Blount of Denver were elected to the board of governors . The new president of the Bar Association is slated to be Charles A. Beardsley of Oakland , Calif . The following are expected to continue in office : Thomas B. Gay of Richmond , Va. , chairman of the house of delegates ; John Voorhees of Sioux Falls , S. D. , treasurer , and Harry S. Knight of Sunbury , Mass. , secretary .                   @ @
