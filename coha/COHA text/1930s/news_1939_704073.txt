txt Some apparent progress in efforts to prevent an outbreak of hostilities over Danzig was recorded at the meeting of the British Cabinet today . but this improvement in one aspect of the European outlook was partly offset by renewed difficulties in negotiations both at Moscow and Tokyo . Not only has a genuinely firm agreement to resist any unilateral attempt to change the status of Danzig been reached . between the British , French . and Polish Governments , but there are indications that the seriousness of this resistance is beginning to be appreciated at Berlin . A leading German paper , the Bdrsen Zeitung , is reported here as admitting that " Germany does not doubt that Britain 's declared intention to go to war to fulfill her obligations is not bluff " To make doubly clear that no doubt remains , however , the British , French , and Polish Governments are understood to have agreed to make separate but parallel statements emphasizing this . Frank Statements Planned The Polish statement is expected to be made directly to the Danzig Senate ; the British declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons ; and the French is to be a speech by Premier Edouard Daladier or Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet . Alternatively the British and French messages may be sent to the German Government through diplomatic . channels . Reports from Berlin indicate that the Government of the Reich , if it sees no opportunity of breaking this solid front of resistance , will turn its attention further east and southeast . In addition to Germany 's efforts to win Bulgaria over to the Axis , negotiations are known to be still under way with Yugoslavia , and in German circles in London it is stated that an announcement may be expected soon of an arrangement under which Yugoslavia virtually goes over to the side of the Axis . This is not I confirmed in Balkan circles here , however . Gesture of Axis to Soviet There is also good reason to believe that the Axis is endeavoring to throw a monkey wrench into the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations . Considerable significane , : is attached here to an article in the Italian Gazzetta de Popolo , which said : " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to approach the nations of the Axis and those others who are attaching themselves ver closer to " the Axis . This may appear heresy , 1 but n is not . " From German sources it is I learned that Berlin has by no I means been idle while London and Paris have been negotiating with Moscow , and although it would undoubtedly be premature to speak of actual negotiations , the German Government is reliably understood to have suggested to ! the Soviets that if the negotiations I with the democracies broke down there might be room for an sir : rangement of some sort with the Axis . I The importance of putting an end to these tentative feelers between Berlin and Moscow is. of course , fully appreciated in London , and for , this reason the new difficulties which have arisen are considered specially unfortunate . Russia 's reply to the latest British proposals is termed " unacceptable " in official circles , and there is a tendency now more than at any time during the negotiations to ask whether Russia is pot putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paramount The present hitch is believed to be that the Soviets are unwilling to guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland , altheugh it was Russia which said that the small Baltic States were in exactly the same position for Russias as the Netherlands for England , and Switzerland for France . The British and French take the attitude that if this is so and there is to be full reciprocity , the English-French Guarantee for the Baltic must be counterbalanced by a Soviet guarantee for Switzerland and the Netherlands . Obstacles have also arisen in the Tokyo talks , where he Japanese are still insisting that the discussions must include wider issues instead of local questions confined to the Tientsin blockade . The accord between Italy and the Reich for transferring the former German population from South Tirol is interpreted here as an effort to strengthen the Axis by removing a possible cause of friction . Some doubts are expressed as to whether emigration on such a huge scale ? it would affect approximately 200,000 ? could be accomplished without the greatest hardship .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
