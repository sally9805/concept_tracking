After a brief political campaign Australians all over their vast continent hurried to the polls last week to elect a new Federal Parliament . Fighting hard for re-election was Prime Minister Joseph Aloysius Lyons and his coalition Cabinet . Trying to unseat him was Laborite John Curtin , ex-newspaperman and able orator . <P> With the Sino-Japanese war bursting over the horizon , there was just one issue : National Defense , and both parties agreed that Australia 's defenses needed patching . They split over method . Prime Minister Lyons took " Tune in with England " for his slogan , advocating closer co-operation with Britain in every field , that the British Navy in turn might be more useful for Australia 's protection . Laborite Curtin plumped for an increased Australian air force , then at the last moment pulled the one cracker of the campaign . Loudly he insisted that at the Imperial Conference in London last year Prime Minister Lyons had made secret agreement with the British War Office to conscript Australian troops in case Britain was dragged into a war . <P> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . The cracker last week was mostly fizzle however , Laborites gained a few seats over their previous rating , but Joe Lyons , safely tuned in with England , won the election , retained his Government and most of his previous majority .
