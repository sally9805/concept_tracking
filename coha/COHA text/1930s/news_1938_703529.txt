The group was headed by Gayer Dominick . The board at its meeting yesterday took no action on the report , passing it on to member for discussion . after which the committee will make a final report . To insure stricter control over non-member partners , the report contemplates classification of all non-member general partners as " allied members " who would be directly responsible to the Exchange and subject to Exchange control and discipline . Incorporation Long Discussed Permissive incorporation Of member firms has been under discussion for several years . but the subject was taken up more vigorously by the new Exchange management , Stricter disciplinary control of activities of non-member office partners of Stock Exchange firma , viewed as desirable for some time , was brought to the fore last January when the Conway committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made on the subject . Many of the larger firms have already indicated a favorable attitude toward such incorporation . Some of the advantages cited include continuity of operations of firms with retention of firm names well known to the public , availability of financial data through publication of statements at periodical intervals , less disturbance of a firm 's activities when one or more partners ( who would become stockholders ) withdraw from a firm , the question of taxes on profits which it is indicated would be less for an incorporated firm than the aggregate paid by the various partners under present practice on their share in the profits , and elimination of costly legal and acivertising expense now entailed when partners enter Withdraw from a firm with out of town branches ' where the firm must conform with various legal technicalities in the various states in which it has branches . Hearings on Proposals The proposals were submitted to the Board of Governors in the form of preliminary reports . On the basis of these reports and the recommendations in them , the ooard of governors has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of member firms will express their views on the proposals . It is expected that these hearings will begin within a few days . The report of the special committee on permissive Incorporation emphasized that corporations and their stockholders under the plan proposed would be subject to control as effective and complete as that now exercised by the Exchange over member firms . " The only control which the Exchange has today over its member Arms is its ability to end the privileges which those member firms have by reason of the membership by one or more partners , " the report states . " Precisely the same control could and would be maintained over registered corporations by the ability of the Exchange to end the privileges which the registered corporation has by reason of the membership of one or more of its executive officers who are common stockholders . " Direct Disciplinary Control The report on permissive incorporation endorses the proposal that direct disciplinary control over non-member partners of member firms be established by requiring all such non-member partners of member firms to be allied members of the Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and rules of the Exchange . If incorporation is to be permitted , the committee recommends that formation of member corporations be authorized only on the basis of their assembling and maintaining a larger capital than now required of member firms . In the proposed rules for adoption by the board of governors it is suggested that before any corporation commences business as a member corporation , it must have a paid ' capital of at least $250,000 and a paid-in capital surplus of not less than 20% or more than 50% of the capital . Other suggested rules governing member corporations which were proposed by the committee as a basis of discussion are : Every member corporation shall be organized as a business corporation under the laws of the state of New York . Stockholders Allied Members Every stockholder of a member corporation must at all times be a member or an allied member of the Exchange in good standing or a person approved by the committee on admissions . Every member corporation must at all times have among its stockholders one or more seat owners of the Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate at least 5% of the common stock of the corporation ; A member corporation may not have any more than 35 stockholders of all classes . Every director and every principle officer of the corporation must at all times be the owner in his own right of stock of the corporation having a par value of at least $10,000 ; The aggregate par value of the outstanding common stock shall be at least 55% of the aggregate par value of the outstanding stock of all classes ; A member corporation must file with the Exchange every six months a statement of condition in such form and detail as may be prescribed by the committee on member firms together with a list of the stockholders of the corporation ; A registered corporation would be required to enter into an agreement with the Exchange providing among other things that the business of the corporation shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the constitution and rules of the Exchange . Incorporation Committee The special committee on permissive incorporation is composed of Gayer Dominick , chairman , John Coleman , Richard Pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing the classification of all nonmember general partners as allied members , the Committee on Member Firms pointed out that the present control of the exchange over member firms has created difficulties and possible injustices . This is particularly true in cases in which disciplinary action has been taken by the Exchange against an Exchange member or members because of the action of their partners for which they themselves were not in fact entirely responsible and over which they could not have exercised full control . The proposal for allied memberships , it is pointed out , is in line with the suggestions of the Conway committee that a study be made of the advisability of bringing non-member partners more definitely within the disciplinary control of the Exchange .. Allied members would not be subject to initiation fee or dues and would have no interest in the property of the Exchange , no rights on the floor , no vote in connection with Exchange affairs , no right to reduced COMStliSmons on Exchange transactions and no rights in the Gratuity Fund .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
