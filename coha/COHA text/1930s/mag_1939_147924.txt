One of the most important and least noticed dispatches of the whole war in China last week hit the back pages of U. S. newspapers . It was merely a pair of sentences to the effect that Chinese troops had lured a Japanese army into perilous passes of the Chungtiao Mountains , at the foot of Shansi Province , rolled down on them from advantageous positions , and in four days slaughtered 2,000 men . Even allowing for exaggeration , this was a major Chinese victory . <P> Similar dispatches had previously trickled into similar oblivion : month ago , for instance , one described a guerrilla action near Great Wutai Shan , the sacred Buddhist mountain in Shansi-when Chinese caught an unsuspecting Japanese brigade and killed a full third of the force . <P> Rugged Shansi Province has for over two years been the key to the entire war in North China . Against it the Japanese have successively hurled three major campaigns and many little ones-all of which have blown up like light bulbs thrown against a wall . Because the province is as remote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its news has either been undiscovered or shoved out of sight . But last week there reached the U. S. the report of a young visitor to this major theatre of China 's struggle-first white man to visit parts of the province in 15 years . What he wrote was enough to make any parlor warrior drop his teacup . <P> Theodore H. White is a 24-year-old Harvard graduate with short legs , freckled face , cocky eyes , indomitable spirit , a compassion for suffering people , and a curiosity which would cost a cat all nine of its lives in no time . At Harvard he sold newspapers to keep himself in shirts , tooted a trumpet to keep himself in spirits , and did just enough studying to keep himself in the top 20 of his class of 1,000 . <P> When he graduated he was awarded the Sheldon Prize Fellowship-$1,500 for a year 's travel outside the U. S. He had looked forward to China : he had studied Chinese at Harvard , and he wanted to see what war is like . What he saw made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Government as a translator and writer in the Ministry of Information . Recently he realized the importance of Shansi Province in North China warfare , became impatient with meagre reports which were drifting out , and so decided to go and see for himself .
