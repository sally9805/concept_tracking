Foremost European exponent of the need for economic cooperation between nations in order to avoid another World War is young , vigorous Leopold III , Statesman-King of the Belgians . Possessed of the conviction that he ( since fate has made him a King ) and Belgium ( since she stands strategically between the European lineups ) have the responsibility of bringing about a permanent peace based on economic readjustments before it is too late , Leopold loses no opportunity to put his ideas across . <P> Year ago , after Britain and France had commissioned the then Premier of Belgium , scholarly Paul van Zeeland , to make his now dust-gathering study of the economic obstacles to world trade , pleased King Leopold wrote his Premier , suggested an international economic institute . <P> Last week the young monarch was in Paris , there attended the dedication of a monument to his father , the late King Albert .

Standing as she does at the crossroads of Europe , the mission of Belgium is to work for peace and mediation ... <P> " Let us raise ourselves above these envies and antagonisms ... Is not the best way of winning peace ... through the reciprocal confidence of nations and their active persevering collaboration ? " <P> In what his startled French listeners observed as a most advanced remark for a King to make , Leopold concluded : " The glory , like the enjoyment of the good things in this world that in the past belonged too exclusively to a favored few , has become and will become more and more the reward of those who serve humanity . " <P> After his speech all Paris buzzed with the possibility that if the Munich agreement of three weeks ago is to be followed up with an international conference , the initiative will probably come from Brussels rather than from Washington , whence it was first expected .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
