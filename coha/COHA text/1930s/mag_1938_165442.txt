When Congress passed the second Agricultural Adjustment Act last month , most complex of its many complexities appeared to be the means whereby marketing quotas were to be established by a nation-wide vote of farmers . Last week , first two referendums held under the new bill indicated that at least this part of its machinery was in good working order . Farmers in 20 States went to filling stations , schools , grange halls to cast ballots on whether or not the Department of Agriculture should impose quotas on 1938 crops of cotton and tobacco . Counted by AAA County Committees and forwarded to the Department of Agriculture ballots showed that of the 2,700,000 farmers eligible to vote , about 1,700,000 had done so . <P> A Wallace quota on any crop can only be imposed if a two-thirds majority of voting farmers favor it . Last week , 1,189,496 cotton farmers voted for , 97,456 against a quota . Biggest majority was South Carolina 's ( 96% ) , smallest Oklahoma 's ( 76% ) . Dark tobacco growers voted for a quota 38,209 to 8,746 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's cotton quota has already been set at 26,300,000 acres , to produce a 10,125,000 bale crop ( 8,621,000 under last year 's ) . Dark tobacco quotas will be 145,000,000 Ibs. , flue-cured tobacco 705,000,000 . Fines for over-productive farmers , whether they voted for or against quotas , will be two cents a pound for cotton , 50% of the market price for tobacco . Said Administrator H. R. Tolley , " We consider the vote an overwhelming endorsement of the new farm program . "
