JAPANESE LADY IN EUROPE - Haruko Ichikawa-Button ( $2.50 ) . <P> The stock picture of a Japanese traveler is an immaculate , youthful-looking , polite , poker-faced Oriental who goes about with a small , expensive camera taking photographs of fortifications , air fields and the like , collects trade secrets , lets nothing escape his foxy eyes , but rarely writes a travel book .

Flat-heeled , brown-clad English women all looked like schoolteachers . Under the withering catechism of Author Walter De La Mare , Madame Ichikawa admitted that the only things good about England were " the policeman , cart-horses and Simpson 's beef-steak. " * The worst example of English bad taste she found in her hotel lavatory , where the toilet-paper was stamped with an advertisement showing " a lovely little child 's face . " Peering through heavy bars at the British crown in the Tower of London , she wished that she could be in the crown 's place looking out at the acquisitive expression on the faces of the onlookers . <P> As impressive as anybody along the way were the Chinese " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite their screaming anti-Japanese " banners everywhere , treated her with unfailing courtesy . Her concluding thought was that the Chinese " seem to be likely to inherit the earth and go on forever , while the Japanese , Italians and other Latin peoples go neurotic and mad , followed by the English . . . .
