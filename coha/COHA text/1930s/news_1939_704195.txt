txt Bernard Baruch , former chairman of the World War Industries Board , said at the White House yesterday that if this country is wise it will not try to get too high prices for goods it sells to customers attracted to U. S. markets during emergencies abroad . He said it would be easy to lose the new customers after a war if the prices were too high , and added that fair prices would destroy the barter system of Germany . Mr. Baruch said that he believed America 's policy should be one of complete preparedness .
