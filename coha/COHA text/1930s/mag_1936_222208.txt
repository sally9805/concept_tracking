Early one sunny afternoon last week the Coast Guard cutter Potomac finally brought a bronzed and beaming President back to Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , from a 16-day fishing holiday . For three days while tornadoes had been uprooting towns through the South , killing over 400 citizens , the Potomac , warned of possible hurricanes at sea , had been dodging from cay to cay rather than risk crossing the open channel between Florida and the Bahamas . Gaily Franklin Roosevelt told waiting newshawks how only an hour before while the Potomac was steaming at ten knots , he had caught a bonito , trolling over the stern rail . <P> Few days before , James Roosevelt had gone ashore by plane from the cutter with the news that his father was playing politics with his naval aide , Captain Wilson Brown , his military aide , Colonel Edwin M. Watson . The Press now wanted to know who had won . Franklin Roosevelt looked blank until someone explained they meant the dice-and-pin game called " Politics " ( TIME , Feb. 3 ) . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson was elected ! " <P> " Elected to what ? " <P> " Elected President . " <P> " On what ticket ? " <P> " Oh , we did n't bother about tickets , " grinned the President shrewdly . " He just got elected . " <P> From the instant the Potomac touched shore , the President plunged into the real game of politics . Waiting for him at Fort Lauderdale were Governors McNutt of Indiana and Sholtz of Florida . Next day at Warm Springs , Ga . his political business was with Archibald D. Lovett and Marion H. Allen , anti-Talmadge leaders in Georgia . <P> Few hours later , as his special moved north he saw out of the window more &; more evidence of the storms which harried the South earlier in the week . He met the real disaster late at night when his train halted for half an hour at Gainesville where a tornado had devasted the main square of the town . There he appeared on the back platform around which 2,000 silent townspeople were grouped . " My friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back some day at a less tragic time . . . . I shall always be very proud of the spirit you have shown . " <P> With the President back in Washington , the business of the U. S. once more got under way with a Cabinet meeting . Governor Brann of Maine , who threatened to quit the Democratic ticket , had to be seen and conciliated . General Johnson ( " stage money " ) Hagood had to be seen and given command of the Sixth Corps Area at Chicago in place of the Texas command from which he was ousted two months ago . <P> In Baltimore before 10,000 Young Democrats , the President confounded those who had predicted that until election day he would abandon attacks on business , would soft-pedal talk of new reforms . Said he of industry : <P> " Industry can contribute in great measure to the increase of employment if industry as a whole will undertake reasonable reductions of hours of work per week , while , at the same time , they keep the average individual 's pay envelope at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " The best that the captains of the country could do for you before the Depression was not good enough then , and it is not good enough today .
