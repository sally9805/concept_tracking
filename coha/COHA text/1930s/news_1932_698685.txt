txt The trial a Mrs. Granville B. Fortescue , American society matron , Lieut . Thomas IL Massie , U. S. N. , her Kentucky-bred son-in-law , and two sailor defendants , E. 7 . Lord and Albert 0 . Jones , began this morning before Circuit Judge Charles S. Davis . The four are accused of second degree murder as the result of the " honor slaying " of Joseph Kahahawai , the son of a Hawaiian street car conductor , and accused of raping Mrs. Fortescue 's daughter , 20 year old Thalia Massie , wife of the naval officer . In a summerlike courtroom , with swaying palms , green vistas and a quiet but colorful crowd outside visible through the windows , the strange drama began to unfold . It promises a legal battle with few parallels , a story of passions with an almost unbelievable opening of a Pan. ? dora box of sex , racial and political troubles . Officially it is case " No. 11 , - 891 , territory of Hawaii against Grace Fortescue et al. , " but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States navy against the people of this defamed , proud , suffering paradise of the Pacific . Six Jurors Selected . The net result of the first day 's session was that six jurors were tentatively chosen , with the veteran criminal lawyer , Clarence Darrow a Chicago , chief a the defense counsel , giving an exhibition of probing into human mentality such as seldom has been witnessed on this island . The lawyer who is approaching Ms 75th birthday , was in fine form as he squared away with bent shoulders , unshaven face , folded arms and ' unruly gray hair . The love of battle was again exhibited by this man who has defended hundreds of men and women in courts of justice . Darrow clashed with a young prosecutor , John S. Kelley , a fighting Irishman from Montana , over the attitude of one Henry P. Beckley , a prospective juror . Beckley , a part Hawaiian and a ranch manager , said he was a descendant of native royalty . Darrow , in an effort to show he was ineligible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason unknown to the defense and that he had a Prejudice against the defendants . The prosecution sought to show his fairness and won technically when Judge Davis permitted Beckley to remain . Former Honolulu Policeman . Beckley is a former member of the police under Patrick Gleason , the sheriff who was deposed from power as one result of the Massie rape case and the Kahahawai killing scandal . The six tentative jurors include two Chinese , one Hawaiian , one Japanese and two Americans . reflecting the Hawaiian interracial experiment sharply . There was no indication in the examination today that either side is paying particular attention to racial lines . which is naturally unimportant in the mind of Darrow , but questions as to whether Kahahawai was guilty or innocent of raping Mrs. Massie , and relations with the United States navy were interjected immediately into the case . The question of the guilt of the young Hawaiian athlete , upon which the jury disagreed but on which the Fortescue  --  Massie family should have exclusive information , promises to be one of the early legal debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the court ruled that it ' be kept out unless it bore in a general way on the- question of opinions . wul Argue Yount . Barry Ulrich , a : aarvard man and assistant prosecutor , said the issue will be argued soon and took the ground that there is no difference under the law whether Kahahawai was guilty or not . Darrow said it made a great difference what the pi ? ospective jurors thought about this . - Most of those examined had Me opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the four murder defendants . Only a half dozen were dismissed because they held opinions , and it may be possible to complete a jury within a few days . Police precautions in handling the crowds apparently were unnecessary as only about 100 persons gathered fn front of the courthouse when the ! defendants arrived in care of naval officers ' from their prison home on the U. S. S. Alton at Pearl Harblr . The were chiefly Hawaiians . They showed a deep interest in the case . There were few whites present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her place on a bench directly in front of the judge . Her step was firm , her bearing cold and controlled , her face never smiling . She seemed thinking of remote things and places as she waited in this strange place for this ordeal and fate reserved for her . She wore a maroon suit and hat . Her face was unrouged . Lieut . Massie in civilian clothes was near her , and the two sailors , Lord and Jones , looked as if they had no worries . Mrs. J. L. Ripley of New York and Robert Bell , sister and brother of Mrs. Fortescue , sat behind her in the courtroom . Mrs. Massie did not appear . Joseph Kahahawai Sr. , father of the dead youth , was also in the front row a few seats away . He was chewing gum and his eyes were hidden by dark glasses . Two Hawaiian women in brilliant colored jackets and hats added a touch to the somber scene . They were the slain man 's mother and sister . Society Women Present . A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored politicians , and a few society women of Honolulu were in the audience . Mrs. Walter Dillingham , social leader here and well known in the Washington , Chicago . and New York circles where Mrs. Fortescue formerly moved , had Ei seat in the mixed audience . Army and navy personnel were conspicuous by their absence . Griffith Wight , former prosecutor in the Ala Moaner rape case , and Attorney Ben Pittman , brother of the United States senator , and one of the lawyers who defended Kahahawai and four others in the rape case , had seats near the bar . The outcome of the second trial of the rape case , it is generally agreed , hinges on the result of this trial . LURED TO HIS DEATH . Joseph Kahahawai was lured from Honolulu 's judiciary building by a fake court summons on Jan. 8 . His friends never saw him alive again . Later the same day his body , shot through the chest , was found shrouded in a sheet in a motor car driven by Mrs. Fortescue , the gray haired society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car were Lieut . Massie and Seaman Lord . These three , with Seaman Jones , who was found on guard at the Massie home , were arrested and charged with second degree murder . Police at the time of the arrests said they believed that Kahahawai had been tortured before being killed . When the young Hawaiian was abducted he was making his daily report at the judiciary building pending retrial , with four others , on charges of raping the attractive Mrs. Massie . Points Out Assailant . Mrs. Massie was criminally assaulted on a lonely road in the island on the night of Sept. 12 after she had left a party at the Ala Wai inn in the Waikiki district of Honolulu to take a-walk . At the trial of the accused rapists Mrs. Massie pointed out Kahahawai as the man who beat her and broke her jaw after he and his companions had attacked her .
