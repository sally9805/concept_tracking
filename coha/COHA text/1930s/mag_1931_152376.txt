" The United States might eventually be forced to occupy Liberia by treaty , as it did Haiti ; in which event , one important difference would recommend itself to the Government : The occupying force should consist of Negro soldiers and Negro officers , instead of brutal , arrogant , prejudiced white Marines . Intelligent Negro officers are available on the reserve list , and they could bring to their task of ending slavery a sympathy and a tact that were conspicuously missing in the American occupation of Haiti . " <P> So wrote last week the Negro editor of Harlem 's Amsterdam News But " brutal , arrogant , prejudiced " were no words to apply in Negro newspaper or elsewhere to at least one U. S. Marine in Haiti , the Marine known as King Wirkus I of La Gonave , whose Haitian career , unusual and newsworthy , approached its end last week . <P> Out of the Pittstown , Pa. , coal mines at 17 , stocky , square-faced , blue-eyed Faustin E. Wirkus enlisted in the Marine Corps , was shipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny outpost of Anse Gallet , he saw a hard-boiled tax collector drag in a big black Haitian woman who had defied the law . She said she was Queen Timemenne of La Gonave . Sergeant Wirkus smoothed out her troubles , got her free . <P> In 1922 as a lieutenant in the Haitian Garde he was put in command of a squad of native troops on La Gonave , a sparsely settled , primitive island ( 35 mi. by 3 mi. ) three-and-one-half hours by motorboat from Port-au-Prince out in the bay . The black islanders swarmed down to greet Lieut . Wirkus , for Timemenne , their queen , had told them of his great goodness . Later tom-toms tommed . Clarine+ flowed down black throats . Ebony girls danced soberly . And upon the unruly yellow hair of the white man was put a tall crown of silk , glass bits , sea shells . The natives called him King Wirkus I and he ruled jointly with Queen Timemenne for eight years . <P> The natives built him a concrete house on the northeastern shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rode over it on horseback . He doctored adults with castor oil and quinine , treated babies according to the rules laid down in Dr. Holt 's Care and Feeding of Children . He served as midwife . He showed native fishermen how to fix their nets , farmers how to irrigate their gardens . He dispensed ready but gentle justice . <P> Last year King Wirkus I was transferred back to Port-au-Prince . In March he will return to the U. S. , to be discharged from the service . Now 35 , shrewd , reticent , he will be adopted by a wealthy man in Florida . Soon to be published is his book The White King . From Haiti he will bring with him cinema films of Voodoo cere monies , wild tribal dances , mystic sexual rites which his friends fear no censor will pass . <P> +From sugar cane .
