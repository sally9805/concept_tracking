txt A Democratic landslide in Chicago today returned Mayor Edward J. Kelly to the office to which he was appointed by the City Council two years ago after the assassination a Mayor Cermak . Backed by a powerful organization , Mayor Kelly received the largest percentage of the vote ever given to a Mayoralty candidate here , and he carried every one of the fifty wards , the first time that such an unqualified victory was ever recorded in the city . Complete returns showed that Mr. Kelly received 75.84 per cent of the vote . His plurality over Emil C. Wetten , Republican , was 631,579 and his majority over both Mr. Wetten and Newton Jenkins , candidate of the third party , was 543,853 . The total vote cast was 1,052,447 out of a total registration of 1,503 , - 303 , divided as follows : Mayor Kelly , 798,150 ; Mr. Wetten , 166,571 , and Mr. Jenkins , 87,726 . The highest vote previously recorded for a candidate in a Chicago Mayoralty contest was the 671,189 given to Mayor Cermak , who also scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plurality and majority-194,257 . Mayor Kelly 's principal comment on the result was an expression of his pleasure that Chicago as a municipality is more united than it ever has been before and that he had been authorized to speak for the city in its entirety . " The figures , " he said , " are , of course , more eloquent than anything I can say ; but I can not refrain from expression of the gratitude that is mine in this , the greatest moment of my life . " Chicago , speaking through a great majority of all its voters , has given me the right to speak and act for it . " The vote once more emphasizes that the people of Chicago want an efficient . an economical administration characterized by action and not promises  --  that they will always condemn vilification in political campaigns and approve constructive proposals . " The Mayor carried with him his running mates . City Clerk Peter J. Brady was re-elected . Gustave A. Brand , a new face in politics , was chosen as City Treasurer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major public office in Cook County . Patrick A. Nash , chairman of the Cook County Democratic organization and national committeeman , issued a statement thanking all the Republicans who voted the Democratic ticket . " They showed that they valued good government above petty partisan considerations , " he said . " Mayor Kelly now has a clear mandate to carry out his constructive policies in the next four years . " It is especially pleasing to me that the voters have shown that they appreciate all that Mayor Kelly has done to reduce taxes and institute sound economics and to redeem the good name of Chicago . " Off to Washington at Once . Mayor Kelly plans to go to Washington , possibly tomorrow or Thursday , to place before the Federal Government a public works program of more than $265,000,000 , for which he will seek Federal funds . A lake-front airport and superhighways for the city are among the projects . The Mayor received a telegram today from Harry L. Hopkins , Federal Relief Administrator , inviting him to hasten East to outline a program to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill which is now in conference in Congress . As the Democratic vote mounted to record highs , speculation developed here as to President Roosevelt 's reaction to the demonstration of Mr. Kelly 's power as a vote getter . A message congratulating the Chicago Democracy from either the President or Postmaster General Farley , party chairman , would be interpreted here as dispelling reports that the Washington administration was holding aloof from the local Democratic organization . Since Mr. Wetten made no campaign , the vote he received was ascribed almost entirely to the party label , which was supported by dyed-in-the-wool Republicans regardless of the immediate situation . " There is n't much to say , " Mr. Wetten said , " except that the resuit confirms what has been repeatedly published  --  that the Republican party is completely disintegrated . In fact , there is no local Republican party . " Third Party Backers Disappointed . The poor showing of the third party was regarded as a blow to the hopes of Mr. Jenkins , a veteran Illinois progressive leader , that the Chicago election returns would lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national scale . This , it had been expected , would materialize through a union with other progressive groups in Wisconsin , Nebraska , South Dakota and Minnesota . Mr. Jenkins , in a statement de-clared : " I do n't envy Mr. Kelly in his difficult position . I wish him and his associates every success . The third party will be glad to cooperate with them in any sound program they may adopt in the best interests of the city and the citizens . " The size of our vote , as tabulated , is , of course , disappointing . Issues were raised by our opponents which are deeply rooted in human history . In spite of these difficulties , however , we witness today the birth of a new political party . The third party is now a reality . We face the future knowing that we have lost a battle , but firm in the conviction that we will win the war . The third party is dedicated to our country . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
