If Adolf Hitler 's daily doings had not been so fully accounted for in the press last week , janitors and lollers might have looked twice at a sight in a hearing room in the House Office Building . Even so , those who did look blinked . Up to testify before the Dies Committee on UnAmerican Activities strode a militant-looking Hitler counterpart clad in a brownshirt uniform and Sam Browne belt , with a dab of mustache and a Fhrerish haircut . Cameras clicked and Chairman Dies , who had lately been short of headlines , beamed . <P> The witness was John C. Metcalfe , a newspaperman who joined Nazi Fritz Kuhn 's German-American Bund in order to spill its secrets in Chicago 's tabloid Times . Put on the Dies Committee payroll as an investigator , he testified before it two months ago that the Bund , on the surface a minuscule singing , beer-bibbing and marching society , was in reality a hateful Nazi network with some 500,000 U.S. sympathizers . Last week Chairman Dies made a timely move by recalling Witness Metcalfe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Bund uniform for photographers . <P> What Mr. Metcalfe had to say was almost as lurid as his appearance . The Bund , said he , was a fighting subversive force that had penetrated into U. S. navy yards and aircraft factories , was prepared to " muster a force " of 5,000 soldiers . Some of Witness Metcalfe 's quotations : <P> Bundsman Albert Zimmer of Cincinnati : " No one knows this , but we have a permanent list of silent contributors . Most of these persons are wealthy . . . so I keep a double set of books . " Declared Witness Metcalfe : " It is generally understood in Bund circles that some prominent American industrialists are helping to finance the movement . ' ' <P> Bund Fhrer Kuhn : " I have a special arrangement with Hitler and Germany that whenever any of our groups have trouble with the consuls in their districts they are to report it to me in full detail . I then take it up with the Ambassador . " According to Mr. Metcalfe , Ambassador Hans Dieckhoff replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly for the Bund . <P> This last was too much for chunky little Ambassador Dieckhoff , who trotted to the State Department to protest to Secretary Hull . He pointed out that Germany has done all it can do by forbidding its own nationals to join the Bund . " Un-officially , " Embassy Counselor Dr. Hans Thomsen called Witness Metcalfe untrustworthy . Counselor Thomsen asked why the Dies committee did not call Fhrer Kuhn to testify . <P> Chairman Dies retorted that he would call Fuhrer Kuhn on condition that he produce all Bund records . Then he added : ' ' We have almost conclusive evidence that Kuhn ordered all Bund posts throughout the U. S. to destroy their records . . . . " <P> A few days later , when Leader Kuhn turned up in uniform to address a Bund meeting at Union City , N.J. , a crowd of 2,000 anti-Nazis interrupted his dinner at Bund headquarters with boos and brickbats , bum's-rushed him fuming out of town .                 @ @ @ @
