txt The repute of Senator GLASS , on account of his work in the enactment of the Federal Reserve law , is deservedly so high that his judgment of its needed amendment is entitled to respect . We must confess regret , however , at the position which he appears to have taken in regard to the bill which he has laid before the Senate Banking Committee .. That is not because we disagree with all I of its purposes . Some of its provisions are designed to control the use of member bank credit , which had been most unwisely employed in 1928 and 1929 . Others undertake to invoke the Reserve System 's facilities with a view to effecting much-needed reforms in liquidation of insolvent banking institutions . The great defect of the bill , in its first draft , is that all ; of its dozen or more separate alterations in the system 's machinery and practice  --  changes differing widely , alike in their scope and in the judgment which one or another of them would arouse in the minds of disinterested experts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might separately be approved , are linked inseparably with other provisions which might for wholly different reasons be disapproved . To ask support of the measure as a whole would amount to insisting that friendly critics accept innovations which they dislike , in order to secure adoption of others which they regard favorably . They would be invited to do so though the different provisions have nothing whatever to do with one another . Mr. Glass is quoted as citing the " propaganda " of the banking community against the original Federal Reserve bill of 1913 . Opposition by many bankers , doubtless taking the form of " propaganda , " is a matter of history . But what was the sequel ? Was it , one may ask , the " rushing through " of the original draft without submitting its provisions to the light of searching criticism , favorable and unfavorable , in public hearings ? On the contrary , such hearings were opened shortly after the House ? Federal Reserve bill had been submitted , at the end of June , and were continued nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony in favor of the bill as against it , and some 1 of the most salutary amendments to the original draft were indirectly the result . ' Public satisfaction with the completed measure , when it was finally enacted in I December , was in no small degree caused by knowledge that the measure had been fully and freely subjected to open discussion by friends and foes alike , and in the end had stood the test . The Federal Reserve act of 1913 was a harmonious measure . Support or opposition was based , as a rule , not on particular provisions but on its general purport and framework . The bill now under consideration presents a great variety of independent and individually separate grounds of controversy . Its provisions ought to have at least as full public hearings as the Reserve act had . Perhaps it would have been more fortunate if the dozen or more proposed alterations had been submitted in the shape of a dozen or more separate amendatory bills .                @ @ @ @ @
