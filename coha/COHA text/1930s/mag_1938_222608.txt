( See front cover ) <P> Florida is a fabulous place , a low-lying ( max. elev. 325 ft. ) peninsula full of paradoxes and contrasts , great banality and great excitement . It offers to the observer hurricanes and breathless heat , some of the world 's healthiest fish and scrawniest cattle , the unbelievably hard living of the Everglades and the unbelievably soft living of Palm Beach . Every year 2,000,000 visitors drive , ride , sail and fly there to see such divergent sights as the matchless Rubens collection in the Ringling Art Museum at Sarasota , the barbarously gaudy architecture of Hollywood , the flowerlike flamingos in the infield at Hialeah and the old people quietly dying in their rattan chairs at St. Petersburg . Florida is bounded by the utter reality of the bean fields around Lake Okeechobee , and the utter unreality of the skyscrapers over Miami . <P> No community so rich in the stuff of life could fail to provide a political scene of more than common interest and activity . True to form , with the Democratic primary elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restlessly ending a notably lively three-cornered fight for the nomination which would mean the occupancy of Claude Pepper 's U. S. Senate seat . For the past six weeks , Messrs . David Sholtz , Mark Wilcox and Claude Pepper , as well as two other minor candidates whose names not even many Florida voters knew , had been touring Florida 's sticky villages and sun-blistered swamp towns , its resort cities and its inland flatwoods , to an accompaniment of loudspeakers , floodlights , bad cigars and baby-kissing such as to challenge the memory of the State 's oldest inhabitant . The windup found the candidates characteristically occupied . <P> On the west coast , a large sound truck equipped with a gramophone &; amplifier nearly deafened the citizens of Pensacola with the Dipsy Doodle . This was the preface to an address by the State 's onetime ( 1933-37 ) Governor Sholtz in which that dignitary found occasion to remark : " Either the Junior Senator is telling a deliberate untruth or he does n't know what he is talking about . " In Frostproof , near the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " a better friend to the old people than those who give them lip service in Florida and never mention their cause in Washington . " To the north , on the road between Kissimmee and St. Cloud , a motorcade of some 50 cars met the State 's Junior Senator Pepper , escorted him with honking horns to St. Cloud 's city limits where he was met by the town 's band and drum corps . From St. Cloud , the motorcade , swollen to 250 , followed the Senator around Polk County through Davenport , Haines City , Auburndale and Winter Haven to Bartow where Claude Pepper climaxed a typical day by announcing to a crowd of 2,000 that he would vote for the Townsend plan even if the President vetoed it . <P> Issues . Politics in Florida are relatively simple . Whoever wins the Democratic nomination gets the job . The issues in the Florida primary race are not complex either . They are three :
