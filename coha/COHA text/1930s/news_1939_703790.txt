txt Our Unsolved Rail Problem We Might , It Is Believed ; Take a Leaf From Britain 's Book To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The program of the committee of railroad executives and labor leaders Is good so far as it goes , but it does not go far enough . In facts can one expect that a program drafted alone by these two parties in interest should be complete ? There has been no representative of the shippers who need low rates , nor of the investors who have supplied 826,000 of capital per railroad worker . ' Further employment on the railroads and in the railroad supply industries will depend upon getting new capital . If the private investor gets a square deal he will furnish additional funds . If he does not , the government will have to furnish them . Like Canada , we may slide quite unwittingly and unwillingly into government ownership through lack of a coherent and sound policy . Four Major Requirements The major recommendations of this joint committee and of the I. C. C. make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , viz : 1 . Compulsory consolidation is essential . The British Railway Act of 1921 copied the American Transportation Act of 1920 . However , Parliament incorporated a clause requiring the 120 British roads themselves to prepare a scheme of consolidation within two years , with the understanding that if they did not the government itself would write it . The results were speedy . The railroads prepared their own plan . Thereupon 120 roads were consolidated into four systems . Concessions were made by labor , by management and by the investor . The plan succeeded . During the violent fluctuations in business since 1928 no British railroad went into bankruptcy . In the United States almost 40 per cent of the roads are in bankruptcy . In fact , in the great systems like the Pennsylvania and Union Pacific there are many constituent roads which would be in bankruptcy today if they had not been previously consolidated with a strong group . The objections to consolidation on the part of labor , of management and of the I. C. C. are unsound and short-sighted . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would introduce a bill calling for the abandonment of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act directing the I. C. C. to formulate a national plan of consolidation and requiring adherence to such pattern by all subsequent major proposals . The I. C. C. and the railroad managements and Congress have been fiddling with consolidation for eighteen years since the Esch-Cummins Transportation Act was passed . Does Senator Wheeler propose another indefinite period of fiddling , or shall we not rather attempt to follow the successful experience of Great Britain ? Price and Cost Control 2 . In all private business , selling prices and costs are under one control . There can be no railroad " solution " until wage rates and freight rates are treated either by the same authority or else simultaneously or at least with reference to each other . 3 . The whole system of working rules must be revised . - The rail executives ' silence on this subject is regrettable , and labor 's reluctance to open this subject is ominous and against the public interest . My friend C. E. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the American railroads well and who was consulted as to whether there were any " feather bed " rules in England , wrote me as follows : " You may take it for granted , however , that we do not give our employes back pay for many years for work not done , and there is no possible comparable case to that of the famous Lehigh Valley one , which has been quoted so extensively in the United States . We do not pay men for not doing work . Though our employes benefit from a guaranteed day and a guaranteed week , it is up ' to the railways to provide them with work to keep them busy during the whole day and the whole week . I think it would be true to say that our conciliation agreements allow considerable latitude , and an express locomotive crew may be called upon to return with a freight train if necessary , to switch at any junction and , generally , to make the best use of their time . " I would go further and say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of such rules as I see are in force on the American railways , which tend to make railway operation both difficult and ineffective from the labor standpoint . " Britain 's Impartial Boards 4 . Our mediation and arbitration boards are not constituted to function impartially as in Great Britain . There a series of these boards rising in rank from local to national standing is composed of representatives of three groups , one appointed by the railroad managements , one by railroad labor and a neutral third appointed by the government and in some cases the public or the shippers . Such a board at least gives an opportunity for both sides to be presented at the bar of public opinion and for the minority case to be publicly stated . In our country we have a single referee arbitrating small cases . If this referee decides against labor he is reviled and usually not reassigned . If he decides for labor , his status is permanent . The ' results are obvious . As for the National Mediation Board , it consists of three appointed government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against labor , no matter how just , would find tremendous pressure exerted for their removal . The history of recent labor decisions indicates the defective character of the constitution of these boards . These four omissions are vital . Failure to treat them courageously , realistically and frankly will lead only to further grief . The railroads are in anarchy . Now is the time to undertake a fundamental solution . Failure to do so will precipitate a worse evil  --  new and great problems of government ownership of an industry which Is now in chaos and which the existing government personnel has proved itself to be utterly incompetent to handle , even on its present basis , under which the responsibility is on the management and not the government , and the losses are on the investor and not on the United States Treasury . Four Presidents since 1920- failed to solve the railroad problem . This is a challenge to the present Administration. , It has attacked and solved larger prob . lems than this . ELISHA M. lisanourArt . New York , Jan. 31 , 1939 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We Are Held to Be Not Without Blame To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW lbnx TIMES : ' Edward Adams Richardson writes to Tau TIMES that " the government and people of Japan should be advised more exactly pf the point of view of the American people . " Mr. Richardson seems to think that ( 1 ) Japan should conduct itself in accordance with what he thinks to be the point of view of the American people  --  though he would probably feel outraged at the suggestion that this country should be governed by Japanese opinion  --  and that ( 3 ) the Japanese people are inadequately in. formed as to trends of opinion here . The answer to the second of these opinions , which is the one most explicitly embodied in his letter , makes it unnecessary to discuss the first . No people on earth are more cognizant of or more sensitive to foreign opinion than are the Japanese . The Japanese , however , are not much moved by adverse American criticism at the present moment . I mention three reasons for this : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not generally shared by Americans who know them best , but mainly by those who , not knowing them , are easily misled by propaganda . 2 . They have seen specimens of the misinformation and misrepresentation which have created these sentiments . 3 . They are aware of the interests served by this propaganda , much of which emanates from third countries , hostile to Japan . This sort of propaganda has had a wide influence upon American opinion before . It is influencing it now . But it is useless to hope to change the minds of the Japanese or to win their friendship by telling them , about their own country , things that they know to be untrue . A great many Japanese like America . A great many Americans like Japan . But it is quite untrue that , at any time during the past thirty years , we have been a perfectly " good neighbor " to that country . On the contrary , the United States Government , though sometimes against the advice of its own heads , has frequently affronted it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong way , but it is easily arguable that , taking the interchange as a whole , the balance is against us . That is not because the people of either country are bad and unfriendly . These defects are not the dominant characteristics of either nation , but what friction there has been seems to result more from what some people call " democracy " here than from the form of government that exists in Japan . ( The Rev. ) JOHN COLE . Peekskill , N. Y. , Jan. 29 , 1939 . Entertainment for Workers To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Reading in THE TIMES about mechanical music on a Brooklyn pier for the beguilement of longshoremen recalled to mind a somewhat similar plan that I saw in operation many years ago in Havana . In one of the cigar factories there the operatives sat at work benches in a large rectangular high-ceilinged room . Above them in a sort of pulpit was a fellow who read news of the day from the current newspapers and supplemented that with short stories or novels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on the cigarmakers , whose fingers worked nimbly cutting , filling , rolling and shaping the cigars , while their behatted heads kept bobbing up and down in a sort of rhythm that synchronized with the melodic tones of the reader . It appeared to be good psychology to pace production and it was an effective antidote for a monotonous job . T. A. DWYER . New Haven . Conn .. Jan. 29. 1939 . Tardiness in Court To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : ' I was interested in reading your report of Justice Steinbrink 's remarks to a housewife juror for being late . I assume that this justice has never been late , but a lot of them have been and some of them are habitually so . I was unfortunate enough to be accepted as a juror in a first degree mut ' ? der case . We were required to be in our places at 10 A. M. , lawyers , jurors and spectators . The presiding justice was always late , generally about half an hour ; one morning he came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but I did wonder why the lawyers stood for it without a protest . F. 0 . SEAM .
