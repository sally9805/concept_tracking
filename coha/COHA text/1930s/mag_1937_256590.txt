Melt copper with tin and you get bronze , probably the oldest , certainly one of the most useful alloys in the world . Last week the Albright Art Gallery of Buffalo popped into the spotlight with an exhibition illustrating the history of bronze-casting from about 3000 B.C. to the 20th Century . Eschewing such utilitarian objects as Roman swords , motorboat propellers and bank tellers ' cages , the gallery has assembled a collection of 173 statuettes , all of them of first rank , only one ( a Degas figurine ) the property of the Albright Art Gallery . Most liberal lenders were New York 's Metropolitan Museum , which offered 33 pieces , the Boston Museum of Fine Arts , which loaned 26 . Such private collectors as John Pierpont Morgan , Jules Semon Bache , William Randolph Hearst , George Blumenthal , Mrs. John Davison Rockefeller Jr . chipped in , too . <P> Best of Buffalo 's bronzes : two owls dated approximately 1122 B.C. ; a gilt Buddha whose first private owner , the Empress Dowager 's Viceroy Tuan Fang , acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had guarded it ; a group of Renaissance pieces from the Dreyfus collection , just bought by Andrew Mellon for his new national museum ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) ; two Benvenuto Cellinis ; David with the Head of Goliath , only known bronze by Luca della Robbia beside his famed doors for the Florence Cathedral ; the earliest of six known figures by Daumier of " Ratapoil , " his famed caricature of a Bonapartist agitator . <P> If the Albright Gallery had nothing of its own to match these in quality there was at least one other public service it could perform . It published an elaborate catalog illustrating each piece with a full-page plate and giving a scholarly introduction to each section of the catalog . These were not prepared by the Buffalo Museum 's staff but by leading authorities in the U. S. on each particular field . Orientalist Arthur Upham Pope wrote on Persian bronzes , the Metropolitan 's Gisela M. A. Richter covered those of Greece and Rome , Art Dealer Stephan Bourgeois wrote on modern bronzes . <P> Footing the bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polo players in the U. S. , Seymour Horace Knox . Son of a Woolworth partner and a potent investment banker in his own right , Poloist Knox has a burning ambition to make East Aurora and the Buffalo district as famed for polo as Long Island . He was captain of the squash racquets team sent to Britain in 1935 . His active interest in art is recent . To date his private collection consists of one Utrillo bought a few months ago , and the collector 's bug .
