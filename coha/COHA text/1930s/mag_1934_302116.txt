VILLAGE TALE-Phil Stong-Harcourt , Brace ( $2 ) . <P> " Woman 's place is the home , and I could tell you which room . " So says an unrepentant old sinner in Author Stong 's latest bucolic melodrama . But the actions of Village Tale 's unashamed characters speak even louder than their pungent words . This highly colored tale of country wickedness will , like State Fair and Stranger 's Return , find a welcome in Hollywood . <P> To outward appearances , the biggest thing that ever happened in Brunswick , Iowa was the daily arrival of the 6:45 , which sometimes came in on time . But plenty of other excitement went on just below the surface . Drury . the town villain , was making a cuckold out of little Bolly Hootman . Slaughter Somerville , No. 1 Citizen , was in love with the deacon 's wife . Station Agent Ben doggedly pursued cat-like Lulu , unaware that she was after Slaughter . When the deacon found Slaughter and his pretty wife practicing hymns together in the church and peppered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head . Villain Drury , not content with hurting Bolly 's feelings by letting him see his horns , picked a fight , nearly killed him . When Slaughter found out what had happened he did the same to Drury . Bolly drowned his shame in the river , and Drury was arrested for murder . To make a clean slate , Slaughter took the deacon 's wife , Lulu left town with the conductor of the 6:45.
