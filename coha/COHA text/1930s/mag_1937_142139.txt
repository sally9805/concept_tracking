CATHERINE DE ' MEDICI-Ralph Roeder - Viking ( $3.75 ) . <P> The career of Catherine de ' Medici , one of the biggest career women of the Reformation , was a long time starting , came as near as nothing to never starting at all . <P> Orphaned within a month of her birth ( 1519 ) , she was such a sickly infant that her Great-Uncle Giovanni ( Pope Leo X ) was doubly disgusted with her . What was needed at that point in the Medici fortunes was a healthy boy . Having at last attained the Papacy , the Medici clan were in imminent danger of petering out . But useless as she might be in her own small person , Uncle Giovanni planned to use her as a political pawn , schemed how to marry her to best Medici advantage . <P> Cousin Giulio , who succeeded Giovanni in the Papacy , wangled a more brilliant match for little Catherine than old Pope Leo had dared to dream about . At 14 she became the bride of heavy-lidded Henri , second son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to conceive a child , and her sterility became important when the Dauphin died and her husband became heir to the throne . By trying everything once she managed , after ten barren years , to become a mother . Thereafter she triumphantly proved her ability by producing nine more children . <P> Europe was having its troubles , but Catherine let Europe take care of itself . As a model wife and mother , she had her hands full at home . Henri had never made any secret of his infatuation for Diane de Poitiers , who was old enough to be his nurse , and Catherine even had to share her children with her rival . Only very occasionally did Catherine let her feelings come to the surface . Once Diane found her reading , asked what the book was . Said Catherine : " I am reading the chronicles of France , and I find that from time to time , at every period , the affairs of Kings have been governed by strumpets .

One unlucky day he ran one course too many with the Captain of his Guard and got the point of a lance in the eye . <P> With his death Catherine had her chance to pay off old scores . All she did was make Diane give up the crown jewels , retire to her estates . <P> At 40 Catherine was the widow of one king , mother of another , but she was still not even an amateur of politics . As a widowed mother with a large family to look after , she gradually turned as professional as a U. S. Postmaster General . <P> During the reign of her first son , sickly Frangois II , she waited and watched ; at his death she declared herself Regent for her second surviving son , 10-year-old Charles IX . Now she found that her family affairs were the parlous state of the nation .
