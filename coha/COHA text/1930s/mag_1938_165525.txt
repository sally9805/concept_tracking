Following up the swift surprise offensive which carried across the Ebro River last fortnight to make a 240-square-mile dent in the north side of Rightist Generalissimo Franco 's salient-to-the-sea , Spain 's Leftists last week launched another . The second dented the south side of the salient , some 30 miles west of battered Teruel . Taking advantage of the fact that the Rightists had shipped 40,000 troops from the Teruel area to the Ebro front , bald-domed General Jos Miaja , commander-in-chief on the southern Leftist front , pushed his forces through thinly-held Rightist lines in the Universales Mountains . He drove down the Guadalaviar River valley for six miles , to within nine miles of Albarracin , which commands a broad , unfortified plateau leading to Teruel , only 19 miles away . <P> Thus Leftists last week continued the game of distracting General Franco . As long as they can punch him from one side , make him turn in that direction , then punch him from the other , they can keep him from following his own plan of battle . In the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franco , fighting not only the Leftists but the heat which reached 113 , relied chiefly on his sun-baked Moorish riflemen , last week made relatively little progress in straightening out the dents in his fronts . <P> This week , as the heat lessened , the Rightists launched one of the most powerful assaults of the war . Along a ten-mile stretch on the farthest inland portion of the Ebro front , the Rightists hammered their way forward aided by strafing planes , hurled the Leftists back across the river and placed themselves in a position to make the rest of the Leftists ' Ebro line untenable . Some 7,000 Leftists were reported killed , wounded or captured . Leftists claimed , however , that their offensive had upset Franco 's summer plans and destroyed the possibility of a Franco victory before the end of the year . In Saragossa , the Rightist Defense Ministry called for recruits from among its 18-year-olds to enter infantry service by the end of the month .                  @ @ @
