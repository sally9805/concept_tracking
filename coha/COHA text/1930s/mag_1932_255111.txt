This year 's enthusiasm for U. S. painting and its founders moved forward in New York last week with two memorial exhibitions . One , at the Metropolitan Museum of the portraits and landscapes of Samuel Finley Breese Morse , commemorated the 100th anniversary of the telegraph . One , at the Public Library of the amazing wood engravings of Timothy Cole , famed craftsman of the ' 90s , recalled the **27;7174;TOOLONG * Critics left them unvisited until they had paid their respects to the first showing in years of the painting of the Mahatma Eilshemius . <P> All Manhattan art dealers know a little old gentleman with baggy trousers , a beard and a beady eye who is the city 's most persistent exhibition visitor . All of them know that he is Louis Michel Eilshemius M. A. , by his own admission painter , poet , musician , inventor , marksman , and " Ex Fancy Amateur Dancer . " He loves to buttonhole strangers in hallways and describe his own superior accomplishments . He was once wealthy . He is still listed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57th Street and has spent a fortune on strange pamphlets and books to prove that Elshemus or Eilshemius ( the spelling varies ) is the greatest artist the world has ever known . Eilshemius also states that Eilshemius has written music , invented a portable piano and a game known as " Sixers " ' ( like pinochle ) and adopted the title , Mahatma . <P> But the Mahatma Eilshemius is by no means a charlatan . He has been called the American Rousseau . His childish , sentimental painting has been described as " the type of thing . . . which would result were the rank and file of Americans capable of expressing themselves on canvas .

But he stopped painting in 1920 . A few have suspected that he realized then that his pictures of Samoa , his ruins by moonlight , his strange nude ladies bathing in improbable streams were as far as he could go . Last week he grew suddenly frank with his press agent . " I wo n't paint again , " said Louis Eilshemius , " I 'm just a comedian . " <P> <P> *Before the introduction of photo-engraving the U. S. illustrated magazines ( Scribner 's , Harper 's , Century ) employed a group of U. S. wood-block engravers of unmatched dexterity . They copied oil paintings , photographs , etchings , drawings . To the day of his death gaunt irascible Joseph Pennell urged their recognition by serious art critics . Most of them were of German descent . Timothy Cole , ablest , best-known , was British-born.
