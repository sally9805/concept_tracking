The art of designing beautiful clothes for women is no longer exclusive with a dozen dressmakers in Paris . During the past year U. S. designers have been well publicized , and a notion has got abroad that Paris is losing initiative in setting fashions . Downright U. S. citizens who rather hoped so were thoroughly disabused last week when U. S. buyers and wholesalers flocked into Paris like homing birds for Fashion 's greatest circus : the annual autumn openings of the great couturiers . <P> It was the hottest week of the summer . <P> Mannequins fainted under furs . <P> " Fashion news , " that mlange of contradictions and bug-eyed navets , made sense to nobody , will make sense only as weeks go by and a certain number of the high-priced creations , paraded last week , begin to appear , in copies , on millions of U. S. women . A few broad trends were seen , however , by practiced observers . At the end of the week unofficial tabulations revealed that the skirt , so far as length was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 in. from the ground . But full skirts , ranging from a gentle flare for daytime to romantic yard age for evening , were common , and observers who have watched this trend develop for several seasons conceded that this autumn it would probably be the rage . <P> Newer but not likely to become a fashion for another season or so was the " tubular " skirt with a slight flare at the knees . <P> Old hands at the Paris openings remarked a chastening of the fantastic extremes which make newspaper copy and which nobody ever wears . Most couturiers offered clothes that were flattering but wearable . Declaring that she aimed " to clothe rather than astonish , " Designer Gabrielle Chanel stole a march on her fellow big shots by opening a full weekend ahead of them , capitalizing on her noted simplicity . Near the centre line of fashion were oldtimer Chanel 's wool frocks with ruffles at wrist and neck , forward or " profiled " berets , dark velvet afternoon and dinner dresses , strapless evening gowns . <P> Gay and rakish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly designs in silhouettes with paper and shears . Her best ideas : new " doll " hats suggesting birds ' nests , in fur ; high-buttoned colored kid boots ; tiny electric lights on handbags and ornaments . Schiaparelli 's opposites , Vionnet and Alix , who pay heed to anatomy and do their designing on models , showed finely draped and molded dresses . The derivative-exotic appeared in the collections of Molyneux , who used vaguely Oriental touches , Lanvin , who offered Persian toques and flares , and Paquin , whose long , slim , golden gowns suggested the Chinese .
