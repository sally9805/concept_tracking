txt Granting that there is only the barest possibility of saving any of the 26 members of the crew still trapped m the submarine Squalus , Rear Admiral C. W. Cole , Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard in charge of rescue operations , declared today " all hope is not lost " and ordered resumption of diving operations . Divers thereupon went below in the repaired rescue chamber which was damaged slightly last night while bringing up the last of the 33 men rescued from the flooded submersible now lying offshore 40 fathoms below the mother ship Falcon . The divers are under orders to explore and examine the hull of the Squalus and ascertain if any of the men unaccounted for are still alive . Repairs Made " Repair of the rescue chamber has been completed . Will resume rescue operations on the after part of the Squalus , " was the Admiral 's word to newsmen at the Yard . This indicated that of two courses  --  attempting to raise the Squalus as she lies on the bottom , or enter the flooded compartments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . In this connection it was stated by Navy officials that no formal court of inquiry will be held until salvage operations have been completed . The divers ' orders , it was said , were to explore the after compartments and to attempt to close the valves through which the craft was flooded . In the event the valves can be closed , the water will be pumped out and the submarine brought to the top . If this is not possible , resort will be had to pontoons to bring the Squalus to the surface . Closed the Valve In the meantime today , Alfred G. Prien , machinist 's mate aboard the Squalus , who was in the control room assigned to closing the air induction valve through which the submarine is believed to have been flooded , said in an officially approved interview that lie did close this valve and that the lights on his control board showed it was closed until the lights went out . " My duties are to handle the levers and machinery controlling the vents , flood valves and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the proper valve , closed the main induction valve , so that water would not enter the submarine when we dove . I could tell that the valves were working properly and that the main induction valve was closed because lights flashed on and the lights will not show up unless the valve is closed . " As the ship leveled off at 50 feet a message came through to the control room that water was coining into the engine room . I checked the control board lights and saw that every valve was working properly and that none of the lights showed there was trouble with the valves . " Nearing the scene of the rescue operations are the Navy Tug Saga-more , carrying additional salvage equipibent , the lighter Los Angeles , and aprivately-owned tug , the Resolute , towing a scow and several pontoons . These vessels passed through the Cape Cod Canal this morning , the Sagamore and the Los Angeles coining from New York and the Resolute from New London , Conn . From the Third Naval District in New York word Caine today that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , has been ordered into Newport , R. I. , for coaling and there await orders to relieve the Brooklyn as station ship for salvaging the Squalus . Buoys have been set above the location of the Squalus by the lighthouse service and merchant shipping and pleasure - craft have been warned not to approach within 1,200 yards during the salvage work . The men taken off the Squalus yesterday afternoon and last night are now in the Yard . A group of 15 came in last night and another contingent at 2:30 this morning and the remainder around 10 a. m . Interviews were immediately demanded by the newspaper men and this forenoon was taken up largely with interrogating several members of the crew and Lieut . Oliver F. Naquin , commander of the Squalus . A delay ensued when these interviews , by selected men , were typed and then submitted to naval officers for official approval and then mimeographing for distribution to the entire news covering group . Diving Bell Called Engineering Triumph By a Staff Correspondent of The Christiaa Science Monitor WASHINGTON , May 25 ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval engineering for its rescue of 33 persons trapped in the submarine Squalus is itself a miniature submarine  --  except that its essential services of air , light , etc. , are supplied by a feeder ship on the surface . The bell with its 18,000 pounds of weight is hoisted off the rescue ship by a crane , and floated on the surface . A diver then takes the steel cable which pays out underneath , down to the sunken submarine and fastens it securely onto a special hook eye . When he returns , the crew  --  normally of two men  --  clambers down a hatch in the top of the bell , avoiding the ballast tanks which fiill the top section , into the control compartment which is the middle and largest of the three sections into which the bell is divided . There they have air pumped in steadily from the ship above , electric light , spare flash lanterns in case the light should fail , telephone , and all the control devices to operate the bell .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
