Russia 's birth rate is artificially stimulated by long northern nights , a ban on abortions ( abortion was legal in Russia from 1920-36 ) and cash prizes for prolific mothers . Her death rate is artificially stimulated by purges , famines and Manchukuoan border incidents . What the balance is will now be determined. * Dictator Stalin believes that there are 3,500,000 new Russians every year . Sent out last week to verify this were 400,000 census takers , armed with 16 questions apiece , conveyed by reindeer , camels , sleds cars , airplanes . <P> It is hoped that mistakes of the 1937 census , which was never published because it was " sabotaged " by " Trotskyist-Bukharinist traitors , " will not be repeated . Then some 1,000,000 census-takers set out to make a house-to-house canvass Many thought that the figures turned up then showed : 1 ) a decrease in population ; 2 ) too many Russians to be religiously minded for Soviet comfort . No question regarding religious belief or disbelief will be asked in the present census , nor will Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackeys or tramps . Soviet citizens will be occupationally grouped under broader terms . The classification for priests is " servitor of a cult " ; for one who does n't earn his living , " non-toiler " ; for artists , writers etc. , ' " members of a free profession . " <P> Major difficulty with census-taking in Russia is that the peasants are census-shy . In the days of the Tsar they fled from or fought with census officials , fearing that their women were about to be carried off or that all the aged and feeble were going to be boiled in soap . Today their fears are less fantastic , more shrewd : they consider counting noses just another way of picking victims for purges , taxation , the army . <P> <P> *According to last official census ( 1926 ) there are 147,000,000 Russians .
