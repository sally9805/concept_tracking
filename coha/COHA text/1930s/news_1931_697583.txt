txt Net income of Barg-Warner Corp . and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31 , 1930 , was approximately $2,650,000 , equal after preferred dividend requirements , to slightly less than $2 a share on 1,230,770 common shares outstanding . That would compare with 1929 net of $7,682,590 , equal to $6.02 a share on the same basis , a decrease of about 65Ci , Of the 1930 net profit , $2,375,371 was earned in the first six months and /the remainder , or about $275.000 , in the final siic months . In 1929 , $4.554,427 was earned in the first half of the year and $3,128,163 in the last half . Borg-Warner enters ' 1931 with encouraging prospects as a result of the development of several new products , of which the free-wheeling transmission , announced last fall , is likely to have the most pronounced effect on sales and profits . Control of patents on the free-wheeling principle is shared with Studebaker Corp . In fact , prospects are such that first quarter net profit this year should not be greatly below the $1.097,811 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first quarter of 1930 . Profit Gain from New Transmission Because of the greater intricacy of the freewheeling design and the greater amount of labor required to fabricate the free-wheeling transmission units as compared with the old transmission units , the manufacture of free-wheeling transmissions will , with no increase in unit sales over the 1930 figure , increase materially the dollar volume of Borg-Warner 's transmission sales this year . Profits on transmission sales will be increased proportionately . The free-wheeling unit already has been adopted as standard factory equipment by Studebaker . Hupp , Pierce Arrow and Lincoln . Requirements of these cars during 1931 together with other existing contracts , are likely to provide capacity operation for Borg-Warner 's present transmission plants . If . in the future , the Borg free-wheeling design is adopted by other manufacturers the company will be forced to increase its facilities to handle the additional business . There is another such device on the market . In addition to the free-wheeling unit , it is reported in trade circles that Borg has developed a device designed to carry engine vibration into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new is directed . No confirmation of this report , however , can be obtained from the management . Such a device probably would have the greatest appeal to manufacturers of small cars to whom vibration is a vexing problem . Releases of material commitments received thus far from automobile manufacturers for February delivery are the heaviest for many months and for two of Borg 's manufacturing divisions are larger than for February , 1930 . New Outlets ' for Soft-Center Steel Company 's Ingersoll Steel &; Disc division , which depends on the agricultural equipment industry for a substantial volume of its business . has developed several new outlets for soft-center steel and other specialty steels . These new outlets probably will offset to a large extent any decline in the demand from farm equipment companies In 1931 and will keep profits of the Ingersoll division close to normal levels . Norge Corp. , Borg 's electrical refrigerator division , has received commitments from dealers which are two or three times larger than at this time last year and has increased the number of its distributors to 23 from seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to common stockholders a total of approximately $3,384,617 or about 3734,617 more than was earned . Company paid a dividend of $1 a share in the first quarter , 75 cents a share in the second and third quarters , and 25 cents in the fourth quarter , making total payments of 32.75 a ligaraon share .
